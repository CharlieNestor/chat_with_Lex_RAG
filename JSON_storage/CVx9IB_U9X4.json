      "text": "- That's all that matters:\nthat he got there, that he got to the place\nto act like a fighter, to do what we want him to\ndo, to be ready to persevere, to go beyond the comfort\nlevel, to do another round. He didn't want to, damn\nright he didn't want to, but he knew we want him to. And he knew in order to pass\nthe test, he had to do it. He goes, now it's gonna\nbe your job to get him in the gym, make him mentally stronger, make him face things, and teach him how to slip\npunches and create holes, and fill those freaking holes\nwith devastating punches, this is Cus, with punches\nwith bad intentions. - The following is a\nconversation with Teddy Atlas, a legendary and at times\ncontroversial boxing trainer and commentator. When I was going to this\nconversation with Teddy, I was ready to talk boxing: styles,\nmatches, techniques, tactics, and his analysis of individual fighters like\nMike Tyson, Michael Moore, Klychko, Usik, Povetkin,\nLomachenko, \"Triple G\", Canelo, Muhammad Ali, \"Sugar\" Ray Leonard, Hagler, Duran, Floyd,\nand on and on and on. Like I said, I came ready to talk boxing, but I stayed for something even bigger, the Shakespearean human\nstory of Teddy Atlas, Cus D'Amato and Mike Tyson. It's a story about loyalty,\nbetrayal, fear, and greatness. It's a story where nobody is\nperfect and everybody is human. To summarize, in the early '80s, young trainer Teddy Atlas worked with his mentor Cus D'Amato in training the young boxing protege, now\na boxing legend, Mike Tyson. Mike was a troubled youth,\narrested over 40 times, and at age 15, he was\nsexually inappropriate with Teddy's 11-year-old niece. In response to this, Teddy put a .38 caliber\nhandgun to Tyson's ear and told him to never\ntouch his family again, or he would kill him if he did. For this, Cus D'Amato\nkicked Teddy out. Why? Well, that's complicated. In part, I think, to\nhelp minimize the chance of Mike Tyson, who Cus legally adopted, will be taken away by the\nstate and with him the dream of developing one of the\ngreatest boxers of all time. Of course, that summary doesn't capture the full complexity of human nature and human drama involved here. For that, you have to\nlisten to this conversation, the things said, and\nthe things left unsaid, the pain in Teddy's voice, the contradictions of love and anger that permeate his stories\nand his philosophy on life. Like I said, I came to talk\nabout boxing and stayed to talk about life. This conversation will stay\nwith me for a long time. The people close to you,\nthe people you trust, the people you love are everything. And if they betray you and\nbreak your heart, forgive them. Forgive yourself and try again. Happy holidays everyone. I love you all. This is a Lex Fridman\npodcast, to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Teddy Atlas."

      "section": "Lessons from father",
      "text": "You wrote in the book that your father had a big influence on your life. What lessons have you learned\nabout life from your father? - When you ask that question, you know, I remember Cus D'Amato\nwhen I was with him up in Catskill for all those years, and he used to say to me, \"Teddy, you learn through osmosis.\" I'd believe there's true to\nthat if I know what osmosis is. And I-\n(both laughing) but it sounds good.\n- Yeah. - But I learned through\nosmosis with my father. He wasn't a big talker. He\nwas, you know, he was a doer. And when you're around someone who lives a certain kinda life and does\ncertain things, it penetrates. - He was a doctor?\n- He was, I'm gonna sound like an idiot\nright now because I'm being a son, but he was the\ngreatest diagnostic doctor... I mean, if I say I ever\nknew, what's that mean? - Yeah.\n- You know what I mean? Are you a doctor? You know what I mean? Like, what does that mean? But other people have told me this. - Yeah.\n- Like just legendary stories. - He would do house calls\nand he'd help people. And like you said, a lot of people have spoken\nabout the impact he's had on their life. - He built two hospitals\nand he built those hospitals before any of us had a bridge in New York, connecting Brooklyn to Staten Island. And he built it so people could get proper hospital care that couldn't afford it, period. And everybody looked at him as eccentric. - Yeah. Nice.\n- Yeah, because he would literally sneak patients, not sneak 'em in, he was Dr. Atlas, he could do what he wanted\nto a certain extent, but he would bring patients in without administering,\nputting through administration. So there was no charge because, you know, they didn't have anything. They were street people. I remember being, my only way to be with my\nfather was to go on house calls. Or to go to the office.\nThere's no, you know? And so I went on house calls with him. And he did house calls, by the way, till he was 80, and $3. I mean, it was better\nthan like McDonald's, you know what I mean? I mean, the deal, $3 and you got medicine, you got everything. But he used to, right around the holidays, there was just certain things\nthat I didn't understand, but I understood later where we would just drive\ncertain areas and he just all of a sudden opened his door, he would pick up these\nhomeless and, you know- - Help 'em.\n- I'm 10 years old. You know, move over and\nmove over, you know? - And it's just you,\nhim and a homeless guy? - A couple.\n- A couple. - Yeah. Whatever he could fit in. Three, four. You know, whatever it was. - That's a big heart. - And then he took 'em to the\nhospital, dropped him off. So, you know, I would ask\nquestions after it was all over with, I'd say, \"Dad, they're sick?\" He goes, \"Well, not in the way where you put them in the hospital.\" So he said, yeah. And he tried to explain\nthings to me, you know, he would try... He didn't talk much unless\nyou ask him something. And that kind of works. And you know, don't talk unless\nsomeone asks you something. And he explained to me that, I said, well, \"Why are you putting 'em\nin the hospital then?\" You know, and of course the sickness was, they were alcoholics, but\nwhy are you putting 'em? It wasn't an alcohol rehab, you know, so why are you putting, and it wasn't for the purpose to dry out. He wasn't trying to cure them. Let's put that before we\nanoint him for sainthood. You know, like by Teddy Atlas. So I was like, we\nfinally get to the point, why you put him in there? Well, because it's the\nholidays. All right. Why you put him in there? Well, the holidays, you know, are good for certain\npeople and bad for others. And it was always before the holidays. It was before Christmas,\nbefore... Whatever. And New Year's, whatever.\nAnd so I said, \"Why?\" And he said, \"Because they\nremind people, certain people, of what they don't have.\" That other people enjoy the holidays because of what they have:\nfamily, you know, whatever. And it reminds them they're minus that. - That's pretty profound.\n- Yeah. And then, and I don't\nremember because he didn't use the word suicide, but I got it. Like he basically, I forget\nhow he said it, but like, I just got it. I don't know how I got,\nI suppose, I don't know. But I just got it like, so\nthey don't hurt themselves. That's what came across.\n- In every way. - I don't think he ever articulated that, ever verbalized that. But yeah. They don't hurt themselves. So, and well, how does that work? Well, just, basically they're\ngonna be around people. They're not gonna be alone.\nThey're gonna be around people. They're gonna get fed,\nthey're gonna be warm. Right? And it's gonna be for three\ndays, two-three days, whatever. And basically, it's a bridge. So the funny thing as a 10-year-old, I want to be connected to him. So I've enlisted myself in the job. When he used to drop them\noff, he would take them, get 'em in. Right? And then the thing that I know, again, he didn't say nothing. But you notice things,\nand, if you care enough, you don't notice nothing\nif you don't care. But if you care and if\nit's important, you notice. And this guy was important to me. I just was, I didn't know\nwhat a hero was. No clue. I loved Mickey Mantle. I love Willie Mays. I loved Muhammad Ali. I never, ever connected them\nin my mind as heroes. Never. My father. I didn't connect it that way. But he-\n- Looking back now... - Looking back, he was my\nfirst connection to a hero. - The two of you ever talk about how much you love each other? The word love... - The one thing that was not allowed. The greatest memory I have,\nmy father showing me love was, we were down in Florida at an airport. And we were, I was born in Miami. Don't ask where, I was passing through. And the rest of my\nfamily's born in New York. Staten Island. And so I was supposed\nto go back with, right? And I wanted to stay with my\nmother for whatever reason. And so he, you know, of\ncourse, conceded to it. And he's, okay. You know, whatever. And very quiet. Very... And there's a man who never\nshowed emotion to anyone. I mean, for the most, you know? Really. All of a sudden he just\nturned and kissed me on the forehead and left. And I was like, that's different. - Yeah. You still remember that, huh? - Yeah. Like, that's weird. - You lost him 30 years ago? How did that change you? - It made me realize that\nsome of the deals I used to make for God weren't realistic. When I was a kid, I used\nto make deals with God, let me die before my father. And then, you know, you get older and you\nhave kids, you're blessed. Why did you make that\ndeal? You know what I mean? Like, (laughs) thank you\nfor not taking me up on it. - Yeah, yeah.\n- Thanks. - [Lex] Yeah. (laughs) - You know?\n- Oh, yeah. You miss him? - I miss him in moments\nwhen I'd like to know what to do, and, you know, I remember when I would drive with him on the house calls, he\ndidn't listen to music. He was a guy, he read books\nto his, when he got older, he read books till blood\nvessels broke in his eyes. He only read nonfiction books. Science. He loved science. Wars. Generals. I mean, I cheated on a couple book reports because I didn't do\nthe reading of the book the night before, I had\na freaking, a book report to put in, \"Dad. I got a book report to do\non the war of Stalingrad.\" - Yeah.\n- Really. The war of Stalingrad. And who the freak could\ntell you where you get an A? I got an A. - Yeah. - I just wrote what he told me. He told me generals. He told me times. He told me strategy. He told me about the winter that came\nand destroyed the Germans. And the Soviets were tougher than- - You got an A?\n- And he told Soviets were tougher than the Germans. And, you know, the Germans\npicked on the wrong opponent. - Yeah.\n- I was already in the boxing business.\n- Yeah. - I didn't even know it.\n- Yeah. (laughs) - I didn't even know it.\n- Yeah. - Matchmaking, very important.\n- Yeah. - They mismatched. They made a mistake with\nthe picking the opponent. And so when we would\nbe driving in the car, my father would be in a trance. And, dad, he wasn't ignoring me, at all. He was just with his\nthoughts. He was wherever. He wasn't even hearing the radio no more. I always wonder where he was. I did. So I asked him one day. And just so we're driving,\nI said, I wanna know. So I said, \"Dad, what do you think when you're\nbasically in this place that I know you're somewhere?\" Where are you, what are you seeing? I actually said, \"What do you see?\" And he said to me, \"I see what could be. I see what could be.\" And I'm like, oh, all right."

      "text": "- I gotta ask you, when\ndid you discover boxing? When did you first fall\nin love with boxing? - When it saved me. - How did it save you? - I was a stupid, violent\nkid that was angry, not exactly knowing why I was angry. I'd fit in real good in today's society. Because there's a lot\nof angry kids out there that I don't think they\nknow why they're angry. I was just out there\ngetting in fights and I got this stupid thing from that. - Can you tell the story\nof how you got that? - I was just running around\ndoing stupid things, bad things. I hurt people, some people\nphysically, but I hurt my family. You know, that's BS,\nyou only hurt yourself. You know, that's a good way\nof, you know, alibiing it. You know? But if at some point the\ntruth usually finds its way... I'd like it to look like\nI was just hurting myself, but it wasn't, obviously. So I was just out on the streets with kids that didn't grow up in the\nneighborhood I grew up. I grew up in a neighborhood\nwhere a father was a doctor, and I walked down the street... The funny thing was, down the hill was a very tough neighborhood\ncalled Stapleton. And most of the people down there on the corners wish that\nthey could get up the hill. And I wished I could get down the hill. So I went down the hill, and I hung out with all these friends that became lifelong friends. And I gravitated to that because I... I figured out later a little bit. But, you know, I wanted family.\nWe were a disjointed family. We were, you know, my father was a doctor. He didn't have time for nothing but being a doctor, you know, I think when you're great at something, you sacrifice something too. You know, when you're\nreally great at something, so great that maybe God made you great and you're too great for your own good. And I don't know, it took me to these\nstupid, dangerous places. Dangerous for me, but\ndangerous for other people too. Because I got to the point\nwhere I was doing robberies on the street. I was fighting everybody. And you know what the most\ndangerous part about it was? And I came to this realization\non my own. All by myself. I figured out. I was really as dangerous, you know, these kids from the projects,\nsome of 'em, they got nothing. First of all, I learned you don't have\nto be poor to be poor. You don't have to be\ndeprived of certain things to be deprived. And, because you... At least\nto think you're deprived. And I was poor in a way that\nI didn't have the only thing I wanted to have, him. So here I am where I'm out\nthere doing these things. And what made me more, I was more dangerous than\nsome of these psychopaths. Well, I was a psychopath too, I guess, the way I was behaving. But some of these psychopaths\nthat really had nothing, you know, really would, you know, they obviously would kill you. I was dangerous almost in the same way, but for a different reason. I know it's ridiculous\nwhat I'm about to tell you, but I figured it out. 'Cause I felt it. I thought I was on a righteous path. I thought I had a right... Because it was gonna\nget me my father back. Why? Why? I mean, you know, you're a scientist, you couldn't figure this one out, because all the people that had him were injured\npeople, fractured people, screwed up people in some ways. But hurt, damaged people. So if I get damaged, I'll get him. So I was on a crusade, really a righteous crusade\nwhere I thought it was okay. I had permission. I had permission to do these\nterrible things, quite frankly. And to fight everyone. And I did. And then it came almost to a crash of doing all that, you know, winding up in Rikers Island, like an idiot. Not understanding the damage I did to this poor man that, you know, he was a great doctor and\nhe's gotta see his son and hear about, you know what I mean? Like, God, I was out\non that day, you know, with the guys that I grew\nup with now, you know, the guys from the projects\nfrom the, as I described, and I was with one of\n'em who, he's dead now. So I was with him and we were in a neighborhood, the\nneighborhood we grew up that I hung out and then, and he grew up in, Billy,\nhe came from the projects. And we got into a thing where somebody cut us\noff, we cut them off, you know, jumped out to fight. And, you know, it turned\nout there's like five or six of them and two of us. And we fought, you know, right on the side right there, only about a block from where\nI used to hang out and maybe a block and a half. And right in front of\nlike a Spanish bodega. And it really does happen in slow motion. I actually saw the guy, I was fighting the guys\nthat I had to fight, and then all of a sudden I\nwas able to get one guy out of the way a little bit. And I really, I noticed\nthe guy go into his pocket, and I knew why he was going\nin his pocket, you know? And when he came outta his pocket, I knew what it was right away. It was weird because in\nthe neighborhood guys used to hang out, they were\ninto this, you know, they get into fights like\nright on the streets. And they went to, at that time, they went into this cheap knife. But it was, they thought it was, well, we thought it was cool. It was a 007. And the cool thing, whatever, was that you could flick\nit, you could learn, and I learned how to flick, you know, but I never carried a knife. But when my friends would\nhave it, I would just, you learn how to, you could flick it open, not a switchblade, but\nflick it with your wrist. And I was like, here I am in the middle\nof this fricking fight. And all of a sudden, oh,\nthat's a 007, you know? And so I'm like, you gotta\nmake a decision, you know? And I got a split... I can either not do nothing, which wasn't, didn't seem\nlike a great, you know, a great option. I couldn't run away. - Why not? - 'Cause you gotta live\nwith yourself afterwards. And that's more difficult to\nlive with than whatever it is at that second, because\nthat don't go away away. - You couldn't live with\nyourself running away. - It's just don't go away. That thing, nothing to\ndo with being brave. It has nothing to do\nwith being brave, really. It's got to do with just\ncommon sense in life, that for me, whatever you're\ndealing with, it's over. It's done. Like okay, deal with it. Go to bed, whatever. But you do that, you\nknow that other thing. You gone, that never ends. This thing ends. - Memory of you being, let's say, a coward in that moment, that never ends. - The only thing I had\nat that point in my life, in my stupid mind, was a reputation. That I would stand up to certain things, that was like, and that for me was worth something, whatever. Because I didn't feel any\nworth to anything else. That was the only thing I\nfelt a connection of worth to. So... - [Lex] So you stood\nyour ground and got cut? - So I say, no. I made a decision. - Yes.\n- I stood my ground. But I actually, things\ndo slow down. They do. And I actually said it's 007, he's gonna flick it, and I didn't say, but he's gonna flick it. I get a split second, either, like I said, either I do nothing, whatever. Or I get to him before he gets it flicked. I went to get to it\nbefore he got it flicked. and I just as I got close\nto, I did him a favor. I walked right into a counter punch because I cooperated with him, I went right to him and just as I... He practiced more than I did\nwith the 007, apparently. Because he was like, boom boom, boom boom. And, anyway... - What did you think? What did you think that happened?\nThat was all slow motion. Did you think you might die? - Yeah. Well, not immediately. Took me a minute. I'm a slow learner. I put my hand up. Right? Wouldn't you? I guess so. And it went into my face. And that was it. It was gooey. It was warm and gooey. And I was like, I don't\nknow what this means, but I don't wanna know. But I think I know. And... And... - Did you think about\nyour dad, in that moment? - No. You know what I thought about it was, you don't know who anyone\nis until they're tested. And I learned that. Cus used to tell me, but I learned it. He used say, I remember one time Cus, I was a 17, 18-year-old\nkid up there and, you know, thought I was whatever I thought I was. And he said, \"You got a lot of friends?\" And I said, \"Yeah.\" 'Cause you know, I was\non the street hanging out with 100 kids at night,\nsometimes, on the street corner. So I was like, I don't know too many people\nthat hung out with 100 kids on the street, on a corner,\non a Friday, Saturday night. And I was like, \"Yeah,\nI got a lot of friends.\" He goes, \"Really?\" \"Yeah, really.\" He said, \"How about if I\ntold you might not have any, most likely you don't have any.\" And he goes, and then he\njust started this thing. He said, \"Everyone's gonna\nbe tested. You, me, everyone. 'Cause you don't know about\nnobody until they're tested.\" He goes, \"You know nothing.\" He goes, \"You know nothing until you know, until something happens to test if they were really a friend.\" And he told me this story about a guy, a guy came to him and he was upset. \"What are you upset about?\" He goes, \"I'm upset because\nI just lost a friend.\" You know, \"After 20 years of friendship, we're not friends no more.\" So coach looks at him, he goes,\n\"Let me ask you a question. What made you think you\nwere ever friends with him?\" Now the guy gets insulted,\nthe guy's, \"Did you hear me?\" He goes, \"I just told you\n20 years I've been friends with this guy. Why would you say that to me?\" He said, \"Well, I say it again. What makes you think he was your friend?\" He goes, \"Whatever happened\nin the 20 years other than chasing girls?\" 'Cause Cus figured that one out fast. \"Chasing girls and drinking\ntogether and whatever else you're doing out on the street. Whatever gave you the inclination\nthat he was a friend?\" He goes, \"Whatever,\nwhen did he risk himself to be your friend? When was it dangerous to be your friend?\" - [Lex] When was the friendship tested? - When was it uncomfortable\nto be your friend? And you know what the guy\nsaid? You can figure it out. You're a scientist. He said... He said, \"Today.\"\n- Yeah. - And today came for me. And today, today, today, today,\nkept coming for me, today. And that day, my friend\nBilly had turned out, while I was fighting these\nwhatever, five, six guys. And where was Billy? He was on the roof. He was on the roof. He was on the roof. He was my best friend. And so anyway, they\ntake me to the hospital. And here's the thing with my father. But one thing Billy did\ndo for me when he got off the roof, thank God,\nhe did, he dragged me, dragged me into this\nbodega, laid me on the floor and started putting towels. Right? And the towels,\nI vaguely remember this. They filled up with blood. I mean, completely, like drenched, like you put 'em under a shower. And I heard the bodega owner screaming, screaming, you know, like, (imitates screaming) you know, whatever. And everyone's screaming\nand there's chaos. And I'm like, I don't know. I'm calm. Weird. I'm like real calm. And I'm just in this place, where things are calm. (laughs) And all of a sudden\nI hear Billy, he's screaming, \"Call the ambulance,\" call the, (imitates screaming) you know, and nobody's doing nothing. Everyone's frozen. I'm starting to understand already, people get frozen in situations. People... The fear... Fear, fear, fear, fear,\njust paralyzes people. And I was going into a fear business. I was learning, I was learning, I was getting, learning, early PhD. - In fear?\n- Yeah. And all of a sudden,\ngenius, Billy, genius, really, street kid.\n- Yeah. - He jumps up on a freaking counter, jumps over the counter,\ngrabs the phone, calls 911, says a cop's been shot. And forget about it. It was crazy. All I remember after that, I'll tell you the couple\nthings I remember, lights, being put onto a stretcher, bounced around, you know, rushed. I felt everyone's anxiety,\nexcept mine. I had none. But I felt everyone's\nanxiety, everyone's fear, like it was all around me. It was like, wow, this is interesting. It's kind of, I know that's\nstupid, but like, well, this is interesting. - You really have an eye for fear. That's fascinating.\nYou're really studying it. - Well I had no choice. I got introduced in the crash course, and they put me in ambulance. And this is what I\nremember, to your point, I'm sorry it took so\nlong to get to it, I am, although I'll probably do it again before this conversation's over, but I- - It's all about the journey.\n- Yeah. We'll get there. We'll get there, pops. So I hear the cops say,\n\"We might lose him.\" And I'm like laughing to myself. I'm not laughing because I'm not, again, I'm not John Wayne, John\nWayne would've laughed, but I'm like, lose? You guys are stupid. You know, I didn't say\nthat, but I'm like, lose me? My father's the greatest\ndoctor in the freaking world. There's nothing to worry about. You people, all you people are all uptight and whacked out here with\nfear and there's nothing to worry about. Dr. Atlas is my father. So anyway, so they're taking\nme to the, and they said, \"We don't have time.\" I hear a couple things I\nremember, \"Don't have time, take 'em to,\" and they take me to the US Public Health Hospital, Marine Hospital it was called at the time, but US Public Health. And it's in Stapleton,\nso it's close, thank God. So they're taking me and I hear them on the radio, you know, saying this stuff about we\ngotta move, we gotta move. And I start talking. And they're telling me don't talk. And I like to talk a lot, you\nknow, and I'm so, again, fear. There's no fear when\nthe fear's been removed. It's the only time you're\nreally free in life. And I know that sounds\nabsurd, but really, it is. It's the only time you're\nreally free in life. I was, when you-\n- Close to death? - When you're devoid of things that normally hold you back,\nthat normally influence you, in ways, that, you know, that\nare not of the influence, that always positive influence, where you are in a pure place, where you're in a purely free place from all inhibitions, from\nfear, from anxiety, from joy. Joy can screw you up. And you're\nfree from all these things. And I'm in this place, - In the back of an ambulance you're free. - I'm, yeah, I'm like, I said, \"Just get me Dr. Atlas.\" And they say, \"We don't have time.\" No, no, no, no, no. You don't... You have to get Dr. Atlas.\nYou have to get him. This was the... Dammit. This was the... You know what I mean? I finally freaking hit the\nnumber and I'm not getting paid. And then all of a sudden I'm out. - How many stitches- - Well, I think it was 400, 200 inside, 200 outside or whatever it was. - It's a lot.\n- Hey, look, after 50, the number doesn't matter no more. Right? Whatever, 60, 70,\n80, 90, whatever, you know? So I was fortunate. I was fortunate. And of course they, I was fortunate, they told me afterwards, that he missed my jugular\nliterally by like a centimeter. I mean, whatever. And so then we wouldn't be having this conversation, obviously. - Well, I'm glad you made it.\n- Yeah. I'm kind of glad too. And it just missed my\neye, which, thank God. It's bad enough, have a scar,\nimagine me with a patch? I mean, it's enough that\nI got this freaking thing. And look, it goes all the\nway, you know, I mean it's, you know, it's pretty long. And... I don't know. I was out and then\nsomehow I sensed like they had the curtain closed, you know? And it's amazing how vivid this is. And the curtain's closed\nand I see a shadow. I felt a presence. I did. And I felt him. He's a powerful guy. And I felt him. And I just\nsee like a shadow, you know? And all of a sudden the\ncurtain gets pushed back, and I can't really see,\nit's dark and I'm, you know, out of it, but not completely out of it. And pushes the curtain back, comes in, and his hands, even though it's all\nbandaged, you know, whatever. But his hand surveys. It felt safe, and it felt warm and safe. I was happy. And he got there, you know? - Did he say something?\n- Yeah. Yeah. Remember, I gave you a\nlittle bit of introduction to my father, right? You know him now a little bit, right? - Yeah, yeah. What'd he say about the job? - He said, he just said,\nthis is what he said. I remember to this day what he said. - Yeah.\n- That I do remember. I don't know if it was six or five people, but this I do remember. He said, \"They did a good job. You're gonna have a scar\nthe rest of your life.\" And he left. - Oh man, they did a good job."

      "text": "You mentioned Cus D'Amato,\nlegendary trainer. And you also mentioned it turned out he really cared about you in the book you write\nabout a testimony he gave. I was hoping I could read it 'cause it speaks to your\ncharacter, it speaks to his, it's just powerful. The testimony goes, \"Your honor, I realize you might\nnot know much about me, but I've spent my whole\nlife developing young men. As a boxing manager, I trained two world champions, heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson and light heavyweight\nchampion Jose Torres. I've also helped a lot of other young boys\nstraighten out their lives and build character. I know things about Teddy\nAtlas this court doesn't know. Things you won't find\non his arrest record. This boy has character. He has loyalty. He'll hurt himself before\nhe'll let down a friend. These qualities are rare\nand they shouldn't be lost. He's made mistakes.\nWe've all made mistakes. But I've come to know this\nboy, and if we lose him, we'll be losing someone who\ncould help a lot of people. Please don't take this\nyoung boy's future away. He could be someone\nspecial. Let's not lose him. Please...\" Those are powerful words\nfrom a powerful man. What have you learned about\nlife from Mr. Cus D'Amato? - He gave me a quote and\nhe drilled into my head. I became his guy. You know? He loved me, I loved him. He said to me, \"Teddy, no matter what a man says, is what he does in the end that he intended to do all along.\" That's what I learned from Cus. Rest of it is BS. And a lot of people say things, you just have to give him a minute to let them show you, eventually, what they really meant by it. I also learned from him that everyone's afraid, Cus's way of saying, another great saying, you'll get kick outta this, \"Anyone who's in a situation where fear should be prevalent, where fear is actually\nnecessary to survive the situation, anyone who says that they're not afraid,\nthey're one of two things: They're either a liar or\nthey should go to a doctor, find out what the\nfreak's wrong with them.\" He was right about that. You know, we live in a taboo\nsociety where that word, to a certain extent, is taboo\nbecause it invokes weakness. You know? We are just layers of what\nwe saw and learned since we were kids. We all are. We're\nproducts of those layers. I learned that on my own.\nWell, through some help. At the end of the day, you know, fear, people will find their\nway of avoiding that term. So they use the word anxiety, they use the word, you know, butterflies, apprehension, you know, a million different words. I find all those other\nwords to be cousins of fear. And fear... Fear causes\na lot of things in life. It causes a lot of problems. And it also solves a lot of problems. Without it, we couldn't be great. If we are great, if we ever\nhave a chance to be great, or at least to aspire to be great. - How does fear connect to greatness? That's a profound statement. Without fear we wouldn't\nbe able to be great. - Yeah, you couldn't be great without fear because fear allows you to be brave. The most important word for me in this whole, you know,\nconversation, right, neighborhood, would be selfishness. And it allows you to be\nfor a moment less selfish. One of the things I\nlearned, I guess partly on my own, everyone thinks\nmy greatest teacher was Cus. He was a great teacher, mentor, my greatest teacher was my\nfather, the one who never talked. And I realize one of the things to be better towards great is if you can submit less than we submit. See, one of the things that I'm afraid of, one of the things, I was always quitting,. In my business, it's\nkind of not a good thing. - Every business, I think.\nYours is just more clear. - Yeah. And it hurts more. - (laughs) True, in the moment, at least. - Yeah. In the moment. But you're right, 100% because some things hurt\nfor a long time afterwards, and something like regret. Regret is the worst thing in the world because it's a solitary sentence. And, man oh man... - That's a powerful phrase. Regret is a solitary sentence. Oh boy. You're full of good lines. - (laughs) You know, it wasn't\neasy to accumulate them. - Yeah- - It was a little bit hurtful, but so... Submit less. Because we submit every\nday and if we can get to a place where we submit so compromise ourselves less, we'll get to a better place. You know, again, one of the\nwords for me that attaches to things that give you, that wind up hurting you\nin life and have hurt me in life, one of those\nboogeymen words is the word of convenience, that's\nattached to everything. You know, people disappoint you not because they wanna disappoint\nyou or let you down or betray you because\nthey wanna betray you. They do it because it's\nmore convenient to do than the other thing. An old man once told me, he said to me, I was trying to rationalize something, I was trying to make an\nexcuse for something, I was trying to make\nmyself better than I was, I was trying to say it was okay. And he just looked at me, and he liked me, and he said, \"Teddy, there ain't no such thing\nas being a little pregnant.\" I was like, yeah. Goes, \"Either you're pregnant\nor you're not pregnant, either you're real or you're\nnot real, either you're, you know, truthful or you're not truthful, either you're tough or you're not tough, either you're, you know, committed or you're not committed, either you in or you're out.\" - That applies to a lot of things. - Yeah.\n- Including loyalty. - That's quite a statement. But the lifeblood of\nhumanity for me is loyalty. It's what goes through the veins of, you know, everything has to\nhave some veins in some form. And if humanity has veins, what runs through the veins\nof humanity instead of blood to keep it alive is loyalty. Without loyalty's-\n- That's powerful words. - Without loyalty, we are dead. We're freaking walking, we're vessels. I never understood what a ghost ship was. You know what? As I got older, I know\nwhat a ghost ship is. It's people. It's people that are empty. They got no loyalty, therefore\nthey got no humanity. Therefore they got nothing.\nTherefore, freak them. Freak them. Because, and you know why\nthey don't have loyalty? Convenience. And you know why? Because it's hard to be\nloyal. It's actually hard. I'll be a son of a gun... If you're telling me,\nyeah, it sounds great. Give it to me, give it\nto me, paint me with it. Yeah, it's great. Yeah. I'm loyal. I'm, yeah, this is good. I'm ready. I'm on that team. I'm ready. Put me in coach. I'm ready. \"Okay, now, you have to, you're gonna have to get hurt here.\" \"What do you mean, get hurt?\" \"Oh, well, it's gonna be painful. I mean, to be loyal, you know, you're gonna be in\ndanger because the person that you committed your\nloyalty to, for a reason, because obviously did something in your life, whatever, whatever, you are actually gonna get\nhurt to be loyal to 'em, you're actually gonna...\" \"Hold on a minute. Wait, hold on a minute, coach. Hold on. Call timeout here. Let me think about this, coach, I might need more practice. I'm not ready for the game. I'm not ready to go in the game yet. Gimme a little more practice, coach.\" And it hurts to be\nloyal. It freaking hurts. But without loyalty, we're ghost ships. We got no strength. We got nothing. We got nothing. We got nothing. - I agree with you in a\ndeep fundamental sense, but there's pain that comes with that. I have to ask you to\nintrospect on this part of your life, because of\nyour value for loyalty,"

      "section": "Mike Tyson",
      "text": "as people know, you and Cus\nD'Amato trained young Mike Tyson and the interaction there between the three of you led to the three of you parting ways. Given your value for loyalty, can you tell the full story of what led up to this and maybe the pain you felt from that? - It was, I guess it was\nthe second time in my life I felt betrayed. The first time was when I was, whatever, young, 17, and I got arrested. I was with all these older\nguys, tough guys, whatever. And, supposedly... And the detectives separated us. That's what they do. And you know, they asked\nme who did whatever, who's gun, this, that, you know, all that, the particulars of obviously what we did. And, you know, \"It was me.\"\nAnd they say, \"You sure?\" You don't wanna change\nthat? You don't want... 'Cause your friends changed it. And these cops, they were\nnasty, but they were cops. They were the way, you know, you're gonna wind up in Rikers with, and they're gonna be doing this to you. And I won't even say\nthe things because then why say them, you know, figure it out. But, you know, they're trying\nto get what they're trying to get and, you know,\n\"You wanna change it?\" And... No. But I felt very betrayed, you know? And especially when I\nwas standing in the cell in Rikers looking at the\nairplanes leave LaGuardia Airport. And then hoping I was on one, you know, I was making like a deal with\nGod that let me be on one of those planes and let it crash. I'll take a shot. - Was part of you proud that you didn't give up your friends? - No, because I didn't\nunderstand what proud was. I didn't understand nothing.\nI just understood that... - Rules are rules. You're\njust loyal and that's it. - I didn't even know there was an option. I didn't think there... I know the cops said you could do this, but that there was no option. My father never had an option. But the betrayal, the\nprivate betrayal was like, and so when Cus... We were partners, me and Cus. - Yeah.\n- Cus was retired. This stupid kid goes up\nthere and all of a sudden I start training fighters. First I wanted gloves,\nCus put me in the gloves, I wanted gloves that I had into, whatever. But bottom line is I still wanna fight. I want to turn pro, I wanna\nfight. That was the plan. And Cus had a different plan. Cus was like, you can't, and he had it set up a\nlittle bit, whatever, without getting into it,\nhey, he did me a favor, and I'd like to think he\nknew he was doing me a favor. And you know what? I do think he was. He was doing himself a little bit one too. But he was doing for the greater cause because he believed in\nthis thing of boxing. He believed that it changed lives. He believed that it was worthwhile. He believed that there was a power to it beyond the left hook. - The big picture of\nboxing. He believed in it. - Yeah. He believed that to be a\nchampion, you had to be special. You had to be smart, you had\nto have character. You had... That you had to be a better person and that you couldn't make a champion if you didn't make him\na better person first. And that this, you know,\nthis could strengthen people. The sport could strengthen\npeople in those ways. So he was married to it, and he was old and he needed, there was no one in the gym. It was empty. And it was above a police\nstation, which was crazy. And he needed an heir to the throne. He needed to pass it on to someone. And he saw something. And all of a sudden he saw that my career as\na boxer was less important than having me become\nhis an heir to the throne and become his trainer, his\nman, his guy, to continue, that we could do a lot more\nfor him and for everyone. Not just for him, but for everyone. It was more like to keep it\ngoing. Like it couldn't die. It couldn't die. And Cus was afraid that\nit would die with him. And he committed his whole life to it. He didn't get married because of boxing. So he saw me as, you know,\nthe little bit of, you know, the seed to plant for more things to grow before that plant died. And so he, all of a sudden\nhe says, you can't fight. And I had people tell me that\nI could go somewhere else and fight, and I could, but I couldn't. - Right.\n- 'Cause I'd be disloyal. - Loyalty's everything.\n- Yeah. So I couldn't leave Cus.\nAnd he kind of knew that. And so, you know, I couldn't leave him. And he said, \"You have\nan ability to teach.\" He said, \"Knowledge means nothing.\" He said, \"See these Britannica?\" He had Britannica encyclopedias, the whole set in our library. He said, \"You see these?\" Yeah, I see 'em. \"All the knowledge of the\nworld,\" whatever, \"is in these.\" All right. \"Means nothing if you don't have somebody to convey it to people. Otherwise, it just sits on\na bookshelf. It looks good.\" He goes, \"You have the ability to convey knowledge to people. You are a teacher. You\nwere born to be a teacher. You'd lessen yourself by only being a champion fighter because\nyou'd only take care of one person. You could take care of all kinds of people and you could do this and you could do that and you could do this.\" So we go on this venture, took a minute, 'cause I didn't believe him at first. But finally we, I am, I'm\nthere, I'm training fighters. And then he gets me to buy in, and I was a teacher and I\nstart teaching these kids and there's no one and the gym, it's dead. And all of a sudden there's 10 kids, 15,\n20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45. Catskill Boxing Club, which was\nnever there. Now it's there. And I'm training fighters. I'm taking 'em down to South\nBronx to get experience. One of his former fighters\nknows some others, down to South Bronx, I'm taking down there to get smokers, to get fights when they're\nready, after I teach, I'm wearing out dungarees. I'm getting holes in my dungarees. I was fashionable before\nit was fashionable to have holes in my dungarees. I could've made a lot of money with that. 'Cause I was on my knees\nwith these little kids, 9 years old, 10 years old, 8\nyears old, 10 year, 12, 13, 14. All these kids. And I'm teaching and I'm building a gym. And Cus only came once a week because he was semi-retired, you know. And when he would come once a week, he knew he couldn't gimme money, but he gave me more than money. He gave me praise. Oh. And he said, \"Look what Atlas is doing, he's creating champions!\" And I was like, whoa. Yeah. Wow. I'm doing good. And then all of a sudden,\nafter four years of that, 'cause I was up there\nseven years, eight years, eight years, after about three and a half, four years of that, we get a phone call that\nthey got this kid in prison in Tryon Prison, from one of the guys that knew Cus, Matt Pereski. And there's a state, there's a correctional\nofficer named Bobby Stewart who used to box and Cus had\nhelped him out a little bit. A little bit. And they knew we had this gym now that was really starting\nto become something, because we were winning\ntournaments and everything else. They're going, we got\nthis kid, Mike Tyson, he's 12 years old. He's 190 pounds. He's a mess. But Bobby Stewart got\ninvolved with him, you know, the former fighter. And he's taken a liking to it. And now where he didn't behave at all and he didn't listen to\nanyone now he's listening because Bobby's got a\ncarrot and the carrot is he teaches boxing. And now he's at the point\nnow where we want you to take a look, you and Teddy. All right. Bring him down. - What'd you think when\nyou first saw Mike Tyson? - Well, I wanted to see\nhis birth certificate. 'Cause he, 190 pounds, 12\nyears old and all solid? - Yeah. - You know, really? But yeah. - Just physically, just\nas a physical specimen? - Yeah. And...\n- Big guy. - Yeah. And listen, Cus was\nright. I was a teacher. He was right. And he was\ntesting me even that day. He said, \"What do you think?\" So I said, well, we ain't\ngonna know nothing in the bag. Who the freak cares about that? He knocked the bag down. We gotta put him in with, who, we got no one to put him in that way. They didn't have anyone\nthat way. We gotta test him. Everyone's gotta be tested. And so you gotta put 'em in, responsibly. But let's put him in. Just responsibly. But let's put him in with Bobby\nStewart, former pro fighter, had 14 pro fights. Smaller than Tyson. He was, when he was fighting, he was 175. But still, he's 28 years old. Tyson's 12. Come on. And he'll work with him. Right? So we do, we put him, Tyson,\nhe recognized the moment, he understood this was an\naudition, this was a chance, you know, this was that TV show. Change your life. And he understood that if\nhe passed the audition, he could change, possibly change his life. He wasn't sure what, how\ncould he be sure what exactly, but it was better than what he had. And so he was on audition. So he wanted, he innately understood what we would wanna see. Ferociousness, toughness,\ncharacter, desire, you know, and of course ability. Well, we saw the ability, power, speed. But it was unbridled. It was untaught. It was raw. He didn't\nknow really much at all. At all. But we saw that. But he wanted to show more.\nHe knew that wasn't enough. Again, innate intelligence.\nHe had to show desire. He had to show toughness. And so I was being responsible, after two rounds, that's enough. Normally I don't put a guy into boxing until maybe four months,\nfive months, six months, eight months, 10... It depends what it takes to\nlearn on the floor before it's responsible to put him\nin a ring to actually take on incoming real live\nshells instead of blanks. And so normally I wouldn't have him in, and I knew after today, he wouldn't be in the ring\nagain if I trained him, I would teach him first\nand then he'd get back in a few months. But for this day, it was the\nonly way, it's kind like, I used to make this\nannouncement and Cus loved it. He said, what's training a fighter? What do you look for\ntraining a fighter, Teddy? You know, he asked me this\nridiculous question just to test me. And I say, \"It's like\ngoing to Macy's with...\" Oh, he loved it. I said, \"It's like go to Macy's window.\" And Cus, he goes, \"What do\nyou mean, Macy's window?\" You know, Cus was like boom boom boom. \"What do you mean Macy's window?\" \"Oh, you go to Macy's window\nand they get the window with everything you wanna see, everything in there and it looks great. Oh, everything.\" \"And, yeah. And then what?\" \"Well then you ask\nwhat's in the warehouse, and they tell you nothing.\" (Lex laughing) And Cus says, \"That's\nit. That's a trainer.\" And I wanted to see what\nwas in the warehouse. 'Cause I saw what was\nin the Macy's window. I saw the power, I saw the speed. So he goes two rounds and\nhe gets a bloody nose. Here's the weird thing,\nnot weird, very telling. We knew what we were doing. Not bragging, but we\nknew what we were doing, because he got a bloody\nnose because he got hit. After that bloody, he never\ngot another bloody nose. You know why he didn't get\nhit? 'Cause he learned. He was still strong,\nbut he was smarter now. Anyway, he goes two rounds and I saw, and I'm being responsible\nbecause if he goes more, it's not responsible. I saw what I needed to see. I saw speed, I saw\npower, I saw athleticism. And I saw, I didn't believe him. I thought he was lying to me. I'm just telling you,\nI thought he was lying, trying to act tough when he\nwasn't really feeling tough. It didn't matter. Cus questioned me on it\nafterwards, \"What did you see?\" And when I said, he goes, \"Young master,\" you know, again, he wasn't paying me money,\nso he had to gimme something. Right? And that was better\nthan, that was currency. \"Young master.\" I'm young master, whoa,\nyou know, \"young master,\" you know what I mean? Like, I felt like that\nguy kung fu, you know? Like in the movie, like\nkung fu, grasshopper, when you're ready, when you could take this\noutta my hand, you can leave. And...\n- That's powerful. - Yeah. It was. It worked, Cus knew how\nto work me. And he did. And it worked. And but you know what, I\ndidn't mind being worked. I kind of knew I was being\nshuffled a little bit. - Well you're making it\nsound a little bit negative, but it's also extremely positive. That's a teacher\ninstilling wisdom into you that you carried forward and\nimpacted a lot of people. - Yeah. Cus get the job done.\nBut he did it his way. And he did it for a myriad of reasons. And, but at the end of\nthe day it was all good. And I just had to understand\nthat eventually, later on. But... - And you do the same, you do things your way and\ncarry some of him in you, some of your father in you. - Yeah. That day... You know, that day was\nfunny because when Cus said, what did you see, Teddy? With him, after two rounds,\nI got up in the ring. I knew I was gonna train him. Obviously we weren't gonna say no. And he still had about\nfour months to serve and we were gonna work it out. - [Lex] Yeah. - And when I got up on the ring apron, that's my gym, I'm the boss. You know, people later on\nin life call me a dictator. You know what they said?\nYeah, you're right. I didn't deny, people\nthought, you mean I'm right? Yeah. I'm a dictator. I'm a trainer. I'm the boss. I'm in charge. You wouldn't be here if I wasn't. What the frick you need me for if I'm not freaking in charge? You idiot. Yeah, yeah. Damn right. Well, what do you think? it's a shared responsibility? No, it's my responsibility.\nThat's why you're here. Yeah. Yeah, I am in charge. And you shouldn't be here if\nyou don't understand that. So I get up there and I know that I'm gonna be training them. I gotta show 'em who the boss is. You know, I'm being\nreally frank about this. So I get up there, I say,\n\"That's it, out. No, no.\" You know, this is Tyson. \"No, lemme go. I wanna do another round.\nI wanna do another one. I want... I said out. Did you hear what I said? Because I knew that, you\nknow, he was gonna test me. He was testing me. \"I said get out.\" He got out. - But were you impressed\nwith the fact that he wanted to keep going or no? - Yes, and I recognized\nwhat it really was. So Cus asked me, \"What was that?\" Cus wanna know what the young master saw. So Cus said, \"What was that?\" I said, \"It was an act.\" He goes, \"You saw that? Did he really wanna go?\" I said, no. I said he didn't really wanna go, but he knew that we want him to go and he made himself ready\nto go in order to satisfy. And that's just as good. And Cus said, damn\nright it's just as good. All that matters was not how he got there, but that he got there. That's all that matters.\nThat he got there. That he got to the place\nto act like a fighter. To do what we want him to do. To be ready to persevere, to\ngo beyond the comfort level, to do another round. He didn't want to, damn\nright he didn't want to, but he knew we want him to. And he knew in order to pass\nthe test, he had to do it. And he said, you are right. He goes, now it's gonna\nbe your job to teach him, to make him a fighter that\ndon't get bloody noses, that don't get hit, and we'll get to that\nplace without being coerced to get there, to get to\nthat place on his own, instead of using the things\nthat he had to use to get to that place today. Those things are not going\nto be available one day, when you, and listen to this, you talk about a man being prophetic 'cause it's pretty good. You talk about man being on\nthe job, on the money, Lex, he says, how do you think\nhe finishes the sentence? He goes, because someday\nyou, because, you know, you're gonna have to make sure that he learns these\nthings because, you know, he'll be your first heavyweight champ. What did you just say? He's 12 years old. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - He's been arrested 30 times. - [Lex] Yeah. - He's getting outta\njail out of, you know, juvenile detention try out, he's a mess in a lot of ways. There's a lot of things we find out later, a lot of problems, weaknesses. He goes, and you are,\nthat's part of your job. That'll be part of your job. And, but he really said that\nhe, and then he turned to him. He goes, \"You wanna come\nlive with us, young man? You wanna be a fighter?\" \"Yes.\" Even that, Cus said to me later, what do you think about that? I said... - [Lex] The way he said yes. - The, yeah, the way he said, \"Yes, sir.\" Yeah. He said, \"What do\nyou think about that?\" And we're talking, I said, ain't gonna be that polite in\na little while down the road. Again, he knew that that's\nwhat he felt that he needed to project himself as to\npresent himself as to get to where he wanted to get to. He goes, you know? Yeah. - Did you see what Cus was seeing in terms of the heavyweight champion of the world? - No. Again, the easiest\nanswer would be yes. Teddy's just, Teddy knows, genius. Wow. Teddy's wow. No no. No. No. But again, it was my job. And I just, my job, it was\nsimple, simpler than Cus, Cus knew too much. I knew nothing. I just knew, you know,\nrudiments of boxing, I knew what it took to be a\nfighter and how to execute it. The steps of executing\nit. So I took those steps. The rest of it, you get\nblurred by those other things. I wasn't blurred by those other things. It was just, get 'em in the gym, make 'em mentally stronger, make 'em face things and\nteach 'em how to slip punches, and create holes, and fill those freaking holes\nwith devastating punches, this is Cus, and what are you gonna do? I'm gonna teach 'em to\nfill holes and fill 'em with punches with bad intentions. And that became the moniker. And then Tyson would say that I'm throwing punches\nwith bad intentions. Yes, you are. And, you know... - How do you make him mentally tougher? So that part of the job, the, you said the don't get a bloody nose, but the part of the job, what\nmakes him mentally tougher? How do you do that? - Most important part of the job. To make him face things. Make him face where he\nis lying to himself, where he's submitting. But we start this conversation\nwith submission. Submit less. Submit less. Submit less every day. Submit less. Cus only come\nto the gym once in a while. And if I had him sparring, he would come because\nthat was his project. That was the heavyweight. Now he came, you know, it put\nlife in Cus, Cus had life, he was losing a little life. But that made the light\nbulb bright again. It did. And it was great to see.\nI felt proud of that. I felt connected to that. And that's why when it\nall went bad and Cus took the side that... The only side he could take, the side of the next\nheavyweight champ of the world. But he left me, his\npartner, the Young Master. And of the second time I\nget betrayed and I'm like, for a while I thought\neverything Cus taught me, said to me was a lie. I didn't wanna be any part of it any more. Until I got a little more mature, and I got a little past\nthat where I was able to understand, I was able to understand that just because so many that you perceived\nas great in every area is you find to be weak in certain areas, doesn't mean that they can't\nstill be what they want to you. It's something that can\nbe understood or forgiven. It's hard, it's hard to get to that place, to forgive somebody in that kind of way that I felt betrayed. Because Cus told me the most\nimportant thing was loyalty. Cus told me he loved\nme because I was loyal, Cus told people that the\nreason that he went to court was because I didn't give up anybody, even though it meant put me\nin the risk of going to jail for 10 years. And Cus felt that he admired those traits. And so I assumed that he\nwould show the same traits. And he took a deal. He took a deal. He took a deal. He signed the papers\nthat those so-called feds might've signed. You know, he took a deal to, you know, to have the future heavyweight\nchamp as it turned out. And to let me, you know, to\nlet me go, to sign the deal, to let me take, you know, take the weight. - For people who don't know, Mike was inappropriate with\na young girl and you pulled the gun on him. I don't know if there's\ndeeper things to say about that situation, but\nwhy do you think Cus made the decision to cut you\noff from both Mike Tyson and from Cus, Cus D'Amato,\nlike to break that, when he valued loyalty so much. - I served my purpose, I got him to where he needed to get,\nbrought life back in the gym. If I wasn't in the gym\nat that particular time, Tyson never would've been in the gym. There would've been no\ngym to bring him to. When they called up and made\nthat phone call to bring him to the gym, there\nwould've been no activity. There would've been no boxing program. There would've been, you know, no trainer training\nhim 24/7 the way I was, where Cus wasn't capable\nof doing that at that point in his life. But then again, it's not, poor Teddy. I get the benefit of a career. I get the benefit of knowledge.\nI get the benefit of a life. I get the benefit of learning\n,of becoming hopefully a better person. I got the benefit of being betrayed again. - That's a hell of a\nstatement right there. I don't know what the benefit of that is. - You can learn to forgive weakness. You know? When you realize how easy it is to be weak. And when you realize\nthat, somebody asked me, how did you get to the point\nwhere you could forgive? Right? It's a pretty good question. Pretty simple, pretty basic,\npretty important. Right? And I didn't understand, I understood, but I did understand,\nimmediately, for me, I said, how can I not forgive somebody? It becomes easier to learn how to forgive when you're still trying\nto forgive yourself. When you're still in the process of trying to forgive yourself for all\nyour own inherent weaknesses and betrayals of people, like my father, in different ways that\nwe forget very easily because it's handy and\nit's a way of surviving. It's a lot easier to figure\nit out, rationalize it, to find forgiveness when you realize that you still haven't\nfigured out completely how to forgive yourself. I'm still trying to figure that out. And so that helped me figure out how to forgive Cus, because to figure out how to forgive me, I had to understood\nwhy I did these things. Where the weaknesses came from, where the selfishness came from, where the convenience came\nfrom, that they really existed. But they didn't exist for malice. They existed for me not\nbeing prepared to understand that I could be stronger,\nto wanna be stronger. And then I looked at Cus,\nhe wanted to be stronger, but he got to a point in\nlife where he had been strong for a lot of his life. He was strong with me. He was strong with a lot\nof things in his life. And does everyone deserve\na pass in life, where... He got to a place where\neverything was in one basket. The basket of boxing. He once told me that he never got married 'cause it would've been selfish to a woman to have gotten married when\nhis whole life was boxing. That he couldn't give to a\nkid. He couldn't give to her. He couldn't... And then I thought about\nit, he had no money, really. And Jim Jacobs and Bill\nCaden took care of the bills. So he didn't really need money that way. But the one, what was the\npayoff of that kind of life? That kind of commitment?\nThat kind of sacrifice? Really, what was the payoff? The payoff was to have champions. To have a champion that\nwould keep your name alive. You know that word, legacy?\nLike what does it mean? Sometimes it's just a word.\nSometimes it's more than a word. It's as a reprieve, it's a pension plan. Is being given a pension on\nyour way out for the rest of your life. For your life. Wherever you're going. You're going to... Wherever\nyou're going for eternity. It's the only thing that you take with you is what you left behind. And for Cus, it was all\nabout leaving behind a mark, a mark, that of champion. Yeah, it was attached\nto ego. We all have it. Yeah. it was attached to some\nselfishness and all, but, yeah, it was also attached to wanting to leave something great behind. To know that you were part of it. That you existed for a reason. That you sacrificed for a reason. And all that freaking\npain I brought my father, I was searching for something. Yeah, I made it into a righteous search. I made it into, I did. And I made it into, it was\nokay because it was righteous. And I, but it still did\ndamage. It still did damage. It still hurt people. It still\nbetrayed my father's trust. And Cus betrayed mine. But he didn't do it maliciously. He did it out of, again... My father came home. This is how I'm gonna connect it. My father came home from\nwork one night, 12 o'clock, and I was waiting out, and like I said, I was over 9-10 years\nold and he got mad at me. He goes, \"Go to bed.\nWhat are you doing up?\" I said, \"I'm waiting for\nyou. I'm waiting for you.\" And he said, \"Well, go to bed.\" I said, \"No, What were you doing?\" He said, \"I was at the\nhospital.\" You were there... \"Why were you there so late?\" You know? He answered me. He said there was a patient,\nthere was a sick patient. I said, \"Oh, he must be better now, because you're his doctor.\" You know, because my\nfather could fix anything. My father, nothing got in the\nway of the truth. Nothing. Nothing. Even blowing his son's bubble. Matter of factly he said to me, \"No, he's not gonna get better. He is gonna die.\" And... So as a 9-year-old kid,\nyou know, you're a kid. You're selfish. You know, not in a bad way, but, you know, you want what you... And I said... I said two things. First I said, how, you are\nhis doctor, how? It can't be. And then I said, I just\nsaid it almost angry, \"Then why were you there?\" Like, you should have been here with me. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you know what he said to me? \"'Cause you don't give up on life. Go to bed,\" and... - Don't give up on life. - And that's, I finally\nconnected the dots. This idiot, that didn't\ngraduate high school, I finally connected the dots. I was asking Cus to give up on life. You don't give up on life. You don't give up on aspirations of life. Life is all forms of life. It doesn't have to be a\nphysical form of it. It's life. It's having a reason to be alive. It's having a reason to have tomorrow. And Cus's only reason to have tomorrow was to have another heavyweight champ. And Teddy Atlas, even though we were together all those years, and we were partners\nand we trained together and we were, you know, the only thing we didn't\ndo was what they did in the Indian movies\nwhere they cut the finger and they became blood brothers. That's the only thing we didn't do. And I felt like we did\nthat. Without cutting. And now here we are.\n- And still... - And he freaking betrayed me, this! And then all of a sudden\nI connected the dots. I was like, he didn't betray\nme in that cold sense. He didn't give up on life.\n- Didn't give up on life. Years later, Mike Tyson apologized to you. What's meaningful to you about that? How does that fit the story? - I wanna be the great\ngracious guy right now. Say, oh, I'm so human that, you know, a man's man enough to say, sorry. That's it. We're good. I wanna be, really, that's the best\npresentation of Teddy Atlas I could put out there. He's a good guy. He forgives. He's a good guy. He's a standup guy and he's\na good guy. I'm not sure. If he truly did it for himself, that he really did it because he felt that it was true. But if he's persuaded by other things, he was in the middle, I\nknow I'm taking it too deep, I know it, but what am I gonna do? He was in the middle of 12\nsteps with the, you know, getting out of drugs, alcohol, 12 steps. Which is a commendable\nthing, really, it is. And he's taking the steps. And part of the steps was to admit all, to apologize to all people\nyou offended in life. Okay. But are you doing it for the 12 steps or are you doing it\nbecause you really truly have come to terms with\nbelieving what you did? Was that hurtful to me? And that it matters to you\nthat it was that hurtful to me. And that you were wrong in doing it. Did you do it for... I know that's deep. I know that I'm a freaking idiot. I'm a, you're a Teddy freaking, you are... You should be better than\nthat. He's better than you. Maybe he is better than me. Maybe he is. Really? Seriously. Maybe he is. And I took it. He put his hand, I took it. We hugged. He said, I love you. I, yeah, yeah. But I wanna believe, but\nwhat did Cus tell me? No matter what a man says, it's what he does in\nthe end that he intended to do all along. So to this day today, was it really genuine or was\nit reflexive of that moment for him to get what he needed\nto, you know, for that step? Or was it truly for what I needed, to really that he really\ncared, that what he did to me, caused me to do what I did, because I did something that\nwas pretty damn bad to him too. Is he able to deal with that and put that where it has to be put? Is he able to put that? Or is it just he did\nsomething he had to do and maybe he's sorry he did it. I know him... Look, I appreciated that he, I would've rather been in a private place. - Yeah. So what people don't know, you were in the middle\nof commentating a fight and he walked up from\nbehind you and he said he was sorry, he shook\nyour hand, gave you a hug. I didn't know he said, I love you. - Yeah. He's emotional. I get\nemotional a little bit too. But he's emotional. And he can be... I can see why people have a fascination and a love affair with him right now. 'Cause he was, because, you know, he was, the meteor, the meteor that went\nacross the sky that is, if they didn't see it, their\nparents told him about it. There was a meteor that\ncame across the sky one day. And the meteor's walking\naround in the room now. And that's the meteorite. And it actually landed here. And that's it right there. And now he's come a long way. And now he's, you know,\nhe's more human and he's lovable, you know, and compassionate. And he cries. And I get the fascinating,\nI get the love affair. I get it. Because we're inherently, we're\npeople that wanna forgive. We're people that... We wanna be good. And part of being good\nis to forgive people and to show compassion to people. And so, and when somebody's been damaged, to acknowledge they've been damaged, to acknowledge that, you know they've been damaged and you care about them being damaged\nand how do you show care? Through admiration, you know, in some ways almost through adulation. And he's getting adulation\nfrom people like, you know, which is to an incredible level, and it's because, it's a phenomena. But I get it. I understand it. And... I don't know if he gets it. I don't know if underneath all of this... He's a complex guy. He's a sensitive guy. I don't know. And I am too. - Yeah. One complex guy talking\nabout another complex guy. - I don't know if underneath it all, where he's really truly at, as far as that day that\nhe said that to me. - Is there part of you\nthat's sorry to Mike, for pulling-\n- I'm not sorry. - Pulling the gun on him?\n- Yeah. And that's, listen, that's fair. I know dimensions of\nhuman nature too well, to not know that he still\nhas to have certain, because I have those strong feelings. What? It's not fair for him to have them? Damn right it's fair. Now, he could look at it, if he was to be held\nto his word that night, that he just acknowledges\nthat what happened he deserved because of what he, you know, the position he put me\nin and he put himself in, what he did? And I wouldn't change nothing. You know? - But still, you don't regret\npulling the gun on him? - I regret that I had to. I regret very much that I had to, that, I regret very much. - He crossed the line. - I hated him for putting\nme in that position, that, you know, how dare he think that somebody's feelings are that trivial, that the\nway I would feel about myself and the way the girl\nwould feel about herself, that was 11 years old at the time, how she would feel about herself. How dare that he think it's that trivial that, you know, that I shouldn't be ready\nto freaking to both die and kill for that. - Why didn't Cus D'Amato\nsee it in a deeper way and talk through it? - He did. The word came back to me. But\nof course, what does it mean? But the word came back to me\nthat Cus said you were right. But if he took the side of Teddy, he would destroy\npotentially a great fighter. - Why do you think that... Okay, if you were to try\nto understand the point he was making, why is that true? Isn't the part of greatness\nthat you said is building the character of knowing what\nis right, what, you know? - Cus was afraid to go there where he used to not be afraid. Because it's kind of\nlike you're never afraid of going up. And I get it, you know,\nwhen I train a fighter now, if I come out of retirement, I train a fighter now, I feel in camp like I'm on death row every day. That if... Every day, I try to\nretrace my memory and say, did I feel this way when I was younger? I don't remember feeling this way. I feel every day a dreadful\nfeeling that if I don't get this right, I betrayed everything. I betrayed the fighter's trust. I betrayed what I'm supposed to be. And then one day I tried to figure it out, why do I feel this way so intense? I was in camp for two months, training a guy for the world title a couple, few years ago, fighting the hardest puncher\nin the world at the time. Adonis Stevenson. And the\nfighter was Ukrainian. And I was, you know, brought in to train him for that fight. And he trusted me, and changed\nhis whole style. Trusted me. Oh my God, I went to bed every night like praying,\ndread, waking up, dread, my stomach down to here, every day saying, what if I fail him? What if everything that I told him was gonna happen don't happen? What if I fail him? What if he trusted me and\nI betrayed that trust? And the thing was, with Cus was, you know, he used to be stronger than that. And then I tried to figure\nit out why I got this way and why it was so dreadful\nto me and why I felt like I was on death row every\nday training a fighter. Like, did I do enough? Did I do right? Will we accomplish what we, will we accomplish what I\npromised him we would accomplish? Would I keep my word? And then I started thinking, well, how did I become this weak? How did I freaking become, I was a pretty strong freaking guy. How did I become this weak? And then finally, I think I\nfigured it out. You know why? Because I was always working to get up. But once I finally got up, now I was looking down\nand it finally hit me. I said, I didn't wanna lose. I said there was nothing\nto lose on my way up. Now all of a sudden, there's something to\nlose when you're up there and you're looking down. - That's where he was. - And that's where Cus was. Cus was at the end of his rope. He accomplished the two world champs. All this stuff, right? Everything. He, and he did it right. Now all of a sudden it\nwasn't about moving forward, it was about not falling down. Holy cow. I was like, I\ngot it, Cus, I got it. I got it. You didn't wanna fall down. Oh my God, you didn't wanna fall. And he, this was his last chance... You don't give up on life. This was his last chance to live forever. To make everything he did worthwhile. To have the youngest... It wasn't just heavyweight\nchamp, you gotta remember, he was the youngest\nheavyweight champ ever. And to have that, it was okay to die now. And how's loyalty to someone\nnamed Teddy Atlas gonna get in the way of that? That's a tidal wave that there ain't no wall\nthat's been made high enough to stop that tidal wave. And now I'll stop myself. Yeah, there is, but it would\nhave to be awful big one. And you know what, who are we to say that we could ever\nbuild that wall that big? Who's any of it? Who am I to say? - Do you think, if you were to put yourself\nin the shoes of Cus, Cus D'Amato, can you see yourself having the big enough wall? Or you would choose loyalty? - Now, if I answer the way I feel, then I'm, you know, I'm making myself John Wayne again. - You don't have to answer that. I think loyalty, loyalty is important. - No matter what a man says, it's what he does in\nthe end that he intends to do all along. I didn't make that up, Cus did. And when this all went down, those words came freaking\nechoing into my freaking ears. I didn't want them. Cotton doesn't help. And they freaking kept\ncoming into my ears. And what do you think,\nstill an immature kid at the time, you know, I was young, still an immature kid at the time, what the freak do you\nthink my response was? You were full of... - Yeah.\n- But I got past that. - Do you forgive Cus? Have you found forgiveness? - Listen, I forgive him\nbecause he gave me more than he took away from me. If I can't, what kind of man am I to, if I can't at least acknowledge that and be grateful for that. He gave me more than he took from me. And I'm grateful for that. I'm also grateful for what I gave him, that I had, you know, that\nI did give him something. And at that point in his life, you know, a place, a place to still, to still have test tubes\nand chemistry experiments. You know? A laboratory where you could\nstill create a great fighter. And I helped give him that. I helped, I was part of\nthat lab and making sure that lab was there and just\nthat there was the existence of test tubes in the place. Because you can't freaking do experiments without test tubes. - Now you're the scientist,\nwith the test tubes. - Yeah. I guess so. And I just hope that, what I said earlier is really, it's really my thread through this whole thing. When you say, can you forgive Cus? I'm still trying to forgive myself. And if I can have hope\nthat I can forgive myself, I think that hope has\nto start with the power to forgive someone else. How can I ever forgive\nmyself for all my failings and figure it out if I\ncan't start and practice it by forgiving someone else\nfor some shortcomings? And for me, that's the only sense of sometimes a very hard thing to make sense of. That's my North Star. That's my compass. Cus used to make me laugh. You know, me and him\ndid everything together and we drive and we get lost in the city. We get lost in the Bronx\nand he'd get all frustrated and he said, \"Atlas,\nyou are a great trainer, but turn you around, you spin you around and you're lost.\" And I said, \"Me or we?\" Because I was the only one\nwho would argue with him. And it was really funny\nsometimes. And I said, we or me? We or... He goes, \"Ah, I don't get...\" \"Cus, you are lost! I'm lost! What are you talking about?\" And then all of a sudden\nCus couldn't give in. He just couldn't admit,\nhe couldn't give in. You know what he said to me,\nall of a sudden, he goes, \"When I was in the army,\nif I had a compass, I could get out of the woods.\" I said, \"We're not in the\nwoods, we're not in the army, we don't have a compass. Cus! Cus!\" \"Just, don't argue with me.\" One time we're driving, I wanna get back to Catskill. We just finished at the Bronx. It's been a long day. You know, visiting the other ring, houses and everything else that he took me through for the 1800-time. And he would fall asleep. You know, he was getting\nolder and he would... And he would just fall asleep in the car. So what do you think?\nI went a little faster. Right? Because before he went to\nsleep, he said, don't speed. So I don't consider myself,\nI try to be an honest guy. I try to be a freaking, but, you know? - It was the fight with six guys. - What did I say earlier?\nTry to do less submitting. - Yeah.\n- Really, in all places. Try to submit a little less. Try to lie a little less\ntoday, a little less. Try to get stronger. Try\nto get a little better. So here we are and we're driving and all of a sudden he's, what did I do? 80, 75? Probably. Probably did,\nyou know, whatever. And all of a sudden he wakes up. \"You were speeding.\" Oh, I lied. \"No, I wasn't.\" \"Don't lie.\" \"I'm not lying.\" \"You lied again. You were speeding.\" Now, come on. This guy,\nhe's, you know what I mean? He's unbelievable. So I gotta freaking, you know, he's David Copperfield. I wanna know the trick. I wanna know how he freaking,\nhe made this thing disappear. So I said, what are you\ntalking, how do you know? He goes, \"'Cause I timed you. I looked at the post\nnumber,\" and I'm like, what? \"I looked at the post number\non the side of the road where we were,\" whatever mile, that. And I never knew they even existed. I look and I said, yeah,\nthere's little numbers. - You start timing and then fell asleep. - Yeah. He timed it and he looked, he goes, \"We couldn't have got from\nhere to there in that amount of time, unless you were\ngoing 75 miles an hour.\" And I'm like, all right.\n- Smart man. - All right. I'm impressed. Don't try to get the mileage. The mile per hour part right. It's enough that you\ngot me. That's enough. I'm... Yeah. I said, and I'm not gonna do that now. I'm, you know, and just, he helped me in crazy ways\nwhere there would be times where I wanted to be, you\nknow, where you wanted to be, whatever. Right? Convenient, weak, submit. Right? And then all of a sudden,\nall of a sudden Cus, in my mind, Cus was\nthere with the stopwatch (laughs) and I'd be like, you know, no. You know, where I was about\nto say yes to whatever that particular situation was. (phone ringing) - Somebody had to call. Hello? Hello. Yes. Doing great. Thank you. Just for the record, never\nhad a phone call like this. It's hotel security. The question is he asked\nme is, \"Are you okay, sir?\" Are you okay? Are we okay? - I think so. I think so so far. - [Lex] Yeah. - You know, I can only go like so far. It's kinda like that old joke, you know, where the guy jumps off\nthe Empire State Building? And he's falling down. And he's\ngoing, you know, 80th floor. 70th floor. 60th floor. 50th. And he gets past the 50th floor and they're looking him\nout the window and he goes, \"How am I doing?\" \"So far so good.\" I don't know where it's gonna end, but... - So Mike Tyson is\nconsidered by many to be one of the great boxers, one\nof the greatest boxers of all time, heavyweight boxers. What do you think on the\npositive side made him great? - I don't know if he was ever great. I know he was sensational. I know he was the greatest\nmix of maybe speed and power ever. I know he was one of the greatest punchers from either side of the\nplate, left or right. There's been great punchers\nwith just the right hand. Like Earnie Shavers and\nDeontay Wilder and Max Baer. I don't know if there's ever been anyone who could punch as good\nas he did on either side with either hand, other than\nJoe Louis and a few others. I don't know if there's\never been such a combination of speed and power to that\npure level that he had. And it was a pure level. I don't know if there was\never as good a fighter as Tyson was for maybe\none night he was great where he wasn't tested, but he might've been ready\nto be tested that one night against Michael Springs. And when he took him apart in 90 seconds, I think I saw a great fighter that night. I don't think you can be\ngreat unless you have all the requirements of being great. - What does it take to be a great fighter? Truly great. - To not rely on someone's\nelse's weakness to be strong. To be strong on your own. Too often he relied on\nother people's weakness, whether it's by being\nintimidated or whether it was because his talent was\nso much greater than theirs that it was like putting\na monster truck in there with a Volkswagen. And the Volkswagen was gonna get crushed. No matter how much horsepower\nthe Volkswagen might've had under the hood and\nyou put under the hood, it was gonna get crushed. The monster truck was not\ngonna allow it to be a contest. And to be able to find a way\nwhen your talent wasn't enough. He didn't find a way when\nhis talent wasn't enough. And I'm not making\nstatements if I'm not ready to put some evidence, you know, like if we were in a courtroom, exhibit A, when he fought Buster Douglas... Buster Douglas matched his will and didn't get intimidated,\nstood up to him. He didn't do what most people did. He didn't submit even a\nlittle bit. Not that night. He had in the past, but\nthat night he didn't. Why? Because Buster had a secret\nweapon that night. His mother. Buster's mother had died\na few months previous. He loved his mother very much.\nBuster had always had talent. Big heavyweight, talented,\ncan punch, technically solid. He was all those things. Always was. But he quit in fights. He did\nless than he should have done. He never lived up to his ability. He gave in, he submitted,\nhe wasn't strong enough. He never had a reason to be strong enough. When his mother died, he had a reason. Nothing could hurt him as much\nas his mother dying hurt him. Mike Tyson included. That night Mike Tyson\ncould not hurt him as much as his mother had hurt him by dying. That night he had a reason\nto be strong for his mother. And he was strong. He was everything he was\nsupposed to be and more. And he stood up to Mike. And Mike for the first time\nmaybe ever was in a fight where he had to overcome something, where he had to be more\nthan talented, more than a puncher, more than a\nguy with scintillating speed. And he wasn't. And then that night got followed by another night with Holyfield. Holyfield wasn't as\ntalented as him, as big, as much a puncher. But Holyfield had the character. He was strong in ways\nthat Tyson wasn't strong. He was strong in a way\nwhere he could find a way. He was willing to find a way. He's willing to go to the cliff, to truly die before he submitted. You know, a lot of stuff is just words. They're gonna have to\ncarry me out on the shield. Yeah, sure, sure. Okay. Yeah. Until it comes time to\nbe carried out on the shield. Sometimes there's people\nthat actually mean it. - [Lex] You think Mike didn't have that? - Well, all right, let's\njust say arbitrarily, I don't have his record on me. Let's say he was 55 and 5. I know he had about 5 losses. All right. Let's say he was 55 and 5. Right? A lot of knockouts. I have a saying, a fight's not a fight until\nthere's something to overcome. Until then it's just\nan athletic exhibition. Contest. Yeah. Who's a better athlete? Who's got more quick twitch fibers? Who's more developed? Who's in better this, who's more developed in\nthose physical areas. But a fight is not a fight until there's\nsomething to overcome. Okay? So if you go by my definition, not\nWebster's, my definition, which I think means something... Mike Tyson was only in\nfive fights in his life. The five fights where there\nwas something to overcome, and he didn't overcome it. Now, I know people hate me\nfor this, including Tyson. I understand. Hate me. Oh, you are a hater. 'Cause you weren't with 'em, you didn't make the money because this, because of that, because you got betrayed. I think I'm better than that.\nI hope I'm better than that. I believe I'm better than\nthat. I'm not a hater. I've broadcast fights for\n25 years on ESPN where there was some people in the\ncorner I did not like. And if they did a good job,\nthis guy's doing a great job. And then there were guys that I liked and I had friendship, he messed up and we\nweren't friends no more. Friendship gotta be tested. Remember that? So we weren't friends no\nmore. But why did I do that? Because it was my job. It\nwas more important for me... When it's all over with, the only thing you are\nleft with is, I mean, we're gonna be dust, all of us, right? The only thing we're left\nwith is what carries on, our reputation, you know,\nlegacy, whatever that is. But our reputation, that's\nall we're left with, and that's all our kids are left with. I want it to be as good as it can be. I've always had a ability, I've done a lot of things wrong and I've\nhad a lot of lackings. But the one strength I've\nhad, if I had a strength, is to understand, somehow,\nthrough osmosis, I guess, to learn the lesson that was important is not what's in front of\nyou for those five seconds, for that moment in life. It's what's left behind\nyou when those five seconds are gone, when that what, whatever it is that you're\ndealing with, you know, whatever the, that moment\nis, whatever, that moment, what you do in that moment, the action of that moment is\ngonna stay with you and be you. It's gonna become you. What you face for that moment... It's gone. It's gone in\nthe air, in an instant. It's gone. It's done. Whether you stand up there\nand you get shot in the head and the guy freaking blows your brains out or you freaking, you stand up, or you're fighting a guy\nwho's like a scary guy to fight, but you fight\nhim and you beat him or he beats you up. But how you represented yourself in that moment is all that matters. That's gonna live... What\nhappened don't matter. It don't matter that you\ngot shot in the head. I know that sounds absurd, but if you believe that it\nwas important to stand up and take the chance to get shot in the freaking head\nrather than to live like an empty vessel, you know what? That's all that freaking matters. And somehow that got freaking wrapped into this freaking head of mine. Like, that's what matters.\nThat's all that matters. You know how many times I went and there were things, whether it was with this\none, with Tyson, with that, I didn't wanna be there,\nI was scared to death, but I was more scared,\nI was more scared... - Living with regret?\n- How I would've felt. - [Lex] Yeah. - I don't wanna be in\nsolitary confinement the rest of my life with that\nfreaking guy in the cell next to me called regret. I don't freaking wanna\nbe next to that guy. If I wanna freaking go down\nthat road, I'll watch Papillon. You know what I mean? And I'll get my fill from that. But I don't wanna freaking live it. I'm afraid of what my\nchildren would think of me if I fail in those areas. Why? Because that's forever. When I'm closing my\neyes for the last time, I don't wanna have that fear. I don't wanna have that fear, you know, whether I'm going down there\nor whether I'm going up there. You know, I laugh because\nI was around guys years ago that used to, when we\ntalk about that, you know, in jest, you know, and I would get a kick out of this one guy who've\nbeen around the block a few times when he say, \"Hey Teddy, I ain't worried about that. I\ngot friends in both places.\" (both laughing) - That's a good line. - And I thought it was good. Listen, Mike Tyson, you want me to say he was a great fighter? Then you want me to betray what I really, you know what I mean? You want me to do that? I ain't doing it for, listen, I could do it to be a bigger Teddy Atlas and I know it would work for me. I know it would be, it'd do\ngreat promotional work for me. I know it would make me more\npopular in certain area. I know it. I'm not that dumb. I'm not that dumb. But I also know what\nelse it would do to me. And I don't want it to do that to me. I think he was a great talent. I think maybe the night\nwith Michael Spinks, maybe the night with Mike, maybe he could've been that fighter. Maybe he could. But he didn't never really get tested. But he might've been ready no matter what, I have to be tested that\nnight. That's how good he was. That's how for, even though\nit was a guy who used to be a light heavyweight, I get it, but was still a guy who beat Larry Holmes, who still had something\nleft, Michael Spinks. So, and a great puncher and an Olympic gold medalist,\nbut, and a special fighter. One of the great light\nheavyweights of all time. You know what Mike Tyson\nwas? He was a meteor. He was a meteor that struck across, and not too many meteors,\nand we still talk about him, and unlike Halley's Comet, he came back and he's walking\naround and he has become greater after his career, more loved, more beloved, more awed. And he's been forgiven. He found the fountain of\nforgiveness. I don't know. I wish I could find that. Where he has been forgotten\nfor all his shortcomings. All the things that he may\nhave done, may not have done. We don't know. Only him and God know. But he's been forgiven of all that. And he's been not only forgiven, he's rised above it and above that and been brought above that, he's been brought to the pyramids of the greatest athletes\nthat, in the world. And in every way. In every way, as a person, as a fighter, as a historian, as a\nfigure, as a celebrity. I mean-\n- As even a philosopher. - Everything. So I will take it back. All right? All you guys out there, you forgive me? He's the greatest of all time if you encapsulate all that, if you encapsulate everything\nI just tried to describe and explain, if you put that all, he's the greatest of all time. Yeah, he is. But he still might be 0-5. In a record of 55 fights, he might, in Teddy Atlas's book, again,\nI got friends in both places. So it's okay, wherever\nI go, I have company, somebody there will like\nme, despite me saying this, he might be 0-5 because\nof 5 fights where there was something to overcome,\nwhich really defines a fight. He came, he didn't find a way. - Let me ask Teddy Atlas to introspect on the human nature here. As part of the complexities\nof your feelings on this whole thing is that\nyou know, to some degree, that if you were coaching Mike Tyson, he could be truly great? - I know, I'm gonna cut you\nright off because you asked a million dollar question. I wish you didn't, but you did. You did. 'Cause that's why...\n- When do I get paid? - That's why you get paid. I get it. You took the\nwords outta my mouth. That's why you are where you are. And that's why I'm here. - [Lex] (laughs) The humility. - I'm going to, again, full disclosure, it's important, right? I'm gonna cheat, I'm gonna\ntake some of Cus's wisdom. All right? A little bit of mine. Cus told somebody that if\nTeddy Atlas got his way, he might've been a better person, but we would've risked him\nnot being a great fighter. Now, I believe, and I thought Cus did, and I think he did up to\nthat point in his life, that part of your strength\nof character made you a great fighter, and\ntruly a great fighter. And part of that battle\nto be a better person, that fight, if you will,\nto be a better person, to overcome the things,\nto be a better person, part of that fire you\nhave to go through to be a better person. I really truly bought into\nit. And I'm in for life. That is really the only\nway to be a great fighter. And I don't think that's what Cus meant. I thought he meant, I think he meant that\nCus knew more than I did of what was about to\ncome and what would come and what the world was. How people would try to steal him, how people would take him, and how people would steal his guy. The last thing he had, the really, the thing that he lived for, 'cause he lived to have\nanother heavyweight champ, the greatest fighter ever, Cus, in Cus's mind, he could be. And I believe that Cus knew that he could put forward a guy that had the ability to be the greatest fighter ever, without fully completing\nthe mission of what it takes to really be great, but that he wouldn't be\naround to have to witness it. And that he wouldn't, he was\nwilling, he would, oh man, this is awful. He's willing to concede that\nhe might be dead in order to have eternal life, in\norder to have greatness. And which Cus does have greatness. And part of that greatness\nis attached to Tyson. And he deserves it. He deserves\nit, Cus was a great man. And I wouldn't be here partly without him. - But that was part of the calculation. - I know that's deep and\nI know that's, oh God, I hate myself right now. But Cus, he knew he was getting out free. He knew he was gonna not have to be there. He was getting off easy. Oh, Teddy, how do you say\nsomeone's gonna be dead, they're getting off easy? Well, I'll say it again in case you didn't hear me, all right? He was gonna get off\neasy and not have to face where he came up short. Because he did his job. 'Cause he put forward the\ngreatest fight of all time and you guys screwed it up. And he knew that that might happen. But you guys screwed it up. And whatever. That's your fault. That's on... I'll tell you, Tyson will be mad at this, but that's on Tyson. How can you say that, Teddy, he loved me. I'm not saying he didn't\nlove you, but he loved him. He loved some other stuff too. And I don't know if Tyson could ever come to grips like with that. And it's not his job to. But it's my job not to hide from it. I know Cus mentions that other people just only think they know. - Did Cus know? Did Cus know this about\nhimself? Did he reflect? Did he introspect? - Well, he sent the message to me. Cus sent a guy to me.\nMy wife was pregnant. We were living in an apartment in Catskill on Coe Hill Road. We went through all this. And I was getting ready to move to Staten Island, and we\nstill were there for a little while before we did. You know, after all this went down. He sent a guy to me, to the house, secret, whatever you wanna call it. My wife, me. So, I listened to him. Cus said, if you leave, I'm a messenger, you know,\nwhatever, if you leave, this was in a aftermath of\nwhat, the gun, the whole thing. You gotta remember Tyson\nwas a ward of the state. He was put in Cus's custody.\nCus was looking to adopt him. For obvious reasons. So he\nhad control, and he loved him. How dare I say anything less? I won't. But it made sense too. But he\nwas a ward of the state still. Do you know what that\nmeans? There's rules. It means the state's still overlooking it. If he ain't living the\nright life, you know, you gotta remember he came out, you know, he came out of a jail. So reform school. But if he ain't living the life, he could be taken away from Cus. What's not living the right life? Well, he wasn't in school no more. They didn't know about it. He had some things that were going on. We won't get into that right now, in school and different things, whatever. And he had his trainer\nput a gun to his head. That ain't so good. If a report came back to\nthem that that happened, he would've been taken away from Cus. That couldn't happen. Nobody knows this. I talk about it a little\nbit, but never probably, because why would I, I don't know. Why am I doing it now? I don't\nknow because I don't know. Because I am, because it's now, because it's now maybe, maybe because it's now, I don't know. So he sent this man that, you\nknow, obviously we both knew, and he said, here's the deal, Teddy, no talk about this, wants\nit to, you know, disappear, basically, you leave and he\nwill give you 5%, his word, can you imagine? He will give you 5% of\nTyson's earnings for the rest of his career. But I don't regret it one\nbit 'cause it wouldn't have happened anyway. See that's where I could be honest with my, people say, oh, stand up guy. Because I told him to shove\nit with the, you know, in that place, and tell Cus\nshove it in that freaking place. You know, I was mad. Teddy,\nTeddy, don't get angry. Don't get angry? Are you outta? You serious? Get outta here. Tell\n'em to go shove it over. And you know, my wife was like, huh. But, and then people like after, \"Why didn't you take the deal?\" It wasn't a deal. It was an escape clause for Cus, it was an insurance\npolicy that his, you know, that this kid wouldn't\nbe taken away from him. And thank God he wasn't, I\nwasn't gonna go and say nothing. They didn't have to worry\nabout, Cus forgot who I was? Cus forgot why he went to court for me? Because of those characteristics\nthat he said he loved and he noticed and that he admired? I didn't lose those... He\nforgot that that was me? He forgot who he was talking to? He didn't have to do that. How about that's why I told\nhim to shove it up his... Not because of the other insult. and then when people said to me, \"Oh, you a stand up,\" because\nit was around a little bit. It was around in the circles. And then when people,\noh, oh, stand up Teddy, he didn't care about the money. I said, stand up Teddy?\nWhat are you talking about? How about just realistic Teddy, how about I live in a real world that I was never gonna get that money. So I'm saying, I'm\nstanding up to something that I knew never existed. So I ain't stand up. Not in that way. I am in other ways maybe, but not, don't put a medal on my chest for that. Because that never existed. It was never meant to exist.\nBut he didn't even understand. That was the one thing that\nreally disappointed me in Cus. I was like, Cus, you really\nallowed this to get to you. Where you allowed it to\nreally fog up your thinking to the point where\nyou're smarter than that, you're better than that. That you would actually think\nyou gotta freaking offer me a freaking pieces of silver? You really think that? That's what you... Freak you! Like all that you told me that you love me and that we were, I was the young master and all this and you think you were gonna buy me? And I was gonna, and that\nwas gonna keep me quiet? How about I would keep quiet because I would always keep quiet. - So he thought maybe\nyou might betray him. - Isn't that interesting? Yeah. And why did he think that? No, no, really. - Fear.\n- Yeah. But yeah, fear is at the\nessence of everything, it is connected with everything. Fear of losing what he was gonna lose. But it was more than fear. It was him not believing in\nthe things that he told me he believed in. He didn't even know that. He believed in me because\nI was a stand up guy. because I didn't sell\nmyself, because I, you know, I didn't freaking turn\nevidence. I didn't make a deal. I didn't do... And that's why he went to court and that's why he stood up\nfor me and I appreciate it. And that was what he lived by and that was his, you know, those were the blocks of being a man. Oh, so much for those blocks. - Well it's like you said,\nloyalty requires, you know, he would've had to take a\nrisk on losing immortality that he would achieve by creating a great heavyweight champion. - 100%. But the only way you\never find out if somebody is really that... - It's hard, it's hard.\n- Is the test. And it was Cus. - This is Shakespearean. You know? This story. - Cus told me, Cus said, \"And it just come in different forms.\" I said, all right, Cus.\n- This was his test. - \"And some people pass this\ntest because they're able to pass that test because\nit's not really a test. Not for them because it doesn't\nspeak to their weakness. But it's the test that\nspeaks to the weakness. That's the one.\" So this one, I get it. I get what it spoke to, Cus. You know what, at the end of the day, I forgive you and I feel bad for you. I feel bad that you were put in that position after you\nlived your life that way. And that you taught that and you preached that from the mountaintops. That you had to be... That you had to be... I'm not gonna use the word, but that you had to fail\nyourself and that you had to somehow know that before you died. I just prayed that you didn't know that. And you still don't know\nthat because you were great. You were great. And you've given me some, you know, you've given me\nsomething to aspire towards, to try to be less weak, try to be better and try to be as good as you want it to be. I wish I can someday. More importantly, I wish I could make my father, you know, feel, just feel good up there."

      "text": "- You're a grandfather now. - Yeah. Four grandchildren. - What, if you can give\nhim advice on how to live a life they can be proud of? - Just... Do everything you can to the best of your ability every day. To like yourself. To\ngive yourself a reason. To actually say, I'd like\nto be friends with that guy. - Is loyalty one of the reasons, one of the things to aspire to? - Loyalty is your chance\nto have a fulfilled life. Loyalty is your chance to have strength, to have all the things you\nneed to have a good life, to be a good parent, be a good husband, be a good grandfather,\nhopefully be a good role model. Loyalty is... Loyalty is, if you could\nfind something to drink, to take into your body to\nmake you prepared for life, to be all the things that you wanna be, to be strong enough to be those things, loyalty would be the\nthing you would drink. And when I say loyal,\nI mean unequivocally. I mean, you know,\nunconditionally, not conveniently, obviously you know that. If you could be loyal, you\ncould be a good person, you could be a person that\nyou would actually like to be around. 'Cause you could be a\nperson you could rely on. And I think that's one\nof the greatest assets that a human being can have. - And what do you do when you're betrayed? How do you overcome that? - You think of what you learned from it. Use it as a roadmap to remember, and to think back of how you got there. And how you got to the\nplace where you got betrayed and how that person got to that place. Try to remember that in your own journey. - Has it, for you, made you cynical? Like how do you try, how do you take the leap of\ntrust towards people again and again after that? - Just by remembering\nthat I'm still trying to forgive myself for the things\nthat I came up short with. And if I haven't figured that out yet, it's probably okay to say they didn't figure it out yet. They didn't get it, they\ndidn't figure it out. And if I couldn't figure it out, and I'm still trying to figure out, maybe I could get over\nthat initial stabbing of what it feels like,\nit does feel kind of like a stabbing, that you feel when you're betrayed initially, and that you can only think\nof anger, revenge, hatred, and those things I'm not proud of that, but I felt all those things, you know, and I still feel 'em sometimes. And then I go back and say, hey, you're still working at forgiving\nyourself for some things. Try to remember that kid, you know, memory's an important thing. Forgetfulness is pretty important too. And try to remember why we forget. (laughs) Why do we forget? Because it wasn't something\nyou felt proud of. - You think about your death? Are you afraid of it? - You know, it's funny you asked that. I never used to think about it. I know people in both places, you know? - I know. You've got it covered. (laughs) You're gonna be all right. - Don't forget that.\n- Yeah. - I know people in both places. - Yeah.\n(both laughing) Both neighborhoods. - I... I've been given credit for being brave in certain spots in life. I hope I can be brave when it comes time to leave life. I hope I can be. You know, and that's, you know, that's as real and honest\nas you can be about it. I hope I can be, you know,\nso far so good. You know? When I've had to be certain\nthings that were scared to freaking death, I\nfound a way to beat them, for the most part. And so I figured when that day comes, I'll figure that out too. - [Lex] It's gonna be another test. Maybe the last one. Teddy, it's a huge honor to talk to you. - It's my pleasure. - Thank you for being the human you are. For being honest, honest about the full\nrange of human nature. And thank you for talking today. - Thank you. Thank you for having me,\nand thanks for listening. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Teddy Atlas.

He didn't want to, damn\nright he didn't want to, but he knew we want him to. And he knew in order to pass\nthe test, he had to do it. He goes, now it's gonna\nbe your job to get him in the gym, make him mentally stronger, make him face things, and teach him how to slip\npunches and create holes, and fill those freaking holes\nwith devastating punches, this is Cus, with punches\nwith bad intentions. - The following is a\nconversation with Teddy Atlas, a legendary and at times\ncontroversial boxing trainer and commentator. When I was going to this\nconversation with Teddy, I was ready to talk boxing: styles,\nmatches, techniques, tactics, and his analysis of individual fighters like\nMike Tyson, Michael Moore, Klychko, Usik, Povetkin,\nLomachenko, \"Triple G\", Canelo, Muhammad Ali, \"Sugar\" Ray Leonard, Hagler, Duran, Floyd,\nand on and on and on. Like I said, I came ready to talk boxing, but I stayed for something even bigger, the Shakespearean human\nstory of Teddy Atlas, Cus D'Amato and Mike Tyson. It's a story about loyalty,\nbetrayal, fear, and greatness. It's a story where nobody is\nperfect and everybody is human. To summarize, in the early '80s, young trainer Teddy Atlas worked with his mentor Cus D'Amato in training the young boxing protege, now\na boxing legend, Mike Tyson. Mike was a troubled youth,\narrested over 40 times, and at age 15, he was\nsexually inappropriate with Teddy's 11-year-old niece. In response to this, Teddy put a .38 caliber\nhandgun to Tyson's ear and told him to never\ntouch his family again, or he would kill him if he did. For this, Cus D'Amato\nkicked Teddy out. Why? Well, that's complicated. In part, I think, to\nhelp minimize the chance of Mike Tyson, who Cus legally adopted, will be taken away by the\nstate and with him the dream of developing one of the\ngreatest boxers of all time. Of course, that summary doesn't capture the full complexity of human nature and human drama involved here. For that, you have to\nlisten to this conversation, the things said, and\nthe things left unsaid, the pain in Teddy's voice, the contradictions of love and anger that permeate his stories\nand his philosophy on life. Like I said, I came to talk\nabout boxing and stayed to talk about life. This conversation will stay\nwith me for a long time. The people close to you,\nthe people you trust, the people you love are everything. And if they betray you and\nbreak your heart, forgive them. Forgive yourself and try again. Happy holidays everyone. I love you all. This is a Lex Fridman\npodcast, to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Teddy Atlas. You wrote in the book that your father had a big influence on your life. What lessons have you learned\nabout life from your father? - When you ask that question, you know, I remember Cus D'Amato\nwhen I was with him up in Catskill for all those years, and he used to say to me, \"Teddy, you learn through osmosis.\" I'd believe there's true to\nthat if I know what osmosis is. And I-\n(both laughing) but it sounds good.\n- Yeah. - But I learned through\nosmosis with my father. He wasn't a big talker. He\nwas, you know, he was a doer. And when you're around someone who lives a certain kinda life and does\ncertain things, it penetrates. - He was a doctor?\n- He was, I'm gonna sound like an idiot\nright now because I'm being a son, but he was the\ngreatest diagnostic doctor... I mean, if I say I ever\nknew, what's that mean? - Yeah.\n- You know what I mean? Are you a doctor? You know what I mean? Like, what does that mean? But other people have told me this. - Yeah.\n- Like just legendary stories. - He would do house calls\nand he'd help people. And like you said, a lot of people have spoken\nabout the impact he's had on their life. - He built two hospitals\nand he built those hospitals before any of us had a bridge in New York, connecting Brooklyn to Staten Island. And he built it so people could get proper hospital care that couldn't afford it, period. And everybody looked at him as eccentric. - Yeah. Nice.\n- Yeah, because he would literally sneak patients, not sneak 'em in, he was Dr. Atlas, he could do what he wanted\nto a certain extent, but he would bring patients in without administering,\nputting through administration. So there was no charge because, you know, they didn't have anything. They were street people. I remember being, my only way to be with my\nfather was to go on house calls. Or to go to the office.\nThere's no, you know? And so I went on house calls with him. And he did house calls, by the way, till he was 80, and $3. I mean, it was better\nthan like McDonald's, you know what I mean? I mean, the deal, $3 and you got medicine, you got everything. But he used to, right around the holidays, there was just certain things\nthat I didn't understand, but I understood later where we would just drive\ncertain areas and he just all of a sudden opened his door, he would pick up these\nhomeless and, you know- - Help 'em.\n- I'm 10 years old. You know, move over and\nmove over, you know? - And it's just you,\nhim and a homeless guy? - A couple.\n- A couple. - Yeah. Whatever he could fit in. Three, four. You know, whatever it was. - That's a big heart. - And then he took 'em to the\nhospital, dropped him off. So, you know, I would ask\nquestions after it was all over with, I'd say, \"Dad, they're sick?\" He goes, \"Well, not in the way where you put them in the hospital.\" So he said, yeah. And he tried to explain\nthings to me, you know, he would try... He didn't talk much unless\nyou ask him something. And that kind of works. And you know, don't talk unless\nsomeone asks you something. And he explained to me that, I said, well, \"Why are you putting 'em\nin the hospital then?\" You know, and of course the sickness was, they were alcoholics, but\nwhy are you putting 'em? It wasn't an alcohol rehab, you know, so why are you putting, and it wasn't for the purpose to dry out. He wasn't trying to cure them. Let's put that before we\nanoint him for sainthood. You know, like by Teddy Atlas. So I was like, we\nfinally get to the point, why you put him in there? Well, because it's the\nholidays. All right. Why you put him in there? Well, the holidays, you know, are good for certain\npeople and bad for others. And it was always before the holidays. It was before Christmas,\nbefore... Whatever. And New Year's, whatever.\nAnd so I said, \"Why?\" And he said, \"Because they\nremind people, certain people, of what they don't have.\" That other people enjoy the holidays because of what they have:\nfamily, you know, whatever. And it reminds them they're minus that. - That's pretty profound.\n- Yeah. And then, and I don't\nremember because he didn't use the word suicide, but I got it. Like he basically, I forget\nhow he said it, but like, I just got it. I don't know how I got,\nI suppose, I don't know. But I just got it like, so\nthey don't hurt themselves. That's what came across.\n- In every way. - I don't think he ever articulated that, ever verbalized that. But yeah. They don't hurt themselves. So, and well, how does that work? Well, just, basically they're\ngonna be around people. They're not gonna be alone.\nThey're gonna be around people. They're gonna get fed,\nthey're gonna be warm. Right? And it's gonna be for three\ndays, two-three days, whatever. And basically, it's a bridge. So the funny thing as a 10-year-old, I want to be connected to him. So I've enlisted myself in the job. When he used to drop them\noff, he would take them, get 'em in. Right? And then the thing that I know, again, he didn't say nothing. But you notice things,\nand, if you care enough, you don't notice nothing\nif you don't care. But if you care and if\nit's important, you notice. And this guy was important to me. I just was, I didn't know\nwhat a hero was. No clue. I loved Mickey Mantle. I love Willie Mays. I loved Muhammad Ali. I never, ever connected them\nin my mind as heroes. Never. My father. I didn't connect it that way. But he-\n- Looking back now... - Looking back, he was my\nfirst connection to a hero. - The two of you ever talk about how much you love each other? The word love... - The one thing that was not allowed. The greatest memory I have,\nmy father showing me love was, we were down in Florida at an airport. And we were, I was born in Miami. Don't ask where, I was passing through. And the rest of my\nfamily's born in New York. Staten Island. And so I was supposed\nto go back with, right? And I wanted to stay with my\nmother for whatever reason. And so he, you know, of\ncourse, conceded to it. And he's, okay. You know, whatever. And very quiet. Very... And there's a man who never\nshowed emotion to anyone. I mean, for the most, you know? Really. All of a sudden he just\nturned and kissed me on the forehead and left. And I was like, that's different. - Yeah. You still remember that, huh? - Yeah. Like, that's weird. - You lost him 30 years ago? How did that change you? - It made me realize that\nsome of the deals I used to make for God weren't realistic. When I was a kid, I used\nto make deals with God, let me die before my father. And then, you know, you get older and you\nhave kids, you're blessed. Why did you make that\ndeal? You know what I mean? Like, (laughs) thank you\nfor not taking me up on it. - Yeah, yeah.\n- Thanks. - [Lex] Yeah. (laughs) - You know?\n- Oh, yeah. You miss him? - I miss him in moments\nwhen I'd like to know what to do, and, you know, I remember when I would drive with him on the house calls, he\ndidn't listen to music. He was a guy, he read books\nto his, when he got older, he read books till blood\nvessels broke in his eyes. He only read nonfiction books. Science. He loved science. Wars. Generals. I mean, I cheated on a couple book reports because I didn't do\nthe reading of the book the night before, I had\na freaking, a book report to put in, \"Dad. I got a book report to do\non the war of Stalingrad.\" - Yeah.\n- Really. The war of Stalingrad. And who the freak could\ntell you where you get an A? I got an A. - Yeah. - I just wrote what he told me. He told me generals. He told me times. He told me strategy. He told me about the winter that came\nand destroyed the Germans. And the Soviets were tougher than- - You got an A?\n- And he told Soviets were tougher than the Germans. And, you know, the Germans\npicked on the wrong opponent. - Yeah.\n- I was already in the boxing business.\n- Yeah. - I didn't even know it.\n- Yeah. (laughs) - I didn't even know it.\n- Yeah. - Matchmaking, very important.\n- Yeah. - They mismatched. They made a mistake with\nthe picking the opponent. And so when we would\nbe driving in the car, my father would be in a trance. And, dad, he wasn't ignoring me, at all. He was just with his\nthoughts. He was wherever. He wasn't even hearing the radio no more. I always wonder where he was. I did. So I asked him one day. And just so we're driving,\nI said, I wanna know. So I said, \"Dad, what do you think when you're\nbasically in this place that I know you're somewhere?\" Where are you, what are you seeing? I actually said, \"What do you see?\" And he said to me, \"I see what could be. I see what could be.\" And I'm like, oh, all right. - I gotta ask you, when\ndid you discover boxing? When did you first fall\nin love with boxing? - When it saved me. - How did it save you? - I was a stupid, violent\nkid that was angry, not exactly knowing why I was angry. I'd fit in real good in today's society. Because there's a lot\nof angry kids out there that I don't think they\nknow why they're angry. I was just out there\ngetting in fights and I got this stupid thing from that. - Can you tell the story\nof how you got that? - I was just running around\ndoing stupid things, bad things. I hurt people, some people\nphysically, but I hurt my family. You know, that's BS,\nyou only hurt yourself. You know, that's a good way\nof, you know, alibiing it. You know? But if at some point the\ntruth usually finds its way... I'd like it to look like\nI was just hurting myself, but it wasn't, obviously. So I was just out on the streets with kids that didn't grow up in the\nneighborhood I grew up. I grew up in a neighborhood\nwhere a father was a doctor, and I walked down the street... The funny thing was, down the hill was a very tough neighborhood\ncalled Stapleton. And most of the people down there on the corners wish that\nthey could get up the hill. And I wished I could get down the hill. So I went down the hill, and I hung out with all these friends that became lifelong friends. And I gravitated to that because I... I figured out later a little bit. But, you know, I wanted family.\nWe were a disjointed family. We were, you know, my father was a doctor. He didn't have time for nothing but being a doctor, you know, I think when you're great at something, you sacrifice something too. You know, when you're\nreally great at something, so great that maybe God made you great and you're too great for your own good. And I don't know, it took me to these\nstupid, dangerous places. Dangerous for me, but\ndangerous for other people too. Because I got to the point\nwhere I was doing robberies on the street. I was fighting everybody. And you know what the most\ndangerous part about it was? And I came to this realization\non my own. All by myself. I figured out. I was really as dangerous, you know, these kids from the projects,\nsome of 'em, they got nothing. First of all, I learned you don't have\nto be poor to be poor. You don't have to be\ndeprived of certain things to be deprived. And, because you... At least\nto think you're deprived. And I was poor in a way that\nI didn't have the only thing I wanted to have, him. So here I am where I'm out\nthere doing these things. And what made me more, I was more dangerous than\nsome of these psychopaths. Well, I was a psychopath too, I guess, the way I was behaving. But some of these psychopaths\nthat really had nothing, you know, really would, you know, they obviously would kill you. I was dangerous almost in the same way, but for a different reason. I know it's ridiculous\nwhat I'm about to tell you, but I figured it out. 'Cause I felt it. I thought I was on a righteous path. I thought I had a right... Because it was gonna\nget me my father back. Why? Why? I mean, you know, you're a scientist, you couldn't figure this one out, because all the people that had him were injured\npeople, fractured people, screwed up people in some ways. But hurt, damaged people. So if I get damaged, I'll get him. So I was on a crusade, really a righteous crusade\nwhere I thought it was okay. I had permission. I had permission to do these\nterrible things, quite frankly. And to fight everyone. And I did. And then it came almost to a crash of doing all that, you know, winding up in Rikers Island, like an idiot. Not understanding the damage I did to this poor man that, you know, he was a great doctor and\nhe's gotta see his son and hear about, you know what I mean? Like, God, I was out\non that day, you know, with the guys that I grew\nup with now, you know, the guys from the projects\nfrom the, as I described, and I was with one of\n'em who, he's dead now. So I was with him and we were in a neighborhood, the\nneighborhood we grew up that I hung out and then, and he grew up in, Billy,\nhe came from the projects. And we got into a thing where somebody cut us\noff, we cut them off, you know, jumped out to fight. And, you know, it turned\nout there's like five or six of them and two of us. And we fought, you know, right on the side right there, only about a block from where\nI used to hang out and maybe a block and a half. And right in front of\nlike a Spanish bodega. And it really does happen in slow motion. I actually saw the guy, I was fighting the guys\nthat I had to fight, and then all of a sudden I\nwas able to get one guy out of the way a little bit. And I really, I noticed\nthe guy go into his pocket, and I knew why he was going\nin his pocket, you know? And when he came outta his pocket, I knew what it was right away. It was weird because in\nthe neighborhood guys used to hang out, they were\ninto this, you know, they get into fights like\nright on the streets. And they went to, at that time, they went into this cheap knife. But it was, they thought it was, well, we thought it was cool. It was a 007. And the cool thing, whatever, was that you could flick\nit, you could learn, and I learned how to flick, you know, but I never carried a knife. But when my friends would\nhave it, I would just, you learn how to, you could flick it open, not a switchblade, but\nflick it with your wrist. And I was like, here I am in the middle\nof this fricking fight. And all of a sudden, oh,\nthat's a 007, you know? And so I'm like, you gotta\nmake a decision, you know? And I got a split... I can either not do nothing, which wasn't, didn't seem\nlike a great, you know, a great option. I couldn't run away. - Why not? - 'Cause you gotta live\nwith yourself afterwards. And that's more difficult to\nlive with than whatever it is at that second, because\nthat don't go away away. - You couldn't live with\nyourself running away. - It's just don't go away. That thing, nothing to\ndo with being brave. It has nothing to do\nwith being brave, really. It's got to do with just\ncommon sense in life, that for me, whatever you're\ndealing with, it's over. It's done. Like okay, deal with it. Go to bed, whatever. But you do that, you\nknow that other thing. You gone, that never ends. This thing ends. - Memory of you being, let's say, a coward in that moment, that never ends. - The only thing I had\nat that point in my life, in my stupid mind, was a reputation. That I would stand up to certain things, that was like, and that for me was worth something, whatever. Because I didn't feel any\nworth to anything else. That was the only thing I\nfelt a connection of worth to. So... - [Lex] So you stood\nyour ground and got cut? - So I say, no. I made a decision. - Yes.\n- I stood my ground. But I actually, things\ndo slow down. They do. And I actually said it's 007, he's gonna flick it, and I didn't say, but he's gonna flick it. I get a split second, either, like I said, either I do nothing, whatever. Or I get to him before he gets it flicked. I went to get to it\nbefore he got it flicked. and I just as I got close\nto, I did him a favor. I walked right into a counter punch because I cooperated with him, I went right to him and just as I... He practiced more than I did\nwith the 007, apparently. Because he was like, boom boom, boom boom. And, anyway... - What did you think? What did you think that happened?\nThat was all slow motion. Did you think you might die? - Yeah. Well, not immediately. Took me a minute. I'm a slow learner. I put my hand up. Right? Wouldn't you? I guess so. And it went into my face. And that was it. It was gooey. It was warm and gooey. And I was like, I don't\nknow what this means, but I don't wanna know. But I think I know. And... And... - Did you think about\nyour dad, in that moment? - No. You know what I thought about it was, you don't know who anyone\nis until they're tested. And I learned that. Cus used to tell me, but I learned it. He used say, I remember one time Cus, I was a 17, 18-year-old\nkid up there and, you know, thought I was whatever I thought I was. And he said, \"You got a lot of friends?\" And I said, \"Yeah.\" 'Cause you know, I was\non the street hanging out with 100 kids at night,\nsometimes, on the street corner. So I was like, I don't know too many people\nthat hung out with 100 kids on the street, on a corner,\non a Friday, Saturday night. And I was like, \"Yeah,\nI got a lot of friends.\" He goes, \"Really?\" \"Yeah, really.\" He said, \"How about if I\ntold you might not have any, most likely you don't have any.\" And he goes, and then he\njust started this thing. He said, \"Everyone's gonna\nbe tested. You, me, everyone. 'Cause you don't know about\nnobody until they're tested.\" He goes, \"You know nothing.\" He goes, \"You know nothing until you know, until something happens to test if they were really a friend.\" And he told me this story about a guy, a guy came to him and he was upset. \"What are you upset about?\" He goes, \"I'm upset because\nI just lost a friend.\" You know, \"After 20 years of friendship, we're not friends no more.\" So coach looks at him, he goes,\n\"Let me ask you a question. What made you think you\nwere ever friends with him?\" Now the guy gets insulted,\nthe guy's, \"Did you hear me?\" He goes, \"I just told you\n20 years I've been friends with this guy. Why would you say that to me?\" He said, \"Well, I say it again. What makes you think he was your friend?\" He goes, \"Whatever happened\nin the 20 years other than chasing girls?\" 'Cause Cus figured that one out fast. \"Chasing girls and drinking\ntogether and whatever else you're doing out on the street. Whatever gave you the inclination\nthat he was a friend?\" He goes, \"Whatever,\nwhen did he risk himself to be your friend? When was it dangerous to be your friend?\" - [Lex] When was the friendship tested? - When was it uncomfortable\nto be your friend? And you know what the guy\nsaid? You can figure it out. You're a scientist. He said... He said, \"Today.\"\n- Yeah. - And today came for me. And today, today, today, today,\nkept coming for me, today. And that day, my friend\nBilly had turned out, while I was fighting these\nwhatever, five, six guys. And where was Billy? He was on the roof. He was on the roof. He was on the roof. He was my best friend. And so anyway, they\ntake me to the hospital. And here's the thing with my father. But one thing Billy did\ndo for me when he got off the roof, thank God,\nhe did, he dragged me, dragged me into this\nbodega, laid me on the floor and started putting towels. Right? And the towels,\nI vaguely remember this. They filled up with blood. I mean, completely, like drenched, like you put 'em under a shower. And I heard the bodega owner screaming, screaming, you know, like, (imitates screaming) you know, whatever. And everyone's screaming\nand there's chaos. And I'm like, I don't know. I'm calm. Weird. I'm like real calm. And I'm just in this place, where things are calm. (laughs) And all of a sudden\nI hear Billy, he's screaming, \"Call the ambulance,\" call the, (imitates screaming) you know, and nobody's doing nothing. Everyone's frozen. I'm starting to understand already, people get frozen in situations. People... The fear... Fear, fear, fear, fear,\njust paralyzes people. And I was going into a fear business. I was learning, I was learning, I was getting, learning, early PhD. - In fear?\n- Yeah. And all of a sudden,\ngenius, Billy, genius, really, street kid.\n- Yeah. - He jumps up on a freaking counter, jumps over the counter,\ngrabs the phone, calls 911, says a cop's been shot. And forget about it. It was crazy. All I remember after that, I'll tell you the couple\nthings I remember, lights, being put onto a stretcher, bounced around, you know, rushed. I felt everyone's anxiety,\nexcept mine. I had none. But I felt everyone's\nanxiety, everyone's fear, like it was all around me. It was like, wow, this is interesting. It's kind of, I know that's\nstupid, but like, well, this is interesting. - You really have an eye for fear. That's fascinating.\nYou're really studying it. - Well I had no choice. I got introduced in the crash course, and they put me in ambulance. And this is what I\nremember, to your point, I'm sorry it took so\nlong to get to it, I am, although I'll probably do it again before this conversation's over, but I- - It's all about the journey.\n- Yeah. We'll get there. We'll get there, pops. So I hear the cops say,\n\"We might lose him.\" And I'm like laughing to myself. I'm not laughing because I'm not, again, I'm not John Wayne, John\nWayne would've laughed, but I'm like, lose? You guys are stupid. You know, I didn't say\nthat, but I'm like, lose me? My father's the greatest\ndoctor in the freaking world. There's nothing to worry about. You people, all you people are all uptight and whacked out here with\nfear and there's nothing to worry about. Dr. Atlas is my father. So anyway, so they're taking\nme to the, and they said, \"We don't have time.\" I hear a couple things I\nremember, \"Don't have time, take 'em to,\" and they take me to the US Public Health Hospital, Marine Hospital it was called at the time, but US Public Health. And it's in Stapleton,\nso it's close, thank God. So they're taking me and I hear them on the radio, you know, saying this stuff about we\ngotta move, we gotta move. And I start talking. And they're telling me don't talk. And I like to talk a lot, you\nknow, and I'm so, again, fear. There's no fear when\nthe fear's been removed. It's the only time you're\nreally free in life. And I know that sounds\nabsurd, but really, it is. It's the only time you're\nreally free in life. I was, when you-\n- Close to death? - When you're devoid of things that normally hold you back,\nthat normally influence you, in ways, that, you know, that\nare not of the influence, that always positive influence, where you are in a pure place, where you're in a purely free place from all inhibitions, from\nfear, from anxiety, from joy. Joy can screw you up. And you're\nfree from all these things. And I'm in this place, - In the back of an ambulance you're free. - I'm, yeah, I'm like, I said, \"Just get me Dr. Atlas.\" And they say, \"We don't have time.\" No, no, no, no, no. You don't... You have to get Dr. Atlas.\nYou have to get him. This was the... Dammit. This was the... You know what I mean? I finally freaking hit the\nnumber and I'm not getting paid. And then all of a sudden I'm out. - How many stitches- - Well, I think it was 400, 200 inside, 200 outside or whatever it was. - It's a lot.\n- Hey, look, after 50, the number doesn't matter no more. Right? Whatever, 60, 70,\n80, 90, whatever, you know? So I was fortunate. I was fortunate. And of course they, I was fortunate, they told me afterwards, that he missed my jugular\nliterally by like a centimeter. I mean, whatever. And so then we wouldn't be having this conversation, obviously. - Well, I'm glad you made it.\n- Yeah. I'm kind of glad too. And it just missed my\neye, which, thank God. It's bad enough, have a scar,\nimagine me with a patch? I mean, it's enough that\nI got this freaking thing. And look, it goes all the\nway, you know, I mean it's, you know, it's pretty long. And... I don't know. I was out and then\nsomehow I sensed like they had the curtain closed, you know? And it's amazing how vivid this is. And the curtain's closed\nand I see a shadow. I felt a presence. I did. And I felt him. He's a powerful guy. And I felt him. And I just\nsee like a shadow, you know? And all of a sudden the\ncurtain gets pushed back, and I can't really see,\nit's dark and I'm, you know, out of it, but not completely out of it. And pushes the curtain back, comes in, and his hands, even though it's all\nbandaged, you know, whatever. But his hand surveys. It felt safe, and it felt warm and safe. I was happy. And he got there, you know? - Did he say something?\n- Yeah. Yeah. Remember, I gave you a\nlittle bit of introduction to my father, right? You know him now a little bit, right? - Yeah, yeah. What'd he say about the job? - He said, he just said,\nthis is what he said. I remember to this day what he said. - Yeah.\n- That I do remember. I don't know if it was six or five people, but this I do remember. He said, \"They did a good job. You're gonna have a scar\nthe rest of your life.\" And he left. - Oh man, they did a good job. You mentioned Cus D'Amato,\nlegendary trainer. And you also mentioned it turned out he really cared about you in the book you write\nabout a testimony he gave. I was hoping I could read it 'cause it speaks to your\ncharacter, it speaks to his, it's just powerful. The testimony goes, \"Your honor, I realize you might\nnot know much about me, but I've spent my whole\nlife developing young men. As a boxing manager, I trained two world champions, heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson and light heavyweight\nchampion Jose Torres. I've also helped a lot of other young boys\nstraighten out their lives and build character. I know things about Teddy\nAtlas this court doesn't know. Things you won't find\non his arrest record. This boy has character. He has loyalty. He'll hurt himself before\nhe'll let down a friend. These qualities are rare\nand they shouldn't be lost. He's made mistakes.\nWe've all made mistakes. But I've come to know this\nboy, and if we lose him, we'll be losing someone who\ncould help a lot of people. Please don't take this\nyoung boy's future away. He could be someone\nspecial. Let's not lose him. Please...\" Those are powerful words\nfrom a powerful man. What have you learned about\nlife from Mr. Cus D'Amato? - He gave me a quote and\nhe drilled into my head. I became his guy. You know? He loved me, I loved him. He said to me, \"Teddy, no matter what a man says, is what he does in the end that he intended to do all along.\" That's what I learned from Cus. Rest of it is BS. And a lot of people say things, you just have to give him a minute to let them show you, eventually, what they really meant by it. I also learned from him that everyone's afraid, Cus's way of saying, another great saying, you'll get kick outta this, \"Anyone who's in a situation where fear should be prevalent, where fear is actually\nnecessary to survive the situation, anyone who says that they're not afraid,\nthey're one of two things: They're either a liar or\nthey should go to a doctor, find out what the\nfreak's wrong with them.\" He was right about that. You know, we live in a taboo\nsociety where that word, to a certain extent, is taboo\nbecause it invokes weakness. You know? We are just layers of what\nwe saw and learned since we were kids. We all are. We're\nproducts of those layers. I learned that on my own.\nWell, through some help. At the end of the day, you know, fear, people will find their\nway of avoiding that term. So they use the word anxiety, they use the word, you know, butterflies, apprehension, you know, a million different words. I find all those other\nwords to be cousins of fear. And fear... Fear causes\na lot of things in life. It causes a lot of problems. And it also solves a lot of problems. Without it, we couldn't be great. If we are great, if we ever\nhave a chance to be great, or at least to aspire to be great. - How does fear connect to greatness? That's a profound statement. Without fear we wouldn't\nbe able to be great. - Yeah, you couldn't be great without fear because fear allows you to be brave. The most important word for me in this whole, you know,\nconversation, right, neighborhood, would be selfishness. And it allows you to be\nfor a moment less selfish. One of the things I\nlearned, I guess partly on my own, everyone thinks\nmy greatest teacher was Cus. He was a great teacher, mentor, my greatest teacher was my\nfather, the one who never talked. And I realize one of the things to be better towards great is if you can submit less than we submit. See, one of the things that I'm afraid of, one of the things, I was always quitting,. In my business, it's\nkind of not a good thing. - Every business, I think.\nYours is just more clear. - Yeah. And it hurts more. - (laughs) True, in the moment, at least. - Yeah. In the moment. But you're right, 100% because some things hurt\nfor a long time afterwards, and something like regret. Regret is the worst thing in the world because it's a solitary sentence. And, man oh man... - That's a powerful phrase. Regret is a solitary sentence. Oh boy. You're full of good lines. - (laughs) You know, it wasn't\neasy to accumulate them. - Yeah- - It was a little bit hurtful, but so... Submit less. Because we submit every\nday and if we can get to a place where we submit so compromise ourselves less, we'll get to a better place. You know, again, one of the\nwords for me that attaches to things that give you, that wind up hurting you\nin life and have hurt me in life, one of those\nboogeymen words is the word of convenience, that's\nattached to everything. You know, people disappoint you not because they wanna disappoint\nyou or let you down or betray you because\nthey wanna betray you. They do it because it's\nmore convenient to do than the other thing. An old man once told me, he said to me, I was trying to rationalize something, I was trying to make an\nexcuse for something, I was trying to make\nmyself better than I was, I was trying to say it was okay. And he just looked at me, and he liked me, and he said, \"Teddy, there ain't no such thing\nas being a little pregnant.\" I was like, yeah. Goes, \"Either you're pregnant\nor you're not pregnant, either you're real or you're\nnot real, either you're, you know, truthful or you're not truthful, either you're tough or you're not tough, either you're, you know, committed or you're not committed, either you in or you're out.\" - That applies to a lot of things. - Yeah.\n- Including loyalty. - That's quite a statement. But the lifeblood of\nhumanity for me is loyalty. It's what goes through the veins of, you know, everything has to\nhave some veins in some form. And if humanity has veins, what runs through the veins\nof humanity instead of blood to keep it alive is loyalty. Without loyalty's-\n- That's powerful words. - Without loyalty, we are dead. We're freaking walking, we're vessels. I never understood what a ghost ship was. You know what? As I got older, I know\nwhat a ghost ship is. It's people. It's people that are empty. They got no loyalty, therefore\nthey got no humanity. Therefore they got nothing.\nTherefore, freak them. Freak them. Because, and you know why\nthey don't have loyalty? Convenience. And you know why? Because it's hard to be\nloyal. It's actually hard. I'll be a son of a gun... If you're telling me,\nyeah, it sounds great. Give it to me, give it\nto me, paint me with it. Yeah, it's great. Yeah. I'm loyal. I'm, yeah, this is good. I'm ready. I'm on that team. I'm ready. Put me in coach. I'm ready. \"Okay, now, you have to, you're gonna have to get hurt here.\" \"What do you mean, get hurt?\" \"Oh, well, it's gonna be painful. I mean, to be loyal, you know, you're gonna be in\ndanger because the person that you committed your\nloyalty to, for a reason, because obviously did something in your life, whatever, whatever, you are actually gonna get\nhurt to be loyal to 'em, you're actually gonna...\" \"Hold on a minute. Wait, hold on a minute, coach. Hold on. Call timeout here. Let me think about this, coach, I might need more practice. I'm not ready for the game. I'm not ready to go in the game yet. Gimme a little more practice, coach.\" And it hurts to be\nloyal. It freaking hurts. But without loyalty, we're ghost ships. We got no strength. We got nothing. We got nothing. We got nothing. - I agree with you in a\ndeep fundamental sense, but there's pain that comes with that. I have to ask you to\nintrospect on this part of your life, because of\nyour value for loyalty, as people know, you and Cus\nD'Amato trained young Mike Tyson and the interaction there between the three of you led to the three of you parting ways. Given your value for loyalty, can you tell the full story of what led up to this and maybe the pain you felt from that? - It was, I guess it was\nthe second time in my life I felt betrayed. The first time was when I was, whatever, young, 17, and I got arrested. I was with all these older\nguys, tough guys, whatever. And, supposedly... And the detectives separated us. That's what they do. And you know, they asked\nme who did whatever, who's gun, this, that, you know, all that, the particulars of obviously what we did. And, you know, \"It was me.\"\nAnd they say, \"You sure?\" You don't wanna change\nthat? You don't want... 'Cause your friends changed it. And these cops, they were\nnasty, but they were cops. They were the way, you know, you're gonna wind up in Rikers with, and they're gonna be doing this to you. And I won't even say\nthe things because then why say them, you know, figure it out. But, you know, they're trying\nto get what they're trying to get and, you know,\n\"You wanna change it?\" And... No. But I felt very betrayed, you know? And especially when I\nwas standing in the cell in Rikers looking at the\nairplanes leave LaGuardia Airport. And then hoping I was on one, you know, I was making like a deal with\nGod that let me be on one of those planes and let it crash. I'll take a shot. - Was part of you proud that you didn't give up your friends? - No, because I didn't\nunderstand what proud was. I didn't understand nothing.\nI just understood that... - Rules are rules. You're\njust loyal and that's it. - I didn't even know there was an option. I didn't think there... I know the cops said you could do this, but that there was no option. My father never had an option. But the betrayal, the\nprivate betrayal was like, and so when Cus... We were partners, me and Cus. - Yeah.\n- Cus was retired. This stupid kid goes up\nthere and all of a sudden I start training fighters. First I wanted gloves,\nCus put me in the gloves, I wanted gloves that I had into, whatever. But bottom line is I still wanna fight. I want to turn pro, I wanna\nfight. That was the plan. And Cus had a different plan. Cus was like, you can't, and he had it set up a\nlittle bit, whatever, without getting into it,\nhey, he did me a favor, and I'd like to think he\nknew he was doing me a favor. And you know what? I do think he was. He was doing himself a little bit one too. But he was doing for the greater cause because he believed in\nthis thing of boxing. He believed that it changed lives. He believed that it was worthwhile. He believed that there was a power to it beyond the left hook. - The big picture of\nboxing. He believed in it. - Yeah. He believed that to be a\nchampion, you had to be special. You had to be smart, you had\nto have character. You had... That you had to be a better person and that you couldn't make a champion if you didn't make him\na better person first. And that this, you know,\nthis could strengthen people. The sport could strengthen\npeople in those ways. So he was married to it, and he was old and he needed, there was no one in the gym. It was empty. And it was above a police\nstation, which was crazy. And he needed an heir to the throne. He needed to pass it on to someone. And he saw something. And all of a sudden he saw that my career as\na boxer was less important than having me become\nhis an heir to the throne and become his trainer, his\nman, his guy, to continue, that we could do a lot more\nfor him and for everyone. Not just for him, but for everyone. It was more like to keep it\ngoing. Like it couldn't die. It couldn't die. And Cus was afraid that\nit would die with him. And he committed his whole life to it. He didn't get married because of boxing. So he saw me as, you know,\nthe little bit of, you know, the seed to plant for more things to grow before that plant died. And so he, all of a sudden\nhe says, you can't fight. And I had people tell me that\nI could go somewhere else and fight, and I could, but I couldn't. - Right.\n- 'Cause I'd be disloyal. - Loyalty's everything.\n- Yeah. So I couldn't leave Cus.\nAnd he kind of knew that. And so, you know, I couldn't leave him. And he said, \"You have\nan ability to teach.\" He said, \"Knowledge means nothing.\" He said, \"See these Britannica?\" He had Britannica encyclopedias, the whole set in our library. He said, \"You see these?\" Yeah, I see 'em. \"All the knowledge of the\nworld,\" whatever, \"is in these.\" All right. \"Means nothing if you don't have somebody to convey it to people. Otherwise, it just sits on\na bookshelf. It looks good.\" He goes, \"You have the ability to convey knowledge to people. You are a teacher. You\nwere born to be a teacher. You'd lessen yourself by only being a champion fighter because\nyou'd only take care of one person. You could take care of all kinds of people and you could do this and you could do that and you could do this.\" So we go on this venture, took a minute, 'cause I didn't believe him at first. But finally we, I am, I'm\nthere, I'm training fighters. And then he gets me to buy in, and I was a teacher and I\nstart teaching these kids and there's no one and the gym, it's dead. And all of a sudden there's 10 kids, 15,\n20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45. Catskill Boxing Club, which was\nnever there. Now it's there. And I'm training fighters. I'm taking 'em down to South\nBronx to get experience. One of his former fighters\nknows some others, down to South Bronx, I'm taking down there to get smokers, to get fights when they're\nready, after I teach, I'm wearing out dungarees. I'm getting holes in my dungarees. I was fashionable before\nit was fashionable to have holes in my dungarees. I could've made a lot of money with that. 'Cause I was on my knees\nwith these little kids, 9 years old, 10 years old, 8\nyears old, 10 year, 12, 13, 14. All these kids. And I'm teaching and I'm building a gym. And Cus only came once a week because he was semi-retired, you know. And when he would come once a week, he knew he couldn't gimme money, but he gave me more than money. He gave me praise. Oh. And he said, \"Look what Atlas is doing, he's creating champions!\" And I was like, whoa. Yeah. Wow. I'm doing good. And then all of a sudden,\nafter four years of that, 'cause I was up there\nseven years, eight years, eight years, after about three and a half, four years of that, we get a phone call that\nthey got this kid in prison in Tryon Prison, from one of the guys that knew Cus, Matt Pereski. And there's a state, there's a correctional\nofficer named Bobby Stewart who used to box and Cus had\nhelped him out a little bit. A little bit. And they knew we had this gym now that was really starting\nto become something, because we were winning\ntournaments and everything else. They're going, we got\nthis kid, Mike Tyson, he's 12 years old. He's 190 pounds. He's a mess. But Bobby Stewart got\ninvolved with him, you know, the former fighter. And he's taken a liking to it. And now where he didn't behave at all and he didn't listen to\nanyone now he's listening because Bobby's got a\ncarrot and the carrot is he teaches boxing. And now he's at the point\nnow where we want you to take a look, you and Teddy. All right. Bring him down. - What'd you think when\nyou first saw Mike Tyson? - Well, I wanted to see\nhis birth certificate. 'Cause he, 190 pounds, 12\nyears old and all solid? - Yeah. - You know, really? But yeah. - Just physically, just\nas a physical specimen? - Yeah. And...\n- Big guy. - Yeah. And listen, Cus was\nright. I was a teacher. He was right. And he was\ntesting me even that day. He said, \"What do you think?\" So I said, well, we ain't\ngonna know nothing in the bag. Who the freak cares about that? He knocked the bag down. We gotta put him in with, who, we got no one to put him in that way. They didn't have anyone\nthat way. We gotta test him. Everyone's gotta be tested. And so you gotta put 'em in, responsibly. But let's put him in. Just responsibly. But let's put him in with Bobby\nStewart, former pro fighter, had 14 pro fights. Smaller than Tyson. He was, when he was fighting, he was 175. But still, he's 28 years old. Tyson's 12. Come on. And he'll work with him. Right? So we do, we put him, Tyson,\nhe recognized the moment, he understood this was an\naudition, this was a chance, you know, this was that TV show. Change your life. And he understood that if\nhe passed the audition, he could change, possibly change his life. He wasn't sure what, how\ncould he be sure what exactly, but it was better than what he had. And so he was on audition. So he wanted, he innately understood what we would wanna see. Ferociousness, toughness,\ncharacter, desire, you know, and of course ability. Well, we saw the ability, power, speed. But it was unbridled. It was untaught. It was raw. He didn't\nknow really much at all. At all. But we saw that. But he wanted to show more.\nHe knew that wasn't enough. Again, innate intelligence.\nHe had to show desire. He had to show toughness. And so I was being responsible, after two rounds, that's enough. Normally I don't put a guy into boxing until maybe four months,\nfive months, six months, eight months, 10... It depends what it takes to\nlearn on the floor before it's responsible to put him\nin a ring to actually take on incoming real live\nshells instead of blanks. And so normally I wouldn't have him in, and I knew after today, he wouldn't be in the ring\nagain if I trained him, I would teach him first\nand then he'd get back in a few months. But for this day, it was the\nonly way, it's kind like, I used to make this\nannouncement and Cus loved it. He said, what's training a fighter? What do you look for\ntraining a fighter, Teddy? You know, he asked me this\nridiculous question just to test me. And I say, \"It's like\ngoing to Macy's with...\" Oh, he loved it. I said, \"It's like go to Macy's window.\" And Cus, he goes, \"What do\nyou mean, Macy's window?\" You know, Cus was like boom boom boom. \"What do you mean Macy's window?\" \"Oh, you go to Macy's window\nand they get the window with everything you wanna see, everything in there and it looks great. Oh, everything.\" \"And, yeah. And then what?\" \"Well then you ask\nwhat's in the warehouse, and they tell you nothing.\" (Lex laughing) And Cus says, \"That's\nit. That's a trainer.\" And I wanted to see what\nwas in the warehouse. 'Cause I saw what was\nin the Macy's window. I saw the power, I saw the speed. So he goes two rounds and\nhe gets a bloody nose. Here's the weird thing,\nnot weird, very telling. We knew what we were doing. Not bragging, but we\nknew what we were doing, because he got a bloody\nnose because he got hit. After that bloody, he never\ngot another bloody nose. You know why he didn't get\nhit? 'Cause he learned. He was still strong,\nbut he was smarter now. Anyway, he goes two rounds and I saw, and I'm being responsible\nbecause if he goes more, it's not responsible. I saw what I needed to see. I saw speed, I saw\npower, I saw athleticism. And I saw, I didn't believe him. I thought he was lying to me. I'm just telling you,\nI thought he was lying, trying to act tough when he\nwasn't really feeling tough. It didn't matter. Cus questioned me on it\nafterwards, \"What did you see?\" And when I said, he goes, \"Young master,\" you know, again, he wasn't paying me money,\nso he had to gimme something. Right? And that was better\nthan, that was currency. \"Young master.\" I'm young master, whoa,\nyou know, \"young master,\" you know what I mean? Like, I felt like that\nguy kung fu, you know? Like in the movie, like\nkung fu, grasshopper, when you're ready, when you could take this\noutta my hand, you can leave. And...\n- That's powerful. - Yeah. It was. It worked, Cus knew how\nto work me. And he did. And it worked. And but you know what, I\ndidn't mind being worked. I kind of knew I was being\nshuffled a little bit. - Well you're making it\nsound a little bit negative, but it's also extremely positive. That's a teacher\ninstilling wisdom into you that you carried forward and\nimpacted a lot of people. - Yeah. Cus get the job done.\nBut he did it his way. And he did it for a myriad of reasons. And, but at the end of\nthe day it was all good. And I just had to understand\nthat eventually, later on. But... - And you do the same, you do things your way and\ncarry some of him in you, some of your father in you. - Yeah. That day... You know, that day was\nfunny because when Cus said, what did you see, Teddy? With him, after two rounds,\nI got up in the ring. I knew I was gonna train him. Obviously we weren't gonna say no. And he still had about\nfour months to serve and we were gonna work it out. - [Lex] Yeah. - And when I got up on the ring apron, that's my gym, I'm the boss. You know, people later on\nin life call me a dictator. You know what they said?\nYeah, you're right. I didn't deny, people\nthought, you mean I'm right? Yeah. I'm a dictator. I'm a trainer. I'm the boss. I'm in charge. You wouldn't be here if I wasn't. What the frick you need me for if I'm not freaking in charge? You idiot. Yeah, yeah. Damn right. Well, what do you think? it's a shared responsibility? No, it's my responsibility.\nThat's why you're here. Yeah. Yeah, I am in charge. And you shouldn't be here if\nyou don't understand that. So I get up there and I know that I'm gonna be training them. I gotta show 'em who the boss is. You know, I'm being\nreally frank about this. So I get up there, I say,\n\"That's it, out. No, no.\" You know, this is Tyson. \"No, lemme go. I wanna do another round.\nI wanna do another one. I want... I said out. Did you hear what I said? Because I knew that, you\nknow, he was gonna test me. He was testing me. \"I said get out.\" He got out. - But were you impressed\nwith the fact that he wanted to keep going or no? - Yes, and I recognized\nwhat it really was. So Cus asked me, \"What was that?\" Cus wanna know what the young master saw. So Cus said, \"What was that?\" I said, \"It was an act.\" He goes, \"You saw that? Did he really wanna go?\" I said, no. I said he didn't really wanna go, but he knew that we want him to go and he made himself ready\nto go in order to satisfy. And that's just as good. And Cus said, damn\nright it's just as good. All that matters was not how he got there, but that he got there. That's all that matters.\nThat he got there. That he got to the place\nto act like a fighter. To do what we want him to do. To be ready to persevere, to\ngo beyond the comfort level, to do another round. He didn't want to, damn\nright he didn't want to, but he knew we want him to. And he knew in order to pass\nthe test, he had to do it. And he said, you are right. He goes, now it's gonna\nbe your job to teach him, to make him a fighter that\ndon't get bloody noses, that don't get hit, and we'll get to that\nplace without being coerced to get there, to get to\nthat place on his own, instead of using the things\nthat he had to use to get to that place today. Those things are not going\nto be available one day, when you, and listen to this, you talk about a man being prophetic 'cause it's pretty good. You talk about man being on\nthe job, on the money, Lex, he says, how do you think\nhe finishes the sentence? He goes, because someday\nyou, because, you know, you're gonna have to make sure that he learns these\nthings because, you know, he'll be your first heavyweight champ. What did you just say? He's 12 years old. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - He's been arrested 30 times. - [Lex] Yeah. - He's getting outta\njail out of, you know, juvenile detention try out, he's a mess in a lot of ways. There's a lot of things we find out later, a lot of problems, weaknesses. He goes, and you are,\nthat's part of your job. That'll be part of your job. And, but he really said that\nhe, and then he turned to him. He goes, \"You wanna come\nlive with us, young man? You wanna be a fighter?\" \"Yes.\" Even that, Cus said to me later, what do you think about that? I said... - [Lex] The way he said yes. - The, yeah, the way he said, \"Yes, sir.\" Yeah. He said, \"What do\nyou think about that?\" And we're talking, I said, ain't gonna be that polite in\na little while down the road. Again, he knew that that's\nwhat he felt that he needed to project himself as to\npresent himself as to get to where he wanted to get to. He goes, you know? Yeah. - Did you see what Cus was seeing in terms of the heavyweight champion of the world? - No. Again, the easiest\nanswer would be yes. Teddy's just, Teddy knows, genius. Wow. Teddy's wow. No no. No. No. But again, it was my job. And I just, my job, it was\nsimple, simpler than Cus, Cus knew too much. I knew nothing. I just knew, you know,\nrudiments of boxing, I knew what it took to be a\nfighter and how to execute it. The steps of executing\nit. So I took those steps. The rest of it, you get\nblurred by those other things. I wasn't blurred by those other things. It was just, get 'em in the gym, make 'em mentally stronger, make 'em face things and\nteach 'em how to slip punches, and create holes, and fill those freaking holes\nwith devastating punches, this is Cus, and what are you gonna do? I'm gonna teach 'em to\nfill holes and fill 'em with punches with bad intentions. And that became the moniker. And then Tyson would say that I'm throwing punches\nwith bad intentions. Yes, you are. And, you know... - How do you make him mentally tougher? So that part of the job, the, you said the don't get a bloody nose, but the part of the job, what\nmakes him mentally tougher? How do you do that? - Most important part of the job. To make him face things. Make him face where he\nis lying to himself, where he's submitting. But we start this conversation\nwith submission. Submit less. Submit less. Submit less every day. Submit less. Cus only come\nto the gym once in a while. And if I had him sparring, he would come because\nthat was his project. That was the heavyweight. Now he came, you know, it put\nlife in Cus, Cus had life, he was losing a little life. But that made the light\nbulb bright again. It did. And it was great to see.\nI felt proud of that. I felt connected to that. And that's why when it\nall went bad and Cus took the side that... The only side he could take, the side of the next\nheavyweight champ of the world. But he left me, his\npartner, the Young Master. And of the second time I\nget betrayed and I'm like, for a while I thought\neverything Cus taught me, said to me was a lie. I didn't wanna be any part of it any more. Until I got a little more mature, and I got a little past\nthat where I was able to understand, I was able to understand that just because so many that you perceived\nas great in every area is you find to be weak in certain areas, doesn't mean that they can't\nstill be what they want to you. It's something that can\nbe understood or forgiven. It's hard, it's hard to get to that place, to forgive somebody in that kind of way that I felt betrayed. Because Cus told me the most\nimportant thing was loyalty. Cus told me he loved\nme because I was loyal, Cus told people that the\nreason that he went to court was because I didn't give up anybody, even though it meant put me\nin the risk of going to jail for 10 years. And Cus felt that he admired those traits. And so I assumed that he\nwould show the same traits. And he took a deal. He took a deal. He took a deal. He signed the papers\nthat those so-called feds might've signed. You know, he took a deal to, you know, to have the future heavyweight\nchamp as it turned out. And to let me, you know, to\nlet me go, to sign the deal, to let me take, you know, take the weight. - For people who don't know, Mike was inappropriate with\na young girl and you pulled the gun on him. I don't know if there's\ndeeper things to say about that situation, but\nwhy do you think Cus made the decision to cut you\noff from both Mike Tyson and from Cus, Cus D'Amato,\nlike to break that, when he valued loyalty so much. - I served my purpose, I got him to where he needed to get,\nbrought life back in the gym. If I wasn't in the gym\nat that particular time, Tyson never would've been in the gym. There would've been no\ngym to bring him to. When they called up and made\nthat phone call to bring him to the gym, there\nwould've been no activity. There would've been no boxing program. There would've been, you know, no trainer training\nhim 24/7 the way I was, where Cus wasn't capable\nof doing that at that point in his life. But then again, it's not, poor Teddy. I get the benefit of a career. I get the benefit of knowledge.\nI get the benefit of a life. I get the benefit of learning\n,of becoming hopefully a better person. I got the benefit of being betrayed again. - That's a hell of a\nstatement right there. I don't know what the benefit of that is. - You can learn to forgive weakness. You know? When you realize how easy it is to be weak. And when you realize\nthat, somebody asked me, how did you get to the point\nwhere you could forgive? Right? It's a pretty good question. Pretty simple, pretty basic,\npretty important. Right? And I didn't understand, I understood, but I did understand,\nimmediately, for me, I said, how can I not forgive somebody? It becomes easier to learn how to forgive when you're still trying\nto forgive yourself. When you're still in the process of trying to forgive yourself for all\nyour own inherent weaknesses and betrayals of people, like my father, in different ways that\nwe forget very easily because it's handy and\nit's a way of surviving. It's a lot easier to figure\nit out, rationalize it, to find forgiveness when you realize that you still haven't\nfigured out completely how to forgive yourself. I'm still trying to figure that out. And so that helped me figure out how to forgive Cus, because to figure out how to forgive me, I had to understood\nwhy I did these things. Where the weaknesses came from, where the selfishness came from, where the convenience came\nfrom, that they really existed. But they didn't exist for malice. They existed for me not\nbeing prepared to understand that I could be stronger,\nto wanna be stronger. And then I looked at Cus,\nhe wanted to be stronger, but he got to a point in\nlife where he had been strong for a lot of his life. He was strong with me. He was strong with a lot\nof things in his life. And does everyone deserve\na pass in life, where... He got to a place where\neverything was in one basket. The basket of boxing. He once told me that he never got married 'cause it would've been selfish to a woman to have gotten married when\nhis whole life was boxing. That he couldn't give to a\nkid. He couldn't give to her. He couldn't... And then I thought about\nit, he had no money, really. And Jim Jacobs and Bill\nCaden took care of the bills. So he didn't really need money that way. But the one, what was the\npayoff of that kind of life? That kind of commitment?\nThat kind of sacrifice? Really, what was the payoff? The payoff was to have champions. To have a champion that\nwould keep your name alive. You know that word, legacy?\nLike what does it mean? Sometimes it's just a word.\nSometimes it's more than a word. It's as a reprieve, it's a pension plan. Is being given a pension on\nyour way out for the rest of your life. For your life. Wherever you're going. You're going to... Wherever\nyou're going for eternity. It's the only thing that you take with you is what you left behind. And for Cus, it was all\nabout leaving behind a mark, a mark, that of champion. Yeah, it was attached\nto ego. We all have it. Yeah. it was attached to some\nselfishness and all, but, yeah, it was also attached to wanting to leave something great behind. To know that you were part of it. That you existed for a reason. That you sacrificed for a reason. And all that freaking\npain I brought my father, I was searching for something. Yeah, I made it into a righteous search. I made it into, I did. And I made it into, it was\nokay because it was righteous. And I, but it still did\ndamage. It still did damage. It still hurt people. It still\nbetrayed my father's trust. And Cus betrayed mine. But he didn't do it maliciously. He did it out of, again... My father came home. This is how I'm gonna connect it. My father came home from\nwork one night, 12 o'clock, and I was waiting out, and like I said, I was over 9-10 years\nold and he got mad at me. He goes, \"Go to bed.\nWhat are you doing up?\" I said, \"I'm waiting for\nyou. I'm waiting for you.\" And he said, \"Well, go to bed.\" I said, \"No, What were you doing?\" He said, \"I was at the\nhospital.\" You were there... \"Why were you there so late?\" You know? He answered me. He said there was a patient,\nthere was a sick patient. I said, \"Oh, he must be better now, because you're his doctor.\" You know, because my\nfather could fix anything. My father, nothing got in the\nway of the truth. Nothing. Nothing. Even blowing his son's bubble. Matter of factly he said to me, \"No, he's not gonna get better. He is gonna die.\" And... So as a 9-year-old kid,\nyou know, you're a kid. You're selfish. You know, not in a bad way, but, you know, you want what you... And I said... I said two things. First I said, how, you are\nhis doctor, how? It can't be. And then I said, I just\nsaid it almost angry, \"Then why were you there?\" Like, you should have been here with me. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you know what he said to me? \"'Cause you don't give up on life. Go to bed,\" and... - Don't give up on life. - And that's, I finally\nconnected the dots. This idiot, that didn't\ngraduate high school, I finally connected the dots. I was asking Cus to give up on life. You don't give up on life. You don't give up on aspirations of life. Life is all forms of life. It doesn't have to be a\nphysical form of it. It's life. It's having a reason to be alive. It's having a reason to have tomorrow. And Cus's only reason to have tomorrow was to have another heavyweight champ. And Teddy Atlas, even though we were together all those years, and we were partners\nand we trained together and we were, you know, the only thing we didn't\ndo was what they did in the Indian movies\nwhere they cut the finger and they became blood brothers. That's the only thing we didn't do. And I felt like we did\nthat. Without cutting. And now here we are.\n- And still... - And he freaking betrayed me, this! And then all of a sudden\nI connected the dots. I was like, he didn't betray\nme in that cold sense. He didn't give up on life.\n- Didn't give up on life. Years later, Mike Tyson apologized to you. What's meaningful to you about that? How does that fit the story? - I wanna be the great\ngracious guy right now. Say, oh, I'm so human that, you know, a man's man enough to say, sorry. That's it. We're good. I wanna be, really, that's the best\npresentation of Teddy Atlas I could put out there. He's a good guy. He forgives. He's a good guy. He's a standup guy and he's\na good guy. I'm not sure. If he truly did it for himself, that he really did it because he felt that it was true. But if he's persuaded by other things, he was in the middle, I\nknow I'm taking it too deep, I know it, but what am I gonna do? He was in the middle of 12\nsteps with the, you know, getting out of drugs, alcohol, 12 steps. Which is a commendable\nthing, really, it is. And he's taking the steps. And part of the steps was to admit all, to apologize to all people\nyou offended in life. Okay. But are you doing it for the 12 steps or are you doing it\nbecause you really truly have come to terms with\nbelieving what you did? Was that hurtful to me? And that it matters to you\nthat it was that hurtful to me. And that you were wrong in doing it. Did you do it for... I know that's deep. I know that I'm a freaking idiot. I'm a, you're a Teddy freaking, you are... You should be better than\nthat. He's better than you. Maybe he is better than me. Maybe he is. Really? Seriously. Maybe he is. And I took it. He put his hand, I took it. We hugged. He said, I love you. I, yeah, yeah. But I wanna believe, but\nwhat did Cus tell me? No matter what a man says, it's what he does in\nthe end that he intended to do all along. So to this day today, was it really genuine or was\nit reflexive of that moment for him to get what he needed\nto, you know, for that step? Or was it truly for what I needed, to really that he really\ncared, that what he did to me, caused me to do what I did, because I did something that\nwas pretty damn bad to him too. Is he able to deal with that and put that where it has to be put? Is he able to put that? Or is it just he did\nsomething he had to do and maybe he's sorry he did it. I know him... Look, I appreciated that he, I would've rather been in a private place. - Yeah. So what people don't know, you were in the middle\nof commentating a fight and he walked up from\nbehind you and he said he was sorry, he shook\nyour hand, gave you a hug. I didn't know he said, I love you. - Yeah. He's emotional. I get\nemotional a little bit too. But he's emotional. And he can be... I can see why people have a fascination and a love affair with him right now. 'Cause he was, because, you know, he was, the meteor, the meteor that went\nacross the sky that is, if they didn't see it, their\nparents told him about it. There was a meteor that\ncame across the sky one day. And the meteor's walking\naround in the room now. And that's the meteorite. And it actually landed here. And that's it right there. And now he's come a long way. And now he's, you know,\nhe's more human and he's lovable, you know, and compassionate. And he cries. And I get the fascinating,\nI get the love affair. I get it. Because we're inherently, we're\npeople that wanna forgive. We're people that... We wanna be good. And part of being good\nis to forgive people and to show compassion to people. And so, and when somebody's been damaged, to acknowledge they've been damaged, to acknowledge that, you know they've been damaged and you care about them being damaged\nand how do you show care? Through admiration, you know, in some ways almost through adulation. And he's getting adulation\nfrom people like, you know, which is to an incredible level, and it's because, it's a phenomena. But I get it. I understand it. And... I don't know if he gets it. I don't know if underneath all of this... He's a complex guy. He's a sensitive guy. I don't know. And I am too. - Yeah. One complex guy talking\nabout another complex guy. - I don't know if underneath it all, where he's really truly at, as far as that day that\nhe said that to me. - Is there part of you\nthat's sorry to Mike, for pulling-\n- I'm not sorry. - Pulling the gun on him?\n- Yeah. And that's, listen, that's fair. I know dimensions of\nhuman nature too well, to not know that he still\nhas to have certain, because I have those strong feelings. What? It's not fair for him to have them? Damn right it's fair. Now, he could look at it, if he was to be held\nto his word that night, that he just acknowledges\nthat what happened he deserved because of what he, you know, the position he put me\nin and he put himself in, what he did? And I wouldn't change nothing. You know? - But still, you don't regret\npulling the gun on him? - I regret that I had to. I regret very much that I had to, that, I regret very much. - He crossed the line. - I hated him for putting\nme in that position, that, you know, how dare he think that somebody's feelings are that trivial, that the\nway I would feel about myself and the way the girl\nwould feel about herself, that was 11 years old at the time, how she would feel about herself. How dare that he think it's that trivial that, you know, that I shouldn't be ready\nto freaking to both die and kill for that. - Why didn't Cus D'Amato\nsee it in a deeper way and talk through it? - He did. The word came back to me. But\nof course, what does it mean? But the word came back to me\nthat Cus said you were right. But if he took the side of Teddy, he would destroy\npotentially a great fighter. - Why do you think that... Okay, if you were to try\nto understand the point he was making, why is that true? Isn't the part of greatness\nthat you said is building the character of knowing what\nis right, what, you know? - Cus was afraid to go there where he used to not be afraid. Because it's kind of\nlike you're never afraid of going up. And I get it, you know,\nwhen I train a fighter now, if I come out of retirement, I train a fighter now, I feel in camp like I'm on death row every day. That if... Every day, I try to\nretrace my memory and say, did I feel this way when I was younger? I don't remember feeling this way. I feel every day a dreadful\nfeeling that if I don't get this right, I betrayed everything. I betrayed the fighter's trust. I betrayed what I'm supposed to be. And then one day I tried to figure it out, why do I feel this way so intense? I was in camp for two months, training a guy for the world title a couple, few years ago, fighting the hardest puncher\nin the world at the time. Adonis Stevenson. And the\nfighter was Ukrainian. And I was, you know, brought in to train him for that fight. And he trusted me, and changed\nhis whole style. Trusted me. Oh my God, I went to bed every night like praying,\ndread, waking up, dread, my stomach down to here, every day saying, what if I fail him? What if everything that I told him was gonna happen don't happen? What if I fail him? What if he trusted me and\nI betrayed that trust? And the thing was, with Cus was, you know, he used to be stronger than that. And then I tried to figure\nit out why I got this way and why it was so dreadful\nto me and why I felt like I was on death row every\nday training a fighter. Like, did I do enough? Did I do right? Will we accomplish what we, will we accomplish what I\npromised him we would accomplish? Would I keep my word? And then I started thinking, well, how did I become this weak? How did I freaking become, I was a pretty strong freaking guy. How did I become this weak? And then finally, I think I\nfigured it out. You know why? Because I was always working to get up. But once I finally got up, now I was looking down\nand it finally hit me. I said, I didn't wanna lose. I said there was nothing\nto lose on my way up. Now all of a sudden, there's something to\nlose when you're up there and you're looking down. - That's where he was. - And that's where Cus was. Cus was at the end of his rope. He accomplished the two world champs. All this stuff, right? Everything. He, and he did it right. Now all of a sudden it\nwasn't about moving forward, it was about not falling down. Holy cow. I was like, I\ngot it, Cus, I got it. I got it. You didn't wanna fall down. Oh my God, you didn't wanna fall. And he, this was his last chance... You don't give up on life. This was his last chance to live forever. To make everything he did worthwhile. To have the youngest... It wasn't just heavyweight\nchamp, you gotta remember, he was the youngest\nheavyweight champ ever. And to have that, it was okay to die now. And how's loyalty to someone\nnamed Teddy Atlas gonna get in the way of that? That's a tidal wave that there ain't no wall\nthat's been made high enough to stop that tidal wave. And now I'll stop myself. Yeah, there is, but it would\nhave to be awful big one. And you know what, who are we to say that we could ever\nbuild that wall that big? Who's any of it? Who am I to say? - Do you think, if you were to put yourself\nin the shoes of Cus, Cus D'Amato, can you see yourself having the big enough wall? Or you would choose loyalty? - Now, if I answer the way I feel, then I'm, you know, I'm making myself John Wayne again. - You don't have to answer that. I think loyalty, loyalty is important. - No matter what a man says, it's what he does in\nthe end that he intends to do all along. I didn't make that up, Cus did. And when this all went down, those words came freaking\nechoing into my freaking ears. I didn't want them. Cotton doesn't help. And they freaking kept\ncoming into my ears. And what do you think,\nstill an immature kid at the time, you know, I was young, still an immature kid at the time, what the freak do you\nthink my response was? You were full of... - Yeah.\n- But I got past that. - Do you forgive Cus? Have you found forgiveness? - Listen, I forgive him\nbecause he gave me more than he took away from me. If I can't, what kind of man am I to, if I can't at least acknowledge that and be grateful for that. He gave me more than he took from me. And I'm grateful for that. I'm also grateful for what I gave him, that I had, you know, that\nI did give him something. And at that point in his life, you know, a place, a place to still, to still have test tubes\nand chemistry experiments. You know? A laboratory where you could\nstill create a great fighter. And I helped give him that. I helped, I was part of\nthat lab and making sure that lab was there and just\nthat there was the existence of test tubes in the place. Because you can't freaking do experiments without test tubes. - Now you're the scientist,\nwith the test tubes. - Yeah. I guess so. And I just hope that, what I said earlier is really, it's really my thread through this whole thing. When you say, can you forgive Cus? I'm still trying to forgive myself. And if I can have hope\nthat I can forgive myself, I think that hope has\nto start with the power to forgive someone else. How can I ever forgive\nmyself for all my failings and figure it out if I\ncan't start and practice it by forgiving someone else\nfor some shortcomings? And for me, that's the only sense of sometimes a very hard thing to make sense of. That's my North Star. That's my compass. Cus used to make me laugh. You know, me and him\ndid everything together and we drive and we get lost in the city. We get lost in the Bronx\nand he'd get all frustrated and he said, \"Atlas,\nyou are a great trainer, but turn you around, you spin you around and you're lost.\" And I said, \"Me or we?\" Because I was the only one\nwho would argue with him. And it was really funny\nsometimes. And I said, we or me? We or... He goes, \"Ah, I don't get...\" \"Cus, you are lost! I'm lost! What are you talking about?\" And then all of a sudden\nCus couldn't give in. He just couldn't admit,\nhe couldn't give in. You know what he said to me,\nall of a sudden, he goes, \"When I was in the army,\nif I had a compass, I could get out of the woods.\" I said, \"We're not in the\nwoods, we're not in the army, we don't have a compass. Cus! Cus!\" \"Just, don't argue with me.\" One time we're driving, I wanna get back to Catskill. We just finished at the Bronx. It's been a long day. You know, visiting the other ring, houses and everything else that he took me through for the 1800-time. And he would fall asleep. You know, he was getting\nolder and he would... And he would just fall asleep in the car. So what do you think?\nI went a little faster. Right? Because before he went to\nsleep, he said, don't speed. So I don't consider myself,\nI try to be an honest guy. I try to be a freaking, but, you know? - It was the fight with six guys. - What did I say earlier?\nTry to do less submitting. - Yeah.\n- Really, in all places. Try to submit a little less. Try to lie a little less\ntoday, a little less. Try to get stronger. Try\nto get a little better. So here we are and we're driving and all of a sudden he's, what did I do? 80, 75? Probably. Probably did,\nyou know, whatever. And all of a sudden he wakes up. \"You were speeding.\" Oh, I lied. \"No, I wasn't.\" \"Don't lie.\" \"I'm not lying.\" \"You lied again. You were speeding.\" Now, come on. This guy,\nhe's, you know what I mean? He's unbelievable. So I gotta freaking, you know, he's David Copperfield. I wanna know the trick. I wanna know how he freaking,\nhe made this thing disappear. So I said, what are you\ntalking, how do you know? He goes, \"'Cause I timed you. I looked at the post\nnumber,\" and I'm like, what? \"I looked at the post number\non the side of the road where we were,\" whatever mile, that. And I never knew they even existed. I look and I said, yeah,\nthere's little numbers. - You start timing and then fell asleep. - Yeah. He timed it and he looked, he goes, \"We couldn't have got from\nhere to there in that amount of time, unless you were\ngoing 75 miles an hour.\" And I'm like, all right.\n- Smart man. - All right. I'm impressed. Don't try to get the mileage. The mile per hour part right. It's enough that you\ngot me. That's enough. I'm... Yeah. I said, and I'm not gonna do that now. I'm, you know, and just, he helped me in crazy ways\nwhere there would be times where I wanted to be, you\nknow, where you wanted to be, whatever. Right? Convenient, weak, submit. Right? And then all of a sudden,\nall of a sudden Cus, in my mind, Cus was\nthere with the stopwatch (laughs) and I'd be like, you know, no. You know, where I was about\nto say yes to whatever that particular situation was. (phone ringing) - Somebody had to call. Hello? Hello. Yes. Doing great. Thank you. Just for the record, never\nhad a phone call like this. It's hotel security. The question is he asked\nme is, \"Are you okay, sir?\" Are you okay? Are we okay? - I think so. I think so so far. - [Lex] Yeah. - You know, I can only go like so far. It's kinda like that old joke, you know, where the guy jumps off\nthe Empire State Building? And he's falling down. And he's\ngoing, you know, 80th floor. 70th floor. 60th floor. 50th. And he gets past the 50th floor and they're looking him\nout the window and he goes, \"How am I doing?\" \"So far so good.\" I don't know where it's gonna end, but... - So Mike Tyson is\nconsidered by many to be one of the great boxers, one\nof the greatest boxers of all time, heavyweight boxers. What do you think on the\npositive side made him great? - I don't know if he was ever great. I know he was sensational. I know he was the greatest\nmix of maybe speed and power ever. I know he was one of the greatest punchers from either side of the\nplate, left or right. There's been great punchers\nwith just the right hand. Like Earnie Shavers and\nDeontay Wilder and Max Baer. I don't know if there's ever been anyone who could punch as good\nas he did on either side with either hand, other than\nJoe Louis and a few others. I don't know if there's\never been such a combination of speed and power to that\npure level that he had. And it was a pure level. I don't know if there was\never as good a fighter as Tyson was for maybe\none night he was great where he wasn't tested, but he might've been ready\nto be tested that one night against Michael Springs. And when he took him apart in 90 seconds, I think I saw a great fighter that night. I don't think you can be\ngreat unless you have all the requirements of being great. - What does it take to be a great fighter? Truly great. - To not rely on someone's\nelse's weakness to be strong. To be strong on your own. Too often he relied on\nother people's weakness, whether it's by being\nintimidated or whether it was because his talent was\nso much greater than theirs that it was like putting\na monster truck in there with a Volkswagen. And the Volkswagen was gonna get crushed. No matter how much horsepower\nthe Volkswagen might've had under the hood and\nyou put under the hood, it was gonna get crushed. The monster truck was not\ngonna allow it to be a contest. And to be able to find a way\nwhen your talent wasn't enough. He didn't find a way when\nhis talent wasn't enough. And I'm not making\nstatements if I'm not ready to put some evidence, you know, like if we were in a courtroom, exhibit A, when he fought Buster Douglas... Buster Douglas matched his will and didn't get intimidated,\nstood up to him. He didn't do what most people did. He didn't submit even a\nlittle bit. Not that night. He had in the past, but\nthat night he didn't. Why? Because Buster had a secret\nweapon that night. His mother. Buster's mother had died\na few months previous. He loved his mother very much.\nBuster had always had talent. Big heavyweight, talented,\ncan punch, technically solid. He was all those things. Always was. But he quit in fights. He did\nless than he should have done. He never lived up to his ability. He gave in, he submitted,\nhe wasn't strong enough. He never had a reason to be strong enough. When his mother died, he had a reason. Nothing could hurt him as much\nas his mother dying hurt him. Mike Tyson included. That night Mike Tyson\ncould not hurt him as much as his mother had hurt him by dying. That night he had a reason\nto be strong for his mother. And he was strong. He was everything he was\nsupposed to be and more. And he stood up to Mike. And Mike for the first time\nmaybe ever was in a fight where he had to overcome something, where he had to be more\nthan talented, more than a puncher, more than a\nguy with scintillating speed. And he wasn't. And then that night got followed by another night with Holyfield. Holyfield wasn't as\ntalented as him, as big, as much a puncher. But Holyfield had the character. He was strong in ways\nthat Tyson wasn't strong. He was strong in a way\nwhere he could find a way. He was willing to find a way. He's willing to go to the cliff, to truly die before he submitted. You know, a lot of stuff is just words. They're gonna have to\ncarry me out on the shield. Yeah, sure, sure. Okay. Yeah. Until it comes time to\nbe carried out on the shield. Sometimes there's people\nthat actually mean it. - [Lex] You think Mike didn't have that? - Well, all right, let's\njust say arbitrarily, I don't have his record on me. Let's say he was 55 and 5. I know he had about 5 losses. All right. Let's say he was 55 and 5. Right? A lot of knockouts. I have a saying, a fight's not a fight until\nthere's something to overcome. Until then it's just\nan athletic exhibition. Contest. Yeah. Who's a better athlete? Who's got more quick twitch fibers? Who's more developed? Who's in better this, who's more developed in\nthose physical areas. But a fight is not a fight until there's\nsomething to overcome. Okay? So if you go by my definition, not\nWebster's, my definition, which I think means something... Mike Tyson was only in\nfive fights in his life. The five fights where there\nwas something to overcome, and he didn't overcome it. Now, I know people hate me\nfor this, including Tyson. I understand. Hate me. Oh, you are a hater. 'Cause you weren't with 'em, you didn't make the money because this, because of that, because you got betrayed. I think I'm better than that.\nI hope I'm better than that. I believe I'm better than\nthat. I'm not a hater. I've broadcast fights for\n25 years on ESPN where there was some people in the\ncorner I did not like. And if they did a good job,\nthis guy's doing a great job. And then there were guys that I liked and I had friendship, he messed up and we\nweren't friends no more. Friendship gotta be tested. Remember that? So we weren't friends no\nmore. But why did I do that? Because it was my job. It\nwas more important for me... When it's all over with, the only thing you are\nleft with is, I mean, we're gonna be dust, all of us, right? The only thing we're left\nwith is what carries on, our reputation, you know,\nlegacy, whatever that is. But our reputation, that's\nall we're left with, and that's all our kids are left with. I want it to be as good as it can be. I've always had a ability, I've done a lot of things wrong and I've\nhad a lot of lackings. But the one strength I've\nhad, if I had a strength, is to understand, somehow,\nthrough osmosis, I guess, to learn the lesson that was important is not what's in front of\nyou for those five seconds, for that moment in life. It's what's left behind\nyou when those five seconds are gone, when that what, whatever it is that you're\ndealing with, you know, whatever the, that moment\nis, whatever, that moment, what you do in that moment, the action of that moment is\ngonna stay with you and be you. It's gonna become you. What you face for that moment... It's gone. It's gone in\nthe air, in an instant. It's gone. It's done. Whether you stand up there\nand you get shot in the head and the guy freaking blows your brains out or you freaking, you stand up, or you're fighting a guy\nwho's like a scary guy to fight, but you fight\nhim and you beat him or he beats you up. But how you represented yourself in that moment is all that matters. That's gonna live... What\nhappened don't matter. It don't matter that you\ngot shot in the head. I know that sounds absurd, but if you believe that it\nwas important to stand up and take the chance to get shot in the freaking head\nrather than to live like an empty vessel, you know what? That's all that freaking matters. And somehow that got freaking wrapped into this freaking head of mine. Like, that's what matters.\nThat's all that matters. You know how many times I went and there were things, whether it was with this\none, with Tyson, with that, I didn't wanna be there,\nI was scared to death, but I was more scared,\nI was more scared... - Living with regret?\n- How I would've felt. - [Lex] Yeah. - I don't wanna be in\nsolitary confinement the rest of my life with that\nfreaking guy in the cell next to me called regret. I don't freaking wanna\nbe next to that guy. If I wanna freaking go down\nthat road, I'll watch Papillon. You know what I mean? And I'll get my fill from that. But I don't wanna freaking live it. I'm afraid of what my\nchildren would think of me if I fail in those areas. Why? Because that's forever. When I'm closing my\neyes for the last time, I don't wanna have that fear. I don't wanna have that fear, you know, whether I'm going down there\nor whether I'm going up there. You know, I laugh because\nI was around guys years ago that used to, when we\ntalk about that, you know, in jest, you know, and I would get a kick out of this one guy who've\nbeen around the block a few times when he say, \"Hey Teddy, I ain't worried about that. I\ngot friends in both places.\" (both laughing) - That's a good line. - And I thought it was good. Listen, Mike Tyson, you want me to say he was a great fighter? Then you want me to betray what I really, you know what I mean? You want me to do that? I ain't doing it for, listen, I could do it to be a bigger Teddy Atlas and I know it would work for me. I know it would be, it'd do\ngreat promotional work for me. I know it would make me more\npopular in certain area. I know it. I'm not that dumb. I'm not that dumb. But I also know what\nelse it would do to me. And I don't want it to do that to me. I think he was a great talent. I think maybe the night\nwith Michael Spinks, maybe the night with Mike, maybe he could've been that fighter. Maybe he could. But he didn't never really get tested. But he might've been ready no matter what, I have to be tested that\nnight. That's how good he was. That's how for, even though\nit was a guy who used to be a light heavyweight, I get it, but was still a guy who beat Larry Holmes, who still had something\nleft, Michael Spinks. So, and a great puncher and an Olympic gold medalist,\nbut, and a special fighter. One of the great light\nheavyweights of all time. You know what Mike Tyson\nwas? He was a meteor. He was a meteor that struck across, and not too many meteors,\nand we still talk about him, and unlike Halley's Comet, he came back and he's walking\naround and he has become greater after his career, more loved, more beloved, more awed. And he's been forgiven. He found the fountain of\nforgiveness. I don't know. I wish I could find that. Where he has been forgotten\nfor all his shortcomings. All the things that he may\nhave done, may not have done. We don't know. Only him and God know. But he's been forgiven of all that. And he's been not only forgiven, he's rised above it and above that and been brought above that, he's been brought to the pyramids of the greatest athletes\nthat, in the world. And in every way. In every way, as a person, as a fighter, as a historian, as a\nfigure, as a celebrity. I mean-\n- As even a philosopher. - Everything. So I will take it back. All right? All you guys out there, you forgive me? He's the greatest of all time if you encapsulate all that, if you encapsulate everything\nI just tried to describe and explain, if you put that all, he's the greatest of all time. Yeah, he is. But he still might be 0-5. In a record of 55 fights, he might, in Teddy Atlas's book, again,\nI got friends in both places. So it's okay, wherever\nI go, I have company, somebody there will like\nme, despite me saying this, he might be 0-5 because\nof 5 fights where there was something to overcome,\nwhich really defines a fight. He came, he didn't find a way. - Let me ask Teddy Atlas to introspect on the human nature here. As part of the complexities\nof your feelings on this whole thing is that\nyou know, to some degree, that if you were coaching Mike Tyson, he could be truly great? - I know, I'm gonna cut you\nright off because you asked a million dollar question. I wish you didn't, but you did. You did. 'Cause that's why...\n- When do I get paid? - That's why you get paid. I get it. You took the\nwords outta my mouth. That's why you are where you are. And that's why I'm here. - [Lex] (laughs) The humility. - I'm going to, again, full disclosure, it's important, right? I'm gonna cheat, I'm gonna\ntake some of Cus's wisdom. All right? A little bit of mine. Cus told somebody that if\nTeddy Atlas got his way, he might've been a better person, but we would've risked him\nnot being a great fighter. Now, I believe, and I thought Cus did, and I think he did up to\nthat point in his life, that part of your strength\nof character made you a great fighter, and\ntruly a great fighter. And part of that battle\nto be a better person, that fight, if you will,\nto be a better person, to overcome the things,\nto be a better person, part of that fire you\nhave to go through to be a better person. I really truly bought into\nit. And I'm in for life. That is really the only\nway to be a great fighter. And I don't think that's what Cus meant. I thought he meant, I think he meant that\nCus knew more than I did of what was about to\ncome and what would come and what the world was. How people would try to steal him, how people would take him, and how people would steal his guy. The last thing he had, the really, the thing that he lived for, 'cause he lived to have\nanother heavyweight champ, the greatest fighter ever, Cus, in Cus's mind, he could be. And I believe that Cus knew that he could put forward a guy that had the ability to be the greatest fighter ever, without fully completing\nthe mission of what it takes to really be great, but that he wouldn't be\naround to have to witness it. And that he wouldn't, he was\nwilling, he would, oh man, this is awful. He's willing to concede that\nhe might be dead in order to have eternal life, in\norder to have greatness. And which Cus does have greatness. And part of that greatness\nis attached to Tyson. And he deserves it. He deserves\nit, Cus was a great man. And I wouldn't be here partly without him. - But that was part of the calculation. - I know that's deep and\nI know that's, oh God, I hate myself right now. But Cus, he knew he was getting out free. He knew he was gonna not have to be there. He was getting off easy. Oh, Teddy, how do you say\nsomeone's gonna be dead, they're getting off easy? Well, I'll say it again in case you didn't hear me, all right? He was gonna get off\neasy and not have to face where he came up short. Because he did his job. 'Cause he put forward the\ngreatest fight of all time and you guys screwed it up. And he knew that that might happen. But you guys screwed it up. And whatever. That's your fault. That's on... I'll tell you, Tyson will be mad at this, but that's on Tyson. How can you say that, Teddy, he loved me. I'm not saying he didn't\nlove you, but he loved him. He loved some other stuff too. And I don't know if Tyson could ever come to grips like with that. And it's not his job to. But it's my job not to hide from it. I know Cus mentions that other people just only think they know. - Did Cus know? Did Cus know this about\nhimself? Did he reflect? Did he introspect? - Well, he sent the message to me. Cus sent a guy to me.\nMy wife was pregnant. We were living in an apartment in Catskill on Coe Hill Road. We went through all this. And I was getting ready to move to Staten Island, and we\nstill were there for a little while before we did. You know, after all this went down. He sent a guy to me, to the house, secret, whatever you wanna call it. My wife, me. So, I listened to him. Cus said, if you leave, I'm a messenger, you know,\nwhatever, if you leave, this was in a aftermath of\nwhat, the gun, the whole thing. You gotta remember Tyson\nwas a ward of the state. He was put in Cus's custody.\nCus was looking to adopt him. For obvious reasons. So he\nhad control, and he loved him. How dare I say anything less? I won't. But it made sense too. But he\nwas a ward of the state still. Do you know what that\nmeans? There's rules. It means the state's still overlooking it. If he ain't living the\nright life, you know, you gotta remember he came out, you know, he came out of a jail. So reform school. But if he ain't living the life, he could be taken away from Cus. What's not living the right life? Well, he wasn't in school no more. They didn't know about it. He had some things that were going on. We won't get into that right now, in school and different things, whatever. And he had his trainer\nput a gun to his head. That ain't so good. If a report came back to\nthem that that happened, he would've been taken away from Cus. That couldn't happen. Nobody knows this. I talk about it a little\nbit, but never probably, because why would I, I don't know. Why am I doing it now? I don't\nknow because I don't know. Because I am, because it's now, because it's now maybe, maybe because it's now, I don't know. So he sent this man that, you\nknow, obviously we both knew, and he said, here's the deal, Teddy, no talk about this, wants\nit to, you know, disappear, basically, you leave and he\nwill give you 5%, his word, can you imagine? He will give you 5% of\nTyson's earnings for the rest of his career. But I don't regret it one\nbit 'cause it wouldn't have happened anyway. See that's where I could be honest with my, people say, oh, stand up guy. Because I told him to shove\nit with the, you know, in that place, and tell Cus\nshove it in that freaking place. You know, I was mad. Teddy,\nTeddy, don't get angry. Don't get angry? Are you outta? You serious? Get outta here. Tell\n'em to go shove it over. And you know, my wife was like, huh. But, and then people like after, \"Why didn't you take the deal?\" It wasn't a deal. It was an escape clause for Cus, it was an insurance\npolicy that his, you know, that this kid wouldn't\nbe taken away from him. And thank God he wasn't, I\nwasn't gonna go and say nothing. They didn't have to worry\nabout, Cus forgot who I was? Cus forgot why he went to court for me? Because of those characteristics\nthat he said he loved and he noticed and that he admired? I didn't lose those... He\nforgot that that was me? He forgot who he was talking to? He didn't have to do that. How about that's why I told\nhim to shove it up his... Not because of the other insult. and then when people said to me, \"Oh, you a stand up,\" because\nit was around a little bit. It was around in the circles. And then when people,\noh, oh, stand up Teddy, he didn't care about the money. I said, stand up Teddy?\nWhat are you talking about? How about just realistic Teddy, how about I live in a real world that I was never gonna get that money. So I'm saying, I'm\nstanding up to something that I knew never existed. So I ain't stand up. Not in that way. I am in other ways maybe, but not, don't put a medal on my chest for that. Because that never existed. It was never meant to exist.\nBut he didn't even understand. That was the one thing that\nreally disappointed me in Cus. I was like, Cus, you really\nallowed this to get to you. Where you allowed it to\nreally fog up your thinking to the point where\nyou're smarter than that, you're better than that. That you would actually think\nyou gotta freaking offer me a freaking pieces of silver? You really think that? That's what you... Freak you! Like all that you told me that you love me and that we were, I was the young master and all this and you think you were gonna buy me? And I was gonna, and that\nwas gonna keep me quiet? How about I would keep quiet because I would always keep quiet. - So he thought maybe\nyou might betray him. - Isn't that interesting? Yeah. And why did he think that? No, no, really. - Fear.\n- Yeah. But yeah, fear is at the\nessence of everything, it is connected with everything. Fear of losing what he was gonna lose. But it was more than fear. It was him not believing in\nthe things that he told me he believed in. He didn't even know that. He believed in me because\nI was a stand up guy. because I didn't sell\nmyself, because I, you know, I didn't freaking turn\nevidence. I didn't make a deal. I didn't do... And that's why he went to court and that's why he stood up\nfor me and I appreciate it. And that was what he lived by and that was his, you know, those were the blocks of being a man. Oh, so much for those blocks. - Well it's like you said,\nloyalty requires, you know, he would've had to take a\nrisk on losing immortality that he would achieve by creating a great heavyweight champion. - 100%. But the only way you\never find out if somebody is really that... - It's hard, it's hard.\n- Is the test. And it was Cus. - This is Shakespearean. You know? This story. - Cus told me, Cus said, \"And it just come in different forms.\" I said, all right, Cus.\n- This was his test. - \"And some people pass this\ntest because they're able to pass that test because\nit's not really a test. Not for them because it doesn't\nspeak to their weakness. But it's the test that\nspeaks to the weakness. That's the one.\" So this one, I get it. I get what it spoke to, Cus. You know what, at the end of the day, I forgive you and I feel bad for you. I feel bad that you were put in that position after you\nlived your life that way. And that you taught that and you preached that from the mountaintops. That you had to be... That you had to be... I'm not gonna use the word, but that you had to fail\nyourself and that you had to somehow know that before you died. I just prayed that you didn't know that. And you still don't know\nthat because you were great. You were great. And you've given me some, you know, you've given me\nsomething to aspire towards, to try to be less weak, try to be better and try to be as good as you want it to be. I wish I can someday. More importantly, I wish I could make my father, you know, feel, just feel good up there. - You're a grandfather now. - Yeah. Four grandchildren. - What, if you can give\nhim advice on how to live a life they can be proud of? - Just... Do everything you can to the best of your ability every day. To like yourself. To\ngive yourself a reason. To actually say, I'd like\nto be friends with that guy. - Is loyalty one of the reasons, one of the things to aspire to? - Loyalty is your chance\nto have a fulfilled life. Loyalty is your chance to have strength, to have all the things you\nneed to have a good life, to be a good parent, be a good husband, be a good grandfather,\nhopefully be a good role model. Loyalty is... Loyalty is, if you could\nfind something to drink, to take into your body to\nmake you prepared for life, to be all the things that you wanna be, to be strong enough to be those things, loyalty would be the\nthing you would drink. And when I say loyal,\nI mean unequivocally. I mean, you know,\nunconditionally, not conveniently, obviously you know that. If you could be loyal, you\ncould be a good person, you could be a person that\nyou would actually like to be around. 'Cause you could be a\nperson you could rely on. And I think that's one\nof the greatest assets that a human being can have. - And what do you do when you're betrayed? How do you overcome that? - You think of what you learned from it. Use it as a roadmap to remember, and to think back of how you got there. And how you got to the\nplace where you got betrayed and how that person got to that place. Try to remember that in your own journey. - Has it, for you, made you cynical? Like how do you try, how do you take the leap of\ntrust towards people again and again after that? - Just by remembering\nthat I'm still trying to forgive myself for the things\nthat I came up short with. And if I haven't figured that out yet, it's probably okay to say they didn't figure it out yet. They didn't get it, they\ndidn't figure it out. And if I couldn't figure it out, and I'm still trying to figure out, maybe I could get over\nthat initial stabbing of what it feels like,\nit does feel kind of like a stabbing, that you feel when you're betrayed initially, and that you can only think\nof anger, revenge, hatred, and those things I'm not proud of that, but I felt all those things, you know, and I still feel 'em sometimes. And then I go back and say, hey, you're still working at forgiving\nyourself for some things. Try to remember that kid, you know, memory's an important thing. Forgetfulness is pretty important too. And try to remember why we forget. (laughs) Why do we forget? Because it wasn't something\nyou felt proud of. - You think about your death? Are you afraid of it? - You know, it's funny you asked that. I never used to think about it. I know people in both places, you know? - I know. You've got it covered. (laughs) You're gonna be all right. - Don't forget that.\n- Yeah. - I know people in both places. - Yeah.\n(both laughing) Both neighborhoods. - I... I've been given credit for being brave in certain spots in life. I hope I can be brave when it comes time to leave life. I hope I can be. You know, and that's, you know, that's as real and honest\nas you can be about it. I hope I can be, you know,\nso far so good. You know? When I've had to be certain\nthings that were scared to freaking death, I\nfound a way to beat them, for the most part. And so I figured when that day comes, I'll figure that out too. - [Lex] It's gonna be another test. Maybe the last one. Teddy, it's a huge honor to talk to you. - It's my pleasure. - Thank you for being the human you are. For being honest, honest about the full\nrange of human nature.
