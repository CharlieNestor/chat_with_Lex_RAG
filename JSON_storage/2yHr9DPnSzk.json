      "text": "- What's your opinion on\nmy bird here, Mr. Parrot? - It's a macaw, scarlet macaw. - What?\n- It is a scarlet macaw. - Oh. You know birds?\n- Yeah. And that's actually not life sized. - Are you saying he's not real? - I'm saying it's not to scale. - Okay. But he's real. - Are we doing that Monty Python sketch? (both laughing) - Everything is a Monty Python sketch. - I don't think Monty Python's funny. And I-\n- You don't? - At all, like, not-\n- That explains so much. - Does it? What does it explain? - What do you think is funny? - (laughs) But you not\nanswering that question, it's pretty funny. - Yeah. What do you think is funny?\nHaving a mantis shrimp? - No. - Do you think \"Big Lebowski\" is funny? - Oh God, no. - (laughs) This is\ngetting worse and worse. The following is a conversation with Michael Malice, anarchist and author of \"Dear Reader\", \"The New\nRight\", \"The Anarchist Handbook\", \"The White Pill\", and he is the host of the podcast \"YOUR WELCOME\".

      "section": "Beauty and mantis shrimp",
      "text": "- The box? - Yeah.\n- The mystery box. - I'm wondering what's in it. - There's something in that\nbox of exquisite beauty, both literally and in what it\nsymbolizes and why it is here. - Given the kind of human being you are, I'm terrified at what you find beautiful. - That's a good point. You kind of hit me with the curve ball. - Yeah.\n- Like for me, the most beautiful like wildlife are what I call God's mistakes. 'Cause my friend came up with that term where she's like, you know, God made these disgusting\nanimals, just threw in the bottom of the ocean. He is like, no one's ever gonna see this. - Yeah. You commented on Twitter\nabout some creature, like a rainbow type creature. - The peacock mantis shrimp.\n- Yeah. It's beautiful. - It's horrific though. So it has, I think, eight legs, six arms, two punching claws or spearing claws, depending on the genus,\ntwo eyes, two antennae, two ear flaps, I dunno what they do... And its punch can be\nas strong as a bullet. And the other type what the spears, divers\ncall them thumb splitters, because if you stick your finger near it, it'll cut your thumb down to the bone. So I had one as a pet. All night I would hear\nbanging on the PVC pipe. And I gotta tell you, they have the best eyesight\nof any animal 'cause they see in like seven different ways. And when you make eye\ncontact with this thing, it's just absolutely terrifying. But you can eat them as sushi,\nthey call 'em sea centipedes. - [Lex] But they're\ncolorful and beautiful. - [Michael] That's species is. Yeah. - What was it like having one as a pet, and why did you do it? - Well, when you have a\nspecies that's that unique and that much of an outlier, you know, growing up reading these\nbooks, watching these shows, I found this stuff so\nmuch more fascinating than like space and\nwhich is, you know, dead. So to be able to have this\nspecimen in your house and just observe its behavior\nis just like an amazing thing. - Why'd you get rid of it? - I didn't have, I guess, the\nright minerals in the mix... - It died? - It had a problem molting once. Yeah. They couldn't molt correctly. - Wow. Do you miss it? Think about it, still? - I do think about it to be honest. I still have a pair of its punching appendages\nfrom when it molted. - What pet animal in your\nlife do you miss the most, that has been in your\nlife, that you think about? - I've never had cats or dogs growing up or anything like that,\nwhich, you know, I, oh God. My problem is...\n- Here we go. - If I like something, I\nwill go down a rabbit hole. - Yeah. - So I know, if I got one tattoo, I already know my first\nfive are gonna be, okay? So I can't do it. 'Cause then, once I get those five, it's gonna be 100 and\nI'm already too old to be the tattoo guy. - What would be the first tattoo? My face? Would it go on your ass cheeks? Or where would you put\nthem? If it was my face. - If I got your face, it would definitely be\non my arm right here. - If you had multiple\nfaces, would you put like... - I think delts, right, shoulders, different faces on different shoulders? - And then when you...\n- The symmetry. - Yeah. Would you get a dictator? If you had to get a\ndictator, who would you get? - Have to be the Kim Jong Il, right? - [Lex] Hmm. - Because I wrote the book on him. - Oh. It's like the plugging your book. In the tattoo.\n- Don't think plugging. It's just like I have a personal\nconnection to this stuff. - It good opener to this conversation. But he would be asking why him, and then he'd be like, well,\nI wrote a book about it. He'd be like, okay,... - Okay. Here, here's why.\n- Check it out. - That would be a bad open. No, that's not what happens.\n- Okay. - Here's the thing.\n- What happens? - When you write a book about North... \"Hey, nice to meet you. What is you do?\" \"I'm an author.\" \"What kind\nof books do you write?\" \"Well, my last book was on North Korea.\" 90% of the time. 90. They will then start telling\nme everything they know about North Korea. And it's like, I don't\nneed, this isn't a quiz. And it's a very poorly understood country. I don't expect you to know\nanything. You're not on the spot. And half what you're saying\nis not accurate either. It's fine. - How often did they\nbring up Dennis Rodman? - 100%. - 100% of the time? - Oh, so do you know Dennis Rodman? - Yeah.\n- But I don't understand what, I guess people feel the\nneed to like, all right, like now we're talking about this subject. I just gotta, you know, drop\nwhatever I can talk about. It's usually a small amount. And there's this thing in\nthe culture, which I hate, that everyone have to have\nan opinion on everything. And it's like, it's okay to be like, yeah, I don't know anything\nabout that. Tell me more. You know, there's lots of things I don't know anything about."

What do you think is funny?\nHaving a mantis shrimp? - No. - Do you think \"Big Lebowski\" is funny? - Oh God, no. Although... - This is getting worse and worse. - To be fair...\n- Yep. - I only tried to watch\n\"Big Lebowski\" after it's been part of the\nculture for many years. - [Lex] Right. - To the point where every single line has been quoted incessantly by the most annoying frat bros ever. - [Lex] Yeah. - So I kind of have\nbeen poisoned to be able to appreciate it. - [Lex] Right. - So maybe if I'd seen\nit when it came out, before it became a thing,\nI would've enjoyed it. I couldn't get through it. Like I couldn't get through 20 minutes. - Is that how you feel\nabout \"Schindler's List\"? - Well... - It's so much easier for\nme to stare at you when you have sunglasses on. - I didn't think you'd be the one making Holocaust jokes today. (Lex laughing)\nAnd yet here we are. - And, cut scene. I actually have like no trouble\nmaking eye contact with you when you're wearing shades. - Yes. 'Cause you're a robot. - Two copies of myself.\n- Yeah. Oh, you're seeing yourself in them? - Mhm.\n- Okay, cool. - Yeah, I'm having a\nconversation with myself. It's not your fault, Lex. - (laughs) They made you like this. You were just a good little\nrobot in St. Petersburg. - I could see Mr. Parrot a little bit too. - But what do you find funny? Come on, this is an interesting subject. - Well, I find Monty Python,\nI find absurdity funny. - Yes. I find absurdity funny. I think that's the thing,\nwhen people come at me, and maybe this is an\nEastern European thing. - Yeah.\n- When they're like, how can you find this like\nvery dark subject funny? It's like, well, the humor, first of all, the humor is that you're making fun\nof something that's dark. So already it's absurd. Like\nit's completely inappropriate. Second, just psychologically, you know, Joan Rivers said that\nWinston Churchill said, I don't know if it's true, that when you make people laugh, you're giving them a little vacation. And I was just thinking\nabout this the other day, how when I die, if, I want\nmy funeral to be a roast. - [Lex] Yeah. - It doesn't help me that everyone's sad. If I brought people happiness\nor joy in life, whatever. I wanna keep doing that in death. Your sadness doesn't help me. I know you can't help it, but tell stories of how it made you laugh. Make fun of me. Make me the punching bag. Even literally take me outta\nthat coffin and beat the... I don't, make me a pinata. I don't care. So I think, and it's I\ndon't understand, well, I do understand, but it's\nsad for me when people are like, you know, this isn't funny. That isn't funny. The way I look at humor is the\nway it's like a chef, right? It's pretty easy to make bacon taste good. But some of these really\nobscure ingredients, to make it palatable, that's takes skill. So if you're dealing with a subject that is very emotional or intense and you can make people\nlaugh, then that takes skill. And that's the relief for them. - Yeah. It's all about timing. - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - [Michael] What's the difference, you wanna hear one of my jokes? - Is it a pirate joke? Because that's the only\nkind I accept today. But no, go ahead. It doesn't have to be a\npirate joke this one time. - Do you know who Lia Thomas is? - [Lex] Yeah. - What's difference between\nLia Thomas and Hitler? - What? - Lia Thomas knows how to finish a race. - Very nice. Very nice. - Did I just get the gold medal? Good job. - Why does it take pirates forever to get through the alphabet? - Why? - Because they spent years at C. - Oh, I thought it was\ngonna be an arr joke. - Nope.\n- That's a good one. I like that.\n- Yeah. - When I was in North Korea- - (laughs) Oh, you know Dennis Rodman? It's a callback. - By the way, the thing\nthat is very heartbreaking about the North Korean\nsituation is that they have a great sense of humor. It would be a lot easier if these were\nlike robots or drones. They have big personalities,\nbig senses of humor. And that made it much\nharder to leave and interact with these people. 'Cause I mean, there's nothing more human\nand universal than laughter and laughter's free. - Are you're saying\nthere's humor even amongst the people that have most of\ntheir freedoms taken away? - Especially, I mean,\nagain, we're from, you know, the Soviet Union. Like, there's anekdoty. Russian humor is a thing because\nthere's nothing you can... If you can't have food or nice things, at least you can have joy\nand make each other laugh. I think about it all the time. And I think about my guide all the time. It's been, what, 2012? So it's been 11 years\nsince I've been there. And she's still there. And everyone I've seen is still there. They just recently electrified the border, so even the few people who are escaping can't do it any more. - Well, that's interesting that they still have a sense of humor. I attribute the Soviet Union for having that because of the like really\ndeep education system. Like you got to read a lot of literature. - Okay.\n- And because of that, you get to kind of\nlearn about the cruelty, the injustices, the\nabsurdity of the world. - [Michael] Right. - As long as the writing is\nnot about the current regime. - Yeah. But I think like, if you look at like African Americans,\nJewish Americans, gay Americans, they are all disproportionate in terms of attributing to comedy. It's not 'cause these groups have some kind of, you\nknow, magic to them. It's that when you are on\nthe outside looking in, A, you're gonna have different\nperspective than the people who are in the middle of the bell curve. But also, when you don't\nhave anything to lose, at the very least you\ncan make each other laugh and find happiness that way. So, you know, that is\nsomething that I think is an important thing to recognize."

      "text": "- So what do you find funny? What makes you giggle like\nin the most joyful of ways? The suffering of others? - I mean, there are YouTube videos of like fat people falling down, and they're really funny. - There's two kinds of\npeople in this world. Those that laugh at those\nvideos and those that don't. - No. And those that are in them. (laughs) My friend Jesse just told me\na great Norm Macdonald joke. And this is a good litmus test joke. 'Cause he says, a certain\ngroup of people lose their minds and a certain group\nof people just stare at you. And he goes, and so\nI'll tell you the joke. This is Norm Macdonald. A guy walks into a bar and\nhe sees someone at the bar who has a big pumpkin for a head. And the guy's like, \"Dude,\nwhat happened to you?\" He goes, \"Ugh, you never believe this. I got one of those genie\nlamps and this genie...\" He's like, \"Well, what happened?\" He goes, \"Well, the first wish, you know, I wished for $100 million.\" He's like, \"Yeah, did you get it?\" He goes, \"Yeah. It goes in my bank account, feels fine.\" He goes, \"All right.\" \"Well, the second wish, I wish to have sex as many\nbeautiful women as I want.\" He goes, \"Did that happen?\" He goes, \"Yeah, it was amazing.\" He goes, \"Then what?\" Well, \"I wished for a giant pumpkin head.\" - (laughs) Yeah. - So there's a certain mindset\nthat will just be staring at the screen. And that is, I mean, there's so many levels why\nthat's funny, at least to me. And I just love that kind of... - Well, Norm Macdonald is like just, I watch his videos all time. He's a guy that definitely\nmakes me giggle. And he's one of the people\nthat makes me giggle for reasons I don't quite understand. - Did you ever see him with\nCarrot Top on Conan O'Brien? - No.\n- Making fun of Carrot Top? - [Lex] No. - This is probably the best\ntalk show clip of all time. He's on with Courtney Thorne-Smith. She was on \"Melrose Place\"\nand Coen O'Brien's the host. And Courtney's talking\nabout how she's gonna be an upcoming movie with Carrot Top. And Coen is like, \"Oh,\nwhat's it gonna be called?\" And she's like, \"Doesn't\nhave a title yet.\" And Norm goes, \"Oh, I know\nwhat should be called, box office poison.\" And they're all laughing\nand she's like, no, no, no. Like the working title is\n\"Chairman of the Board.\" And Conan goes, \"Do something\nwith that, smartass.\" And Norm goes, \"Yeah, board\nis spelled B-O-R-E-D.\" And they all just completely lost it. - There's something about\nhim with words spoken out of his mouth with the way\nhe like turns his head and looks at the camera... - I think he is one of\nthose rare comedians who you really feel like\nhe's talking to you directly. - Yeah.\n- He feels like he's winking at you-\n- Yeah. - In the audience. And he is like, can you\nbelieve I'm doing this? Like it's like he almost,\nhe feels like he's, I don't wanna say imposter, but like he's more a member\nof the audience than he's a member of the people on the stage. - Yeah. It feels like he's on our side. - [Michael] Yes. Yeah. - Whatever the hell our means. - You know Roseanne got him his first job? - Man, Roseanne, you and\nher been hanging out. - I got it. Oh my God Talk about Thanksgiving. When you are talking to Roseanne Barr and making eye contact with this person... It is, I can't even describe it. It's just like, holy crap,\nRoseanne Barr's talking to me. She is, I've said this to her\nface, pathologically funny. Like it does not turn off. And you're sitting there\nand you're like, holy crap. And when you make her laugh, which is that laugh\nthat's in the theme song of her show, you feel like,\nokay, I did a mitzvah, I did something good\nand right in the world that I made Roseanne Barr laugh. And it's also really funny because, and she's gonna hate this, 'cause I tell her she's\nadorable, she doesn't like that. She's little. You think of Roseanne\nBarr as this like force of nature, like a tsunami. She's like five three\nI'd say like maybe 130. Like, and she puts on the sunglasses, you think this little old\nJewish lady, you'd never know, this is one of the most\nepic performers of all time. She lives near here now. So it's just so much fun talking to her. There was an old\nsatirical magazine in the, I think like early 2000s\ncalled Heeb, written by Jews. And she dressed up as Hitler\nfor one of the photo shoots and she was baking little men in the oven. - Oh.\n- I got, I found on eBay. I wanted her to sign it, \"To Michael, it should have been you.\" But she signed it, \"To Michael,\nyou're one smart cookie.\" And now it hangs, \"Love,\nmom, Roseanne Barr.\" And I call her mom. And\nit hangs over my desk. 'Cause I have her like good domestic goddess energy flowing at me. What? - What do you find... What else? So Norm McDonald, Norm- - My favorite comedian is-\n- We agree on something. - My favorite comedian of\nall time is Neil Hamburger. So Neil Hamburger, I don't\nknow if I'm ruining the bit, he's a character performed by this guy named Gregg Turkington. So he comes out in a tuxedo, big eyeglasses holding\nthree glasses of water, (coughs) coughing into the mic. And I remember I saw him\nonce in LA and the girl ahead of me at the table ahead of\nme was with her boyfriend, this basic chick pumpkin spice. She turns to him and she\ngoes, \"What is this?\" And I remember the first\ntime he was on Jimmy Kimmel, and he tells one of his\njokes and it was like, \"Why does ET like Reese's Pieces so much? Well that's what sperm tastes\nlike on his home planet.\" And like no one laughs. And\nhe goes, \"Oh, come on, guys. I have cancer.\" (both laughing) And it just cuts to this\nmarine in the audience with his arms crossed. So if you know what he's doing, it's just absolutely amazing. He opened for Tenacious D\nonce in somewhere I think in Ireland or the UK, one of those. And they're booing him 'cause\nhis jokes are often not funny. He's like, \"Hey, where did\nmy whore ex-wife run off to with that dentist she's shacking up with? I don't know, but when I see her in\ncourt next month, Alaska!\" So they're booing and he goes, \"All right, do you guys want me to\nbring out Tenacious D?\" They're like, \"Yeah!\" \"Do you wanna see your heroes\nand mine, Tenacious D?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Come on, let me hear it. Do you wanna see Tenacious D?\" \"Yeah.\" He goes, \"All right, if I tell this next joke\nand you don't boo me, I'll bring out Tenacious D.\" And it's like, I'm trying to\nthink of one that's not too... - Self censorship is never good. - Okay. He goes, \"Can we agree that George Bush is the worst President\nAmerica's ever had?\" Everyone claps. He goes, \"Which makes it all the stranger that his son, George W.\nBush, was in fact the best.\" - I take it back on the self censorship. - (laughs) So two people\nlaugh and he goes, \"Oh, that's amazing. I guess I'll do an encore.\"\nAnd he did 10 more minutes. It was just like, I love him so much. - It's interesting he\nopened for Tenacious D. Jack Black, that's a comedic\ngenius of a different kind. - Oh yeah. And he was in one of my\nfavorite movies, \"Jesus' Son\", it's this little indie movie. He did a great turn in that. He's really underrated as an\nactor. He's got a lot of range. Like I know they kind\nof kinda get typecast as this kind of one specific type, but he's really, really talented. - But also just like the pure joy. - Yes. He's clearly having fun."

      "text": "- Okay. It is Thanksgiving. So in the tradition, following tradition, what are you thankful for,\nMichael, in this world? - I got... Do you have a list too? - No, not really.\n- Really? - It's up in here.\n- Oh, I mean, but you have several\nthings you're thankful for? - Yes.\n- Okay. - Yes.\n- One of the things I'm- - My list comes from the heart. I don't have to write anything down. - [Michael] Well, I\ndon't have written down. - Okay. - One of the things that\nI'm most thankful for, this is a common answer, but I\ncan back it up, is my family. Because my nephew Lucas is\nnow six years old, and he, when kids have a sense of humor,\nit's like just miraculous. So he stole my sister's phone, his mom, figured out that grandma is\nlisted as mom in the phone. And he calls her up and he's like, \"Michael's in the\nhospital, he's really sick. He didn't wanna tell you.\"\nAnd she's freaking out. He goes, prank! So I took him, Dinesh\nD'Souza just released a movie called \"Police State\", which was actually really\ngood, highly recommend it. I was surprised how much I liked it there. 'Cause he wasn't going\nRepublicans good, Democrats bad. It was just about authoritarianism. And he had a movie premiere at Mar-a-Lago. So I'm like, I gotta\nbring Lucas to Mar-a-Lago. So Lucas is, I'm like, we're\ngoing to the President's house. He's like, \"Oh, the White House?\" And I'm like, no, like a former president. He goes, oh, \"Abe Lincoln?\" And I'm like, okay, kid logic, like he's giving logical answers. This is kinda like AI,\nyou have to program it to, it's using logic correctly. - You should have told him\nis a president that's second to only Abe Lincoln in terms of greatness. - Accomplishments. Yeah. He went up to all the women in their ball gown, you\nknow, evening gowns. And he goes, \"You're so beautiful.\nWere you born as a girl?\" So when you have this six\nyear old asking you this, it was really, really fun. So that is a great joy to have a nephew, and I have another one, Zach, who's coming up in age and\nhe's starting to talk now. That is really, really fun for me. - Getting to watch them, you know, find out about the world\nfor the first time. - And also training them. Like, that he loves being\nfunny and having fun. - You're his audience in a sense. - Yeah... But-\n- 'Cause you giggle and... - We're prank bro's, he\ngives me a high five. My family... And this is one of... You\ntalk about what I find funny. This is things that actually enrage me. When people, and this\nis such a WASP thing, don't just go with the\njoke or they're like, I don't get it, or they don't\nunderstand to just go with it. I was in the car with my sister when she was like 10, 12, whatever. She's much younger than me.\nShe's like 12 years younger. And there's this species\nof squid, by the way, which is asymmetric, one of its eyes is very much bigger than the other, 'cause it swims horizontally,\nand so one's looking up, one's looking down where\nthere's more light. Shout out, if you wanna\nlearn more about squids, go to octonation.com.\n- Octonation. Shout out. - Shout to Warren. - There's a lot of fascinating stuff. Octonation on Instagram. - Yes. I was in the car with my sister. She's like 10 or-\n- Me as a pirate. I'm sorry for the rude interruptions. I appreciate that count, especially. - Yeah, it's a great, yeah. - These jokes and thoughts\nare coming to me at a, like a 10 second delay, so I apologize. - Okay. - Anyway, you were telling about the... - I know where I-\n- Asymmetrical. All right. - So I tell my-\n- Sometimes you need help. - No.\n- The age is getting to you. - (laughs) I was...\n- Your skin is showing it. It's getting dark. - I told my sister, I\ngo, when you were born, one of your eyes was bigger\nthan the other and you had to have surgery to fix it. So she turns, she's like, \"Mom!\" And my mom goes, \"Honey, the important thing is that you're beautiful now, that's all...\" It's like, what's the big deal? It was just a little surgery. And I says like, all right, calls grandma. And grandma goes, she goes, \"Michael said that I was\nborn one of the eyes...\" She goes, why is he telling you this now? It's not a big deal. You were... So the fact that everyone\nwent with this... - Oh...\n- I was so impressed. I was like, this is a quality family in this very specific regard. Does your family have a sense of humor? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah.\n- You know, Soviet culture, there's like a dark sense of humor. - Very much so.\n- There's... - Word play.\n- Word play. (laughs) Yeah. Yeah. And especially the Russian language allows for some like hilarity to it. There's also culture of\nlike poetry and like my dad, my mom too, but they remember a lot of\nlines from books and poems. So there's just, you can do a lot of fascinating references\nthat add to the humor and the richness of the conversation. - I feel like that's a very Russian thing. Like at a party or maybe\nat a bar or something, I don't know where you'd meet people. These are such great ice-\n- Go out. - I meant in Russia, I meant, these would be such\ngood icebreakers, right? You go up to someone goes, hey, did you hear this one anekdot? And you just tell him some little story. - Did you say icebreakers\n'cause it's cold in Russia? (Michael laughing) I'm here all night. - That's true. You never leave the house. - Literally.\n- So... I feel like that's a thing. - [Lex] Yeah. - And that's not a thing in America. - [Lex] You mean like witty banter? - No. Meaning you go up to stranger and like that's your icebreaker. You tell 'em this little joke. And since everyone kinda has the same sensibilities, right away, you guys are chatting. I don't think that's a thing here. - [Lex] Yeah. - Think here it's more small\ntalk, which drives me crazy. - So what else are you thankful for? - Well, what's something\nyou're thankful for? - Well, you went with family. I'm definitely thankful for family. - Okay.\n- Yeah. - How, if I may ask, how\ndo they react to you? Like, you're sitting down with Elon, you're sitting out with Netanyahu, you're sitting down with all\nthese like big, with Kanye, all these big names. Are they expressing that\nthey're proud of you? Or is it more like, why haven't\nyou talked to this person? - (laughs) Yeah. More\nMichael Malice, please. - (laughs) The people's choice. - Yeah. Yeah. They're very proud. They've been very, I mean, but they get argumentative and we just, they're just like a regular human being with whom I'm close and\nwe just argue about stuff. They're not, maybe not enough\nshow the being proud of, but that part is just the\nnature of our relationship. It's also Soviet parents. - Yeah. I don't talk to my dad. That's one of the reasons, 'cause there's never ever any good job. And at a certain point\nit's like, why am I trying to search for approval from someone I'm never gonna get it for? And from who it wouldn't mean\nanything at this point anyway. - Well, that's interesting. I mean, there's a journey\nlike that for a lot of people with their father or with their mother. Like they're always\ntrying to find approval. And that's life for a lot of people. - [Michael] Yeah. - That's a really big part\nof the human condition is that relationship you\nhave with your father, with your mother. I don't know, it's a beautiful thing. So it's, whether it's\nbeen a rough childhood or a beautiful one, all\nof it, that's who you are. Like that, the relationship, especially early on in\nyour life with your father, with your mother, is\nlike extremely formative. - Yeah, my dad taught me a\nlot of things at a young age that I'm very, very grateful for. He's extremely intelligent, very flawed. And that's fine. We\nall are, except for me. And it's the kind of things\nthat when you learn things at a right age, and this is one of the things\nI like about being older, is that when I'm friends with people- - Much older.\n- Much older, when I'm... But much, much older, When I have friends who are younger, it's very easy for me\nto keep them from making the mistakes I did. So at least this is something\nI'm getting out of it is that, okay, I can't fix these mistakes, but it just takes me 30\nseconds and I can pull you back from making the mistake. So he taught me a lot as a kid. He really encouraged me very much to, he has a very good sense\nof humor and also very bad in some ways. Dad jokes, but also really funny jokes. But also this love of learning\nthat I got that from him. And I mean, I have got\nliterally right now 98 books on my shelf to read. It's just a life... That makes me, I remember\nI had a friend and she ran into someone she went to high school with and he stopped you on the train and he is like, yo, you're not in college. You don't need to read books any more. And I was just like\nhorrified to hear this. - Yeah. Yeah. Boy, don't I know it. - I mean, you do laugh, but like, there's a lot of things\nI don't understand. When you got heat for like, I wanna read the Western classics, to me, that might've been like the\ninternet at its absolute worst. - I think there's just a cynical perspective\nyou can take that there. This is such a simple\ncelebration of a thing that there must be something behind it. I think the internet, for good\nand bad, is just skeptical. Like, what's behind this? - My hero, Albert Camus. And if there's one thing I would\nwanna fight, it's cynicism. Because it's such a giving up... It's such, everything sucks. This sucks, that sucks, this\nsucks. Most things suck. Most standard comedians\nsuck. Most movies suck. All podcasts suck. But it doesn't matter. - Especially yours.\n- Especially mine. It's unwatchable.\n- \"YOUR WELCOME\" He can't even spell it correctly. - (laughs) But the stuff\nthat's good is what matters. Who caress if 90% of movies are terrible, like they're the ones that\nchange your life, the books, the people, the comedians,\nthe shows, the music... - And even the terrible things have good moments, beautiful moments. - [Michael] Some, not all. - Your podcast being\nan example of not all. I've literally just, I keep listening for something good, something good. - In all fairness, none of my\nguests have anything to offer. That's not on me. I try. - Yeah. Well, I wish you'd talk a\nlittle less in your podcast. It's a little excessive. I only listen for the\nunderwear commercials. - Sheathunderwear.com,\nprobably called Malice. - I think you did this, I haven't seen you do it in a while, but this kind of commentary\non a debate or I think it was with Rand, like an Ayn\nRand debate or something. - Oh yeah. Malice at the Movies. I watched the video and I broke it down. - [Lex] That was really great.\nI wish you did that more. - I haven't done live\nstreaming in a long time. It was something I was doing a lot in New York, especially during COVID. I feel that, I don't know, I got so many projects\non the plate, I'm, oh, this is something else I'm thankful for. This is something I'm very, very thankful for and I'm\ngonna announce it here. - [Lex] Coming out of the closet. Finally. Go ahead. Who's the lucky guy? (both laughing) - You're the one in drag. - Guns out. Guns out.\n- He makes me- - The sleeves off.\n- He makes me call him Sex Friedman. - (laughs) You like it. - So... I didn't say it. - All right.\n- Didn't even imply that. When I, in, as you\nprobably know, as you know, but as many people\nwatching this also know, Harvey Pekar who had\nthat comic book series, \"American Splendor\" was the subject of movie \"American Splendor\". He wrote a graphic novel about me in 2006 called \"Ego and Hubris\", which\ngoes for like $150 on eBay. It's not worth it, just download it. And I met Harvey because\nI wrote this screenplay about this band from the\n'80s called Rubber Rodeo. It's a real band. And the keyboardist, Gary\nLeib, who passed away, rest in peace, Gary, introduced me to Harvey\n'cause he did the animation for the movie. And this script's been in\nmy desk for over 20 years. And I realized, thanks\nto my buddy Eric July, who has some huge success with his comics, I could just produce\nthis as a graphic novel. So I've got an artist,\nwe're getting it together, so I'm gonna make it happen finally. And it's some of the best\nwriting I've ever done. I'm really proud of the story. It's kind of ironic reading it now, because when you're a writer, obviously, different books, you put different aspects of yourself into them. Right? And this story's very, very dark because basically they did all the right things and they went nowhere. Right? And what I realized was reading it now that all these fears I\nhad over 20 years ago about what if I'm not gonna make it? What if, you know, I'm doing all the hard work\nand it's still not enough? Now it's been disproven 'cause\nI can at least pay my rent. - You feel you've, like, you've made it, 'cause you said you could pay your rent? - I feel that to make it is if you don't have to have a boss, and you know how I really\nfelt like I made it? This is gonna sound like\na joke and it's not. This is being an immigrant. I own, as you know, Margaret\nThatcher's bookcases. - Yes.\n- So to me, as an immigrant, to have her bookcases in\nmy house, I've made it. - You are right. It's not a joke. - It's not, there's nothing\nfunny about it at all. - Not laughing.\n(Michael laughs) It's time to get serious. - Oh, nice. Oh, now I'm\nmore nervous and aroused. So what else are you thankful for? So we're both thankful for family. - I mean, I'm, the fact that I can... - Still get it up?\n- What's that? - Nothing, go ahead. - I think as an author, to be able to write what\nyou want and have of enough an audience that it covers your living... That's as good as it\ngets as an author almost. You don't need to be\nStephen King or some legend. It's like, you know, there's lots of standups who\naren't like world famous, but they have perfectly good\nliving, they do their gig, they do what they love. I feel very, very blessed. But you must be thankful for your career. - Yeah, yeah. Career-wise... But like, I think the best part about it's just meeting, making friends. - Okay.\n- With people I admire. - Okay, cool. - Quite honestly, just friends. I, you know, the people\nthat have gotten to know me, I hide from the world sometimes, I hit some low points,\nespecially with this new, all the new experiences\nand just the people that have been there for me\nand haven't given up on me. - You know, there's days, and I'm sure you've had this also, where like, I literally don't speak\nto someone the whole day. And in certain times of\nmy life, it's really, I remember very vividly, I was in DC in '97, I was an intern, and that summer, DC closes\ndown on the weekends. And I remember those\nweekends when like I got off the phone with like the\nthird person, I knew there was no possibility anyone was gonna call. And what that felt like. And\nit was dark and it was bad. So I remember those feelings\nof loneliness like a lot. - I still feel alone like that sometimes. You don't feel alone? - Not any more. - What's the reason, you think? - There's like, I have a lot of people who I care about\nand who care about me. I mean the thing about\nmoving to Austin is I forgot how lonely New York got, because it was like one after\nanother I lost everybody and then you start losing\nthe places you go to. And then it was just like,\nholy crap. I'm very isolated. And here in Austin there's\nnot as much to do, obviously, as in New York, but there's\na lot of people here. More people are coming all the time. So if I ever want to like hang out with someone, you know,\nI've got a long list. And these are people who I've\nknown for a very long time. People who know me quite\nwell. So I could be myself. My awful, awful, awful,\nawful, awful, self. And that is something\nI don't take lightly. - Now you moved to\nTexas, it's gonna secede. - Yeah.\n- It's just a very... - Do you know what happened with that? - [Lex] No. - I forget the guy's name. And it's probably for the best. Monday, on Monday, a guy in the Texas legislature\nintroduces a bill to have it on the referendum, to have\na referendum for Texas to declare its independence. Tuesday I'm on Rogan.\nMe and him discuss it. I give it national attention. It was also really funny\nbecause a lot of people are like, \"These people have been in Texas five minutes, blah, blah.\" I go to the Texas legislature,\nmeet with the guy, have a nice conversation. A month or two later, unanimous, I think, he gets voted, kicked out\nof Congress because he got an intern drunk and was\ninappropriate with her. At least it was a girl in this case. But yeah, so it's like, that was my little Texas\nindependence moment. - Oh. It didn't go anywhere? - It did not go anywhere.\n- Wow. - But it's still part of the platform of the Texas Republican Party. - Yeah. It's fascinating that\nhistory is probably laden with stories like this of\nfailed revolutionaries. We celebrate the heroes, but\nthen there's the losers like... - Myself. - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - And we're gonna mark\nthat one as a failure and edit it out. And moving on. So, thankful... Yeah. Friendships. Right. But by the way, I wanna say just to you, I'm thankful in this\nlonely moments for people who write books. I've been listening to audiobooks\na lot and reading a lot. I really like audiobooks actually. And just like, I don't know, I can just name random\nperson, Serhii Plokhy, he's a historian, I'm reading on the... - Wait, I read him. What do you, what do-\n- I just, he written a book most recently about the Russia-Ukraine war. - He wrote another one that I read. Didn't he write about-\n- Empires, I think? - The fall of the Soviet\nUnion or something like that. - Yeah, yeah.\n- Yeah. It was very, very good.\n- He's great. It's true. - I used him as a resource\nfor \"The White Pill\". - He's objective, while still having\nemotion and feeling to it. Like he has a bias... - [Michael] That's fine. - But without, a lot of\ntimes when you write a story that involves Putin, people\nare really ideological. - Yeah.\n- They don't really like, they don't write with a\ncalmness and the clarity and the rigor of history. There's emotion in it. Like there's almost a virtue signaling. - Yeah.\n- And he doesn't have that, even though he is Ukrainian\nand has very strong opinions on the matter. Anyway, there's people\nlike that and he's done an incredible job\nresearching a recent event. Like he says, I was looking at everything that's been written\nabout the war in Ukraine and realizing, you know,\nthe old Churchill line, that historians are\nthe worst ones to write about current events\nexcept everybody else. And so he is like, I might as well just write about this war. And he does an exceptional\njob summarizing day by day the details of this war. Anyway. So I'm just grateful\nfor a guy like that. - So for me there's,\nI'll name some historians I love, Arthur Herman, Victor Sebestyen is probably my favorite, David Pietrusza, P-I-E-T-R-U-S-Z-A. When you are a historian, and I tried to do this to some degree in \"The White Pill\", as far as I could. But yeah, when you take data\nand you make it read like a novel, so you're learning about who we are as\npeople, what had happened, but also it's entertaining and readable... That to me is like the acme of writing. And I have so much admiration... - What does acme mean?\n- Top. - Okay. - Zenith.\n- Zenith, okay. This is what writers do? They just come up with these\nincredibly sophisticated words? I'm impressed. - Well, acme's-\n- Because you could've just said the best of writing. - Acme is also the\ncompany in like Bugs Bunny and Wiley Coyote is always\nAcme, you know, Acme? - Yeah.\n- Yeah. Like Acme bombs. When they are that good, it's\njust it leaves me in awe. Ron Chernow is another one.\n- Who? - He wrote the Hamilton biography. - Oh, nice. Oh, I have a lot of favorite historians about the whole time period of World War II, William Shirer, people that lived during it, especially, I really like those accounts. Obviously Solzhenitsyn\nis, he's not a historian, but his accounts are Fascinating. You actually, how much do\nyou talk about Solzhenitsyn? - Never.\n- Not much. Right? Why not? - I feel like I wanted to... There's something I could add to him. - [Lex] Oh, he didn't, he's the Michael Malice\nof the previous century? - No, he's talented,\ncharismatic, and skilled. So he is not the Michael Malice. Yeah, I did not, I feel like I didn't... I didn't read \"Gulag Archipelago\"\nfor \"The White Pill\". I feel-\n- You didn't? - I didn't. No. I feel I got a lot of\nit from Anne Applebaum, who's a very controversial figure. Her history books on the Soviet\nUnion, I think, are superb. But she's also accused of\nbeing very much like a neocon and being a war monger\nin contemporary times. - [Lex] Oh, I see. - And I think comparisons\nbetween Putin and Stalin, although there is a Venn diagram, I think are a bit much, because I think it's very\nhard to claim that, you know, if Putin conquered Ukraine,\nthat there'd be a genocide. I think that's a very\nhard argument to make. - In these tense times, even the comparisons of\nwhat's going on in Israel, on either side, comparisons\nto the Holocaust are also troubling in this way. - Yes. And I also don't like how that term... You know, I got in trouble, there was some literal demon who works at The Atlantic and... - As opposed to a regular demon? - As opposed to figurative demon. - I didn't know they employ demons. - They exclusively employ\ndemons at The Atlantic. And he was giving me crap\nthis a couple years ago on Twitter because I didn't\nthink it's appropriate to refer to George Soros\nas a Holocaust survivor. And I'm like, listen, if you wanna put him in the same context as Anne Frank, knock yourself out. But I think that's so\ncompletely disingenuous and frankly repulsive to me, morally, to equivocate between figures like that. And also to claim that\nanyone who is a billionaire who is, including Elon,\nincluding Sheldon Adelson, there's no shortage of these people, if you wanna use your extreme wealth, use it to influence politics, you have to be up for criticism, and to protect people, Bill Gates, protecting these people from criticism just on the base of their\nidentity is deranged to me. - But also the Holocaust\nas a historical event, and the atrocities within it\nare just singular in history. - Right.\n- And so comparing them... - What's the utility? Right? You're just basically\ntrying to take this brand, I'm using that term, you know, in a very specific way and latch, like when they say climate denial, no one's denying climate exists. So you're just trying to\ngo off of Holocaust denial. I think it's shameless\nand I think it's gross. - And it cheapens everything.\n- Yeah. - 'Cause there's deep important\nlessons about the Holocaust. - Yes. - To me the lessons are about\nhow extreme it can get... - And how fast.\n- Yeah. And how fast. - That's the one. So, you know, people ask, oh,\nare humans basically good? Are they basically evil? I always say they're basically animals. And I think people are, most people are almost\nfundamentally deranged. And that there's basically this veneer of civilization and decency. And when shit hits the fan, and we see this over and over, they do things that would've been\ncompletely unthinkable even to themselves five years ago. - Most people are fundamentally deranged with a veneer of civility... - [Michael] There's a show called... - I Think I disagree with that. - [Michael] Well, what's the show called? I'm having Alzheimer's 'cause of the advanced age.\n- The age... The skincare...\n- There's a show called, \"I Think You Should Leave\". It's a sketch show.\n- I think you should leave. Okay. Sorry. - It's a sketch comedy show. And he captures these great...\nHow's your hair, princess? He captures these great\nmoments of just the, like, just the very thin veneer\nof normalcy and just the craziness that's so\nfrequently lurking underneath. Another great example of this, when this is dealing with\npeople who are literally crazy. Have you ever seen the show \"Hoarders\"? So every episode of\n\"Hoarders\", there's two, usually two people in every episode, but every episode has the same plot line. Veneer of normalcy, veneer of\nnormalcy, veneer of normalcy, slight expression of concern,\nfull blown derangement. And it always follows that exact pattern. - Yeah. I don't know. I think the deep\nocean of the human mind is... Is good. Like there's a\nlonging to be good to others. - I have seen literally\nno evidence of this. And I know everything's a deep ocean with you people, but like... - What do you mean you people? - Pirates? - Oh.\n- I don't see it. - What's that Mr. Parrot?\nHe's an antisemite. No, that's not nice to\nsay in front of such a large audience. You're embarrassing me, Mr. Parrot. - Lex, you have-\n- What's that, Mr. Parrot? - You have-\n- He's a run of the mill troll and barely an intellectual? That's not nice to say. That's not true. We talked about this. You have\nto see the good in people. - You have seen personally...\n- Yep. - How quickly and easily\nit is for human beings to form outgroups. - Yeah.\n- And to just read others, just as I just did a minute ago with The Atlantic, completely\nout of the human race. And that happens\nconstantly and very easily. Humans are tribal beings. So that does not, I don't see how that's compatible with this essential desire to do good. - No, I think it's like\nin 1984, the two minutes of hate, there is a part\nof humans that wants to be tribal, and wants to\ndirect, get angry and hateful. And then that hate is easy to direct. By especially people as\nyou, as an anarchist talk about there are people in power, they- - Yes.\n- Direct that anger. But I think if you just look\nat recent human history, the desire for good, the communal desire for good\noutweighs that, I think. Like most of life on Earth right now, people are being good to each other, in a most fundamental sense, relative to how nature usually works. - Okay. I think you're both wrong\nabout people and about nature. So nature is not inherently\nviolent in the sense, like for example, if\nanyone has an aquarium or if you look at wildlife, yeah, you're gonna have predator or prey. But these animals are gonna be coexisting and they're gonna be ignoring\neach other for the most part. Right? And as for humans, you know,\nbeing essentially good, I think humans are essentially,\nto each other, you said, I think they're essentially\ncivil and amiable, but that's not really being good. - Good, I think, is a thing that gets illustrated when you're challenged, when there's- - Yes.\n- Difficult situations. - Exactly. Yes. - I mean, civility is\na good starting point. And then when there's a\nbig challenge that comes, people step up, on average. - I completely agree with\nyou that human beings are capable of such profound\ngoodness that it kind of makes you extremely emotional. And I certainly think that that's true. But I think that that's more\nunusual than it is the norm. - I see beauty everywhere. - So do I. But that doesn't mean\nit's in every person. - Not in every person, but in most people. I think, I mean, I wish there was a really\ngood way to measure this. My general sense of the world is just, there's so much incredible of\nboth in terms of economics, in terms of art, in terms of just creation\nas a whole that's happened over the past century that\nit feels like the good is outpowering the bad. - You just did the\nperfect segue to the box."

      "text": "- What's in the box. - So...\n- Is it your fragile ego? - That's my, you stole my joke! You stole my joke! That was the joke I made\nat you before we recorded. You stole my joke! - No, no, I didn't. I write all your material, you hack. - (laughs) So, as you know, I have a lot of beautiful\nstuff in my house. 'Cause I think it's something very\nimportant, everyone listening. If you accomplish something that is great, some achievement, what I like to do is buy myself something\nto remember that moment. 'Cause sometimes when it's hard, you forget you've done\ngreat things in your life, you've had accomplishments. It doesn't have to be\nsome amazing factory. It could just be like\nmy first job where I got a raise or, you know what, I... Anything. So there's this amazing sculptor\nnamed Jake Michael Singer, a singer who's a sculptor. And I saw a piece of his-\n- How's his singing voice? This is, joke's not gonna-\n- Hold on. I could go somewhere with this. - Okay.\n- How's his singing voice? - Do you want me to\nwrite your joke for you? - Yeah. What's the punchline? Hard. (both laughing)\nThere it is, that's... - That's what she said. - So I followed him on\nInstagram, he followed me back. And he is like, if I made, he says, what's the point of being\nan artist if this work I create isn't in the spaces\nof people I like and admire? He's a big fan of yours.\nYou've given him... And our episodes together give him joy. So he said, if I make Lex a sculpture, will he put on the shelf behind him? And what that reminded me\nof is when I was a kid, you read Batman comics\nand there's the Batcave. And the Batcave has all\nthis cool stuff in it. I didn't realize until much later that all of those things in the\nBatcave had an origin story. - [Lex] Hmm. - So the giant penny, the dinosaur, there was actually a story\nwhere that came from. So if you're a fan of a\nshow, you can spot, oh, this is when this appeared,\nthis is when that appeared, this when that appeared. So he made you this sculpture, he lives in Turkey and it's\ncalled \"Chance Murmur\". And it is, I haven't even seen it yet. It is absolutely beautiful. - All right, this... So you wanna do a little unboxing? - Yes.\n- Okay. Axe or? - Body spray.\n- (laughs) All right. - Let's do it.\n- Let's unbox. - I'm so excited. Hey, Lex has got a box. (both laughing) - You know that Steven Segal\nmovie where there's like a stripper that comes outta the box? - Is there...\n- \"Under Siege\"? - Okay.\n- He's on a boat. You're not an action film guy. - No. - One. What does the pirate say when he turns 80? - What?\n- I am 80. - Aye matey. Oh. (both laughing) - [Lex] Oh. See that's how\nI know you don't like humor. - I just don't like pirates. - [Lex] Well, your mom does. Do you play any musical instruments? - No. Neither do you. I've seen\nyour guitar videos. (laughs) - Okay. Here's a big piece of wood for you. That's what it feels\nlike, just so you know. - Oh wow. - You need help?\n- Yeah. - Oh my God. - This traveled across the world. - So here's why his work\nspeaks so much to me. So first of all, he's combining so many\ndifferent references. It's Nike, the Goddess of Victory. Right? It's that it looks like an angel as well. The Italian futurist, which is my favorite art movement from the early 20th century, they tried to capture\nmotion in 2D or 3D form. - Well, Jake, thank you,\nthank you, thank you, thank you for creating beautiful things. And I thank you for caring\nabout somebody like me and somebody like Michael,\nwho really feels the love. - That's the other thing.\n- Thank you. - When you have something\nthat matters to you in your house and you're having a bad day, you can look at it and\nremember, you know what I mean? That spirit of joy. And I\nactually have a list here. - Okay.\n- I got a little rant ready? Do you wanna hear my rant?\n- Yeah, let's go. You're... - One of the things that drives me crazy is when people, especially conservatives, think that all contemporary\nart is ugly or abstract or like literally garbage. And there's a lot of that. But so much of the stuff\nout there in galleries is not only not crazy expensive, but they're trying to sell\nthings for people in their house. And these are young artists, you know, they're trying to add beauty. I have a list, so if you don't believe me and you think all\ncontemporary art is garbage or terrible, go to the\nwebsite or any of these places that I'm gonna rattle\noff, look through them, and you're telling me that it's not about creating beauty and joy\nand things in people's lives. So I don't have any relationship\nwith any of these people. These are just some galleries\nI follow on Instagram. Outre Gallery, Antler Gallery,\nGiant Robot 2, Beinart, I dunno how to pronounce it, I'm sorry, B-E-I-N-A-R-T,\nSpoke Art Gallery, Var Gallery, Milwaukee, I was there. The pieces were not expensive at all. - What kind of art are we\ntalking about? Everything? - Mostly paintings. Mostly paintings. Some\nsculptures too, like this. Corey Helford is my favorite one in LA. Night Gallery, Vertical\nGallery, Avant Gallery, Hive Gallery, Haven Gallery,\nand Curio Art Gallery. I'm telling you, it's not exorbitant. This is not the kind of\nthing where you have to go to museum and be like, this\ndoesn't make sense to me. You look at it right\naway, you're like, okay, I know what this is. And it's beautiful. It's awesome. And you're supporting someone who's young and creative trying to do\nsomething and make the world a better place. So I'm a big fan of the\ncontemporary art scene. A lot of it is not great, but even the stuff that's not great is very rarely disgusting or gross. It's just like, okay,\nI've seen this before, or something like that. - [Lex] Okay. - It's like the difference between, there's like a standup\nwhere like I'll pay money for the ticket and someone's\nlike, who's an opener? It's like I wouldn't\npay to see him perform, but he sure still made me laugh. That person is still more,\nby far more good than bad. So a lot of this art\nisn't stuff I would own, but it's like, okay, I get it. I like it. - Well, as the analogy goes, I really like going to open mics actually, because like, it sounds absurd to say, but funny isn't the only\nthing that's beautiful about standup comedy, it's the act, the... - [Michael] Yeah- - No, it's going for it,\nit's trying to be funny, it's taking the leap, trying to joke and some of the best stuff is actually funny, but the audience is like three people, two of whom are drunk and bored and\nyou're still going for it. And that's like, that's the\nhuman spirit right there. - Roseanne was telling me how\nGilbert Gottfried would go on. It was like three in the\nmorning and it was like five, her and like three other\ncomics in the audience. And like, they all were just dying. Like he was just killing them.\nWho's your favorite comedian? - Dave Smith. - Who? - And cut scene. Favorite comedian, first Norm McDonald, if you like put a gun to my head and I had to answer really\nquickly, that would be him. - [Michael] Okay. - I would also say Louis C.K.. - Oh wow. Yeah. Oh my God. Yes. - But that's almost like a\nvanilla answer at this moment in history because it's like... - Louis C.K.'s pretty radioactive. - He is. Well, he does it... The tough topics- - Sure.\n- The best. Mitch Hedberg. The wit of\na good one-liner is great. I guess that's what Norm\nMcDonald's genius is at. - [Michael] Yes. - What about you? - There's a, I mean, we're so fortunate to be here in Austin because like Comedy Mothership, you go there and like\npeople are just killing it. David Lucas is amazing. - Thai Rivera, Thai Rivera probably did the best set I've seen since I've been here in Austin. And I watched him, and\nI'm like, this guy's even bitchier than I am. So I reached out to him.\nSo he's just terrific. David Lucas is another\none. A buddy of mine. - You just said a choice, I think. - [Michael] I'm thinking,\nDave Landau. Excuse me. - Yeah.\n- Dave Landau. Joe Mackey.\n- Old age catching up. - It's true though. - It's true.\n- It's true. - It's true.\n- Dave Lucas. - You ever been to the Comedy Mothership? It's a great spot. - Where is that? Is that in Austin? - Austin? Is that where Willie Nelson's\nfrom? I haven't really. Go ahead, I'm sorry. - Oh, I heard a joke\nabout that the other week. What's the-\n- Tell a joke again. - What's the only thing\nworse than giving head to Willie Nelson? - What? - If he says, I'm not Willie Nelson. (both laughing) - What's that Mr. Parrot?\nI know he is not funny. He thinks he's better on Twitter, but that's not nice to say\nright in front of his face. Just think about how he feels. - The statue Chance Murmur is judging you. - Chance?\n- It's called Chance Murmur. - Chance Murmur. - God, that's so beautiful. - That's gorgeous. - This is another reason I hate cynicism and I talk about this a lot. Even just on Etsy, there's so many small, not huge companies, like\nindividual artisans, who are creating great stuff\nand just making it happen. And it's really sad for me\nwhere people can't see that. Or if they're like, well how could I be\nexcited about a sculpture when blah-blah-blah the Middle East? And it's just like, you can always look for an\nexcuse not to look for joy, or you could look for an\nexcuse to look for joy. - Yeah. That's incredible. I feel the same way about OnlyFans. I can't even get that outta\nmy mouth before laughing at my own failed joke. - That's what she said.\n- Edit. Oh? All right. That might be one of the\nfirst that's what she said from a Michael Malice. - Yeah.\n- I'm gonna count that. - I don't know what\nI'm gonna do with mine, 'cause I got my own, mine's\nthree feet tall, just like me. - Your box was much bigger.\n- Yeah. - And it was giving me\nan inferiority complex. I think I'm gonna invade Russia. (Michael laughing) That's a Napoleon reference\nfor those in the audience. - I don't know if I'm gonna,\nI think I'm gonna put it in my bedroom so that\nit's the first thing I see when I wake up. - Put in the bedroom?\n- Yeah. - Do we get through\neverything we're thankful for? - No. I've got lots of\nthings I'm thankful for. - What else? Friends, family... We said books. - I'm thankful for career. I am thankful for... I am thankful for, and I know people are\ngonna lose their minds and I can hear them flipping out already, I am thankful for social media. - Yeah.\n- For several reasons. First, it is a way for\npeople to make connections that they couldn't have\nmade in years past. That if you got some weird hobby, you can find that other\nperson's weird hobby and you make that connection. It's a great way to stay\nin touch permanently for people otherwise\nyou'd lose touch with, you know, whatever venue. And it's also a great\nway to expose corporate depravity, when you\nhave these organizations that are dishonest, I think\nthe Community Notes thing on Twitter is the greatest thing ever. - Ah, that's incredible. I wish they would pay attention to the Michael Malice account more often. - You shouldn't be encouraging\nanyone to pay attention to my Twitter account. - Yeah.\n- It's a dumpster fire. And I don't mean Bridget, I mean like a literal- - Bridget, by the way, is amazing. But your Twitter account-\n- She lives here? - Yes. Not here. I wish she did. - She's in Georgetown. - No, I mean in this,\nwhere we're sitting... - Oh.\n- It's a joke, Michael. - Is it?\n- Yeah. - But I'm just really glad about, it's another way for people who before would've felt very alone. I know it makes some people do feel alone, but for other people, it\nmakes them feel connected. - There's been a lot of talk\nabout antisemitism recently. - [Michael] Yeah. - What's your sense\nabout this? Is there... Is antisemitism like\nany other brand of hate? There's a lot of hate out there. - No, I don't think it's\nlike any other brand of hate, because I don't\nthink racists or transphobes or homophobes or misogynists\nor xenophobes argue openly or even not so openly for the killing of black Americans,\ntransgender people, gay people, women or immigrants. And it's not only something\nthat's talked about, it's something that has actually happened. And not just the Holocaust,\nbut just centuries of pogroms. Right? There's this great book\nthat I read many years ago called \"The Satanization of the Jews\", Camille Paglia recommended\nit and I read it. And they live in this certain\nspecific kind of antisemitism. And I'm, again, I'm not talking about people who are\nagainst Israel or something. I'm talking specifically about Jew hatred. They have this moral calculus that Jews are the only people who are\ncapable of good or evil, and Jews are exclusively capable of evil. And for example, if you\nlook at the George W. Bush White House, you had W, you had Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Colin\nPowell, Donald Rumsfeld, a lot of these neocon advisors. So if there's 10 people in a room and there's one Jewish\nperson, it's his fault, and the rest are Jew controlled. So again, they only\nexist as a puppet of Jews in this kind of worldview. And it's like that, to\nme, if there were no Jews on Earth, it is crazy\nto say that John Bolton and Liz Cheney and Lindsey\nGraham wouldn't be pushing for more war. That makes no sense to me. It's like, you blame the\nJews when bad things happen. But when a Jewish person\ndoes something good, it doesn't really matter. Or just wait. He's gonna do something bad. Well, yeah, that's true. Human beings do good things and then they do bad things sometimes. But it only counts when\nthat Jewish person does the bad thing. - I wonder what's a way\nto fight antisemitism and fight hate in general? - I think the only, or the best way, 'cause I thought a lot about this, about how did gay Americans go from being universally hated\nand despised to the point that many people in the\n'80s went to their graves, those who had AIDS without even telling their parents, 'cause they were so scared to now Times Square is just\ncovered in pride flags. And I think, and this also\nworks for Islamophobia and some of these other\nbigotry is what I call the ambassador program. Because as soon as you know\nsomeone who is a member of a certain group, it is a lot harder to\nbe bigoted against them. Because instead of this\nbeing this outgroup that's somewhere out there,\nit's like, wait a minute, I work with this guy, yeah, he's kind of a jerk and\nmaybe he sees things a little differently than me, but this guy is not a\nhorrible human being. So I think the only way to\nfight any form of bigotry is to be a good example of the counter to these whatever archetype or\nstereotype is in the culture."

      "section": "Karl Marx and religion",
      "text": "- Karl Marx wrote that\nreligion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the\nsoul of a soulless condition. It is the opium of the people.\nAs the famous phrase goes. Do you think he has a point? - No, I hate that quote. I absolutely hate it. I despise this sort of Reddit\ninternet atheist activism for the simple reason\nthat I know many people, who in finding faith, have become objectively\nbetter human beings. They start living consciously. They take morality seriously. They try, we all fail,\nto be moral good people. So this sneering that these midwits, these marginally intelligent people have towards religious people... Now lots of religious people use religion to rationalize their bad\nbehavior or, you know, sinful or big ego so and so forth. That exists. That's true. But to say that it never helps anyone and it's universally the... See, Marx was talking\nabout a period, I mean, I'll defend his quote, when\nhis argument was, you know, the masses are being\nstarved and oppressed, but they're promised, don't worry, you'll have riches in Heaven. So you should kind of like, let yourself be pushed around now. And this is kind of this\nBS bargain that the people are being given. So that was, I think,\nthe point he was making. It certainly doesn't apply nowadays. I'm close to the family in the Midwest. They're good Christian people. I remember very specifically\nthis guy, shout out to him, Sean Sherrod, I\nwent to college with him, David Lucas, and... - Have you checked out\nthe Comedy Mothership, great, great club.\n- Where is it? Is it in Austin?\n- Willie Nelson. - And I, you know, I was 17, 18 freshman year and I was\nreading all this criticism of the Bible and I was like,\nlook, this is in there, look at this in there. And he put his hand on my shoulder and he says, \"Michael, there's nothing you're\ngonna tell me that's going to make me lose my faith.\" And that was a very self-aware\nand profound thing to say... As I've gotten older, I know\nlots of religious people. There's no part of me\nthat thinks they're wrong or they should be mocked. It's like, it also reminds\nme of when people sneer at addicts in recovery, they're like, \"Alcoholism isn't a\ndisease. It's a choice.\" It's like, wait a minute. You don't know what it's like to have your entire life\nruined by drugs or alcohol. And if you have to tell\nyourself, you know, I have this disease and blah blah blah, and that keeps you from drinking and now you're a moral, upstanding\nperson who's reliable and then takes responsibility\nfor their actions, I don't see the harm at all. So I think this kind of\nactivist atheism is cheap. I don't agree with it whatsoever. And I do not like that quote at all. - But otherwise, big fan of Marx. - I mean, I think there's a fan of mine. I forget who it was. Apologies. He had this great quote. He goes, and this is me talking. He goes, the games people\nplay to feel smarter than others is depressing and annoying. And I think this kind of\nfedora internet atheism is a good example. 'Cause here's the other thing. If you've proven that\nsomeone else is stupid, that doesn't mean you're smart. You could both be stupid. So congrats. You prove someone else\nis stupid. Who cares. - Yeah. And sneering in all forms. - [Michael] Yes. - In general is just not great. - That's one of the\nthings I block out people on social media instantly. You're not gonna sneer at me in my space. You could sneer me all\nyou want in your space, but I'm not putting up with your crap. I don't know you. - MySpace, great social network. - Is that on Sixth Street? - AOL.com. (Michael imitates beeping) That's how Lex comes. (both laughing) - Like a Pavlov's dog, that was the sound before you get to see, spend 10 minutes waiting\nfor an image of a lady load, one line at a time. (imitates monitor) I recently talked to John Mearsheimer, I dunno if you know him at all. So he has this idea\nabout offensive realism. It's a way to analyze the\nworld, international relations. And the basic idea, and I'll run it by you\nand see what you think is that states, nations want to survive and they try to do so by maximizing\npower, military power. And he talks about anarchy\nquite a bit in that one of these underlying assumptions\nof this way of viewing the world is that states are\nanarchic towards each other. - Yes, that's true. - And they operate under\na lot of uncertainty. States cannot be sure that other states will not use military capabilities against them. - Right. - They want to survive and they want to use military power to\ncontrol the uncertainty to protect themselves. - So I disagree in that regard. And I see on your bookshelf, I think the world is a lot\ncloser to \"Brave New World\" than it is to \"1984\". And I think it is, if you look at, let's suppose China's\ninfluence in America, right? The influence is far\nmore through soft power than military power. China doesn't threaten\nAmerica through, you know, we're gonna kill you. It's more like the infiltration of universities, TikTok,\nthings of that nature. Maybe this would've worked\nbefore the pop culture era. But I think one of the\nreasons we have this kind of American hegemony isn't just a function of American military. I think it's much more a function of American popular culture. When you're exporting ideas and culture, it makes other people in\nother countries feel closer to you, and also regard you as a friend, and also to adopt your values. It's a great way to spread propaganda. - It seems to correlate though, right? It's interesting. It's an interesting idea\nwhat has more power, the viral spread of ideas or\nthe power of the military? It seems that the United\nStates is at the top of the world on both. - [Michael] That's true. - And so it's hard to disentangle the two. - Let's look at Europe. American culture is very\npopular in Europe in many ways. Right? Like the best music comes out\nof Sweden, Swedish indie pop. They're singing in English. You know, even though so on and so forth. None of this is a function, maybe it's a function of post\nWorld War II to some extent. But I don't think it's a\nfunction of American bases there. I think it's a function of\nwe're exporting our music, our TV shows, and our movies. - Yeah. It's interesting. If the battleground will\nbe \"Brave New World\", the battle of ideas. - I think it's clearly,\nit's so much cheaper. And again, this is one of the\ndark sides of social media, to use influence than\nit is to use threats. I don't think, I think COVID\nis a good example of this. Like, so much of the pressure, yes, there was authoritarianism,\nbut it was the fact that everyone bought into\nit, rightly or wrongly, but the vast majority of the\npopulation was behind all of these things. And that was through\npersuasion, not 'cause... And 'cause people are\nbegging for it to come back in many cases. - So who's funding you?\nWhich intelligence agency? - Mossad.\n- Mossad, Mossad. This is how you do great interviewing. See, he didn't even\nexpect that. (chuckling) Okay. - What's that, Mr. Parrot? - Mr. Parrot. You knew it, but you didn't\nhave any documentation, did you? - I think Mr. Parrot is\nthreatened by the better wings, not a Chance Murmur. - He gets like that when he is turned on. - Oh. Okay.\n- He's not threatened. You can't wait until he's, all three of us are alone together. It's gonna be one hell of a party. - Beaks and feathers everywhere. - And metal."

      "text": "Yeah. This thing's beautiful. - [Michael] It's ridiculous. - You have actually a\nlot of really cool stuff at your place. - [Michael] It's so fun. - What's a cool thing\nthat stands out to you? Maybe a recent edition. - So I went to the Dallas\nMuseum of Art last year for my birthday. And there was a painting\nI liked and I Googled it and I saw the auction\nfor that exact painting. And it was like, I think three grand, which is not cheap, but not something... You think in a museum, I can never afford\nsomething like this, right? So when I was in, I went to\nHouston with some friends, the Sideserf, Natalie,\nwho made the cake of you. - Oh yeah. Cake terrified my mom. - Did it?\n- Yeah. - [Michael] Oh... - [Lex] No, it's not the\ncake that terrified my mom. It's you, Michael Malice, cutting it off, cutting the face off\nand laughing maniacally. - Well, Natalie's pregnant. She's gonna have a daughter named Daisy. So congrats to Natalie. - [Lex] Congrats- - But I was in the museum with\nthem and they was a statue of Thoth who's the Egyptian\ngod whose head is an ibis. It's a bird with a long beak. And Thoth is the god of\nthe Moon, god of knowledge, and supposedly he invented writing. So I thought, you know what? I've always loved ancient\nEgypt. I know a lot about it. And especially the mythology. It'd be really cool as an aspiring author to have an ancient Egyptian\nThoth statue in my house. Well, it turned out that\nthe Egyptians also killed and mummified ibises and\nburied them with scribes. And a week after I went to the museum, there was an auction for an ibis mummy. And I have it now in my house, still in its bandages, overlooking my desk. And we all know, it's gonna come to life\nand peck out my eyes. - Yeah.\n- And write with my blood. But that is one of the\nrecent cool additions. Another thing I have,\nwhich is like, in terms of holy crap, I've made it, I have an original Patrick Nagel painting, and if people don't know the name, he's like the '80s artist. He did \"Duran Duran\" cover. Whenever you see in nail salons. I have a male, which were\nvery rare for him to do. So that's two of my\nkind of favorite pieces. - You have what? - He only drew women predominantly. I have one where he drew\na male, like it was a guy in a, like a jean hat or something. - Hmm. - And now I'm looking forward to, so Jake made me a three foot tall sculpture\ncalled Future Murmur, which I am ecstatic to get. - Just remind yourself\nhow many fascinating, beautiful people that are out there? - And just the victory and\nholiness and technology and speed and how many\npeople have, you know, fought so that I could do what I do. - Yeah. That's another thing I'm grateful for. Just like the 100 billion or\nso people that came before us. - Yeah. - And also the trillions of life forms that came before that. - Oh God, I've gone down this trilobyte\nrabbit hole, buying fossils. 'Cause as a kid I thought\ntrilobytes were the coolest thing. And I've got like 15. - Yeah.\n- And what's interesting is when you buy trilobyte fossils on eBay, they're listed as used, (laughs) because it's gotta be\nnew or used and according to the programming, so it's used. Yeah. - Yeah. But just look, thinking\nabout all that history, just all the life forms that came before, it seems like a really\nspecial thing we have going on Earth here. - Oh, yeah. I think that that's very fair to say. But I also think this\nkind of is like live life to the fullest. You know, Camus talked about\nliving to the point of tears. - [Lex] Yeah. - Especially on behalf\nof people who didn't have that privilege. So, you know, I dedicated\n\"The White Pill\" to my parents who got me out of the Soviet\nUnion and all the kids who never could. And it's like, when I\ndie, I want everyone else to not only, they're obviously\ngonna be happy, but yeah... Like, I'm not here.\nEnjoy, you live for me. 'Cause I can't have\nthat privilege any more."

      "text": "- What do you think\nabout Camus as a writer? - I don't like his novels at all. - Oh, you don't?\n- At all. - Yeah. You've talked shit about \"The\nPlague\" to me a little bit. - Yeah. I think the book is pointless. - It's fascinating... - Because all you need to\ndo is read the synopsis and then you get it. Like, I don't think his book-\n- Isn't that true for most books?\n- No. - I mean, like, you\ncould take, I don't know. I just don't agree at all. I mean, it's \"Catcher in the Rye\". There's a lot of books seem trivial. - I don't think it seems trivial, but I think-\n- \"Animal Farm\". - \"Animal Farm\" is a methodical\nstep-by-step examination of a transformation from\none thing to another. \"The Plague\" is not that. - It's a methodical\nexamination of what a society is like under the plague, which could symbolize a lot of things, including the plague\ndirectly or Nazi Germany or ideological movements or... It's similar to \"Animal Farm\". Maybe not as effective in terms of using this kind of symbol. - I think \"Animal Farm\" has a narrative, and I'm gonna spoil the whole \"Plague\". The book \"The Plague\".\n- Okay. - There's a town I believe in Oman, a plague descends, people\nstruggle to deal with it, and the plague vanishes\nas quickly as it came. The end. - Yeah. But there's the victims, the people that take advantage of it, there's the doctor that amidst\nthe absurdity and the evil of the plague is fighting to do good. - Nothing from me. There's nothing for me. - Okay. Well, I could spoil \"Animal Farm\". There's pigs, there's\nanimals at a farm, (laughs) and the humans are abusing them. And then the animals overthrow the humans. But then the pigs become\njust like the humans. The lesson, kids, is that power corrupts no\nmatter whether you walk on four or on two. - I thought the lesson was that pigs are the most human-like\nanimals on the farm. - I thought the lesson was that there's no sugar candy mountain. - That's right. (laughs) - You've interviewed a lot of people. - [Michael] Yeah. - What have you learned getting\nto the soul of a person? The soul of an idea? From interviewing. Just how to do a good interview? - First off, I'm not\ninterviewing just random people. I'm interviewing people\nwho are accomplished. It's not a random group\nthat's self-selecting for something different. But I think that people love to, and this is very understandable,\nlove to feel seen. So if you're someone who's done something, even if you're like the\nbest guinea pig breeder in America, to have someone\ninterested in your work, and listen to what you're saying... 'Cause I remember every\nbook I've written, you know, I have friends that I wouldn't stop\ntalking about, you know, the person I'm writing with or, you know, the North Korea and at a certain point, I'm sure they're like, all right, I don't care about this any more. But like, it takes over your\nbrain. You know what I mean? So if you, someone who has\nan interest or a hobby, I'm sure to some extent\nmaybe your friends or family are sick of talking about\nit or you don't wanna talk about it with them, you wanna have, that's the private life where\nyou could just be yourself. So I try to, and this comes from my co-authoring\nbackground, when I'm talking to people, to ask the questions that they haven't heard before. There's a possibility that\nthis actor I'm a huge fan of, is gonna be on my show. I don't wanna spoil everything. And he's got a very specific\nrole that he's known for. And I know I'm gonna, I'm\nlike, okay, I'm gonna, I know it's gonna be\nannoying for you talking about this one role, but my goal is to ask\nquestions you aren't sick of, haven't been asked. - Porn star or? - No, not a porn star. - That joke failed also... Edit out. What do you know\nabout breeding guinea pigs? You mentioned it. I'd love to hear. - [Michael] I don't know anything. - I would love to hear more about it. - This is, I always\nuse this as an example. I said, you meet someone at a party who breeds guinea pigs. Right? There's two approaches. Either you're weird, get it? Okay. Or sit down and tell me everything. - Yeah.\n- And I'm very much, and all the people I like\nare the second group. When you meet someone who's\ndoing something unusual and are passionate about\nit and, you know, are good at it, like that to me is the mother lode. - Yeah. That to me also is the\nthing I enjoy the most is like, people that are passionate about- - Because it's who you guys hate? Do you guys hate the hamster people? Do you hate the rabbit people? There's gotta be someone\nthat you guys look down on. Because like the marine\naquarium people look down the freshwater aquarium people. - Yeah. It's a hierarchy.\n- Yes. There's always gonna be a hierarchy. This is where the left\nanarchists and I disagree. 'Cause they think you\ncould have egalitarianism. There's gonna be a hierarchy. - Hierarchies emerge.\n- Yes. - There's no anarchy in\nthe guinea pig world. - [Michael] No. It's just a\ndifferent kind of anarchy. - Somebody's always\nbreeding somebody else. - [Michael] Yes. - And looking down on the others. - If someone's the other. - [Lex] Yeah. - Whether it's the hamster\npeople, the rat people... - And everybody's breeding.\n- Yeah. - Hmm. By the way, are you an anarcho-capitalist? What flavor of anarchist are you? - [Michael] I'm an anarchist\nwithout adjectives. I like them all. The black\nflag comes in many... - All right. All right. You're quoting your own... No, I understand you. It was a beautiful line in the book. - Thank you. I think the anarcho-capitalist don't give the left-anarchists enough credit, especially for their courage. And I do whatever I\ncan in my power to talk about people like Emma\nGoldman, whenever possible. - Do you still think that\nare some people better than others is a good litmus test? - Yes. It's worked 100% of the time. - And for you the answer is yes. - I never answer. - Oh, there's two of them. - (laughs) They're... What, are you getting\nall Hitchcock up in here? - Oh hey, careful. I always got your back. What little habits in\nyour life make you happy, now that you're in Austin?\n- Oh my God. I was prepping for this\ninterview and I imagined this coming up and I knew\nthat as I explain this, you know how sometimes\nwhen someone tells a story, like at first it's\namusing, then it's amusing and concerned, and\nthey're like, holy shit, like where's the exit? - [Lex] Yeah. I'm getting nervous already. - You should. So I'm gonna tell you something I've told only a couple of people. This is my absolutely off the charts autistic approach to shaving. - [Lex] Oh. - So I have this insane system. You asked about habits that gimme joy. I used to hate shaving. I used to hate it. There's something called wet shaving. So wet shaving is, you get the brush, you get the soap that's in a canister. You stir it up, you paint\nyour face and then you shave. The thing is, there are dozens of these shaving soap companies. - Yeah.\n- Okay. So I tried a couple of\nhundred of these soaps. 'Cause you're testing for scent, you're testing for with\nthe lather thickness and also how smooth of\na shave it gives you. - [Lex] Yeah. - I have it down. I'm not making this up.\nI'm not this creative. I have it down to a cycle of 67 soaps. - Yeah.\n- Okay. - So a cycle?\n- A cycle, so 67. - Yeah.\n- When I use up one soap, that is a slot that I\nwill have to try new ones and I will try new ones in\nthat slot until I get one that I like, and then that slot is filled. So right now I have 67 that I\nuse and I have 86 that are... - Candidates. Like in queue. - Candidates.\n- Yeah. - In the queue.\n- Do you label 'em? Do you remember like which one is which? - Well, they all have beautiful labels. I mean, these are artisans who are creating these amazing things. So I would encourage everyone to try this hobby who's a guy. It's so much fun. I will give shout outs to the\ncompanies that are the best. So the best company, in my opinion, is a company called, they just changed the\nname because you know what they're originally called? I'm not joking.\n- Yeah. - Grooming Department. (laughs) And now it's like... - It's not a bad name.\n- Yeah. But it has certain connotations\nin contemporary discourse. - Yeah. Understand.\n- So now he changed- - Contemporary discourse. - He changed his name to\nAion Skincare, A-I-O-N. That's the sense of\nthe most sophisticated, the most diverse... And the soap is just really high quality. Another amazing company\nis Barrister and Mann, and if I'm gonna tell you to\ntry one, it's called Cheshire. He comes out with new\nones every month or so. A lot of it's miss, a lot of it's hit. Just great, great quality stuff. Another great company is Chiseled Face. They make something called Midnight Stag, which basically smells like a garage. It's one of my favorite soaps of all time. - Yeah. What makes for good\nsmell for Michael Malice? - I've 67 answers. So someone that- - [Lex] So you can't put\ninto, convert it into words. - Some are citrusy, some\nare industrial, some... - So garage is more industrial. - It smells like a garage. Yeah. Midnight Stag,\nit smells like garage. Some are fun 'cause they're smells that smell like other things. For example, there's a scent in my queue called Finding Scotty. It smells like Swedish fish. Another great company is Phoenix Shaving. And they have one called Aloha SmackDown. Smells like Hawaiian Punch. They had one called\nYule Ham that they made for me special, smells like a ham. They had a ramen one, Rock and Ramen, smells like cup of noodles. So they're great, and every year they do an advent calendar where you, for 12 days, you have a\nlittle sample of a soap and a sample of the aftershave. - Nice.\n- So those are, I'm forgetting someone\nand I'm feeling angry that I'm doing it. But those are some of the, oh,\nand Caties Bubbles is great. They're vegan, out of New Jersey. They've got one called\nKneehigh to a Grape. It smells like grape soda. I think those are the biggest\nnames off the top of my head. - Will that list converge down\nto a small set eventually? Or no? 67 down to... - Well, no, it's down to, it's 67, so... - Oh, so it always keeps... - Right, so if there's a slot\nthen, you know what I mean? Like, I'll fill that.\nYou see what I'm saying? - Oh, so you'll forever\nhave the variety of 67? - [Michael] Yes. - Huh. You know what, you know\nhow sad my brain is? When you were telling me this, I was like, I wonder how many soaps are\nleft in Michael Malice's life. Like, you can count your\nlife by days, by months, by years, or by soaps. - That is depressing. That is very dark. - Because each experience of shaving is a little beautiful experience. - [Michael] Yes, it is. - And how many do you have\nleft in your life, right? - That's true.\n- Yeah. - I gotta tell you,\nthere's something else. There's a term called, my\nfriend Jackie taught me called touching pan, it's a makeup term. So basically when you\nuse it and you could see the bottom, that's like a big moment. - Oh, it's a great thing?\n- Yeah. It's like what's kind of fun? I'm telling you, like people can scoff, it is such a fun, and there's a lot of us online who are into this whole space. It's really, really fun. - When did you first discover this? - Can I curse?\n- Yeah. - Fuck you Cole Striker. Because I was staying at my\nfriend Cole's house in LA. - Yeah.\n- Fuck you Cole. - Fuck you, Cole. - Cole is like one of the\nbiggest hipsters I know. He's got the shirts with the\npearl snaps and everything. And I'm staying at his house\n'cause I was doing Rogan. And he goes, \"Oh, have you heard\nof this wet shaving thing?\" And he goes, \"Look, this one's Proraso.\" That's like the Italian grandpa soap, which is also a great one. And I went down this\nrabbit hole and I'm like, I don't even know how many,\nhow much money I spent on this. And it's all 'cause of him. - Oh. But it's like a happy fuck\nyou, like, fuck you, Cole. - Yeah.\n- I love you Cole. Fuck you. - Yeah, it's just...\n- Thank you. - Yes. - That's a good idea for a tattoo. Fuck you, Cole.\n(Michael laughing)"

      "text": "Do you have advice on how to be happy? - Yes. - There's a lot of loneliness\nand sadness in the world. - Here I can give a very easy\npiece of advice that worked a lot for me. Instead of telling yourself that you have these ridiculous\nstandards, tell yourself, I can be better. Right? I don't have to be a great writer. I could be a better writer. I don't have to be a great podcaster. That will never happen. I\ncould be a better podcaster. I could be a better person. I\ncould be a better at the gym. I could be better with my time. And when you regard things in those, and especially if you have\nmetrics that you can go by, you know, I'll run this many miles a day. Things you have control over. Especially as males, when you have this chart\nand the data's telling you you're improving, right away it's like you have this sense of accomplishment. So I think that is a\nreally great way to... And if something is not\nworking in your life, let's suppose you don't\nhave friends, right? There's the internet. How\ndo people make friends? Try things out. What's the\nworst that's gonna happen? You're gonna, things will\nblow up in your face? Well, you'll learn something at least. Don't be afraid of making mistakes. When I was a kid, I was so scared of having\nthings under control, so like, I would never have to get hit\nin the face, metaphorically. And then I realized, and\nyou realized this as well, everyone who's important\ngets hit in the face, look at the president,\nwhoever the president is, it becomes a matter of being strong enough that you could take\ngetting hit in the face. So that is a big important\nswitch in your thinking. - Yeah. There's a Bukowski\nquote I wrote down. \"Sometimes you climb out\nof bed in the morning and you think, I'm not going to make it, but you laugh inside\nremembering all the times you've felt that way.\" - [Michael] Yeah. Yeah. - There's a part of me that's like that. There's some days where I feel\nlike this is the worst day of my life. And then like shortly after, I\nthink, like, chuckle at that. - Yes. - Like just knowing the\nups and downs of the brain and the mind and life and all that."

But when I think of depression, I think of someone who feels\nbad when things aren't bad. Like, to me, it's like almost by\ndefinition, irrational. - Well, yeah. And there's different kinds of, like, there's a exhausted kind of\ndepression where you're not... - [Michael] Right. - It's not so much sad as you're not, don't wanna do anything. You don't want to live.\nYou don't want to... - What's the, yeah.\n- What's the point? What's the point?\n- It's a wrap. Yeah. - And like an extreme\nself-critical negativity, which I'm also scared of, 'cause my brain is generally\nvery self-critical. - 'Cause you're not\ntaking enough magnesium. - Do you take it rectally or in the mouth? - You take a rectally. - [Lex] Okay. - But as for the magnesium,\nyou should take it as a pill. - Okay.

You know what, I mean in terms of, I'm scared of increasing authoritarianism, but that's not personal\nand that's something that I don't think is as much of an imminent concern as\nlike, let's say, in Canada. - Are you scared of death?\n- No. - You think Camus was scared of death? - No.\n- He just accepted it as... - Look, I can, I honestly feel like if I died tomorrow, I did pretty good with what I had.

The Russian upbringing like expects everyone to be like, just, it's a time bomb before the betray. You have been betrayed. Of course. Yeah.\n- Yeah. You value loyalty? - I do. And I also made it a point to not let that betrayal color my future\ninteractions and regard that as the universal or the norm. - [Lex] Yeah. - I think that's very important. - Me too.\n- And also I feel bad. I've gotten Lex enough that\nI feel bad for the person who betrayed me, because it's just like, they didn't need to do this. And at some point, if you\nbetray someone, you know, and you know you're not a good person. I believe that. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like, even if you tell\nyourself there's something I had to do, you still know you had to\ndo a bad thing to someone who didn't deserve it. And that's a really hard pill to swallow. - In my situation, I still think good thoughts and empathize with the people that have done me wrong. - I don't empathize with them,\nbut I sympathize with them. - My English is not good\nenough to know the difference. - Empathizing means you're\nputting yourself in their shoes. Sympathizing means you feel bad\nfor them and wish them well. - Yeah. I wish them well. - Yeah. But I don't put myself like, it's very hard for me to\nempathize with someone who betrays someone that they care about. 'Cause that is something, it's not that just I think\nI'm such a great person. It's that I feel guilt very strongly. So if I did that to\nsomeone who trusted me, I would really, it would fuck\nup my head for a long time. - Yeah. But maybe they were in pain,\nmaybe they were desperate. Maybe their back's to the wall. - Sure.\n- They felt that way. - Sure. Well, that's the sympathy thing. Not really an empathy thing. - Yeah. Yeah. Loyalty is a fascinating thing. - Yes.\n- I value trust a lot. - I know you do. Especially 'cause you're in\nsuch a public, both of us, we're, you know, very public positions. You have to be very careful\nwho you surround yourself with. - It sucks.\n- Does it? - It sucks because it's hard to... I usually just trust everybody. - That's... Okay, that's crazy. - [Lex] But what's the alternative? - To be, have a filter? - Well, I have a filter in\nterms of who I interact with. - [Michael] Okay. - But within the, you know,\nI see the good in people, but then you, in the very rare\ninstances that might turn... - [Michael] Okay. - And yeah, it just\nsucks. It breaks my heart. - Yeah. I hear you. I completely agree. - Has your heart ever been broken? - Yes. - Love?\n- Yes. - I'm just so relaxed right now. - Good.\n- And happy. Relaxed and happy. - Good. - This is making me really happy. It's so, again, it's beautiful on like\neight different levels. - I think that's the deepest\nthing I'm thankful for. It's just how beautiful\npeople are and how beautiful the world is. - I really, and people are gonna laugh and I welcome it, that's fine. I really sometimes feel like the guy in \"American Beauty\" looking\nat the plastic bag dancing in the wind and he's brought to tears 'cause of how much beautiful life is. And a lot of people feel the\nneed to sneer at that scene. And Ricky Fitts, whatever. And I think he's got it exactly right. - I think he does too. Well, in the end, you and\nI'll be both laughing. - That's exact, and right. And also seeing beauty where\nother people see garbage. And I'd rather be the\nperson who sees beauty than the person who sees garbage. - Yep. Well, when I look at you, I see beauty, when most people see garbage. And it's really unfair, Mr. Parrot, that you keep saying that. But all jokes aside, man, I'm really grateful for your friendship, and I'm really grateful\nfor you are as a person.

And that's actually not life sized. - Are you saying he's not real? - I'm saying it's not to scale. - Okay. But he's real. - Are we doing that Monty Python sketch? (both laughing) - Everything is a Monty Python sketch. - I don't think Monty Python's funny. And I-\n- You don't? - At all, like, not-\n- That explains so much. - Does it? What does it explain? - What do you think is funny? - (laughs) But you not\nanswering that question, it's pretty funny. - Yeah. What do you think is funny?\nHaving a mantis shrimp? - No. - Do you think \"Big Lebowski\" is funny? - Oh God, no. - (laughs) This is\ngetting worse and worse. The following is a conversation with Michael Malice, anarchist and author of \"Dear Reader\", \"The New\nRight\", \"The Anarchist Handbook\", \"The White Pill\", and he is the host of the podcast \"YOUR WELCOME\". This is a Thanksgiving\nspecial of the pirate and oceangoing variety. So once again, let me say\nthank you for listening today and for being part of\nthis wild journey with me. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Michael Malice. - The box? - Yeah.\n- The mystery box. - I'm wondering what's in it. - There's something in that\nbox of exquisite beauty, both literally and in what it\nsymbolizes and why it is here. - Given the kind of human being you are, I'm terrified at what you find beautiful. - That's a good point. You kind of hit me with the curve ball. - Yeah.\n- Like for me, the most beautiful like wildlife are what I call God's mistakes. 'Cause my friend came up with that term where she's like, you know, God made these disgusting\nanimals, just threw in the bottom of the ocean. He is like, no one's ever gonna see this. - Yeah. You commented on Twitter\nabout some creature, like a rainbow type creature. - The peacock mantis shrimp.\n- Yeah. It's beautiful. - It's horrific though. So it has, I think, eight legs, six arms, two punching claws or spearing claws, depending on the genus,\ntwo eyes, two antennae, two ear flaps, I dunno what they do... And its punch can be\nas strong as a bullet. And the other type what the spears, divers\ncall them thumb splitters, because if you stick your finger near it, it'll cut your thumb down to the bone. So I had one as a pet. All night I would hear\nbanging on the PVC pipe. And I gotta tell you, they have the best eyesight\nof any animal 'cause they see in like seven different ways. And when you make eye\ncontact with this thing, it's just absolutely terrifying. But you can eat them as sushi,\nthey call 'em sea centipedes. - [Lex] But they're\ncolorful and beautiful. - [Michael] That's species is. Yeah. - What was it like having one as a pet, and why did you do it? - Well, when you have a\nspecies that's that unique and that much of an outlier, you know, growing up reading these\nbooks, watching these shows, I found this stuff so\nmuch more fascinating than like space and\nwhich is, you know, dead. So to be able to have this\nspecimen in your house and just observe its behavior\nis just like an amazing thing. - Why'd you get rid of it? - I didn't have, I guess, the\nright minerals in the mix... - It died? - It had a problem molting once. Yeah. They couldn't molt correctly. - Wow. Do you miss it? Think about it, still? - I do think about it to be honest. I still have a pair of its punching appendages\nfrom when it molted. - What pet animal in your\nlife do you miss the most, that has been in your\nlife, that you think about? - I've never had cats or dogs growing up or anything like that,\nwhich, you know, I, oh God. My problem is...\n- Here we go. - If I like something, I\nwill go down a rabbit hole. - Yeah. - So I know, if I got one tattoo, I already know my first\nfive are gonna be, okay? So I can't do it. 'Cause then, once I get those five, it's gonna be 100 and\nI'm already too old to be the tattoo guy. - What would be the first tattoo? My face? Would it go on your ass cheeks? Or where would you put\nthem? If it was my face. - If I got your face, it would definitely be\non my arm right here. - If you had multiple\nfaces, would you put like... - I think delts, right, shoulders, different faces on different shoulders? - And then when you...\n- The symmetry. - Yeah. Would you get a dictator? If you had to get a\ndictator, who would you get? - Have to be the Kim Jong Il, right? - [Lex] Hmm. - Because I wrote the book on him. - Oh. It's like the plugging your book. In the tattoo.\n- Don't think plugging. It's just like I have a personal\nconnection to this stuff. - It good opener to this conversation. But he would be asking why him, and then he'd be like, well,\nI wrote a book about it. He'd be like, okay,... - Okay. Here, here's why.\n- Check it out. - That would be a bad open. No, that's not what happens.\n- Okay. - Here's the thing.\n- What happens? - When you write a book about North... \"Hey, nice to meet you. What is you do?\" \"I'm an author.\" \"What kind\nof books do you write?\" \"Well, my last book was on North Korea.\" 90% of the time. 90. They will then start telling\nme everything they know about North Korea. And it's like, I don't\nneed, this isn't a quiz. And it's a very poorly understood country. I don't expect you to know\nanything. You're not on the spot. And half what you're saying\nis not accurate either. It's fine. - How often did they\nbring up Dennis Rodman? - 100%. - 100% of the time? - Oh, so do you know Dennis Rodman? - Yeah.\n- But I don't understand what, I guess people feel the\nneed to like, all right, like now we're talking about this subject. I just gotta, you know, drop\nwhatever I can talk about. It's usually a small amount. And there's this thing in\nthe culture, which I hate, that everyone have to have\nan opinion on everything. And it's like, it's okay to be like, yeah, I don't know anything\nabout that. Tell me more. You know, there's lots of things I don't know anything about. - What's your opinion on\nmy bird here, Mr. Parrot? - It's a macaw, scarlet macaw. - What?\n- It is a scarlet macaw. - Oh. You know birds?\n- Yeah. And that's actually not life sized. - Are you saying he's not real? - I'm saying it's not to scale. - Okay. But he's real. - Are we doing that Monty Python sketch? (both laughing) - Everything is a Monty Python sketch. - I don't think Monty Python's funny. And I-\n- You don't? - At all, like, not-\n- That explains so much. - Does it? What does it explain? - What do you think is funny? (Michael laughing) - But you not answering that\nquestion, it's pretty funny. - Yeah. What do you think is funny?\nHaving a mantis shrimp? - No. - Do you think \"Big Lebowski\" is funny? - Oh God, no. Although... - This is getting worse and worse. - To be fair...\n- Yep. - I only tried to watch\n\"Big Lebowski\" after it's been part of the\nculture for many years. - [Lex] Right. - To the point where every single line has been quoted incessantly by the most annoying frat bros ever. - [Lex] Yeah. - So I kind of have\nbeen poisoned to be able to appreciate it. - [Lex] Right. - So maybe if I'd seen\nit when it came out, before it became a thing,\nI would've enjoyed it. I couldn't get through it. Like I couldn't get through 20 minutes. - Is that how you feel\nabout \"Schindler's List\"? - Well... - It's so much easier for\nme to stare at you when you have sunglasses on. - I didn't think you'd be the one making Holocaust jokes today. (Lex laughing)\nAnd yet here we are. - And, cut scene. I actually have like no trouble\nmaking eye contact with you when you're wearing shades. - Yes. 'Cause you're a robot. - Two copies of myself.\n- Yeah. Oh, you're seeing yourself in them? - Mhm.\n- Okay, cool. - Yeah, I'm having a\nconversation with myself. It's not your fault, Lex. - (laughs) They made you like this. You were just a good little\nrobot in St. Petersburg. - I could see Mr. Parrot a little bit too. - But what do you find funny? Come on, this is an interesting subject. - Well, I find Monty Python,\nI find absurdity funny. - Yes. I find absurdity funny. I think that's the thing,\nwhen people come at me, and maybe this is an\nEastern European thing. - Yeah.\n- When they're like, how can you find this like\nvery dark subject funny? It's like, well, the humor, first of all, the humor is that you're making fun\nof something that's dark. So already it's absurd. Like\nit's completely inappropriate. Second, just psychologically, you know, Joan Rivers said that\nWinston Churchill said, I don't know if it's true, that when you make people laugh, you're giving them a little vacation. And I was just thinking\nabout this the other day, how when I die, if, I want\nmy funeral to be a roast. - [Lex] Yeah. - It doesn't help me that everyone's sad. If I brought people happiness\nor joy in life, whatever. I wanna keep doing that in death. Your sadness doesn't help me. I know you can't help it, but tell stories of how it made you laugh. Make fun of me. Make me the punching bag. Even literally take me outta\nthat coffin and beat the... I don't, make me a pinata. I don't care. So I think, and it's I\ndon't understand, well, I do understand, but it's\nsad for me when people are like, you know, this isn't funny. That isn't funny. The way I look at humor is the\nway it's like a chef, right? It's pretty easy to make bacon taste good. But some of these really\nobscure ingredients, to make it palatable, that's takes skill. So if you're dealing with a subject that is very emotional or intense and you can make people\nlaugh, then that takes skill. And that's the relief for them. - Yeah. It's all about timing. - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - [Michael] What's the difference, you wanna hear one of my jokes? - Is it a pirate joke? Because that's the only\nkind I accept today. But no, go ahead. It doesn't have to be a\npirate joke this one time. - Do you know who Lia Thomas is? - [Lex] Yeah. - What's difference between\nLia Thomas and Hitler? - What? - Lia Thomas knows how to finish a race. - Very nice. Very nice. - Did I just get the gold medal? Good job. - Why does it take pirates forever to get through the alphabet? - Why? - Because they spent years at C. - Oh, I thought it was\ngonna be an arr joke. - Nope.\n- That's a good one. I like that.\n- Yeah. - When I was in North Korea- - (laughs) Oh, you know Dennis Rodman? It's a callback. - By the way, the thing\nthat is very heartbreaking about the North Korean\nsituation is that they have a great sense of humor. It would be a lot easier if these were\nlike robots or drones. They have big personalities,\nbig senses of humor. And that made it much\nharder to leave and interact with these people. 'Cause I mean, there's nothing more human\nand universal than laughter and laughter's free. - Are you're saying\nthere's humor even amongst the people that have most of\ntheir freedoms taken away? - Especially, I mean,\nagain, we're from, you know, the Soviet Union. Like, there's anekdoty. Russian humor is a thing because\nthere's nothing you can... If you can't have food or nice things, at least you can have joy\nand make each other laugh. I think about it all the time. And I think about my guide all the time. It's been, what, 2012? So it's been 11 years\nsince I've been there. And she's still there. And everyone I've seen is still there. They just recently electrified the border, so even the few people who are escaping can't do it any more. - Well, that's interesting that they still have a sense of humor. I attribute the Soviet Union for having that because of the like really\ndeep education system. Like you got to read a lot of literature. - Okay.\n- And because of that, you get to kind of\nlearn about the cruelty, the injustices, the\nabsurdity of the world. - [Michael] Right. - As long as the writing is\nnot about the current regime. - Yeah. But I think like, if you look at like African Americans,\nJewish Americans, gay Americans, they are all disproportionate in terms of attributing to comedy. It's not 'cause these groups have some kind of, you\nknow, magic to them. It's that when you are on\nthe outside looking in, A, you're gonna have different\nperspective than the people who are in the middle of the bell curve. But also, when you don't\nhave anything to lose, at the very least you\ncan make each other laugh and find happiness that way. So, you know, that is\nsomething that I think is an important thing to recognize. - So what do you find funny? What makes you giggle like\nin the most joyful of ways? The suffering of others? - I mean, there are YouTube videos of like fat people falling down, and they're really funny. - There's two kinds of\npeople in this world. Those that laugh at those\nvideos and those that don't. - No. And those that are in them. (laughs) My friend Jesse just told me\na great Norm Macdonald joke. And this is a good litmus test joke. 'Cause he says, a certain\ngroup of people lose their minds and a certain group\nof people just stare at you. And he goes, and so\nI'll tell you the joke. This is Norm Macdonald. A guy walks into a bar and\nhe sees someone at the bar who has a big pumpkin for a head. And the guy's like, \"Dude,\nwhat happened to you?\" He goes, \"Ugh, you never believe this. I got one of those genie\nlamps and this genie...\" He's like, \"Well, what happened?\" He goes, \"Well, the first wish, you know, I wished for $100 million.\" He's like, \"Yeah, did you get it?\" He goes, \"Yeah. It goes in my bank account, feels fine.\" He goes, \"All right.\" \"Well, the second wish, I wish to have sex as many\nbeautiful women as I want.\" He goes, \"Did that happen?\" He goes, \"Yeah, it was amazing.\" He goes, \"Then what?\" Well, \"I wished for a giant pumpkin head.\" - (laughs) Yeah. - So there's a certain mindset\nthat will just be staring at the screen. And that is, I mean, there's so many levels why\nthat's funny, at least to me. And I just love that kind of... - Well, Norm Macdonald is like just, I watch his videos all time. He's a guy that definitely\nmakes me giggle. And he's one of the people\nthat makes me giggle for reasons I don't quite understand. - Did you ever see him with\nCarrot Top on Conan O'Brien? - No.\n- Making fun of Carrot Top? - [Lex] No. - This is probably the best\ntalk show clip of all time. He's on with Courtney Thorne-Smith. She was on \"Melrose Place\"\nand Coen O'Brien's the host. And Courtney's talking\nabout how she's gonna be an upcoming movie with Carrot Top. And Coen is like, \"Oh,\nwhat's it gonna be called?\" And she's like, \"Doesn't\nhave a title yet.\" And Norm goes, \"Oh, I know\nwhat should be called, box office poison.\" And they're all laughing\nand she's like, no, no, no. Like the working title is\n\"Chairman of the Board.\" And Conan goes, \"Do something\nwith that, smartass.\" And Norm goes, \"Yeah, board\nis spelled B-O-R-E-D.\" And they all just completely lost it. - There's something about\nhim with words spoken out of his mouth with the way\nhe like turns his head and looks at the camera... - I think he is one of\nthose rare comedians who you really feel like\nhe's talking to you directly. - Yeah.\n- He feels like he's winking at you-\n- Yeah. - In the audience. And he is like, can you\nbelieve I'm doing this? Like it's like he almost,\nhe feels like he's, I don't wanna say imposter, but like he's more a member\nof the audience than he's a member of the people on the stage. - Yeah. It feels like he's on our side. - [Michael] Yes. Yeah. - Whatever the hell our means. - You know Roseanne got him his first job? - Man, Roseanne, you and\nher been hanging out. - I got it. Oh my God Talk about Thanksgiving. When you are talking to Roseanne Barr and making eye contact with this person... It is, I can't even describe it. It's just like, holy crap,\nRoseanne Barr's talking to me. She is, I've said this to her\nface, pathologically funny. Like it does not turn off. And you're sitting there\nand you're like, holy crap. And when you make her laugh, which is that laugh\nthat's in the theme song of her show, you feel like,\nokay, I did a mitzvah, I did something good\nand right in the world that I made Roseanne Barr laugh. And it's also really funny because, and she's gonna hate this, 'cause I tell her she's\nadorable, she doesn't like that. She's little. You think of Roseanne\nBarr as this like force of nature, like a tsunami. She's like five three\nI'd say like maybe 130. Like, and she puts on the sunglasses, you think this little old\nJewish lady, you'd never know, this is one of the most\nepic performers of all time. She lives near here now. So it's just so much fun talking to her. There was an old\nsatirical magazine in the, I think like early 2000s\ncalled Heeb, written by Jews. And she dressed up as Hitler\nfor one of the photo shoots and she was baking little men in the oven. - Oh.\n- I got, I found on eBay. I wanted her to sign it, \"To Michael, it should have been you.\" But she signed it, \"To Michael,\nyou're one smart cookie.\" And now it hangs, \"Love,\nmom, Roseanne Barr.\" And I call her mom. And\nit hangs over my desk. 'Cause I have her like good domestic goddess energy flowing at me. What? - What do you find... What else? So Norm McDonald, Norm- - My favorite comedian is-\n- We agree on something. - My favorite comedian of\nall time is Neil Hamburger. So Neil Hamburger, I don't\nknow if I'm ruining the bit, he's a character performed by this guy named Gregg Turkington. So he comes out in a tuxedo, big eyeglasses holding\nthree glasses of water, (coughs) coughing into the mic. And I remember I saw him\nonce in LA and the girl ahead of me at the table ahead of\nme was with her boyfriend, this basic chick pumpkin spice. She turns to him and she\ngoes, \"What is this?\" And I remember the first\ntime he was on Jimmy Kimmel, and he tells one of his\njokes and it was like, \"Why does ET like Reese's Pieces so much? Well that's what sperm tastes\nlike on his home planet.\" And like no one laughs. And\nhe goes, \"Oh, come on, guys. I have cancer.\" (both laughing) And it just cuts to this\nmarine in the audience with his arms crossed. So if you know what he's doing, it's just absolutely amazing. He opened for Tenacious D\nonce in somewhere I think in Ireland or the UK, one of those. And they're booing him 'cause\nhis jokes are often not funny. He's like, \"Hey, where did\nmy whore ex-wife run off to with that dentist she's shacking up with? I don't know, but when I see her in\ncourt next month, Alaska!\" So they're booing and he goes, \"All right, do you guys want me to\nbring out Tenacious D?\" They're like, \"Yeah!\" \"Do you wanna see your heroes\nand mine, Tenacious D?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Come on, let me hear it. Do you wanna see Tenacious D?\" \"Yeah.\" He goes, \"All right, if I tell this next joke\nand you don't boo me, I'll bring out Tenacious D.\" And it's like, I'm trying to\nthink of one that's not too... - Self censorship is never good. - Okay. He goes, \"Can we agree that George Bush is the worst President\nAmerica's ever had?\" Everyone claps. He goes, \"Which makes it all the stranger that his son, George W.\nBush, was in fact the best.\" - I take it back on the self censorship. - (laughs) So two people\nlaugh and he goes, \"Oh, that's amazing. I guess I'll do an encore.\"\nAnd he did 10 more minutes. It was just like, I love him so much. - It's interesting he\nopened for Tenacious D. Jack Black, that's a comedic\ngenius of a different kind. - Oh yeah. And he was in one of my\nfavorite movies, \"Jesus' Son\", it's this little indie movie. He did a great turn in that. He's really underrated as an\nactor. He's got a lot of range. Like I know they kind\nof kinda get typecast as this kind of one specific type, but he's really, really talented. - But also just like the pure joy. - Yes. He's clearly having fun. - Okay. It is Thanksgiving. So in the tradition, following tradition, what are you thankful for,\nMichael, in this world? - I got... Do you have a list too? - No, not really.\n- Really? - It's up in here.\n- Oh, I mean, but you have several\nthings you're thankful for? - Yes.\n- Okay. - Yes.\n- One of the things I'm- - My list comes from the heart. I don't have to write anything down. - [Michael] Well, I\ndon't have written down. - Okay. - One of the things that\nI'm most thankful for, this is a common answer, but I\ncan back it up, is my family. Because my nephew Lucas is\nnow six years old, and he, when kids have a sense of humor,\nit's like just miraculous. So he stole my sister's phone, his mom, figured out that grandma is\nlisted as mom in the phone. And he calls her up and he's like, \"Michael's in the\nhospital, he's really sick. He didn't wanna tell you.\"\nAnd she's freaking out. He goes, prank! So I took him, Dinesh\nD'Souza just released a movie called \"Police State\", which was actually really\ngood, highly recommend it. I was surprised how much I liked it there. 'Cause he wasn't going\nRepublicans good, Democrats bad. It was just about authoritarianism. And he had a movie premiere at Mar-a-Lago. So I'm like, I gotta\nbring Lucas to Mar-a-Lago. So Lucas is, I'm like, we're\ngoing to the President's house. He's like, \"Oh, the White House?\" And I'm like, no, like a former president. He goes, oh, \"Abe Lincoln?\" And I'm like, okay, kid logic, like he's giving logical answers. This is kinda like AI,\nyou have to program it to, it's using logic correctly. - You should have told him\nis a president that's second to only Abe Lincoln in terms of greatness. - Accomplishments. Yeah. He went up to all the women in their ball gown, you\nknow, evening gowns. And he goes, \"You're so beautiful.\nWere you born as a girl?\" So when you have this six\nyear old asking you this, it was really, really fun. So that is a great joy to have a nephew, and I have another one, Zach, who's coming up in age and\nhe's starting to talk now. That is really, really fun for me. - Getting to watch them, you know, find out about the world\nfor the first time. - And also training them. Like, that he loves being\nfunny and having fun. - You're his audience in a sense. - Yeah... But-\n- 'Cause you giggle and... - We're prank bro's, he\ngives me a high five. My family... And this is one of... You\ntalk about what I find funny. This is things that actually enrage me. When people, and this\nis such a WASP thing, don't just go with the\njoke or they're like, I don't get it, or they don't\nunderstand to just go with it. I was in the car with my sister when she was like 10, 12, whatever. She's much younger than me.\nShe's like 12 years younger. And there's this species\nof squid, by the way, which is asymmetric, one of its eyes is very much bigger than the other, 'cause it swims horizontally,\nand so one's looking up, one's looking down where\nthere's more light. Shout out, if you wanna\nlearn more about squids, go to octonation.com.\n- Octonation. Shout out. - Shout to Warren. - There's a lot of fascinating stuff. Octonation on Instagram. - Yes. I was in the car with my sister. She's like 10 or-\n- Me as a pirate. I'm sorry for the rude interruptions. I appreciate that count, especially. - Yeah, it's a great, yeah. - These jokes and thoughts\nare coming to me at a, like a 10 second delay, so I apologize. - Okay. - Anyway, you were telling about the... - I know where I-\n- Asymmetrical. All right. - So I tell my-\n- Sometimes you need help. - No.\n- The age is getting to you. - (laughs) I was...\n- Your skin is showing it. It's getting dark. - I told my sister, I\ngo, when you were born, one of your eyes was bigger\nthan the other and you had to have surgery to fix it. So she turns, she's like, \"Mom!\" And my mom goes, \"Honey, the important thing is that you're beautiful now, that's all...\" It's like, what's the big deal? It was just a little surgery. And I says like, all right, calls grandma. And grandma goes, she goes, \"Michael said that I was\nborn one of the eyes...\" She goes, why is he telling you this now? It's not a big deal. You were... So the fact that everyone\nwent with this... - Oh...\n- I was so impressed. I was like, this is a quality family in this very specific regard. Does your family have a sense of humor? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah.\n- You know, Soviet culture, there's like a dark sense of humor. - Very much so.\n- There's... - Word play.\n- Word play. (laughs) Yeah. Yeah. And especially the Russian language allows for some like hilarity to it. There's also culture of\nlike poetry and like my dad, my mom too, but they remember a lot of\nlines from books and poems. So there's just, you can do a lot of fascinating references\nthat add to the humor and the richness of the conversation. - I feel like that's a very Russian thing. Like at a party or maybe\nat a bar or something, I don't know where you'd meet people. These are such great ice-\n- Go out. - I meant in Russia, I meant, these would be such\ngood icebreakers, right? You go up to someone goes, hey, did you hear this one anekdot? And you just tell him some little story. - Did you say icebreakers\n'cause it's cold in Russia? (Michael laughing) I'm here all night. - That's true. You never leave the house. - Literally.\n- So... I feel like that's a thing. - [Lex] Yeah. - And that's not a thing in America. - [Lex] You mean like witty banter? - No. Meaning you go up to stranger and like that's your icebreaker. You tell 'em this little joke. And since everyone kinda has the same sensibilities, right away, you guys are chatting. I don't think that's a thing here. - [Lex] Yeah. - Think here it's more small\ntalk, which drives me crazy. - So what else are you thankful for? - Well, what's something\nyou're thankful for? - Well, you went with family. I'm definitely thankful for family. - Okay.\n- Yeah. - How, if I may ask, how\ndo they react to you? Like, you're sitting down with Elon, you're sitting out with Netanyahu, you're sitting down with all\nthese like big, with Kanye, all these big names. Are they expressing that\nthey're proud of you? Or is it more like, why haven't\nyou talked to this person? - (laughs) Yeah. More\nMichael Malice, please. - (laughs) The people's choice. - Yeah. Yeah. They're very proud. They've been very, I mean, but they get argumentative and we just, they're just like a regular human being with whom I'm close and\nwe just argue about stuff. They're not, maybe not enough\nshow the being proud of, but that part is just the\nnature of our relationship. It's also Soviet parents. - Yeah. I don't talk to my dad. That's one of the reasons, 'cause there's never ever any good job. And at a certain point\nit's like, why am I trying to search for approval from someone I'm never gonna get it for? And from who it wouldn't mean\nanything at this point anyway. - Well, that's interesting. I mean, there's a journey\nlike that for a lot of people with their father or with their mother. Like they're always\ntrying to find approval. And that's life for a lot of people. - [Michael] Yeah. - That's a really big part\nof the human condition is that relationship you\nhave with your father, with your mother. I don't know, it's a beautiful thing. So it's, whether it's\nbeen a rough childhood or a beautiful one, all\nof it, that's who you are. Like that, the relationship, especially early on in\nyour life with your father, with your mother, is\nlike extremely formative. - Yeah, my dad taught me a\nlot of things at a young age that I'm very, very grateful for. He's extremely intelligent, very flawed. And that's fine. We\nall are, except for me. And it's the kind of things\nthat when you learn things at a right age, and this is one of the things\nI like about being older, is that when I'm friends with people- - Much older.\n- Much older, when I'm... But much, much older, When I have friends who are younger, it's very easy for me\nto keep them from making the mistakes I did. So at least this is something\nI'm getting out of it is that, okay, I can't fix these mistakes, but it just takes me 30\nseconds and I can pull you back from making the mistake. So he taught me a lot as a kid. He really encouraged me very much to, he has a very good sense\nof humor and also very bad in some ways. Dad jokes, but also really funny jokes. But also this love of learning\nthat I got that from him. And I mean, I have got\nliterally right now 98 books on my shelf to read. It's just a life... That makes me, I remember\nI had a friend and she ran into someone she went to high school with and he stopped you on the train and he is like, yo, you're not in college. You don't need to read books any more. And I was just like\nhorrified to hear this. - Yeah. Yeah. Boy, don't I know it. - I mean, you do laugh, but like, there's a lot of things\nI don't understand. When you got heat for like, I wanna read the Western classics, to me, that might've been like the\ninternet at its absolute worst. - I think there's just a cynical perspective\nyou can take that there. This is such a simple\ncelebration of a thing that there must be something behind it. I think the internet, for good\nand bad, is just skeptical. Like, what's behind this? - My hero, Albert Camus. And if there's one thing I would\nwanna fight, it's cynicism. Because it's such a giving up... It's such, everything sucks. This sucks, that sucks, this\nsucks. Most things suck. Most standard comedians\nsuck. Most movies suck. All podcasts suck. But it doesn't matter. - Especially yours.\n- Especially mine. It's unwatchable.\n- \"YOUR WELCOME\" He can't even spell it correctly. - (laughs) But the stuff\nthat's good is what matters. Who caress if 90% of movies are terrible, like they're the ones that\nchange your life, the books, the people, the comedians,\nthe shows, the music... - And even the terrible things have good moments, beautiful moments. - [Michael] Some, not all. - Your podcast being\nan example of not all. I've literally just, I keep listening for something good, something good. - In all fairness, none of my\nguests have anything to offer. That's not on me. I try. - Yeah. Well, I wish you'd talk a\nlittle less in your podcast. It's a little excessive. I only listen for the\nunderwear commercials. - Sheathunderwear.com,\nprobably called Malice. - I think you did this, I haven't seen you do it in a while, but this kind of commentary\non a debate or I think it was with Rand, like an Ayn\nRand debate or something. - Oh yeah. Malice at the Movies. I watched the video and I broke it down. - [Lex] That was really great.\nI wish you did that more. - I haven't done live\nstreaming in a long time. It was something I was doing a lot in New York, especially during COVID. I feel that, I don't know, I got so many projects\non the plate, I'm, oh, this is something else I'm thankful for. This is something I'm very, very thankful for and I'm\ngonna announce it here. - [Lex] Coming out of the closet. Finally. Go ahead. Who's the lucky guy? (both laughing) - You're the one in drag. - Guns out. Guns out.\n- He makes me- - The sleeves off.\n- He makes me call him Sex Friedman. - (laughs) You like it. - So... I didn't say it. - All right.\n- Didn't even imply that. When I, in, as you\nprobably know, as you know, but as many people\nwatching this also know, Harvey Pekar who had\nthat comic book series, \"American Splendor\" was the subject of movie \"American Splendor\". He wrote a graphic novel about me in 2006 called \"Ego and Hubris\", which\ngoes for like $150 on eBay. It's not worth it, just download it. And I met Harvey because\nI wrote this screenplay about this band from the\n'80s called Rubber Rodeo. It's a real band. And the keyboardist, Gary\nLeib, who passed away, rest in peace, Gary, introduced me to Harvey\n'cause he did the animation for the movie. And this script's been in\nmy desk for over 20 years. And I realized, thanks\nto my buddy Eric July, who has some huge success with his comics, I could just produce\nthis as a graphic novel. So I've got an artist,\nwe're getting it together, so I'm gonna make it happen finally. And it's some of the best\nwriting I've ever done. I'm really proud of the story. It's kind of ironic reading it now, because when you're a writer, obviously, different books, you put different aspects of yourself into them. Right? And this story's very, very dark because basically they did all the right things and they went nowhere. Right? And what I realized was reading it now that all these fears I\nhad over 20 years ago about what if I'm not gonna make it? What if, you know, I'm doing all the hard work\nand it's still not enough? Now it's been disproven 'cause\nI can at least pay my rent. - You feel you've, like, you've made it, 'cause you said you could pay your rent? - I feel that to make it is if you don't have to have a boss, and you know how I really\nfelt like I made it? This is gonna sound like\na joke and it's not. This is being an immigrant. I own, as you know, Margaret\nThatcher's bookcases. - Yes.\n- So to me, as an immigrant, to have her bookcases in\nmy house, I've made it. - You are right. It's not a joke. - It's not, there's nothing\nfunny about it at all. - Not laughing.\n(Michael laughs) It's time to get serious. - Oh, nice. Oh, now I'm\nmore nervous and aroused. So what else are you thankful for? So we're both thankful for family. - I mean, I'm, the fact that I can... - Still get it up?\n- What's that? - Nothing, go ahead. - I think as an author, to be able to write what\nyou want and have of enough an audience that it covers your living... That's as good as it\ngets as an author almost. You don't need to be\nStephen King or some legend. It's like, you know, there's lots of standups who\naren't like world famous, but they have perfectly good\nliving, they do their gig, they do what they love. I feel very, very blessed. But you must be thankful for your career. - Yeah, yeah. Career-wise... But like, I think the best part about it's just meeting, making friends. - Okay.\n- With people I admire. - Okay, cool. - Quite honestly, just friends. I, you know, the people\nthat have gotten to know me, I hide from the world sometimes, I hit some low points,\nespecially with this new, all the new experiences\nand just the people that have been there for me\nand haven't given up on me. - You know, there's days, and I'm sure you've had this also, where like, I literally don't speak\nto someone the whole day. And in certain times of\nmy life, it's really, I remember very vividly, I was in DC in '97, I was an intern, and that summer, DC closes\ndown on the weekends. And I remember those\nweekends when like I got off the phone with like the\nthird person, I knew there was no possibility anyone was gonna call. And what that felt like. And\nit was dark and it was bad. So I remember those feelings\nof loneliness like a lot. - I still feel alone like that sometimes. You don't feel alone? - Not any more. - What's the reason, you think? - There's like, I have a lot of people who I care about\nand who care about me. I mean the thing about\nmoving to Austin is I forgot how lonely New York got, because it was like one after\nanother I lost everybody and then you start losing\nthe places you go to. And then it was just like,\nholy crap. I'm very isolated. And here in Austin there's\nnot as much to do, obviously, as in New York, but there's\na lot of people here. More people are coming all the time. So if I ever want to like hang out with someone, you know,\nI've got a long list. And these are people who I've\nknown for a very long time. People who know me quite\nwell. So I could be myself. My awful, awful, awful,\nawful, awful, self. And that is something\nI don't take lightly. - Now you moved to\nTexas, it's gonna secede. - Yeah.\n- It's just a very... - Do you know what happened with that? - [Lex] No. - I forget the guy's name. And it's probably for the best. Monday, on Monday, a guy in the Texas legislature\nintroduces a bill to have it on the referendum, to have\na referendum for Texas to declare its independence. Tuesday I'm on Rogan.\nMe and him discuss it. I give it national attention. It was also really funny\nbecause a lot of people are like, \"These people have been in Texas five minutes, blah, blah.\" I go to the Texas legislature,\nmeet with the guy, have a nice conversation. A month or two later, unanimous, I think, he gets voted, kicked out\nof Congress because he got an intern drunk and was\ninappropriate with her. At least it was a girl in this case. But yeah, so it's like, that was my little Texas\nindependence moment. - Oh. It didn't go anywhere? - It did not go anywhere.\n- Wow. - But it's still part of the platform of the Texas Republican Party. - Yeah. It's fascinating that\nhistory is probably laden with stories like this of\nfailed revolutionaries. We celebrate the heroes, but\nthen there's the losers like... - Myself. - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - And we're gonna mark\nthat one as a failure and edit it out. And moving on. So, thankful... Yeah. Friendships. Right. But by the way, I wanna say just to you, I'm thankful in this\nlonely moments for people who write books. I've been listening to audiobooks\na lot and reading a lot. I really like audiobooks actually. And just like, I don't know, I can just name random\nperson, Serhii Plokhy, he's a historian, I'm reading on the... - Wait, I read him. What do you, what do-\n- I just, he written a book most recently about the Russia-Ukraine war. - He wrote another one that I read. Didn't he write about-\n- Empires, I think? - The fall of the Soviet\nUnion or something like that. - Yeah, yeah.\n- Yeah. It was very, very good.\n- He's great. It's true. - I used him as a resource\nfor \"The White Pill\". - He's objective, while still having\nemotion and feeling to it. Like he has a bias... - [Michael] That's fine. - But without, a lot of\ntimes when you write a story that involves Putin, people\nare really ideological. - Yeah.\n- They don't really like, they don't write with a\ncalmness and the clarity and the rigor of history. There's emotion in it. Like there's almost a virtue signaling. - Yeah.\n- And he doesn't have that, even though he is Ukrainian\nand has very strong opinions on the matter. Anyway, there's people\nlike that and he's done an incredible job\nresearching a recent event. Like he says, I was looking at everything that's been written\nabout the war in Ukraine and realizing, you know,\nthe old Churchill line, that historians are\nthe worst ones to write about current events\nexcept everybody else. And so he is like, I might as well just write about this war. And he does an exceptional\njob summarizing day by day the details of this war. Anyway. So I'm just grateful\nfor a guy like that. - So for me there's,\nI'll name some historians I love, Arthur Herman, Victor Sebestyen is probably my favorite, David Pietrusza, P-I-E-T-R-U-S-Z-A. When you are a historian, and I tried to do this to some degree in \"The White Pill\", as far as I could. But yeah, when you take data\nand you make it read like a novel, so you're learning about who we are as\npeople, what had happened, but also it's entertaining and readable... That to me is like the acme of writing. And I have so much admiration... - What does acme mean?\n- Top. - Okay. - Zenith.\n- Zenith, okay. This is what writers do? They just come up with these\nincredibly sophisticated words? I'm impressed. - Well, acme's-\n- Because you could've just said the best of writing. - Acme is also the\ncompany in like Bugs Bunny and Wiley Coyote is always\nAcme, you know, Acme? - Yeah.\n- Yeah. Like Acme bombs. When they are that good, it's\njust it leaves me in awe. Ron Chernow is another one.\n- Who? - He wrote the Hamilton biography. - Oh, nice. Oh, I have a lot of favorite historians about the whole time period of World War II, William Shirer, people that lived during it, especially, I really like those accounts. Obviously Solzhenitsyn\nis, he's not a historian, but his accounts are Fascinating. You actually, how much do\nyou talk about Solzhenitsyn? - Never.\n- Not much. Right? Why not? - I feel like I wanted to... There's something I could add to him. - [Lex] Oh, he didn't, he's the Michael Malice\nof the previous century? - No, he's talented,\ncharismatic, and skilled. So he is not the Michael Malice. Yeah, I did not, I feel like I didn't... I didn't read \"Gulag Archipelago\"\nfor \"The White Pill\". I feel-\n- You didn't? - I didn't. No. I feel I got a lot of\nit from Anne Applebaum, who's a very controversial figure. Her history books on the Soviet\nUnion, I think, are superb. But she's also accused of\nbeing very much like a neocon and being a war monger\nin contemporary times. - [Lex] Oh, I see. - And I think comparisons\nbetween Putin and Stalin, although there is a Venn diagram, I think are a bit much, because I think it's very\nhard to claim that, you know, if Putin conquered Ukraine,\nthat there'd be a genocide. I think that's a very\nhard argument to make. - In these tense times, even the comparisons of\nwhat's going on in Israel, on either side, comparisons\nto the Holocaust are also troubling in this way. - Yes. And I also don't like how that term... You know, I got in trouble, there was some literal demon who works at The Atlantic and... - As opposed to a regular demon? - As opposed to figurative demon. - I didn't know they employ demons. - They exclusively employ\ndemons at The Atlantic. And he was giving me crap\nthis a couple years ago on Twitter because I didn't\nthink it's appropriate to refer to George Soros\nas a Holocaust survivor. And I'm like, listen, if you wanna put him in the same context as Anne Frank, knock yourself out. But I think that's so\ncompletely disingenuous and frankly repulsive to me, morally, to equivocate between figures like that. And also to claim that\nanyone who is a billionaire who is, including Elon,\nincluding Sheldon Adelson, there's no shortage of these people, if you wanna use your extreme wealth, use it to influence politics, you have to be up for criticism, and to protect people, Bill Gates, protecting these people from criticism just on the base of their\nidentity is deranged to me. - But also the Holocaust\nas a historical event, and the atrocities within it\nare just singular in history. - Right.\n- And so comparing them... - What's the utility? Right? You're just basically\ntrying to take this brand, I'm using that term, you know, in a very specific way and latch, like when they say climate denial, no one's denying climate exists. So you're just trying to\ngo off of Holocaust denial. I think it's shameless\nand I think it's gross. - And it cheapens everything.\n- Yeah. - 'Cause there's deep important\nlessons about the Holocaust. - Yes. - To me the lessons are about\nhow extreme it can get... - And how fast.\n- Yeah. And how fast. - That's the one. So, you know, people ask, oh,\nare humans basically good? Are they basically evil? I always say they're basically animals. And I think people are, most people are almost\nfundamentally deranged. And that there's basically this veneer of civilization and decency. And when shit hits the fan, and we see this over and over, they do things that would've been\ncompletely unthinkable even to themselves five years ago. - Most people are fundamentally deranged with a veneer of civility... - [Michael] There's a show called... - I Think I disagree with that. - [Michael] Well, what's the show called? I'm having Alzheimer's 'cause of the advanced age.\n- The age... The skincare...\n- There's a show called, \"I Think You Should Leave\". It's a sketch show.\n- I think you should leave. Okay. Sorry. - It's a sketch comedy show. And he captures these great...\nHow's your hair, princess? He captures these great\nmoments of just the, like, just the very thin veneer\nof normalcy and just the craziness that's so\nfrequently lurking underneath. Another great example of this, when this is dealing with\npeople who are literally crazy. Have you ever seen the show \"Hoarders\"? So every episode of\n\"Hoarders\", there's two, usually two people in every episode, but every episode has the same plot line. Veneer of normalcy, veneer of\nnormalcy, veneer of normalcy, slight expression of concern,\nfull blown derangement. And it always follows that exact pattern. - Yeah. I don't know. I think the deep\nocean of the human mind is... Is good. Like there's a\nlonging to be good to others. - I have seen literally\nno evidence of this. And I know everything's a deep ocean with you people, but like... - What do you mean you people? - Pirates? - Oh.\n- I don't see it. - What's that Mr. Parrot?\nHe's an antisemite. No, that's not nice to\nsay in front of such a large audience. You're embarrassing me, Mr. Parrot. - Lex, you have-\n- What's that, Mr. Parrot? - You have-\n- He's a run of the mill troll and barely an intellectual? That's not nice to say. That's not true. We talked about this. You have\nto see the good in people. - You have seen personally...\n- Yep. - How quickly and easily\nit is for human beings to form outgroups. - Yeah.\n- And to just read others, just as I just did a minute ago with The Atlantic, completely\nout of the human race. And that happens\nconstantly and very easily. Humans are tribal beings. So that does not, I don't see how that's compatible with this essential desire to do good. - No, I think it's like\nin 1984, the two minutes of hate, there is a part\nof humans that wants to be tribal, and wants to\ndirect, get angry and hateful. And then that hate is easy to direct. By especially people as\nyou, as an anarchist talk about there are people in power, they- - Yes.\n- Direct that anger. But I think if you just look\nat recent human history, the desire for good, the communal desire for good\noutweighs that, I think. Like most of life on Earth right now, people are being good to each other, in a most fundamental sense, relative to how nature usually works. - Okay. I think you're both wrong\nabout people and about nature. So nature is not inherently\nviolent in the sense, like for example, if\nanyone has an aquarium or if you look at wildlife, yeah, you're gonna have predator or prey. But these animals are gonna be coexisting and they're gonna be ignoring\neach other for the most part. Right? And as for humans, you know,\nbeing essentially good, I think humans are essentially,\nto each other, you said, I think they're essentially\ncivil and amiable, but that's not really being good. - Good, I think, is a thing that gets illustrated when you're challenged, when there's- - Yes.\n- Difficult situations. - Exactly. Yes. - I mean, civility is\na good starting point. And then when there's a\nbig challenge that comes, people step up, on average. - I completely agree with\nyou that human beings are capable of such profound\ngoodness that it kind of makes you extremely emotional. And I certainly think that that's true. But I think that that's more\nunusual than it is the norm. - I see beauty everywhere. - So do I. But that doesn't mean\nit's in every person. - Not in every person, but in most people. I think, I mean, I wish there was a really\ngood way to measure this. My general sense of the world is just, there's so much incredible of\nboth in terms of economics, in terms of art, in terms of just creation\nas a whole that's happened over the past century that\nit feels like the good is outpowering the bad. - You just did the\nperfect segue to the box. - What's in the box. - So...\n- Is it your fragile ego? - That's my, you stole my joke! You stole my joke! That was the joke I made\nat you before we recorded. You stole my joke! - No, no, I didn't. I write all your material, you hack. - (laughs) So, as you know, I have a lot of beautiful\nstuff in my house. 'Cause I think it's something very\nimportant, everyone listening. If you accomplish something that is great, some achievement, what I like to do is buy myself something\nto remember that moment. 'Cause sometimes when it's hard, you forget you've done\ngreat things in your life, you've had accomplishments. It doesn't have to be\nsome amazing factory. It could just be like\nmy first job where I got a raise or, you know what, I... Anything. So there's this amazing sculptor\nnamed Jake Michael Singer, a singer who's a sculptor. And I saw a piece of his-\n- How's his singing voice? This is, joke's not gonna-\n- Hold on. I could go somewhere with this. - Okay.\n- How's his singing voice? - Do you want me to\nwrite your joke for you? - Yeah. What's the punchline? Hard. (both laughing)\nThere it is, that's... - That's what she said. - So I followed him on\nInstagram, he followed me back. And he is like, if I made, he says, what's the point of being\nan artist if this work I create isn't in the spaces\nof people I like and admire? He's a big fan of yours.\nYou've given him... And our episodes together give him joy. So he said, if I make Lex a sculpture, will he put on the shelf behind him? And what that reminded me\nof is when I was a kid, you read Batman comics\nand there's the Batcave. And the Batcave has all\nthis cool stuff in it. I didn't realize until much later that all of those things in the\nBatcave had an origin story. - [Lex] Hmm. - So the giant penny, the dinosaur, there was actually a story\nwhere that came from. So if you're a fan of a\nshow, you can spot, oh, this is when this appeared,\nthis is when that appeared, this when that appeared. So he made you this sculpture, he lives in Turkey and it's\ncalled \"Chance Murmur\". And it is, I haven't even seen it yet. It is absolutely beautiful. - All right, this... So you wanna do a little unboxing? - Yes.\n- Okay. Axe or? - Body spray.\n- (laughs) All right. - Let's do it.\n- Let's unbox. - I'm so excited. Hey, Lex has got a box. (both laughing) - You know that Steven Segal\nmovie where there's like a stripper that comes outta the box? - Is there...\n- \"Under Siege\"? - Okay.\n- He's on a boat. You're not an action film guy. - No. - One. What does the pirate say when he turns 80? - What?\n- I am 80. - Aye matey. Oh. (both laughing) - [Lex] Oh. See that's how\nI know you don't like humor. - I just don't like pirates. - [Lex] Well, your mom does. Do you play any musical instruments? - No. Neither do you. I've seen\nyour guitar videos. (laughs) - Okay. Here's a big piece of wood for you. That's what it feels\nlike, just so you know. - Oh wow. - You need help?\n- Yeah. - Oh my God. - This traveled across the world. - So here's why his work\nspeaks so much to me. So first of all, he's combining so many\ndifferent references. It's Nike, the Goddess of Victory. Right? It's that it looks like an angel as well. The Italian futurist, which is my favorite art movement from the early 20th century, they tried to capture\nmotion in 2D or 3D form. - Well, Jake, thank you,\nthank you, thank you, thank you for creating beautiful things. And I thank you for caring\nabout somebody like me and somebody like Michael,\nwho really feels the love. - That's the other thing.\n- Thank you. - When you have something\nthat matters to you in your house and you're having a bad day, you can look at it and\nremember, you know what I mean? That spirit of joy. And I\nactually have a list here. - Okay.\n- I got a little rant ready? Do you wanna hear my rant?\n- Yeah, let's go. You're... - One of the things that drives me crazy is when people, especially conservatives, think that all contemporary\nart is ugly or abstract or like literally garbage. And there's a lot of that. But so much of the stuff\nout there in galleries is not only not crazy expensive, but they're trying to sell\nthings for people in their house. And these are young artists, you know, they're trying to add beauty. I have a list, so if you don't believe me and you think all\ncontemporary art is garbage or terrible, go to the\nwebsite or any of these places that I'm gonna rattle\noff, look through them, and you're telling me that it's not about creating beauty and joy\nand things in people's lives. So I don't have any relationship\nwith any of these people. These are just some galleries\nI follow on Instagram. Outre Gallery, Antler Gallery,\nGiant Robot 2, Beinart, I dunno how to pronounce it, I'm sorry, B-E-I-N-A-R-T,\nSpoke Art Gallery, Var Gallery, Milwaukee, I was there. The pieces were not expensive at all. - What kind of art are we\ntalking about? Everything? - Mostly paintings. Mostly paintings. Some\nsculptures too, like this. Corey Helford is my favorite one in LA. Night Gallery, Vertical\nGallery, Avant Gallery, Hive Gallery, Haven Gallery,\nand Curio Art Gallery. I'm telling you, it's not exorbitant. This is not the kind of\nthing where you have to go to museum and be like, this\ndoesn't make sense to me. You look at it right\naway, you're like, okay, I know what this is. And it's beautiful. It's awesome. And you're supporting someone who's young and creative trying to do\nsomething and make the world a better place. So I'm a big fan of the\ncontemporary art scene. A lot of it is not great, but even the stuff that's not great is very rarely disgusting or gross. It's just like, okay,\nI've seen this before, or something like that. - [Lex] Okay. - It's like the difference between, there's like a standup\nwhere like I'll pay money for the ticket and someone's\nlike, who's an opener? It's like I wouldn't\npay to see him perform, but he sure still made me laugh. That person is still more,\nby far more good than bad. So a lot of this art\nisn't stuff I would own, but it's like, okay, I get it. I like it. - Well, as the analogy goes, I really like going to open mics actually, because like, it sounds absurd to say, but funny isn't the only\nthing that's beautiful about standup comedy, it's the act, the... - [Michael] Yeah- - No, it's going for it,\nit's trying to be funny, it's taking the leap, trying to joke and some of the best stuff is actually funny, but the audience is like three people, two of whom are drunk and bored and\nyou're still going for it. And that's like, that's the\nhuman spirit right there. - Roseanne was telling me how\nGilbert Gottfried would go on. It was like three in the\nmorning and it was like five, her and like three other\ncomics in the audience. And like, they all were just dying. Like he was just killing them.\nWho's your favorite comedian? - Dave Smith. - Who? - And cut scene. Favorite comedian, first Norm McDonald, if you like put a gun to my head and I had to answer really\nquickly, that would be him. - [Michael] Okay. - I would also say Louis C.K.. - Oh wow. Yeah. Oh my God. Yes. - But that's almost like a\nvanilla answer at this moment in history because it's like... - Louis C.K.'s pretty radioactive. - He is. Well, he does it... The tough topics- - Sure.\n- The best. Mitch Hedberg. The wit of\na good one-liner is great. I guess that's what Norm\nMcDonald's genius is at. - [Michael] Yes. - What about you? - There's a, I mean, we're so fortunate to be here in Austin because like Comedy Mothership, you go there and like\npeople are just killing it. David Lucas is amazing. - Thai Rivera, Thai Rivera probably did the best set I've seen since I've been here in Austin. And I watched him, and\nI'm like, this guy's even bitchier than I am. So I reached out to him.\nSo he's just terrific. David Lucas is another\none. A buddy of mine. - You just said a choice, I think. - [Michael] I'm thinking,\nDave Landau. Excuse me. - Yeah.\n- Dave Landau. Joe Mackey.\n- Old age catching up. - It's true though. - It's true.\n- It's true. - It's true.\n- Dave Lucas. - You ever been to the Comedy Mothership? It's a great spot. - Where is that? Is that in Austin? - Austin? Is that where Willie Nelson's\nfrom? I haven't really. Go ahead, I'm sorry. - Oh, I heard a joke\nabout that the other week. What's the-\n- Tell a joke again. - What's the only thing\nworse than giving head to Willie Nelson? - What? - If he says, I'm not Willie Nelson. (both laughing) - What's that Mr. Parrot?\nI know he is not funny. He thinks he's better on Twitter, but that's not nice to say\nright in front of his face. Just think about how he feels. - The statue Chance Murmur is judging you. - Chance?\n- It's called Chance Murmur. - Chance Murmur. - God, that's so beautiful. - That's gorgeous. - This is another reason I hate cynicism and I talk about this a lot. Even just on Etsy, there's so many small, not huge companies, like\nindividual artisans, who are creating great stuff\nand just making it happen. And it's really sad for me\nwhere people can't see that. Or if they're like, well how could I be\nexcited about a sculpture when blah-blah-blah the Middle East? And it's just like, you can always look for an\nexcuse not to look for joy, or you could look for an\nexcuse to look for joy. - Yeah. That's incredible. I feel the same way about OnlyFans. I can't even get that outta\nmy mouth before laughing at my own failed joke. - That's what she said.\n- Edit. Oh? All right. That might be one of the\nfirst that's what she said from a Michael Malice. - Yeah.\n- I'm gonna count that. - I don't know what\nI'm gonna do with mine, 'cause I got my own, mine's\nthree feet tall, just like me. - Your box was much bigger.\n- Yeah. - And it was giving me\nan inferiority complex. I think I'm gonna invade Russia. (Michael laughing) That's a Napoleon reference\nfor those in the audience. - I don't know if I'm gonna,\nI think I'm gonna put it in my bedroom so that\nit's the first thing I see when I wake up. - Put in the bedroom?\n- Yeah. - Do we get through\neverything we're thankful for? - No. I've got lots of\nthings I'm thankful for. - What else? Friends, family... We said books. - I'm thankful for career. I am thankful for... I am thankful for, and I know people are\ngonna lose their minds and I can hear them flipping out already, I am thankful for social media. - Yeah.\n- For several reasons. First, it is a way for\npeople to make connections that they couldn't have\nmade in years past. That if you got some weird hobby, you can find that other\nperson's weird hobby and you make that connection. It's a great way to stay\nin touch permanently for people otherwise\nyou'd lose touch with, you know, whatever venue. And it's also a great\nway to expose corporate depravity, when you\nhave these organizations that are dishonest, I think\nthe Community Notes thing on Twitter is the greatest thing ever. - Ah, that's incredible. I wish they would pay attention to the Michael Malice account more often. - You shouldn't be encouraging\nanyone to pay attention to my Twitter account. - Yeah.\n- It's a dumpster fire. And I don't mean Bridget, I mean like a literal- - Bridget, by the way, is amazing. But your Twitter account-\n- She lives here? - Yes. Not here. I wish she did. - She's in Georgetown. - No, I mean in this,\nwhere we're sitting... - Oh.\n- It's a joke, Michael. - Is it?\n- Yeah. - But I'm just really glad about, it's another way for people who before would've felt very alone. I know it makes some people do feel alone, but for other people, it\nmakes them feel connected. - There's been a lot of talk\nabout antisemitism recently. - [Michael] Yeah. - What's your sense\nabout this? Is there... Is antisemitism like\nany other brand of hate? There's a lot of hate out there. - No, I don't think it's\nlike any other brand of hate, because I don't\nthink racists or transphobes or homophobes or misogynists\nor xenophobes argue openly or even not so openly for the killing of black Americans,\ntransgender people, gay people, women or immigrants. And it's not only something\nthat's talked about, it's something that has actually happened. And not just the Holocaust,\nbut just centuries of pogroms. Right? There's this great book\nthat I read many years ago called \"The Satanization of the Jews\", Camille Paglia recommended\nit and I read it. And they live in this certain\nspecific kind of antisemitism. And I'm, again, I'm not talking about people who are\nagainst Israel or something. I'm talking specifically about Jew hatred. They have this moral calculus that Jews are the only people who are\ncapable of good or evil, and Jews are exclusively capable of evil. And for example, if you\nlook at the George W. Bush White House, you had W, you had Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Colin\nPowell, Donald Rumsfeld, a lot of these neocon advisors. So if there's 10 people in a room and there's one Jewish\nperson, it's his fault, and the rest are Jew controlled. So again, they only\nexist as a puppet of Jews in this kind of worldview. And it's like that, to\nme, if there were no Jews on Earth, it is crazy\nto say that John Bolton and Liz Cheney and Lindsey\nGraham wouldn't be pushing for more war. That makes no sense to me. It's like, you blame the\nJews when bad things happen. But when a Jewish person\ndoes something good, it doesn't really matter. Or just wait. He's gonna do something bad. Well, yeah, that's true. Human beings do good things and then they do bad things sometimes. But it only counts when\nthat Jewish person does the bad thing. - I wonder what's a way\nto fight antisemitism and fight hate in general? - I think the only, or the best way, 'cause I thought a lot about this, about how did gay Americans go from being universally hated\nand despised to the point that many people in the\n'80s went to their graves, those who had AIDS without even telling their parents, 'cause they were so scared to now Times Square is just\ncovered in pride flags. And I think, and this also\nworks for Islamophobia and some of these other\nbigotry is what I call the ambassador program. Because as soon as you know\nsomeone who is a member of a certain group, it is a lot harder to\nbe bigoted against them. Because instead of this\nbeing this outgroup that's somewhere out there,\nit's like, wait a minute, I work with this guy, yeah, he's kind of a jerk and\nmaybe he sees things a little differently than me, but this guy is not a\nhorrible human being. So I think the only way to\nfight any form of bigotry is to be a good example of the counter to these whatever archetype or\nstereotype is in the culture. - Karl Marx wrote that\nreligion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the\nsoul of a soulless condition. It is the opium of the people.\nAs the famous phrase goes. Do you think he has a point? - No, I hate that quote. I absolutely hate it. I despise this sort of Reddit\ninternet atheist activism for the simple reason\nthat I know many people, who in finding faith, have become objectively\nbetter human beings. They start living consciously. They take morality seriously. They try, we all fail,\nto be moral good people. So this sneering that these midwits, these marginally intelligent people have towards religious people... Now lots of religious people use religion to rationalize their bad\nbehavior or, you know, sinful or big ego so and so forth. That exists. That's true. But to say that it never helps anyone and it's universally the... See, Marx was talking\nabout a period, I mean, I'll defend his quote, when\nhis argument was, you know, the masses are being\nstarved and oppressed, but they're promised, don't worry, you'll have riches in Heaven. So you should kind of like, let yourself be pushed around now. And this is kind of this\nBS bargain that the people are being given. So that was, I think,\nthe point he was making. It certainly doesn't apply nowadays. I'm close to the family in the Midwest. They're good Christian people. I remember very specifically\nthis guy, shout out to him, Sean Sherrod, I\nwent to college with him, David Lucas, and... - Have you checked out\nthe Comedy Mothership, great, great club.\n- Where is it? Is it in Austin?\n- Willie Nelson. - And I, you know, I was 17, 18 freshman year and I was\nreading all this criticism of the Bible and I was like,\nlook, this is in there, look at this in there. And he put his hand on my shoulder and he says, \"Michael, there's nothing you're\ngonna tell me that's going to make me lose my faith.\" And that was a very self-aware\nand profound thing to say... As I've gotten older, I know\nlots of religious people. There's no part of me\nthat thinks they're wrong or they should be mocked. It's like, it also reminds\nme of when people sneer at addicts in recovery, they're like, \"Alcoholism isn't a\ndisease. It's a choice.\" It's like, wait a minute. You don't know what it's like to have your entire life\nruined by drugs or alcohol. And if you have to tell\nyourself, you know, I have this disease and blah blah blah, and that keeps you from drinking and now you're a moral, upstanding\nperson who's reliable and then takes responsibility\nfor their actions, I don't see the harm at all. So I think this kind of\nactivist atheism is cheap. I don't agree with it whatsoever. And I do not like that quote at all. - But otherwise, big fan of Marx. - I mean, I think there's a fan of mine. I forget who it was. Apologies. He had this great quote. He goes, and this is me talking. He goes, the games people\nplay to feel smarter than others is depressing and annoying. And I think this kind of\nfedora internet atheism is a good example. 'Cause here's the other thing. If you've proven that\nsomeone else is stupid, that doesn't mean you're smart. You could both be stupid. So congrats. You prove someone else\nis stupid. Who cares. - Yeah. And sneering in all forms. - [Michael] Yes. - In general is just not great. - That's one of the\nthings I block out people on social media instantly. You're not gonna sneer at me in my space. You could sneer me all\nyou want in your space, but I'm not putting up with your crap. I don't know you. - MySpace, great social network. - Is that on Sixth Street? - AOL.com. (Michael imitates beeping) That's how Lex comes. (both laughing) - Like a Pavlov's dog, that was the sound before you get to see, spend 10 minutes waiting\nfor an image of a lady load, one line at a time. (imitates monitor) I recently talked to John Mearsheimer, I dunno if you know him at all. So he has this idea\nabout offensive realism. It's a way to analyze the\nworld, international relations. And the basic idea, and I'll run it by you\nand see what you think is that states, nations want to survive and they try to do so by maximizing\npower, military power. And he talks about anarchy\nquite a bit in that one of these underlying assumptions\nof this way of viewing the world is that states are\nanarchic towards each other. - Yes, that's true. - And they operate under\na lot of uncertainty. States cannot be sure that other states will not use military capabilities against them. - Right. - They want to survive and they want to use military power to\ncontrol the uncertainty to protect themselves. - So I disagree in that regard. And I see on your bookshelf, I think the world is a lot\ncloser to \"Brave New World\" than it is to \"1984\". And I think it is, if you look at, let's suppose China's\ninfluence in America, right? The influence is far\nmore through soft power than military power. China doesn't threaten\nAmerica through, you know, we're gonna kill you. It's more like the infiltration of universities, TikTok,\nthings of that nature. Maybe this would've worked\nbefore the pop culture era. But I think one of the\nreasons we have this kind of American hegemony isn't just a function of American military. I think it's much more a function of American popular culture. When you're exporting ideas and culture, it makes other people in\nother countries feel closer to you, and also regard you as a friend, and also to adopt your values. It's a great way to spread propaganda. - It seems to correlate though, right? It's interesting. It's an interesting idea\nwhat has more power, the viral spread of ideas or\nthe power of the military? It seems that the United\nStates is at the top of the world on both. - [Michael] That's true. - And so it's hard to disentangle the two. - Let's look at Europe. American culture is very\npopular in Europe in many ways. Right? Like the best music comes out\nof Sweden, Swedish indie pop. They're singing in English. You know, even though so on and so forth. None of this is a function, maybe it's a function of post\nWorld War II to some extent. But I don't think it's a\nfunction of American bases there. I think it's a function of\nwe're exporting our music, our TV shows, and our movies. - Yeah. It's interesting. If the battleground will\nbe \"Brave New World\", the battle of ideas. - I think it's clearly,\nit's so much cheaper. And again, this is one of the\ndark sides of social media, to use influence than\nit is to use threats. I don't think, I think COVID\nis a good example of this. Like, so much of the pressure, yes, there was authoritarianism,\nbut it was the fact that everyone bought into\nit, rightly or wrongly, but the vast majority of the\npopulation was behind all of these things. And that was through\npersuasion, not 'cause... And 'cause people are\nbegging for it to come back in many cases. - So who's funding you?\nWhich intelligence agency? - Mossad.\n- Mossad, Mossad. This is how you do great interviewing. See, he didn't even\nexpect that. (chuckling) Okay. - What's that, Mr. Parrot? - Mr. Parrot. You knew it, but you didn't\nhave any documentation, did you? - I think Mr. Parrot is\nthreatened by the better wings, not a Chance Murmur. - He gets like that when he is turned on. - Oh. Okay.\n- He's not threatened. You can't wait until he's, all three of us are alone together. It's gonna be one hell of a party. - Beaks and feathers everywhere. - And metal. Yeah. This thing's beautiful. - [Michael] It's ridiculous. - You have actually a\nlot of really cool stuff at your place. - [Michael] It's so fun. - What's a cool thing\nthat stands out to you? Maybe a recent edition. - So I went to the Dallas\nMuseum of Art last year for my birthday. And there was a painting\nI liked and I Googled it and I saw the auction\nfor that exact painting. And it was like, I think three grand, which is not cheap, but not something... You think in a museum, I can never afford\nsomething like this, right? So when I was in, I went to\nHouston with some friends, the Sideserf, Natalie,\nwho made the cake of you. - Oh yeah. Cake terrified my mom. - Did it?\n- Yeah. - [Michael] Oh... - [Lex] No, it's not the\ncake that terrified my mom. It's you, Michael Malice, cutting it off, cutting the face off\nand laughing maniacally. - Well, Natalie's pregnant. She's gonna have a daughter named Daisy. So congrats to Natalie. - [Lex] Congrats- - But I was in the museum with\nthem and they was a statue of Thoth who's the Egyptian\ngod whose head is an ibis. It's a bird with a long beak. And Thoth is the god of\nthe Moon, god of knowledge, and supposedly he invented writing. So I thought, you know what? I've always loved ancient\nEgypt. I know a lot about it. And especially the mythology. It'd be really cool as an aspiring author to have an ancient Egyptian\nThoth statue in my house. Well, it turned out that\nthe Egyptians also killed and mummified ibises and\nburied them with scribes. And a week after I went to the museum, there was an auction for an ibis mummy. And I have it now in my house, still in its bandages, overlooking my desk. And we all know, it's gonna come to life\nand peck out my eyes. - Yeah.\n- And write with my blood. But that is one of the\nrecent cool additions. Another thing I have,\nwhich is like, in terms of holy crap, I've made it, I have an original Patrick Nagel painting, and if people don't know the name, he's like the '80s artist. He did \"Duran Duran\" cover. Whenever you see in nail salons. I have a male, which were\nvery rare for him to do. So that's two of my\nkind of favorite pieces. - You have what? - He only drew women predominantly. I have one where he drew\na male, like it was a guy in a, like a jean hat or something. - Hmm. - And now I'm looking forward to, so Jake made me a three foot tall sculpture\ncalled Future Murmur, which I am ecstatic to get. - Just remind yourself\nhow many fascinating, beautiful people that are out there? - And just the victory and\nholiness and technology and speed and how many\npeople have, you know, fought so that I could do what I do. - Yeah. That's another thing I'm grateful for. Just like the 100 billion or\nso people that came before us. - Yeah. - And also the trillions of life forms that came before that. - Oh God, I've gone down this trilobyte\nrabbit hole, buying fossils. 'Cause as a kid I thought\ntrilobytes were the coolest thing. And I've got like 15. - Yeah.\n- And what's interesting is when you buy trilobyte fossils on eBay, they're listed as used, (laughs) because it's gotta be\nnew or used and according to the programming, so it's used. Yeah. - Yeah. But just look, thinking\nabout all that history, just all the life forms that came before, it seems like a really\nspecial thing we have going on Earth here. - Oh, yeah. I think that that's very fair to say. But I also think this\nkind of is like live life to the fullest. You know, Camus talked about\nliving to the point of tears. - [Lex] Yeah. - Especially on behalf\nof people who didn't have that privilege. So, you know, I dedicated\n\"The White Pill\" to my parents who got me out of the Soviet\nUnion and all the kids who never could. And it's like, when I\ndie, I want everyone else to not only, they're obviously\ngonna be happy, but yeah... Like, I'm not here.\nEnjoy, you live for me. 'Cause I can't have\nthat privilege any more. - What do you think\nabout Camus as a writer? - I don't like his novels at all. - Oh, you don't?\n- At all. - Yeah. You've talked shit about \"The\nPlague\" to me a little bit. - Yeah. I think the book is pointless. - It's fascinating... - Because all you need to\ndo is read the synopsis and then you get it. Like, I don't think his book-\n- Isn't that true for most books?\n- No. - I mean, like, you\ncould take, I don't know. I just don't agree at all. I mean, it's \"Catcher in the Rye\". There's a lot of books seem trivial. - I don't think it seems trivial, but I think-\n- \"Animal Farm\". - \"Animal Farm\" is a methodical\nstep-by-step examination of a transformation from\none thing to another. \"The Plague\" is not that. - It's a methodical\nexamination of what a society is like under the plague, which could symbolize a lot of things, including the plague\ndirectly or Nazi Germany or ideological movements or... It's similar to \"Animal Farm\". Maybe not as effective in terms of using this kind of symbol. - I think \"Animal Farm\" has a narrative, and I'm gonna spoil the whole \"Plague\". The book \"The Plague\".\n- Okay. - There's a town I believe in Oman, a plague descends, people\nstruggle to deal with it, and the plague vanishes\nas quickly as it came. The end. - Yeah. But there's the victims, the people that take advantage of it, there's the doctor that amidst\nthe absurdity and the evil of the plague is fighting to do good. - Nothing from me. There's nothing for me. - Okay. Well, I could spoil \"Animal Farm\". There's pigs, there's\nanimals at a farm, (laughs) and the humans are abusing them. And then the animals overthrow the humans. But then the pigs become\njust like the humans. The lesson, kids, is that power corrupts no\nmatter whether you walk on four or on two. - I thought the lesson was that pigs are the most human-like\nanimals on the farm. - I thought the lesson was that there's no sugar candy mountain. - That's right. (laughs) - You've interviewed a lot of people. - [Michael] Yeah. - What have you learned getting\nto the soul of a person? The soul of an idea? From interviewing. Just how to do a good interview? - First off, I'm not\ninterviewing just random people. I'm interviewing people\nwho are accomplished. It's not a random group\nthat's self-selecting for something different. But I think that people love to, and this is very understandable,\nlove to feel seen. So if you're someone who's done something, even if you're like the\nbest guinea pig breeder in America, to have someone\ninterested in your work, and listen to what you're saying... 'Cause I remember every\nbook I've written, you know, I have friends that I wouldn't stop\ntalking about, you know, the person I'm writing with or, you know, the North Korea and at a certain point, I'm sure they're like, all right, I don't care about this any more. But like, it takes over your\nbrain. You know what I mean? So if you, someone who has\nan interest or a hobby, I'm sure to some extent\nmaybe your friends or family are sick of talking about\nit or you don't wanna talk about it with them, you wanna have, that's the private life where\nyou could just be yourself. So I try to, and this comes from my co-authoring\nbackground, when I'm talking to people, to ask the questions that they haven't heard before. There's a possibility that\nthis actor I'm a huge fan of, is gonna be on my show. I don't wanna spoil everything. And he's got a very specific\nrole that he's known for. And I know I'm gonna, I'm\nlike, okay, I'm gonna, I know it's gonna be\nannoying for you talking about this one role, but my goal is to ask\nquestions you aren't sick of, haven't been asked. - Porn star or? - No, not a porn star. - That joke failed also... Edit out. What do you know\nabout breeding guinea pigs? You mentioned it. I'd love to hear. - [Michael] I don't know anything. - I would love to hear more about it. - This is, I always\nuse this as an example. I said, you meet someone at a party who breeds guinea pigs. Right? There's two approaches. Either you're weird, get it? Okay. Or sit down and tell me everything. - Yeah.\n- And I'm very much, and all the people I like\nare the second group. When you meet someone who's\ndoing something unusual and are passionate about\nit and, you know, are good at it, like that to me is the mother lode. - Yeah. That to me also is the\nthing I enjoy the most is like, people that are passionate about- - Because it's who you guys hate? Do you guys hate the hamster people? Do you hate the rabbit people? There's gotta be someone\nthat you guys look down on. Because like the marine\naquarium people look down the freshwater aquarium people. - Yeah. It's a hierarchy.\n- Yes. There's always gonna be a hierarchy. This is where the left\nanarchists and I disagree. 'Cause they think you\ncould have egalitarianism. There's gonna be a hierarchy. - Hierarchies emerge.\n- Yes. - There's no anarchy in\nthe guinea pig world. - [Michael] No. It's just a\ndifferent kind of anarchy. - Somebody's always\nbreeding somebody else. - [Michael] Yes. - And looking down on the others. - If someone's the other. - [Lex] Yeah. - Whether it's the hamster\npeople, the rat people... - And everybody's breeding.\n- Yeah. - Hmm. By the way, are you an anarcho-capitalist? What flavor of anarchist are you? - [Michael] I'm an anarchist\nwithout adjectives. I like them all. The black\nflag comes in many... - All right. All right. You're quoting your own... No, I understand you. It was a beautiful line in the book. - Thank you. I think the anarcho-capitalist don't give the left-anarchists enough credit, especially for their courage. And I do whatever I\ncan in my power to talk about people like Emma\nGoldman, whenever possible. - Do you still think that\nare some people better than others is a good litmus test? - Yes. It's worked 100% of the time. - And for you the answer is yes. - I never answer. - Oh, there's two of them. - (laughs) They're... What, are you getting\nall Hitchcock up in here? - Oh hey, careful. I always got your back. What little habits in\nyour life make you happy, now that you're in Austin?\n- Oh my God. I was prepping for this\ninterview and I imagined this coming up and I knew\nthat as I explain this, you know how sometimes\nwhen someone tells a story, like at first it's\namusing, then it's amusing and concerned, and\nthey're like, holy shit, like where's the exit? - [Lex] Yeah. I'm getting nervous already. - You should. So I'm gonna tell you something I've told only a couple of people. This is my absolutely off the charts autistic approach to shaving. - [Lex] Oh. - So I have this insane system. You asked about habits that gimme joy. I used to hate shaving. I used to hate it. There's something called wet shaving. So wet shaving is, you get the brush, you get the soap that's in a canister. You stir it up, you paint\nyour face and then you shave. The thing is, there are dozens of these shaving soap companies. - Yeah.\n- Okay. So I tried a couple of\nhundred of these soaps. 'Cause you're testing for scent, you're testing for with\nthe lather thickness and also how smooth of\na shave it gives you. - [Lex] Yeah. - I have it down. I'm not making this up.\nI'm not this creative. I have it down to a cycle of 67 soaps. - Yeah.\n- Okay. - So a cycle?\n- A cycle, so 67. - Yeah.\n- When I use up one soap, that is a slot that I\nwill have to try new ones and I will try new ones in\nthat slot until I get one that I like, and then that slot is filled. So right now I have 67 that I\nuse and I have 86 that are... - Candidates. Like in queue. - Candidates.\n- Yeah. - In the queue.\n- Do you label 'em? Do you remember like which one is which? - Well, they all have beautiful labels. I mean, these are artisans who are creating these amazing things. So I would encourage everyone to try this hobby who's a guy. It's so much fun. I will give shout outs to the\ncompanies that are the best. So the best company, in my opinion, is a company called, they just changed the\nname because you know what they're originally called? I'm not joking.\n- Yeah. - Grooming Department. (laughs) And now it's like... - It's not a bad name.\n- Yeah. But it has certain connotations\nin contemporary discourse. - Yeah. Understand.\n- So now he changed- - Contemporary discourse. - He changed his name to\nAion Skincare, A-I-O-N. That's the sense of\nthe most sophisticated, the most diverse... And the soap is just really high quality. Another amazing company\nis Barrister and Mann, and if I'm gonna tell you to\ntry one, it's called Cheshire. He comes out with new\nones every month or so. A lot of it's miss, a lot of it's hit. Just great, great quality stuff. Another great company is Chiseled Face. They make something called Midnight Stag, which basically smells like a garage. It's one of my favorite soaps of all time. - Yeah. What makes for good\nsmell for Michael Malice? - I've 67 answers. So someone that- - [Lex] So you can't put\ninto, convert it into words. - Some are citrusy, some\nare industrial, some... - So garage is more industrial. - It smells like a garage. Yeah. Midnight Stag,\nit smells like garage. Some are fun 'cause they're smells that smell like other things. For example, there's a scent in my queue called Finding Scotty. It smells like Swedish fish. Another great company is Phoenix Shaving. And they have one called Aloha SmackDown. Smells like Hawaiian Punch. They had one called\nYule Ham that they made for me special, smells like a ham. They had a ramen one, Rock and Ramen, smells like cup of noodles. So they're great, and every year they do an advent calendar where you, for 12 days, you have a\nlittle sample of a soap and a sample of the aftershave. - Nice.\n- So those are, I'm forgetting someone\nand I'm feeling angry that I'm doing it. But those are some of the, oh,\nand Caties Bubbles is great. They're vegan, out of New Jersey. They've got one called\nKneehigh to a Grape. It smells like grape soda. I think those are the biggest\nnames off the top of my head. - Will that list converge down\nto a small set eventually? Or no? 67 down to... - Well, no, it's down to, it's 67, so... - Oh, so it always keeps... - Right, so if there's a slot\nthen, you know what I mean? Like, I'll fill that.\nYou see what I'm saying? - Oh, so you'll forever\nhave the variety of 67? - [Michael] Yes. - Huh. You know what, you know\nhow sad my brain is? When you were telling me this, I was like, I wonder how many soaps are\nleft in Michael Malice's life. Like, you can count your\nlife by days, by months, by years, or by soaps. - That is depressing. That is very dark. - Because each experience of shaving is a little beautiful experience. - [Michael] Yes, it is. - And how many do you have\nleft in your life, right? - That's true.\n- Yeah. - I gotta tell you,\nthere's something else. There's a term called, my\nfriend Jackie taught me called touching pan, it's a makeup term. So basically when you\nuse it and you could see the bottom, that's like a big moment. - Oh, it's a great thing?\n- Yeah. It's like what's kind of fun? I'm telling you, like people can scoff, it is such a fun, and there's a lot of us online who are into this whole space. It's really, really fun. - When did you first discover this? - Can I curse?\n- Yeah. - Fuck you Cole Striker. Because I was staying at my\nfriend Cole's house in LA. - Yeah.\n- Fuck you Cole. - Fuck you, Cole. - Cole is like one of the\nbiggest hipsters I know. He's got the shirts with the\npearl snaps and everything. And I'm staying at his house\n'cause I was doing Rogan. And he goes, \"Oh, have you heard\nof this wet shaving thing?\" And he goes, \"Look, this one's Proraso.\" That's like the Italian grandpa soap, which is also a great one. And I went down this\nrabbit hole and I'm like, I don't even know how many,\nhow much money I spent on this. And it's all 'cause of him. - Oh. But it's like a happy fuck\nyou, like, fuck you, Cole. - Yeah.\n- I love you Cole. Fuck you. - Yeah, it's just...\n- Thank you. - Yes. - That's a good idea for a tattoo. Fuck you, Cole.\n(Michael laughing) Do you have advice on how to be happy? - Yes. - There's a lot of loneliness\nand sadness in the world. - Here I can give a very easy\npiece of advice that worked a lot for me. Instead of telling yourself that you have these ridiculous\nstandards, tell yourself, I can be better. Right? I don't have to be a great writer. I could be a better writer. I don't have to be a great podcaster. That will never happen. I\ncould be a better podcaster. I could be a better person. I\ncould be a better at the gym. I could be better with my time. And when you regard things in those, and especially if you have\nmetrics that you can go by, you know, I'll run this many miles a day. Things you have control over. Especially as males, when you have this chart\nand the data's telling you you're improving, right away it's like you have this sense of accomplishment. So I think that is a\nreally great way to... And if something is not\nworking in your life, let's suppose you don't\nhave friends, right? There's the internet. How\ndo people make friends? Try things out. What's the\nworst that's gonna happen? You're gonna, things will\nblow up in your face? Well, you'll learn something at least. Don't be afraid of making mistakes. When I was a kid, I was so scared of having\nthings under control, so like, I would never have to get hit\nin the face, metaphorically. And then I realized, and\nyou realized this as well, everyone who's important\ngets hit in the face, look at the president,\nwhoever the president is, it becomes a matter of being strong enough that you could take\ngetting hit in the face. So that is a big important\nswitch in your thinking. - Yeah. There's a Bukowski\nquote I wrote down. \"Sometimes you climb out\nof bed in the morning and you think, I'm not going to make it, but you laugh inside\nremembering all the times you've felt that way.\" - [Michael] Yeah. Yeah. - There's a part of me that's like that. There's some days where I feel\nlike this is the worst day of my life. And then like shortly after, I\nthink, like, chuckle at that. - Yes. - Like just knowing the\nups and downs of the brain and the mind and life and all that. You ever been depressed? - Yeah, of course. I'm more\nanxious than depressed. I don't really get depressed. Like, yeah. But I've been depressed. - Like low points?\n- Yeah. But I distinguish depression\nbetween low points. Right? Like, if things are going\nbad and you feel bad, that makes sense. But when I think of depression, I think of someone who feels\nbad when things aren't bad. Like, to me, it's like almost by\ndefinition, irrational. - Well, yeah. And there's different kinds of, like, there's a exhausted kind of\ndepression where you're not... - [Michael] Right. - It's not so much sad as you're not, don't wanna do anything. You don't want to live.\nYou don't want to... - What's the, yeah.\n- What's the point? What's the point?\n- It's a wrap. Yeah. - And like an extreme\nself-critical negativity, which I'm also scared of, 'cause my brain is generally\nvery self-critical. - 'Cause you're not\ntaking enough magnesium. - Do you take it rectally or in the mouth? - You take a rectally. - [Lex] Okay. - But as for the magnesium,\nyou should take it as a pill. - Okay. Well, the way your mom explained\nit then is way different. What are you most afraid of? - Holy crap. I'm trying to think of\nanything I'm afraid of. - You know in \"1984?\" - [Michael] With the, I\nthought like, even just... - Like, if I wanted to\ntorture you, hypothetically... - Well, mission accomplished. You know what, I mean in terms of, I'm scared of increasing authoritarianism, but that's not personal\nand that's something that I don't think is as much of an imminent concern as\nlike, let's say, in Canada. - Are you scared of death?\n- No. - You think Camus was scared of death? - No.\n- He just accepted it as... - Look, I can, I honestly feel like if I died tomorrow, I did pretty good with what I had. Like, I think I did\nthings that matter to me. I think I moved the needle\non things that matter to me. I think I've been a good friend\nto the people I care about. I've saved a couple of lives. So I think it's a very low bar for someone to be able to go to their\ngrave and say, you know, I left the world a better\nplace than I found it. I don't think it's that hard. - You ever been betrayed?\n- Oh, God, yes. Of course. Haven't you? - Not as often as I would've predicted. - Yeah. The Russian upbringing like expects everyone to be like, just, it's a time bomb before the betray. You have been betrayed. Of course. Yeah.\n- Yeah. You value loyalty? - I do. And I also made it a point to not let that betrayal color my future\ninteractions and regard that as the universal or the norm. - [Lex] Yeah. - I think that's very important. - Me too.\n- And also I feel bad. I've gotten Lex enough that\nI feel bad for the person who betrayed me, because it's just like, they didn't need to do this. And at some point, if you\nbetray someone, you know, and you know you're not a good person. I believe that. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like, even if you tell\nyourself there's something I had to do, you still know you had to\ndo a bad thing to someone who didn't deserve it. And that's a really hard pill to swallow. - In my situation, I still think good thoughts and empathize with the people that have done me wrong. - I don't empathize with them,\nbut I sympathize with them. - My English is not good\nenough to know the difference. - Empathizing means you're\nputting yourself in their shoes. Sympathizing means you feel bad\nfor them and wish them well. - Yeah. I wish them well. - Yeah. But I don't put myself like, it's very hard for me to\nempathize with someone who betrays someone that they care about. 'Cause that is something, it's not that just I think\nI'm such a great person. It's that I feel guilt very strongly. So if I did that to\nsomeone who trusted me, I would really, it would fuck\nup my head for a long time. - Yeah. But maybe they were in pain,\nmaybe they were desperate. Maybe their back's to the wall. - Sure.\n- They felt that way. - Sure. Well, that's the sympathy thing. Not really an empathy thing. - Yeah. Yeah. Loyalty is a fascinating thing. - Yes.\n- I value trust a lot. - I know you do. Especially 'cause you're in\nsuch a public, both of us, we're, you know, very public positions. You have to be very careful\nwho you surround yourself with. - It sucks.\n- Does it? - It sucks because it's hard to... I usually just trust everybody. - That's... Okay, that's crazy. - [Lex] But what's the alternative? - To be, have a filter? - Well, I have a filter in\nterms of who I interact with. - [Michael] Okay. - But within the, you know,\nI see the good in people, but then you, in the very rare\ninstances that might turn... - [Michael] Okay. - And yeah, it just\nsucks. It breaks my heart. - Yeah. I hear you. I completely agree. - Has your heart ever been broken? - Yes. - Love?\n- Yes. - I'm just so relaxed right now. - Good.\n- And happy. Relaxed and happy. - Good. - This is making me really happy. It's so, again, it's beautiful on like\neight different levels. - I think that's the deepest\nthing I'm thankful for. It's just how beautiful\npeople are and how beautiful the world is. - I really, and people are gonna laugh and I welcome it, that's fine. I really sometimes feel like the guy in \"American Beauty\" looking\nat the plastic bag dancing in the wind and he's brought to tears 'cause of how much beautiful life is. And a lot of people feel the\nneed to sneer at that scene. And Ricky Fitts, whatever. And I think he's got it exactly right. - I think he does too. Well, in the end, you and\nI'll be both laughing. - That's exact, and right. And also seeing beauty where\nother people see garbage. And I'd rather be the\nperson who sees beauty than the person who sees garbage. - Yep. Well, when I look at you, I see beauty, when most people see garbage. And it's really unfair, Mr. Parrot, that you keep saying that. But all jokes aside, man, I'm really grateful for your friendship, and I'm really grateful\nfor you are as a person. Thank you so much for talking today. Thank you so much for talking to me throughout all these years. Thank you for being who you are. - You are welcome. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Michael Malice. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with\nsome words from André Gide. \"Man cannot discover new oceans\nunless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore. Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time.\""
