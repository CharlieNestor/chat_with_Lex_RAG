      "text": "- For me, cooking is an art. - What's your favorite\ningredient to cook with? - There isn't one. It's more like... When there is one, it really is one. You know? Like there's peaches on\nthe cover of this cookbook. Those peaches, those were in August. Colorado peaches. It just doesn't get any better than that. - On that day, at that\nmoment, that was the best. - That was the best. But that only lasts for a week. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then they don't taste so great. - Yeah. (Lex chuckles)\n(Kimbal laughs) But damn are they so good in that moment, and you just can't stop\nwanting to use that ingredient. - The following is a\nconversation with Kimbal Musk. A long time entrepreneur and chef, and author of a new cookbook, called \"The Kitchen Cookbook:\nCooking for Your Community.\" You should check it out. It is in fact, the first\ncookbook I've ever owned. I've already made stuff\nfrom it, and it's delicious. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Kimbal Musk."

      "section": "Growing up in South Africa",
      "text": "Growing up in South Africa, you\nsaid it was a violent place. What are some formative moments that you remember from that time? - South Africa was... So, I grew up in apartheid South Africa, but more specifically\nthe fall of apartheid. So I was a teenager in the '80s. And our community would... Part of our social life, frankly, was the anti-apartheid protests, and to go be with white\npeople, Black people, kind of mixing it all altogether. The most formative experiences, frankly, how much I appreciate\na place like America, where we have value for human life. So that was a country where\nhuman life was not valued. It was a weird thing to\ncome from that to here, where we take it so seriously if someone dies in a war\nor something like that. And we just didn't take it\nseriously in South Africa. People died, or people were killed. I saw someone killed in front of me. I was getting off a train, and it's a very violent\ntrain, known for violence. We were stupid kids. We didn't really listen to our parents. We went on this train,\nand the doors opened, and I had people trying\nto get off the train. And in front of me, two Black people. One Black guy just stabbed this knife in the side of this\nother Black guy's head. And you're like, \"What the fuck?\" And you just... I gotta get off the train. - How old were you at this time? - Probably 16 or 17. And I gotta get off the train. And everyone is trying\nto get me to get off, because, you know, they're all behind me. So I step off, and I step\ninto the pool of blood, one foot, and then I just\nwalk for about 100 paces while the stickiness of\nthe blood just kind of, from my sneakers, just on one foot, just like leaves a footprint behind me. And you just walk on. You just walk on. - [Lex] Did the others walk on as well? - Everyone walked on. - That's an interesting point you make. Underlying the violence is a kind of... Philosophy that human life is disposable, the individual life is disposable. I mean, that underlies many ideologies. You know, I grew up in the Soviet Union. The value of human life was lower there than in the United States. The value of the individual in the United States is really high. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - There's probably an index\nyou can put together, like- - [Kimbal] Yeah, right, exactly. - Per nation. That's a really interesting way to put it, because violence is much\neasier on a mass scale. Suffering, causing\nsuffering on a mass scale is much easier when you\ndon't value the human life. - I've heard this before, where,\nwhich I think I agree with, is when someone is killed,\nsomeone's taken from our lives, the vacuum that it creates, the social vacuum is\nextraordinarily painful. And it truly is true. I mean, if someone in my\ncommunity passes away, it'd be very, very sad for me. And when you go to a place where... Live, grow up in a place\nwhere that human life is not valued, there's something about the... There's a little bit less of\nthe social vacuum created, because everyone is kind of expecting everyone to potentially be\ntaken out at any moment. But then there's also a\nbeauty to it because... There's a much more of\na celebratory element. My cousin Russ and I,\nagain, we're stupid kids, we shouldn't be doing this. But we'd go into the townships, where a lot of the violence\nwould be happening. And we really didn't see\nmost of the violence there. It was in these more\nprotests and so forth. But there's a joy that also comes from lower value of human life. There's a real joy. Like everyone was like, \"Well...\" I mean, it's beautiful. We'd have dinner with\nBlack friends, you know? Friends with their family, and\nwe were still pretty young. And there was just a real joy to it. - When you accept mortality- - [Kimbal] Yeah. (laughs) - You can really enjoy life. - You can really enjoy life. I mean, I think that's\nactually quite a nice insight. I've never really put it that way, but I think that's right actually. I think you just chill out a bit, take things a little less seriously. - \"Cause life does end for everybody. - It does, right? (laughs) - And if you just head\non accept that fact. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - You can just enjoy every single moment, and let go of this attachment,\nand just enjoy the moment. - I think there's a real... I do love that we all\nlive longer and so forth, but we should live longer\nwith the goal of joy. - [Lex] Mhm. - The goal of happiness and peace. Not... Some form of misery that you\nchoose to attach yourself to. - Maximize joy. - Maximize joy, that's right. - There's a story that Walter\nIsaacson writes about where Elon got beat up pretty\nbad, and you were there, and then you also had to watch your dad yell at Elan for an hour, calling him worthless,\nall those kinds of things. You said it was the worst\nmemory of your life. What do you make of such cruelty? What do you remember from that time? - I mean, it was horrible. I think, you know,\ncoming back to the point of low value of human life... They tried to kill him. There was no holding back,\nso I just watched someone... It wasn't just one, but\nthere was a main person, and then there was a few\nothers that piled in. They just... They tried to kill him, in front of me. We were eating sandwiches on\na staircase at the school, in the outdoor staircase and... I just had to... They were not coming after me, and then I just had to\nwatch, and I couldn't help. It was one of the saddest,\nmost difficult experiences. It was just awful. - Just like that, life can end. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - It could've been you. - Yeah, I think... So I've had a near death\nexperience where I almost died. It was in 2010. And I think that... And I broke my neck, and I can go into that story in a moment. But this was different. This was... This comes back to the low\nvalue of human life part, where if someone had killed my brother, if that person had beat him to death, which he was trying to do, life would've gone on. You know, that's like an insane\nthought in an American... Well, maybe in some tough neighborhoods, but for the most part, it's not a thing. - Yeah, the brutality of that. The mundaneness of the brutality. - Yeah. - It makes you think of\nall the places in the world that that's happening. - [Kimbal] Exactly, exactly. - And all the beautiful\npeople that just disappear. - I always say to people who\nhave an opinion about America that, you know, this is a\nreally bad country or whatever. And I say, \"Look, please\ngo try another country before you say that.\" Not to say that America can't get better. But please go try another country. Because not having that perspective, or having a perspective that... I don't know, like a\nchip on their shoulder about the country that they're in... Okay, go try another country, and then come back and tell me. And pick any country. It doesn't have to be\nsome very violent country. You could pick any country. And you just realize that actually, the world doesn't think the\nsame way that America thinks. And you're gonna just learn\na perspective that, I think, gives you a better way to\ncritique where we live in America. - Yeah, it's humbling. You said that your dad was a\nrollercoaster of affection, and then verbal abuse. Walter Isaacson quotes\nBarack Obama who said, \"Someone once said that every\nman is trying to live up to his father's expectations or make up for his father's mistakes, and I suppose that may\nexplain my particular malady.\" Does part of that ring true for you? - What I thought you were gonna say was... I thought you were gonna\nend the sentence with, \"Live up to my father's expectations.\" That's what most people say. But then you said the second part, which is make up for his mistakes. And I think that's actually... That one rings true for me. He was really... He's still alive, but\nI'm not connected to him. But he's very... He taught me, the phrase I used to have, was he taught me what not to do. So I still actually learned a lot. What kind of human not to be, what kind of actions not to take. And so that kind of, closer\nto living up to his mistakes, but my father's such a train wreck that it's not really mistakes. It's like, intentional\nactions of what not to do. \"Okay, look, don't do that.\" - But there's still the\ntrauma of that, you know, it has an effect on the human psychology, and can permeate through time. So it has probably\ncomplex indirect effects on who you are. The good and the bad. - There's a critique\nthat my friends give me, which is when they're talking to me, I kind of just drift away. I'm still looking at them. I'm still nodding. Might even respond to them\nin their conversation. But I'm actually not there. And I've realized that\nI actually, I grew up, 'cause my father would just... Verbal abuse is one way to say it. It is abuse, but it's more just\nverbal diarrhea, for hours. And constantly saying,\n\"Do you understand?\" Like, he wants to make sure\nthat I'm paying attention. So I train myself to look\nlike I'm paying attention, but I'm not. - To disappear to some place. - Disappear to some place. - [Lex] Wherever that is. - Yeah. And I do that less and\nless over time, but I- - But that path has been\npaved somewhere in your mind at childhood, so... It could be easy to walk down it. You and Elon were close growing up. You're still close. What did you learn from each other? How did you compliment each other? - Yeah, I think we're a good compliment. I'll talk for myself first. My strength is definitely\non the social side. I love the gathering place. And I love putting people\ntogether in person. And I love to have vibrant\ndebates and conversations. I've been doing that forever, including fun parties and stuff, where I bring people together, and I really kind of\nwant people to have fun, but be vulnerable, not\njust like silly partying, but actually like, let's all connect. The definition for me of a good party is people laugh and cry. Like, I wanna have people\nhave an emotional connection. I go to Burning Man every year, and there's no question you will cry at some point during Burning Man. - No small talk. - No small talk. Yeah, exactly. No small talk. - [Lex] Yeah. - You're totally right.\nUnlike most parties... Not parties, but most events\nyou go to are like clubs, these sort of nightclubs. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I never go to those. And my joke is... Why would I wanna go to a place where I pay to shout\nsmall talk in the dark? (Lex and Kimbal laughing) - That's a good line. That's what it feels like. The only the reason I enjoy those places is the full absurdity of exactly that. (Kimbal laughs) - Right. It's totally absurd. - What are we doing? What is this? What is this like? (Lex chuckles) - So, my compliment for my brother, was just bringing joy\nand social connection. And he's truly... He's an engineering genius. I've worked with him forever. And we do compliment each other."

      "section": "Cooking",
      "text": "- You just came out with\na cookbook, by the way. Thank you for giving me my first cookbook. I feel legit. - [Kimbal] I love that\nit's your first cookbook. - I'm gonna keep it... (Kimbal laughs) I'm gonna keep it on the counter, and it's gonna give me legitimacy\nwhen anyone comes over. Hey, listen, I'm basically a chef now. - [Kimbal] That's right. (Lex chuckles)\nExactly. - When did you first fall\nin love with cooking? - I started cooking\nwhen I was 11 years old. My mom is just, she's wonderful, but she's self-admittedly a bad cook. But at the time, I think anyone with kids\nthat goes through this. Your kids just want like something that, like spaghetti bolognese\nor a burger or something. And my mom would do brown bread, plain yogurt and boiled squash. You know, like the absolute\nmost disgusting things that a child could imagine eating. And so I said, \"Can I cook?\" And she said, \"Yeah, if you\nwanna cook, no problem.\" So I went to the grocery store... And back in those days, the butcher was separate\nto the grocery store. And I went to the butcher,\nand I said, \"What can I cook?\" And he pulled out a chicken, and he said, \"This is the\neasiest recipe for you. Just put it on a pan in\nan oven, a hot oven.\" 'Cause back then, ovens\nweren't necessarily like 400 degrees or 450 or whatever. \"And put it in a hot oven\nfor one hour and enjoy.\" That was it. And so I went home. And actually, I also\nbought some french fries, I'll tell you that as well. So I'm a kid, of course\nI want french fries. So I had roast chicken with french fries. And the chicken came out,\nand it was just fantastic. - It was? - Absolutely fantastic. - That's incredible, by the way. - [Kimbal] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You didn't screw it up the first time. - First of all, I think that\nalso kicks off the magic. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like if you screw it\nup, and you're like, \"Oh, maybe this is not for me.\" So for me, it really did kick it off. (Lex laughs) - You started out on a high note. - Yeah, right, exactly. But I can tell the french fry\npart, which was a disaster. So I cooked the french fries, but I didn't heat the oil first, so I just put the potatoes in the oil, and I waited for it to heat up. And I just was throwing\nup later that night. 'Cause your body can't ingest that much, 'cause it sucks the oils in. - Oh, oh, wow. - And so that was a disaster, but at the time it tasted good. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) The real magic, which I\nalso found was wonderful, was when I cooked, you know,\nmy brother and my sister, my mom all very, very\nbusy, very intense people, would sit down, and we\nwould have a meal together. And I was like, wow, this\nis a very powerful thing that I've now got, where in no other way could I have that\nconnection with my family. I mean, obviously we stay connected, we're very close, et cetera, but in no other way can we sit down and just talk about things. Or talk about whatever's on our mind, or just to just not even talk, just to be at the table together. And I've done that now\nthrough my whole life. My kids, still for my family. And we will do gratitudes at\nthe beginning of our meal. And it's just... I think that what kept me cooking, what made my love of cooking so great, was actually the fact\nthat we would sit down- - [Lex] Together. - And be present with each other. And I'm also just also\nhorrible with that too, so I also get to be present. - What is that about food that like, brings people together,\nand not just together, but like really together, where you're like paying attention? - [Kimbal] Right. - Like, what is that? Why is it food? Like, what else does that? Sometimes maybe alcohol can do that, which is a kind of food, I\nguess, as part of the experience. - Yeah, but I think alcohol is different because you're usually standing when you're doing alcohol,\nso like you're socializing, but it's gonna stay in more\nof the small talk zone. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Right? - Whereas if you sit down.... And I see this in my restaurant\nin The Kitchen in Boulder, where we have every viewpoint. Or we go to Denver, every viewpoint. When we're in Chicago, every viewpoint. And the physical presence of someone being with right there, is people, they're just very different. Absolutely different to\nwhat they are online. I think we all know the\ndifference between, you know, you send an email to someone, and they misunderstand the email, right? And you're like, \"Oh, if I\nhad just talked to the person, it would've been fine.\" Well, this is now happening at scale. You know, with all of these... What do you call it? Trolling or whatever. And I've sat at the bar, and I've had a hardcore Trump supporter. And I'm just curious, just like, \"Listen, tell me... I'm not a Trump supporter,\nbut like, tell me more.\" And it actually draws\nthe conversation out, because you're there\nfor an hour or longer. (Kimbal chuckles) So there's no rush to get the answer. And I think that's a big difference. I've had one time where,\njust a couple months ago, I had someone, I was sitting\nat the community table, we have a community\ntable in the restaurant. And I didn't know him too well, but he asked me, \"Did I know\nthat 9/11 was a conspiracy, and it didn't really happen.\" - [Lex] It didn't happen, yeah. - And I was like, \"Huh.\" So actually, I was at 9/11. I mean, I watched the towers fall. I was there, physically there. So it's like, no- - Allegedly. - There's no doubt in my mind. - Okay. - But I didn't wanna... (Kimbal and Lex chuckling) But I didn't wanna interrupt\nwhat he had to say. So I let him talk for five minutes, six minutes, seven minutes. And again, you're there for a while, so you're not in a rush\nto jump in and argue. And then I shared that I was there. And I think because I had\nbeen willing to listen to him, he was willing to listen to me. And I don't know if he changed his mind. He certainly didn't change my mind. But it was actually a\npretty cool conversation, to kinda get into each other's mind. - Well, I think you connect\non a different level, not on the level of like the conspiracy, but on the level of basic humanity. - Yes, exactly. - Like that's what you really connect on. And then it almost becomes\ninteresting and fun that you can exchange\nideas, even crazy ideas, out there ideas, and\nkind of play with them. Like, we humans are good at that. - Yeah, exactly. I like the term \"play with them\". Because what you're not trying to do is shut the conversation down. You're also not trying to- - [Lex] Talk down on them. - Yeah, exactly. Like, \"Oh, this guy's... Let me just be nice while I totally disagree\nwith this person.\" You can do that for a few minutes, you can't do that for two hours. - And there's something\nabout food that completely... I don't know, it must be evolutionary, that it makes us vulnerable in a way, that even just standing there for a prolonged period of time doesn't. There's something about... (Lex chuckles) You know like, when the animals gather to the water or whatever. - [Kimbal] Yeah, right. - Like this kind of experience\nwhere you're just like, \"All right, let's just\nacknowledge together that we need sustenance.\" - Yup. - And somehow that kind\nof grounds us to like, we're just a bunch of descendants of apes. (Kimbal laughs) Here just kinda like,\ngrateful to be alive. - [Kimbal] Yeah.\n- Frankly. And grateful to be consuming this thing which keeps us alive. And in that context, you can\ntalk about all kinds of stuff. You can discuss Flat Earth and enjoy it. - Absolutely. Abso... In fact, one of my favorite things to do, is you do like a\nJeffersonian style dinner. Like let's say five or six people. Sometimes people will break off into individual conversations. That's actually when things break down. So that's when you kinda\ngo back to small talk. Like, \"Oh, I'm stuck next to this guy, I'm just gonna do a little small talk.\" What you need to do to really create a great conversation is, one conversation at the table. And that's where, you know, there'll be some simple\nquestions that I'll say. I'll say, \"What's your middle name?\" And you'll be amazed at the\nstories you get from that. But it's about creating vulnerability. - [Lex] Yeah. - So they're like, \"Oh, no one's\never asked me that before.\" So then they become vulnerable. And then something as simple as, \"What's the most fun thing\nyou've done recently, and what is the most fun thing\nyou're looking forward to?\" - [Lex] Mhm. - And I have gotten into... With those prompts, I've gotten into hours long discussions on God. - [Lex] Mhm. - I've gotten into hours\nlong discussions on love. I've got into hours long\ndiscussions on anger. It's actually amazing when people are just asked a question like, \"What's the most fun\nthing you've done lately?\" Well, why would anger come up? Well, actually, they're\nin a vulnerable place, so that it'll just kind\nof come out of them. - So you get to see this. You get to see this at The Kitchen. And you said Boulder, Denver, Chicago? - Yeah, and we're gonna open in Austin. - In Austin. That's what I saw. When? When? - In October is the goal. - In October is the goal. Well, I mean, speaking of\ncharacters and human beings, Austin is fascinating. I've... I forget how long ago, I mean, a couple months ago, I\nwas just sitting at a bar, and the two people were talking, and they were talking about Marxism. And it turns out that\nthey're anarcho-communists? Which is a thing? And I got into this conversation- - A communist that likes drugs? (Lex and Kimbal laughing) - That's a good question to ask. (Kimbal and Lex laughing) - I think I know some of those. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) - Anyway, they were beautiful people. I think they're local from Austin. I don't know the depth of\ntheir personal experience of the different kinds of\ncommunist-like systems, but it was fascinating to listen to, and then get to know them. And the humanity, the\nweirdness, like the characters. It's just... I mean, I love it. One of the reasons I really love Austin, I decided to be here, is just the cliche thing\nof \"Keep Austin Weird\". I mean, there's a lot of weird characters. - I love it. I think... I've talked to a lot of Austinites\nwho've been here forever, and I'm like, \"Man, you\ngotta hold us accountable. We gotta keep this place weird.\" (Lex laughs) - A hundred percent. Which makes the restaurant seem great, because you have all\nthese characters come in. It's great. So I look forward to that. But you were saying like, you get to see humans\nin real life interact. That's one of the beautiful things. - Yeah.\n- Over food. In the book you write, Picasso once said, \"The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.\" Then you wrote that you\nbelieve food is a gift we give ourselves three times a day. Can you explain that? The gift nature of it? - Yeah, it's actually... I think it's one of my\nmost powerful life lessons, is we have to eat. So it's not like you have a choice. You have to eat. And so what I choose to do is, I'm gonna choose to make it a\ngift to myself for each meal. And most of the time, the best gift is with\nfriends, with family. So I'll have to cook some scrambled eggs in the morning with my daughter, or we'll have dinner with our family. To me, it's a gift we give\nourselves three times a day, you know, at least. But for the most part, three times a day. Let's make it a good one. - What makes it a good one to you? Like, what aspect makes it a good one? - Well, first definitely\neating with people. So, that makes it a good one. So eating in a restaurant, it doesn't have to be my restaurant. where you have the energy\nof people around you, energy of the town, people you don't know. It creates a little bit of a vibe. You mentioned the watering hole analogy, the animals like sipping at the water. But there's an energy to that\nbecause they're also like, looking around going, \"Am\nI just about to be eaten?\" - Yeah. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) - So they're all in it together, but we need to have water. But there's still a little\nbit of tension as well in the background. And I think that's what restaurants do. A very, very subtle version of that. You're in a room with strangers. And you're a little cluster, okay, fine. You guys are connected and... - [Lex] Yeah. - But you're in a room with strangers, and there's just something that adds that energy to the meal. - Yeah, you're a little\nbit wondering like, \"What does everyone else think\nabout our little cluster?\" - Right. Like, are we too loud? Or just, also just people are random, so something random could happen. - And also, depending on your personality, if you're an extrovert, maybe you wanna show off\nto the other clusters. - Exactly, yeah. Absolutely. Totally right. I mean, you know... Look at the cowboy hat. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) I mean, actually, I'll take my hat off when I wanna have a quiet meal, and I can leave my hat on when I'm- - Oh, so you're aware of the- - I'm aware of the effect it has. Yeah, absolutely. - Everyone turns in the night. (Kimbal laughs) - [Kimbal] That's right. - And then it's back to the watering hole. 'Cause when you wear a cowboy hat, you just might actually not- - Yeah, yeah, I'm like... They're gonna get me first. (Kimbal and Lex laughing) - At noon. I love it. - I gotta tell this story. We talked to the craziness of\nbeing in the restaurant world, where, you know, you're\nsitting at a table, and anything can happen in the restaurant. So there's one time, it\nwas like 15 years ago, this guy comes up to us and says he'd like to propose to\nhis wife, his girlfriend. And so we said \"Okay, cool. We've done this before. We'll make sure it's all set up.\" 6:00 PM kind of reservation. So she shows up, and we give\nher a glass of champagne. We didn't, obviously, didn't\nwanna spoil a surprise, so we're just doing everything we can. But then he doesn't arrive. (Lex laughs) And then we're like, \"Oh, man.\" Now we're like, \"Don't leave! Can we get you another\nglass of champagne?\" We're doing everything we can, because the guy was\nobviously earnest earlier. We're just, \"Is he stuck\nin traffic or whatever?\" And out coming through the\nback door of the restaurant, which, you're not allowed to come through the back door of the restaurant, a marching band from the\nschool, the university, like comes through the\nrestaurant, you know, full on brass band and the whole thing. And he gets down, and he proposes... And it's beautiful, sure, but it's also like-\n- [Lex] Chaos. - Man, this is chaos. This is insane. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) And we would never have said yes to this if he'd actually told\nus what he was gonna do. - Yeah, well, sometimes in life, you have to do it and apologize. - You do it and apologize. But that talks to that kind of, what's a crazy thing that could happen... It's subtle, but it's still there. - So in 2004, you opened The Kitchen. It's an American bistro restaurant. What was it like, what's it\nlike running a restaurant? The good, the bad and the ugly? What's the easy, what's the\nfun, and what's the hard? - I think the thing that I absolutely love about running the\nrestaurant, not eating in it, but running the restaurant, is the tangible reaction from people. And you also kind of know\nwhen you've screwed it up, and you also know when you got it right. It's kind of a weird way to say this, but even if the customer's unhappy, you know whether you\ngot it right or wrong. It's not just about\nthe food you're making, but it's about the person's\npsychological state. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you'll do something\nthat you're like, you know that was not done well. And their psychological state is they're just in a very\nhappy place, and they love it. And you're like, \"Huh, interesting.\" Like, that's not how I\nwould've reacted to that dish. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then the other way around. You're like, \"No, I got that right\" And that person's just\nlike really unhappy today. - Yeah. And it's so hard to read humans. 'Cause you have to... If you got it right, that can look a million different ways, depending on the emotional rollercoaster that human is living through. Like I've been at some very low points, and I've gone to like a restaurant alone, and just sitting there and be truly happy with just the zen aspect of it. And it was just like a great\nsteak or something like this. And maybe to other people around me, would look like I'm very unhappy, just because I'm within myself. - [Kimbal] Struggling with your day, yeah. - Yeah, within myself. But I'm truly happy\nwithin that struggle, so. Yeah, it's interesting. But you can kind of tell. - Yeah, you can tell. You mentioned being at the bar. The most gifted bartenders\nreally understand that. You know, it goes beyond... What's also great about a restaurant, it goes beyond the one time\nexperience that you walk in and have that experience. Is the good bartenders, they remember you. \"Oh, you were in a few months ago.\" And... \"This is kind of your thing,\nyou might need a little time.\" And other people will come\nin, they want a conversation. - [Lex] Yeah. - Or other people come in, and they're going through a divorce, and they just wanna be sad for a moment. Have a scotch.\n- [Lex] Yeah. (Lex chuckles) - And it's amazing what you\nlearn in the restaurant world, to just be connected to humanity. - Yeah. What is that about bars? That's a different experience. You said the table, the communal- - The table is when you\nconnect with people, learn about each other. Bars, you can sometimes do that. You can talk left and right, but you have the freedom\nto always break free. Like you can say, \"Oh, okay, great, I'm gonna go back to my meal.\" So it's kinda like a friend you can turn on and off at any time. Because the bartender knows\nthat, they're trained. Like if you want attention,\nI'm gonna give it to you. If you don't, I'm gonna stay away. If you wanna be chatty,\nI'm gonna be chatty. If you wanna be completely in your head, I'll leave you in your head. - There's also strangers\nkinda next to you, that you kinda... There's a feeling with the bar, that you're kind of alone together. - [Kimbal] Yeah.\n- Right? - And you can reach out. You can add some conversation,\nor you can choose not to. - And you can exit quickly. - You can exit. Exactly.\n(Lex laughing) It's a really good exit. So, bars are wonderful. And I love going to a bar\nby myself, after work. I might have a scotch, might\neven not even have alcohol, just have some thing. And maybe have a snack or\nsomething before dinner, because I'm gonna go home and\nhave dinner with the family. And that 20 minutes is just\nan amazing state change, from daytime to nighttime. Whereas if I went straight home, I'm like still in my head, and I'm just trying to get grounded, and I'm not as pleasant of a person. So that's another powerful use of a bar, is just like a transition time. - Well, I mean, it would\nbe remiss not to mention the other use of the bar, which is like, when you're going through\nsome shit in life. And you just go. I mean, it's the cliche thing. I've been... - Writing your stories? - Yeah, exactly. (Kimbal laughing) - But like the bar makes the melancholy somehow like rich and beautiful, and like you feel heard in the silence. - Yes.\n(Lex laughing) Yes, you feel heard. Like I said earlier, people\ngoing through a divorce, they don't know where else to go. - [Lex] Yeah. - These are mostly men. Sometimes women will do it,\nbut mostly men will do this, and women have other\nways of processing it. But they just... They want a place to be sad. They want a place where they could feel comfortable talking about it. They're certainly not gonna\ngo into too much detail, but they just wanna say something. - [Lex] Yeah. - And the bartender is there for them. - Yeah. You don't know where to go. - You don't know where to go, exactly. - And the bar... (Kimbal laughs) Yeah, you're right. Like for men especially,\nis a place to just go. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - And just... I don't know. What is that? - I mean-\n- What is that? - I'll be honest, I still do it myself, where if I'm at home, and I don't have a work\nthing that I gotta deal with, and I don't have kids,\nand I don't have my wife or a family around, I don't often cook for myself. I actually love going to a bar, by myself. I have a glass of red wine, and I usually don't have\na starter or appetizer, just like a main meal. And I just take in the\nenergy of the space. If it's my restaurant,\nsomeone else's restaurant. I just take in the energy. And it's so much better\nthan being home and, what, turn the TV on? No, no, no, no, no. I wanna be out in the restaurant. I wanna feel the energy of the town. The other thing that\nrestaurants teach me is, they're the front lines of the economy, or what's a better word for it? Just like front lines of the\nenergy of how things are going. - Oh, like, of a peoples in general? Like, it doesn't necessarily\nmean this part of town, but it could be the entire society. - Yeah, exactly. So you can go into a restaurant and... I'll use a simple example. And why is the restaurant empty? Ah, there's a football game going on. And there's such a large number of people that wanna watch that game, that the restaurant is quiet. Or it might be like World\nSeries or something. And you're like, \"Wow,\nthat's so interesting.\" You can actually watch,\nin American of course, American humanity, you can watch them move in their patterns, just by being in the restaurant. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - And then another time you\nmight be in a restaurant, and it's just jamming. And it's a Monday night, and you're like, \"What is the energy that\ncreated this on a Monday night?\" And maybe even on a cold February,\nMonday night, what is it? And sometimes you can't find\nout, but you could feel it. And it's my front lines of humanity that I also just really\nlove about the restaurants. - Yeah, it could be\nempty, it could be full. Empty bars... There's a magic to those too. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - You could still feel that energy. I don't know. - I actually prefer empty\nbars than full ones. - It's just you and the bartender. I mean, some of my greatest experiences is just the quiet bar, with just me and the bartender, and they're doing their thing. And they've seen so many... I have almost like,\nthrough osmosis somehow, feel the stories that\nthat bartender has seen, has felt, has heard. - [Kimbal] Yeah.\n- And all that kind of stuff. I mean, not to be sort of... Like spiritual about it, but it seems like it's in\nthe walls or something. Like the history is felt. - And then some of these\nbars are actually very old, and it's wonderful. Like, there are many in Europe like this, but there's a couple in New York City, few hundred years old, and they're still operating\nnonstop for that long. And man, you feel it. - Yeah. Let me ask you some\nquestions about ingredients."

      "section": "Ingredients",
      "text": "What's your favorite\ningredient to cook with? - For me, cooking is an art, right? So it'd be like asking me what's my favorite paint color to use. It's not there isn't one, it's more like when there\nis one, it really is one. You know, like there's peaches on the cover of this cookbook. Those peaches, those were\nin August, Colorado peaches. It just doesn't get any better than that. - On that day, at that\nmoment, that was the best. - That was the best. But that only lasts for a week. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then they don't taste so great. - Yeah.\n(Kimbal laughs) But damn are they so good in that moment, and you just can't stop\nwanting to use that ingredient. - They look really good. - [Kimbal] They're so good. - What's your favorite fruit? I love veggies and fruit. What's your favorite fruit? - I love a smoothie bowl,\nso I do sort of berries, raspberries... But I use fruit more in\nthe form of a smoothie bowl than I eat fruit that often. I like an apple or a banana, but for the most part, I\nprefer like the blended. - Not me. I love... The way you casually\nsaid, \"I like an apple.\" I mean- - A good apple is pretty great. - For me, it's a problem, I think. (Kimbal laughs) Probably cherries number one. Probably... What are they called? Granny Smith apples number two. - Oh yeah, those are great. But try it when... Sometime, come to Colorado in August, and when you try those peaches, it is like heaven has\narrived in your mouth. It is so ridiculously good. (Kimbal laughs) - But just for a week in August. - Just for a week. You can't have it all year long. (Kimbal laughs) - What about veggies? You wrote that Chef Hugo\nthat you worked with, co-founded The Kitchen with, taught you the power of a good vegetable. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - What's the power of a good vegetable? - So I've trained in New York, right? As a French chef. But it wasn't very much\ningredients focused, it wasn't very much sourcing focused. He came from the River Cafe in London, which was one the OGs\nof the farm-to-table, and still going strong today. And he taught me the value\nof getting to know farmers, and getting to know\nvegetables from that farm, versus vegetables from that farm. And they're actually different. The soil's a little different. The way they grow it a little different. It's the opposite of\nthe industrial machine, where everything needs\nto look exactly the same. And sometimes you'll get carrots that are kinda ugly and deformed, but they're much sweeter than the carrots you'd get for other purposes. So you'd make a carrot puree out of that. And then you take carrots that are more typical in shape and size, you might roast them for dinner. So it's the appreciation\nfor vegetables in general. I probably would say\ncarrots is my favorite, just 'cause that was an example of one where I really had to learn how to use the different types of carrots that come from from all of our farms. And it's fun. You know, it's a fun ingredient. If you just went to the Whole Foods, or just went to a grocery store, and you just got exactly\nthe same carrot every time, less fun. But go to a farmer's market\nand see what you get, and you'll see they're quite different. - Yeah, carrot for me\nis probably number one. I have rigorous detailed\nrankings for fruit and veggies. - [Kimbal] That's amazing! - We'll get into it. No, I'm just kidding. (Kimbal laughs) Well, I am the kind of person that would have like a\nspreadsheet for that. - [Kimbal] That's great. - But I'm mostly just\nmaking fun of myself. I do love carrots. I wish they weren't so\nfull of carbs, but... - Yeah, I'm just not anti-carbs, you know? I think-\n- Anti-carbs, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, I think they play a role. Like, I have a great friend\nwho's an amazing doctor, and he did some tests\nfor me and everything, and turns out I have a gluten allergy. And I was like, \"Okay. So what that means is,\nI shouldn't eat gluten.\" He's like, \"Yeah.\" It's like, okay, but\nI also have hay fever, and that means I should\nnot go out into nature. So I was like, nah, I think\nI'm gonna go out into nature. And maybe what I'll do\non bread and pasta is, or like the true carbs, I'll just have it when it's really good. - [Lex] Mhm. - Because when it's really\ngood, it's really good. And you don't wanna miss that. Most of the time, okay, fine, there's some crummy bread or whatever. Like, I can skip that part. But I find all of these\ndiets, they're like, \"No, none of this.\" Or, \"Super this, super that.\" I wonder if people are just looking for something to hang on to. But these diets have been around forever, and if they work, then we would know that. - Yeah, I think one of the\nbiggest problems with diets is, it adds stress when you do have\nthat perfect bowl of pasta. And if you have categorized yourself as a low-carb eating person, you might be very stressed\nabout enjoying this thing. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - When you should just let go. - Let go. This is your \"cheat day\" or whatever. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - And I've heard that. And actually, I have friends\nwho do that, their cheat day, and I say to them, \"I'm only gonna hang out\nwith you on your cheat day, because that's when you're actually fun.\" (Kimbal and Lex laughing) - Yeah, I mean, I would say like for me, there's things that make\nme feel really good, but they're not rules. They're not... They're like go-to favorites. Like in terms of diet and so on. For example, I've mostly\nbeen eating once a day. - Oh, wow. - For the longest time. But that's not a rule. Like, it's completely flexible. And I've mostly been eating very low-carb. - Okay, but you must\nbe eating a lot of food in that one meal. - Yeah, it's not, you know, because it's usually\nvery sort of meat heavy. It's not like portions\nare not that big, so. - But your body needs food. - Yeah, body needs food. So you're talking about\nlike 2000 calories. What you find out is like, that dinner, is like the most social time of the day. - Yeah. I mean, I have kids in the morning, so if you have kids, it's for\nsure a morning experience, but if you don't, then you're right. - Yeah. But like you said, I deviate. I'm more afraid of missing\nthe perfect dessert, the perfect breakfast,\nthe perfect bowl of pasta, pizza, all that kind of stuff. - [Kimbal] Yeah, right. - I don't think of it as a cheat day. I think it's a... - Well, if you're only\neating one meal a day, you can eat whatever you like. (Kimbal laughs) - Well, like, I wanna make clear that it's not one meal a day always, and on like this very strict thing. It's... You always have to be\nopen to the experience, to the new experience. Otherwise you do miss out. 'Cause just like you said, hay fever. Like, I think if you want be really safe, you should never leave your home. - Yes, just wrap... We learned during COVID, if you wrap yourself in\ncotton wool in your basement- - [Lex] Yes. - You're not going to die from COVID. You might die from a lot of other things, of just pure misery. - Yeah.\n(Kimbal laughs) Well, you might live forever. (Kimbal laughs) - Right? We don't know. - But it certainly\ndoesn't maximize the joy, of whatever makes life worth living. It doesn't maximize that. - Yeah, exactly."

      "text": "- You wrote in the book\nthat Anthony Bourdain was one of your heroes. Can you speak to what\ninspired you about him? - Yeah, he wrote a book called \"Kitchen Confidential\", in the 90s. I was in cooking school at the time. It was so... He romanticized cooking\nin the restaurant so well. His writing is great. So he kind of got me into like, \"Oh, that's cool. I want to do that.\" It was cool. So, you know, got into cooking school, got more engaged in it. And it was like I had\nthis FOMO feeling of, I wanted to experience what\nit's like to be in the back... When you're in cooking\nschool, you are in the back. They had a restaurant,\nwe would serve people. But it's not the same thing\nas actually being in a... A real restaurant, it's\nlike you're in a submarine with your teammates, and\nyou gotta win tonight. Like, it's a real energy. And so, that was a big inspiration. I followed him. It was so sad that he\nchose to end his life. But I also had met with him a few times. Not like one-on-one\nover dinner or anything, but just like, met with him, and just felt his love for food. And truly, just love for food. - He gave the advice of, \"Don't be afraid, get\nexcited and cook with love.\" - Yeah. I've used that phrase, especially\nthe cook with love one. I mean, you know, one of the things about, which we talked about this earlier where, you get quick, tangible\nfeedback from a customer when you're in the restaurant. I know when I didn't\nput love into that dish. I know when one of my line cooks did not put love into\nthat part of the dish. I know when that export\nperson did not put love into, you know, double checking the dish before putting it on the table. You just know. And \"cook with love\" is, whether you do it for your family. Oh, actually, especially when\nyou do it for your family. The food doesn't have to be perfect, but you're cooking with love. - That's why you love scrambled eggs. - I do that, it's- - That's in the book,\nKimbal Scrambled Eggs. - Yes. - You promised to make me scrambled eggs, and I'm gonna hold you to it. - That's great.

      "section": "Cooking school",
      "text": "A cooking school you mentioned. The French Culinary Institute. I heard it was a bit of a\nrough experience in parts. - I would call it... It's not a rough experience in that- - In a beautiful way. - Yeah, exactly. It's not like I'm a victim of it. It's rough in that they\nintentionally make it rough. So the school costs the same\nprice as Harvard to go to. You show up, it's an 18 month program. You are allowed to drop out at any time, you don't get your money back. 25 people started, six people graduated. And the people who graduated... I graduated, but man, there\nwere times where I'm like, \"I can't handle this.\" I mean, I would literally\nsay to my friends, \"Oh, I gotta go to cooking school. I'm gonna go get screamed at for the next six or seven hours.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And I had this little French\nchef, who was my nemesis. - Does he still live\nin your head somewhere? - He still lives in my head. Exactly! He totally does. He's like 5'2\" or something. And I remember him\nscreaming so much at me. He's like the short guy, I'm 6'5\". The spittle would land on my face. - [Lex] Nice. - And I would just have to sit there, or stand there and take it. It was a very humbling experience. I did learn though that\nit's intentionally rough. So it took a little\nbit of the edge off it. One day, when that same\nchef had come over to me and said, \"Move over a little bit.\" And then I moved over. And he took my carrots, whatever, and started just chopping everything. And like perfectly. And then he said, \"Okay,\nnow you can come back.\" And then he went over to someone else, and started screaming\nat them, saying that, \"Look, even Kimbal can do this. And you can't do this.\" And I was like... This whole thing's like a psycho game. - [Le] Yeah.\n(Kimbal laughs) - So it did take the edge\noff when I realized it was... - [Lex] Yeah. - Like the guy was intentionally\ntrying to break you down. And they do this apparently in the Army. I've not been to the Army, but... They need to break you down, everything you know is worthless, so that then we can teach you, and you can come out of it with what actually we want you to know. - Are there specific technical lessons you remember you learned from that? Sort of how to cut carrots, or how to approach food, how to prepare food,\nhow to think about food, how to carry yourself in the kitchen. You know?\n- All of those things. I think that of the most beautiful lessons was actually scrambled eggs. So, there's different layers of chefs. So they're all master chefs, they're all very well known\npeople and everything. But Alain Sailhac was one of the chief, like main, main guys. And he just passed away. A master chef. And everything kind of stopped when he would show up in the kitchen. And he would teach very few things. And all of the other\nchefs who would, you know, the same ones that were screaming at us, just like, it was like\nthe Red Sea parting. Like they have total\nrespect for this human, and he can do whatever he wants. And one of the things\nhe wanted to teach was, how do you make an\nomelet, a French omelet? And it's really\nfundamentally the same thing. It's a soft scrambled egg that you fold. And the love that he put\ninto the time with us, and of course he's a legend. There were moments like that\nwhere I'm like, \"Wow, okay.\" He also, just like the other chefs, didn't have any concern berating anyone. So he berated our master chefs. - [Lex] Nice. - Saying, \"I don't trust\nthese people to teach you how to make scrambled eggs. So I'm gonna do it instead.\" (Kimbal laughs) - I mean, can you speak to that? 'Cause you know, a lot\nof people hearing this would be like, \"Scrambled eggs? Like, why do you need to be a master chef to really make scrambled eggs?\" - Well, first of all, for me, and it's a learning journey forever. So, I make scrambled eggs. I mean, I must've made it\n10,000 times or more, whatever. - So it's like \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\", \"Kimbal Dreams of Scrambled Eggs\"? - Pretty much.\n- [Lex] Okay. - So I will wake up, and be held accountable by my\nkids to make scrambled eggs. This happens every morning. And... I know all the steps, muscle\nmemory level kind of steps. (Kimbal mumbles) And then I'll cook it, and it's very meditative for me, because you have to focus. So most scrambled eggs,\nsoft scrambled eggs recipes are 10, 15 minutes to get\nthem to that perfect softness. And the recipe that I\ngot from Chef Alain was, something that you can do in 90 seconds. But it requires total focus. Like if you like look up for a second, you're going to miss the perfect moment, when you have to stop and\nget those eggs outta the pan. (Lex chuckles) Because the eggs will keep cooking. And so it's this meditation. And sometimes, you hit it like perfectly. But most times, eh... It could've been a little softer, could've been a little firmer, could've been a little bit more salt, could've been a little bit more of pepper. And so, what's really\nfun about the morning is, my kids are kinda into it. So like, we critique the eggs. - [Lex] Yeah. - Every morning. - Do they have a rating system? Or back to the spreadsheet? - It's more like... And again, it also comes back\nto how do people feel, right? So my kids can be in a bad\nmood, and they can be grumpy. - Or it's like a Michelin\nstar system, like what- - No, no, it's more like, \"Oh, yeah, I like my eggs\na little more gooier.\" Or, \"Yesterday it was this way, but a little bit more\nsalt, a little less salt.\" Salt is usually the one that is... Because not all salts are equal. So if you are used to working\nwith a certain kind of salt, and then you just are\nforced, for some reason, you ran outta salt, so\nyou use some other salt, you actually don't know how to use it. You really want to have\nthe same salt all the time. - Yeah, you have a page\non salt in the book. - Yeah, totally.\n- Which was fascinating. - Salt is... You gotta get to know your salt, you gotta love your salt, and you gotta use it over\nand over and over again. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it will teach you\nhow to use that salt, where by, your own palette will tell you how salty you like things. But if you change it up, and you mix up a whole bunch of salt, you've now multiplied your learning path. So for me, I, my favorite\nsalt is Kosher salt. And I like to use that all the time. And if I ever change it, I might sprinkle a little\nbit of molten salt. Just crunchy, sort of a flaky salt. But it's more for that when\nyou're actually eating- - [Lex] For the texture. - It gives you texture\nas well as salt, exactly. You wouldn't use it on scrambled eggs. But if you switch out your\nsalts, it's a different weapon. - Yeah, yeah.\n(Kimbal laughs) You need to learn it. - I like how, you know, usually\nthere's wine connoisseurs. You're saying, going back\nto sort of farm-to-table, when you're talking about carrots in that same rigor and nuance, you have to consider the different farms involved for the carrots. In that same way, you have to\nconsider the different salts. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - With like- - And also not even all\nKosher salts are the same. It's the particular salt that\nyou like, get to know it. Get in a relationship with it. It's like, great. You will learn so much. - In terms of the\nmeasurement, the proportion, the amount of salt you put in, are you doing that like exactly? Or are you doing it by feel? - So, it's by feel, and that's where you get the relationship. So in fact, in the cookbook, I have QR codes that people can scan. Because what I struggle with recipes is, they don't teach you technique, right? They can describe the technique, but they don't teach the technique. 'cause it's a technique,\nit's not a recipe. And so one of the lessons\nis, how do you salt a steak? And the answer is not... \"Here's a teaspoon, and\nyou do it this way.\" The answer is use kosher salt, so you can see with your eyes, 'cause they're little flakes, how much salt is on your steak. And then cook it, and then taste it. You know? Do you think you need more\nor do you need it less? Okay, now next time, put a little more on it,\nbecause you can see it. And it's about learning the\nthe fact that you want to be able to see how much\nsalt is on the steak, so that you can then train\nyourself for the future of how much salt you want on your steak. - Yeah, but then the steak and the salt kind of dance together. It depends on where the steak came from. - That's true, that's true. Or the thickness of the steak. That'll make a difference. But for the most part,\nif you're able to see it, versus table salt, for\nexample, it just disappears. You just can't see what\nyou're putting on your steak. You can't really learn as a result. - I think you talk about roast chickens, where your love of food began. Well, what about steak? - Well, I mean, I love a good steak. It's so great. - So in the French school, you add sauces and all this kind of stuff, and in Boulder is when you realize like there's a beauty to the basic ingredient. - Simplicity, yeah. Like a good New York strip\nfrom a good rancher that... There's a lot of discussion, controversy, on how cattle should be raised. And we have a very different\napproach, which is, we know how our cattle are raised. We go to the farm. We get to know the rancher. And sometimes you do wanna\nhave them be finished on, like, they'll be grass-fed\nfor the most part, but then there's some sort of cool recipe of food you're giving them that will then make them taste better. And sometimes, it is actually pretty good to have a hundred percent grass-fed. I've had some amazing\nranchers that showed me that the flavors are all there. For the average person that, you know, might go to a Whole\nFoods or a grocery store, I think the simplicity of a good steak... It is important to get good sourcing, but also it's just good. - What's your favorite cut of meat? 'Cause New York strip... Probably New York strip for me. - Yeah, New York strip. Yeah. I like the fact that it's\nlean, but if you want the fat, you can dive into that\nlittle strip of fat, or you can leave it alone, 'cause you don't want it that night. And it's also a great\nsteak for adding something. Like if you wanna... You could either do like a pepper sauce, or you could do a lot of ground pepper, which gives it a peppery, not sauce, but it's a peppery steak. It's a really good steak for\nlike a canvas for other things. - But the basic ingredients\nyou're playing with is salt and pepper? - Yeah, pretty much. - [Lex] And then just the steak. - Actually, I will say\nthere's another one. Garlic. This is my favorite recipe for a steak is, you season it both sides, salt and pepper. You saute it in a little\nolive oil, barely anything, and you're getting a nice crisp, like a dark golden brown on both sides. The other trick with cooking\na steak is, don't touch it. You know, you just put one side. When you're ready to\nturn it, turn it around. Don't touch any other time. But at the end, you take a dab of butter, and you crush a clove of garlic. You don't even chop it,\nyou just crush the clove. And you put the two of them in the pan, and you just roll the steak\naround in the garlic butter. I think that's the way. - Bold move, Kimbal. (Kimbal laughs)\nBold move. Since you're in Austin quite a bit, opening a restaurant here, what do you think about barbecue? It's kind of the Texas way. - Well, I would say there's an Austin way. - [Lex] Definitely an Austin way. - And actually even Austin would say there's a suburb of Austin way, like- - [Lex] Yes. (Kimbal laughs) - I think that actually, the\nadventure of food is wonderful. I would absolutely say that Austin is one of the great food cities of America. And barbecue is one of its\ngifts that it gives the city. But you go to one and the other, and you'll have a different approach. And that's the part I love. Is where there's a real\ncelebration of the artisan. So you might go to one, and they have a style that they love, and they've been doing it for years. And then you'll go to another, and they have a style that they love and they've been doing it for years. And it's still barbecue, but\nthey're actually different. And it's really beautiful to see that. That's what food culture is. Like, it just builds up over time, by people who love this style of cooking. - Well, I especially love the communal, like how they structure\nrestaurants usually. Or... I don't even wanna call it a restaurant, 'cause it doesn't feel like a restaurant. It feels like a tavern or some sort. Like Terry Black's is like that. It's like- - [Kimbal] Yeah, they also\nhave like paper towels. - [Lex] Yeah. - Get as messy as you like. And it's a whole roll of paper towels. They don't just give you a napkin. They know what you're getting into. - Yeah. And there's just wood everywhere,\nand it kinda has this feel like this place has been around forever. It's not changing. I know it's the 21st\ncentury with the internet and all this kinda- - [Kimbal] Yeah. - \"Nonsense that you people are building, but really this is all about the same.\" - [Kimbal] Yes. - \"It's been the same for generations. We're doing it the same.\" That kinda feel. If you want to escape\nthe world in that way, and then truly connect with people. - One of the other things that'll happen in a town like Austin is, there'll be a barbecue joint\nthat is just legendary, right? And then out of that will come someone who wants to go do their\nown barbecue joint, and they'll take the learning\nfrom that barbecue joint. They'll open up a new one, but it won't be the same as\nthe other barbecue joint. Part of it's just like, \"Dude, like don't just do the same thing. Like do something... What do you have to say?\" - Mhm. - But also part of it is, if you're in the world of\nfood, like as an art form, and you want to go open up\nanother barbecue joint... You kinda wanna prove yourself. Like, I deserve to have a\nbarbecue joint in this town. I know this is one of the\nholy grails of barbecue. - [Lex] Yeah. - And people will follow you like they're following a musician, or they're following an artist. And they are excited to\nsee what your version is, and how well you can pull it off. It's like, it's actually, that's what I mean by like\na city with a food culture. Austin has that. - There's also like a\nlegend to certain places. Certain places are more than\njust the food they create. It's like... That could be a burden. You have to like, live up to the legendary\nnature of the name. - Our restaurant in Boulder,\nThe Kitchen, is 20 years old. We're very well known,\nwe're very well respected. And we do have to live up to the name. I think that our restaurant\nlives up to its name in not just the food, it's like you walk in and\nyou feel the restaurant. And that is also something\nwe've just done naturally. The space is 120 year old\nbuilding, used to be a brothel, then it was bookstore. Like, storied history. - [Lex] That's an interesting date. - No, literally. This was a mining town, right? So back in the 1800s, this was built late 1800s, that sort of brothels, that was a thing. And so there's an actual\ntunnel in the basement, that goes to the local hotel, that would be used for\ngoing back and forth between the hotel and the\nbrothel, without people knowing. And the tunnel is now concreted up. But you can go about 20,\n30 feet into the tunnel. (Kimbal laughs) But you go into the space, and it's actually an old space, so you feel like it's been there forever. - Yeah."

      "section": "Life-threatening accident",
      "text": "In 2010, you had a\nlife-threatening accident that changed the way\nyou see life, the world, also the way you see food and cooking. Can you tell me the story of it? - Yeah. So 2010, I was 37. I had opened the restaurant in 2004. And I had loved the\nrestaurant world, loved it. But I didn't really want to\ngrow a restaurant company. That wasn't my goal. And so I went back into technology, and I had gone from something that I love, to something that I like. For me it was like... It was like chewing sawdust every day. I just couldn't believe\nthat I had changed my life. and gone back into technology. And now I do do work in\ntechnology, and I do love it, but I found a better relationship with it. But I was really, really unhappy. From the outside, I was a\nsort of CEO of a hot startup. But from the inside, I\nwas just very unhappy. And I was in Jackson Hole, and I was doing these very\naggressive snowboard runs. And I'm, at the time, a pretty\ngood, aggressive snowboarder. And I remember saying to myself, \"Look, I've got kids. I\nneed to chill on this.\" The next day was Valentine's Day. Tomorrow's Valentine's Day, I'm just gonna have a\nnice day with the family, and my wife at the time. And we went to a children's run, you do the inner tube run. And the tubes are small, but\neveryone uses the same tube. So I'm 6'5\", and my\nkids are four years old, and everyone uses the same size tube. It should have been a message to me, not to get on this thing. But I went and got on it, and on the first run and I went down, and you're going super\nfast, 35 miles an hour, and the tube hit the breaking\nmats, and it stopped. The tube just stopped where\nit was, it just threw me. My head was facing downhill, so that created the\nwrong center of gravity. So instead of breaking, it just threw me. I landed on my head. My head went into my chest, like compression into my\nchest, like down like that. I ruptured my spine at C6 an C7. And in like the blink of\na second, I was paralyzed. I was like, \"What?\" You know, just like\nimpossible to comprehend. And they put this thing halo on my head, and they take me to the hospital, which was more of a medical clinic. And I'm just like, \"What's going on here?\" - Do you remember your thoughts\nfrom the moment it happened, to like when you got to the hospital? - I remember being... So this is one of the things that actually the doctor said caused the most damage, was I was thrown from the tube, and I heard this big\ncrunch sound in my body. And I knew that I was hurt. But I didn't feel any pain. That's also... Why wouldn't you feel pain? 'Cause you know, you're\nparalyzed, you don't feel pain. And I'm face down on the snow, and the snow is burning my face. 'Cause you know, you can't do that. You need something... And I found a way to turn myself around, so that my face wouldn't be on the ground. But I knew I couldn't move. And that they said actually\ncaused more damage than... Well, obviously the accident\ncreated the opening, but once you move your body, the blood goes into the spinal\ncolumn at a faster rate, and that is what caused my paralysis. But I remember that and... I remember getting into the ambulance... - [Lex] Did you think you were gonna die? Like in those seconds, minutes. - It was a different feeling of death. It was more... It was more of a, \"What is going on here?\" Like I can't make sense\nof what's going on. There was a moment when\nI got to the hospital, and they did this MRI, and the doctor comes up to me and says, \"Look, we've done this MRI.\" So now I'm in the\nhospital, and I can't move. But I also don't even feel any pain. So I'm like, it's very confusing. Your body looks like you can move it. Like, look, see how I'm moving my hand? Like it looks like you can do that, and then it just doesn't move. There's no feedback loop\nthat it's not moving. Your brain even thinks it's\nmoving, but it's not moving. It's like the worst, like\nmost terrifying thing. So the doctor says, \"The way you broke your neck was at a zero degree angle. That is so rare. But as a result, there is\nno twisting of the spine. We think that we can get the blood out of your spinal column, and you should get some or maybe\nall of your movement back.\" And I was like, \"Oh, okay. I think I'm gonna be fine. I guess I'm gonna be fine.\" And then I realized I had tears just streaming down the side of my face. And I was like, \"Whoa, man. I have no idea what's going on.\" - So this kind of intense\nstate of confusion. I wonder if it's a kinda weird psychological defense mechanism, of like taking you away from the obvious possibility of death. - Yeah, it was for sure, all of the defenses were up. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) I don't know how else to describe\nit, but there was denial. - [Lex] Yeah. - There was... There was this curiosity of like, \"Why is there no pain?\" Like when they did actually\nrepair me and fix me, it was three days later... The pain was indescribable,\nhow much pain I was in. But there was no pain for three days. (Kimbal laughs) - The human body is fascinating. - [Kimbal] Man! - Wow... So they were able- - Yeah, so they did this surgery, but I had this very clear voice in my head that I kind of determined that it's God. I'm not religious, but I don't know how else\nto describe the voice. And his voice was very clear. \"You're gonna work with kids and food.\" Okay, where did that come from? I'm like tech CEO. I have a restaurant. And we were working with\nsome kids in schools, with like helping a local nonprofit. And he's like, \"No, you're just gonna\nwork on kids and food.\" And my good friend Antonio and my brother were in the hospital, and I was like, \"I'm gonna\nwork on kids and food.\" You know, 'cause they're like, \"He's crazy. He's lost his mind.\" But not that they were arguing,\nno one was arguing with me, but I was like, \"I'm\njust going to do that. I need to say it out loud.\" And I remember resigning\nfrom my job as the CEO, from the hospital. And that was it. It was just clear. It was a clear voice. Wasn't for a moment, wasn't like a flash of light or anything. It was probably two weeks of clear voice. - [Lex] Of clarity. - Clarity. Exactly, clarity. And no monkey brain, nothing. No monkey brain, just clarity. - So you're not a religious person, but you do call it the voice of God. Who is that God do you think? Like, who is that? - [Kimbal] Yeah. - Where did that come from? - Well, I've done ayahuasca, and I've spoken to what\nthey call Mother Aya, which is another version of God. It's a divine presence. Which is maybe, I think\nis a better way to say it. I've also had this debate in my head, like, maybe it's just me. I'm talking to me. And it's my peaceful, more kinder, less caught up in the emotion\nof the day version of me. Maybe it's me. Okay, maybe it is, but it's there. - But who are you? Like how deep does it go? What does \"you\" mean? You could be, you know, first of all, like the depth of what\nthe human mind even is, is a gigantic mystery. Consciousness, all of it. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - Like who are you? Like yeah, maybe it is you, but then maybe in order to build you, we need to build the universe. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - Like you are actually, fundamentally a part of\nthis whole human society. So the pieces of humans\nthat you've interacted with are all within you. And then maybe the history of the humans that came before are also in there. And maybe the entirety of life\non earth is also in there. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - And the whatever brought\nlife about on earth is in there somewhere. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - So that's all you. - Which is really true. Evolution literally is\ntrue, that we all are... The photons from the sun came in and- - [Lex] You're part fish. - We all came from that. I think this one... You know, so one of the\nthings I do is meditate. I've been meditating for many, many years. And the way I meditate is, I sit and I listen to my thoughts, and I simply just do that\nfor 15 to 20 minutes. And it just calms the nervous\nsystem, and I breathe, and just breathe through, because it's been a stressful day. And it's just a beautiful way to... I kinda do it around, Remember I said I used to do a\nscotch at the bar after work, now I go meditate instead. A little less-\n- Same thing. - A little bit better for my health. But the meditation I was taught was... Sam Harris actually taught me this. Was not so much just about\nwatching your thoughts, but realizing that you're a watcher. You're actually a watcher. You're not just like, who\nis the person watching you? That's you, actually. Your thoughts are floating\nthrough your mind, but you are the watcher. And I was like, \"Oh,\nthat's really interesting. Okay, so I'm gonna learn. I'm gonna be the watcher.\" And what I learned was, I'm watching these thoughts go by, and there's a consistent other presence. And I'm like, \"What is that\nconsistent other presence?\" It's not a thought. It's not something I can\nkind of let it float away. And it doesn't even wanna float away. It's just a consistent other presence that I can watch and feel. - So you are the watcher watching\nthe feelings and thoughts, but there's also an other\npresence next to you almost. - Yes. Yeah. That's how I feel. And it's a beautiful presence. It's not a presence that\nis trying to intervene. It's not a presence that is\ntrying to tell you what to do. It's just a beautiful presence. - And that might be part\nof the thing you met when you took ayahuasca. - I learned about Mother Aya, where you have this\nexperience of talking to... Actually, I would say the closest\nthing to breaking my neck, that feeling was ayahuasca. - Can you go through that experience? 'Cause I'm actually traveling to the Amazon jungle in a month, and I'll probably do\nayahuasca for the first time. - [Kimbal] Okay. - So, I need a preview. Unofficial instruction manual. - Yeah, sure. So first of all, I think many different\nways to do it, right? And I've done many, many different ways. There's a very western medicine approach, where you have doctors that\nlook after you during the day, you know, put an eye mask\non, you're on a futon, and you really are in a\nwestern medicine setting. And it's frankly for me, has been the most powerful experience. I feel the most comfortable, 'cause I'm part of western\nmedicine in my upbringing. The other... Extreme, but they're kind of in between, would be very probably\na Peruvian ceremony, where you're probably gonna go, very much about you do it in a community, you do it with others, and you feel people go through their pain and their processing. So I know the whole gamut. But the thing that I found\nmost powerful about it, and profoundly powerful, I would say. First of all, it's non-recreational. So no one should do this for a good time. This is not a good time. This is a very- - Almost traumatic? But in again, a beautiful way. - I was actually gonna say\nthat word, but it's not. It's not traumatic, it's profound. So it's more like you don't have... You really leave who\nyou were before behind, and then you become the\nperson you will be afterwards. (Kimbal laughs) - And that's never an easy thing. - Yes, exactly. And sometimes, what I recall was arguing with Mother Aya and saying, \"No, I'm fine. Like, what are you talking about? Like, leave me alone.\" (Kimbal laughs) And yeah, that- - How did that work out? (Lex and Kimbal laughing)"

      "text": "But before 2010, the accident, and the two transformational\nexperiences you had, you were a very successful tech CEO. Maybe go back to the early days with Zip2. In 1994, you and Elon started Zip2. Tell me the story of that. - Yeah, so in '94 we actually\ndid a road trip around the US to brainstorm about what we\nwanted to do after college. - What was that road trip like? Was it- - That was awesome. So we went from Silicon\nValley to Philadelphia. - [Lex] Nice. - In my brother's old, like a really cool, you know, it's one of those very old BMWs, not ones from the 60s or 70s. But the car didn't work. It would break down all the time. But we had a blast. You know, we just... I remember going through Needles... On the border of California-Arizona, there's a town called Needles. It's the hottest place in America. And the engine was not cooling, so we had to put the heat on. So we had the heat blasting\nto cool the engine, keep the engine cool, and\nwe keep the windows down, because we can't stand\nthe heat in the car. But actually the outside heat is hotter than the inside heat. So you're just in a furnace\nas you're driving through. - [Lex] Just sweating. - It was at night, even. I can't imagine doing that- - [Lex] Oh, wow.\n- In the day. But yeah, it was wonderful. It took us a few weeks, I\nthink three weeks maybe. - First time across America? - First like a road trip like that. Yeah, for sure. But it was really not a\nroad trip for tourist sites. We went to the weirdest places. And actually I would\nsay we didn't go to 'em, we broke down in the weirdest places. - [Lex] Yeah. (Lex laughs) - Because that's when we stopped. - Did you meet any interesting people? - I remember we broke down in\nthe Badlands of South Dakota, about an hour from Rapid City. And that road is empty. And so we actually slept in the car, because there was just no one around. There's no cell phones in those days. And eventually a trucker picked us up. He was just like, \"Man, you guys are the\ndumbest kids on the planet.\" I was like 21, he was maybe 22. But he was so nice to\nus, and so kind to us, and found us a mechanic in Rapid City, and then found us a tow truck. And yeah, you find the\nmost wonderful people... When you're in a place of distress, people do wanna take care of other people. - They help you. - [Kimbal] Yeah, they wanna help. - And especially when\nyou're on a road trip... 'Cause I've taken a road trip\nacross the United States, and there's a part of people where they... They really love that. I think part of them\nwants to do that also. Wants to kind of escape whatever\nthe local, the struggles, just whatever the mundaneness,\nthe struggle of life are, a road trip is a kind of\nthing where you're like, \"You know what? I'm going to get away from it all, and I'm going to experience\nlife in the full, the epic sort of Jack Kerouac\nway of seeing America.\" The people, not the tourist\nsites, just the human-ness. - Yeah, exactly. This was not tourist related. We did, of course, one we stopped at Mount Rushmore at night, which you can see nothing. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - We thought that was hilarious. We couldn't see Mount Rushmore. - [Lex] That's great. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) - It was like, well, we\nphysically were here. We took a photo of us- - In the darkness. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) You can just say you went\nto the Grand Canyon too, just at night. - [Kimbal] Right. - And just visit different\nplaces when the car broke down. I love it. So yes, you took the road\ntrip before founding Zip2. - Yeah, so I had a experience in college running a house painting business. That for me was my first\nexperience with success. It was very, very hard. It was a franchise where\nthey teach students how to paint houses. But I was good at it. You know, I built a team of 30\npeople after about two years, and so I had a taste of, \"Hey, I'm not, I'm not unable to do this.\" In fact, my most vulnerable place I remember as an entrepreneur, was I just loved the idea\nof Wall Street and finance. I was kind of allured by it. This is in late 80s, I'm in high school, and there was a lot of these books, \"Liar's Poker\", and others that came out. And I was like, \"Ah, man, this is awesome. These people must be amazing.\" So I went to business school, and I busted my ass to get\nlike a kick-ass summer job. And I got a job in one of the main banks, and it was in Toronto, but it was like the original Wall Street. And I was so disappointed with the people that I was around. I was just like, \"Whoa.\" I totally misunderstood\nwhat the banking world is. It was a very large bank. I'm sure if I'd gone to\na more aggressive one, maybe I would've had a better experience. When I say aggressive, meaning\nsomeone was paying attention. Like this was just a... People kind of showing up\nand not doing much, you know? And anyway, actually, it was funny. So, this is great. So, 1991-'92, one of those summers. But the summer job was, literally, they print out the sales\nfor all brokerage houses, for the whole company. Pile of papers that's maybe\nfour or five feet tall. And you have a pencil, and you add things up using\nyour pencil and a calculator. And I had known about Lotus 1-2-3 forever. Excel was coming out, and I was like... \"Hey guys, you know that there's a different way to do this.\" (Lex and Kimbal laughing) And they're like, \"Don't\ntalk to us, just do your job. Go do it.\" - [Lex] Just use the pencil. - So I went to the head of the data, I just asked because,\nbecause in those days, you had the manila envelope, where you just write\nthe name of the person that you want this to go\nto, and it'll go to them. It's like email, I guess,\nbut there's no filter. - There's no spam filter. - There's no spam filter. So I sent a note, I wrote a nice letter to the database administrator,\nwho I didn't really know. And I said, \"Would you\nbe open to me saying hi, and maybe I can get access to the file, rather than print the thing\nout and use a pencil?\" And she responded right\naway, and we hit it off. I mean, she was great. And so she's like, \"Of\ncourse you can have it.\" I can't believe these guys\nare doing what they're doing. So, for the first couple\nof weeks of the summer, I wrote code in Lotus 1-2-3 that would... This is gonna sound crazy, but you type in the date range, you type in the geography, and you type in which part\nof the bank you care about, And it will literally just\ncreate a new spreadsheet, and the macro would print it out. It was like a magic trick for these guys. And... (Kimbal laughs) - Incredible. - I know, I know. It's sounding that... I mean, for me, I'm like,\n\"Guys, this is so obvious.\" (Lex and Kimbal laughing) So I got all that done, and this job was supposed to\ntake three or four months, because you're doing this with a pencil. And now I'd created this macro that you could not just do it, you could tweak it and say, oh, I want this area of\nthe world, or this month, or that month compared\nto that month, you know, all the normal things you\ncould do with a spreadsheet. And the software was on a floppy disk. And I was like, \"Here's the software, and just put it into your computer. Right, now open 1-2-3.\" And it just pops up with a little box, so type in your dates and you know, I coded a little thing like that. And... What I was astounded by was, not so much that they\nthought it was a magic trick, it was the lack of\nappreciation for innovation. They just looked at it and they were like, \"Huh, that's nice.\" And I was like, we're\ngonna have someone spend hundreds of hours doing something, and now it's something\nyou can do in a minute. - Yeah, if that doesn't\nfill you with excitement- - Yeah, like, if that\ndoesn't move your needle, what the heck? And so I was really disappointed\nwith the banking world. Anyway, but that was also fun- - Such a good example though. Yeah. And then also see the possibility of where that goes, you know? - But then I got back to business school, and I canceled all of my business\nclasses I possibly could. But I was actually in business school, so I couldn't cancel 'em all. All the finance courses, I was like, I'm done with that industry,\nI'm not going back. SO the vulnerable part for me was, my whole family's full of entrepreneurs, and there was this franchise\nto do house painting. And I genuinely was afraid\nthat I wouldn't be good at it. And I was like, \"Wow, I\nreally am afraid of failure.\" It's very easy to avoid entrepreneurship, but if your whole family's entrepreneurs, and you go in and you aren't good... I was really afraid. - You're gonna have to face that failure every time you meet your family. - Yes.\n(Lex laughs) Our family are wonderful and everything, but pretty much everyone's\nan entrepreneur. And of course, not everyone's perfect, not everyone's, you know, doing it successfully all the time. But when you're young, and\nyou wanna prove yourself, it really was putting\nmy heart on my sleeve. I started the business\nin this part of Toronto, and for the first... So you paint the houses in the summer, but you do all your sales\npre before the summer. You know, all the way till April, I was just not succeeding. And I was like, \"Oh my God, I'm just gonna fail.\" And I remember that, I was like... My whole nervous system\nwas like, \"I'm a failure.\" And I remember I had\nthis general manager who, you know, he was like, \"Kimbal, you seem like you\nknow what you're doing. Why are you not making any sales?\" And so he actually went with\nme on a few sales calls, and I was like... And he was like, \"Oh...\" He was great. \"You're doing this wrong,\nyou're doing that wrong, you're doing this wrong. And change those three things.\" And it was like a watershed moment. Just like all of a sudden... And I just followed the instructions of what this guy taught me. All of a sudden, every\nsingle sale I would make, I was like... I can't believe that I... It was really my lack of humility to learn from someone else. I was like, \"No, I'm gonna\nprove that I can do this without your teachings.\" And I was gonna fail. - So to you, that humility is essential for the entrepreneur, especially young. - I would say if we have\nan openness to learning, which does require humility. You help get other people\nto help you course correct. But it does start with humility. Because if you try and pretend\nyou have all the answers, you don't."

That was an interesting\ntime in the history of tech. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - But I mean, what was it like you, you mentioned the first\npeople to look at a map, basically at directions. - Yeah, so, mapping had\nbeen on the internet, but vector-based mapping had not. So that's the ability\nto zoom in or zoom out. And it's really data versus\nan image that it comes across. And we went into this\ncompany called Navteq, my brother and I, and we\njust asked for the data. This is Silicon Valley. They wrote us a one page letter that we had to sign and said, \"Here's all of our data that\nwe own it, you don't own it, but you can use it on the internet, and if you ever make any money\non it, you have to call us.\" - [Lex] Mhm. (Lex laughs)\n- That was it. - [Lex] Yeah. - And we're like, \"Okay,\nthat sounds great.\" And so we put it up on the internet, and back in those days, it\nmight take 60 to 120 seconds to actually give you an answer back. But it was amazing. The door to door directions, the ability to take a map\nand zoom in and zoom out. We use these things 10 times a day now. It was amazing. And we were the first two humans\nto see it on the internet. Like, this stuff didn't\neven exist to the world. Like the Navteq was building\nit for Hertz NeverLost, which would come out a few years later. This was not something\nthat people knew existed. This was something we\ndiscovered that it existed. And we're like, \"Well,\nlet's put it on the internet and share it with the world.\" - What did the two of you feel like? Like, to see that magic? Did you know- - It was amazing. (Kimbal and Lex laughing) It was like, \"What?\" (Kimbal laughs) - Like, I mean, the amazing,\njust that it's cool, but also that you could see the future that this could transform... - I don't think people understand, before this moment, you could\nnot be told your directions. - [Le] Yeah. - You just could not. Like today, we live in this world where we're told our\ndirections all the time. Before this moment, you could\nnot be told your directions. - [Lex] Yeah. - And all of a sudden, you could. - [Lex] Yeah. - It wasn't like a little thing. - Yeah, there's a bunch of things that, once we have, we take it for granted. And that takes like a day for\npeople to like transition. - [Kimbal] Totally, one- - It like boom. \"Oh, okay, cool.\" - Yeah, exactly. Exactly. - And when you see, maybe when you're one of the\nfirst humans to see that thing, you're like, \"Holy shit.\" - \"Holy shit, this is going\nto be used by everyone, all the time, forever.\" - So, Zip2 was a success. - I would say it was a success, but it was also a very\nhard company to build. And I mean it because, the internet in those\ndays was a boom time. We were being funded, but\nyou couldn't make any money. And so it was actually really hard. The constant outside criticism\nthat we aren't for real, this is not gonna survive,\nthis is not gonna... And it started to feel that way. We're like, \"Wow, man, this is...\" We are doing something that is\ngreat that people are using. And we were a top 100 website. Most of our work was through\nfolks like the New York Times, so we were even much busier than that. But there was just no money in it. Even today, go to Google\nMaps, there's no money in it. It's just local search that\nis needed for everyone, and it became an add-on to search. But even remember in those days, you couldn't make money at search either. - [Lex] Mhm. - No one had figured\nout AdWords or anything. They didn't realize how\nbig of a business this was. But we all knew this was a thing, and everyone was using it. - But didn't quite know how\nto make money out of it. - Couldn't make money. When we got acquired, it\nwas a bittersweet moment, because Compact had owned AltaVista, wanted to merge that\nsort of regular search, which was the best search\nengine at the time, pre-Google, with Zip2, which would\nbe the best local search, and it would be a Yahoo killer. And Compact just wanted to make money by taking the company public, but they wouldn't give us any stock. They paid us cash, which turned out actually\nvery well for us, because the whole internet bubble burst. We didn't know that at the time. And so it was bittersweet, because they essentially\nwanted our company, and we were welcome to\nstay, but you don't have to. - [Lex] Right. - And that feeling... That was a pretty rough feeling. Yeah. - But in retrospect,\nit opened the door to- - It set us up for an incredible platform to go do beautiful things."

      "text": "- You've invested in X.com, that eventually merged with PayPal. That's a fascinating story there. Also fascinating on many levels, including the fact the\ncurrent social media company, formerly known as\nTwitter, is now called X. History has like a rhyme to it. Like it's kind of all hilarious\nin a certain kind of way. You invested in, and helped sell a lot of the initial products for Tesla. (Lex laughs) - Yeah, I still sit on the board of Tesla. Tesla is 20 years now. Isn't that amazing?\n- [Lex] 20 years. - Yeah. - From the Roadster,\nthe initial Roadster to- - I still have the first business plan. So I didn't join as a founder, I joined as a founding board member. And so I didn't write the\nbusiness plan, I got to read it. And I still have that, I still\nhave it as a part of history. - Did you see the future at that time? Like the company that Tesla is today, could you and Elon imagine it? - No, no. I certainly didn't. What I saw, and it was a real... For me personally, I was really upset that General Motors had\nkilled their EV car. There's even a movie called\n\"Who Killed the Electric Car?\" And I knew that the physics\nof electric is perfectly fine. I mean, there's no reason why you couldn't use a electric\ncar to drive around. What resonated with me\nwith the business plan was, take an electric motor, which is really a high performance motor, and put it in a sports car, and sell it at a high price as a way to enter into the market. Whereas what others had been doing, what at least General Motors had done is, you put it into a really crummy car, and you sell it as a commuter vehicle that doesn't really work that well. And looks ugly as well. Like they really did everything they could to make that thing as ugly as sin. And then I was like, \"Okay, I get it.\" We're gonna take an\nappropriate technology, and put it in an appropriate car, because electric motors,\nthey have constant torque, incredible power... Put it in a car that\nlooks like a sports car. You know, so the idea was to\nput it in the Lotus Elise, redesign it a bit. And even at that point, I was like, this is theoretically good,\nso I'm join and help build it, but I was not convinced\nthat it would work. Because General Motors had\ndone such a terrible job of making everyone think that\nthese things are terrible. But I was curious. And the time that I fell\nin love with the company and its mission was, I was driving in what's called a mule, where we take a car, and\nwe take the engine out, and we put put in electric drivetrain. And I drove it, you know, even the dashboards, there's no dashboard. It's just like you got a steering wheel, and it's just like wires\nand everything around. And I remember, there's a street\nwe were on in the Bay Area called Bing Street. And I was just like... No traffic. I was like, \"I'm just gonna\ndrive this, I'm gonna floor it. See what happens. And it was a feeling I'd\nnever experienced before. Gasoline cars have an inertia to them. So you... (Kimbal hums)\n- [Lex] Yeah. - This is just, was like\nbeing shot out of a cannon. And okay, this is gonna be real. - It's very spaceship like feeling. - Yeah. It's like, whoa. It's like G-force pulls you back. - [Lex] Yeah. - So I was like, \"Okay,\nthis is gonna be great. We're gonna create\nsomething interesting here.\" I think the real\ntransformative thing for Tesla was the Model 3. When we were able to get the\nprice down for the world. - And that was also one\nof the most challenging... - [Kimbal] Oh my God. - Periods of Tesla for you. - And do or die. I mean, we were borderline bankrupt like two or three times that year. I mean, and everyone was hating on us about whether we'd get that done. The Model 3 today is\nincredibly affordable car. Like a 300 bucks a month kind\nof lease, and $3,000 down. That's where you get the scale. That's where you get people who... And by the way, it's a great car. It's even a better Model 3 now\nthan it was five years ago. We don't function the way car\ncompanies function, right? We function more like how\nan iPhone company works, how Apple works. So our Model 3 today, this\nyear, is better than last year. It's like way better. And we just keep getting better. - And the software is a\nfundamental part of the car, and the software keeps improving. - Exactly. And we can upload over-the-air. - Which was one of the things that people don't often acknowledge. It's the over-the-air updates. It's like a revolutionary thing. - [Kimbal] Yes. - It's not just the autopilot. To me it's like the over-the-air updates is an even bigger thing than an autopilot, at least in this like moment of history. Because you basically turned\na car into the iPhone. - Exactly. It's an iPhone with wheels. But actually, talking about autopilot, like right after this interview, I'm gonna go test out the latest Model 3. - You're gonna get driven\naround by the robot. - I'm gonna get driven around by the car. I'm gonna say, \"I wanna\ngo to this barbecue joint. Take me there and park me there.\" And I'm gonna see how it is. And this is the latest Model 3 that we have out into production. Anyone can buy it. And it's super affordable. And it's like, okay... Full self-driving is a journey, right? It's not like there's a destination. It's a journey forever. So let's see where we\nare on the journey today. - And there's been a\nbit of a push and pull between you and Elon in\nterms of levels of optimism about deadlines and so on, timelines about when we'll\narrive at the destination. I like that you said it's a journey. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - For Elon there's a destination. - [Kimbal] Right, exactly. - And that destination is tomorrow. - [Kimbal] Yeah, right. (laughs) - Or yesterday. - That's a really good insight. I actually live with this\nconcept of a growth mindset versus a fixed mindset. And it's a, I don't know,\na philosophical term where, fixed mindset is about the destination, and a growth mindset is about\nlearning on the journey. And I think that I'm a happier person because I take that learning\non the journey approach. Whereas it's really frustrating if it has to be about the\ndestination every time. - The nice thing about destination, at least from my personal perspective as like a programmer, engineer is like, it puts a little fire\nunder you to get shit done. Like if there's a clear\ndeadline of a destination, you feel the anxiety of- - I would say that I still do that, but I call those forcing functions instead of destinations. - [Lex] Sure. - Because you're just forcing people to crank on on some code\nor cookbook or whatever, because you have a date. And oftentimes there's a reason, I mean, it's the 20th anniversary, you wanted to get the cookbook out. We have a reason, we didn't\nmake this up outta thin air. And so, yeah, that does push you. But just because we have the cookbook doesn't mean it's a destination. It means it was a forcing\nfunction to get it out there, now we're on the journey."

There's a book about that\njourney, that is incredible. - It's an interesting moment\nin the history of humanity, that perhaps hopefully will\nbecome a multiplanetary species. But SpaceX is also a company. You invested in SpaceX, you\nwere side by side with Elon through the highs and the lows, through the lows and the highs. So, what were some memorable challenges? What were some low points? - [Kimbal] Sure. - From the history of SpaceX? - One of the hardest\ntimes in SpaceX was... We were in the mid Pacific in Kwajalein, and my brother had had sold PayPal. He'd done well financially,\nbut in the rocket world, that money goes away really quickly. And we were in this\nmilitary base in Kwajalein, and I think it was the\nsecond rocket that blew up, I'm not sure. But we didn't have infinite resources. I certainly didn't have the resources. I mean, I'm there to\nsupport, brotherly support. So every rocket launch was do or die. And the first one had blown up. And so the second one... I think it was the second one, blew up, and it was so depressing. It was just like, \"Ugh.\" There's nowhere to go,\nthere's no distraction. You're on this military base,\nyou don't really socialize. So it's just, we were all together, and I had gotten to know... You know, for me, I'm not\npart of the team, right? I'm just there for emotional\nsupport or whatever, 'cause it's cool. And so I got to know a\ncouple of people locally, and got to know this one\nguy who had a mobile home. Best view in the world,\nbut it's just a mobile home with a good patch of grass next to it. And I was just desperate to find food that wasn't from the cafeteria. 'Cause this is the worst\nfood you can imagine. - [Lex] Yeah. - And so I met him, and he showed me this tiny, little grocery store\nwhich had a few things like canned tomatoes and... Again, you're in the middle\nof nowhere, so nothing fresh. And I made this dish that\nwas kind of a version of a... Like an Italian version\nof chili, you know? Just baked beans, and sweating\nonions, and then tomatoes. And it was a big pot of food,\n'cause it's a group of people. We didn't even have a table. And we just put the big pot in the middle, and we had our little paper plates, and we took a scoop as we needed it. And it was... The gathering place of like, food brings people together\nin the most difficult times. And it was one of my favorite memories, because I was able to bring my gift to this group of incredible people, that their hearts were broken, you know? And to sit there and share a meal, and feel the life kind\nof come back into us. And by the end of the night, we're actually having a good time. - What a fascinating contrast of rockets, kind of representing\nthe peak accomplishment of human beings as a society, and then returning to the thing that is the foundation of human society, which is that communal experience. - A communal, vulnerable connection. Like we mentioned vulnerability earlier. The most vulnerable place, actually, that's when you have some of\nyour most beautiful meals. - Yeah. The descendants of apes gathering\naround some baked beans. - (laughs) Right. - After watching a rocket explode. - [Kimbal] Yeah."

      "text": "- What gives you hope about the future of this whole thing we've got going on? Humanity. - If you look at how things have changed over the past, say, 50 years, you can clearly say, \"Oh, wow.\" Poverty rates have gone down, infant mortality's gone down dramatically. All these things have gone down a lot. So if you look at it on a daily basis, you can tell that life is very dramatic. You know, whether it's\nsomething's blowing up on X, or from the newspapers or whatever. And you can really get caught up into it. But if you look back over\nthe past few decades, things are getting better. And I mean at the fundamental level, like are less people hungry? I mean, there is war going on, of course, but are there less wars? Yes. And so I think if we all just\nstep back a little bit... It's less about hope, it's more of perspective and reflection. And if I do see a problem, like in case of the obesity epidemic, I work really hard to help with that. Our nonprofit's called Big Green, and we work with 150\nnonprofits around the country to help Americans grow food again, get connected to their food. 'Cause I really believe\ngrowing food changes your life. And so okay, let's go do that. So I'll help out where I think we really can make a difference, but if you step back a little, things are actually getting better. It's just a bumpy ride. (Lex laughs) - Yeah, and for those of\nus watching all of this, I think I would love to see\nmore celebrating of the people that are helping. The people that have found\ntheir way of helping, and just celebrating those people. - Yeah. Well, I would also... Actually, that's a really nice point. I have learned that you really wanna celebrate your successes. Because even in the\ngreater scheme of things, I've learned this in the startup world, where you're constantly facing death. You know, like just why\nshould you even exist? Do your customers want your product? Or whatever. And then something will\nhappen where you're like, \"Wow, we really nailed that. That's really great.\" Or you got a product released, or got some good kudos from something. \"All right, everyone,\nwe're gonna go celebrate.\" And actually everyone's still like, \"No, no, we've got all\nthese other problems.\" \"Nope, we're gonna go celebrate, and then we'll go back to the problems.\" 'Cause if you don't do that, then it just starts\nbuilding on this kind of... You never really get to celebrate. - Mhm. And be grateful. Well, I think this is a\ngood time to go celebrate the very fact that we're alive today. We get to live and enjoy\nthis incredible life, the two of us, and have\nthis great conversation. And we'll get to celebrate\nover some scrambled eggs. - Beautiful. - [Lex] I'm gonna hold you to it. - Beautiful. - Kimbal, thank you so\nmuch for talking today. - Thank you for having me. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Kimbal Musk.

  "full_text": "- For me, cooking is an art. - What's your favorite\ningredient to cook with? - There isn't one. It's more like... When there is one, it really is one. You know? Like there's peaches on\nthe cover of this cookbook. Those peaches, those were in August. Colorado peaches. It just doesn't get any better than that. - On that day, at that\nmoment, that was the best. - That was the best. But that only lasts for a week. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then they don't taste so great. - Yeah. (Lex chuckles)\n(Kimbal laughs) But damn are they so good in that moment, and you just can't stop\nwanting to use that ingredient. - The following is a\nconversation with Kimbal Musk. A long time entrepreneur and chef, and author of a new cookbook, called \"The Kitchen Cookbook:\nCooking for Your Community.\" You should check it out. It is in fact, the first\ncookbook I've ever owned. I've already made stuff\nfrom it, and it's delicious. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Kimbal Musk. Growing up in South Africa, you\nsaid it was a violent place. What are some formative moments that you remember from that time? - South Africa was... So, I grew up in apartheid South Africa, but more specifically\nthe fall of apartheid. So I was a teenager in the '80s. And our community would... Part of our social life, frankly, was the anti-apartheid protests, and to go be with white\npeople, Black people, kind of mixing it all altogether. The most formative experiences, frankly, how much I appreciate\na place like America, where we have value for human life. So that was a country where\nhuman life was not valued. It was a weird thing to\ncome from that to here, where we take it so seriously if someone dies in a war\nor something like that. And we just didn't take it\nseriously in South Africa. People died, or people were killed. I saw someone killed in front of me. I was getting off a train, and it's a very violent\ntrain, known for violence. We were stupid kids. We didn't really listen to our parents. We went on this train,\nand the doors opened, and I had people trying\nto get off the train. And in front of me, two Black people. One Black guy just stabbed this knife in the side of this\nother Black guy's head. And you're like, \"What the fuck?\" And you just... I gotta get off the train. - How old were you at this time? - Probably 16 or 17. And I gotta get off the train. And everyone is trying\nto get me to get off, because, you know, they're all behind me. So I step off, and I step\ninto the pool of blood, one foot, and then I just\nwalk for about 100 paces while the stickiness of\nthe blood just kind of, from my sneakers, just on one foot, just like leaves a footprint behind me. And you just walk on. You just walk on. - [Lex] Did the others walk on as well? - Everyone walked on. - That's an interesting point you make. Underlying the violence is a kind of... Philosophy that human life is disposable, the individual life is disposable. I mean, that underlies many ideologies. You know, I grew up in the Soviet Union. The value of human life was lower there than in the United States. The value of the individual in the United States is really high. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - There's probably an index\nyou can put together, like- - [Kimbal] Yeah, right, exactly. - Per nation. That's a really interesting way to put it, because violence is much\neasier on a mass scale. Suffering, causing\nsuffering on a mass scale is much easier when you\ndon't value the human life. - I've heard this before, where,\nwhich I think I agree with, is when someone is killed,\nsomeone's taken from our lives, the vacuum that it creates, the social vacuum is\nextraordinarily painful. And it truly is true. I mean, if someone in my\ncommunity passes away, it'd be very, very sad for me. And when you go to a place where... Live, grow up in a place\nwhere that human life is not valued, there's something about the... There's a little bit less of\nthe social vacuum created, because everyone is kind of expecting everyone to potentially be\ntaken out at any moment. But then there's also a\nbeauty to it because... There's a much more of\na celebratory element. My cousin Russ and I,\nagain, we're stupid kids, we shouldn't be doing this. But we'd go into the townships, where a lot of the violence\nwould be happening. And we really didn't see\nmost of the violence there. It was in these more\nprotests and so forth. But there's a joy that also comes from lower value of human life. There's a real joy. Like everyone was like, \"Well...\" I mean, it's beautiful. We'd have dinner with\nBlack friends, you know? Friends with their family, and\nwe were still pretty young. And there was just a real joy to it. - When you accept mortality- - [Kimbal] Yeah. (laughs) - You can really enjoy life. - You can really enjoy life. I mean, I think that's\nactually quite a nice insight. I've never really put it that way, but I think that's right actually. I think you just chill out a bit, take things a little less seriously. - \"Cause life does end for everybody. - It does, right? (laughs) - And if you just head\non accept that fact. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - You can just enjoy every single moment, and let go of this attachment,\nand just enjoy the moment. - I think there's a real... I do love that we all\nlive longer and so forth, but we should live longer\nwith the goal of joy. - [Lex] Mhm. - The goal of happiness and peace. Not... Some form of misery that you\nchoose to attach yourself to. - Maximize joy. - Maximize joy, that's right. - There's a story that Walter\nIsaacson writes about where Elon got beat up pretty\nbad, and you were there, and then you also had to watch your dad yell at Elan for an hour, calling him worthless,\nall those kinds of things. You said it was the worst\nmemory of your life. What do you make of such cruelty? What do you remember from that time? - I mean, it was horrible. I think, you know,\ncoming back to the point of low value of human life... They tried to kill him. There was no holding back,\nso I just watched someone... It wasn't just one, but\nthere was a main person, and then there was a few\nothers that piled in. They just... They tried to kill him, in front of me. We were eating sandwiches on\na staircase at the school, in the outdoor staircase and... I just had to... They were not coming after me, and then I just had to\nwatch, and I couldn't help. It was one of the saddest,\nmost difficult experiences. It was just awful. - Just like that, life can end. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - It could've been you. - Yeah, I think... So I've had a near death\nexperience where I almost died. It was in 2010. And I think that... And I broke my neck, and I can go into that story in a moment. But this was different. This was... This comes back to the low\nvalue of human life part, where if someone had killed my brother, if that person had beat him to death, which he was trying to do, life would've gone on. You know, that's like an insane\nthought in an American... Well, maybe in some tough neighborhoods, but for the most part, it's not a thing. - Yeah, the brutality of that. The mundaneness of the brutality. - Yeah. - It makes you think of\nall the places in the world that that's happening. - [Kimbal] Exactly, exactly. - And all the beautiful\npeople that just disappear. - I always say to people who\nhave an opinion about America that, you know, this is a\nreally bad country or whatever. And I say, \"Look, please\ngo try another country before you say that.\" Not to say that America can't get better. But please go try another country. Because not having that perspective, or having a perspective that... I don't know, like a\nchip on their shoulder about the country that they're in... Okay, go try another country, and then come back and tell me. And pick any country. It doesn't have to be\nsome very violent country. You could pick any country. And you just realize that actually, the world doesn't think the\nsame way that America thinks. And you're gonna just learn\na perspective that, I think, gives you a better way to\ncritique where we live in America. - Yeah, it's humbling. You said that your dad was a\nrollercoaster of affection, and then verbal abuse. Walter Isaacson quotes\nBarack Obama who said, \"Someone once said that every\nman is trying to live up to his father's expectations or make up for his father's mistakes, and I suppose that may\nexplain my particular malady.\" Does part of that ring true for you? - What I thought you were gonna say was... I thought you were gonna\nend the sentence with, \"Live up to my father's expectations.\" That's what most people say. But then you said the second part, which is make up for his mistakes. And I think that's actually... That one rings true for me. He was really... He's still alive, but\nI'm not connected to him. But he's very... He taught me, the phrase I used to have, was he taught me what not to do. So I still actually learned a lot. What kind of human not to be, what kind of actions not to take. And so that kind of, closer\nto living up to his mistakes, but my father's such a train wreck that it's not really mistakes. It's like, intentional\nactions of what not to do. \"Okay, look, don't do that.\" - But there's still the\ntrauma of that, you know, it has an effect on the human psychology, and can permeate through time. So it has probably\ncomplex indirect effects on who you are. The good and the bad. - There's a critique\nthat my friends give me, which is when they're talking to me, I kind of just drift away. I'm still looking at them. I'm still nodding. Might even respond to them\nin their conversation. But I'm actually not there. And I've realized that\nI actually, I grew up, 'cause my father would just... Verbal abuse is one way to say it. It is abuse, but it's more just\nverbal diarrhea, for hours. And constantly saying,\n\"Do you understand?\" Like, he wants to make sure\nthat I'm paying attention. So I train myself to look\nlike I'm paying attention, but I'm not. - To disappear to some place. - Disappear to some place. - [Lex] Wherever that is. - Yeah. And I do that less and\nless over time, but I- - But that path has been\npaved somewhere in your mind at childhood, so... It could be easy to walk down it. You and Elon were close growing up. You're still close. What did you learn from each other? How did you compliment each other? - Yeah, I think we're a good compliment. I'll talk for myself first. My strength is definitely\non the social side. I love the gathering place. And I love putting people\ntogether in person. And I love to have vibrant\ndebates and conversations. I've been doing that forever, including fun parties and stuff, where I bring people together, and I really kind of\nwant people to have fun, but be vulnerable, not\njust like silly partying, but actually like, let's all connect. The definition for me of a good party is people laugh and cry. Like, I wanna have people\nhave an emotional connection. I go to Burning Man every year, and there's no question you will cry at some point during Burning Man. - No small talk. - No small talk. Yeah, exactly. No small talk. - [Lex] Yeah. - You're totally right.\nUnlike most parties... Not parties, but most events\nyou go to are like clubs, these sort of nightclubs. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I never go to those. And my joke is... Why would I wanna go to a place where I pay to shout\nsmall talk in the dark? (Lex and Kimbal laughing) - That's a good line. That's what it feels like. The only the reason I enjoy those places is the full absurdity of exactly that. (Kimbal laughs) - Right. It's totally absurd. - What are we doing? What is this? What is this like? (Lex chuckles) - So, my compliment for my brother, was just bringing joy\nand social connection. And he's truly... He's an engineering genius. I've worked with him forever. And we do compliment each other. - You just came out with\na cookbook, by the way. Thank you for giving me my first cookbook. I feel legit. - [Kimbal] I love that\nit's your first cookbook. - I'm gonna keep it... (Kimbal laughs) I'm gonna keep it on the counter, and it's gonna give me legitimacy\nwhen anyone comes over. Hey, listen, I'm basically a chef now. - [Kimbal] That's right. (Lex chuckles)\nExactly. - When did you first fall\nin love with cooking? - I started cooking\nwhen I was 11 years old. My mom is just, she's wonderful, but she's self-admittedly a bad cook. But at the time, I think anyone with kids\nthat goes through this. Your kids just want like something that, like spaghetti bolognese\nor a burger or something. And my mom would do brown bread, plain yogurt and boiled squash. You know, like the absolute\nmost disgusting things that a child could imagine eating. And so I said, \"Can I cook?\" And she said, \"Yeah, if you\nwanna cook, no problem.\" So I went to the grocery store... And back in those days, the butcher was separate\nto the grocery store. And I went to the butcher,\nand I said, \"What can I cook?\" And he pulled out a chicken, and he said, \"This is the\neasiest recipe for you. Just put it on a pan in\nan oven, a hot oven.\" 'Cause back then, ovens\nweren't necessarily like 400 degrees or 450 or whatever. \"And put it in a hot oven\nfor one hour and enjoy.\" That was it. And so I went home. And actually, I also\nbought some french fries, I'll tell you that as well. So I'm a kid, of course\nI want french fries. So I had roast chicken with french fries. And the chicken came out,\nand it was just fantastic. - It was? - Absolutely fantastic. - That's incredible, by the way. - [Kimbal] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You didn't screw it up the first time. - First of all, I think that\nalso kicks off the magic. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like if you screw it\nup, and you're like, \"Oh, maybe this is not for me.\" So for me, it really did kick it off. (Lex laughs) - You started out on a high note. - Yeah, right, exactly. But I can tell the french fry\npart, which was a disaster. So I cooked the french fries, but I didn't heat the oil first, so I just put the potatoes in the oil, and I waited for it to heat up. And I just was throwing\nup later that night. 'Cause your body can't ingest that much, 'cause it sucks the oils in. - Oh, oh, wow. - And so that was a disaster, but at the time it tasted good. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) The real magic, which I\nalso found was wonderful, was when I cooked, you know,\nmy brother and my sister, my mom all very, very\nbusy, very intense people, would sit down, and we\nwould have a meal together. And I was like, wow, this\nis a very powerful thing that I've now got, where in no other way could I have that\nconnection with my family. I mean, obviously we stay connected, we're very close, et cetera, but in no other way can we sit down and just talk about things. Or talk about whatever's on our mind, or just to just not even talk, just to be at the table together. And I've done that now\nthrough my whole life. My kids, still for my family. And we will do gratitudes at\nthe beginning of our meal. And it's just... I think that what kept me cooking, what made my love of cooking so great, was actually the fact\nthat we would sit down- - [Lex] Together. - And be present with each other. And I'm also just also\nhorrible with that too, so I also get to be present. - What is that about food that like, brings people together,\nand not just together, but like really together, where you're like paying attention? - [Kimbal] Right. - Like, what is that? Why is it food? Like, what else does that? Sometimes maybe alcohol can do that, which is a kind of food, I\nguess, as part of the experience. - Yeah, but I think alcohol is different because you're usually standing when you're doing alcohol,\nso like you're socializing, but it's gonna stay in more\nof the small talk zone. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Right? - Whereas if you sit down.... And I see this in my restaurant\nin The Kitchen in Boulder, where we have every viewpoint. Or we go to Denver, every viewpoint. When we're in Chicago, every viewpoint. And the physical presence of someone being with right there, is people, they're just very different. Absolutely different to\nwhat they are online. I think we all know the\ndifference between, you know, you send an email to someone, and they misunderstand the email, right? And you're like, \"Oh, if I\nhad just talked to the person, it would've been fine.\" Well, this is now happening at scale. You know, with all of these... What do you call it? Trolling or whatever. And I've sat at the bar, and I've had a hardcore Trump supporter. And I'm just curious, just like, \"Listen, tell me... I'm not a Trump supporter,\nbut like, tell me more.\" And it actually draws\nthe conversation out, because you're there\nfor an hour or longer. (Kimbal chuckles) So there's no rush to get the answer. And I think that's a big difference. I've had one time where,\njust a couple months ago, I had someone, I was sitting\nat the community table, we have a community\ntable in the restaurant. And I didn't know him too well, but he asked me, \"Did I know\nthat 9/11 was a conspiracy, and it didn't really happen.\" - [Lex] It didn't happen, yeah. - And I was like, \"Huh.\" So actually, I was at 9/11. I mean, I watched the towers fall. I was there, physically there. So it's like, no- - Allegedly. - There's no doubt in my mind. - Okay. - But I didn't wanna... (Kimbal and Lex chuckling) But I didn't wanna interrupt\nwhat he had to say. So I let him talk for five minutes, six minutes, seven minutes. And again, you're there for a while, so you're not in a rush\nto jump in and argue. And then I shared that I was there. And I think because I had\nbeen willing to listen to him, he was willing to listen to me. And I don't know if he changed his mind. He certainly didn't change my mind. But it was actually a\npretty cool conversation, to kinda get into each other's mind. - Well, I think you connect\non a different level, not on the level of like the conspiracy, but on the level of basic humanity. - Yes, exactly. - Like that's what you really connect on. And then it almost becomes\ninteresting and fun that you can exchange\nideas, even crazy ideas, out there ideas, and\nkind of play with them. Like, we humans are good at that. - Yeah, exactly. I like the term \"play with them\". Because what you're not trying to do is shut the conversation down. You're also not trying to- - [Lex] Talk down on them. - Yeah, exactly. Like, \"Oh, this guy's... Let me just be nice while I totally disagree\nwith this person.\" You can do that for a few minutes, you can't do that for two hours. - And there's something\nabout food that completely... I don't know, it must be evolutionary, that it makes us vulnerable in a way, that even just standing there for a prolonged period of time doesn't. There's something about... (Lex chuckles) You know like, when the animals gather to the water or whatever. - [Kimbal] Yeah, right. - Like this kind of experience\nwhere you're just like, \"All right, let's just\nacknowledge together that we need sustenance.\" - Yup. - And somehow that kind\nof grounds us to like, we're just a bunch of descendants of apes. (Kimbal laughs) Here just kinda like,\ngrateful to be alive. - [Kimbal] Yeah.\n- Frankly. And grateful to be consuming this thing which keeps us alive. And in that context, you can\ntalk about all kinds of stuff. You can discuss Flat Earth and enjoy it. - Absolutely. Abso... In fact, one of my favorite things to do, is you do like a\nJeffersonian style dinner. Like let's say five or six people. Sometimes people will break off into individual conversations. That's actually when things break down. So that's when you kinda\ngo back to small talk. Like, \"Oh, I'm stuck next to this guy, I'm just gonna do a little small talk.\" What you need to do to really create a great conversation is, one conversation at the table. And that's where, you know, there'll be some simple\nquestions that I'll say. I'll say, \"What's your middle name?\" And you'll be amazed at the\nstories you get from that. But it's about creating vulnerability. - [Lex] Yeah. - So they're like, \"Oh, no one's\never asked me that before.\" So then they become vulnerable. And then something as simple as, \"What's the most fun thing\nyou've done recently, and what is the most fun thing\nyou're looking forward to?\" - [Lex] Mhm. - And I have gotten into... With those prompts, I've gotten into hours long discussions on God. - [Lex] Mhm. - I've gotten into hours\nlong discussions on love. I've got into hours long\ndiscussions on anger. It's actually amazing when people are just asked a question like, \"What's the most fun\nthing you've done lately?\" Well, why would anger come up? Well, actually, they're\nin a vulnerable place, so that it'll just kind\nof come out of them. - So you get to see this. You get to see this at The Kitchen. And you said Boulder, Denver, Chicago? - Yeah, and we're gonna open in Austin. - In Austin. That's what I saw. When? When? - In October is the goal. - In October is the goal. Well, I mean, speaking of\ncharacters and human beings, Austin is fascinating. I've... I forget how long ago, I mean, a couple months ago, I\nwas just sitting at a bar, and the two people were talking, and they were talking about Marxism. And it turns out that\nthey're anarcho-communists? Which is a thing? And I got into this conversation- - A communist that likes drugs? (Lex and Kimbal laughing) - That's a good question to ask. (Kimbal and Lex laughing) - I think I know some of those. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) - Anyway, they were beautiful people. I think they're local from Austin. I don't know the depth of\ntheir personal experience of the different kinds of\ncommunist-like systems, but it was fascinating to listen to, and then get to know them. And the humanity, the\nweirdness, like the characters. It's just... I mean, I love it. One of the reasons I really love Austin, I decided to be here, is just the cliche thing\nof \"Keep Austin Weird\". I mean, there's a lot of weird characters. - I love it. I think... I've talked to a lot of Austinites\nwho've been here forever, and I'm like, \"Man, you\ngotta hold us accountable. We gotta keep this place weird.\" (Lex laughs) - A hundred percent. Which makes the restaurant seem great, because you have all\nthese characters come in. It's great. So I look forward to that. But you were saying like, you get to see humans\nin real life interact. That's one of the beautiful things. - Yeah.\n- Over food. In the book you write, Picasso once said, \"The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.\" Then you wrote that you\nbelieve food is a gift we give ourselves three times a day. Can you explain that? The gift nature of it? - Yeah, it's actually... I think it's one of my\nmost powerful life lessons, is we have to eat. So it's not like you have a choice. You have to eat. And so what I choose to do is, I'm gonna choose to make it a\ngift to myself for each meal. And most of the time, the best gift is with\nfriends, with family. So I'll have to cook some scrambled eggs in the morning with my daughter, or we'll have dinner with our family. To me, it's a gift we give\nourselves three times a day, you know, at least. But for the most part, three times a day. Let's make it a good one. - What makes it a good one to you? Like, what aspect makes it a good one? - Well, first definitely\neating with people. So, that makes it a good one. So eating in a restaurant, it doesn't have to be my restaurant. where you have the energy\nof people around you, energy of the town, people you don't know. It creates a little bit of a vibe. You mentioned the watering hole analogy, the animals like sipping at the water. But there's an energy to that\nbecause they're also like, looking around going, \"Am\nI just about to be eaten?\" - Yeah. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) - So they're all in it together, but we need to have water. But there's still a little\nbit of tension as well in the background. And I think that's what restaurants do. A very, very subtle version of that. You're in a room with strangers. And you're a little cluster, okay, fine. You guys are connected and... - [Lex] Yeah. - But you're in a room with strangers, and there's just something that adds that energy to the meal. - Yeah, you're a little\nbit wondering like, \"What does everyone else think\nabout our little cluster?\" - Right. Like, are we too loud? Or just, also just people are random, so something random could happen. - And also, depending on your personality, if you're an extrovert, maybe you wanna show off\nto the other clusters. - Exactly, yeah. Absolutely. Totally right. I mean, you know... Look at the cowboy hat. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) I mean, actually, I'll take my hat off when I wanna have a quiet meal, and I can leave my hat on when I'm- - Oh, so you're aware of the- - I'm aware of the effect it has. Yeah, absolutely. - Everyone turns in the night. (Kimbal laughs) - [Kimbal] That's right. - And then it's back to the watering hole. 'Cause when you wear a cowboy hat, you just might actually not- - Yeah, yeah, I'm like... They're gonna get me first. (Kimbal and Lex laughing) - At noon. I love it. - I gotta tell this story. We talked to the craziness of\nbeing in the restaurant world, where, you know, you're\nsitting at a table, and anything can happen in the restaurant. So there's one time, it\nwas like 15 years ago, this guy comes up to us and says he'd like to propose to\nhis wife, his girlfriend. And so we said \"Okay, cool. We've done this before. We'll make sure it's all set up.\" 6:00 PM kind of reservation. So she shows up, and we give\nher a glass of champagne. We didn't, obviously, didn't\nwanna spoil a surprise, so we're just doing everything we can. But then he doesn't arrive. (Lex laughs) And then we're like, \"Oh, man.\" Now we're like, \"Don't leave! Can we get you another\nglass of champagne?\" We're doing everything we can, because the guy was\nobviously earnest earlier. We're just, \"Is he stuck\nin traffic or whatever?\" And out coming through the\nback door of the restaurant, which, you're not allowed to come through the back door of the restaurant, a marching band from the\nschool, the university, like comes through the\nrestaurant, you know, full on brass band and the whole thing. And he gets down, and he proposes... And it's beautiful, sure, but it's also like-\n- [Lex] Chaos. - Man, this is chaos. This is insane. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) And we would never have said yes to this if he'd actually told\nus what he was gonna do. - Yeah, well, sometimes in life, you have to do it and apologize. - You do it and apologize. But that talks to that kind of, what's a crazy thing that could happen... It's subtle, but it's still there. - So in 2004, you opened The Kitchen. It's an American bistro restaurant. What was it like, what's it\nlike running a restaurant? The good, the bad and the ugly? What's the easy, what's the\nfun, and what's the hard? - I think the thing that I absolutely love about running the\nrestaurant, not eating in it, but running the restaurant, is the tangible reaction from people. And you also kind of know\nwhen you've screwed it up, and you also know when you got it right. It's kind of a weird way to say this, but even if the customer's unhappy, you know whether you\ngot it right or wrong. It's not just about\nthe food you're making, but it's about the person's\npsychological state. - [Lex] Yeah. - And you'll do something\nthat you're like, you know that was not done well. And their psychological state is they're just in a very\nhappy place, and they love it. And you're like, \"Huh, interesting.\" Like, that's not how I\nwould've reacted to that dish. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then the other way around. You're like, \"No, I got that right\" And that person's just\nlike really unhappy today. - Yeah. And it's so hard to read humans. 'Cause you have to... If you got it right, that can look a million different ways, depending on the emotional rollercoaster that human is living through. Like I've been at some very low points, and I've gone to like a restaurant alone, and just sitting there and be truly happy with just the zen aspect of it. And it was just like a great\nsteak or something like this. And maybe to other people around me, would look like I'm very unhappy, just because I'm within myself. - [Kimbal] Struggling with your day, yeah. - Yeah, within myself. But I'm truly happy\nwithin that struggle, so. Yeah, it's interesting. But you can kind of tell. - Yeah, you can tell. You mentioned being at the bar. The most gifted bartenders\nreally understand that. You know, it goes beyond... What's also great about a restaurant, it goes beyond the one time\nexperience that you walk in and have that experience. Is the good bartenders, they remember you. \"Oh, you were in a few months ago.\" And... \"This is kind of your thing,\nyou might need a little time.\" And other people will come\nin, they want a conversation. - [Lex] Yeah. - Or other people come in, and they're going through a divorce, and they just wanna be sad for a moment. Have a scotch.\n- [Lex] Yeah. (Lex chuckles) - And it's amazing what you\nlearn in the restaurant world, to just be connected to humanity. - Yeah. What is that about bars? That's a different experience. You said the table, the communal- - The table is when you\nconnect with people, learn about each other. Bars, you can sometimes do that. You can talk left and right, but you have the freedom\nto always break free. Like you can say, \"Oh, okay, great, I'm gonna go back to my meal.\" So it's kinda like a friend you can turn on and off at any time. Because the bartender knows\nthat, they're trained. Like if you want attention,\nI'm gonna give it to you. If you don't, I'm gonna stay away. If you wanna be chatty,\nI'm gonna be chatty. If you wanna be completely in your head, I'll leave you in your head. - There's also strangers\nkinda next to you, that you kinda... There's a feeling with the bar, that you're kind of alone together. - [Kimbal] Yeah.\n- Right? - And you can reach out. You can add some conversation,\nor you can choose not to. - And you can exit quickly. - You can exit. Exactly.\n(Lex laughing) It's a really good exit. So, bars are wonderful. And I love going to a bar\nby myself, after work. I might have a scotch, might\neven not even have alcohol, just have some thing. And maybe have a snack or\nsomething before dinner, because I'm gonna go home and\nhave dinner with the family. And that 20 minutes is just\nan amazing state change, from daytime to nighttime. Whereas if I went straight home, I'm like still in my head, and I'm just trying to get grounded, and I'm not as pleasant of a person. So that's another powerful use of a bar, is just like a transition time. - Well, I mean, it would\nbe remiss not to mention the other use of the bar, which is like, when you're going through\nsome shit in life. And you just go. I mean, it's the cliche thing. I've been... - Writing your stories? - Yeah, exactly. (Kimbal laughing) - But like the bar makes the melancholy somehow like rich and beautiful, and like you feel heard in the silence. - Yes.\n(Lex laughing) Yes, you feel heard. Like I said earlier, people\ngoing through a divorce, they don't know where else to go. - [Lex] Yeah. - These are mostly men. Sometimes women will do it,\nbut mostly men will do this, and women have other\nways of processing it. But they just... They want a place to be sad. They want a place where they could feel comfortable talking about it. They're certainly not gonna\ngo into too much detail, but they just wanna say something. - [Lex] Yeah. - And the bartender is there for them. - Yeah. You don't know where to go. - You don't know where to go, exactly. - And the bar... (Kimbal laughs) Yeah, you're right. Like for men especially,\nis a place to just go. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - And just... I don't know. What is that? - I mean-\n- What is that? - I'll be honest, I still do it myself, where if I'm at home, and I don't have a work\nthing that I gotta deal with, and I don't have kids,\nand I don't have my wife or a family around, I don't often cook for myself. I actually love going to a bar, by myself. I have a glass of red wine, and I usually don't have\na starter or appetizer, just like a main meal. And I just take in the\nenergy of the space. If it's my restaurant,\nsomeone else's restaurant. I just take in the energy. And it's so much better\nthan being home and, what, turn the TV on? No, no, no, no, no. I wanna be out in the restaurant. I wanna feel the energy of the town. The other thing that\nrestaurants teach me is, they're the front lines of the economy, or what's a better word for it? Just like front lines of the\nenergy of how things are going. - Oh, like, of a peoples in general? Like, it doesn't necessarily\nmean this part of town, but it could be the entire society. - Yeah, exactly. So you can go into a restaurant and... I'll use a simple example. And why is the restaurant empty? Ah, there's a football game going on. And there's such a large number of people that wanna watch that game, that the restaurant is quiet. Or it might be like World\nSeries or something. And you're like, \"Wow,\nthat's so interesting.\" You can actually watch,\nin American of course, American humanity, you can watch them move in their patterns, just by being in the restaurant. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - And then another time you\nmight be in a restaurant, and it's just jamming. And it's a Monday night, and you're like, \"What is the energy that\ncreated this on a Monday night?\" And maybe even on a cold February,\nMonday night, what is it? And sometimes you can't find\nout, but you could feel it. And it's my front lines of humanity that I also just really\nlove about the restaurants. - Yeah, it could be\nempty, it could be full. Empty bars... There's a magic to those too. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - You could still feel that energy. I don't know. - I actually prefer empty\nbars than full ones. - It's just you and the bartender. I mean, some of my greatest experiences is just the quiet bar, with just me and the bartender, and they're doing their thing. And they've seen so many... I have almost like,\nthrough osmosis somehow, feel the stories that\nthat bartender has seen, has felt, has heard. - [Kimbal] Yeah.\n- And all that kind of stuff. I mean, not to be sort of... Like spiritual about it, but it seems like it's in\nthe walls or something. Like the history is felt. - And then some of these\nbars are actually very old, and it's wonderful. Like, there are many in Europe like this, but there's a couple in New York City, few hundred years old, and they're still operating\nnonstop for that long. And man, you feel it. - Yeah. Let me ask you some\nquestions about ingredients. What's your favorite\ningredient to cook with? - For me, cooking is an art, right? So it'd be like asking me what's my favorite paint color to use. It's not there isn't one, it's more like when there\nis one, it really is one. You know, like there's peaches on the cover of this cookbook. Those peaches, those were\nin August, Colorado peaches. It just doesn't get any better than that. - On that day, at that\nmoment, that was the best. - That was the best. But that only lasts for a week. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then they don't taste so great. - Yeah.\n(Kimbal laughs) But damn are they so good in that moment, and you just can't stop\nwanting to use that ingredient. - They look really good. - [Kimbal] They're so good. - What's your favorite fruit? I love veggies and fruit. What's your favorite fruit? - I love a smoothie bowl,\nso I do sort of berries, raspberries... But I use fruit more in\nthe form of a smoothie bowl than I eat fruit that often. I like an apple or a banana, but for the most part, I\nprefer like the blended. - Not me. I love... The way you casually\nsaid, \"I like an apple.\" I mean- - A good apple is pretty great. - For me, it's a problem, I think. (Kimbal laughs) Probably cherries number one. Probably... What are they called? Granny Smith apples number two. - Oh yeah, those are great. But try it when... Sometime, come to Colorado in August, and when you try those peaches, it is like heaven has\narrived in your mouth. It is so ridiculously good. (Kimbal laughs) - But just for a week in August. - Just for a week. You can't have it all year long. (Kimbal laughs) - What about veggies? You wrote that Chef Hugo\nthat you worked with, co-founded The Kitchen with, taught you the power of a good vegetable. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - What's the power of a good vegetable? - So I've trained in New York, right? As a French chef. But it wasn't very much\ningredients focused, it wasn't very much sourcing focused. He came from the River Cafe in London, which was one the OGs\nof the farm-to-table, and still going strong today. And he taught me the value\nof getting to know farmers, and getting to know\nvegetables from that farm, versus vegetables from that farm. And they're actually different. The soil's a little different. The way they grow it a little different. It's the opposite of\nthe industrial machine, where everything needs\nto look exactly the same. And sometimes you'll get carrots that are kinda ugly and deformed, but they're much sweeter than the carrots you'd get for other purposes. So you'd make a carrot puree out of that. And then you take carrots that are more typical in shape and size, you might roast them for dinner. So it's the appreciation\nfor vegetables in general. I probably would say\ncarrots is my favorite, just 'cause that was an example of one where I really had to learn how to use the different types of carrots that come from from all of our farms. And it's fun. You know, it's a fun ingredient. If you just went to the Whole Foods, or just went to a grocery store, and you just got exactly\nthe same carrot every time, less fun. But go to a farmer's market\nand see what you get, and you'll see they're quite different. - Yeah, carrot for me\nis probably number one. I have rigorous detailed\nrankings for fruit and veggies. - [Kimbal] That's amazing! - We'll get into it. No, I'm just kidding. (Kimbal laughs) Well, I am the kind of person that would have like a\nspreadsheet for that. - [Kimbal] That's great. - But I'm mostly just\nmaking fun of myself. I do love carrots. I wish they weren't so\nfull of carbs, but... - Yeah, I'm just not anti-carbs, you know? I think-\n- Anti-carbs, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, I think they play a role. Like, I have a great friend\nwho's an amazing doctor, and he did some tests\nfor me and everything, and turns out I have a gluten allergy. And I was like, \"Okay. So what that means is,\nI shouldn't eat gluten.\" He's like, \"Yeah.\" It's like, okay, but\nI also have hay fever, and that means I should\nnot go out into nature. So I was like, nah, I think\nI'm gonna go out into nature. And maybe what I'll do\non bread and pasta is, or like the true carbs, I'll just have it when it's really good. - [Lex] Mhm. - Because when it's really\ngood, it's really good. And you don't wanna miss that. Most of the time, okay, fine, there's some crummy bread or whatever. Like, I can skip that part. But I find all of these\ndiets, they're like, \"No, none of this.\" Or, \"Super this, super that.\" I wonder if people are just looking for something to hang on to. But these diets have been around forever, and if they work, then we would know that. - Yeah, I think one of the\nbiggest problems with diets is, it adds stress when you do have\nthat perfect bowl of pasta. And if you have categorized yourself as a low-carb eating person, you might be very stressed\nabout enjoying this thing. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - When you should just let go. - Let go. This is your \"cheat day\" or whatever. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - And I've heard that. And actually, I have friends\nwho do that, their cheat day, and I say to them, \"I'm only gonna hang out\nwith you on your cheat day, because that's when you're actually fun.\" (Kimbal and Lex laughing) - Yeah, I mean, I would say like for me, there's things that make\nme feel really good, but they're not rules. They're not... They're like go-to favorites. Like in terms of diet and so on. For example, I've mostly\nbeen eating once a day. - Oh, wow. - For the longest time. But that's not a rule. Like, it's completely flexible. And I've mostly been eating very low-carb. - Okay, but you must\nbe eating a lot of food in that one meal. - Yeah, it's not, you know, because it's usually\nvery sort of meat heavy. It's not like portions\nare not that big, so. - But your body needs food. - Yeah, body needs food. So you're talking about\nlike 2000 calories. What you find out is like, that dinner, is like the most social time of the day. - Yeah. I mean, I have kids in the morning, so if you have kids, it's for\nsure a morning experience, but if you don't, then you're right. - Yeah. But like you said, I deviate. I'm more afraid of missing\nthe perfect dessert, the perfect breakfast,\nthe perfect bowl of pasta, pizza, all that kind of stuff. - [Kimbal] Yeah, right. - I don't think of it as a cheat day. I think it's a... - Well, if you're only\neating one meal a day, you can eat whatever you like. (Kimbal laughs) - Well, like, I wanna make clear that it's not one meal a day always, and on like this very strict thing. It's... You always have to be\nopen to the experience, to the new experience. Otherwise you do miss out. 'Cause just like you said, hay fever. Like, I think if you want be really safe, you should never leave your home. - Yes, just wrap... We learned during COVID, if you wrap yourself in\ncotton wool in your basement- - [Lex] Yes. - You're not going to die from COVID. You might die from a lot of other things, of just pure misery. - Yeah.\n(Kimbal laughs) Well, you might live forever. (Kimbal laughs) - Right? We don't know. - But it certainly\ndoesn't maximize the joy, of whatever makes life worth living. It doesn't maximize that. - Yeah, exactly. - You wrote in the book\nthat Anthony Bourdain was one of your heroes. Can you speak to what\ninspired you about him? - Yeah, he wrote a book called \"Kitchen Confidential\", in the 90s. I was in cooking school at the time. It was so... He romanticized cooking\nin the restaurant so well. His writing is great. So he kind of got me into like, \"Oh, that's cool. I want to do that.\" It was cool. So, you know, got into cooking school, got more engaged in it. And it was like I had\nthis FOMO feeling of, I wanted to experience what\nit's like to be in the back... When you're in cooking\nschool, you are in the back. They had a restaurant,\nwe would serve people. But it's not the same thing\nas actually being in a... A real restaurant, it's\nlike you're in a submarine with your teammates, and\nyou gotta win tonight. Like, it's a real energy. And so, that was a big inspiration. I followed him. It was so sad that he\nchose to end his life. But I also had met with him a few times. Not like one-on-one\nover dinner or anything, but just like, met with him, and just felt his love for food. And truly, just love for food. - He gave the advice of, \"Don't be afraid, get\nexcited and cook with love.\" - Yeah. I've used that phrase, especially\nthe cook with love one. I mean, you know, one of the things about, which we talked about this earlier where, you get quick, tangible\nfeedback from a customer when you're in the restaurant. I know when I didn't\nput love into that dish. I know when one of my line cooks did not put love into\nthat part of the dish. I know when that export\nperson did not put love into, you know, double checking the dish before putting it on the table. You just know. And \"cook with love\" is, whether you do it for your family. Oh, actually, especially when\nyou do it for your family. The food doesn't have to be perfect, but you're cooking with love. - That's why you love scrambled eggs. - I do that, it's- - That's in the book,\nKimbal Scrambled Eggs. - Yes. - You promised to make me scrambled eggs, and I'm gonna hold you to it. - That's great. (Kimbal and Lex laughing) A cooking school you mentioned. The French Culinary Institute. I heard it was a bit of a\nrough experience in parts. - I would call it... It's not a rough experience in that- - In a beautiful way. - Yeah, exactly. It's not like I'm a victim of it. It's rough in that they\nintentionally make it rough. So the school costs the same\nprice as Harvard to go to. You show up, it's an 18 month program. You are allowed to drop out at any time, you don't get your money back. 25 people started, six people graduated. And the people who graduated... I graduated, but man, there\nwere times where I'm like, \"I can't handle this.\" I mean, I would literally\nsay to my friends, \"Oh, I gotta go to cooking school. I'm gonna go get screamed at for the next six or seven hours.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And I had this little French\nchef, who was my nemesis. - Does he still live\nin your head somewhere? - He still lives in my head. Exactly! He totally does. He's like 5'2\" or something. And I remember him\nscreaming so much at me. He's like the short guy, I'm 6'5\". The spittle would land on my face. - [Lex] Nice. - And I would just have to sit there, or stand there and take it. It was a very humbling experience. I did learn though that\nit's intentionally rough. So it took a little\nbit of the edge off it. One day, when that same\nchef had come over to me and said, \"Move over a little bit.\" And then I moved over. And he took my carrots, whatever, and started just chopping everything. And like perfectly. And then he said, \"Okay,\nnow you can come back.\" And then he went over to someone else, and started screaming\nat them, saying that, \"Look, even Kimbal can do this. And you can't do this.\" And I was like... This whole thing's like a psycho game. - [Le] Yeah.\n(Kimbal laughs) - So it did take the edge\noff when I realized it was... - [Lex] Yeah. - Like the guy was intentionally\ntrying to break you down. And they do this apparently in the Army. I've not been to the Army, but... They need to break you down, everything you know is worthless, so that then we can teach you, and you can come out of it with what actually we want you to know. - Are there specific technical lessons you remember you learned from that? Sort of how to cut carrots, or how to approach food, how to prepare food,\nhow to think about food, how to carry yourself in the kitchen. You know?\n- All of those things. I think that of the most beautiful lessons was actually scrambled eggs. So, there's different layers of chefs. So they're all master chefs, they're all very well known\npeople and everything. But Alain Sailhac was one of the chief, like main, main guys. And he just passed away. A master chef. And everything kind of stopped when he would show up in the kitchen. And he would teach very few things. And all of the other\nchefs who would, you know, the same ones that were screaming at us, just like, it was like\nthe Red Sea parting. Like they have total\nrespect for this human, and he can do whatever he wants. And one of the things\nhe wanted to teach was, how do you make an\nomelet, a French omelet? And it's really\nfundamentally the same thing. It's a soft scrambled egg that you fold. And the love that he put\ninto the time with us, and of course he's a legend. There were moments like that\nwhere I'm like, \"Wow, okay.\" He also, just like the other chefs, didn't have any concern berating anyone. So he berated our master chefs. - [Lex] Nice. - Saying, \"I don't trust\nthese people to teach you how to make scrambled eggs. So I'm gonna do it instead.\" (Kimbal laughs) - I mean, can you speak to that? 'Cause you know, a lot\nof people hearing this would be like, \"Scrambled eggs? Like, why do you need to be a master chef to really make scrambled eggs?\" - Well, first of all, for me, and it's a learning journey forever. So, I make scrambled eggs. I mean, I must've made it\n10,000 times or more, whatever. - So it's like \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\", \"Kimbal Dreams of Scrambled Eggs\"? - Pretty much.\n- [Lex] Okay. - So I will wake up, and be held accountable by my\nkids to make scrambled eggs. This happens every morning. And... I know all the steps, muscle\nmemory level kind of steps. (Kimbal mumbles) And then I'll cook it, and it's very meditative for me, because you have to focus. So most scrambled eggs,\nsoft scrambled eggs recipes are 10, 15 minutes to get\nthem to that perfect softness. And the recipe that I\ngot from Chef Alain was, something that you can do in 90 seconds. But it requires total focus. Like if you like look up for a second, you're going to miss the perfect moment, when you have to stop and\nget those eggs outta the pan. (Lex chuckles) Because the eggs will keep cooking. And so it's this meditation. And sometimes, you hit it like perfectly. But most times, eh... It could've been a little softer, could've been a little firmer, could've been a little bit more salt, could've been a little bit more of pepper. And so, what's really\nfun about the morning is, my kids are kinda into it. So like, we critique the eggs. - [Lex] Yeah. - Every morning. - Do they have a rating system? Or back to the spreadsheet? - It's more like... And again, it also comes back\nto how do people feel, right? So my kids can be in a bad\nmood, and they can be grumpy. - Or it's like a Michelin\nstar system, like what- - No, no, it's more like, \"Oh, yeah, I like my eggs\na little more gooier.\" Or, \"Yesterday it was this way, but a little bit more\nsalt, a little less salt.\" Salt is usually the one that is... Because not all salts are equal. So if you are used to working\nwith a certain kind of salt, and then you just are\nforced, for some reason, you ran outta salt, so\nyou use some other salt, you actually don't know how to use it. You really want to have\nthe same salt all the time. - Yeah, you have a page\non salt in the book. - Yeah, totally.\n- Which was fascinating. - Salt is... You gotta get to know your salt, you gotta love your salt, and you gotta use it over\nand over and over again. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it will teach you\nhow to use that salt, where by, your own palette will tell you how salty you like things. But if you change it up, and you mix up a whole bunch of salt, you've now multiplied your learning path. So for me, I, my favorite\nsalt is Kosher salt. And I like to use that all the time. And if I ever change it, I might sprinkle a little\nbit of molten salt. Just crunchy, sort of a flaky salt. But it's more for that when\nyou're actually eating- - [Lex] For the texture. - It gives you texture\nas well as salt, exactly. You wouldn't use it on scrambled eggs. But if you switch out your\nsalts, it's a different weapon. - Yeah, yeah.\n(Kimbal laughs) You need to learn it. - I like how, you know, usually\nthere's wine connoisseurs. You're saying, going back\nto sort of farm-to-table, when you're talking about carrots in that same rigor and nuance, you have to consider the different farms involved for the carrots. In that same way, you have to\nconsider the different salts. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - With like- - And also not even all\nKosher salts are the same. It's the particular salt that\nyou like, get to know it. Get in a relationship with it. It's like, great. You will learn so much. - In terms of the\nmeasurement, the proportion, the amount of salt you put in, are you doing that like exactly? Or are you doing it by feel? - So, it's by feel, and that's where you get the relationship. So in fact, in the cookbook, I have QR codes that people can scan. Because what I struggle with recipes is, they don't teach you technique, right? They can describe the technique, but they don't teach the technique. 'cause it's a technique,\nit's not a recipe. And so one of the lessons\nis, how do you salt a steak? And the answer is not... \"Here's a teaspoon, and\nyou do it this way.\" The answer is use kosher salt, so you can see with your eyes, 'cause they're little flakes, how much salt is on your steak. And then cook it, and then taste it. You know? Do you think you need more\nor do you need it less? Okay, now next time, put a little more on it,\nbecause you can see it. And it's about learning the\nthe fact that you want to be able to see how much\nsalt is on the steak, so that you can then train\nyourself for the future of how much salt you want on your steak. - Yeah, but then the steak and the salt kind of dance together. It depends on where the steak came from. - That's true, that's true. Or the thickness of the steak. That'll make a difference. But for the most part,\nif you're able to see it, versus table salt, for\nexample, it just disappears. You just can't see what\nyou're putting on your steak. You can't really learn as a result. - I think you talk about roast chickens, where your love of food began. Well, what about steak? - Well, I mean, I love a good steak. It's so great. - So in the French school, you add sauces and all this kind of stuff, and in Boulder is when you realize like there's a beauty to the basic ingredient. - Simplicity, yeah. Like a good New York strip\nfrom a good rancher that... There's a lot of discussion, controversy, on how cattle should be raised. And we have a very different\napproach, which is, we know how our cattle are raised. We go to the farm. We get to know the rancher. And sometimes you do wanna\nhave them be finished on, like, they'll be grass-fed\nfor the most part, but then there's some sort of cool recipe of food you're giving them that will then make them taste better. And sometimes, it is actually pretty good to have a hundred percent grass-fed. I've had some amazing\nranchers that showed me that the flavors are all there. For the average person that, you know, might go to a Whole\nFoods or a grocery store, I think the simplicity of a good steak... It is important to get good sourcing, but also it's just good. - What's your favorite cut of meat? 'Cause New York strip... Probably New York strip for me. - Yeah, New York strip. Yeah. I like the fact that it's\nlean, but if you want the fat, you can dive into that\nlittle strip of fat, or you can leave it alone, 'cause you don't want it that night. And it's also a great\nsteak for adding something. Like if you wanna... You could either do like a pepper sauce, or you could do a lot of ground pepper, which gives it a peppery, not sauce, but it's a peppery steak. It's a really good steak for\nlike a canvas for other things. - But the basic ingredients\nyou're playing with is salt and pepper? - Yeah, pretty much. - [Lex] And then just the steak. - Actually, I will say\nthere's another one. Garlic. This is my favorite recipe for a steak is, you season it both sides, salt and pepper. You saute it in a little\nolive oil, barely anything, and you're getting a nice crisp, like a dark golden brown on both sides. The other trick with cooking\na steak is, don't touch it. You know, you just put one side. When you're ready to\nturn it, turn it around. Don't touch any other time. But at the end, you take a dab of butter, and you crush a clove of garlic. You don't even chop it,\nyou just crush the clove. And you put the two of them in the pan, and you just roll the steak\naround in the garlic butter. I think that's the way. - Bold move, Kimbal. (Kimbal laughs)\nBold move. Since you're in Austin quite a bit, opening a restaurant here, what do you think about barbecue? It's kind of the Texas way. - Well, I would say there's an Austin way. - [Lex] Definitely an Austin way. - And actually even Austin would say there's a suburb of Austin way, like- - [Lex] Yes. (Kimbal laughs) - I think that actually, the\nadventure of food is wonderful. I would absolutely say that Austin is one of the great food cities of America. And barbecue is one of its\ngifts that it gives the city. But you go to one and the other, and you'll have a different approach. And that's the part I love. Is where there's a real\ncelebration of the artisan. So you might go to one, and they have a style that they love, and they've been doing it for years. And then you'll go to another, and they have a style that they love and they've been doing it for years. And it's still barbecue, but\nthey're actually different. And it's really beautiful to see that. That's what food culture is. Like, it just builds up over time, by people who love this style of cooking. - Well, I especially love the communal, like how they structure\nrestaurants usually. Or... I don't even wanna call it a restaurant, 'cause it doesn't feel like a restaurant. It feels like a tavern or some sort. Like Terry Black's is like that. It's like- - [Kimbal] Yeah, they also\nhave like paper towels. - [Lex] Yeah. - Get as messy as you like. And it's a whole roll of paper towels. They don't just give you a napkin. They know what you're getting into. - Yeah. And there's just wood everywhere,\nand it kinda has this feel like this place has been around forever. It's not changing. I know it's the 21st\ncentury with the internet and all this kinda- - [Kimbal] Yeah. - \"Nonsense that you people are building, but really this is all about the same.\" - [Kimbal] Yes. - \"It's been the same for generations. We're doing it the same.\" That kinda feel. If you want to escape\nthe world in that way, and then truly connect with people. - One of the other things that'll happen in a town like Austin is, there'll be a barbecue joint\nthat is just legendary, right? And then out of that will come someone who wants to go do their\nown barbecue joint, and they'll take the learning\nfrom that barbecue joint. They'll open up a new one, but it won't be the same as\nthe other barbecue joint. Part of it's just like, \"Dude, like don't just do the same thing. Like do something... What do you have to say?\" - Mhm. - But also part of it is, if you're in the world of\nfood, like as an art form, and you want to go open up\nanother barbecue joint... You kinda wanna prove yourself. Like, I deserve to have a\nbarbecue joint in this town. I know this is one of the\nholy grails of barbecue. - [Lex] Yeah. - And people will follow you like they're following a musician, or they're following an artist. And they are excited to\nsee what your version is, and how well you can pull it off. It's like, it's actually, that's what I mean by like\na city with a food culture. Austin has that. - There's also like a\nlegend to certain places. Certain places are more than\njust the food they create. It's like... That could be a burden. You have to like, live up to the legendary\nnature of the name. - Our restaurant in Boulder,\nThe Kitchen, is 20 years old. We're very well known,\nwe're very well respected. And we do have to live up to the name. I think that our restaurant\nlives up to its name in not just the food, it's like you walk in and\nyou feel the restaurant. And that is also something\nwe've just done naturally. The space is 120 year old\nbuilding, used to be a brothel, then it was bookstore. Like, storied history. - [Lex] That's an interesting date. - No, literally. This was a mining town, right? So back in the 1800s, this was built late 1800s, that sort of brothels, that was a thing. And so there's an actual\ntunnel in the basement, that goes to the local hotel, that would be used for\ngoing back and forth between the hotel and the\nbrothel, without people knowing. And the tunnel is now concreted up. But you can go about 20,\n30 feet into the tunnel. (Kimbal laughs) But you go into the space, and it's actually an old space, so you feel like it's been there forever. - Yeah. In 2010, you had a\nlife-threatening accident that changed the way\nyou see life, the world, also the way you see food and cooking. Can you tell me the story of it? - Yeah. So 2010, I was 37. I had opened the restaurant in 2004. And I had loved the\nrestaurant world, loved it. But I didn't really want to\ngrow a restaurant company. That wasn't my goal. And so I went back into technology, and I had gone from something that I love, to something that I like. For me it was like... It was like chewing sawdust every day. I just couldn't believe\nthat I had changed my life. and gone back into technology. And now I do do work in\ntechnology, and I do love it, but I found a better relationship with it. But I was really, really unhappy. From the outside, I was a\nsort of CEO of a hot startup. But from the inside, I\nwas just very unhappy. And I was in Jackson Hole, and I was doing these very\naggressive snowboard runs. And I'm, at the time, a pretty\ngood, aggressive snowboarder. And I remember saying to myself, \"Look, I've got kids. I\nneed to chill on this.\" The next day was Valentine's Day. Tomorrow's Valentine's Day, I'm just gonna have a\nnice day with the family, and my wife at the time. And we went to a children's run, you do the inner tube run. And the tubes are small, but\neveryone uses the same tube. So I'm 6'5\", and my\nkids are four years old, and everyone uses the same size tube. It should have been a message to me, not to get on this thing. But I went and got on it, and on the first run and I went down, and you're going super\nfast, 35 miles an hour, and the tube hit the breaking\nmats, and it stopped. The tube just stopped where\nit was, it just threw me. My head was facing downhill, so that created the\nwrong center of gravity. So instead of breaking, it just threw me. I landed on my head. My head went into my chest, like compression into my\nchest, like down like that. I ruptured my spine at C6 an C7. And in like the blink of\na second, I was paralyzed. I was like, \"What?\" You know, just like\nimpossible to comprehend. And they put this thing halo on my head, and they take me to the hospital, which was more of a medical clinic. And I'm just like, \"What's going on here?\" - Do you remember your thoughts\nfrom the moment it happened, to like when you got to the hospital? - I remember being... So this is one of the things that actually the doctor said caused the most damage, was I was thrown from the tube, and I heard this big\ncrunch sound in my body. And I knew that I was hurt. But I didn't feel any pain. That's also... Why wouldn't you feel pain? 'Cause you know, you're\nparalyzed, you don't feel pain. And I'm face down on the snow, and the snow is burning my face. 'Cause you know, you can't do that. You need something... And I found a way to turn myself around, so that my face wouldn't be on the ground. But I knew I couldn't move. And that they said actually\ncaused more damage than... Well, obviously the accident\ncreated the opening, but once you move your body, the blood goes into the spinal\ncolumn at a faster rate, and that is what caused my paralysis. But I remember that and... I remember getting into the ambulance... - [Lex] Did you think you were gonna die? Like in those seconds, minutes. - It was a different feeling of death. It was more... It was more of a, \"What is going on here?\" Like I can't make sense\nof what's going on. There was a moment when\nI got to the hospital, and they did this MRI, and the doctor comes up to me and says, \"Look, we've done this MRI.\" So now I'm in the\nhospital, and I can't move. But I also don't even feel any pain. So I'm like, it's very confusing. Your body looks like you can move it. Like, look, see how I'm moving my hand? Like it looks like you can do that, and then it just doesn't move. There's no feedback loop\nthat it's not moving. Your brain even thinks it's\nmoving, but it's not moving. It's like the worst, like\nmost terrifying thing. So the doctor says, \"The way you broke your neck was at a zero degree angle. That is so rare. But as a result, there is\nno twisting of the spine. We think that we can get the blood out of your spinal column, and you should get some or maybe\nall of your movement back.\" And I was like, \"Oh, okay. I think I'm gonna be fine. I guess I'm gonna be fine.\" And then I realized I had tears just streaming down the side of my face. And I was like, \"Whoa, man. I have no idea what's going on.\" - So this kind of intense\nstate of confusion. I wonder if it's a kinda weird psychological defense mechanism, of like taking you away from the obvious possibility of death. - Yeah, it was for sure, all of the defenses were up. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) I don't know how else to describe\nit, but there was denial. - [Lex] Yeah. - There was... There was this curiosity of like, \"Why is there no pain?\" Like when they did actually\nrepair me and fix me, it was three days later... The pain was indescribable,\nhow much pain I was in. But there was no pain for three days. (Kimbal laughs) - The human body is fascinating. - [Kimbal] Man! - Wow... So they were able- - Yeah, so they did this surgery, but I had this very clear voice in my head that I kind of determined that it's God. I'm not religious, but I don't know how else\nto describe the voice. And his voice was very clear. \"You're gonna work with kids and food.\" Okay, where did that come from? I'm like tech CEO. I have a restaurant. And we were working with\nsome kids in schools, with like helping a local nonprofit. And he's like, \"No, you're just gonna\nwork on kids and food.\" And my good friend Antonio and my brother were in the hospital, and I was like, \"I'm gonna\nwork on kids and food.\" You know, 'cause they're like, \"He's crazy. He's lost his mind.\" But not that they were arguing,\nno one was arguing with me, but I was like, \"I'm\njust going to do that. I need to say it out loud.\" And I remember resigning\nfrom my job as the CEO, from the hospital. And that was it. It was just clear. It was a clear voice. Wasn't for a moment, wasn't like a flash of light or anything. It was probably two weeks of clear voice. - [Lex] Of clarity. - Clarity. Exactly, clarity. And no monkey brain, nothing. No monkey brain, just clarity. - So you're not a religious person, but you do call it the voice of God. Who is that God do you think? Like, who is that? - [Kimbal] Yeah. - Where did that come from? - Well, I've done ayahuasca, and I've spoken to what\nthey call Mother Aya, which is another version of God. It's a divine presence. Which is maybe, I think\nis a better way to say it. I've also had this debate in my head, like, maybe it's just me. I'm talking to me. And it's my peaceful, more kinder, less caught up in the emotion\nof the day version of me. Maybe it's me. Okay, maybe it is, but it's there. - But who are you? Like how deep does it go? What does \"you\" mean? You could be, you know, first of all, like the depth of what\nthe human mind even is, is a gigantic mystery. Consciousness, all of it. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - Like who are you? Like yeah, maybe it is you, but then maybe in order to build you, we need to build the universe. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - Like you are actually, fundamentally a part of\nthis whole human society. So the pieces of humans\nthat you've interacted with are all within you. And then maybe the history of the humans that came before are also in there. And maybe the entirety of life\non earth is also in there. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - And the whatever brought\nlife about on earth is in there somewhere. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - So that's all you. - Which is really true. Evolution literally is\ntrue, that we all are... The photons from the sun came in and- - [Lex] You're part fish. - We all came from that. I think this one... You know, so one of the\nthings I do is meditate. I've been meditating for many, many years. And the way I meditate is, I sit and I listen to my thoughts, and I simply just do that\nfor 15 to 20 minutes. And it just calms the nervous\nsystem, and I breathe, and just breathe through, because it's been a stressful day. And it's just a beautiful way to... I kinda do it around, Remember I said I used to do a\nscotch at the bar after work, now I go meditate instead. A little less-\n- Same thing. - A little bit better for my health. But the meditation I was taught was... Sam Harris actually taught me this. Was not so much just about\nwatching your thoughts, but realizing that you're a watcher. You're actually a watcher. You're not just like, who\nis the person watching you? That's you, actually. Your thoughts are floating\nthrough your mind, but you are the watcher. And I was like, \"Oh,\nthat's really interesting. Okay, so I'm gonna learn. I'm gonna be the watcher.\" And what I learned was, I'm watching these thoughts go by, and there's a consistent other presence. And I'm like, \"What is that\nconsistent other presence?\" It's not a thought. It's not something I can\nkind of let it float away. And it doesn't even wanna float away. It's just a consistent other presence that I can watch and feel. - So you are the watcher watching\nthe feelings and thoughts, but there's also an other\npresence next to you almost. - Yes. Yeah. That's how I feel. And it's a beautiful presence. It's not a presence that\nis trying to intervene. It's not a presence that is\ntrying to tell you what to do. It's just a beautiful presence. - And that might be part\nof the thing you met when you took ayahuasca. - I learned about Mother Aya, where you have this\nexperience of talking to... Actually, I would say the closest\nthing to breaking my neck, that feeling was ayahuasca. - Can you go through that experience? 'Cause I'm actually traveling to the Amazon jungle in a month, and I'll probably do\nayahuasca for the first time. - [Kimbal] Okay. - So, I need a preview. Unofficial instruction manual. - Yeah, sure. So first of all, I think many different\nways to do it, right? And I've done many, many different ways. There's a very western medicine approach, where you have doctors that\nlook after you during the day, you know, put an eye mask\non, you're on a futon, and you really are in a\nwestern medicine setting. And it's frankly for me, has been the most powerful experience. I feel the most comfortable, 'cause I'm part of western\nmedicine in my upbringing. The other... Extreme, but they're kind of in between, would be very probably\na Peruvian ceremony, where you're probably gonna go, very much about you do it in a community, you do it with others, and you feel people go through their pain and their processing. So I know the whole gamut. But the thing that I found\nmost powerful about it, and profoundly powerful, I would say. First of all, it's non-recreational. So no one should do this for a good time. This is not a good time. This is a very- - Almost traumatic? But in again, a beautiful way. - I was actually gonna say\nthat word, but it's not. It's not traumatic, it's profound. So it's more like you don't have... You really leave who\nyou were before behind, and then you become the\nperson you will be afterwards. (Kimbal laughs) - And that's never an easy thing. - Yes, exactly. And sometimes, what I recall was arguing with Mother Aya and saying, \"No, I'm fine. Like, what are you talking about? Like, leave me alone.\" (Kimbal laughs) And yeah, that- - How did that work out? (Lex and Kimbal laughing) But before 2010, the accident, and the two transformational\nexperiences you had, you were a very successful tech CEO. Maybe go back to the early days with Zip2. In 1994, you and Elon started Zip2. Tell me the story of that. - Yeah, so in '94 we actually\ndid a road trip around the US to brainstorm about what we\nwanted to do after college. - What was that road trip like? Was it- - That was awesome. So we went from Silicon\nValley to Philadelphia. - [Lex] Nice. - In my brother's old, like a really cool, you know, it's one of those very old BMWs, not ones from the 60s or 70s. But the car didn't work. It would break down all the time. But we had a blast. You know, we just... I remember going through Needles... On the border of California-Arizona, there's a town called Needles. It's the hottest place in America. And the engine was not cooling, so we had to put the heat on. So we had the heat blasting\nto cool the engine, keep the engine cool, and\nwe keep the windows down, because we can't stand\nthe heat in the car. But actually the outside heat is hotter than the inside heat. So you're just in a furnace\nas you're driving through. - [Lex] Just sweating. - It was at night, even. I can't imagine doing that- - [Lex] Oh, wow.\n- In the day. But yeah, it was wonderful. It took us a few weeks, I\nthink three weeks maybe. - First time across America? - First like a road trip like that. Yeah, for sure. But it was really not a\nroad trip for tourist sites. We went to the weirdest places. And actually I would\nsay we didn't go to 'em, we broke down in the weirdest places. - [Lex] Yeah. (Lex laughs) - Because that's when we stopped. - Did you meet any interesting people? - I remember we broke down in\nthe Badlands of South Dakota, about an hour from Rapid City. And that road is empty. And so we actually slept in the car, because there was just no one around. There's no cell phones in those days. And eventually a trucker picked us up. He was just like, \"Man, you guys are the\ndumbest kids on the planet.\" I was like 21, he was maybe 22. But he was so nice to\nus, and so kind to us, and found us a mechanic in Rapid City, and then found us a tow truck. And yeah, you find the\nmost wonderful people... When you're in a place of distress, people do wanna take care of other people. - They help you. - [Kimbal] Yeah, they wanna help. - And especially when\nyou're on a road trip... 'Cause I've taken a road trip\nacross the United States, and there's a part of people where they... They really love that. I think part of them\nwants to do that also. Wants to kind of escape whatever\nthe local, the struggles, just whatever the mundaneness,\nthe struggle of life are, a road trip is a kind of\nthing where you're like, \"You know what? I'm going to get away from it all, and I'm going to experience\nlife in the full, the epic sort of Jack Kerouac\nway of seeing America.\" The people, not the tourist\nsites, just the human-ness. - Yeah, exactly. This was not tourist related. We did, of course, one we stopped at Mount Rushmore at night, which you can see nothing. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - We thought that was hilarious. We couldn't see Mount Rushmore. - [Lex] That's great. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) - It was like, well, we\nphysically were here. We took a photo of us- - In the darkness. (Lex and Kimbal laughing) You can just say you went\nto the Grand Canyon too, just at night. - [Kimbal] Right. - And just visit different\nplaces when the car broke down. I love it. So yes, you took the road\ntrip before founding Zip2. - Yeah, so I had a experience in college running a house painting business. That for me was my first\nexperience with success. It was very, very hard. It was a franchise where\nthey teach students how to paint houses. But I was good at it. You know, I built a team of 30\npeople after about two years, and so I had a taste of, \"Hey, I'm not, I'm not unable to do this.\" In fact, my most vulnerable place I remember as an entrepreneur, was I just loved the idea\nof Wall Street and finance. I was kind of allured by it. This is in late 80s, I'm in high school, and there was a lot of these books, \"Liar's Poker\", and others that came out. And I was like, \"Ah, man, this is awesome. These people must be amazing.\" So I went to business school, and I busted my ass to get\nlike a kick-ass summer job. And I got a job in one of the main banks, and it was in Toronto, but it was like the original Wall Street. And I was so disappointed with the people that I was around. I was just like, \"Whoa.\" I totally misunderstood\nwhat the banking world is. It was a very large bank. I'm sure if I'd gone to\na more aggressive one, maybe I would've had a better experience. When I say aggressive, meaning\nsomeone was paying attention. Like this was just a... People kind of showing up\nand not doing much, you know? And anyway, actually, it was funny. So, this is great. So, 1991-'92, one of those summers. But the summer job was, literally, they print out the sales\nfor all brokerage houses, for the whole company. Pile of papers that's maybe\nfour or five feet tall. And you have a pencil, and you add things up using\nyour pencil and a calculator. And I had known about Lotus 1-2-3 forever. Excel was coming out, and I was like... \"Hey guys, you know that there's a different way to do this.\" (Lex and Kimbal laughing) And they're like, \"Don't\ntalk to us, just do your job. Go do it.\" - [Lex] Just use the pencil. - So I went to the head of the data, I just asked because,\nbecause in those days, you had the manila envelope, where you just write\nthe name of the person that you want this to go\nto, and it'll go to them. It's like email, I guess,\nbut there's no filter. - There's no spam filter. - There's no spam filter. So I sent a note, I wrote a nice letter to the database administrator,\nwho I didn't really know. And I said, \"Would you\nbe open to me saying hi, and maybe I can get access to the file, rather than print the thing\nout and use a pencil?\" And she responded right\naway, and we hit it off. I mean, she was great. And so she's like, \"Of\ncourse you can have it.\" I can't believe these guys\nare doing what they're doing. So, for the first couple\nof weeks of the summer, I wrote code in Lotus 1-2-3 that would... This is gonna sound crazy, but you type in the date range, you type in the geography, and you type in which part\nof the bank you care about, And it will literally just\ncreate a new spreadsheet, and the macro would print it out. It was like a magic trick for these guys. And... (Kimbal laughs) - Incredible. - I know, I know. It's sounding that... I mean, for me, I'm like,\n\"Guys, this is so obvious.\" (Lex and Kimbal laughing) So I got all that done, and this job was supposed to\ntake three or four months, because you're doing this with a pencil. And now I'd created this macro that you could not just do it, you could tweak it and say, oh, I want this area of\nthe world, or this month, or that month compared\nto that month, you know, all the normal things you\ncould do with a spreadsheet. And the software was on a floppy disk. And I was like, \"Here's the software, and just put it into your computer. Right, now open 1-2-3.\" And it just pops up with a little box, so type in your dates and you know, I coded a little thing like that. And... What I was astounded by was, not so much that they\nthought it was a magic trick, it was the lack of\nappreciation for innovation. They just looked at it and they were like, \"Huh, that's nice.\" And I was like, we're\ngonna have someone spend hundreds of hours doing something, and now it's something\nyou can do in a minute. - Yeah, if that doesn't\nfill you with excitement- - Yeah, like, if that\ndoesn't move your needle, what the heck? And so I was really disappointed\nwith the banking world. Anyway, but that was also fun- - Such a good example though. Yeah. And then also see the possibility of where that goes, you know? - But then I got back to business school, and I canceled all of my business\nclasses I possibly could. But I was actually in business school, so I couldn't cancel 'em all. All the finance courses, I was like, I'm done with that industry,\nI'm not going back. SO the vulnerable part for me was, my whole family's full of entrepreneurs, and there was this franchise\nto do house painting. And I genuinely was afraid\nthat I wouldn't be good at it. And I was like, \"Wow, I\nreally am afraid of failure.\" It's very easy to avoid entrepreneurship, but if your whole family's entrepreneurs, and you go in and you aren't good... I was really afraid. - You're gonna have to face that failure every time you meet your family. - Yes.\n(Lex laughs) Our family are wonderful and everything, but pretty much everyone's\nan entrepreneur. And of course, not everyone's perfect, not everyone's, you know, doing it successfully all the time. But when you're young, and\nyou wanna prove yourself, it really was putting\nmy heart on my sleeve. I started the business\nin this part of Toronto, and for the first... So you paint the houses in the summer, but you do all your sales\npre before the summer. You know, all the way till April, I was just not succeeding. And I was like, \"Oh my God, I'm just gonna fail.\" And I remember that, I was like... My whole nervous system\nwas like, \"I'm a failure.\" And I remember I had\nthis general manager who, you know, he was like, \"Kimbal, you seem like you\nknow what you're doing. Why are you not making any sales?\" And so he actually went with\nme on a few sales calls, and I was like... And he was like, \"Oh...\" He was great. \"You're doing this wrong,\nyou're doing that wrong, you're doing this wrong. And change those three things.\" And it was like a watershed moment. Just like all of a sudden... And I just followed the instructions of what this guy taught me. All of a sudden, every\nsingle sale I would make, I was like... I can't believe that I... It was really my lack of humility to learn from someone else. I was like, \"No, I'm gonna\nprove that I can do this without your teachings.\" And I was gonna fail. - So to you, that humility is essential for the entrepreneur, especially young. - I would say if we have\nan openness to learning, which does require humility. You help get other people\nto help you course correct. But it does start with humility. Because if you try and pretend\nyou have all the answers, you don't. - So you went from that to founding Zip2. That was an interesting\ntime in the history of tech. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - But I mean, what was it like you, you mentioned the first\npeople to look at a map, basically at directions. - Yeah, so, mapping had\nbeen on the internet, but vector-based mapping had not. So that's the ability\nto zoom in or zoom out. And it's really data versus\nan image that it comes across. And we went into this\ncompany called Navteq, my brother and I, and we\njust asked for the data. This is Silicon Valley. They wrote us a one page letter that we had to sign and said, \"Here's all of our data that\nwe own it, you don't own it, but you can use it on the internet, and if you ever make any money\non it, you have to call us.\" - [Lex] Mhm. (Lex laughs)\n- That was it. - [Lex] Yeah. - And we're like, \"Okay,\nthat sounds great.\" And so we put it up on the internet, and back in those days, it\nmight take 60 to 120 seconds to actually give you an answer back. But it was amazing. The door to door directions, the ability to take a map\nand zoom in and zoom out. We use these things 10 times a day now. It was amazing. And we were the first two humans\nto see it on the internet. Like, this stuff didn't\neven exist to the world. Like the Navteq was building\nit for Hertz NeverLost, which would come out a few years later. This was not something\nthat people knew existed. This was something we\ndiscovered that it existed. And we're like, \"Well,\nlet's put it on the internet and share it with the world.\" - What did the two of you feel like? Like, to see that magic? Did you know- - It was amazing. (Kimbal and Lex laughing) It was like, \"What?\" (Kimbal laughs) - Like, I mean, the amazing,\njust that it's cool, but also that you could see the future that this could transform... - I don't think people understand, before this moment, you could\nnot be told your directions. - [Le] Yeah. - You just could not. Like today, we live in this world where we're told our\ndirections all the time. Before this moment, you could\nnot be told your directions. - [Lex] Yeah. - And all of a sudden, you could. - [Lex] Yeah. - It wasn't like a little thing. - Yeah, there's a bunch of things that, once we have, we take it for granted. And that takes like a day for\npeople to like transition. - [Kimbal] Totally, one- - It like boom. \"Oh, okay, cool.\" - Yeah, exactly. Exactly. - And when you see, maybe when you're one of the\nfirst humans to see that thing, you're like, \"Holy shit.\" - \"Holy shit, this is going\nto be used by everyone, all the time, forever.\" - So, Zip2 was a success. - I would say it was a success, but it was also a very\nhard company to build. And I mean it because, the internet in those\ndays was a boom time. We were being funded, but\nyou couldn't make any money. And so it was actually really hard. The constant outside criticism\nthat we aren't for real, this is not gonna survive,\nthis is not gonna... And it started to feel that way. We're like, \"Wow, man, this is...\" We are doing something that is\ngreat that people are using. And we were a top 100 website. Most of our work was through\nfolks like the New York Times, so we were even much busier than that. But there was just no money in it. Even today, go to Google\nMaps, there's no money in it. It's just local search that\nis needed for everyone, and it became an add-on to search. But even remember in those days, you couldn't make money at search either. - [Lex] Mhm. - No one had figured\nout AdWords or anything. They didn't realize how\nbig of a business this was. But we all knew this was a thing, and everyone was using it. - But didn't quite know how\nto make money out of it. - Couldn't make money. When we got acquired, it\nwas a bittersweet moment, because Compact had owned AltaVista, wanted to merge that\nsort of regular search, which was the best search\nengine at the time, pre-Google, with Zip2, which would\nbe the best local search, and it would be a Yahoo killer. And Compact just wanted to make money by taking the company public, but they wouldn't give us any stock. They paid us cash, which turned out actually\nvery well for us, because the whole internet bubble burst. We didn't know that at the time. And so it was bittersweet, because they essentially\nwanted our company, and we were welcome to\nstay, but you don't have to. - [Lex] Right. - And that feeling... That was a pretty rough feeling. Yeah. - But in retrospect,\nit opened the door to- - It set us up for an incredible platform to go do beautiful things. - You've invested in X.com, that eventually merged with PayPal. That's a fascinating story there. Also fascinating on many levels, including the fact the\ncurrent social media company, formerly known as\nTwitter, is now called X. History has like a rhyme to it. Like it's kind of all hilarious\nin a certain kind of way. You invested in, and helped sell a lot of the initial products for Tesla. (Lex laughs) - Yeah, I still sit on the board of Tesla. Tesla is 20 years now. Isn't that amazing?\n- [Lex] 20 years. - Yeah. - From the Roadster,\nthe initial Roadster to- - I still have the first business plan. So I didn't join as a founder, I joined as a founding board member. And so I didn't write the\nbusiness plan, I got to read it. And I still have that, I still\nhave it as a part of history. - Did you see the future at that time? Like the company that Tesla is today, could you and Elon imagine it? - No, no. I certainly didn't. What I saw, and it was a real... For me personally, I was really upset that General Motors had\nkilled their EV car. There's even a movie called\n\"Who Killed the Electric Car?\" And I knew that the physics\nof electric is perfectly fine. I mean, there's no reason why you couldn't use a electric\ncar to drive around. What resonated with me\nwith the business plan was, take an electric motor, which is really a high performance motor, and put it in a sports car, and sell it at a high price as a way to enter into the market. Whereas what others had been doing, what at least General Motors had done is, you put it into a really crummy car, and you sell it as a commuter vehicle that doesn't really work that well. And looks ugly as well. Like they really did everything they could to make that thing as ugly as sin. And then I was like, \"Okay, I get it.\" We're gonna take an\nappropriate technology, and put it in an appropriate car, because electric motors,\nthey have constant torque, incredible power... Put it in a car that\nlooks like a sports car. You know, so the idea was to\nput it in the Lotus Elise, redesign it a bit. And even at that point, I was like, this is theoretically good,\nso I'm join and help build it, but I was not convinced\nthat it would work. Because General Motors had\ndone such a terrible job of making everyone think that\nthese things are terrible. But I was curious. And the time that I fell\nin love with the company and its mission was, I was driving in what's called a mule, where we take a car, and\nwe take the engine out, and we put put in electric drivetrain. And I drove it, you know, even the dashboards, there's no dashboard. It's just like you got a steering wheel, and it's just like wires\nand everything around. And I remember, there's a street\nwe were on in the Bay Area called Bing Street. And I was just like... No traffic. I was like, \"I'm just gonna\ndrive this, I'm gonna floor it. See what happens. And it was a feeling I'd\nnever experienced before. Gasoline cars have an inertia to them. So you... (Kimbal hums)\n- [Lex] Yeah. - This is just, was like\nbeing shot out of a cannon. And okay, this is gonna be real. - It's very spaceship like feeling. - Yeah. It's like, whoa. It's like G-force pulls you back. - [Lex] Yeah. - So I was like, \"Okay,\nthis is gonna be great. We're gonna create\nsomething interesting here.\" I think the real\ntransformative thing for Tesla was the Model 3. When we were able to get the\nprice down for the world. - And that was also one\nof the most challenging... - [Kimbal] Oh my God. - Periods of Tesla for you. - And do or die. I mean, we were borderline bankrupt like two or three times that year. I mean, and everyone was hating on us about whether we'd get that done. The Model 3 today is\nincredibly affordable car. Like a 300 bucks a month kind\nof lease, and $3,000 down. That's where you get the scale. That's where you get people who... And by the way, it's a great car. It's even a better Model 3 now\nthan it was five years ago. We don't function the way car\ncompanies function, right? We function more like how\nan iPhone company works, how Apple works. So our Model 3 today, this\nyear, is better than last year. It's like way better. And we just keep getting better. - And the software is a\nfundamental part of the car, and the software keeps improving. - Exactly. And we can upload over-the-air. - Which was one of the things that people don't often acknowledge. It's the over-the-air updates. It's like a revolutionary thing. - [Kimbal] Yes. - It's not just the autopilot. To me it's like the over-the-air updates is an even bigger thing than an autopilot, at least in this like moment of history. Because you basically turned\na car into the iPhone. - Exactly. It's an iPhone with wheels. But actually, talking about autopilot, like right after this interview, I'm gonna go test out the latest Model 3. - You're gonna get driven\naround by the robot. - I'm gonna get driven around by the car. I'm gonna say, \"I wanna\ngo to this barbecue joint. Take me there and park me there.\" And I'm gonna see how it is. And this is the latest Model 3 that we have out into production. Anyone can buy it. And it's super affordable. And it's like, okay... Full self-driving is a journey, right? It's not like there's a destination. It's a journey forever. So let's see where we\nare on the journey today. - And there's been a\nbit of a push and pull between you and Elon in\nterms of levels of optimism about deadlines and so on, timelines about when we'll\narrive at the destination. I like that you said it's a journey. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - For Elon there's a destination. - [Kimbal] Right, exactly. - And that destination is tomorrow. - [Kimbal] Yeah, right. (laughs) - Or yesterday. - That's a really good insight. I actually live with this\nconcept of a growth mindset versus a fixed mindset. And it's a, I don't know,\na philosophical term where, fixed mindset is about the destination, and a growth mindset is about\nlearning on the journey. And I think that I'm a happier person because I take that learning\non the journey approach. Whereas it's really frustrating if it has to be about the\ndestination every time. - The nice thing about destination, at least from my personal perspective as like a programmer, engineer is like, it puts a little fire\nunder you to get shit done. Like if there's a clear\ndeadline of a destination, you feel the anxiety of- - I would say that I still do that, but I call those forcing functions instead of destinations. - [Lex] Sure. - Because you're just forcing people to crank on on some code\nor cookbook or whatever, because you have a date. And oftentimes there's a reason, I mean, it's the 20th anniversary, you wanted to get the cookbook out. We have a reason, we didn't\nmake this up outta thin air. And so, yeah, that does push you. But just because we have the cookbook doesn't mean it's a destination. It means it was a forcing\nfunction to get it out there, now we're on the journey. - Speaking of journeys, I\nhave to ask you about SpaceX. I mean, the journey that\nall of humanity's on. - Seriously. There's a book about that\njourney, that is incredible. - It's an interesting moment\nin the history of humanity, that perhaps hopefully will\nbecome a multiplanetary species. But SpaceX is also a company. You invested in SpaceX, you\nwere side by side with Elon through the highs and the lows, through the lows and the highs. So, what were some memorable challenges? What were some low points? - [Kimbal] Sure. - From the history of SpaceX? - One of the hardest\ntimes in SpaceX was... We were in the mid Pacific in Kwajalein, and my brother had had sold PayPal. He'd done well financially,\nbut in the rocket world, that money goes away really quickly. And we were in this\nmilitary base in Kwajalein, and I think it was the\nsecond rocket that blew up, I'm not sure. But we didn't have infinite resources. I certainly didn't have the resources. I mean, I'm there to\nsupport, brotherly support. So every rocket launch was do or die. And the first one had blown up. And so the second one... I think it was the second one, blew up, and it was so depressing. It was just like, \"Ugh.\" There's nowhere to go,\nthere's no distraction. You're on this military base,\nyou don't really socialize. So it's just, we were all together, and I had gotten to know... You know, for me, I'm not\npart of the team, right? I'm just there for emotional\nsupport or whatever, 'cause it's cool. And so I got to know a\ncouple of people locally, and got to know this one\nguy who had a mobile home. Best view in the world,\nbut it's just a mobile home with a good patch of grass next to it. And I was just desperate to find food that wasn't from the cafeteria. 'Cause this is the worst\nfood you can imagine. - [Lex] Yeah. - And so I met him, and he showed me this tiny, little grocery store\nwhich had a few things like canned tomatoes and... Again, you're in the middle\nof nowhere, so nothing fresh. And I made this dish that\nwas kind of a version of a... Like an Italian version\nof chili, you know? Just baked beans, and sweating\nonions, and then tomatoes. And it was a big pot of food,\n'cause it's a group of people. We didn't even have a table. And we just put the big pot in the middle, and we had our little paper plates, and we took a scoop as we needed it. And it was... The gathering place of like, food brings people together\nin the most difficult times. And it was one of my favorite memories, because I was able to bring my gift to this group of incredible people, that their hearts were broken, you know? And to sit there and share a meal, and feel the life kind\nof come back into us. And by the end of the night, we're actually having a good time. - What a fascinating contrast of rockets, kind of representing\nthe peak accomplishment of human beings as a society, and then returning to the thing that is the foundation of human society, which is that communal experience. - A communal, vulnerable connection. Like we mentioned vulnerability earlier. The most vulnerable place, actually, that's when you have some of\nyour most beautiful meals. - Yeah. The descendants of apes gathering\naround some baked beans. - (laughs) Right. - After watching a rocket explode. - [Kimbal] Yeah. - What gives you hope about the future of this whole thing we've got going on? Humanity. - If you look at how things have changed over the past, say, 50 years, you can clearly say, \"Oh, wow.\" Poverty rates have gone down, infant mortality's gone down dramatically. All these things have gone down a lot. So if you look at it on a daily basis, you can tell that life is very dramatic. You know, whether it's\nsomething's blowing up on X, or from the newspapers or whatever. And you can really get caught up into it. But if you look back over\nthe past few decades, things are getting better. And I mean at the fundamental level, like are less people hungry? I mean, there is war going on, of course, but are there less wars? Yes. And so I think if we all just\nstep back a little bit... It's less about hope, it's more of perspective and reflection. And if I do see a problem, like in case of the obesity epidemic, I work really hard to help with that. Our nonprofit's called Big Green, and we work with 150\nnonprofits around the country to help Americans grow food again, get connected to their food. 'Cause I really believe\ngrowing food changes your life. And so okay, let's go do that. So I'll help out where I think we really can make a difference, but if you step back a little, things are actually getting better. It's just a bumpy ride. (Lex laughs) - Yeah, and for those of\nus watching all of this, I think I would love to see\nmore celebrating of the people that are helping. The people that have found\ntheir way of helping, and just celebrating those people. - Yeah. Well, I would also... Actually, that's a really nice point. I have learned that you really wanna celebrate your successes. Because even in the\ngreater scheme of things, I've learned this in the startup world, where you're constantly facing death. You know, like just why\nshould you even exist? Do your customers want your product? Or whatever. And then something will\nhappen where you're like, \"Wow, we really nailed that. That's really great.\" Or you got a product released, or got some good kudos from something. \"All right, everyone,\nwe're gonna go celebrate.\" And actually everyone's still like, \"No, no, we've got all\nthese other problems.\" \"Nope, we're gonna go celebrate, and then we'll go back to the problems.\" 'Cause if you don't do that, then it just starts\nbuilding on this kind of... You never really get to celebrate. - Mhm. And be grateful. Well, I think this is a\ngood time to go celebrate the very fact that we're alive today. We get to live and enjoy\nthis incredible life, the two of us, and have\nthis great conversation. And we'll get to celebrate\nover some scrambled eggs. - Beautiful. - [Lex] I'm gonna hold you to it. - Beautiful. - Kimbal, thank you so\nmuch for talking today. - Thank you for having me. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Kimbal Musk. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you some\nwords from Anthony Bourdain. \"Your body is not a temple,\nit's an amusement park. Enjoy the ride.\" Thank you for listening, and\nhope to see you next time."
