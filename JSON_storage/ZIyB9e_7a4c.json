The following is a conversation\nwith Andrew Huberman, his fifth time on the podcast. He is the host of the Huberman Lab Podcast and is an amazing scientist,\nteacher, human being, and someone I'm grateful to be able to call a close friend. Also, he has a book coming out next year that you should pre-order now called \"Protocols: An Operating\nManual for the Human Body.\" This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Huberman."

      "text": "You think there's ever gonna be a day when you walk away from podcasting? - Definitely. I mean, I came up within and then on the periphery\nof skateboard culture. And for the record, I was not a great skateboarder. I always have to say that 'cause skateboarders are relentless. If you call something you\ndidn't do or whatever, I mean, I could do a few things. And I loved the community and I still have a lot of\nfriends in that community. Jim Thiebaud at Deluxe, you can look them up. He's kind of the man\nbehind the whole scene. I know Tony, Hawk, Danny Whale, all these guys. I got to see them come up and get big and stay big. In many cases, start huge companies like\nDanny and Colin McKay are DC. Some people have a long life\nin something, some don't. But one thing I observed and learned a lot from skateboarding at the level of observing\nthe skateboarders and then the ones that started companies, and then what I also observed in science and still observe is\nyou do it for a while, you do it at the highest\npossible level for you. And then at some point, you pivot and you start supporting the young talent coming in. In fact, the greatest scientists, people like Richard Axel, Catherine Dulac, there are many other labs in neuroscience. Karl Deisseroth. They're not just known\nfor doing great science. They're known for mentoring some of the best scientists that then go on to start their own labs. And I think in podcasting, I am very fortunate I got\nin in a fairly early wave, not the earliest wave, but thanks to your suggestion of doing a podcast fairly early wave. And I'll continue to go\nas long as it feels right and I feel like I'm\ndoing good in the world and providing good, but I'm already starting to scout talent. My company that I started with Rob Moore, Scicomm Media. There's a couple other guys in there too. Mike Blabac, our photographer, Ian Mackey. Chris Ray, Martin Fobes. We are a company that\nproduces podcasts right now. That's Huberman Lab Podcast. But we're launching a new podcast, Perform with Dr. Andy Galpin. - [Lex] Nice. - And we wanna do more\nof that kind of thing, finding really great talent, highly qualified people,\ncredentialed people. And I've got a new kind of obsession with scouring the internet, looking for the young talent in science, in health and related fields. And so will there be a\nfinal episode of the HLP? Yeah, I mean, bullet buster cancer aside, someday they'll be the very last and thank you for your\ninterest in science, and I'll clip out. - Yeah. I love the idea of walking away and not be dramatic about it. When it feels right, you can leave and you can come back\nwhenever the fuck you want. - [Andrew] Right. - Jon Stewart did this\nwell with \"The Daily Show.\" I think that was during the 2016 election when everybody wanted him to stay on and he just walked away. Dave Chappelle, for different\nreasons, walked away. - Disappeared, came back. - Gave away so much money. Didn't care. And then came back and was doing standup in the park in the middle of nowhere. Genius. You have Habib who, undefeated, walks away at the very top of a sport. - Is he coming back? - No, he's done. - At least we don't know. Yeah. - Right, you don't know. I don't know if he knows. - It bears everywhere our word. (both laughing) - Yeah, I think it's always a call. The last few years have\nbeen tremendous growth. We launched in January 2021. And even this last year, 2024 has been huge growth\nin all sorts of ways. It's been wild. And we have some short\nform content planned, 30-minute shorter episodes that really distill down\nthe critical elements. We're also thinking about moving to other venues besides podcasting. So there's always the\nthought and the discussion, but when it comes to when\nto hang up your cleats, it's like there just comes a natural time where you can do more to mentor the next generation coming in, then focusing on self. And so there will come a time for that. And I think it's critical. I mean, again, I saw\nthis in skateboarding. Like Danny, and Colin, and Danny's brother Damon\nstarted DC with Ken Block, the driver who unfortunately passed away a little while ago, rally car driver. And they eventually sold it, I think to Quicksilver\nor something like that. But they're all phenomenal talents in their respective areas. But they brought in the\nnext line of amazing riders, the plan B thing, Paul Rodriguez. For skateboarders, they know who this is. Now, in science, there are scientists like\nFeynman, for instance. I don't know if anyone can name one of his mentor offspring. So there are scientists\nwho are phenomenal, like beyond world class, multi-generational world class who don't make good mentors. I'm not saying he wasn't good mentor, but that's not what he's known for. And then there are\nscientists who are known for being excellent\nscientists and great mentors. And I think there's no higher celebration to be had at the end of one's career. If you can look back and be like, \"Hey, I put some really\nimportant knowledge into the world. People made use of that knowledge.\" And guess what? You spawned all these\nother scientific offspring or sport offspring or podcast offspring. I mean, in some ways, we look to Rogan and to some of the other\nearlier podcasts is, like, they paved the way. Rhonda Patrick, First\nScience Podcast out there. Eventually, the baton passes. Fortunately, right now, everybody's active and\nit feels really good. Yeah, well, you're talking about the healthy way to do it, but there's also a different kind of way where you have somebody\nlike Grigori Perelman, the mathematician who refused\nto accept the Fields Medal. So he's one of the greatest\nliving mathematicians, and he just walked away from mathematics and rejected the Fields Medal. - What did he do after\nhe left Mathematics? - Life, private, 100%. - I respect that. - He's become essentially\nrecluse is these photos of him looking very broke. He could use the money. He turned away the money. He turned away everything. You just have to listen\nto the inner voice. You have to listen to yourself and make the decisions\nthat don't make any sense for the rest of the world\nand makes sense to you. - I mean, Bob Dylan didn't show up to pick up his Nobel Peace Prize. That's punk. - Yeah. - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - He probably grew in notoriety for that. Maybe he just doesn't\nlike going in Sweden, but seemed like it would be a fun trip. I think they do it in a nice time of year, but, hey, that's his right. He earned that right. - I think the best artists\naren't doing it for the prize. They aren't doing it for\nthe fame or the money. They're doing it because they love the art. - Yeah, that's the Rick Rubin thing. You gotta verb it through, download your inner thing. I don't think we've talked about this,"

      "section": "How to focus and think deeply",
      "text": "this obsession that I have\nabout how Rick has this way of being very, very still in his body, but keeping his mind\nvery active as a practice when spent some time with\nhim in Italy last June. And we would tread water\nin his pool in the morning and listen to history of rock\nand roll and a hundred songs. Amazing podcast, by the way. - It is. - Yeah. And then he would spend\na fair amount of time during the day in this\nkind of meditative state where his mind is very\nactive body, very still. And then Karl Deisseroth, when he came on my podcast, talked about how he forces\nhimself to sit still and think in complete\nsentences late at night after his kids go to sleep. And there's a state of mind, rapid eye movement sleep, where your body is completely paralyzed and the mind is extremely active. And people credit rapid eye movement sleep with some of the more\nelaborate emotion-filled dreams and the source of many ideas. And there are other examples. Einstein, people described\nhim as taking walks around the Princeton campus, then pausing and would\nask him what was going on and the idea that his mind was continuing to churn forward at a higher rate. So this is far from controlled studies, but we're talking about\nsome incredible minds and creatives who have a practice of stilling the body while keeping the mind\ndeliberately very active, very similar to rapid eye movement sleep. And then there are a lot of people who also report great ideas coming to them in the shower, while running. So it can be the opposite as well, where the body is very active and the mind is perhaps more on kind of like a default mode network, not really focusing on\nany one specific thing. - Interesting. There's a bunch of physicists and mathematicians I've talked to. They talk about sleep deprivation and going crazy hours through the night, obsessively pursuing a thing. And then the solution to the problem comes when they finally get rest. - We just did this\nsix-episode special series on sleep with Matt Walker. We know that when you\ndeprive yourself of sleep and then you get sleep, you get a rebound in\nrapid eye movement sleep, you get a higher percentage of rapid eye movement sleep. And Matt talks about this in the podcast,. And he did an episode\non sleep and creativity, sleep and memory, and rapid eye movement sleep\ncomes up multiple times in that series."

      "section": "Cannabis drama",
      "text": "There's also some very interesting stuff about cannabis withdrawal and rapid eye movement sleep. People are coming off\ncannabis often will suffer from insomnia, but when they finally do start sleeping, they dream like crazy. Cannabis is a very\ncontroversial topic right now. - Oh yeah, I saw that. What happened? There's a bunch of drama around episode you did on cannabis. - Yeah, we did a episode about cannabis, talked about the health benefits\nand the potential risks. It's neither here nor there. Depends on the person, depends on the age, depends on genetic background, a number of other things. We published that episode\nwell over a year ago and it had no issues online, so to speak. And then a clip of it was put to X where the real action occurs\nas your favorite spot. Yeah, the four ounce gloves as opposed to the 16 ounce gloves that is X versus Instagram or YouTube. There was kind of an immediate dog pile from a few people in the\ncannabis research field. - The PhDs and MDs, yeah. - There were people on our side. There were people not our side. I mean, the statement\nthat got things riled up the most was this notion that for certain individuals, there's a high potential\nfor inducing psychosis with high THC containing cannabis for certain individuals, not all. That sparked some issues. There was really a split. You see this in different fields. There was one person in particular who came out swinging with language that in my\nopinion is not like of the sort that you would use at a university venue, especially among colleagues. But that's fine. We're all grownups. - Well, for me, from my perspective, it was strangely rude. And it had an era of elitism that to me, was it the source of\nthe problem during COVID that led to the distrust of science and the popularization\nof disrespecting science because so many scientists\nspoke with an arrogance and a douchebag array that I wish we would have\na little bit less of? - Yeah, it's tough because most academics don't understand that people outside the\nuniversity system are... They're not familiar with\nthe inner workings of science and the culture. And so you have to be very careful how you present when you're\na university professor. So he came out swinging at a\nfour-letter word type language, and he was obviously upset about. So I simply said what\nI would say anywhere, which was, \"Hey, look,\ncome on the podcast. Let's chat And why don't you tell me where I'm wrong and let's discuss.\" And fortunately, he agreed. And initially, he said, \"Well, no, how can I be sure you're not gonna misrepresent me?\" We got on a DM, then an email, then eventually phone call and just said, \"Hey, listen, you're welcome to record the whole conversation. We've never done a gotcha on my podcast. Let's just get to the heart of the matter. I think this little\ncontroversy is perfect kindling for a really great discussion.\" And he had some other\nconditions that we worked out. And I felt like, cool. He's really interested, although you get a very different person on the phone than you do on Twitter. I will say he's been very collegial and that conversation is on the schedule. I said, \"We'll fly you out. We'll put you up.\" He said, no, he wants to fly himself. He really wants to make sure that there's kind of a\nspace between, I think, some of the perception of\nscience and health podcasts in the academic community\nis that it's all designed to sell something. No, we run ads, so it can be free to everyone else. Look, in the end, he agreed and I'm excited for the conversation. It was interesting because in the wake of\nthat little exchange, there's been a bunch of press from traditional press about cannabis has now surpassed alcohol in many cultures within\nthe United States as... When I say cultures, I mean, demographics. The United States as the drug of choice. There have been people\nhighlighting the issues of potential psychosis\nin high THC containing. And so it's kind of interesting to see how traditional media is sort of onboard certain elements\nthat I put forward. And I think there's some controversy as to whether or not\nthe different strains, the indicas and sativa are\nbiologically different, et cetera. So we'll get down into the weeds, pun intended, during that one. And I'm excited. It's the first time that we've responded to\na direct criticism online about scientific content in a way that really promoted like, oh, the idea of inviting\na particular guest. And so it's great. Let's get a guest who's\nexpert in cannabis. I believe, I could be wrong about this, but he's a behavioral neuroscientist at slightly different training. But look, he seems highly credentialed. It'd be fun. And we welcome that kind of exchange. I'm not being diplomatic. I'm just saying it's cool. He's coming on. - [Lex] No, you- - And he was friendly on the phone. He literally came out online and was basically kind of like FU, like F this and FU. But you get someone on the phone, it's like, \"Hey, how's it going?\" And they're like, \"Oh yeah, well...\" There was an immediate apology of like, \"Hey, listen, I came out. Normally, I'm not like that, but online....\" Yeah, you get a different. - Okay, listen. - It's a little bit like jujitsu, right? People say all sorts of things, I guess. But if you're like, \"All\nright, well, let's go,| then it's probably a different story. - It's not like jujitsu. 'cause in jujitsu, people don't talk shit 'cause they know what\nthe consequences are. Let me just say on mic and off mic, you have been very respectful\ntowards this person. And I look up to you and respect you and admire the fact that you have been. That said to me, that guy was being a dick. And when you graciously,\npolitely invited him on the podcast, he was still talking down\nto you the whole time, so I really admire and look forward to\nlistening to you talk to him, but I hope others don't do that. You are a positive, humble voice, exploring all the interesting\naspects of science. You want to learn. If you've got anything wrong, you wanna learn about it. The way he was being a dick, I was just hurt a little bit. Not because of him, but 'cause like there's some people I really, really admire, brilliant scientists that are not their best\nselves on Twitter, on X. - [Andrew] Definitely. - I don't understand what\nhappens to their brain. - Well, they regress. They regress. And they also are protected. I mean, no scientific\nargument should ever come to physical blows. But when you remove the real world thing of being right in front of somebody, people will throw all sorts\nof stones at a distance and over a wall. And they've got their\nwife, or their husband, or their boyfriend, or their dog, or their cat to go cuddle\nwith them afterwards. But you get in a room and it's like confrontational people in real life are pretty rare. Hopefully, if they do it, they're willing to back it up\nwith knowledge in this case. We're not talking about\nphysical altercation. He kept coming, and he kept putting on conditions. How do I know you want this? And I was like, \"Well, you\ncan record the conversation.\" \"How do I know you want that?\" \"Listen, we'll pay for you to come out.\" How do you know...\" And eventually, he just kind of relented. To his credit, he's agreed to come on. I mean, he still has to show up. But once he does, we'll treat him right, like we would any other guest. - Yeah, you treat people really well. I just hope that people\nare a little bit nicer on the internet. - Yeah. Well, X is an interesting one because it thickens your skin to just to go on there. I mean, you have to be ready to deal with- - Sure. But I can still criticize\npeople for being douchebags 'cause that's still not\ngood inspiring behavior. Especially for scientists, that should be sort of symbols\nof scientific thinking, which requires intellectual humility. Humility is a big part of that. And Twitter is a good\nplace to illustrate that. - Yeah. Years ago, I was a student in TA, then instructor, and then directed a cold\nspring harbor course on visual neuroscience. These are summer courses that explore different topics. And at night, we would host what we hoped were battles in front of the students where you'd get two people on... Would it be neural prosthetics or molecular tools that\nwould first restore vision to the blind kind of arguments? It's kind of a silly argument 'cause it's gonna be\na combination of both. But you'd get these great arguments, but the arguments were\nalways couched in data. And occasionally, you'd get\nsomebody would go, like, \"Argh!\" or would curse or something, but it was the rare, very well placed insult. It wasn't coming out swinging. I think ultimately Twitter's a record of people's behavior. The internet is a record\nof people's behavior. And here I'm not talking\nabout news reports about people's behavior. I'm talking about how\npeople show up online is really important. You've always carried yourself with a ton of composure and respect. You would hope that people\nwould grow from that example. Well, I'll tell you that the podcasters that I'm scouting, it's their energy, but it's also how they treat other people, how they respond to comments. We're blessed to have\npretty significant reach when we put out a podcast, of someone else's podcast, it goes far and wide. So like a skateboard team, like a laboratory where\nyou're selecting people to be in your lab, you want to pick people that you would enjoy working with and that are collegial. Etiquette is lacking nowadays, but you're in the suit and tie. You're bringing it back. - Bringing it back."

      "section": "Jungian shadow",
      "text": "- You said that your\nconversation with James Hollis, a Jungian psychoanalyst\nhad a big impact on you. What do you mean? - James Hollis is a 84-year-old\nJungian psychoanalyst who's written 17 books, including \"Under Saturn's Shadow,\" which is on the healing and trauma of men, the Eden Project, excuse me, which is about relationships\nand creating a life. I discovered James Hollis online lecture that was recorded I think in San Diego. It's on YouTube. The audio is terrible\ncalled \"Creating a Life.\" And this was somewhere\nin the 2011 to 2015 span. I can't remember. And I was on my way to Europe and I called my girlfriend at the time. I was like, \"I just found\nthe most incredible lecture I've ever heard.\" And he talks about the shadow. He talks about your\ndevelopmental upbringing and how you either align with or go 180 degrees off\nyour parents' tendencies and values in certain areas. He talked about the\nspecific questions to ask of oneself at different stages of life to live a full life. So it's always been a\ndream of mine to meet him and to record a podcast. And he wasn't able to travel. So our team went out to DC and sat down with him. We rarely do that nowadays. People come to our studio. And he came in. He had some surgeries recently and he kind of came in\nwith some assistance from a a cane and then sat down and just blew my mind. From start to finish, he didn't miss a syllable. And every sentence that he spoke was like a quotable sentence with real potency and actionable items. I think one of the things that was most striking\nto me was how he said, when we take ourselves out\nof stimulus and response, and we just force ourselves to spend some time in\nthe quiet of our thoughts while walking or while\nseated or while lying down. Doesn't have to be meditation, but it could be that we\naccess our unconscious mind in ways that reveals to us who we really are and what we really want. And that if we do that\npractice repeatedly, 10 minutes a day here, 15 minutes a day there, that we start to really\ntouch into our unique gifts and the things that make us each us and the directions we need to take. But that so often we just\nstay in stimulus response. We just do, do, do, do do, which is great. We have to be productive, but we miss those important messages. And interestingly, he also\nput forward this idea of... What is this? It's like get up, shut up, suit up. Yeah, something like that. Get out of bed, suit up, and shut up, and get to work. He also has that in him, kind of a Goggins type mindset. - So be able to turn off\nall this self-reflection and self-analysis and just get shit done. - Get shit done. But then also dedicate time and stop and just let stuff geyser to the surface from the unconscious mind. And he quotes Shakespeare, and he quotes Jungian. And he quotes everybody through history with incredible accuracy and, and exactly the way needed\nto drive home a point. That conversation to me was one that I really felt like, okay, if I don't wake up tomorrow for whatever reason, that one's in the can. And I feel really great about it. To me, it's the most\nimportant guest recording we've ever done in particular because he has wisdom. And while I hope he lives to be 204, chances are, he's got\nanother 20, 30 years with us, hopefully more. But I really, really wanted\nto capture that information and get it out there. So I'm very, very proud of that one. And he's the kind of guy that anyone listens to him, young, old male, female, whatever. And you're gonna get something of value. What do you think about this idea of the shadow that the good and the bad that we repress, that hides from plain sight when we analyze ourselves, that's there? You think there's like a ocean that we we don't have direct access to? - Yes. Yeah, Jungian said it. We have all things inside of us and we do. And some people are more in touch with those than others. And some people, it's repressed. I mean, does that mean that we could all be horrible people or marvelous people, benevolent people? Perhaps. Thankfully, more often than not, people lean away from the violent and harmful parts of their shadow. But I think spending time thinking about one's shadows is super important. How else are we going to grow? Otherwise, we have these\nunconscious blind spots of denial or repression or whatever the psychiatrists tell us. But yeah, it clearly\nexists within all of us. I mean, we have neural circuits for rage. We all do. We have neural circuits for altruism and no one's born without these things. And some people, they're atrophied. And some people, they're hypertrophied. But looking inward and\nrecognizing what's there is key. - Or positive things like creativity. Maybe that's what Rick Rubin is accessing. When you go silent body, active mind, that's interesting. What is it for you? What place do you go to\nthat generates ideas, that helps you generate ideas? - I have a lot of new\npractices around this. I mean, I'm always\nexploring for protocols. I have to. It's in my nature. When I went and spent time with Rick, I tried to adopt his practice\nof staying very still and just letting stuff come to the surface or Deisserothian way of\nformulating complete sentences while being still in the body. What I have found works better is what my good friend Tim\nArmstrong does to write music. He writes music every day. He's a music producer. He is obviously a singer/guitar\nplayer for Rancid. And he's helped dozens and dozens and dozens of female pop artists and punk rock artists write great songs. And many of the famous songs that you've heard from other artists, Tim helped them write. Tim wakes up sometimes in\nthe middle of the night. And what he does is he'll\nstart drawing or painting. So what he's done, and Joni Mitchell talks about this too, you find some creative outlet that's like 15 degrees off center from your main creative outlet and you do that thing. So for me, that's drawing. I like doing anatomical drawings, neuroscience-based\ndrawing, drawing neurons, that kind of thing. And if I do that for a little while, my mind starts churning on the\nnervous system and biology. And then I come up with\nareas I'd like to explore for the podcast, ways I'd like to address certain topics. Right now, I'm very interested\nin autonomic control. A beautiful paper came out that shows that anyone can learn to\ncontrol their pupil sizes and without changing luminance through a biofeedback mechanism. And that gives them auto control over their so-called automatic\nautonomic nervous system. And I've been looking\nat what the circuitry is and it's beautiful. So I'll draw the circuitry that we know underlies autonomic function. And as I'm doing that, I'm thinking, oh, like what\nabout autonomic control and those people that\nsupposedly can control their pupil size? Then you go in and there's a paper\npublished in Nature Press, one of the Nature journals. And there's a recent paper on this. Like, oh cool. And then we talk about this. And then how could this be\nput into a kind of a post? So doing things that are\nabout 15 degrees off center from your main thing is\na great way to access. I believe that the circuits\nfor, in Tim's case, painting goes to songwriting. I think for Joni Mitchell, that was also the case. I think it was drawing and painting to singing and songwriting. For Rick, I don't know what it is. Maybe it's listening to podcasts. I don't know. That's his business. Do you have anything that you like to focus on that allows you\nthen an easier transition into your main creative work? - No, I really like to focus\non emptiness and silence. So I pick the dragon I have to slay, so whatever the problem I have to work on and I just sit there and stare at it. - I love how fucking linear you are. - And if there's no, if you're tired, I'll just sit. I believe in the power of just waiting. And usually, I'll stop being tired or energy rises from somewhere or an idea pops from somewhere, but there needs to be a\nsilence and an emptiness. It's an empty room, just me and the dragon and we wait. That's it. Usually with programming, you're thinking about a particular design. How do I design this thing\nto solve this problem? - Any cognitive enhancers? I've got a quite the\ngallery in front of me. - Oh that's right, yeah. - Should we walk through this? - Yeah. - This is not a a sales thing, It's just I tend to do\nthis bounce back and forth. Your refrigerator just happened to have a lot of different choices. So water. - This is all my refrigerator. - I know, right? There's no food in there. There's water. There's Element which\nthey now have canned. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - And yes, they're a podcast\nsponsor for both of us, but that's not why I\ncracked one of these open. I like them provided they're cold. - And that's, by the way,\nmy least favorite flavor as I was saying. That's the reason it's\nstill left in the fridge. - The cherry one is really good. - The black cherry. There's orange one. - Yeah. I pushed the sled this morning and pulled the sled for\nmy workout at the gym. And it was hot today here in Austin, so some salt is good. And then Mateína Yerba Mate,\nzero sugar, full confession. I helped develop this. I'm a partial owner, but I love yerba mate. Half Argentine. Been drinking mate since\nI was a little kid. There's actually a photo\nsomewhere on the internet when I'm like three, sitting on my grandfather's lap, sipping mate out the gourd. And then this you might find interesting, this is just a little bit\nof coffee with a scoop of... Brian Johnson gave me cocoa, just like pure unsweetened cocoa. So I put that in chocolate. I like it,. - Just for the taste. - Well, actually, nukes my appetite. And since we're not going out to dinner tonight until later, I figure that's good."

So now he's injecting BPC\nbody protection compound 157, which many, many people\nare taking, by the way, I did an episode on peptides. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - I should just say BPC 157, one of the known effects in animal models is angiogenesis, like development of new vasculature, which can be great in some context, but also if you have a tumor, you don't really want to vascularize that tumor anymore. So I worry about people\ntaking BPC 157 continually. And there's very little human data. I think there's like one study and it's a lousy one. It's a lot of animal data. Some of the peptides are interesting. However, there's one that\nI've experimented with a little bit called Pinealon, which I find even if I've\njust taken it twice a week before sleep, then it seems to do something to the circadian timekeeping mechanism because then on other\ndays when I don't take it, I get unbelievably tired at that time that normally I would do the injection. These are things that I'll experiment with for a couple weeks\nand then typically stop, maybe try something else. But I stay out of things\nthat really stimulate any of like major hormone pathways when it comes to peptides. - That's actually a really good question of how do you experiment? How long do you try a thing to figure out if it works for you? - Well, I'm very\nsensitive to these things, and I have been doing a lot\nof things for a long time. So if I add something in, it's always one thing at a time, and I notice right away if it does not make me feel good. There's a lot of excitement about some of the so-called growth\nhormone secretagogues, ipamorelin, tesamorelin, and sermorelin. And I've experimented a little bit with those in the past and they've nuked to my\nrapid eye movement sleep. But given me a lot of deep sleep, which doesn't feel good to me, but other people like them. I also just generally try and avoid taking peptides that tap into these hormone pathways because you can run into\nall sorts of issues, but some people take them safely. But usually after about four or five days, I know if I like something or I don't and then I move on. But I am not super\nadventurous with these things. I know people that will\ntake cocktails of peptides with multiple things. They'll try anything. That's not me. And I do blood work,. But also I'm mainly reading\npapers and podcasting. And I'm teaching a course\nnext spring, Stanford. I'm gonna do a big undergraduate course. So I'm trying to develop that course and things like that. So I don't need to lift more weight or run further than I already do, which is not that much\nweight or far as it is. - Right. You're not going to Olympics. You're not trying to\ntruly maximize some aspect of your performance. - No. And I'm not trying to\nget down below, whatever, 7% body fat or something. I don't have those kinds of goals. So hydration, electrolytes, caffeine in the form of mate and then this coffee thing. And then here's one that, I think, I brought out for discussion. This is a piece of Nicorette. They're not a sponsor."

      "section": "Nicotine",
      "text": "Nicotine is an interesting compound. It will raise blood pressure, and it is probably not safe for everybody. But the nicotine is gaining\nin popularity like crazy. Mainly, these pouches that\npeople put in the lip,. We're not talking about\nsmoking vaping, dipping, or snuffing. My interest in nicotine started, this was in 2010, I was visiting Columbia Medical School, and I was in the office of the great neurobiologist, Richard Axel, won the Nobel Prize, co-recipient with Linda\nBuck for the discovery of the molecular basis of olfaction. Brilliant guy. He's probably in his late\nseventies now, probably. Yeah. And he kept popping Nicorette in his mouth and I was like, \"What's this about?\" And he said, \"Oh well,\nthis was just anecdote.\" But he said this, he said, \"Oh well, it\nprotects against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.\" I said, \"It does/?\" And he goes, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\" I don't know if he was kidding or not. He's known for making jokes. And then he said that\nwhen he used to smoke, it really helped his focus in creativity. But then he quit smoking 'cause he didn't want lung cancer and he found that he\ncouldn't focus as well, so he would choose Nicorette. So occasionally, right now, I do a half a piece, but I'm not Russian so I'm a little... You did just pop the\nwhole thing in your mouth. - Mm-hmm. - So I'll do a couple\nmilligrams every now and again. And it definitely sharpens the mind on an empty stomach in particular. But you fast all day, you're still doing one meal a day, - One meal a day. - Yeah. - Yeah, I did a nicotine\npouch with Rogan at dinner and I got high. - Yeah, that's a lot. That's usually six or eight milligrams. I know people that get a canister of Zin, take one a day, pretty soon they're\ntaking a canister a day. So you have to be very careful. I will only allow myself two pieces of Nicorette total per week. And you will notice that in the day after you use it, sometimes your throat\nwill feel a little bit like a little spasm, like you might want to\ncough once or twice. And so if you're a singer or you're a podcaster or something, you have to do long podcast, you wanna just be mindful of it. But yeah, you're supposed\nto kind of like keep it in your cheek and here we go. - But it did make me intensely focus in a way that was a\nlittle bit scary 'cause... - The nucleus basalis is\nin the in basal forebrain. Nucleus has cholinergic neurons that radiate out axons, little wires that release acetylcholine into the neocortex and elsewhere. And when you focus on one\nparticular topic matter or one particular area\nof your visual field or listening to something\nand focusing visually, we know that there's an\nelaboration of the amount of acetylcholine released there, and it binds to nicotinic acetylcholine\nreceptor sites there. So it's a kind of an\nintentional modulation by acetylcholine. With nicotine, you're getting exogenous or artificial heightening\nof that circuitry. - And the time I had Tucker\nCarlson on the podcast, he told me that apparently, it helps him, as he said publicly, keep his love life vibrant. - Really? It causes vasoconstriction. - Well, he literally said it\nmakes his dick really hard. He said that publicly also. - Okay, well, as little as I want to think about Tucker Carlson's- - Trust me. - Sex life, no disrespect. The major effect of nicotine\non the vasculature., my understanding is that\nit causes vasoconstriction, not vasodilation. Drugs like Cialis,\nTadalafil, Viagra, et cetera, vasodilators, they allow more blood flow. Nicotine does the opposite, less blood flow to the periphery. But provided dosages are kept low... I don't recommend people\nuse it frequently or at all. And I don't recommend young people use it, 25 and younger. Brain's very plastic at that time. And certainly smoking,\ndipping, vaping aren't good because we run into\ntrouble for other reasons. But in any case, and even there, vaping is a controversial topic. Probably safer than smoking, but has its own issues. I said something like that and boy did I catch a\nlot of heat for that. You can't say anything as\na health science educator and not piss somebody off. It just depends on where\nthe center of masses and how far outside that you are."

      "text": "For me, the caffeine is the main thing. And actually, it's a\nreally big part of my life. And one of the things you recommend that people wait a bit in the morning to consume caffeine. - If they experience a\ncrash in the afternoon, that this is one of the\nmisconceptions I regret maybe even discussing it, for people that crash in the afternoon, oftentimes if they delay their caffeine by 60 and 90 minutes in the morning, they will offset some of that. But if you eat a lunch that's too big or you didn't sleep well the night before, you're not gonna avoid\nthat afternoon crash. But I'll wake up sometimes and go straight to hydration, caffeine, especially if I'm gonna workout. Here's a weird one. If I exercise before 8:30 AM, especially if I start exercising when I'm a little bit tired, I get energy that lasts all day. If I wait until my peak of energy, which is mid-morning, 10:00 AM 11:00 AM and I start exercising then, I'm basically exhausted all afternoon. And I don't understand why. I mean, it depends on the\nintensity of the workout, but I like to be done showered and heading into work by 9:00 AM, but I don't always meet that mark. - So you're saying it\ndoesn't affect your energy if you start out with exercising? - I think you can get energy and wake yourself up with\nexercise if you start early, and then that fuels you all day long. I think that if you wait until you're feeling\nat your best to train, sometimes that's detrimental because then in the afternoon when you're doing the\nwork we get paid for, like research, podcasting, et cetera, then oftentimes your brain\nisn't firing as well. - That's interesting. I haven't really rigorously tried that, wake up and just start running or listen. - This is the Jocko thing."

      "text": "And then there's this\nphenomenon called entrainment where if you force yourself to exercise, or eat, or socialize, or view bright light at\na certain time of day for three to seven days in a row, pretty soon there's an\nanticipatory circuit that gets generated. This is why anyone in theory\ncan become a morning person to some degree or another. And this is also a beautiful example of why you wake up before your alarm clock goes off. People wake up and all of a sudden it goes off. It wasn't 'cause it clicked. It's because you have this incredible timekeeping mechanism that exists in sleep. And there's some papers\nthat have been published in the last couple of years, Nature Neuroscience and elsewhere showing that people can answer math\nproblems in their sleep, simple math problems, but math problems nonetheless. This does not mean that if you ask your partner a question in sleep that they're\ngonna answer accurately,. - They might screw up the\nwhole cumulative probability of 20% across multiple months. - All right, listen. - What happened? - What happened? Here's the deal. A few years back, I did a four and a half\nhour after editing, four and a half hour episode on male and female fertility. The entire recording took 11 hours. And by the way, I'm very\nproud of that episode. Many couples have written to me and said they now have children as a consequence of that episode. And my first question is, what were you doing during the episode? But in all seriousness- - We should say that it's\nfour and a half hours. - [Andrew] Yeah. - And they should listen to the episode. It's extremely technical episode. You're nonstop dropping facts and referencing huge number of papers,. It must be exhausting. I don't understand how you can possibly- - It talk about sperm\nhealth, spermatogenesis. It talks about the ovulatory cycle. It talks about things people can do that are considered absolutely\nsupported by science. It talks about some of the things kind of out on the edge a little bit that are a little bit more experimental. It talks about IVF. It talks about ICSI. It talks about all of that. It talks about frequency of pregnancy as a function of age, et cetera. But there's this one\nportion there in the podcast where I'm talking about the probability of a successful pregnancy\nas a function of age. And so there was a clip that was cut in which I was describing\ncumulative probability. And by the way, we've published cumulative probability histograms in many of my laboratories, papers, including one that was in\nNature article in 2018. So we run these all the time. And yes, I know the\ndifference between independent and cumulative probability, just like I do. The way the clip was cut and what I stated unfortunately combined to a pretty great gaff where I said, you're just\nadding percentages to 120%. Unfortunately, my humor\nisn't always so good. And I made a joke. I said, \"120%, but that's a\ndifferent thing altogether.\" What I should have said\nwas, that's impossible and here's how it actually works. But then it continues where I then describe the\ncumulative probability histogram for successful pregnancy. But somewhere in the early portion, I misstated something. I made a math error, which implied I didn't\nunderstand the difference between independent and\ncumulative probability, which I do. And it got picked up and run. And people had a really good laugh with that one at my expense. And so what I did in response to it was rather than just say\neverything I just said now, I just came out online and said, \"Hey, folks, in an episode\ndated this on fertility, I made a math error. Here's the formula for\ncumulative probability, successful pregnancy at that age. Here's the graph.\" I offered it as a teaching\nmoment in two ways. One, for people to understand\ncumulative probability. It was sort of interesting too, a number of people that had come out critiquing the GAF. Like Balaji and folks came out, pointing out that they didn't understand cumulative probability. So there was a lot of posturing. The dog pile, oftentimes, people are quick to dog pile. They didn't understand. But a lot of people did understand, some smart people out there, obviously. I called my dad and he was just laughing. He goes, \"Oh, this is good. This is like the old school way of hammering academics.\" But the point being, it was a teaching moment, given me an opportunity to\nsay, \"Hey, I made a mistake.\" I also made a mistake in another podcast where I did a micron to\nmillimeter conversion or centimeter conversion. And we always correct these\nin the show note captions. We correct them in the audio now. Unfortunately, on YouTube, it's harder to correct. You can't go and edit in segments. We put in the captions. But that was the one teaching moment. If you make a mistake, it's substantive and relate to data, you apologize and correct a mistake, use a teaching moment. The other one was to say, hey, in all the thousands of hours of content we've put out, I'm sure I've made some small errors. I think I once said serotonin\nwhen I meant dopamine. You're going, you're riffing. And it's a reminder to be\ncareful to edit, double check. But the internet usually edits for us and then we go make corrections. But it didn't feel good at first. But ultimately, I can\nlaugh at myself about it. Long ago at Berkeley, when I was TAing my first class, it was a biopsychology\nclass between 1998 or 1999, I was drawing the pituitary gland, which has anterior and a posterior lobe, actually as a medial lobe too. I probably have 5, 600\nstudents in that lecture hall. It was chalkboard and I drew the two lobes of the pituitary. My back was to the audience. I said, \"And so they\njust sort of hang there.\" And everyone just erupted in laughter 'cause it looked like a\nscrotum with two testicles. And I remember thinking like, \"Oh my God, I don't\nthink I can turn around, I can face this.\" Oh, gotta turn around sooner or later. So I turned around and we just all had a big laugh together 'cause it was embarrassing. I'll tell you one thing, though, they never forgot about the\ntwo lobes of the pituitary. - Yeah. And you haven't forgotten\nabout that either. - Right. There's a high salience\nfor these kinds of things. And it also was kind of fun to see how excited people\nget to see people trip. It's like an elite sprinter trips and does something stupid, like runs the opposite\ndirection out the blocks or something like that. I recall one World Cup match years ago, a guy scored against his own team. I think they killed the guy. Do you remember that? - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - Some South American or\nCentral American team. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - And they killed the guy. But yeah, let's look it up. I just said World Cup. Yeah, he was gunned down - Andres Escobar scored\nagainst his own team in 1994 World Cup in the United States, just 27 years old, playing for the Columbia National team. - Yeah. Last name, Escobar. That's a good name. - I think it would protect you. - Listen, so there's some gaffes that get people killed. So how forgiving are\nwe for online mistakes? It's the nature of the mistakes. People were quite gracious about the gaff and some weren't. And it's interesting that we as public health\nscience educators, we'll do long podcasts sometimes and you need to be really careful. What's great is AI allows you to check these things now more readily. So that's cool. And there are ways that it's now gonna be\nmore self-correcting. I think there's a lot of errors out there on the internet and people are finding them and it's cool. Things are getting cleaned up. - Yeah. But mistakes nevertheless will happen. Do you feel the pressure\nof not making mistakes? - Sure. I mean, I try and get things right to the best of my ability. I check with experts. It's kind of interesting when people really don't like something that was said in a podcast. A lot of times, I chuckle 'cause... At Stanford, we have\nsome amazing scientists, but I talk to them, people elsewhere. And it's always interesting to me how I'll get divergent information and then I'll find the\noverlap in the Venn diagram. And I have this question, do I just stay with the\noverlap in the Venn diagram? I did an episode on oral health. I didn't know this until\nI researched that episode, but oral health is critically related to heart health and brain health. That there's a bacteria that causes cavities streptococcus that can make its way into\nother parts of the body through the mouth that\ncan cause serious issues. There's the idea that\nsome forms of dementia, some forms of heart disease\nstart in the mouth, basically. I talked to no fewer than\nfour dentists, dental experts and there was a lot of convergence. I also learned that\nteeth can demineralize, that's the formation of cavities. They can also remineralize. As long as a cavity isn't too deep, it can actually fill itself back in, especially if you provide\nthe right substrates for it. That saliva is this incredible fluid that has all this capacity to remineralize teeth\nprovided the milieu is right. Things like alcohol-based\nmouth wash is killing off some of the critical things you need. It's fascinating. And I put out that episode thinking, oh, well, I'm not a dentist, I'm not an oral health episode, but I talked to a pediatric dentist. There's a terrific one, doctor_staci, S-T-A-C-I, on Instagram, does great content. Talked to some others. And then I just waited for the attack. I was like, \"Here we go,\" and it didn't come. And dentists were thanking me. I was like, \"Whoa.\" - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - That's a rare thing. More often than not, if I do an episode about, say, psilocybin or MDMA, you get some people liking it, or ADHD and the drugs for ADHD. We did a whole episode\non the Ritalin, Vyvanse, Adderall stuff. You get people saying, \"Thank you, I prescribed this to my kid and it really helps,\" but they're private about\nthe fact that they do it because they catch so much\nattack from other people. So I like to find the\ncenter of mass report that, try and make it as clear as possible. And then I know that there's some stuff where I'm gonna catch. What's frustrating for\nme is when I see claims that I'm like against\nfluoridization of water, which I'm not. We talked about the benefits of fluoride. It builds hyper strong\nbonds within the teeth. I went and looked at some of\nliterally the crystal sruc... Excuse me, not the crystal structure, but essentially like micron and sub-micron structure\nof teeth is incredible and where fluoride can get in there and form these super strong bonds. And you can also form them with\nthings like hydroxyapatite. And why is there fluoride in water? Well, it's the best. Okay. You say some things that are interesting, but then somehow it gets turned into like you're against fluoridization, which I'm not, or I've been accused of\nbeing against sunscreen. I wear mineral-based sunscreen on my face. I don't want to get skin cancer, or I use a physical barrier. There is a cohort of\npeople out there that think that all sunscreens are bad. I'm not one of them. I'm not what's called a sunscreen truther. But then you get attacked\nfor like if you... So we're talking about\nthere are certain sunscreens that are problematic. And Rhonda Patrick's now starting to get vocal about this. And so there's certain\ntopics, it's interesting, for which you have to listen carefully to what somebody is saying, but there's a lumper or lumping as opposed to splitting of what health educators say. With politics, there's this urgency to just put people into a camp of expert versus\nrenegade or something. And it's not like that. It's just not like that. So the short answer is I really strive, really strive to get things right, but I know that I'm gonna\npiss certain people off. And you've taught me and Joe's taught me and other\npodcasters have taught me that if you worry too much about it, then you aren't gonna get the\nnewest information out there. Like peptides, there's\nvery little human data, unless you're talking\nabout Vyleesi or the stuff in the alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating\nhormone stuff which are prescribed for female libido to enhance female libido or Sermorelin, which is for certain growth\nhormone deficiencies. With rare exception, there's very little human data, but people are still super interested in, a lot of people are taking\nand doing these things, so you wanna get the information out. - Do you try to not just\nlook at the science, but research what the various\ncommunities are talking about, like maybe research the conspiracy theorists\nare talking about, just so you know all the armies that are going to be\nattacking your castle? - Yes. So like for instance, there's a community of\npeople online that believe that if you consume seed oils or something that setting\nup your skin for sunburn and if you don't. There's all these theories. So I like to know what the theories are. I like to know what the extremes are, but I also like to know what\nthe standard conversation is. But there's generally more\nagreement than disagreement. I think where I've been kind of bullish actually are supplements. People go, \"Oh supplements.\" Well, there's food supplements\nlike a protein powder, which is different than a vitamin. And then they are compounds. There are compounds\nthat have real benefit, but people get very nervous about the fact that they're not regulated. But some of them are\nvetted with for potency and for safety with\nmore rigor than others. And it's interesting to see how people who take care of themselves and put a lot of work into\nthat are often attacked. That's been interesting. Also, one of the most controversial topics nowadays is Ozempic, Mounjaro. I'm very middle of the road on this. I don't understand why the quote, unquote, \"health wellness community\"\nis so against these things. I also don't understand why they have to be looked at as the only route. For some people, they've really helped them lose weight. And yes, there can be some muscle loss and other lean body loss, but that can be offset\nwith resistance training. They've helped a lot of people. And other people are like, \"No, this stuff is terrible.\" I think the most interesting\nthing about Ozempic, Mounjaro is that they're\nin the GLP-1 pathway, glucagon-like peptide 1. And it was discovered in Gila monsters, which is a lizard, basically. Now, the entomologist will dive on me. It's a big lizard-looking thing that doesn't eat very often. And they figured out\nthat there's this peptide that allows it to curb its own appetite at the level of the brain and the gut. And it has a lot of homology to sequence hemology to\nwhat we now call GLP-1. So I love anytime there's\nanimal biology links to cool human biology links to a drug that's powerful that can help people with\nobesity and type 2 diabetes. And there's evidence that can\neven curb some addictions. Those are newer data. But I don't see as either or. In fact, I've been a little\nbit disappointed at the way that the, whatever you wanna\ncall it, health wellness, biohacking community has\nslammed on Ozempic, Mounjaro. They're like, \"Just get out and run.\" Listen, there are people who are carrying substantial amounts of weight that running could injure them. They get on these drugs\nand they can improve. Hopefully, they're also\ndoing resistance training and eating better, and then you're bringing\nall the elements together. - Well, why do you think\nthe criticism is happening? Is it that Ozempic became super popular so people are misusing\nit or that kind of thing? - No, I think what it\nis, is that people think if it's a pharmaceutical, it's bad. - Yeah. - Or if it's a supplement, it's bad depending on\nwhich camp they're in. And wouldn't it be wonderful to kind of fill in the\ngap between this divide? What I would like to see in politics and in health is neither right nor left, but what we can just call a\nleague of reasonable people that looks at things on\nan issue by issue basis and fills in the center 'cause I think most people are in the, I don't wanna say, center in a political way, but I think most people are reasonable. They want to be reasonable, but that's not what sells clicks. That's not what drives interest. I look at issue by\nissue, person by person. I don't like ingroup,\noutgroup stuff I never have. I've got friends from all walks of life. I said this on other podcasts and it always sounds like\na political statement. The push towards polarization,"

      "text": "it's so frustrating. If there's one thing that's discouraging to me as I get older each year, I'm like, \"Wow, are we ever gonna get out of this polarization?\" Speaking of which, how are you gonna vote for\nthe presidential election? - I'm still trying to figure out how to interview the people\ninvolved and do it well. - What do you think the role of podcast is gonna be\nin this year's election? I would love long form conversations to happen with the candidates. I think it's gonna be huge. I would love Trump to go on Rogan. I'm embarrassed to say this, but I honestly would love to see Joe Biden go on Joe Rogan also. - I would imagine that both would go on, but separately. - Separately is, I think, a debate. Joe does debates, but I think Joe at his best, this one-on-one conversation\nreally intimate. I just wish that Joe Biden would actually\ndo long form conversations. - I thought he had done a... wasn't he? I think it was on Jay Shetty's podcast. - He did Jay Shetty. He did a few. But when I mean long form, I mean really long form, like two, three hours and more relaxed, it was much more orchestrated. Because what happens when the interview's a\nlittle bit too short, it becomes into this\ngeneric political type of NBC, CNN type of interview. You get a set of questions and you don't get to\nreally feel the human, expose the human to the light in... The full, we talked about the shadow, the good, the bad, and the ugly. So I think there's something magical about two, three, four hours. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - But it doesn't have to be that long. But it has to have that feeling to it where there's not people standing around and everybody's nervous, and you're going to be strictly sticking to the question answer type of feel, but just shooting shit, which Rogan is the best by\nfar in the world at that. - I don't think people really appreciate how skilled he is at what he does. I mean, the three or\nfour podcasts per week plus the UFC announcing, plus\ncomedy tours, and stadiums, plus doing comedy shows\nin the middle of the week, plus a husband, and a father,\nand a friend, and jujitsu, the guy's got like\nsuperhuman levels of output. I agree that long form conversation is a whole other business. And I think that people want and deserve to know the\npeople that are running for office in a different way and to really get to know them. Well, listen, I guess you... I mean, is it clear that\nhe's gonna do jail time or maybe he gets away with fine? - No, I don't think I'm- - 'Cause I was gonna say, I mean, does that mean\nyou're gonna be podcasting from jail?\n- In prison, yeah. In fact, I'm going to figure out how to commit a crime so I can get in prison with- - Please don't, please don't. I'm sure they have visitors. - Right. - That just doesn't feel an authentic way to get the interview. But yeah, I understand. - You wouldn't be able to wear that suit. You'd be wearing a different suit. - That's true. - Yeah.\n- That's true. - It's gonna be interesting. I'm not just saying this 'cause you're my friend, but you would do a marvelous job. I think you should sit down with all of them separately to keep it civil and see what happens. Here's one thing that I found really interesting in this whole political landscape. When I'm in Los Angeles, I often get invited to these... They're not dinners, but gatherings where a local bunch of podcasters will come together, but a lot of people from\nthe entertainment industry, big agencies, big tech, like big, big tech, many of the people have\nbeen on this podcast. And they'll host a discussion or debate. And what you find, if you look around the room and you talk to people, is that about half the people in the room are very left-leaning and very outspoken about that. And they'll tell you exactly who they wanna see win\nthe presidential race. And the other half will tell you that they're for the other side. A lot of people that people\nassume are on one side of the aisle or the other are\nin the exact opposite side. Now, some people are very\nopen about who they're for, but it's been very interesting to see how when you get people one-on-one, they're telling you they\nwant X candidate to win or Y candidate to win. And sometimes I'm like, \"Really? I can't believe it. Like, you?\" Like, yep. And so it's what people think about people's political\nleaning is often exactly wrong. And that's been eye-opening for me. And I've seen that in\nuniversity campuses too. It's gonna be really, really interesting to see what happens in November. - In addition to that, as you said, most people are close to the center despite what Twitter makes it seem like. Most people, whether that's\ncenter left to center right, they're kind of close to the center. - Yeah. I mean, to me, the most\ninteresting question, who is gonna be the next big\ncandidate in years to come? Who's that going to be? Right now, I don't see or know of that person. Who's it gonna be? - Yeah, the young promising candidates., we're not seeing them. Another way to ask that question, who would want to be? - Well, that's the issue, right? Who wants to live in\nthis 12-hour news cycle where you're just trying\nto dunk on the other team so that nobody notices that you fucked up? That's not only not fun or interesting, it also is just like... It's gotta be psychosis-inducing\nat some point. And I think that, God willing, we're gonna... Some young guy or woman is on this and refuses to back down and was just determined to be president, and we'll make it happen. I don't even know who the\nviable candidates are. Maybe you, Lex. We should ask Saagar. Saagar would know. - Yeah, yeah. Maybe Saagar himself. - Saagar's show is awesome. - Yeah, it is.\n- He and Crystal do a great thing. - He's incredible. - Especially since they have somewhat divergent opinions on things, that's what makes it so cool. - He's great. He looks great in the\nsuit, looks real sexy. - He's taking real good care of himself. I think he's getting married soon. Congratulations, Saagar. Forgive me for not remembering\nyour future wife's name. - He won my heart by giving me a biography\nof Hitler as a present. - That's what he gave you? - Yeah. - I gave you a hatchet\nwith a poem inscribed- - That just shows the\nfundamental difference- - With a poem inscribed in it, which was pretty damn good."

      "section": "Great white sharks",
      "text": "I realized everything we bring up on the screen is really depressing, like the soccer player getting killed. Can we bring up something happy? - Sure. Let's go to Nature Is Metal Instagram. - That's pretty intense. We actually did a collaborative\npost on a shark thing. - Really? - [Andrew] Yeah. - What kind of shark thing? - So to generate the fear VR stimulus from my lab in 20,... Was it? Yeah, 2016. We went down to Guadalupe\nIsland off the coast of Mexico. Me and a guy named Michael Muller, who's a very famous portrait photographer, but also takes photos of sharks. And we used 360 video to build VR of great white sharks. Brought it back to the lab. We published that study\nin Current Biology. In 2017, went back down there. That was the year that I exited the cage that you lower the cage with the crane. And that year, I exited the cage. I had a whole mess with air failure the day I was breathing from a hookah line while in the cage. I had no scuba on. Divers were out. The thing got boa constricted up, and I had an air failure. And I had to actually share air and it was a whole mess. Story for another time. But the next day, because I didn't want to get PTSD and it was pretty scary, the next day, I cage exited with some other divers. And it turns out with these great white\nsharks in Guadalupe, the water's very clear and\nyou can swim toward them and then they'll veer off\nyou if you swim toward them. Otherwise, they see you as prey. Well, in the evening, you've brought all the cages up and you're hopefully all alive. And we were hanging out fishing for tuna. One of the crew on board\nhad a line in the water and was fishing for tuna for dinner. And a shark took the tuna off the line. It's a very dramatic take. And you can see just absolute size of these great white sharks. The waters there are filled with them. That's the one. So this video, just the Neuralink link was\nshot by Matt MacDougall, who is the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink. There it is. Now, believe it or not, it looks like it missed, like it didn't get the fish. It actually just cut that\nthing like a band saw. So I'm up on the deck with Matt. Yeah. And so when you look at it from the side, you really get a sense of the girth of this fricking thing. So as it comes up, if you... The size of that thing. And they move through the water with such speed, just a couple. So when you're in the cage and the cage is lowered\ndown below the surface, they're going around, you're not allowed to\nchum the water there. Some people do it. And then when you cage exit, they're like, well, what\nare you doing out here? And then you swim toward them, they veer off. But what's interesting is that if you look at how they\nmove through the water, all it takes for one of\nthese great white sharks when it sees a tuna or something it wants to eat\nis like two flicks of the tail and becomes like a missile. It's just unbelievable economy of effort. And Ocean Ramsey who is, in my opinion, the greatest of all\ncage exit shark divers, this woman who dove with\nenormous great white sharks, she really understands their behavior when they're aggressive, when they're not gonna be aggressive. She and her husband, Juan, I believe his name is, they understand how\nthe tiger sharks differ from the great white sharks? We were down there basically\nnot understanding any of this. We never should have been there. And actually, the air\nfailure the day before plus cage exiting the next day, I told myself after coming\nup from the cage exit, \"That's it. I'm no longer taking risks with my life. I want to live.\" Got back across the\nborder a couple days later and I was like, \"That's it. I don't take risks with\nmy life any longer.\" But yeah, MacDougall, Matt\nMacDougall shot that video and then it went, quote, unquote, \"viral\" through the Nature is Metal. We passed them that video. - Actually, I saw a video where an instructor was\nexplaining how to behave with a shark in the water and that you don't wanna be swimming away because then you're acting like a prey. - [Andrew] That's right. - And then you wanna be\nacting like a predator by looking at it and swimming towards it. - [Andrew] Right, towards them and they'll bank off. Now, if you don't see them, they're ambush predators. You're swimming in the surface. - [Lex] Apparently, if they get close, you should just guide\nthem away by grabbing them and moving them away. - Some people will actually roll them, but if they're coming in full speedy, you're not gonna roll the shark. But here we are back to dark stuff again. I like the shark attack map and the shark attack map shows that Northern California, there were a couple, actually. A guy's head got taken off. He was swimming north of San Francisco. There's been a couple\nof northern California that was really tragic, but most of them are in\nFlorida and Australia. - Florida. - The Surfrider Foundation\nshark attack map. There it is. They have a great map. - There you go. - So they look like- - Beautiful. - They have all the scars on them. So if you zoom in on... I mean, look at this. If you go to the North America. - Look at skulls. - Yeah, where there are deadly attacks, but in Northern California, sadly. This is really tragic. If you zoom in on this one. I read about this. This guy, if you can click the link, 52-year-old male, he was in chest high water. This is just tragic. I feel so sad for him and his family. Three members of the party chose to go in. Njai was in his chest-high water, 25 to 50 yards from shore. Breached water seized\nhis head and that was it. So it does happen. It's very infrequent. If you don't go in the ocean, it's a very, very, very low probability. - But if it doesn't happen, six times in a row. - 120% chance. - Yeah. Who do you think wins? a salt water crocodile or a shark? - Okay. I do not like saltwater crocodiles. They scare me to no end. Muller, Michael Muller, who dove all over the world, he sent me a picture of him diving with saltwater crocs in Cuba. It was a smaller one. But goodness, have you seen the size of some of those saltwater crocs? - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm thinking the sharks are so agile. They're amazing. They've head cammed one or bodycammed one moving\nthrough the kelp bed. They're so agile moving through the water. Up at the surface, the camera's looking at the surface. And you just realize if you're out there, and you're swimming, and you get hit by a shark, you're not gonna- - I was gonna talk shit and say that a salty\nhas way more bite force. But according to the internet, recently, data indicates that\nthe shark has a stronger bite. So I was assuming that a crocodile would've\na stronger bite force and therefore agility doesn't matter, but apparently a shark. - Yeah. And turning one of those\nbig salty is probably not that turning around. It's like a battleship. I mean, those sharks are unbelievable. They hit from all sorts. Oh, and they do this thing. We saw this. You're out of the cage or in the cage, and you'll look at one. And you'll see its eye kind\nof like looking at you. They can't really fovea, but they'll look at you. And you're tracking it. And then you'll look down, and you'll realize that\none's coming at you. They're ambush preyers. They're working together. It's fascinating. - I like how you know\nthat they can't fovea you. - [Andrew] Right. - You're already considering\nthe vision system there. It's a very primitive system. - Very primitive eyes\non the side of the head. Their vision is decent enough. They're mostly obviously sensing things with their electro sensing in the water, but also olfaction. Yeah, I spend far too\nmuch time thinking about and learning about the visual systems of different animals. If you get me going on this, we'll be here all night. - See, this is why I\nhave the smuggler on too. I saw this in a store and I got it 'cause this is from a shark. - Goodness. I can't say I ever saw\none with teeth this big, but it's beautiful. It's beautiful. Probably your blood pressure just goes and you don't feel feel a thing. - Yeah. It's not gonna... - Before we went down for the cage exit, a guy in our crew, Pat Dossett, very experienced diver, asked one of the South\nAfrican divers that, \"What's the contingency plan if somebody catches a bite?\" And they were like... He was like every man for himself. And they're like, basically saying like, \"If somebody catches a bite, that's it.\" Anyway, I thought we were\ngonna bring up something happy. - Oh, that is happy. Well, nature is beautiful. - Yeah, nature is beautiful. We lived. There are happy things you brought up. Nature is Metal. See, this is the difference between Russian Americans and Americans."

      "section": "Ayahuasca & psychedelics",
      "text": "It's like maybe this\nis actually a good time to bring up your ayahuasca journey. I've never done ayahuasca, but I'm curious about it. I'm also curious about ibogaine, iboga, but you told me that you did ayahuasca and that for you, it wasn't the dark, scary ride that it is for everybody else. - Yeah, it was an incredible\nexperience for me. I did it twice, actually. - And have you done high dose psilocybin? - Never, no. I just did small dose\npsilocybin a couple times. So I was nervous about it. I was very- - Understandably so. I've done high dose psilocybin. It's terrifying. But I've always gotten\nsomething very useful out of it. - So I mean, I was nervous about whatever demons\nmight hide in the shadow, in the Jungian shadow. I was nervous. But I think it turns out... I don't know what the\nlesson is to draw from that, but my experience- - Be born Russian. - It must be the Russian thing. I mean, there's also\nsomething to the jungle there. It strips away all the bullshit of life and you're just there. I forgot the outside civilization exists. I forgot time because when you don't have your phone, you don't have meetings\nor calls or whatever, you lose a sense of time. The sun comes up, the sun comes down. - That's the fundamental biological timer. Every mammalian species\nhas a short wavelength. So you think like blue UV type, but like absorbing cone and a longer wavelength absorbing cone. And it does this interesting subtraction to designate when it's morning and evening because when the sun is low in the sky, you've got short wavelength\nand long wavelength light. When you look at a sunrise, it's got blues and yellows,\norange and yellows. You look in the evening, reds, orange, and blues. And in the middle of the day, it's full spectrum light. Now, it's always full spectrum light. But because of some atmospheric elements and because of the low solar angle, that difference between\nthe different wavelength of light is the fundamental signal that the neurons in your\neye pay attention to and signal to your circadian\ntimekeeping mechanism. At the core of our brain and the suprachiasmatic nucleus, we are wired to be entrained to the rising and setting of the sun. That's the biological timer. Which makes perfect sense because obviously as the\nplanets spin and revolve. - I also wonder how that is affected. In the rainforest, the sun is not visible often, so you're under the cover of the trees. So maybe that affects- - Well, there are social rhythms. There are feeding rhythms. sometimes in terms of some\nspecies will signal the timing of activity of other species, but yet getting out from\nthe canopy is critical. Of course, even under the\ncanopy during the daytime, there's far more photons than at night. This is always when I'm telling people to get sunlight in their\neyes in the morning and in the evening. People say, \"There's no\nsunlight this time here,\" I'm like, \"Go outside on\na really overcast day. It's far brighter than it is at night.\" So there's still lots of sunlight, even if you can't see\nthe sun as an object. I love time perception shifts. And you mentioned that in the jungle, it's linked to the rising\nand setting of the sun. You also mentioned that on ayahuasca, you zoomed out from the earth. These are like, to me, the\nmost interesting aspects of having a human brain as\nopposed to another brain. Of course, I've only\never had a human brain, which is that you can consciously set your time domain window. We can be focused here. we can be focused on all of Austin, or we can be focused on the entire planet. You can make those choices consciously. But in the time domain, it's hard. Different activities\nbring us into fine slicing or more broad bending of time depending on what we're doing, programming, or exercising,\nor researching, or podcasting. But just how unbelievably\nfluid the human brain is in terms of the aperture\nof the time space window of our cognition and of our experience. I feel like this is perhaps one of the more valuable tools\nthat we have access to that we don't really leverage\nas much as we should, which is when things are really hard, you need to zoom out and see it as one element\nwithin your whole lifespan, and that there's more to come. I mean, people commit suicide because they can't see beyond\nthe time domain they're in, or they think it's gonna go on forever. When we're happy, we rarely think this\nis gonna last forever, which is an interesting\ncontrast in its own right. But I think that psychedelics, while I have very little\nexperience with them, I have some and it sounds like they're\njust a very interesting window into the different apertures. - Well, how To surf that\nwave is probably a skill. One of the things I was prepared for and I think is important is not to resist. - [Andrew] Hmm. - I think I understand what it means to resist a thing, a powerful wave, and it's not going to be good. So you have to be able to surface it. So I was ready for that\nto relax through it. And maybe because I'm quite good at that from knowing how to relax and all kinds of disciplines, playing piano and guitar\nwhen I was super young And then through jujitsu, knowing the value of relaxation and through all kinds of sports to be able to relax the body fully, just accept whatever happens to you. That process is probably why it was a very Positive\nexperience for me. - Do you have any interest in iboga? I'm very interested in ibogaine, iboga. There's a colleague of mine and researcher at\nStanford, Nolan Williams, who's been doing some\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation and brain imaging on people\nwho have taken ibogaine. Ibogaine, as I understand, it gives a 22-hour psychedelic journey where no hallucinations with eyes open, but you close your eyes and you get a very high resolution image of actual events that\nhappened in your life, but then you have agency\nwithin those movies. I think you have to be of healthy heart to be able to do it. I think you have to be\non a heart rate monitor. It's not trivial. It's not like these other psychedelics. But there's a wonderful group\ncalled Veteran Solutions that has used iboga combined\nwith some other psychedelics in the veterans community to great success for things like PTSD. And it's a group I've\nreally tried to support in any way that I can, mainly by being vocal about\nthe great work they're doing. But you hear incredible stories of people who are just like near cratered in their life or zombied by PTSD and other things post-war, get back a lightness or achieve\na lightness and a clarity that they didn't feel they had. So I'm very curious about these compounds. The state of Kentucky, we should check this, but I believe it's taken money from the opioid crisis\nsettlement for ibogaine research. I mean, so this is like no longer... Yes, if you look here. Let's see. Did they do it? Oh no, oh no.\n- No. - They backed away. - Kentucky backs away for the plan to fund opioid treatment research. - They're going to use\nthe money to treat opioid, Now, officials are backing off. 50 billion, what, is on its\nway over the coming years. $50 billion. - $50 billion is on its way to state and local government\nover the coming years. The pool of funding comes\nfrom multiple legal statements with pharmaceutical companies that profited from manufacturing or selling opioid painkillers. - Kentucky has some of the highest number of deaths from the opioid. So they were going to do\npsychedelic research with ibogaine, supporting research on illegal folks. Psychedelic drug called ibogaine. Well, I guess they backed away from it. Well, sooner or later, we'll get some happy\nnews up on the internet during this episode. - I don't know what I'm talking about, the shark and the crocodile fighting. - Yeah, yeah, that's true. That's true. And you survived the jungle. - [Lex] Well, that's the thing. - I was writing to you on\nWhatsApp multiple times 'cause I was gonna put it on the internet. Are you okay? And if you're alive, and then I was gonna\njust put it to Twitter, just like he's alive. But then, of course, you're\nfar too classy for that. So you just came back alive. - Well, jungle or not, one of the lessons is also when you hear the call for adventure, just fucking do it. - I was gonna ask you, it's kind of silly question, but give me a small fraction of things on your bucket list. - Bucket list. - [Andrew] Yeah. - Go to Mars. Yeah, what's the status of that? - I don't know. I'm being patient about the whole thing. - Red Planet ran that\ncartoon of you, guys. That one's pretty funny. - [Lex] That's true, actually. - That one was pretty funny. One where Goggins is already up there, that's a funny one. - Probably also true. I would love to die in Mars. I just love humanity\nreaching onto the stars and doing this a bold adventure and taking big risks and exploring. I love exploration. - What about seeing\ndifferent animal species? I'm a huge fan of this guy, Joel Sartore, where he has this photo arc project where he takes portraits of\nall these different animals. If people aren't already\nfollowing him on Instagram, he's doing some really important work. This guy's Instagram is amazing. - Portraits available. - Well, look at these portraits. The amount of, I don't\nwanna say personality 'cause we don't wanna\nproject anything onto them, but like the eyes, and he'll occasionally put them... This is a little owl. I delight in things like this. I've got some content coming on animals and animal neuroscience and eyes. - [Lex] And dogs or all kinds of things. - All animals. And I'm very interested in kids content that incorporates animals, so we have some things brewing there. I could look at this kind\nof stuff all day long. Look at that bat. People think about bats as\nkind of little flickering, a little annoying disease things. But look how beautiful\nthat little sucker is. - How's your podcast with\nthe Cookie Monster coming? - Oh yeah. We've been in discussions with Cookie. Can't say too much about that, but Cookie Monster\nembodies dopamine, right? Cookie Monster wants cookie, right? Wants cookie right now. It was that one tweet Cookie Monster, \"I bounce because cookies\ncome from all directions.\" It is just embodying the\ndesire for something, which is an incredible\naspect of ourselves. The other one is, do you remember a little while ago, Elmo put out a tweet, \"Hey, how's everyone doing out there?\" And it went viral. And the Surgeon General of the United States had been talking about the loneliness crisis. He came on the podcast. A lot of people have been talking about problems with loneliness, mental health issues with loneliness. Elmo puts out a tweet, \"Hey, how's everyone doing out there?\" And everyone gravitates toward it. The different \"Sesame Street\"\ncharacters really embody the different kind of aspects of self through very narrow neural\ncircuit perspective. Snuffleupagus is shy and Oscar the Grouch, Grouchy, right? And the Count 1, the 2. - [Lex] The archetypes of- - [Andrew] Yeah. - [Lex] The archetypes is\nvery Jungian once again. - Yeah. And I think that the creators of \"Sesame Street\" clearly\neither understand that or it's an unconscious genius to that. So yeah, there are some things brewing on conversations with\n\"Sesame Street\" characters. I know you'd like to\ntalk to Vladimir Putin. I'd like to talk to Cookie Monster. It illustrates the differences in our sophistication or something, illustrates a lot. Yeah, illustrates a lot. I love animation. So I'm not anime, that's not my thing, but animation. So I'm very interested\nin the use of animation to get science content across. So there are a bunch of things brewing. But anyway, I delight in Sartore's work. There's a conservation\naspect to it as well. But I think that mostly wanna thank you for finally putting up something where something's not being\nkilled or some sad outcome. - These are all really positive. - They're really cool. They're really cool. And every once in a while... Look at that mountain lion. But I also like to look at these and some of them remind\nme of certain people. So let's just scroll through. Like for instance, I\nthink when we don't try and process it too much, so, like, okay... Look at this cat, this civic cat. - Amazing. - I feel like this is someone I met once as a young kid.\n- Curiosity. - Curiosity and a playfulness. - Carnivore. - Carnivore, frontalized eyes. - Found in forested areas. - Right. So then you go down. This beautiful fish. - [Lex] Neon pink. - Right. It reminds you of some of\nthe influencers you see on Instagram, except this one's natural. Just kidding. Let's see. - No filter. No filter. - Yeah. Let's see. I feel like- - Bears. I'm a big fan of bears. - Yeah, bears are beautiful. This one kind of reminds\nme of you a little bit. There's like a stoic\nnature to it, a curiosity. So you can kind of feel\nlike the essence of animals. You don't even have to do\npsychedelics to get there. - Oh, look at that. He's like the behind the scenes of how it's actually- - [Andrew] Yeah. And then there's- - Wow.\n- Yeah. - Yeah. In the jungle, the diversity of life was also stark. From a scientific perspective, just the fact that most of those species are not\nidentified was fascinating. - [Andrew] Right. - Every little insect\nis a kind of discovery. - Right. I mean, one of the reasons\nI love New York City so much just by its problems at times is that everywhere you look, there's life. It's like a tropical reef. If you've ever done scuba\ndiving or snorkeling, you look on a tropical reef and it's like there's some\nlittle crab working on something and everywhere you look, there's life. In the Bay Area, if you go scuba diving or snorkeling, it's like a kelp bed. The Bay Area is like a kelp bed. Every once in a while, some big fish goes by. It's like a big IPO. But most of the time, not a whole lot happens. Actually, the Bay Area, t's interesting as I've\nbeen going back there more and more recently. There are really cool\nlittle subculture starting to pop up again. - [Lex] Nice. - There's incredible skateboarding. The GX1000 guys are these\nguys that bomb down hills. They're nuts. They're just going like- - So just speed, not tricks. You gotta see GX1000, these guys going downhill\nin San Francisco. They are wild. And occasionally, unfortunately, occasionally someone\nwill get hit by a car. But GX1000. Look, into intersections, they have spotters. You can see someone there. - Oh, I see. There's a- - Into traffic. Yeah, into traffic. - [Lex] In San Francisco. - Yeah, this is crazy. This is unbelievable. They're just wild. But in any case."

      "text": "- What's on your bucket\nlist that you haven't done? - Well, I'm working on a book. So I'm actually going to head to a cabin for a couple weeks and write, which I've never done. People talk about doing this, but I'm gonna do that. I'm excited for that. Just the mental space of\nreally dropping into writing. - Like Jack Nicholson\nin \"The Shining\" cabin. - Let's hope not. Let's hope not.\n- Okay. - I mean, I only started\ndoing public facing anything, posting on Instagram in 2019, but I used to head up to Gualala on the northern coast of California, sometimes by myself to\na little cabin there and spend a weekend by myself and just read and write\npapers and things like that. I used to do that all the time. I miss that. So some of that. I'm trying to spend a bit more time with my relatives in Argentina, relatives on the east coast, see my parents more. They're in good health, thankfully. I wanna get married and have a family. That's an important priority and putting a lot of work in there. - Yeah, that's a big one. - Yeah, yeah.\n- That's a big one. - Putting a lot of work\ninto the runway on that. - What's your advice\nfor people about that? Or give advice to yourself about how to find love in this world, how to find, how to build a family and get there. - And then I'll listen to it someday and see if I hit the marks. Yeah, well, obviously\npick the right partner, but also do the work on\nyourself, know yourself. The oracle know thyself. Listen, I have a friend, he's a new friend, but he's a friend who I met for a meal. He's a very, very well\nknown actor overseas. And his stuff has made it over here. And we become friends, and we went to lunch. And we were talking about\nwork and being public facing and all this kind of thing. And then I said, \"You have kids, right?\" And he says he has four kids. I was like, \"Oh yeah, I see\nyour posts with the kids, you seem really happy.\" He just looked at me, leaned in and he said, \"It's the best gift you'll ever give yourself.\" And he also said, \"And pick your partner, the mother of your kids very carefully.\" So that's excellent advice\ncoming from somebody who's very successful in work and family. So that's the only thing I can pass along. We hear this from friends of ours as well, but kids are amazing and family's amazing and that's the different people. All these people who\nwant to like be immortal and live to be 200 or something. There's also the old fashioned way of having children that live on and evolve a new legacy, but they have half your DNA. So that's exciting. - Yeah. I think you make an amazing dad. - [Andrew] Thank you. - It seems like a fun thing. I've also gotten the advice from friends who are super high performing\nand have a lot of kids and they'll say, \"Just don't overthink it. Start having kids.\" Let's go. - Well, the chaos of\nkids can either bury you or it can give you energy. But I grew up in a big pack of boys always doing\nwild and crazy things. And so that kind of energy is great. And if it's not a big pack of wild boys and you have daughters, and they can be different\nform of chaos sometimes, same form of chaos. How many kids do you think you want? - Mm. You know, it's either two or five. - Very different dynamics. You're one of two, right? You have a brother? - Yep.\n- Yeah. - I mean, I'm very close with my sister. I couldn't imagine having another sibling 'cause there's so much richness there. We talk almost every day or three, four times a week. Sometimes just briefly. But we're tight we really look out for one another. She's an amazing person, like truly an amazing person and has raised her\ndaughter in an amazing way. My niece is like gonna head to college in a year or two. My sister's done an amazing job and her dad's done a a great job too. They both really put a lot\ninto the family aspect. - Got a chance to spend time with a really amazing person in Peru, in the Amazon jungle. And he is one of 20 kids. - [Andrew] Wow. - It's mostly guys. So it's just a lot of brothers\nand I think two sisters. - Wow. I just had Jonathan Haidt on the podcast, the guy who's talking the anxious generation causing the American mind. He's great. But he was saying that in order to keep kids healthy, they need to not be on social media or have smartphones until they're 16. I've actually been thinking a lot about getting a bunch of friends onto neighboring properties. Everyone talks about this. Not creating a commune\nor anything like that. I think Jonathan's right, more or less our brain wiring does best when we raised in small\nvillage type environments where kids can forage the\nwhole free range kids idea. And I grew up skateboarding and building forts and dirt\nclawed wars and all that stuff. It would be so strange to have a childhood without that. - Yeah. And I think more and more as we wake up to the negative aspects of digital interaction, we'll put more and more value to in-person interaction. - I mean, it's cool to see, for instance, kids in New York City just kind of moving around the city with so\nmuch sense of agency. It's really, really cool. The suburbs where I grew up, as soon as we could get out, take the seven 7F bus up to San Francisco and hang out with wild ones, while there were dangers, I mean, we couldn't wait\nto get outta the suburbs. The moment that forts and dirt clawed wars and stuff didn't cut it, we just wanted into the city. So bucket list, I will probably move to a major city, not Los Angeles or San Francisco, in the next few years. New York City, potentially. - Those are all such different\nflavors of experiences. - Yeah. So I'd love to live in\nNew York City for a while. I've always wanted to do that. And I will do that. I've always wanted to also have a place in a very rural area. So Colorado, Montana are\nhigh on my list right now. And to be able to pivot back and forth between the two would be great, just for such different experiences. And also, I like a very physical life. So the idea of getting up with the sun in a Montana or Colorado type environment. And I've been putting some effort towards finding a spot for that. And New York City to me, I know it's got its issues and people say it wasn't what it was. Okay, I get it. But listen, I've never lived there. So for me, it'd be entirely new. Shul seems full of life. - There is an energy to that city and he represents that. I mean there's- - [Andrew] Yeah. - And the full diversity of weird that is represented in\nNew York City is great. - Yeah, he walked down the street, there's like a person with\nlike a cat on their head and no one gives a shit. - [Lex] Yeah, that's great. - San Francisco used to be like that. The joke was, like, you have to be naked and on fire in San Francisco before someone takes it, but now it's changed. But again, recently I've\nnoticed that San Francisco, it's not just about the skateboarders, there's some community\nhouses of people in tech that are super interesting. There's some community\nhousing of people not in tech that I've learned about and known people have lived there. It's cool. There's stuff happening\nin these cities that's new and different. I mean, that's what youth is for. They're supposed to evolve things out."

      "text": "- So amidst all that, you still have to get shit done. I've been really obsessed\nwith tracking time recently, like making sure I have daily activities. I have habits that I'm maintaining. And I'm very religious about\nmaking sure I get shit done. - Do use an app or something like that? - No, just Google Sheets. So basically a spreadsheet\nand I'm tracking daily. And I write scripts that\nwhenever I achieve a goal, it glows green. - Yeah. Do you track your workouts and all that kind of stuff too? - No. Just the fact that I got the workout done. - [Andrew] Yeah. - So it's a check mark thing. So I'm really, really big\non making sure I do a thing. It doesn't matter how long it is. So I have a rule for myself\nthat I do a set of tasks for at least five minutes every day. And it turns out that many of them, I do way longer, but even just doing it, I have to do it every day. And there's currently 11 of them. And it's just a thing, like one of them is playing\nguitar, for example. So do you do that kind of stuff? Do you do daily habits? - Yeah, I do. I wake up. If I don't feel I slept enough. I do this non-sleep deep\nrest yoga nidra thing that I talked about a bunch. We actually released a few of those tracks as audio tracks on Spotify. 10-minute, 20-minute ones\nputs me back into a state that feels like sleep and I feel very rested. Actually, Matt Walker and\nI are gonna run a study. He's just submitted the\nIRB to run a study on NSDR and what it's actually doing to the brain. There's some evidence of\nincreases in dopamine, et cetera, but those are older studies, still cool studies. So I'll do that. Get up hydrate. And if I've got my act together, I punch some caffeine down, like some Mateína, some coffee, maybe another Mateína, and resistance train three days a week, run three days a week. And then take one day off. And like to be done by 8:39. And then I want to get\ninto some real work. I actually have a sticky\nnote on my computer. It's just like reminding\nme how good it feels to accomplish some real work. And then I go into it right now. It's the book writing,\nresearching a podcast, and just fight tooth and nail to stay off social media, text message, WhatsApp, YouTube, all that. Get something done. - How long can you go? Can you go three hours just deep focus? - If I hit a groove, yeah, 90 minutes to three hours if I'm really in a groove. - That's tough. For me, I start the day... Actually, that's why I'm\nafraid I'd really prize that those morning hours\nI start with the work. - [Andrew] Yeah. - I'm trying to hit the\nfour-hour mark of deep focus. - Great. I love it. - And it often- - Report, report. - Yeah, I'm really, really faithfully... - [Andrew] Yeah. - It's often torture, actually. It's really, really difficult. - Oh yeah. The agitation. But I've sat across the table\nfrom you a couple years ago when I was out here in\nAustin doing some work and I was working on stuff you were... And I noticed you'll just stare\nat your notebook sometimes, just like pen at the same position and then you'll get back into it. There are those building\nthat hydraulic pressure and then go. Yeah, I try and get\nsomething done of value, then the communications start. And talking to my podcast producer. My team is everything. I mean, the magic potion in\nthe podcast is Rob Moore, who's has been in the room with me, every single solo. Costello used to be in there with us because that's it. People have asked, journalists have asked, can they sit in? Friends have asked. Nope, just Rob. And for guest interviews, he's there as well. And I talk to Rob all the time. All the time, we talk multiple times per day. In life, I've made some errors in\ncertain relationship domains in my life in terms of partner choice and things like that. And certainly don't\nblame all of it on them, but I've played my role. But in terms of picking business partners and friends to work with him, I mean, Rob's just... It's been bullseye. Rob has been amazing. Mike Blabac, our photographer, and the guys I mentioned earlier, we just communicate as much as we need to and we pour over every\ndecision like near neuroticism before we put anything out there. - Including like even created decisions of like topics to cover all that. - Yeah, like a photo for the\nbook jacket the other day. Mike shoots photos. And then we look at them, we pour over them together. Logo for the Perform\nPodcast with Andy Galpin that we're launching, is that the right contour? Mike's the real... He's got the aesthetic thing 'cause he was at DC so long as a portrait photographer. And he was close friends with Ken Block who did Jim Connor, like all the car jumping\nin the city stuff. He's a true master of that stuff. And we just pour over\nevery little decision. But even which sponsors, there are dozens of ads now. By the way, that whole jazzer sizer thing of me saying, \"Oh, a guy\nwent from a two to a seven,\" I never said that. That's AI. I would never call number off\nsomebody a two to a seven. Are you kidding me? It's crazy. So it's AI. If you bought the thing, I'm sorry. But like our sponsors, we list the sponsors we have and why on our website. And like the decision, do we work with this person or not? Do we still like the product? I mean, we've got ways with sponsors 'cause of changes in the product. Most of the time, it's amicable, all good, but like just every detail and that just takes a\nton of time and energy. But I try and work mostly on content. And my team's constantly trying to keep me out of the other discussions 'cause I obsess. You have to have a team of some sort, someone that you can run things by - For sure. But one of the challenges, the larger the team is, and I'd like to be involved in a lot of different kinds of stuff, including engineering stuff,\nrobotics, work, research, all of those interactions,\nat least for me, take away from the deep work, the deep focus.\n- Right, right. - Unfortunately, I get\ndrained by social interaction even with the people I love and really respect and\nall that kind of stuff. - [Andrew] You're an introvert. - Yeah. Fundamentally an introvert. So to me, it's a trade off getting shit\ndone versus collaborating. And I have to choose wisely because without collaboration,\nwithout a great team, which I'm fortunate\nenough to be a part of, you wouldn't get anything really done. But as an individual contributor, to get stuff done, to do the hard work of\nresearching or programming, all that kind of stuff, you need the hours of deep work. - I used to spend a lot more time alone. That's on my bucket list, spend a bit more time\ndropped into work alone. I think social media causes our brain to go the other direction. I try and answer some comments and then get back to work. - After going to the jungle, I appreciate not using the device. I've played with the\nidea of spending certain, maybe like one week a month\nnot using social media at all. - I used it. So after that morning block, I'll eat some lunch and I'll usually do something while I'm doing lunch or something. And then a bit more work and\nthat real work, deep work. And then round 2:30, I do a non-sleep deep rest, take a short nap, wake up, boom, maybe a little more caffeine, and then lean into it again. I find if you've really\nput in the deep work two or three bouts per day\nby about 5:00 or 6:00 PM, it's over. I was down at Jocko's\nplace not that long ago in the evening, did a sauna session with him and some family members of his and some of their friends. And it's really cool. They all work all day and train all day. And then in the evening, they get together, and they sauna and cold plunge. I'm really into this\nwhole thing of gathering with other people at a\nspecific time of day. I have a gym at my house. Tim will come over and train. We've kind of slowed that\ndown in recent months. But I think gathering\nin groups once a day, being alone for part of the day, and it's very fundamental stuff. We're not saying anything that hasn't been said\nmillions of times before, but how often do actually do that? And call the party. Be the person to bring people together if it's not happening. That's something I've really had to learn even though I'm an introvert. Like, \"Hey!\" I'm like, \"Gather people together.\" You came through town the other day and a lot of people at the house. It was rad. Actually, I was playing 'cause I was getting a\nmassage when you walked in. I don't sit around getting\nmassages very often, but I was getting one that day. And then everyone came\nin, and the dog came in, and everyone was piled in. It was very sweet. - Again, no devices, but choose wisely the\npeople you gather with."

I understood that from my ayahuasca and from just the experience\nin the jungle is, like, just select the people. Just be careful how\nyou allocate your time. I just saw somewhere. Conor McGregor has this good line, I wrote it down, about loyalty. He said, \"Don't eat with people\nyou wouldn't starve with.\" - Ooh. - I mean, he's big on loyalty. All the shit talk, all of that, set that aside. To me, loyalty is really big because then if you invest in\ncertain people in your life and they stick by you\nand you stick by them, what else is life about? - Yeah. Well, hardship will show you\nwho your real friends are. That's for sure. And we're fortunate to have a lot of them. It'll also show you who really has put in the time to try and understand you\nand understand people. People are complicated. I love that. So you read the quote once more. - Don't eat with people\nyou wouldn't starve with. Yeah. So in that way, a hardship is a gift. It shows you. - Definitely. And it makes you stronger. It definitely makes you stronger. - Let's go get some food. Yeah, you are one meal a day guy. - Yeah. I actually ate something earlier, but it was like a protein shake and a couple pieces of biltong. I hope we're eating a steak. - I hope so too. I'm full of nicotine and caffeine. - Yeah. What do you think? How you feel?\n- I feel good. - Yeah. I was thinking you'd probably... I only did a half a piece and I won't have more for\na little while, but... - [Lex] Little too good. - [Andrew] Yeah. - Thank you for talking\nonce again, brother. - Yeah, thanks so much, Lex. It's been a great ride,\nthis podcast thing. And you're the reason\nI started the podcast. You inspired me to do it. You told me to do it. I did it. And you've also been an amazing friend.

  "full_text": "- Hardship will show you\nwho your real friends are. That's for sure. - Can you read the quote once more? Don't eat with people\nyou wouldn't starve with. The following is a conversation\nwith Andrew Huberman, his fifth time on the podcast. He is the host of the Huberman Lab Podcast and is an amazing scientist,\nteacher, human being, and someone I'm grateful to be able to call a close friend. Also, he has a book coming out next year that you should pre-order now called \"Protocols: An Operating\nManual for the Human Body.\" This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Huberman. You think there's ever gonna be a day when you walk away from podcasting? - Definitely. I mean, I came up within and then on the periphery\nof skateboard culture. And for the record, I was not a great skateboarder. I always have to say that 'cause skateboarders are relentless. If you call something you\ndidn't do or whatever, I mean, I could do a few things. And I loved the community and I still have a lot of\nfriends in that community. Jim Thiebaud at Deluxe, you can look them up. He's kind of the man\nbehind the whole scene. I know Tony, Hawk, Danny Whale, all these guys. I got to see them come up and get big and stay big. In many cases, start huge companies like\nDanny and Colin McKay are DC. Some people have a long life\nin something, some don't. But one thing I observed and learned a lot from skateboarding at the level of observing\nthe skateboarders and then the ones that started companies, and then what I also observed in science and still observe is\nyou do it for a while, you do it at the highest\npossible level for you. And then at some point, you pivot and you start supporting the young talent coming in. In fact, the greatest scientists, people like Richard Axel, Catherine Dulac, there are many other labs in neuroscience. Karl Deisseroth. They're not just known\nfor doing great science. They're known for mentoring some of the best scientists that then go on to start their own labs. And I think in podcasting, I am very fortunate I got\nin in a fairly early wave, not the earliest wave, but thanks to your suggestion of doing a podcast fairly early wave. And I'll continue to go\nas long as it feels right and I feel like I'm\ndoing good in the world and providing good, but I'm already starting to scout talent. My company that I started with Rob Moore, Scicomm Media. There's a couple other guys in there too. Mike Blabac, our photographer, Ian Mackey. Chris Ray, Martin Fobes. We are a company that\nproduces podcasts right now. That's Huberman Lab Podcast. But we're launching a new podcast, Perform with Dr. Andy Galpin. - [Lex] Nice. - And we wanna do more\nof that kind of thing, finding really great talent, highly qualified people,\ncredentialed people. And I've got a new kind of obsession with scouring the internet, looking for the young talent in science, in health and related fields. And so will there be a\nfinal episode of the HLP? Yeah, I mean, bullet buster cancer aside, someday they'll be the very last and thank you for your\ninterest in science, and I'll clip out. - Yeah. I love the idea of walking away and not be dramatic about it. When it feels right, you can leave and you can come back\nwhenever the fuck you want. - [Andrew] Right. - Jon Stewart did this\nwell with \"The Daily Show.\" I think that was during the 2016 election when everybody wanted him to stay on and he just walked away. Dave Chappelle, for different\nreasons, walked away. - Disappeared, came back. - Gave away so much money. Didn't care. And then came back and was doing standup in the park in the middle of nowhere. Genius. You have Habib who, undefeated, walks away at the very top of a sport. - Is he coming back? - No, he's done. - At least we don't know. Yeah. - Right, you don't know. I don't know if he knows. - It bears everywhere our word. (both laughing) - Yeah, I think it's always a call. The last few years have\nbeen tremendous growth. We launched in January 2021. And even this last year, 2024 has been huge growth\nin all sorts of ways. It's been wild. And we have some short\nform content planned, 30-minute shorter episodes that really distill down\nthe critical elements. We're also thinking about moving to other venues besides podcasting. So there's always the\nthought and the discussion, but when it comes to when\nto hang up your cleats, it's like there just comes a natural time where you can do more to mentor the next generation coming in, then focusing on self. And so there will come a time for that. And I think it's critical. I mean, again, I saw\nthis in skateboarding. Like Danny, and Colin, and Danny's brother Damon\nstarted DC with Ken Block, the driver who unfortunately passed away a little while ago, rally car driver. And they eventually sold it, I think to Quicksilver\nor something like that. But they're all phenomenal talents in their respective areas. But they brought in the\nnext line of amazing riders, the plan B thing, Paul Rodriguez. For skateboarders, they know who this is. Now, in science, there are scientists like\nFeynman, for instance. I don't know if anyone can name one of his mentor offspring. So there are scientists\nwho are phenomenal, like beyond world class, multi-generational world class who don't make good mentors. I'm not saying he wasn't good mentor, but that's not what he's known for. And then there are\nscientists who are known for being excellent\nscientists and great mentors. And I think there's no higher celebration to be had at the end of one's career. If you can look back and be like, \"Hey, I put some really\nimportant knowledge into the world. People made use of that knowledge.\" And guess what? You spawned all these\nother scientific offspring or sport offspring or podcast offspring. I mean, in some ways, we look to Rogan and to some of the other\nearlier podcasts is, like, they paved the way. Rhonda Patrick, First\nScience Podcast out there. Eventually, the baton passes. Fortunately, right now, everybody's active and\nit feels really good. Yeah, well, you're talking about the healthy way to do it, but there's also a different kind of way where you have somebody\nlike Grigori Perelman, the mathematician who refused\nto accept the Fields Medal. So he's one of the greatest\nliving mathematicians, and he just walked away from mathematics and rejected the Fields Medal. - What did he do after\nhe left Mathematics? - Life, private, 100%. - I respect that. - He's become essentially\nrecluse is these photos of him looking very broke. He could use the money. He turned away the money. He turned away everything. You just have to listen\nto the inner voice. You have to listen to yourself and make the decisions\nthat don't make any sense for the rest of the world\nand makes sense to you. - I mean, Bob Dylan didn't show up to pick up his Nobel Peace Prize. That's punk. - Yeah. - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - He probably grew in notoriety for that. Maybe he just doesn't\nlike going in Sweden, but seemed like it would be a fun trip. I think they do it in a nice time of year, but, hey, that's his right. He earned that right. - I think the best artists\naren't doing it for the prize. They aren't doing it for\nthe fame or the money. They're doing it because they love the art. - Yeah, that's the Rick Rubin thing. You gotta verb it through, download your inner thing. I don't think we've talked about this, this obsession that I have\nabout how Rick has this way of being very, very still in his body, but keeping his mind\nvery active as a practice when spent some time with\nhim in Italy last June. And we would tread water\nin his pool in the morning and listen to history of rock\nand roll and a hundred songs. Amazing podcast, by the way. - It is. - Yeah. And then he would spend\na fair amount of time during the day in this\nkind of meditative state where his mind is very\nactive body, very still. And then Karl Deisseroth, when he came on my podcast, talked about how he forces\nhimself to sit still and think in complete\nsentences late at night after his kids go to sleep. And there's a state of mind, rapid eye movement sleep, where your body is completely paralyzed and the mind is extremely active. And people credit rapid eye movement sleep with some of the more\nelaborate emotion-filled dreams and the source of many ideas. And there are other examples. Einstein, people described\nhim as taking walks around the Princeton campus, then pausing and would\nask him what was going on and the idea that his mind was continuing to churn forward at a higher rate. So this is far from controlled studies, but we're talking about\nsome incredible minds and creatives who have a practice of stilling the body while keeping the mind\ndeliberately very active, very similar to rapid eye movement sleep. And then there are a lot of people who also report great ideas coming to them in the shower, while running. So it can be the opposite as well, where the body is very active and the mind is perhaps more on kind of like a default mode network, not really focusing on\nany one specific thing. - Interesting. There's a bunch of physicists and mathematicians I've talked to. They talk about sleep deprivation and going crazy hours through the night, obsessively pursuing a thing. And then the solution to the problem comes when they finally get rest. - We just did this\nsix-episode special series on sleep with Matt Walker. We know that when you\ndeprive yourself of sleep and then you get sleep, you get a rebound in\nrapid eye movement sleep, you get a higher percentage of rapid eye movement sleep. And Matt talks about this in the podcast,. And he did an episode\non sleep and creativity, sleep and memory, and rapid eye movement sleep\ncomes up multiple times in that series. There's also some very interesting stuff about cannabis withdrawal and rapid eye movement sleep. People are coming off\ncannabis often will suffer from insomnia, but when they finally do start sleeping, they dream like crazy. Cannabis is a very\ncontroversial topic right now. - Oh yeah, I saw that. What happened? There's a bunch of drama around episode you did on cannabis. - Yeah, we did a episode about cannabis, talked about the health benefits\nand the potential risks. It's neither here nor there. Depends on the person, depends on the age, depends on genetic background, a number of other things. We published that episode\nwell over a year ago and it had no issues online, so to speak. And then a clip of it was put to X where the real action occurs\nas your favorite spot. Yeah, the four ounce gloves as opposed to the 16 ounce gloves that is X versus Instagram or YouTube. There was kind of an immediate dog pile from a few people in the\ncannabis research field. - The PhDs and MDs, yeah. - There were people on our side. There were people not our side. I mean, the statement\nthat got things riled up the most was this notion that for certain individuals, there's a high potential\nfor inducing psychosis with high THC containing cannabis for certain individuals, not all. That sparked some issues. There was really a split. You see this in different fields. There was one person in particular who came out swinging with language that in my\nopinion is not like of the sort that you would use at a university venue, especially among colleagues. But that's fine. We're all grownups. - Well, for me, from my perspective, it was strangely rude. And it had an era of elitism that to me, was it the source of\nthe problem during COVID that led to the distrust of science and the popularization\nof disrespecting science because so many scientists\nspoke with an arrogance and a douchebag array that I wish we would have\na little bit less of? - Yeah, it's tough because most academics don't understand that people outside the\nuniversity system are... They're not familiar with\nthe inner workings of science and the culture. And so you have to be very careful how you present when you're\na university professor. So he came out swinging at a\nfour-letter word type language, and he was obviously upset about. So I simply said what\nI would say anywhere, which was, \"Hey, look,\ncome on the podcast. Let's chat And why don't you tell me where I'm wrong and let's discuss.\" And fortunately, he agreed. And initially, he said, \"Well, no, how can I be sure you're not gonna misrepresent me?\" We got on a DM, then an email, then eventually phone call and just said, \"Hey, listen, you're welcome to record the whole conversation. We've never done a gotcha on my podcast. Let's just get to the heart of the matter. I think this little\ncontroversy is perfect kindling for a really great discussion.\" And he had some other\nconditions that we worked out. And I felt like, cool. He's really interested, although you get a very different person on the phone than you do on Twitter. I will say he's been very collegial and that conversation is on the schedule. I said, \"We'll fly you out. We'll put you up.\" He said, no, he wants to fly himself. He really wants to make sure that there's kind of a\nspace between, I think, some of the perception of\nscience and health podcasts in the academic community\nis that it's all designed to sell something. No, we run ads, so it can be free to everyone else. Look, in the end, he agreed and I'm excited for the conversation. It was interesting because in the wake of\nthat little exchange, there's been a bunch of press from traditional press about cannabis has now surpassed alcohol in many cultures within\nthe United States as... When I say cultures, I mean, demographics. The United States as the drug of choice. There have been people\nhighlighting the issues of potential psychosis\nin high THC containing. And so it's kind of interesting to see how traditional media is sort of onboard certain elements\nthat I put forward. And I think there's some controversy as to whether or not\nthe different strains, the indicas and sativa are\nbiologically different, et cetera. So we'll get down into the weeds, pun intended, during that one. And I'm excited. It's the first time that we've responded to\na direct criticism online about scientific content in a way that really promoted like, oh, the idea of inviting\na particular guest. And so it's great. Let's get a guest who's\nexpert in cannabis. I believe, I could be wrong about this, but he's a behavioral neuroscientist at slightly different training. But look, he seems highly credentialed. It'd be fun. And we welcome that kind of exchange. I'm not being diplomatic. I'm just saying it's cool. He's coming on. - [Lex] No, you- - And he was friendly on the phone. He literally came out online and was basically kind of like FU, like F this and FU. But you get someone on the phone, it's like, \"Hey, how's it going?\" And they're like, \"Oh yeah, well...\" There was an immediate apology of like, \"Hey, listen, I came out. Normally, I'm not like that, but online....\" Yeah, you get a different. - Okay, listen. - It's a little bit like jujitsu, right? People say all sorts of things, I guess. But if you're like, \"All\nright, well, let's go,| then it's probably a different story. - It's not like jujitsu. 'cause in jujitsu, people don't talk shit 'cause they know what\nthe consequences are. Let me just say on mic and off mic, you have been very respectful\ntowards this person. And I look up to you and respect you and admire the fact that you have been. That said to me, that guy was being a dick. And when you graciously,\npolitely invited him on the podcast, he was still talking down\nto you the whole time, so I really admire and look forward to\nlistening to you talk to him, but I hope others don't do that. You are a positive, humble voice, exploring all the interesting\naspects of science. You want to learn. If you've got anything wrong, you wanna learn about it. The way he was being a dick, I was just hurt a little bit. Not because of him, but 'cause like there's some people I really, really admire, brilliant scientists that are not their best\nselves on Twitter, on X. - [Andrew] Definitely. - I don't understand what\nhappens to their brain. - Well, they regress. They regress. And they also are protected. I mean, no scientific\nargument should ever come to physical blows. But when you remove the real world thing of being right in front of somebody, people will throw all sorts\nof stones at a distance and over a wall. And they've got their\nwife, or their husband, or their boyfriend, or their dog, or their cat to go cuddle\nwith them afterwards. But you get in a room and it's like confrontational people in real life are pretty rare. Hopefully, if they do it, they're willing to back it up\nwith knowledge in this case. We're not talking about\nphysical altercation. He kept coming, and he kept putting on conditions. How do I know you want this? And I was like, \"Well, you\ncan record the conversation.\" \"How do I know you want that?\" \"Listen, we'll pay for you to come out.\" How do you know...\" And eventually, he just kind of relented. To his credit, he's agreed to come on. I mean, he still has to show up. But once he does, we'll treat him right, like we would any other guest. - Yeah, you treat people really well. I just hope that people\nare a little bit nicer on the internet. - Yeah. Well, X is an interesting one because it thickens your skin to just to go on there. I mean, you have to be ready to deal with- - Sure. But I can still criticize\npeople for being douchebags 'cause that's still not\ngood inspiring behavior. Especially for scientists, that should be sort of symbols\nof scientific thinking, which requires intellectual humility. Humility is a big part of that. And Twitter is a good\nplace to illustrate that. - Yeah. Years ago, I was a student in TA, then instructor, and then directed a cold\nspring harbor course on visual neuroscience. These are summer courses that explore different topics. And at night, we would host what we hoped were battles in front of the students where you'd get two people on... Would it be neural prosthetics or molecular tools that\nwould first restore vision to the blind kind of arguments? It's kind of a silly argument 'cause it's gonna be\na combination of both. But you'd get these great arguments, but the arguments were\nalways couched in data. And occasionally, you'd get\nsomebody would go, like, \"Argh!\" or would curse or something, but it was the rare, very well placed insult. It wasn't coming out swinging. I think ultimately Twitter's a record of people's behavior. The internet is a record\nof people's behavior. And here I'm not talking\nabout news reports about people's behavior. I'm talking about how\npeople show up online is really important. You've always carried yourself with a ton of composure and respect. You would hope that people\nwould grow from that example. Well, I'll tell you that the podcasters that I'm scouting, it's their energy, but it's also how they treat other people, how they respond to comments. We're blessed to have\npretty significant reach when we put out a podcast, of someone else's podcast, it goes far and wide. So like a skateboard team, like a laboratory where\nyou're selecting people to be in your lab, you want to pick people that you would enjoy working with and that are collegial. Etiquette is lacking nowadays, but you're in the suit and tie. You're bringing it back. - Bringing it back. - You said that your\nconversation with James Hollis, a Jungian psychoanalyst\nhad a big impact on you. What do you mean? - James Hollis is a 84-year-old\nJungian psychoanalyst who's written 17 books, including \"Under Saturn's Shadow,\" which is on the healing and trauma of men, the Eden Project, excuse me, which is about relationships\nand creating a life. I discovered James Hollis online lecture that was recorded I think in San Diego. It's on YouTube. The audio is terrible\ncalled \"Creating a Life.\" And this was somewhere\nin the 2011 to 2015 span. I can't remember. And I was on my way to Europe and I called my girlfriend at the time. I was like, \"I just found\nthe most incredible lecture I've ever heard.\" And he talks about the shadow. He talks about your\ndevelopmental upbringing and how you either align with or go 180 degrees off\nyour parents' tendencies and values in certain areas. He talked about the\nspecific questions to ask of oneself at different stages of life to live a full life. So it's always been a\ndream of mine to meet him and to record a podcast. And he wasn't able to travel. So our team went out to DC and sat down with him. We rarely do that nowadays. People come to our studio. And he came in. He had some surgeries recently and he kind of came in\nwith some assistance from a a cane and then sat down and just blew my mind. From start to finish, he didn't miss a syllable. And every sentence that he spoke was like a quotable sentence with real potency and actionable items. I think one of the things that was most striking\nto me was how he said, when we take ourselves out\nof stimulus and response, and we just force ourselves to spend some time in\nthe quiet of our thoughts while walking or while\nseated or while lying down. Doesn't have to be meditation, but it could be that we\naccess our unconscious mind in ways that reveals to us who we really are and what we really want. And that if we do that\npractice repeatedly, 10 minutes a day here, 15 minutes a day there, that we start to really\ntouch into our unique gifts and the things that make us each us and the directions we need to take. But that so often we just\nstay in stimulus response. We just do, do, do, do do, which is great. We have to be productive, but we miss those important messages. And interestingly, he also\nput forward this idea of... What is this? It's like get up, shut up, suit up. Yeah, something like that. Get out of bed, suit up, and shut up, and get to work. He also has that in him, kind of a Goggins type mindset. - So be able to turn off\nall this self-reflection and self-analysis and just get shit done. - Get shit done. But then also dedicate time and stop and just let stuff geyser to the surface from the unconscious mind. And he quotes Shakespeare, and he quotes Jungian. And he quotes everybody through history with incredible accuracy and, and exactly the way needed\nto drive home a point. That conversation to me was one that I really felt like, okay, if I don't wake up tomorrow for whatever reason, that one's in the can. And I feel really great about it. To me, it's the most\nimportant guest recording we've ever done in particular because he has wisdom. And while I hope he lives to be 204, chances are, he's got\nanother 20, 30 years with us, hopefully more. But I really, really wanted\nto capture that information and get it out there. So I'm very, very proud of that one. And he's the kind of guy that anyone listens to him, young, old male, female, whatever. And you're gonna get something of value. What do you think about this idea of the shadow that the good and the bad that we repress, that hides from plain sight when we analyze ourselves, that's there? You think there's like a ocean that we we don't have direct access to? - Yes. Yeah, Jungian said it. We have all things inside of us and we do. And some people are more in touch with those than others. And some people, it's repressed. I mean, does that mean that we could all be horrible people or marvelous people, benevolent people? Perhaps. Thankfully, more often than not, people lean away from the violent and harmful parts of their shadow. But I think spending time thinking about one's shadows is super important. How else are we going to grow? Otherwise, we have these\nunconscious blind spots of denial or repression or whatever the psychiatrists tell us. But yeah, it clearly\nexists within all of us. I mean, we have neural circuits for rage. We all do. We have neural circuits for altruism and no one's born without these things. And some people, they're atrophied. And some people, they're hypertrophied. But looking inward and\nrecognizing what's there is key. - Or positive things like creativity. Maybe that's what Rick Rubin is accessing. When you go silent body, active mind, that's interesting. What is it for you? What place do you go to\nthat generates ideas, that helps you generate ideas? - I have a lot of new\npractices around this. I mean, I'm always\nexploring for protocols. I have to. It's in my nature. When I went and spent time with Rick, I tried to adopt his practice\nof staying very still and just letting stuff come to the surface or Deisserothian way of\nformulating complete sentences while being still in the body. What I have found works better is what my good friend Tim\nArmstrong does to write music. He writes music every day. He's a music producer. He is obviously a singer/guitar\nplayer for Rancid. And he's helped dozens and dozens and dozens of female pop artists and punk rock artists write great songs. And many of the famous songs that you've heard from other artists, Tim helped them write. Tim wakes up sometimes in\nthe middle of the night. And what he does is he'll\nstart drawing or painting. So what he's done, and Joni Mitchell talks about this too, you find some creative outlet that's like 15 degrees off center from your main creative outlet and you do that thing. So for me, that's drawing. I like doing anatomical drawings, neuroscience-based\ndrawing, drawing neurons, that kind of thing. And if I do that for a little while, my mind starts churning on the\nnervous system and biology. And then I come up with\nareas I'd like to explore for the podcast, ways I'd like to address certain topics. Right now, I'm very interested\nin autonomic control. A beautiful paper came out that shows that anyone can learn to\ncontrol their pupil sizes and without changing luminance through a biofeedback mechanism. And that gives them auto control over their so-called automatic\nautonomic nervous system. And I've been looking\nat what the circuitry is and it's beautiful. So I'll draw the circuitry that we know underlies autonomic function. And as I'm doing that, I'm thinking, oh, like what\nabout autonomic control and those people that\nsupposedly can control their pupil size? Then you go in and there's a paper\npublished in Nature Press, one of the Nature journals. And there's a recent paper on this. Like, oh cool. And then we talk about this. And then how could this be\nput into a kind of a post? So doing things that are\nabout 15 degrees off center from your main thing is\na great way to access. I believe that the circuits\nfor, in Tim's case, painting goes to songwriting. I think for Joni Mitchell, that was also the case. I think it was drawing and painting to singing and songwriting. For Rick, I don't know what it is. Maybe it's listening to podcasts. I don't know. That's his business. Do you have anything that you like to focus on that allows you\nthen an easier transition into your main creative work? - No, I really like to focus\non emptiness and silence. So I pick the dragon I have to slay, so whatever the problem I have to work on and I just sit there and stare at it. - I love how fucking linear you are. - And if there's no, if you're tired, I'll just sit. I believe in the power of just waiting. And usually, I'll stop being tired or energy rises from somewhere or an idea pops from somewhere, but there needs to be a\nsilence and an emptiness. It's an empty room, just me and the dragon and we wait. That's it. Usually with programming, you're thinking about a particular design. How do I design this thing\nto solve this problem? - Any cognitive enhancers? I've got a quite the\ngallery in front of me. - Oh that's right, yeah. - Should we walk through this? - Yeah. - This is not a a sales thing, It's just I tend to do\nthis bounce back and forth. Your refrigerator just happened to have a lot of different choices. So water. - This is all my refrigerator. - I know, right? There's no food in there. There's water. There's Element which\nthey now have canned. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - And yes, they're a podcast\nsponsor for both of us, but that's not why I\ncracked one of these open. I like them provided they're cold. - And that's, by the way,\nmy least favorite flavor as I was saying. That's the reason it's\nstill left in the fridge. - The cherry one is really good. - The black cherry. There's orange one. - Yeah. I pushed the sled this morning and pulled the sled for\nmy workout at the gym. And it was hot today here in Austin, so some salt is good. And then Mateína Yerba Mate,\nzero sugar, full confession. I helped develop this. I'm a partial owner, but I love yerba mate. Half Argentine. Been drinking mate since\nI was a little kid. There's actually a photo\nsomewhere on the internet when I'm like three, sitting on my grandfather's lap, sipping mate out the gourd. And then this you might find interesting, this is just a little bit\nof coffee with a scoop of... Brian Johnson gave me cocoa, just like pure unsweetened cocoa. So I put that in chocolate. I like it,. - Just for the taste. - Well, actually, nukes my appetite. And since we're not going out to dinner tonight until later, I figure that's good. Yeah, Brian's an interesting one. He's really pushing this thing. - The optimization of everything. - Yeah. Although he just hurt his ankle, he posted a photo, he hurt his ankle. So now he's injecting BPC\nbody protection compound 157, which many, many people\nare taking, by the way, I did an episode on peptides. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - I should just say BPC 157, one of the known effects in animal models is angiogenesis, like development of new vasculature, which can be great in some context, but also if you have a tumor, you don't really want to vascularize that tumor anymore. So I worry about people\ntaking BPC 157 continually. And there's very little human data. I think there's like one study and it's a lousy one. It's a lot of animal data. Some of the peptides are interesting. However, there's one that\nI've experimented with a little bit called Pinealon, which I find even if I've\njust taken it twice a week before sleep, then it seems to do something to the circadian timekeeping mechanism because then on other\ndays when I don't take it, I get unbelievably tired at that time that normally I would do the injection. These are things that I'll experiment with for a couple weeks\nand then typically stop, maybe try something else. But I stay out of things\nthat really stimulate any of like major hormone pathways when it comes to peptides. - That's actually a really good question of how do you experiment? How long do you try a thing to figure out if it works for you? - Well, I'm very\nsensitive to these things, and I have been doing a lot\nof things for a long time. So if I add something in, it's always one thing at a time, and I notice right away if it does not make me feel good. There's a lot of excitement about some of the so-called growth\nhormone secretagogues, ipamorelin, tesamorelin, and sermorelin. And I've experimented a little bit with those in the past and they've nuked to my\nrapid eye movement sleep. But given me a lot of deep sleep, which doesn't feel good to me, but other people like them. I also just generally try and avoid taking peptides that tap into these hormone pathways because you can run into\nall sorts of issues, but some people take them safely. But usually after about four or five days, I know if I like something or I don't and then I move on. But I am not super\nadventurous with these things. I know people that will\ntake cocktails of peptides with multiple things. They'll try anything. That's not me. And I do blood work,. But also I'm mainly reading\npapers and podcasting. And I'm teaching a course\nnext spring, Stanford. I'm gonna do a big undergraduate course. So I'm trying to develop that course and things like that. So I don't need to lift more weight or run further than I already do, which is not that much\nweight or far as it is. - Right. You're not going to Olympics. You're not trying to\ntruly maximize some aspect of your performance. - No. And I'm not trying to\nget down below, whatever, 7% body fat or something. I don't have those kinds of goals. So hydration, electrolytes, caffeine in the form of mate and then this coffee thing. And then here's one that, I think, I brought out for discussion. This is a piece of Nicorette. They're not a sponsor. Nicotine is an interesting compound. It will raise blood pressure, and it is probably not safe for everybody. But the nicotine is gaining\nin popularity like crazy. Mainly, these pouches that\npeople put in the lip,. We're not talking about\nsmoking vaping, dipping, or snuffing. My interest in nicotine started, this was in 2010, I was visiting Columbia Medical School, and I was in the office of the great neurobiologist, Richard Axel, won the Nobel Prize, co-recipient with Linda\nBuck for the discovery of the molecular basis of olfaction. Brilliant guy. He's probably in his late\nseventies now, probably. Yeah. And he kept popping Nicorette in his mouth and I was like, \"What's this about?\" And he said, \"Oh well,\nthis was just anecdote.\" But he said this, he said, \"Oh well, it\nprotects against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.\" I said, \"It does/?\" And he goes, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\" I don't know if he was kidding or not. He's known for making jokes. And then he said that\nwhen he used to smoke, it really helped his focus in creativity. But then he quit smoking 'cause he didn't want lung cancer and he found that he\ncouldn't focus as well, so he would choose Nicorette. So occasionally, right now, I do a half a piece, but I'm not Russian so I'm a little... You did just pop the\nwhole thing in your mouth. - Mm-hmm. - So I'll do a couple\nmilligrams every now and again. And it definitely sharpens the mind on an empty stomach in particular. But you fast all day, you're still doing one meal a day, - One meal a day. - Yeah. - Yeah, I did a nicotine\npouch with Rogan at dinner and I got high. - Yeah, that's a lot. That's usually six or eight milligrams. I know people that get a canister of Zin, take one a day, pretty soon they're\ntaking a canister a day. So you have to be very careful. I will only allow myself two pieces of Nicorette total per week. And you will notice that in the day after you use it, sometimes your throat\nwill feel a little bit like a little spasm, like you might want to\ncough once or twice. And so if you're a singer or you're a podcaster or something, you have to do long podcast, you wanna just be mindful of it. But yeah, you're supposed\nto kind of like keep it in your cheek and here we go. - But it did make me intensely focus in a way that was a\nlittle bit scary 'cause... - The nucleus basalis is\nin the in basal forebrain. Nucleus has cholinergic neurons that radiate out axons, little wires that release acetylcholine into the neocortex and elsewhere. And when you focus on one\nparticular topic matter or one particular area\nof your visual field or listening to something\nand focusing visually, we know that there's an\nelaboration of the amount of acetylcholine released there, and it binds to nicotinic acetylcholine\nreceptor sites there. So it's a kind of an\nintentional modulation by acetylcholine. With nicotine, you're getting exogenous or artificial heightening\nof that circuitry. - And the time I had Tucker\nCarlson on the podcast, he told me that apparently, it helps him, as he said publicly, keep his love life vibrant. - Really? It causes vasoconstriction. - Well, he literally said it\nmakes his dick really hard. He said that publicly also. - Okay, well, as little as I want to think about Tucker Carlson's- - Trust me. - Sex life, no disrespect. The major effect of nicotine\non the vasculature., my understanding is that\nit causes vasoconstriction, not vasodilation. Drugs like Cialis,\nTadalafil, Viagra, et cetera, vasodilators, they allow more blood flow. Nicotine does the opposite, less blood flow to the periphery. But provided dosages are kept low... I don't recommend people\nuse it frequently or at all. And I don't recommend young people use it, 25 and younger. Brain's very plastic at that time. And certainly smoking,\ndipping, vaping aren't good because we run into\ntrouble for other reasons. But in any case, and even there, vaping is a controversial topic. Probably safer than smoking, but has its own issues. I said something like that and boy did I catch a\nlot of heat for that. You can't say anything as\na health science educator and not piss somebody off. It just depends on where\nthe center of masses and how far outside that you are. For me, the caffeine is the main thing. And actually, it's a\nreally big part of my life. And one of the things you recommend that people wait a bit in the morning to consume caffeine. - If they experience a\ncrash in the afternoon, that this is one of the\nmisconceptions I regret maybe even discussing it, for people that crash in the afternoon, oftentimes if they delay their caffeine by 60 and 90 minutes in the morning, they will offset some of that. But if you eat a lunch that's too big or you didn't sleep well the night before, you're not gonna avoid\nthat afternoon crash. But I'll wake up sometimes and go straight to hydration, caffeine, especially if I'm gonna workout. Here's a weird one. If I exercise before 8:30 AM, especially if I start exercising when I'm a little bit tired, I get energy that lasts all day. If I wait until my peak of energy, which is mid-morning, 10:00 AM 11:00 AM and I start exercising then, I'm basically exhausted all afternoon. And I don't understand why. I mean, it depends on the\nintensity of the workout, but I like to be done showered and heading into work by 9:00 AM, but I don't always meet that mark. - So you're saying it\ndoesn't affect your energy if you start out with exercising? - I think you can get energy and wake yourself up with\nexercise if you start early, and then that fuels you all day long. I think that if you wait until you're feeling\nat your best to train, sometimes that's detrimental because then in the afternoon when you're doing the\nwork we get paid for, like research, podcasting, et cetera, then oftentimes your brain\nisn't firing as well. - That's interesting. I haven't really rigorously tried that, wake up and just start running or listen. - This is the Jocko thing. And then there's this\nphenomenon called entrainment where if you force yourself to exercise, or eat, or socialize, or view bright light at\na certain time of day for three to seven days in a row, pretty soon there's an\nanticipatory circuit that gets generated. This is why anyone in theory\ncan become a morning person to some degree or another. And this is also a beautiful example of why you wake up before your alarm clock goes off. People wake up and all of a sudden it goes off. It wasn't 'cause it clicked. It's because you have this incredible timekeeping mechanism that exists in sleep. And there's some papers\nthat have been published in the last couple of years, Nature Neuroscience and elsewhere showing that people can answer math\nproblems in their sleep, simple math problems, but math problems nonetheless. This does not mean that if you ask your partner a question in sleep that they're\ngonna answer accurately,. - They might screw up the\nwhole cumulative probability of 20% across multiple months. - All right, listen. - What happened? - What happened? Here's the deal. A few years back, I did a four and a half\nhour after editing, four and a half hour episode on male and female fertility. The entire recording took 11 hours. And by the way, I'm very\nproud of that episode. Many couples have written to me and said they now have children as a consequence of that episode. And my first question is, what were you doing during the episode? But in all seriousness- - We should say that it's\nfour and a half hours. - [Andrew] Yeah. - And they should listen to the episode. It's extremely technical episode. You're nonstop dropping facts and referencing huge number of papers,. It must be exhausting. I don't understand how you can possibly- - It talk about sperm\nhealth, spermatogenesis. It talks about the ovulatory cycle. It talks about things people can do that are considered absolutely\nsupported by science. It talks about some of the things kind of out on the edge a little bit that are a little bit more experimental. It talks about IVF. It talks about ICSI. It talks about all of that. It talks about frequency of pregnancy as a function of age, et cetera. But there's this one\nportion there in the podcast where I'm talking about the probability of a successful pregnancy\nas a function of age. And so there was a clip that was cut in which I was describing\ncumulative probability. And by the way, we've published cumulative probability histograms in many of my laboratories, papers, including one that was in\nNature article in 2018. So we run these all the time. And yes, I know the\ndifference between independent and cumulative probability, just like I do. The way the clip was cut and what I stated unfortunately combined to a pretty great gaff where I said, you're just\nadding percentages to 120%. Unfortunately, my humor\nisn't always so good. And I made a joke. I said, \"120%, but that's a\ndifferent thing altogether.\" What I should have said\nwas, that's impossible and here's how it actually works. But then it continues where I then describe the\ncumulative probability histogram for successful pregnancy. But somewhere in the early portion, I misstated something. I made a math error, which implied I didn't\nunderstand the difference between independent and\ncumulative probability, which I do. And it got picked up and run. And people had a really good laugh with that one at my expense. And so what I did in response to it was rather than just say\neverything I just said now, I just came out online and said, \"Hey, folks, in an episode\ndated this on fertility, I made a math error. Here's the formula for\ncumulative probability, successful pregnancy at that age. Here's the graph.\" I offered it as a teaching\nmoment in two ways. One, for people to understand\ncumulative probability. It was sort of interesting too, a number of people that had come out critiquing the GAF. Like Balaji and folks came out, pointing out that they didn't understand cumulative probability. So there was a lot of posturing. The dog pile, oftentimes, people are quick to dog pile. They didn't understand. But a lot of people did understand, some smart people out there, obviously. I called my dad and he was just laughing. He goes, \"Oh, this is good. This is like the old school way of hammering academics.\" But the point being, it was a teaching moment, given me an opportunity to\nsay, \"Hey, I made a mistake.\" I also made a mistake in another podcast where I did a micron to\nmillimeter conversion or centimeter conversion. And we always correct these\nin the show note captions. We correct them in the audio now. Unfortunately, on YouTube, it's harder to correct. You can't go and edit in segments. We put in the captions. But that was the one teaching moment. If you make a mistake, it's substantive and relate to data, you apologize and correct a mistake, use a teaching moment. The other one was to say, hey, in all the thousands of hours of content we've put out, I'm sure I've made some small errors. I think I once said serotonin\nwhen I meant dopamine. You're going, you're riffing. And it's a reminder to be\ncareful to edit, double check. But the internet usually edits for us and then we go make corrections. But it didn't feel good at first. But ultimately, I can\nlaugh at myself about it. Long ago at Berkeley, when I was TAing my first class, it was a biopsychology\nclass between 1998 or 1999, I was drawing the pituitary gland, which has anterior and a posterior lobe, actually as a medial lobe too. I probably have 5, 600\nstudents in that lecture hall. It was chalkboard and I drew the two lobes of the pituitary. My back was to the audience. I said, \"And so they\njust sort of hang there.\" And everyone just erupted in laughter 'cause it looked like a\nscrotum with two testicles. And I remember thinking like, \"Oh my God, I don't\nthink I can turn around, I can face this.\" Oh, gotta turn around sooner or later. So I turned around and we just all had a big laugh together 'cause it was embarrassing. I'll tell you one thing, though, they never forgot about the\ntwo lobes of the pituitary. - Yeah. And you haven't forgotten\nabout that either. - Right. There's a high salience\nfor these kinds of things. And it also was kind of fun to see how excited people\nget to see people trip. It's like an elite sprinter trips and does something stupid, like runs the opposite\ndirection out the blocks or something like that. I recall one World Cup match years ago, a guy scored against his own team. I think they killed the guy. Do you remember that? - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - Some South American or\nCentral American team. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - And they killed the guy. But yeah, let's look it up. I just said World Cup. Yeah, he was gunned down - Andres Escobar scored\nagainst his own team in 1994 World Cup in the United States, just 27 years old, playing for the Columbia National team. - Yeah. Last name, Escobar. That's a good name. - I think it would protect you. - Listen, so there's some gaffes that get people killed. So how forgiving are\nwe for online mistakes? It's the nature of the mistakes. People were quite gracious about the gaff and some weren't. And it's interesting that we as public health\nscience educators, we'll do long podcasts sometimes and you need to be really careful. What's great is AI allows you to check these things now more readily. So that's cool. And there are ways that it's now gonna be\nmore self-correcting. I think there's a lot of errors out there on the internet and people are finding them and it's cool. Things are getting cleaned up. - Yeah. But mistakes nevertheless will happen. Do you feel the pressure\nof not making mistakes? - Sure. I mean, I try and get things right to the best of my ability. I check with experts. It's kind of interesting when people really don't like something that was said in a podcast. A lot of times, I chuckle 'cause... At Stanford, we have\nsome amazing scientists, but I talk to them, people elsewhere. And it's always interesting to me how I'll get divergent information and then I'll find the\noverlap in the Venn diagram. And I have this question, do I just stay with the\noverlap in the Venn diagram? I did an episode on oral health. I didn't know this until\nI researched that episode, but oral health is critically related to heart health and brain health. That there's a bacteria that causes cavities streptococcus that can make its way into\nother parts of the body through the mouth that\ncan cause serious issues. There's the idea that\nsome forms of dementia, some forms of heart disease\nstart in the mouth, basically. I talked to no fewer than\nfour dentists, dental experts and there was a lot of convergence. I also learned that\nteeth can demineralize, that's the formation of cavities. They can also remineralize. As long as a cavity isn't too deep, it can actually fill itself back in, especially if you provide\nthe right substrates for it. That saliva is this incredible fluid that has all this capacity to remineralize teeth\nprovided the milieu is right. Things like alcohol-based\nmouth wash is killing off some of the critical things you need. It's fascinating. And I put out that episode thinking, oh, well, I'm not a dentist, I'm not an oral health episode, but I talked to a pediatric dentist. There's a terrific one, doctor_staci, S-T-A-C-I, on Instagram, does great content. Talked to some others. And then I just waited for the attack. I was like, \"Here we go,\" and it didn't come. And dentists were thanking me. I was like, \"Whoa.\" - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - That's a rare thing. More often than not, if I do an episode about, say, psilocybin or MDMA, you get some people liking it, or ADHD and the drugs for ADHD. We did a whole episode\non the Ritalin, Vyvanse, Adderall stuff. You get people saying, \"Thank you, I prescribed this to my kid and it really helps,\" but they're private about\nthe fact that they do it because they catch so much\nattack from other people. So I like to find the\ncenter of mass report that, try and make it as clear as possible. And then I know that there's some stuff where I'm gonna catch. What's frustrating for\nme is when I see claims that I'm like against\nfluoridization of water, which I'm not. We talked about the benefits of fluoride. It builds hyper strong\nbonds within the teeth. I went and looked at some of\nliterally the crystal sruc... Excuse me, not the crystal structure, but essentially like micron and sub-micron structure\nof teeth is incredible and where fluoride can get in there and form these super strong bonds. And you can also form them with\nthings like hydroxyapatite. And why is there fluoride in water? Well, it's the best. Okay. You say some things that are interesting, but then somehow it gets turned into like you're against fluoridization, which I'm not, or I've been accused of\nbeing against sunscreen. I wear mineral-based sunscreen on my face. I don't want to get skin cancer, or I use a physical barrier. There is a cohort of\npeople out there that think that all sunscreens are bad. I'm not one of them. I'm not what's called a sunscreen truther. But then you get attacked\nfor like if you... So we're talking about\nthere are certain sunscreens that are problematic. And Rhonda Patrick's now starting to get vocal about this. And so there's certain\ntopics, it's interesting, for which you have to listen carefully to what somebody is saying, but there's a lumper or lumping as opposed to splitting of what health educators say. With politics, there's this urgency to just put people into a camp of expert versus\nrenegade or something. And it's not like that. It's just not like that. So the short answer is I really strive, really strive to get things right, but I know that I'm gonna\npiss certain people off. And you've taught me and Joe's taught me and other\npodcasters have taught me that if you worry too much about it, then you aren't gonna get the\nnewest information out there. Like peptides, there's\nvery little human data, unless you're talking\nabout Vyleesi or the stuff in the alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating\nhormone stuff which are prescribed for female libido to enhance female libido or Sermorelin, which is for certain growth\nhormone deficiencies. With rare exception, there's very little human data, but people are still super interested in, a lot of people are taking\nand doing these things, so you wanna get the information out. - Do you try to not just\nlook at the science, but research what the various\ncommunities are talking about, like maybe research the conspiracy theorists\nare talking about, just so you know all the armies that are going to be\nattacking your castle? - Yes. So like for instance, there's a community of\npeople online that believe that if you consume seed oils or something that setting\nup your skin for sunburn and if you don't. There's all these theories. So I like to know what the theories are. I like to know what the extremes are, but I also like to know what\nthe standard conversation is. But there's generally more\nagreement than disagreement. I think where I've been kind of bullish actually are supplements. People go, \"Oh supplements.\" Well, there's food supplements\nlike a protein powder, which is different than a vitamin. And then they are compounds. There are compounds\nthat have real benefit, but people get very nervous about the fact that they're not regulated. But some of them are\nvetted with for potency and for safety with\nmore rigor than others. And it's interesting to see how people who take care of themselves and put a lot of work into\nthat are often attacked. That's been interesting. Also, one of the most controversial topics nowadays is Ozempic, Mounjaro. I'm very middle of the road on this. I don't understand why the quote, unquote, \"health wellness community\"\nis so against these things. I also don't understand why they have to be looked at as the only route. For some people, they've really helped them lose weight. And yes, there can be some muscle loss and other lean body loss, but that can be offset\nwith resistance training. They've helped a lot of people. And other people are like, \"No, this stuff is terrible.\" I think the most interesting\nthing about Ozempic, Mounjaro is that they're\nin the GLP-1 pathway, glucagon-like peptide 1. And it was discovered in Gila monsters, which is a lizard, basically. Now, the entomologist will dive on me. It's a big lizard-looking thing that doesn't eat very often. And they figured out\nthat there's this peptide that allows it to curb its own appetite at the level of the brain and the gut. And it has a lot of homology to sequence hemology to\nwhat we now call GLP-1. So I love anytime there's\nanimal biology links to cool human biology links to a drug that's powerful that can help people with\nobesity and type 2 diabetes. And there's evidence that can\neven curb some addictions. Those are newer data. But I don't see as either or. In fact, I've been a little\nbit disappointed at the way that the, whatever you wanna\ncall it, health wellness, biohacking community has\nslammed on Ozempic, Mounjaro. They're like, \"Just get out and run.\" Listen, there are people who are carrying substantial amounts of weight that running could injure them. They get on these drugs\nand they can improve. Hopefully, they're also\ndoing resistance training and eating better, and then you're bringing\nall the elements together. - Well, why do you think\nthe criticism is happening? Is it that Ozempic became super popular so people are misusing\nit or that kind of thing? - No, I think what it\nis, is that people think if it's a pharmaceutical, it's bad. - Yeah. - Or if it's a supplement, it's bad depending on\nwhich camp they're in. And wouldn't it be wonderful to kind of fill in the\ngap between this divide? What I would like to see in politics and in health is neither right nor left, but what we can just call a\nleague of reasonable people that looks at things on\nan issue by issue basis and fills in the center 'cause I think most people are in the, I don't wanna say, center in a political way, but I think most people are reasonable. They want to be reasonable, but that's not what sells clicks. That's not what drives interest. I look at issue by\nissue, person by person. I don't like ingroup,\noutgroup stuff I never have. I've got friends from all walks of life. I said this on other podcasts and it always sounds like\na political statement. The push towards polarization, it's so frustrating. If there's one thing that's discouraging to me as I get older each year, I'm like, \"Wow, are we ever gonna get out of this polarization?\" Speaking of which, how are you gonna vote for\nthe presidential election? - I'm still trying to figure out how to interview the people\ninvolved and do it well. - What do you think the role of podcast is gonna be\nin this year's election? I would love long form conversations to happen with the candidates. I think it's gonna be huge. I would love Trump to go on Rogan. I'm embarrassed to say this, but I honestly would love to see Joe Biden go on Joe Rogan also. - I would imagine that both would go on, but separately. - Separately is, I think, a debate. Joe does debates, but I think Joe at his best, this one-on-one conversation\nreally intimate. I just wish that Joe Biden would actually\ndo long form conversations. - I thought he had done a... wasn't he? I think it was on Jay Shetty's podcast. - He did Jay Shetty. He did a few. But when I mean long form, I mean really long form, like two, three hours and more relaxed, it was much more orchestrated. Because what happens when the interview's a\nlittle bit too short, it becomes into this\ngeneric political type of NBC, CNN type of interview. You get a set of questions and you don't get to\nreally feel the human, expose the human to the light in... The full, we talked about the shadow, the good, the bad, and the ugly. So I think there's something magical about two, three, four hours. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - But it doesn't have to be that long. But it has to have that feeling to it where there's not people standing around and everybody's nervous, and you're going to be strictly sticking to the question answer type of feel, but just shooting shit, which Rogan is the best by\nfar in the world at that. - I don't think people really appreciate how skilled he is at what he does. I mean, the three or\nfour podcasts per week plus the UFC announcing, plus\ncomedy tours, and stadiums, plus doing comedy shows\nin the middle of the week, plus a husband, and a father,\nand a friend, and jujitsu, the guy's got like\nsuperhuman levels of output. I agree that long form conversation is a whole other business. And I think that people want and deserve to know the\npeople that are running for office in a different way and to really get to know them. Well, listen, I guess you... I mean, is it clear that\nhe's gonna do jail time or maybe he gets away with fine? - No, I don't think I'm- - 'Cause I was gonna say, I mean, does that mean\nyou're gonna be podcasting from jail?\n- In prison, yeah. In fact, I'm going to figure out how to commit a crime so I can get in prison with- - Please don't, please don't. I'm sure they have visitors. - Right. - That just doesn't feel an authentic way to get the interview. But yeah, I understand. - You wouldn't be able to wear that suit. You'd be wearing a different suit. - That's true. - Yeah.\n- That's true. - It's gonna be interesting. I'm not just saying this 'cause you're my friend, but you would do a marvelous job. I think you should sit down with all of them separately to keep it civil and see what happens. Here's one thing that I found really interesting in this whole political landscape. When I'm in Los Angeles, I often get invited to these... They're not dinners, but gatherings where a local bunch of podcasters will come together, but a lot of people from\nthe entertainment industry, big agencies, big tech, like big, big tech, many of the people have\nbeen on this podcast. And they'll host a discussion or debate. And what you find, if you look around the room and you talk to people, is that about half the people in the room are very left-leaning and very outspoken about that. And they'll tell you exactly who they wanna see win\nthe presidential race. And the other half will tell you that they're for the other side. A lot of people that people\nassume are on one side of the aisle or the other are\nin the exact opposite side. Now, some people are very\nopen about who they're for, but it's been very interesting to see how when you get people one-on-one, they're telling you they\nwant X candidate to win or Y candidate to win. And sometimes I'm like, \"Really? I can't believe it. Like, you?\" Like, yep. And so it's what people think about people's political\nleaning is often exactly wrong. And that's been eye-opening for me. And I've seen that in\nuniversity campuses too. It's gonna be really, really interesting to see what happens in November. - In addition to that, as you said, most people are close to the center despite what Twitter makes it seem like. Most people, whether that's\ncenter left to center right, they're kind of close to the center. - Yeah. I mean, to me, the most\ninteresting question, who is gonna be the next big\ncandidate in years to come? Who's that going to be? Right now, I don't see or know of that person. Who's it gonna be? - Yeah, the young promising candidates., we're not seeing them. Another way to ask that question, who would want to be? - Well, that's the issue, right? Who wants to live in\nthis 12-hour news cycle where you're just trying\nto dunk on the other team so that nobody notices that you fucked up? That's not only not fun or interesting, it also is just like... It's gotta be psychosis-inducing\nat some point. And I think that, God willing, we're gonna... Some young guy or woman is on this and refuses to back down and was just determined to be president, and we'll make it happen. I don't even know who the\nviable candidates are. Maybe you, Lex. We should ask Saagar. Saagar would know. - Yeah, yeah. Maybe Saagar himself. - Saagar's show is awesome. - Yeah, it is.\n- He and Crystal do a great thing. - He's incredible. - Especially since they have somewhat divergent opinions on things, that's what makes it so cool. - He's great. He looks great in the\nsuit, looks real sexy. - He's taking real good care of himself. I think he's getting married soon. Congratulations, Saagar. Forgive me for not remembering\nyour future wife's name. - He won my heart by giving me a biography\nof Hitler as a present. - That's what he gave you? - Yeah. - I gave you a hatchet\nwith a poem inscribed- - That just shows the\nfundamental difference- - With a poem inscribed in it, which was pretty damn good. I realized everything we bring up on the screen is really depressing, like the soccer player getting killed. Can we bring up something happy? - Sure. Let's go to Nature Is Metal Instagram. - That's pretty intense. We actually did a collaborative\npost on a shark thing. - Really? - [Andrew] Yeah. - What kind of shark thing? - So to generate the fear VR stimulus from my lab in 20,... Was it? Yeah, 2016. We went down to Guadalupe\nIsland off the coast of Mexico. Me and a guy named Michael Muller, who's a very famous portrait photographer, but also takes photos of sharks. And we used 360 video to build VR of great white sharks. Brought it back to the lab. We published that study\nin Current Biology. In 2017, went back down there. That was the year that I exited the cage that you lower the cage with the crane. And that year, I exited the cage. I had a whole mess with air failure the day I was breathing from a hookah line while in the cage. I had no scuba on. Divers were out. The thing got boa constricted up, and I had an air failure. And I had to actually share air and it was a whole mess. Story for another time. But the next day, because I didn't want to get PTSD and it was pretty scary, the next day, I cage exited with some other divers. And it turns out with these great white\nsharks in Guadalupe, the water's very clear and\nyou can swim toward them and then they'll veer off\nyou if you swim toward them. Otherwise, they see you as prey. Well, in the evening, you've brought all the cages up and you're hopefully all alive. And we were hanging out fishing for tuna. One of the crew on board\nhad a line in the water and was fishing for tuna for dinner. And a shark took the tuna off the line. It's a very dramatic take. And you can see just absolute size of these great white sharks. The waters there are filled with them. That's the one. So this video, just the Neuralink link was\nshot by Matt MacDougall, who is the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink. There it is. Now, believe it or not, it looks like it missed, like it didn't get the fish. It actually just cut that\nthing like a band saw. So I'm up on the deck with Matt. Yeah. And so when you look at it from the side, you really get a sense of the girth of this fricking thing. So as it comes up, if you... The size of that thing. And they move through the water with such speed, just a couple. So when you're in the cage and the cage is lowered\ndown below the surface, they're going around, you're not allowed to\nchum the water there. Some people do it. And then when you cage exit, they're like, well, what\nare you doing out here? And then you swim toward them, they veer off. But what's interesting is that if you look at how they\nmove through the water, all it takes for one of\nthese great white sharks when it sees a tuna or something it wants to eat\nis like two flicks of the tail and becomes like a missile. It's just unbelievable economy of effort. And Ocean Ramsey who is, in my opinion, the greatest of all\ncage exit shark divers, this woman who dove with\nenormous great white sharks, she really understands their behavior when they're aggressive, when they're not gonna be aggressive. She and her husband, Juan, I believe his name is, they understand how\nthe tiger sharks differ from the great white sharks? We were down there basically\nnot understanding any of this. We never should have been there. And actually, the air\nfailure the day before plus cage exiting the next day, I told myself after coming\nup from the cage exit, \"That's it. I'm no longer taking risks with my life. I want to live.\" Got back across the\nborder a couple days later and I was like, \"That's it. I don't take risks with\nmy life any longer.\" But yeah, MacDougall, Matt\nMacDougall shot that video and then it went, quote, unquote, \"viral\" through the Nature is Metal. We passed them that video. - Actually, I saw a video where an instructor was\nexplaining how to behave with a shark in the water and that you don't wanna be swimming away because then you're acting like a prey. - [Andrew] That's right. - And then you wanna be\nacting like a predator by looking at it and swimming towards it. - [Andrew] Right, towards them and they'll bank off. Now, if you don't see them, they're ambush predators. You're swimming in the surface. - [Lex] Apparently, if they get close, you should just guide\nthem away by grabbing them and moving them away. - Some people will actually roll them, but if they're coming in full speedy, you're not gonna roll the shark. But here we are back to dark stuff again. I like the shark attack map and the shark attack map shows that Northern California, there were a couple, actually. A guy's head got taken off. He was swimming north of San Francisco. There's been a couple\nof northern California that was really tragic, but most of them are in\nFlorida and Australia. - Florida. - The Surfrider Foundation\nshark attack map. There it is. They have a great map. - There you go. - So they look like- - Beautiful. - They have all the scars on them. So if you zoom in on... I mean, look at this. If you go to the North America. - Look at skulls. - Yeah, where there are deadly attacks, but in Northern California, sadly. This is really tragic. If you zoom in on this one. I read about this. This guy, if you can click the link, 52-year-old male, he was in chest high water. This is just tragic. I feel so sad for him and his family. Three members of the party chose to go in. Njai was in his chest-high water, 25 to 50 yards from shore. Breached water seized\nhis head and that was it. So it does happen. It's very infrequent. If you don't go in the ocean, it's a very, very, very low probability. - But if it doesn't happen, six times in a row. - 120% chance. - Yeah. Who do you think wins? a salt water crocodile or a shark? - Okay. I do not like saltwater crocodiles. They scare me to no end. Muller, Michael Muller, who dove all over the world, he sent me a picture of him diving with saltwater crocs in Cuba. It was a smaller one. But goodness, have you seen the size of some of those saltwater crocs? - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm thinking the sharks are so agile. They're amazing. They've head cammed one or bodycammed one moving\nthrough the kelp bed. They're so agile moving through the water. Up at the surface, the camera's looking at the surface. And you just realize if you're out there, and you're swimming, and you get hit by a shark, you're not gonna- - I was gonna talk shit and say that a salty\nhas way more bite force. But according to the internet, recently, data indicates that\nthe shark has a stronger bite. So I was assuming that a crocodile would've\na stronger bite force and therefore agility doesn't matter, but apparently a shark. - Yeah. And turning one of those\nbig salty is probably not that turning around. It's like a battleship. I mean, those sharks are unbelievable. They hit from all sorts. Oh, and they do this thing. We saw this. You're out of the cage or in the cage, and you'll look at one. And you'll see its eye kind\nof like looking at you. They can't really fovea, but they'll look at you. And you're tracking it. And then you'll look down, and you'll realize that\none's coming at you. They're ambush preyers. They're working together. It's fascinating. - I like how you know\nthat they can't fovea you. - [Andrew] Right. - You're already considering\nthe vision system there. It's a very primitive system. - Very primitive eyes\non the side of the head. Their vision is decent enough. They're mostly obviously sensing things with their electro sensing in the water, but also olfaction. Yeah, I spend far too\nmuch time thinking about and learning about the visual systems of different animals. If you get me going on this, we'll be here all night. - See, this is why I\nhave the smuggler on too. I saw this in a store and I got it 'cause this is from a shark. - Goodness. I can't say I ever saw\none with teeth this big, but it's beautiful. It's beautiful. Probably your blood pressure just goes and you don't feel feel a thing. - Yeah. It's not gonna... - Before we went down for the cage exit, a guy in our crew, Pat Dossett, very experienced diver, asked one of the South\nAfrican divers that, \"What's the contingency plan if somebody catches a bite?\" And they were like... He was like every man for himself. And they're like, basically saying like, \"If somebody catches a bite, that's it.\" Anyway, I thought we were\ngonna bring up something happy. - Oh, that is happy. Well, nature is beautiful. - Yeah, nature is beautiful. We lived. There are happy things you brought up. Nature is Metal. See, this is the difference between Russian Americans and Americans. It's like maybe this\nis actually a good time to bring up your ayahuasca journey. I've never done ayahuasca, but I'm curious about it. I'm also curious about ibogaine, iboga, but you told me that you did ayahuasca and that for you, it wasn't the dark, scary ride that it is for everybody else. - Yeah, it was an incredible\nexperience for me. I did it twice, actually. - And have you done high dose psilocybin? - Never, no. I just did small dose\npsilocybin a couple times. So I was nervous about it. I was very- - Understandably so. I've done high dose psilocybin. It's terrifying. But I've always gotten\nsomething very useful out of it. - So I mean, I was nervous about whatever demons\nmight hide in the shadow, in the Jungian shadow. I was nervous. But I think it turns out... I don't know what the\nlesson is to draw from that, but my experience- - Be born Russian. - It must be the Russian thing. I mean, there's also\nsomething to the jungle there. It strips away all the bullshit of life and you're just there. I forgot the outside civilization exists. I forgot time because when you don't have your phone, you don't have meetings\nor calls or whatever, you lose a sense of time. The sun comes up, the sun comes down. - That's the fundamental biological timer. Every mammalian species\nhas a short wavelength. So you think like blue UV type, but like absorbing cone and a longer wavelength absorbing cone. And it does this interesting subtraction to designate when it's morning and evening because when the sun is low in the sky, you've got short wavelength\nand long wavelength light. When you look at a sunrise, it's got blues and yellows,\norange and yellows. You look in the evening, reds, orange, and blues. And in the middle of the day, it's full spectrum light. Now, it's always full spectrum light. But because of some atmospheric elements and because of the low solar angle, that difference between\nthe different wavelength of light is the fundamental signal that the neurons in your\neye pay attention to and signal to your circadian\ntimekeeping mechanism. At the core of our brain and the suprachiasmatic nucleus, we are wired to be entrained to the rising and setting of the sun. That's the biological timer. Which makes perfect sense because obviously as the\nplanets spin and revolve. - I also wonder how that is affected. In the rainforest, the sun is not visible often, so you're under the cover of the trees. So maybe that affects- - Well, there are social rhythms. There are feeding rhythms. sometimes in terms of some\nspecies will signal the timing of activity of other species, but yet getting out from\nthe canopy is critical. Of course, even under the\ncanopy during the daytime, there's far more photons than at night. This is always when I'm telling people to get sunlight in their\neyes in the morning and in the evening. People say, \"There's no\nsunlight this time here,\" I'm like, \"Go outside on\na really overcast day. It's far brighter than it is at night.\" So there's still lots of sunlight, even if you can't see\nthe sun as an object. I love time perception shifts. And you mentioned that in the jungle, it's linked to the rising\nand setting of the sun. You also mentioned that on ayahuasca, you zoomed out from the earth. These are like, to me, the\nmost interesting aspects of having a human brain as\nopposed to another brain. Of course, I've only\never had a human brain, which is that you can consciously set your time domain window. We can be focused here. we can be focused on all of Austin, or we can be focused on the entire planet. You can make those choices consciously. But in the time domain, it's hard. Different activities\nbring us into fine slicing or more broad bending of time depending on what we're doing, programming, or exercising,\nor researching, or podcasting. But just how unbelievably\nfluid the human brain is in terms of the aperture\nof the time space window of our cognition and of our experience. I feel like this is perhaps one of the more valuable tools\nthat we have access to that we don't really leverage\nas much as we should, which is when things are really hard, you need to zoom out and see it as one element\nwithin your whole lifespan, and that there's more to come. I mean, people commit suicide because they can't see beyond\nthe time domain they're in, or they think it's gonna go on forever. When we're happy, we rarely think this\nis gonna last forever, which is an interesting\ncontrast in its own right. But I think that psychedelics, while I have very little\nexperience with them, I have some and it sounds like they're\njust a very interesting window into the different apertures. - Well, how To surf that\nwave is probably a skill. One of the things I was prepared for and I think is important is not to resist. - [Andrew] Hmm. - I think I understand what it means to resist a thing, a powerful wave, and it's not going to be good. So you have to be able to surface it. So I was ready for that\nto relax through it. And maybe because I'm quite good at that from knowing how to relax and all kinds of disciplines, playing piano and guitar\nwhen I was super young And then through jujitsu, knowing the value of relaxation and through all kinds of sports to be able to relax the body fully, just accept whatever happens to you. That process is probably why it was a very Positive\nexperience for me. - Do you have any interest in iboga? I'm very interested in ibogaine, iboga. There's a colleague of mine and researcher at\nStanford, Nolan Williams, who's been doing some\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation and brain imaging on people\nwho have taken ibogaine. Ibogaine, as I understand, it gives a 22-hour psychedelic journey where no hallucinations with eyes open, but you close your eyes and you get a very high resolution image of actual events that\nhappened in your life, but then you have agency\nwithin those movies. I think you have to be of healthy heart to be able to do it. I think you have to be\non a heart rate monitor. It's not trivial. It's not like these other psychedelics. But there's a wonderful group\ncalled Veteran Solutions that has used iboga combined\nwith some other psychedelics in the veterans community to great success for things like PTSD. And it's a group I've\nreally tried to support in any way that I can, mainly by being vocal about\nthe great work they're doing. But you hear incredible stories of people who are just like near cratered in their life or zombied by PTSD and other things post-war, get back a lightness or achieve\na lightness and a clarity that they didn't feel they had. So I'm very curious about these compounds. The state of Kentucky, we should check this, but I believe it's taken money from the opioid crisis\nsettlement for ibogaine research. I mean, so this is like no longer... Yes, if you look here. Let's see. Did they do it? Oh no, oh no.\n- No. - They backed away. - Kentucky backs away for the plan to fund opioid treatment research. - They're going to use\nthe money to treat opioid, Now, officials are backing off. 50 billion, what, is on its\nway over the coming years. $50 billion. - $50 billion is on its way to state and local government\nover the coming years. The pool of funding comes\nfrom multiple legal statements with pharmaceutical companies that profited from manufacturing or selling opioid painkillers. - Kentucky has some of the highest number of deaths from the opioid. So they were going to do\npsychedelic research with ibogaine, supporting research on illegal folks. Psychedelic drug called ibogaine. Well, I guess they backed away from it. Well, sooner or later, we'll get some happy\nnews up on the internet during this episode. - I don't know what I'm talking about, the shark and the crocodile fighting. - Yeah, yeah, that's true. That's true. And you survived the jungle. - [Lex] Well, that's the thing. - I was writing to you on\nWhatsApp multiple times 'cause I was gonna put it on the internet. Are you okay? And if you're alive, and then I was gonna\njust put it to Twitter, just like he's alive. But then, of course, you're\nfar too classy for that. So you just came back alive. - Well, jungle or not, one of the lessons is also when you hear the call for adventure, just fucking do it. - I was gonna ask you, it's kind of silly question, but give me a small fraction of things on your bucket list. - Bucket list. - [Andrew] Yeah. - Go to Mars. Yeah, what's the status of that? - I don't know. I'm being patient about the whole thing. - Red Planet ran that\ncartoon of you, guys. That one's pretty funny. - [Lex] That's true, actually. - That one was pretty funny. One where Goggins is already up there, that's a funny one. - Probably also true. I would love to die in Mars. I just love humanity\nreaching onto the stars and doing this a bold adventure and taking big risks and exploring. I love exploration. - What about seeing\ndifferent animal species? I'm a huge fan of this guy, Joel Sartore, where he has this photo arc project where he takes portraits of\nall these different animals. If people aren't already\nfollowing him on Instagram, he's doing some really important work. This guy's Instagram is amazing. - Portraits available. - Well, look at these portraits. The amount of, I don't\nwanna say personality 'cause we don't wanna\nproject anything onto them, but like the eyes, and he'll occasionally put them... This is a little owl. I delight in things like this. I've got some content coming on animals and animal neuroscience and eyes. - [Lex] And dogs or all kinds of things. - All animals. And I'm very interested in kids content that incorporates animals, so we have some things brewing there. I could look at this kind\nof stuff all day long. Look at that bat. People think about bats as\nkind of little flickering, a little annoying disease things. But look how beautiful\nthat little sucker is. - How's your podcast with\nthe Cookie Monster coming? - Oh yeah. We've been in discussions with Cookie. Can't say too much about that, but Cookie Monster\nembodies dopamine, right? Cookie Monster wants cookie, right? Wants cookie right now. It was that one tweet Cookie Monster, \"I bounce because cookies\ncome from all directions.\" It is just embodying the\ndesire for something, which is an incredible\naspect of ourselves. The other one is, do you remember a little while ago, Elmo put out a tweet, \"Hey, how's everyone doing out there?\" And it went viral. And the Surgeon General of the United States had been talking about the loneliness crisis. He came on the podcast. A lot of people have been talking about problems with loneliness, mental health issues with loneliness. Elmo puts out a tweet, \"Hey, how's everyone doing out there?\" And everyone gravitates toward it. The different \"Sesame Street\"\ncharacters really embody the different kind of aspects of self through very narrow neural\ncircuit perspective. Snuffleupagus is shy and Oscar the Grouch, Grouchy, right? And the Count 1, the 2. - [Lex] The archetypes of- - [Andrew] Yeah. - [Lex] The archetypes is\nvery Jungian once again. - Yeah. And I think that the creators of \"Sesame Street\" clearly\neither understand that or it's an unconscious genius to that. So yeah, there are some things brewing on conversations with\n\"Sesame Street\" characters. I know you'd like to\ntalk to Vladimir Putin. I'd like to talk to Cookie Monster. It illustrates the differences in our sophistication or something, illustrates a lot. Yeah, illustrates a lot. I love animation. So I'm not anime, that's not my thing, but animation. So I'm very interested\nin the use of animation to get science content across. So there are a bunch of things brewing. But anyway, I delight in Sartore's work. There's a conservation\naspect to it as well. But I think that mostly wanna thank you for finally putting up something where something's not being\nkilled or some sad outcome. - These are all really positive. - They're really cool. They're really cool. And every once in a while... Look at that mountain lion. But I also like to look at these and some of them remind\nme of certain people. So let's just scroll through. Like for instance, I\nthink when we don't try and process it too much, so, like, okay... Look at this cat, this civic cat. - Amazing. - I feel like this is someone I met once as a young kid.\n- Curiosity. - Curiosity and a playfulness. - Carnivore. - Carnivore, frontalized eyes. - Found in forested areas. - Right. So then you go down. This beautiful fish. - [Lex] Neon pink. - Right. It reminds you of some of\nthe influencers you see on Instagram, except this one's natural. Just kidding. Let's see. - No filter. No filter. - Yeah. Let's see. I feel like- - Bears. I'm a big fan of bears. - Yeah, bears are beautiful. This one kind of reminds\nme of you a little bit. There's like a stoic\nnature to it, a curiosity. So you can kind of feel\nlike the essence of animals. You don't even have to do\npsychedelics to get there. - Oh, look at that. He's like the behind the scenes of how it's actually- - [Andrew] Yeah. And then there's- - Wow.\n- Yeah. - Yeah. In the jungle, the diversity of life was also stark. From a scientific perspective, just the fact that most of those species are not\nidentified was fascinating. - [Andrew] Right. - Every little insect\nis a kind of discovery. - Right. I mean, one of the reasons\nI love New York City so much just by its problems at times is that everywhere you look, there's life. It's like a tropical reef. If you've ever done scuba\ndiving or snorkeling, you look on a tropical reef and it's like there's some\nlittle crab working on something and everywhere you look, there's life. In the Bay Area, if you go scuba diving or snorkeling, it's like a kelp bed. The Bay Area is like a kelp bed. Every once in a while, some big fish goes by. It's like a big IPO. But most of the time, not a whole lot happens. Actually, the Bay Area, t's interesting as I've\nbeen going back there more and more recently. There are really cool\nlittle subculture starting to pop up again. - [Lex] Nice. - There's incredible skateboarding. The GX1000 guys are these\nguys that bomb down hills. They're nuts. They're just going like- - So just speed, not tricks. You gotta see GX1000, these guys going downhill\nin San Francisco. They are wild. And occasionally, unfortunately, occasionally someone\nwill get hit by a car. But GX1000. Look, into intersections, they have spotters. You can see someone there. - Oh, I see. There's a- - Into traffic. Yeah, into traffic. - [Lex] In San Francisco. - Yeah, this is crazy. This is unbelievable. They're just wild. But in any case. - What's on your bucket\nlist that you haven't done? - Well, I'm working on a book. So I'm actually going to head to a cabin for a couple weeks and write, which I've never done. People talk about doing this, but I'm gonna do that. I'm excited for that. Just the mental space of\nreally dropping into writing. - Like Jack Nicholson\nin \"The Shining\" cabin. - Let's hope not. Let's hope not.\n- Okay. - I mean, I only started\ndoing public facing anything, posting on Instagram in 2019, but I used to head up to Gualala on the northern coast of California, sometimes by myself to\na little cabin there and spend a weekend by myself and just read and write\npapers and things like that. I used to do that all the time. I miss that. So some of that. I'm trying to spend a bit more time with my relatives in Argentina, relatives on the east coast, see my parents more. They're in good health, thankfully. I wanna get married and have a family. That's an important priority and putting a lot of work in there. - Yeah, that's a big one. - Yeah, yeah.\n- That's a big one. - Putting a lot of work\ninto the runway on that. - What's your advice\nfor people about that? Or give advice to yourself about how to find love in this world, how to find, how to build a family and get there. - And then I'll listen to it someday and see if I hit the marks. Yeah, well, obviously\npick the right partner, but also do the work on\nyourself, know yourself. The oracle know thyself. Listen, I have a friend, he's a new friend, but he's a friend who I met for a meal. He's a very, very well\nknown actor overseas. And his stuff has made it over here. And we become friends, and we went to lunch. And we were talking about\nwork and being public facing and all this kind of thing. And then I said, \"You have kids, right?\" And he says he has four kids. I was like, \"Oh yeah, I see\nyour posts with the kids, you seem really happy.\" He just looked at me, leaned in and he said, \"It's the best gift you'll ever give yourself.\" And he also said, \"And pick your partner, the mother of your kids very carefully.\" So that's excellent advice\ncoming from somebody who's very successful in work and family. So that's the only thing I can pass along. We hear this from friends of ours as well, but kids are amazing and family's amazing and that's the different people. All these people who\nwant to like be immortal and live to be 200 or something. There's also the old fashioned way of having children that live on and evolve a new legacy, but they have half your DNA. So that's exciting. - Yeah. I think you make an amazing dad. - [Andrew] Thank you. - It seems like a fun thing. I've also gotten the advice from friends who are super high performing\nand have a lot of kids and they'll say, \"Just don't overthink it. Start having kids.\" Let's go. - Well, the chaos of\nkids can either bury you or it can give you energy. But I grew up in a big pack of boys always doing\nwild and crazy things. And so that kind of energy is great. And if it's not a big pack of wild boys and you have daughters, and they can be different\nform of chaos sometimes, same form of chaos. How many kids do you think you want? - Mm. You know, it's either two or five. - Very different dynamics. You're one of two, right? You have a brother? - Yep.\n- Yeah. - I mean, I'm very close with my sister. I couldn't imagine having another sibling 'cause there's so much richness there. We talk almost every day or three, four times a week. Sometimes just briefly. But we're tight we really look out for one another. She's an amazing person, like truly an amazing person and has raised her\ndaughter in an amazing way. My niece is like gonna head to college in a year or two. My sister's done an amazing job and her dad's done a a great job too. They both really put a lot\ninto the family aspect. - Got a chance to spend time with a really amazing person in Peru, in the Amazon jungle. And he is one of 20 kids. - [Andrew] Wow. - It's mostly guys. So it's just a lot of brothers\nand I think two sisters. - Wow. I just had Jonathan Haidt on the podcast, the guy who's talking the anxious generation causing the American mind. He's great. But he was saying that in order to keep kids healthy, they need to not be on social media or have smartphones until they're 16. I've actually been thinking a lot about getting a bunch of friends onto neighboring properties. Everyone talks about this. Not creating a commune\nor anything like that. I think Jonathan's right, more or less our brain wiring does best when we raised in small\nvillage type environments where kids can forage the\nwhole free range kids idea. And I grew up skateboarding and building forts and dirt\nclawed wars and all that stuff. It would be so strange to have a childhood without that. - Yeah. And I think more and more as we wake up to the negative aspects of digital interaction, we'll put more and more value to in-person interaction. - I mean, it's cool to see, for instance, kids in New York City just kind of moving around the city with so\nmuch sense of agency. It's really, really cool. The suburbs where I grew up, as soon as we could get out, take the seven 7F bus up to San Francisco and hang out with wild ones, while there were dangers, I mean, we couldn't wait\nto get outta the suburbs. The moment that forts and dirt clawed wars and stuff didn't cut it, we just wanted into the city. So bucket list, I will probably move to a major city, not Los Angeles or San Francisco, in the next few years. New York City, potentially. - Those are all such different\nflavors of experiences. - Yeah. So I'd love to live in\nNew York City for a while. I've always wanted to do that. And I will do that. I've always wanted to also have a place in a very rural area. So Colorado, Montana are\nhigh on my list right now. And to be able to pivot back and forth between the two would be great, just for such different experiences. And also, I like a very physical life. So the idea of getting up with the sun in a Montana or Colorado type environment. And I've been putting some effort towards finding a spot for that. And New York City to me, I know it's got its issues and people say it wasn't what it was. Okay, I get it. But listen, I've never lived there. So for me, it'd be entirely new. Shul seems full of life. - There is an energy to that city and he represents that. I mean there's- - [Andrew] Yeah. - And the full diversity of weird that is represented in\nNew York City is great. - Yeah, he walked down the street, there's like a person with\nlike a cat on their head and no one gives a shit. - [Lex] Yeah, that's great. - San Francisco used to be like that. The joke was, like, you have to be naked and on fire in San Francisco before someone takes it, but now it's changed. But again, recently I've\nnoticed that San Francisco, it's not just about the skateboarders, there's some community\nhouses of people in tech that are super interesting. There's some community\nhousing of people not in tech that I've learned about and known people have lived there. It's cool. There's stuff happening\nin these cities that's new and different. I mean, that's what youth is for. They're supposed to evolve things out. - So amidst all that, you still have to get shit done. I've been really obsessed\nwith tracking time recently, like making sure I have daily activities. I have habits that I'm maintaining. And I'm very religious about\nmaking sure I get shit done. - Do use an app or something like that? - No, just Google Sheets. So basically a spreadsheet\nand I'm tracking daily. And I write scripts that\nwhenever I achieve a goal, it glows green. - Yeah. Do you track your workouts and all that kind of stuff too? - No. Just the fact that I got the workout done. - [Andrew] Yeah. - So it's a check mark thing. So I'm really, really big\non making sure I do a thing. It doesn't matter how long it is. So I have a rule for myself\nthat I do a set of tasks for at least five minutes every day. And it turns out that many of them, I do way longer, but even just doing it, I have to do it every day. And there's currently 11 of them. And it's just a thing, like one of them is playing\nguitar, for example. So do you do that kind of stuff? Do you do daily habits? - Yeah, I do. I wake up. If I don't feel I slept enough. I do this non-sleep deep\nrest yoga nidra thing that I talked about a bunch. We actually released a few of those tracks as audio tracks on Spotify. 10-minute, 20-minute ones\nputs me back into a state that feels like sleep and I feel very rested. Actually, Matt Walker and\nI are gonna run a study. He's just submitted the\nIRB to run a study on NSDR and what it's actually doing to the brain. There's some evidence of\nincreases in dopamine, et cetera, but those are older studies, still cool studies. So I'll do that. Get up hydrate. And if I've got my act together, I punch some caffeine down, like some Mateína, some coffee, maybe another Mateína, and resistance train three days a week, run three days a week. And then take one day off. And like to be done by 8:39. And then I want to get\ninto some real work. I actually have a sticky\nnote on my computer. It's just like reminding\nme how good it feels to accomplish some real work. And then I go into it right now. It's the book writing,\nresearching a podcast, and just fight tooth and nail to stay off social media, text message, WhatsApp, YouTube, all that. Get something done. - How long can you go? Can you go three hours just deep focus? - If I hit a groove, yeah, 90 minutes to three hours if I'm really in a groove. - That's tough. For me, I start the day... Actually, that's why I'm\nafraid I'd really prize that those morning hours\nI start with the work. - [Andrew] Yeah. - I'm trying to hit the\nfour-hour mark of deep focus. - Great. I love it. - And it often- - Report, report. - Yeah, I'm really, really faithfully... - [Andrew] Yeah. - It's often torture, actually. It's really, really difficult. - Oh yeah. The agitation. But I've sat across the table\nfrom you a couple years ago when I was out here in\nAustin doing some work and I was working on stuff you were... And I noticed you'll just stare\nat your notebook sometimes, just like pen at the same position and then you'll get back into it. There are those building\nthat hydraulic pressure and then go. Yeah, I try and get\nsomething done of value, then the communications start. And talking to my podcast producer. My team is everything. I mean, the magic potion in\nthe podcast is Rob Moore, who's has been in the room with me, every single solo. Costello used to be in there with us because that's it. People have asked, journalists have asked, can they sit in? Friends have asked. Nope, just Rob. And for guest interviews, he's there as well. And I talk to Rob all the time. All the time, we talk multiple times per day. In life, I've made some errors in\ncertain relationship domains in my life in terms of partner choice and things like that. And certainly don't\nblame all of it on them, but I've played my role. But in terms of picking business partners and friends to work with him, I mean, Rob's just... It's been bullseye. Rob has been amazing. Mike Blabac, our photographer, and the guys I mentioned earlier, we just communicate as much as we need to and we pour over every\ndecision like near neuroticism before we put anything out there. - Including like even created decisions of like topics to cover all that. - Yeah, like a photo for the\nbook jacket the other day. Mike shoots photos. And then we look at them, we pour over them together. Logo for the Perform\nPodcast with Andy Galpin that we're launching, is that the right contour? Mike's the real... He's got the aesthetic thing 'cause he was at DC so long as a portrait photographer. And he was close friends with Ken Block who did Jim Connor, like all the car jumping\nin the city stuff. He's a true master of that stuff. And we just pour over\nevery little decision. But even which sponsors, there are dozens of ads now. By the way, that whole jazzer sizer thing of me saying, \"Oh, a guy\nwent from a two to a seven,\" I never said that. That's AI. I would never call number off\nsomebody a two to a seven. Are you kidding me? It's crazy. So it's AI. If you bought the thing, I'm sorry. But like our sponsors, we list the sponsors we have and why on our website. And like the decision, do we work with this person or not? Do we still like the product? I mean, we've got ways with sponsors 'cause of changes in the product. Most of the time, it's amicable, all good, but like just every detail and that just takes a\nton of time and energy. But I try and work mostly on content. And my team's constantly trying to keep me out of the other discussions 'cause I obsess. You have to have a team of some sort, someone that you can run things by - For sure. But one of the challenges, the larger the team is, and I'd like to be involved in a lot of different kinds of stuff, including engineering stuff,\nrobotics, work, research, all of those interactions,\nat least for me, take away from the deep work, the deep focus.\n- Right, right. - Unfortunately, I get\ndrained by social interaction even with the people I love and really respect and\nall that kind of stuff. - [Andrew] You're an introvert. - Yeah. Fundamentally an introvert. So to me, it's a trade off getting shit\ndone versus collaborating. And I have to choose wisely because without collaboration,\nwithout a great team, which I'm fortunate\nenough to be a part of, you wouldn't get anything really done. But as an individual contributor, to get stuff done, to do the hard work of\nresearching or programming, all that kind of stuff, you need the hours of deep work. - I used to spend a lot more time alone. That's on my bucket list, spend a bit more time\ndropped into work alone. I think social media causes our brain to go the other direction. I try and answer some comments and then get back to work. - After going to the jungle, I appreciate not using the device. I've played with the\nidea of spending certain, maybe like one week a month\nnot using social media at all. - I used it. So after that morning block, I'll eat some lunch and I'll usually do something while I'm doing lunch or something. And then a bit more work and\nthat real work, deep work. And then round 2:30, I do a non-sleep deep rest, take a short nap, wake up, boom, maybe a little more caffeine, and then lean into it again. I find if you've really\nput in the deep work two or three bouts per day\nby about 5:00 or 6:00 PM, it's over. I was down at Jocko's\nplace not that long ago in the evening, did a sauna session with him and some family members of his and some of their friends. And it's really cool. They all work all day and train all day. And then in the evening, they get together, and they sauna and cold plunge. I'm really into this\nwhole thing of gathering with other people at a\nspecific time of day. I have a gym at my house. Tim will come over and train. We've kind of slowed that\ndown in recent months. But I think gathering\nin groups once a day, being alone for part of the day, and it's very fundamental stuff. We're not saying anything that hasn't been said\nmillions of times before, but how often do actually do that? And call the party. Be the person to bring people together if it's not happening. That's something I've really had to learn even though I'm an introvert. Like, \"Hey!\" I'm like, \"Gather people together.\" You came through town the other day and a lot of people at the house. It was rad. Actually, I was playing 'cause I was getting a\nmassage when you walked in. I don't sit around getting\nmassages very often, but I was getting one that day. And then everyone came\nin, and the dog came in, and everyone was piled in. It was very sweet. - Again, no devices, but choose wisely the\npeople you gather with. - Right, right. And I was clothed. - Thank you for clarifying, which is very weird. Yeah, yeah. The friends you surround yourself with, that's another thing. I understood that from my ayahuasca and from just the experience\nin the jungle is, like, just select the people. Just be careful how\nyou allocate your time. I just saw somewhere. Conor McGregor has this good line, I wrote it down, about loyalty. He said, \"Don't eat with people\nyou wouldn't starve with.\" - Ooh. - I mean, he's big on loyalty. All the shit talk, all of that, set that aside. To me, loyalty is really big because then if you invest in\ncertain people in your life and they stick by you\nand you stick by them, what else is life about? - Yeah. Well, hardship will show you\nwho your real friends are. That's for sure. And we're fortunate to have a lot of them. It'll also show you who really has put in the time to try and understand you\nand understand people. People are complicated. I love that. So you read the quote once more. - Don't eat with people\nyou wouldn't starve with. Yeah. So in that way, a hardship is a gift. It shows you. - Definitely. And it makes you stronger. It definitely makes you stronger. - Let's go get some food. Yeah, you are one meal a day guy. - Yeah. I actually ate something earlier, but it was like a protein shake and a couple pieces of biltong. I hope we're eating a steak. - I hope so too. I'm full of nicotine and caffeine. - Yeah. What do you think? How you feel?\n- I feel good. - Yeah. I was thinking you'd probably... I only did a half a piece and I won't have more for\na little while, but... - [Lex] Little too good. - [Andrew] Yeah. - Thank you for talking\nonce again, brother. - Yeah, thanks so much, Lex. It's been a great ride,\nthis podcast thing. And you're the reason\nI started the podcast. You inspired me to do it. You told me to do it. I did it. And you've also been an amazing friend. You showed up in some\nvery challenging times and you've shown up for me publicly. You've shown up for me\nin my home, in my life. It's an honor to have you as a friend. Thank you. - I love you, brother. - Love you too. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Andrew Huberman. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with\nsome words from Carl Jung, \"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you'll call it fate.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time."
