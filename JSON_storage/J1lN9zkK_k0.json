      "text": "- If Scientology was just\ngetting auditing when you wanted about the subjects you wanted and you could take it or\nleave it, that would be fine. It's the fact that it's part and parcel to this entire organization\nand this entire experience that has, as a part of that experience, taking everything from you, demanding everything from you, controlling who you can speak with, controlling who you can\nhave relationships with, who you have to erase from your life. This is where, and it's hard to, it's hard to place one pinpoint on \"This is where Scientology goes wrong.\" It's really hard to do that, because the good parts of Scientology and the bad parts of Scientology are all just Scientology. - The following is a conversation\nwith Aaron Smith-Levin, a former Scientologist\nraised in Scientology, and have worked in the\norganization full-time for many years as a staff\nmember and a Sea Org member, including the job of training\nScientology auditors. Today, he educates the\npublic about Scientology on his YouTube channel called\n\"Growing Up in Scientology.\" This is The Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Aaron Smith-Levin."

      "text": "Well, let's do a full\noverview of Scientology, it's ideas, how it operates, how it wields its power and influence, and let's start at the very basics. What is Scientology? - Scientology is a belief\nsystem created by L. Ron Hubbard that does fundamentally\nbelieve that we are all immortal spiritual beings, called thetans, that we have native, God-like potential, that there is nothing more\npowerful in the universe than a thetan, like, so God-like is, you know, quite literal here, and that, through various\ndecisions thetans have made, they have fallen away from\ntheir native God-like power to, fallen down to a state where most thetans aren't even aware that they are thetans, aren't even aware that\nthey ever have lived before or have these powers, and that\nthetans are now in a state where they're trapped in\nbodies, trapped here on earth, trapped in this prison\nof a physical universe, trapped on this prison of a planet, and that only Scientology\ncan restore a thetan to its native state. - Are these multiple beings,\nlike is there one thetan inside of me that's\ntrapped in this prison? - Well, the thetan would be you. - The thing would be me. - The thetan is you. - But I'm presumably limited\nin some fundamental way. So this thetan that is me is limited. So there's like 8 billion\nthetans on the planet? - There's one primary\nthetan animating each body. Later in Scientology, you\nlearn there's actually like tens of thousands\nor hundreds of thousands of like sick, unconscious,\nhalf-dead thetans stuck to you that are now an additional\ncause of problems for you. - [Lex] Sure. - But fundamentally, at the lower levels, the non-confidential levels, there's just one thetan per body. - Well, I mean, it's an interesting idea. I just would like to kind of\nexplore the philosophy of that. So there's a being that's all\npowerful, that's immortal, and its projection, its\nmanifestation on this earth is fundamentally limited,\nand you're trying to, the process of Scientology is the process of letting go of those limitations. You know, that's an interesting idea. I mean, a lot of religions\nhave this kind of idea that there's, not just religions, but like we have the capacity\nas human beings to do, to achieve greatness in all kinds of ways. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And that's the question we have with our cognitive abilities. We start with a embryo and\nbuild up and into this organism and like this world of\nopportunities before us, what are we capable of? And the idea that we're\ncapable of almost anything is a really powerful one, and there's a lot of religions, there's a lot of philosophies,\nthere's a lot of advice, self-help that kind of\nexplore those ideas, and so it seems like with Scientology, this, the application of\nthis religious philosophy means that we're limited, and we'll have to break the\nthrough those limitations, and there's a process to break\nthrough those limitations. - That would be correct. So what can make it\nchallenging to adequately and completely describe\nScientology in the beginning is what Scientologists\nbelieve actually changes as they progress further into\nor further up in Scientology. So the explanation as I've given it, is pretty consistent\nwith what you would get at the lowest levels. - Got it.\n- Right. You're a thetan, I'm a thetan, everyone's a thetan, and we have a reactive mind. L. Ron Hubbard would say the reactive mind is a collection of these recordings, mental recordings of any moments\nof pain and unconsciousness you've ever had in your life. It's like the subconscious mind. It is always recording in moments of pain and unconsciousness and\nthat these are called, these recordings are called, L. Ron Hubbard called them \"engrams.\""

      "section": "Dianetics",
      "text": "Now, when L. Ron Hubbard first\nwrote \"Dianetics\" in 1950, this was before Scientology came along a couple years later, right? So in 1950, when he wrote \"Dianetics,\" it wasn't a spiritual endeavor. It was supposed to be a mental health, a science of mental health. So, as of that time, the\nearliest engram you could have was the incident of birth. Being born was an engram, and technically, in \"Dianetics\", he said you could have prenatal engrams, like when you're still in the womb, but there was no concept of past lives as of 1950 version of \"Dianetics,\" right? And so, the idea there was\nthat the reactive mind is essentially a stimulus response mechanism created through evolution\nmillions of years ago to protect the individual from\nthings that would harm them. In other words, things that would bring about\npain and unconsciousness. So you have these recordings\nof things that hurt you, created pain and unconsciousness, and in present time, these\nthings will react upon you in a way to cause you\nto avoid similar things reacting upon you in a\nsubconscious, unconscious way. - So the reactive mind\nprotects you from the trauma that is inside your subconscious mind? - Yes, and the idea is\nwe've now, as human beings, evolved to a state where it no longer serves us beneficially, it\nonly serves us negatively. This was Hubbard's theory, and he said, so you can get rid of\nthese engrams by, you know, basically recalling\nthem and going over them again and again using\nDianetics auditing therapy, and if you get back to the moment of birth and erase the earliest engram, all the other subsequent engrams\non the chain would vanish. - Oh, nice. So there's a chain? - Earlier, similar, earlier, similar, earlier, similar, earlier similar. Okay. So that gives you a\npretty good understanding of how L. Ron Hubbard thought of the mind, because that carries on, has applicability later on in Scientology. - I mean, that's a pretty\npowerful model of the mind. I mean, Freud had similar conceptions that a lot of our traumas are grounded in, sort of poor formulation of sexuality or imperfect formulation of sexuality in early childhood or something like this, and then we're trying\nto figure out the puzzle of whatever we formed in early childhood. - [Aaron] Right. - I mean it's similar, similar kind of. - It is similar. That's probably what Hubbard took it from. In the early days of Dianetics, before he decided psychiatry was evil. - [Lex] Yeah. - He actually credited Sigmund Freud with some of the shoulders\nhe was standing on. - Sure. - [Aaron] In writing \"Dianetics.\" - So he still admired\npsychiatry at that time? So that's an interesting\nmoment of Dianetics. So what else? You mentioned Dianetics,\nauditing was there, too. So if we just, before Scientology, what are the ideas that formed\nwhat we know as Dianetics? - As I've just described\n'em, that is the fundamental. - [Lex] That is. - That is pretty much the\nnuts and bolts of Dianetics. - Was it applied? Was it applied often? - Oh, yeah, no, it's what\nDianetics in the early days was all about was just auditing. Auditing is the process of\nthe one-on-one counseling. Recall a moment of pain\nand unconsciousness, run through the engram over\nand over and over again, find something earlier, similar. That is Dianetics auditing. One of the main things that\nchanged with Scientology is that birth or prenatal engrams were no longer the earliest\nengrams on the chain. - [Lex] Yeah. - The idea is you have to\nget the earliest engram on the chain for the later\nones to blow, which is a race. And so, but all of a sudden,\nnow, with the addition of an immortal spiritual\nbeing into the equation, well now, the earliest incident could be trillions of years ago in\nother galaxies and universes. - Other universes, so before the appointment of this universe? - Oh yeah, yes. - Is there a model of physics\nintegrated in any of this? - [Aaron] No.\n- Okay. - The model is you have\nthe physical universe, and then above that you\nhave the theta universe. So we used the word thetan earlier. So in Scientology, I'll\nuse the word theta. I dunno, theta's just\nbasically thetan power, thetans collectively. So, Hubbard would say you\nhave the theta universe, which is senior to the physical universe and creates the physical universe. And remember, I said, I said\nnative, God-like potentials, so we're not talking about\nthe God who created the earth. We're just, like Scientologists\ndon't believe in a God, but we'll get into that later. We're talking about\njust creating universes, like just think like matrix, like just. - [Lex] Yeah. - When I say creating a universe, essentially just creating\ndifferent thetan simulations. - But it sounds like a little bit more like the ideas of Plato, which is there's these platonic forms, there's abstract forms that are bigger, more general than our\nparticular reality here, and those forms are used\nto construct the reality. - [Aaron] Well, I grew up in a cult, so I'm not familiar\nwith the works of Plato. (Aaron laughing) - [Lex] You can't use that\nas an excuse for everything. (Aaron continues laughing) - I would like to, you know, non-jokingly - [Aaron] Yeah. - Steelman the case, because\na lot of philosophies, a lot of religions, a lot of\neven scientific endeavors, are a little bit full of uncertainty. You can call it bullshit,\nbut you're on unsturdy ground because we're surrounded by mystery, and you have to take these\nideas somewhat seriously and see where those ideas go wrong. This happens with communism, this happens with capitalism, these ideas sound beautiful\nin their ideal forms, and then they somehow go wrong, and some go more wrong than others. And so I don't think sort of, it's easy to sort of caricature\nand make fun of the ideas. I think if you take them seriously, you'll start to understand like, when you're in it, it was serious. It can be very convincing. It's, you know, the devil is going to\nbe a charismatic person, he's not going to be a caricature\nof a ridiculous person, so that helps us understand which ideas will sound appealing, but\nwill become dangerous. - I totally agree. In fact, it's one of the\nthrusts I have on my channel is wanting to talk about\nScientology in a way that would actually resonate\nwith current Scientologists. - [Lex] Yeah. - Not just resonate with\nformer Scientologists. I want people who are\nstill in to be able to hear how I talk about it and go,\n\"Wow, he's being really fair.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - \"And really accurate. He's not just a hater,\"\nyou know what I mean? - If you look at the, you know, let's take, one of the worst\nplaces on Earth is North Korea. You have Kim Jong-un, and the reality is there's a\nlot of citizens of that nation that deeply love the leader, because they've grew up in that way, and you, I mean, through fear, through all kinds of manipulation, through propaganda and so on, they're not allowed to love\nmembers of their own family. They're not allowed to have romantic love. They're only allowed to\nhave love for the leader. And to reach those people, you have to empathize with the fact that, in their eyes, in some\nsense, this is a great man. This is a God, a Messianic figure. You can't just make fun\nof the ridiculousness of the situation that this\npudgy person waltzing around creating propaganda, like how's this the? (Aaron laughing) - [Aaron] With a funny haircut. - With a funny haircut. Like, it's so easy, Hitler too, to make fun of, to make a caricature of the person, but this is a real person, a real person that influenced the minds of millions of people, in the case of Hitler, you know, tens of millions of people, and created a huge amount of suffering, not because of the caricature version, but because he was a charismatic leader. He was somebody that people\ndeeply, deeply loved, and that just, over time, I mean, with the abuse of any kind of ideology, this happens over and over. And so, yeah, it's interesting\nbecause Scientology is so close to the core\nof what is America, because so many Americans\nare involved with it, so it's interesting to study\nthe beauty and the power of the ideas that underlie\nit and where things go wrong. - Yeah. And I'll just say it's\ninteresting to note, you would never get a representative of the Church of Scientology to sit down and have a conversation with you and even be as fair and\naccurate about Scientology as I'm going to be, which is noteworthy. - Do you honestly deeply\nbelieve that's the case? There's not going to be\na high-level official that would sit down for a conversation? - No. - I disagree with you. - [Aaron] I hope you're right. - Because I think that, given the current dynamics\nof what's happening, I think in order to save, from their perspective, in order to save the the\nChurch of Scientology, they have to be transparent and authentic. Basically steelman their case, but better. - You would think so. - Well, we'll talk about the other ways you could do that, which\nis through manipulation, through propaganda,\nthrough controlled media, and all that kind of stuff. - They paint themselves into\na corner of not being able to send a representative\nout into the world to speak honestly about it, because you're literally not allowed to. So when faced, you know, if you're just sitting down with an entertainment journalist, a representative might be able to fudge their way through an interview, but sitting down for a\nlong-form format interview with someone who is gonna ask them about Xenu and the body thetans and Leah Remini and Lisa McPherson, that's a no-go zone. So I'm representing why\nit will never happen, but shit, I would tune\nin for that interview. I mean, I hope you do get someone. - You don't think David Miscavige will sit down for an interview? - I would love to be wrong. - You know, in general, journalists, in these\nkinds of situations can be, can attack in a way that doesn't empathize and doesn't come from a\nplace of deep knowledge and understanding, and\nI think it's possible to have serious conversations\nwith people like that in an empathetic way, but it's\nalso in a challenging way. I think there's a huge\namount of trust required, and obviously, for a very\nsecretive organization, the amount of trust, yes,\nmight be too much required. - Yes. Anyone over there, if\nthey've done their homework, knows you're gonna be as fair as anyone in the world's going to be, and yet, there's simply things they're not allowed to talk about, and they're not even allowed to say, \"I'm not allowed to talk about it.\" - So that's a fundamental part\nof the Church of Scientology is the secrecy? - [Aaron] Yeah. - So that's where you're\ntrained as you go up through the ranks, is \"Secrecy, secrecy.\" - It's not even a matter of training, it's that there's an entire,\nthe entire upper half of Scientology's Bridge\nis simply confidential. I mean, and I never even did those levels when I was in Scientology. I didn't learn what\nScientologists actually believe on those upper levels until\nafter I got outta Scientology, and I was freaking born and raised in it. - Let's go there, let's\ngo to your personal story. So you spent 30 years in Scientology? - Yeah, I was four years\nold when my mom got in. - And then about seven years ago got out. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And you're on what YouTube channel now, and you're an educator? - So I was four years old when my mom got introduced to Scientology. - [Lex] Yeah. - And she got in really\nfast, really quick. So, but I was 12 years old\nwhen I was taken out of school and started officially full-time\nworking for Scientology. Okay, so, in various\ncapacities I worked for them from the ages of 12 to the age of 26. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Okay. So, and then I was 34 when I officially parted\nways with Scientology, which was really more them\nofficially parting ways with me, but we can get into all that later. That's just kinda how Scientology does it. - And what do you do now\nin terms of Scientology? So now I run \"Growing Up in Scientology,\" the YouTube channel, but\nwhat I primarily do is I help run an organization\nthat helps people who are escaping from Scientology. I'm the Vice President of\n\"The Aftermath Foundation\" and we created the foundation\nafter the television show, \"Leah Remini\" Scientology\nand the Aftermath,\" and there was such an\noutpouring of support from non-Scientologists\nall over the world, \"What can we do to help\npeople leave Scientology?\" that we decided to create a foundation, and it's been incredibly successful. We've helped people\nescape from all regions and echelons of Scientology. We've accomplished, what we've\naccomplished is far beyond what we actually envisioned\nwould be possible. It's been a huge success. - So we'll talk about the negative aspect, the abuses of power, but let's just explore the\nideas a little bit more."

      "text": "So the public facing\nthree fundamental truths of Scientology, maybe\ncorrect me if I'm wrong, man is an immortal spiritual being, like we said with thetans, his experience extends well\nbeyond a single lifetime, so infinite memory backwards. His capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized. The capabilities are unlimited, are? - Yeah, God, So that when I say God-like, I really just mean, you\nknow, Thanos, like unlimited. Scientologists don't believe in a God, so when I say God-like, I just mean the most powerful entity, the creator, the prime mover unmoved, except we are all that. You know, a thetan in definition, in Scientology, a thetan has\nno position in space or time. A thetan does not actually\nexist in the physical universe. It might choose to locate\nitself in the physical universe, right, and then forget\nthat it made that decision and then sort of get caught and trapped in the physical universe, but that, once the thetan is\nrestored to its native powers, everything you see here\nin the physical universe is just a thetan playing a game. Like literally, we are in a simulation right now of some thetan. So like physics doesn't have to make sense when we're talking about it this way. Like technically you're\na thetan, I'm a thetan, we're here, but it could, this could also all just\nbe another thetan's game. - So thetans all the way down. - Yeah. It's just thetans everywhere. Thetans, it all comes down to the thetan. - Is there an idea of a God? 'Cause I read there's a kind of, there is a sense of a supreme being. Is that basically the\nthetan that's at the core, at the bottom of it all? - [Aaron] Yes. - Not per, not defined, undefined. - Correct. Scientology has this\nconcept of the dynamics. L. Ron Hubbard breaks life\ninto a different dynamics and the, a dynamic meaning\na thrust towards survival. So he would say, you know, the first dynamic is you yourself. Second dynamic is your family. Third dynamic is any other\ngroup that you're a part of other than your family. Fourth dynamic is all humankind. The fifth dynamic is\nplant and animal life, all non-human life. Sixth dynamic is the physical world. Seventh dynamic is sort of like\nspirituality, collectively, thetans, us as thetans. And the eighth dynamic,\nL. Ron Hubbard says Scientology doesn't deal\nwith the eighth dynamic, but we recognize that\npeople have this idea of a supreme being, and so, Scientology says you\ncan call the eighth dynamic, \"The Supreme Being dynamic,\"\nbut we call it \"infinity,\" just the allness of everything\nwithout having to define it. And then they sort of do a little dance and they're like, \"Scientology, the purpose of Scientology\nis to get you to the point where you have your own\nunderstandings or realizations about the nature of the eighth dynamic. We don't tell you what you\nhave to believe about that\". And technically speaking, that is true. Technically speaking, that is true. There's no point in Scientology\nwhere they sit you down and say \"You're now required to revoke your belief in a supreme being,\" It's just that everything in Scientology is inconsistent with a\nbelief in a supreme being. You can still find Scientologists who, through cognitive dissonance, will tell you they believe\nin a supreme being. Mostly, they're lying to you. - How is this inconsistent\nwith a supreme being, because like thetans? - [Aaron] Because thetans have\ncreated everything, not God. - Okay, so thetans created everything. Did they, they're also a creative force, they're not just the force\nthat runs everything. - [Aaron] Right. - But can't those be just\nthe fingertips of a God? - Sure. The only way you could\nreconcile a supreme being is if you say a single supreme\nbeing created all theta. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like the spiritual big bang. - [Lex] Yep. - But that's not what most\npeople think when they say, when they talk about God. They're talking about a creator of. - The physical universe. - [Aaron] Yes.\n- But there's no theta. - Right. I mean, even as I've\ndescribed Scientology so far, none of what I've said is something I even subject to ridicule. This is pretty common\nsense stuff actually. I mean, if you believe in\nspirituality or spirits at all, there's nothing I've\ndescribed so far that's crazy. - [Lex] Yeah. - You know, believing in past lives isn't particularly unique or special. - [Lex] Right. - The fact that Scientology\ndoes this little dance of pretending to believe in a God. I mean, it's even like a PR line. Scientology representatives will tell you, \"You can be a Christian\nand be a Scientologist.\" Well, lemme tell you what, Christians don't believe in past lives and lives on other galaxies\nand planets and universes. They, but, and Scientology knows that. Scientology knows you can't be a Christian and be a Scientologist,\nbut they will say that. It's just an example of sort of the fundamental baked-in dishonesty. - Because it's so\nimportant to Scientology, on the organization level,\nto have tax exempt status, I wonder, how do you,\ndo you know the process of what it takes to prove that an organization is a religion? - While going through\nthat process with the IRS, for the second time, by the way, Scientology actually had tax\nexemption in the early days and the IRS pulled it and\nthen they got it back in 1993. While going through that process again, the IRS actually took issue with the fact that Scientology was claiming you could be a Scientologist and a member of another religion. The IRS actually said,\n\"Pump the brakes there.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - \"If you're gonna say that, we're gonna say you're not a religion.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And they actually put\nin writing to the IRS, \"No, no, no, no, no. That's not what we meant! That's not what we meant! We meant in the beginning you can be both, but eventually, you just\nhave to be a Scientologist.\" - So you mentioned the eight dynamics, but you also mentioned survival, so that seems to be a core principle, that human existence is about survival. Can you elaborate what\nis meant by survival? Are we talking about the\nsurvival of the human species? Survival of the individual humans? Survival of the manifestation\nof thetans in human form? What do we, what's survival? - So it would be all of that, because survival is the dominant force across all the dynamics that, I mean, L. Ron Hubbard, it was either Dianetics\nor science of survival. He says he \"Discovered the principle upon which all life exists,\" and that is all life, no\nmatter what it is trying to do, are you ready, Lex?\n- [Lex] Mm-hmm. - It's trying to survive. - That's pretty powerful. That's pretty powerful. (Aaron laughing) - See, here's the thing.\n- Is it? - Here's no, I gotta tell you, I gotta. - You might get me back in, Lex. - No, I'm not, I'm not\ntrying to get you back in. I'm trying to take you,\nget you to take seriously, the power of the ideas behind Scientology, because I think those\nideas are not bad ideas. They resonate with a lot of\nideas throughout philosophy, throughout religions, throughout the history\nof human civilization. The interesting aspect\nis how it goes wrong. - But here's the thing,\nLex, here's the thing. It is consistent with\nprior efforts or studies. It's just that L. Ron Hubbard said this was a watershed breakthrough that it was being discovered\nfor the first time. That's kind of what I'm mocking really - Yeah, but you can mock\nNietzsche for saying \"Man is will to power.\" You can mock Freud. - [Aaron] But did he claim to be the first person to ever say it? - Well, Nietzsche had a bit of an ego, so. (Aaron laughing) - Like, and he's full of contradictions, but I'm pretty sure, the implied thing is that\nhe was the first to say it. - [Aaron] Yeah. - There's a lot of scientists, there's a, one of the people I really\nadmire is Stephen Wolfram, who wrote a book called\n\"A New Kind of Science\" that explores complex\nsystems and cellular automata and these mathematical systems that have been explored before, but he boldly kind of defined, \"I am presenting to you a whole new way to look at the world\" and if you just set a little bit of the ego behind that aside, there's actually beautiful ideas in there. They have, of course, been done\nbefore and explored before, but sometimes, people declare\n- Sure. - [Lex] \"This is the coolest.\" - That's the only thing\nI'm really mocking is - [Lex] Yes. - He said this discovery that\nlife is trying to survive is greater than the discovery of fire. Okay, I mean, it gets a\nlittle silly, but that's fine. We can agree that the fact\nthat life is trying to survive has meaning and is meaningful\nand can be, is valuable, and it's true, I mean,\nlife is trying to survive. - Also, there's a non-trivial definition of \"What is life?\" here,\nso this idea of a thetan, the thing that permeates through lifetimes - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- Through people, there's some fabric that is bigger than individual biological bags of meat. That's a, philosophically,\nan interesting idea. Of course, if it's not grounded in a little bit more physical reality, then it becomes a little too woo-woo. And the way L. Ron Hubbard and\nScientology define survival is very much intertwined\nwith how they define ethics. Ethics, anything, you know,\nto be ethical is pro-survival, to be unethical is counter-survival, but we were talking about just\nthe concept of the dynamics, like what does survival refer to? And it actually does refer to all of them, but just keep in mind, when it\ncomes to the seventh dynamic, thetans collectively,\ninvolved in here is the idea that a thetan cannot die. There's no such thing as killing a thetan. A thetan can only, can only survive. And so, anyway, this\nconcept of the dynamics is one of the most fundamental\nand important concepts in Scientology, but,\nbecause I mentioned that, it also gets tied up with\nethics, and this probably speaks to what you were just talking about, is you can have the ideas and the concepts and you can have \"How do they go wrong?\" because they hold that Scientology, applying Scientology, getting\npeople into Scientology, is the key to basically saving every spiritual being in existence. When you're analyzing what is ethical, it becomes whatever's good\nfor Scientology becomes, by definition, ethical, because anything that's\ngood for Scientology, which is a third dynamic, is inherently good for all the dynamics, so that's where you get the\nends justifying the means to do anything possible,\nuse any means necessary, to forward the aims of Scientology. - That's kind of where a\nlot of Soviet implementation of communism went wrong, is\nthe ends justify the means, the equality, the justice for the workers, if we have to kill,\nmurder, imprison, censor - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- In in the name of that, then it's for the greater\ngood in the long term to achieve the ideal of communism. - In some respect, Scientology\ncreated a near-perfect communist experiment in\nits Sea Organization. What is it, \"From everyone\naccording to their ability to each according to their\nneed\" or something like that? Scientology's Sea\nOrganization is a damn near a perfect communist experiment, coming from someone who\ndoesn't necessarily know what the perfect communist\nexperiment really is, 'cause I'm not, I grew up in a cult, Lex. - You can't keep using that as an excuse. - [Aaron] It's a funny\ntagline I use in my videos. - I like it. - But like, it is interesting\nthat an organization that is so hyper-capitalist\nand so money hungry and is known to be very wealthy, at its' core is run by this\ngroup of Sea Org members that live a communist lifestyle."

      "text": "- We're gonna jump around. - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- Let's go. What is Sea Org? What is Sea Organization? What is this organization? - The Sea Organization is\nthe most dedicated version, the most dedicated\nbrand of Scientologists. So there's three like\nechelons of Scientologists. There's public, who just live\nnormal lives in the real world and they pay to do Scientology\ncourses in auditing. Then there's staff members who\nalso live in the real world but work on two and a half year contracts or five-year contracts at their local Scientology organization, and then once they finish their contract, their debt is paid or whatever. And then there's the Sea Org members. These are the guys who signed\nthe billion-year contracts. They don't have lives\nin the outside world. They don't own property. They live in Scientology-provided housing. They eat in Scientology-run cafeterias. - Is there an actual contract\nthat says a billion years? - It's symbolic, but yes. - [Lex] Okay. - Like no, it's not a\nlegally enforceable contract. (Aaron laughing) They haven't succeeded in enforcing it in any subsequent lifetimes yet. - Marriage contracts should\nbe like that, a billion years, 'cause then we, not\n\"'til death do us part,\" but a billion years. It really makes it very concrete of what you're signing up for. - Yeah. Those are the billion-year guys. You hear a lot about \"The\nbillion-year contract, the billion-year contract.\" That's the Sea Org, and all\nof Scientology management, international management,\nmiddle management, continental management,\nand even some lower level service orgs are composed\n100% of Sea Org members. You're not allowed to\nmarry or date someone who's not in the Sea Org. You're also not allowed to have children. - With anybody outside of\nSea Org, or in general, you're not allowed to have children? - Sea Org members are not\nallowed to have children unless they leave the Sea Org. You're expected to have an\nabortion and stay in the Sea Org, 'cause it's the greatest\ngood for Scientology, if you accidentally get pregnant. - Interesting, 'cause it distracts from the focus of the work? - [Aaron] Yeah. - What about sexual relations? - Only once married, but that's why people get\nmarried after like three days. You're like, \"Hey you, you\nlook, you look all right. Let's get married.\" - Are you allowed to have divorce? - Yeah, you get divorced\na lot in the Sea Org. I've known people who\nget married and divorced three times by like, by the age of 25. - [Lex] Oh wow, okay. - Because, in the Sea Org, getting married is\npractically like dating. - [Lex] Right. - Also, unless you're married, you're living in dorms with\na bunch of other people, so in order to get your own room, you also have to get married. So there's many benefits. - Oh wow, okay. So you mentioned communism, in which way, is there a hierarchy inside Sea Org? Is there a redistribution of influence, position, money, power in the Sea Org? - Everyone in the Sea\nOrg makes $50 a week. - [Lex] Everybody? - Except David Miscavige, but, right, and some posts might have a\ncash bonus incentive structure, but fundamentally,\ntheir pay is $50 a week, so even the head of a big\nScientology organization is getting 50 bucks a week. - Are celebrities also part\nof Sea Org or no, not usually? So this is really the management layer. So what's the idea behind $50 a week? Is that basically live a humble life? - They don't have to\ngive you anything at all, It's just cons- oh, you mean like what's\nthe idea behind not paying? - Yeah, basically not paying. - Everything you need is\nalready being provided for you. You're not here for the money. You're working all the time anyway, it's not like, you don't have days off. I mean, you're working all the time. There's not, it's, there's\nno concept of the weekends. There's no, \"Oh, thank God it's Friday.\" Friday's just another day. - And how are the positions,\nthe tasks, the jobs allocated within the Sea Org? - [Aaron] What do you mean? - Like what kind of tasks you're doing, what kind of stuff you're doing? - It's very similar to\njust any other business as far as you're gonna\nhave your human resources, you're gonna have your sales, you're gonna have your accounting, your operations, your quality control, it's just that, in\nScientology, your operations is delivering courses in auditing, so. - [Lex] Got it. - Your operations and your quality control are where most of the activity occurs as far as delivering Scientology, and then you've got your, you'd call it business development, but that's just bringing\nin new members, right? So the function of a\nScientologist organization is very, very comparable\nto a normal business in the normal world. - So let's talk about the\nproducts of this business,"

      "section": "Auditing",
      "text": "auditing and courses. So what's auditing? - So auditing is, so we described earlier, Dianetics auditing. Scientology auditing is\nvery similar to that. - So at first glance, it\nlooks like psychotherapy, a kind of therapy? - All Scientology auditing\nis going to look like that. It's one-on-one talk therapy. You're in a room by yourselves,\nno distraction, no noise. - One-on-one.\n- [Aaron] Yeah. - So like this? - Yeah, but, and in Scientology, they have what's called an E-meter. - [Lex] Right. - Almost all auditing employs\nthe use of an E-meter. - What's an E-meter? - So an E-meter is a\ndevice that just measures the resistance to a small electrical flow, except Scientologists\nbelieve that this E-meter can be used to simply direct the progress of an auditing session, to determine whether\nthe auditing has reached a good satisfactory, conclusion. All auditing sessions have to end on a satisfactory conclusion, like that's the job of the auditor. There's, you don't just, it's not like, \"Sorry the session sucked,\nsee you next week!\" It's not like that. Every auditing session has\nto end on a positive note, and if it doesn't, there's\ncorrections to be made. So the E-meter. - What does it look like visually? Like? - Oh, you can pull it up. Pull up \"Mark VIII. E-meter Mark VIII.\" - So there's a few dials. - [Aaron] Yep. - There's basic information\nabout time and duration, I'm presuming, then a dial that\njust goes zero to something. - Okay, so let's say that\nthe meter's in front of me and you're the one holding the cans. - I'm holding the cans, so you're doing the auditing of me? - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- Okay, okay. I'm holding the cans. - No, literally in the beginning\nof an auditing session, when you're calibrating the\nsensitivity of the E-meter, you do a can squeeze. So I go \"Squeeze the cans please.\" - Okay, so I'm just\nlike squeezing the cans. - Yeah, and I'm just\nchanging the sensitivity, 'cause when you squeeze the cans, I want to get about a\none third of a dial drop on the needle. The idea is you don't want, if the needle's too sensitive, then every time you shift\naround in your chair, the needle's gonna bounce\nall over the place, so you're trying to set the\nsensitivity to this thing and that's all. The knob there on the bottom to the left, that's the sensitivity knob, and that determines just how much, how sensitive the needle's gonna be, and the bigger dial is\ncalled the tone arm, and that is changing, I\nwanna say voltage or current, but I'm not intending, I'm gonna get, one of those\nwords is wrong, right? - But it is a real device.\n- [Aaron] It's a real device - That you can actually\ncalibrate to probably, you know, get an outcome that you want? - Yeah. So here's even how, just how a Scientology\nauditor believes it works. You're holding the cans, there's a tiny little\nbattery in that E-meter that's sending and el-, you're completing the circuit\nwhen you pick up the cans, right, so you got a\nlittle thing going there, and that needle will respond\nto your physical movement, but that's not what we want. We want you to sit the hell still so that we can read this thing when I'm asking you questions. Okay. - So you're sitting\nthere still, very still. - As still as you can.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Comfortable, right? And I'm gonna go, \"Is there something you're\nwithholding from me?\" and what I'm looking for is, right when I say at the end of \"me,\" I'm looking for the needle\nto dip to the right. - Having a needle, even\nif it's kind of random, can really be like a\ncatalyst for a conversation. - That's what it's used for. except it's an enforced conversation, so I'll give you a really\ngood example of this. So you're holding the cans, say, \"Is there anything\nyou're withholding from me?\" and I get an instant read and I go, \"Is there anything you're\nwithholding from me?\" You're gonna go, \"I don't think so.\" - And I don't see the needle. - No, you don't see the needle. Okay. I go, \"Well, what did you think of when I asked you the question?\" Now, if you've already\nhad a lot of auditing, you know how this goes. It means I got an instant read and we're not going to move on until this question gets resolved, okay? So you're gonna go, \"I don't know what I was thinking of\" and then I'm gonna,\nI'll be like, you know, \"Take a look and I'll help you out here.\" I'll try to steer you. Okay. So I'm looking to get\nroughly the same read while you're thinking about whatever. \"I mean, what was that? What was that right there?\" - And you can start digging to what? You can start. - I just want an answer\nto the question, okay? - And I can go to memory. - Yeah, and you can give\nme any answer you want. There's no way for me to\nknow if you're giving me the right answer, but I want\nyou to give me something. - [Lex] Yeah. - If you say you can't give me anything, I'm gonna keep using the E-meter until you give me something. - [Lex] Yeah. - Okay, so let's say\nyou give me something. I'm gonna get all the details about that, and until like time,\nplace, form, and event, I wanna know everything that happened. I want to know all the details. And by the way, I'm writing all this down, so I'm taking notes of\neverything you're telling me that it's a bad thing that you did that you haven't told me about. Okay, so I'm keeping notes. When you represent to\nme that you've told me everything there is to tell, I'm looking for the needle to give like a smooth back and forth motion like this, and Scientology calls\nthat a floating needle. That means, in Scientology\nland, we're done with that. So now, I might go back\nto check the question. \"Okay, good. I'll check\nthe question again. Is there anything you're\nwithholding from me?\" Ooh, if I got another read, we gotta go through the process again. Okay. If you tell me \"I've told you everything\" and I don't get a floating\nneedle, I've gotta go, \"Okay, is there an earlier, similar thing? Have you basically done\nan earlier, similar thing? Is they're an earlier, similar time you haven't told someone something? Or is there an earlier\nsimilar thing that you did to the thing that you just told me?\" We're gonna keep going earlier, similar, earlier, similar, earlier, similar until I get a floating\nneedle, and that's where, I'm explaining it this\nway so you can see how no matter what the\nspecific auditing session happens to be about, there's still the potential\nin any auditing session that you're going into past lives. - [Lex] Yeah. - Just because you have\nto go earlier, similar until you get a floating needle. Okay, now here's how Scientologists think the E-meter actually works, meaning why does the E-meter work? So we talked before about\nthese mental pictures, right, these recordings? - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - Okay, well we spoke about engrams, just recordings of pain\nand unconsciousness. Well, Scientology would hold the bad recordings aren't the\nonly recordings that you have, those are just the recordings\nin your reactive mind. You also have an analytical mind, which is just your conscious memory, conscious recording of\neverything from present time to the last 76 trillion years. - [Lex] Yep. - And Hubbard would\nsay that these memories are actually a perfectly\ndetailed recording, I think he says like 56\nperceptions or something, and that it's perfect and you\ncan access that information, you just have trouble doing so. Okay, so he says that these recordings, these mental pictures, have actual electrical charge in mass. Now you asked before, is there\nany actual physics in this? I don't know. Where are you supposed\nto store the pictures of your last 76 trillion years\nthat have charge in mass? I don't see it, but\nHubbard says it's there. Okay. So he says that these things have mass and when you recall them\nor put attention on them, you create an electrical flow, which maybe through\nmagnetic fields or whatever impinges upon the electrical\nflow of the E-meter and it shows up as a read on the needle. That's how Scientologists believe that's why the needle reads. Now cynics would say the needle only reads on palm sweat and movement. Well, I know that's not true. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - Right, I can't tell you everything the needle does read on, but\nI can tell you it's not just moving your hands and sweaty hands. - It does correlate to thoughts probably. - Some way, some how. - 'Cause if it didn't\ncorrelate to thoughts, this process would be way too inefficient, because you, it would be too, there's going to be a bunch\nof people who are just not - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- You're not gonna get the, what is it called? The floating needle. Like no matter what. - I can't explain to you how\nyou get a floating needle, but it sure as hell isn't hand sweat and it sure as hell\nisn't squeezing the cans. - Right, so you, eventually most people will get to the floating\nneedle and somehow. - [Aaron] You get floating needles. - There's like a feed, there probably is a feedback mechanism that each person realizes how their mind and body\n- [Aaron] Yeah. - Because you want a resolution, right? - It's probably - [Lex] You want your needle\nto float, for both people. - Yes. - And it's probably a great\nexperience when you're like, \"Yes!\" it's a gamified feeling, right? - Well when you're training\non how to use the E-meter, there are drills where you practice, generating with your mind,\nvarious needle reactions. So, you know, there is a\ndrill where you sit there and you consciously try to\ncreate a floating needle by recalling happy thoughts. - [Lex] Yeah. - \"Go to your happy place.\" And at the end of every auditing session, you actually have to go to a third party, sit down in front of an E- meter, and verify that your needle's floating. - [Lex] Nice. - Every single auditing\nsession not only has to end on a floating needle, but then you have to go to someone else and have the floating needle verified. Any Scientologist who's a\nseasoned recipient of auditing knows how to make their\nneedle float at the examiner. (Aaron laughing) - Well I gotta be honest though, this process, again, sorry\nto be sort of going there, but it feels like this is a very rigorous talk therapy session. Is there good aspects to this? - Sure. A lot of people find\nauditing very helpful. I mean, I've heard some describe it as quite thoroughly addictive. Me personally, I never\nenjoyed getting auditing. That's probably more a function\nof having been raised in it and it was never something I wanted to do, it was something that was forced\non me as a child, you know? And also I was never, I don't like talking about\nprivate secret stuff. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like you kind of have to\nwant to be an open book. - [Lex] Sure. - To honestly and thoroughly participate in an auditing session. - 'Cause there's not necessarily a belief that this is gonna be private. - There's no expectation of privacy, but there's no expectation\nthat your stuff's gonna be leaked for\nblackmail either, I mean. - [Lex] You kind of. - You trust the people\nin the organization. - Even despite rumors and stuff like that? But the rumors are coming from people that are lying to you, essentially. - If you're a Scientologist\nand you're participating in an auditing session, you know that anyone\nin the organization is, has the ability to know\nthe stuff that you talk. It's not like, \"Oh my God,\nI'm only telling my auditor 'cause I think no one's ever gonna know.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - You know that people know.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But you also trust the organization. - How quickly does it go to past memories? - For people who are seasoned, like they actually like going past-life. - [Lex] Yeah. - I hated it. I would make sure, I was really good at\nmaking my needle float. I didn't want to have some auditor, 'cause I never believed\nin the past-life memories. - [Lex] Yeah. - So I didn't wanna be in that impassable, you know, reach an impasse\nin an auditing session where I was being asked for\nsomething I couldn't provide, 'cause I knew this auditing session has to end on a good point. - [Lex] Yeah. - But Scientologists enjoy,\nfor the most part going, they call it whole track, whole track is past-life, going whole track. Your time track, they\ncall it the time track, is your whole memory, but whole track refers\nto anything past-life. - [Lex] Okay. - So going whole track or deep whole track with high reality. Meaning it's not like, \"Oh, I have a fuzzy memory and\nI'm not sure if it's real.\" Like your real seasoned\nScientologists are like, \"Oh yeah, I was on this planet\" - [Lex] Oh\n- \"at this time circling, and this is what I was\neating for breakfast.\" - Fascinating. Before the origin of\nlife on earth or before? So billions of years\nago, on a distant planet, what you were eating for breakfast. - [Aaron] Or other universes. - I wonder if there's a\nnice shortcut to sneak up to actual trauma that happened\nto you as a therapy device. I just, so putting Scientology aside, I just, I'm thinking about,\nas a technique for therapy, discussing, basically, you\nknow, some people have trauma, and one of the things you do with therapy is like bring the trauma to the surface, that's the stuff that\nhappened to your childhood. Maybe it's a more convenient thing to do to kind of map that\nindirectly onto a fictitious telling of what happened to you, something like that trauma,\non a distant planet elsewhere. It could be a nice way to sneak up to it. - Yeah. And it goes both flows there, not just things that have happened to you, but things that you've done. - [Lex] Yeah. - So, you know, you\ncould be being asked for, you know, you'd be going back to, \"I wiped out a civilization.\" - [Lex] Oh wow.\n- \"I committed genocide on, this race on this planet.\" - [Lex] Oh wow. - Oh, yeah. - So you can actually\ntake on a whole new guilt? - [Aaron] Oh, yeah. - So I, okay, all right, you might actually take on a\nlot more guilt than let go of, because if you feel like\nself-critical aspect of the brain, boy, 'cause I'm, my brain\nis really self-critical, so I could see myself manufacturing, if I was forced over time, some kind of story where I did genocide a whole population of\nlike Pluto or something at a distant, somewhere in Alpha Centauri. - [Aaron] Yeah, so I mean. - And now I walk around with that guilt. \"Wait, I'm actually a horrible person.\" - So imagine though, if you had, not only are you looking at, you know, if someone's being self-critical, trying to identify destructive\npatterns of behavior in your present life, but\nwhat if you really internalize the fact that \"I haven't only\nbeen this way for 40 years.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - \"I've been this way\nfor 40 trillion years.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - But Scientology would\nargue that, as a thetan, you're inherently good. All thetans are basically good, so the goal of the\nauditing procedure there would be essentially to figure out, find the moment, find what\nit was that caused you to make that shift as a being, to dramatize, you know, evil\nintentions and stuff like that. So even if you're going whole track looking at all the\nhorrible things you'd done, the goal is to find like, \"Well, what happened just prior to that? What was like the prior confusion and what did you misunderstand\njust before that?\" and whatnot. So the goal is basically,\nso Scientologists, after a lot of auditing, are also convinced that\nthey have fixed the reason for any non-optimum conduct. - And underlying this is a belief that, at the core, we're all good? - [Aaron] Yes. - There's a lot of really\npowerful ideas in Scientology. - [Aaron] That's true.\n- Which is so interesting that it goes wrong. - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- Okay. What about the training? You mentioned the training of the auditor. That's really interesting.\n- [Aaron] Yeah. So what's, how lengthy is that process? - It can take years. - I mean, one of that\nquestions I wanna ask is, are people in Sea Org, like as an auditor, do you believe everything? How much, is there a crisis\nof faith that creeps in? In religion, you have a crisis of faith when you start to wonder\nlike, \"Does God even exist?\" So in this case, how often\ndo you start to doubt that some of the core beliefs\nof Scientology are false? - Scientology would say that Scientology is not about beliefs,\nit's about application of the techniques of Scientology auditing to improve someone's spiritual\nawareness and ability. So the belief level of Scientology is pretty much the stuff\nwe've already discussed. - The effectiveness of\nthe auditing process? - So the effectiveness\nof the auditing process, this is one of the things Hubbard says, is that standard tech, standard, Scientology, they call it the tech, the technology of how to deliver auditing, standard tech, works 100% of the time when applied 100% correctly. Well that's kind of unfalsifiable, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - Because anytime it doesn't work. - It wasn't applied correctly. - Exactly. That's a nice little escape hatch to pull on having a crisis of faith. \"Well, it didn't work!\" \"Well, then obviously, it\nwasn't applied correctly.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - That's where quality control comes in. Their job is to nitpick, and you can always find one thing that wasn't done correctly. - Communism didn't work because it wasn't implemented correctly. It's the, it's always, it's always, it's always an escape\nhatch with ideologies. - [Aaron] That's right.\n- For sure. - That's right. I would probably argue that auditors are not in a position of\nhaving many crises of faith, 'cause actually, they're\nusually seeing people, for the most part, improve in some ways through the process of auditing. Now, auditing can create like a state, somewhat of a euphoric state. You feel great, you're\njust blown outta your head, you know, you feel, you're\non top of the world. I've had that in some of my auditing. - As an auditor, sorry? - [Aaron] No, as the\nperson receiving auditing. - Okay. - And so, my point is, as an auditor doing a lot of auditing, you know, you're gonna have\nsomeone in front of called, the pre-clear is the\nperson in front of you who's getting the auditing,\ncalled the PC or the pre-clear. They see, over and over and over again, these PCs having these\nsort of euphoric states and floating needles, and \"I\nfeel great and fantastic.\" \"Oh thanks, you saved my\nlife\" and da da da da da. Like, I've always said, if people didn't find Scientology helpful, nobody would ever stay in Scientology. - Right. - Right. And so, auditors are pretty much the ones doing the heavy lifting\nof what it even means to be a Scientologist. Those guys aren't the ones that you end up having crises of faith. I mean, doing Scientology auditing, it doesn't require that you believe, just have faith that\nyou believe something, you just have to go through these motions, and Scientologists, one of\nthe reasons Scientologists think this is all scientific\nis 'cause it's like, \"I don't care if you\nbelieve why this works, I care how you feel at the\nend of an auditing session.\" - And empirically speaking,\nlike anecdotal data is, it actually seems to\nimprove people's lives within the context, so taking the outside world out of it, within this particular organization, you're actually measurably\nseeing improvement? - [Aaron] Yes. - Is that, to some degree, real, because like if you look at\na book like \"Animal Farm\" where the pigs start to\nrule the other animals, and over time, the life of the animals gets worse and worse and worse\nwhile the pigs keep saying that it's actually getting\nbetter and better and better. Again, communism, same thing. The rationing is getting\nworse and worse and worse, less and less food, but\nthere's constant reporting that there's more and more food. We're winning! Hashtag. - I would argue that what\nyou've just described, it could be an identical\ndescription of what it feels like and what it means to go up Scientology's Bridge to Total Freedom. You are reinforcing to yourself that everything's getting\nbetter and better and better, and you'd be like, you don't spend time\nwith your family anymore. - Yeah. - You're broke, even though\nyou make a lot of money. You're always stressed. You're at the beck and\ncall of these people who seem to run your lives, like how a Scientologist\nfeels about their own life is, it's very interesting to compare that to how that person's life looks to their non-Scientology family members. - Mm-hmm. - I get contacted by a lot of people who've never been in Scientology, but they're like \"I got a\nfamily member who's really deep and I just, can you help\nme understand some things? Why is this person's life like this? Why is this person's life like this?\" So I don't wanna say that\nScientologists do not actually, I don't wanna say, \"Oh,\nit's all in their heads. They think they're being\nhelped, but they're really not.\" That doesn't feel honest, you know? But it's this thing where, if Scientology was just getting\nauditing when you wanted about the subjects you wanted and you could take it or\nleave it, that would be fine. It's the fact that it's part and parcel to this entire organization\nand this entire experience that has, as a part of that experience, taking everything from you, demanding everything from you, controlling who you can speak with, controlling who you can\nhave relationships with, who you have to erase from your life. This is where, and it's hard to, it's hard to place one pinpoint on \"This is where Scientology goes wrong.\" It's really hard to do that because the good parts of Scientology and the bad parts of Scientology\nare all just Scientology. - Yeah, so there's definition\nof what's bad for you, and it's probably, in the\nbeginning, is bad for you. This almost just sounds like a template of a toxic relationship. You know, there's a bunch\nof stuff in this world that is just not good for you, so the authoritarian says like, \"I'm just protecting\nyou by blocking you off from those negative things,\" and they're probably, they\nare probably negative things, but then this like, this\nfreedom starts closing in to where you can't no longer speak freely, think freely, act freely, and then there's some, I\nmean that's why sort of power corrupts and absolute\npower corrupts absolutely. That person doing the controlling actually starts getting that like dopamine rush of the\ncontroller, that's exciting, and it's a vicious negative cycle. So you start out as a, it starts out good 'cause you're trying to\ndo good for the person, but then it somehow goes to shit."

      "section": "Control",
      "text": "- [Aaron] Yeah. - So what are the aspects that just, that are often controlled, about a person who's in\nScientology, especially Sea Org? - Well, information control,\naccess to the internet, access to any information\ncritical of Scientology. - Is some internet access allowed? - Public Scientologist has no restrictions to their access to the internet, they're just not allowed to read anything critical of Scientology. - Oh, okay. So they're self, they're\nsupposed to self-control what they read or not, and\nwhat's the explanation? Is it always assumed that anything critical of Scientology is a lie? - Mm-hmm. They've really pushed this thing that unless you've been in a\nScientology organization yourself, or unless you've actually\nbeen a Scientologist, you couldn't possibly know\nthe truth about Scientology. If you're only getting information from people who aren't\nmembers or former members, then you couldn't possibly be getting the correct information. Now, they don't realize the\nmath there doesn't make sense. If you can find out the true information by becoming and being a Scientologist, then that means you can\nget the correct information from a former Scientologist, because they traveled that path and they got the correct information. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- So they still create this, they try to create this\nunfalsifiable loop, where unless you are personally doing it, you don't have correct information, and you go, \"Well, what about the people\nwho did personally do it, got the correct information, left, and are now sharing\nthat with others?\" \"Well, no, those are lies.\" \"Well, okay, so just anything\nyou don't like is a lie then?\" And you go \"Yeah, pretty much. That's kind of how it,\nthat's kinda how it works.\" - So what about the control\nof negative information on the internet? What, like the actual operations? I've, you know, preparing, I should admit, I don't know\ntoo much about Scientology, and I was doing a bunch of reading and the Wikipedia page on\nScientology, interestingly enough, is not that negative about Scientology. So like, it made me ask, you know, you have to\nbe a little bit careful how you consume stuff from Wikipedia. You have to consider, because\nmoney can buy things there, there's certain special\ninterests and so on, but like, it made me wonder, like with a lot of controversial topics, what is true and where do I look? Where do I go for truth? So like, how much sort\nof deliberate action is there to control what is true on the internet by Scientology? - Well, these days, they've pretty much, I think, thrown in the towel, but - [Lex] They have. - Scientology middle management\nwas editing Wikipedia so often from IP addresses that were traced back to\nthe Scientology buildings, that Wikipedia locked them\nout from any IP addresses associated with Scientology\nfrom being able to edit it. It's like Scientology was so infatuated with trying to control the information, and in the early days of the internet, they had a certain degree\nof success with that. They just, it's just hopeless these days. - It's the scale, the scale is not there, but actually, I'm very\nsurprised how bot farms, how effective that can\nbe at a very small scale. - [Aaron] Mm.\n- If you just pay a hundred people, just spread narratives, but the bad stuff, the reason that's effective\nis you can kind of create conspiracy\ntheories that create chaos and nobody knows what is true, that, bot farms can do, but actually really nicely\ncontrol a narrative is hard. So to create chaos, it's easier to do. To basically say like, you know, do PR control is very hard. Yeah, so especially, on the internet, especially\nwhen the critical eye is there, the internet can smell bullshit, which is one of the really,\nreally powerful things about the internet. - And I gotta tell you, it's one of the reasons\nI do my YouTube channel. It's one of the reasons I\ndecided to upload every day. I've uploaded every day\nfor the last six months. I just wanted there to be a\nnon-stop flow of information of any kind in any variety, as long as it's fair and balanced,\nintelligent, interesting, that Scientologists who\nstumble upon the internet will go, \"Oh, look, someone's\ntalking about my thing. Let's see what they got going on\" and \"Oh, I know this guy.\" The fact that Scientology\ncrushes so much information, before, before YouTube, before, like, I have the only like\nbig Scientology channel, and that only got big\nin the last six months. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - Okay, so before that, there were channels, there was things, but it's almost like it took a lot of, like people felt like it had took a lot of bravery and courage to like, say something on the\ninternet about Scientology, and so people would pop up and there weren't very many voices, and I was like, \"I want\nthis to be prolific.\" I want to be prolific. I want to have 30 or 40\nother channels being prolific so that Scientology couldn't possibly successfully control\nthe narrative about it. - Have you been personally attacked? - AaronSmithLevin.com is a website created by the Church of Scientology. Have you seen it? - No. What kind of content is on there? - Oh, \"Aaron's an abusive father and a horrible husband and the worst staff member we've ever had\" And, oh, I openly talk about it, because I think the fact that Scientology even does things like\nthat is fucking hilarious. - [Lex] Yeah. - And anything they try to do to me, I'm, the way I think about it is, you know you're just\ngiving me an opportunity to turn the mirror back on you and show everyone how horrible you are. - Does it stick? - [Aaron] No. - So you find that there is ineffective. - It's completely ineffective. They are so over the top, and well, I'll tell you how the website even came into being. So I was on the first season of \"Leah Remini: Scientology\nand the Aftermath.\" Every single person who\nparticipated in that show got a website. (Aaron laughing) It's just that everyone\nelse's website is like, WhoisMarkHeadley.com, WhoisMikeRinder.com. Well, I bought, WhoisAaronSmithLevin.com, but I was too stupid to buy Aaron, I didn't buy AaronSmithLevin.com, so I'm actually the only one who has a website in their name. - Oh, nice. - [Aaron] Yeah, and I'm like.\n- Dot com. - I can probably get a\nlawyer to get it back for me, but I'm like, \"Why?\" I want everyone to see\nwhat a nasty, petty, disgusting organization that this is, and nobody believes anything\nScientology says, anyway. - Does the general public know that it comes from Scientology? - Pull it up. It says right on the bottom, \"Copyright 2000, whatever, Church of Scientology International.\" Like they didn't even try to hide it. - So AaronSmithLevin.com. - Yeah. \"A man with no moral compass.\" - \"Aaron Smith, who is he really? Aaron Smith Levin, a man\nwith no moral compass. Read about Aaron Smith-Levin, an angry man spreading hate\nfrom the Internet's shadows.\" An open mouth shot. And you're saying like at the, wow, there's testimonies. - Oh, there's videos\nfrom former co-workers. - \"The slightest thing just sets him off and he just goes totally nuts.\" Well, that one is true. I didn't understand why you slapped me before the interview.\n(Aaron laughing) I felt that. - They've got links to\neveryone else's website on the bottom. It's so funny. - Who is?\nOkay. - [Aaron] But look like.\n- Leah Remini - 2021, Church of\nScientology International. All rights reserved. Here's an example of just Scientology's complete lack of self-awareness. So me and Mike Rinder, we went halfises on like a\nhouse flip project, right? You know?\n- Wait, Mike Rinder? - [Aaron] You know Mike Rinder. - Do I? You gave me a bobblehead of the guy. I don't know him. I just, I would like to\ntalk to him about them, but this, there's a\nvery fine gentleman here with a bobblehead. - The reason we created\nthat, the bobblehead. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Is because on Mike Rinder's hate site, Scientology created a gif or a gif, how do you say it? What's the right way to say it? - The correct way is gif. - Gif, good.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Scientology created a gif of\nMike Rinder as a bobblehead. It was an insult, like \"Oh, all he does is sit\nnext to Leah Remini and go 'Yes, Leah, yes, Leah,'\" and so they made a gif\nof him with a bobblehead. So we were like, \"We're gonna\nmake Mike Rinder bobbleheads and we're gonna sell ''em on theSPshop.com to raise money for The\nAftermath Foundation. - [Lex] I love it.\n- Yeah, and now that I've. - [Lex] So go out and buy. - Yeah, go to theSPshop.com and get yourself a Mike Rinder bobblehead. Now look, now that my profile's\ngetting a little higher, this head was made to bobble like this. - [Lex] Yeah. - This smooth, shiny head\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Needs its own bobblehead now. - It does, it 100% does. I can't believe it doesn't exist. - So, but let me show you, so here's what's happening here. We just hired some day\nlaborers off of what, like Craigslist or something? - [Lex] Yeah. - So what Scientology did was they had a private\ninvestigator stake out the house flip project. They were clearly running license plates of anyone who visited the property, because otherwise, how would they find out the laborer's names, look,\ndo background checks on them. - [Lex] Yeah. - To find out they had criminal records, and they published this as if it's gonna reflect negatively on me. - [Lex] Yeah. - Oh, we hired someone to do\nwork who had a criminal record? Who gives a shit? You know, one of the biggest problems people with records have\nis finding employment. - [Lex] Yeah. - There's nothing bad about hiring someone who's got a criminal record. It doesn't reflect negatively on me. - [Lex] Wait.\n- But it shows you what they think about those people. It shows you what they think about people who are trying to put\ntheir lives back together and maybe, you know,\nactually work for a living, and it also shows that\nthey're surveilling us. Like they don't realize\nthat, putting this up, they're publishing information\nthat they could only have if they're surveilling me and Mike, and it doesn't occur to them, \"Maybe we shouldn't put that up.\" - Just the general process,\nsad to say, of journalism where they're looking\nfor any kind of dirt, and it's, they're trying\nto conjure up a story and there's something about\ndrama and negative stories that get clicks and so on. So this is a general process. The more, especially the\nmore celebrity you become, the more these kinds of attacks come, and they look for any kind\nof thing that could be, you know, it doesn't\neven have to be facts, it could be just asking\n\"Who is he really?\" seems to have traction on the internet. - [Aaron] Yeah. - What is the actual truth of the man you keep claiming you are, of the good man you keep claiming you are? - [Aaron] Right. - It's fascinating, but\nsometimes it can be effective. But I think if you're being\ntransparent and authentic and just putting yourself out there completely in your story, completely, then that's the best way to fight it. - That's the other reason to be prolific on the internet, right? The reason Joe Rogan can't get canceled is because anyone can\nwatch thousands of hours of the authentic Joe Rogan. You can't misrepresent him, 'cause he spent thousands of hours representing himself genuinely. - Yeah. The nice thing, when you're\nrepresenting yourself genuinely, you should be a good person, so if you're a good person,\nthen the internet will know. - Yeah."

      "section": "David Miscavige",
      "text": "- They can smell out the bullshit. Who is David Miscavige? It's even like, 'cause\nyou said L. Ron Hubbard founded Scientology. - [Aaron] Yeah. - Let's go to the story\nof how we transitioned from that to David Miscavige. - The current leader of Scientology, he was actually not selected\nby L. Ron Hubbard to take over, but ended up usurping\npower and taking over. - This sounds like Stalin and Trotsky and communism, similar story. It's the person, oftentimes\nin these situation, it's not the natural successor to power, it's the one that takes power. - Right. I think the quote, sometime it gets attributed\nto David Miscavige, is \"Power is not given, it is assumed.\" - Yeah.\n- Something like that. The last six years of\nL. Ron Hubbard's life, he was off into seclusion,\nessentially hiding from lawsuits. Now, by the time Hubbard\nwent off into seclusion, Miscavige had sort of already risen up through the ranks of the Sea Organization. Now Miscavige was like a teenager, either like 11, 12, 13\nor something like that. Miscavige was not born into Scientology, but he was a young, a young boy when his father got into Scientology. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- Okay. So Miscavige did start\nworking as a Sea Org member, So there's one organization that existed to essentially serve Hubbard directly and to represent his interests, and that was called \"The Commodore.\" He was the Commodore of\nthe Sea Organization, the Commodore's Messengers Organization. We're gonna call it the CMO. Miscavige started working\nfor the CMO pretty early on in his Sea Org career, by\nthe way, as did Mike Rinder. Mini Mike. Okay.\n(Aaron laughing) And so, he just became known as a doer, like a guy who will get it done. No excuses, no stops,\nyou know, get it done. So he had made a name\nfor himself in the CMO around the time, by the time Hubbard went off into seclusion. Now, when he went off in his seclusion, he took two other CMO, I'm\ngonna call them Messengers, right, Commodore's Messengers. He took two other messengers with him, Pat and Annie Broker. Now, it has been said by people, Mike, Mike Rinder has told me, he goes, \"The reason Pat\nand Annie went off with LRH isn't necessarily because he\ndesperately wanted them to, but partly because we could\nafford to let them go. We didn't necessarily need them.\" - Sure, sure. - Okay, and between the two of them, Annie was the one who was like a really compassionate\nperson, intelligent person, caring person. - Was there a possible\ntrajectory of this world where she was the one that took over? - Yes. In fact, Pat and Annie Broker were the two people that were\nsupposed to take over. Okay. But because Pat and Annie were\nwith Hubbard in seclusion, Miscavige basically had the complete run of the operation without\nany oversight from Hubbard. The only way any information would get from Scientology world to Hubbard is Miscavige and Pat Broker would meet at a confidential location and Miscavige would give Broker any information\nhe wanted to go to LRH. So if Miscavige wanted\nto get rid of somebody, all he had to do was feed\nLRH false information that this person was doing, had been caught doing\nsomething treasonous, and then he would get, in response, some order from L. Ron Hubbard\nto get rid of this person. So are there so many similarities between various communist\nregimes and fascist regimes? - Well, Hitler did the same thing when he became the supreme leader. He had to take power. Yeah. He had to wait for the president to die, but the whole time there's\na control of information and a slow aggregation of power. Of course with nations is different, 'cause if you control the\nmilitary, you control a lot. So there's, you have to\nalso get the Generals on your side and so on, but I'm sure, in this situation there is similar kind of dynamics. You have to get certain\npeople on your side, control the flow of information, let the original founder,\nthe original leader, die off. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And make sure that you are the one that's left with the power. - Right. So whereas Pat and Annie are off with LRH, all of Scientology's\nattorneys and accountants and lobbyists and whatever,\nthey all know Dave. Dave's the one they deal with. So you know, LRH passes away. Pat and Annie make this appearance. Nobody knows Pat and Annie, everybody knows Dave, and so he ended up getting\nrid of Pat and Annie. This is a very short, perhaps slightly\nbastardized version of it, of Miscavige, basically, they had been ushering\njust suitcases of cash to L. Ron Hubbard during this time, and you know, Pat like,\nso you have Miscaviage handing boatloads of cash to Pat Broker. Pat would do crazy things like hide the money in the walls of houses and dig pits and everything, so Miscavige basically\nthreatened to turn Pat Broker over to the IRS for tax evasion. That's, Pat Broker's still alive. - Is he a Scientologist or no? - No, he basically went away\nand kept his mouth shut. - [Lex] What about Annie? - She died a handful of years ago. She stayed a loyal Sea Org\nmember until the very end, but literally like Miscavige\nput her on menial tasks like, like she had no authority whatsoever. She was just put on menial tasks. I mean, washing dishes, but\nnot really groundskeeper, just, just stupid low-level\nassistant, paper-pusher stuff. She never operated with\nany actual authority, even though she was supposed\nto be the one to take over, her and Pat. - So on David Miscavige, difficult question, but\ncan you make both the case that he is a good man who is misunderstood and the case that he's not a good man? - First of all, I believe that Miscavige is a true believer in Scientology. I do believe that. - [Lex] That's a really\nimportant question. - Yeah. - Do you think he believes\nin all the thetans and all of that? - He definitely believes in that. I think he believes in Scientology, but in a different way than\nall other Scientologists, because he's aware of\na lot more information. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Damaging information about L. Ron Hubbard and the\ntrue story of Scientology than most people, so his\nversion of belief is different. I'll give you one example here. So Scientology's Bridge to Total Freedom goes up to what they call OT eight, operating thetan level eight. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- Okay. Scientologists have all been\ntold that L. Ron Hubbard, before he passed, finished, completed, putting together 0T 9, 10,\n11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, it's just sitting in the\nvault waiting to be released. This is part of the\nScientology belief system, because remember I said going up Scientology's\nBridge to Total Freedom is how you're supposed to get back to your native, God-like state. Well, all the Scientologists in the world who've already done OT eight know that they haven't gotten there, but they still believe in Scientology because they're told there's more. \"But wait, there's more!\" - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- Miscavige knows there is no more. So Miscavige knows the fundamental promise of being able to achieve full\noperating thetan is a lie. He knows L. Ron Hubbard\ndidn't accomplish that, so therefore, no one else is\ngoing to accomplish it as well. If L. Ron Hubbard had accomplished it, Miscavige knows, well\nhe didn't write it up. He didn't leave instructions for how anyone else would accomplish it, so no matter what, Miscavige knows that\nthe fundamental promise, what Scientology is\nsaying they will be able to deliver to mankind is a lie. Now, it's gonna sound like\nI'm contradicting myself, 'cause it sounds like I'm saying \"Well he knows it's bullshit.\" I think he believes that L. Ron Hubbard just failed to finish his work and he's kind of hoping L.\nRon Hubbard's gonna come back to finish the job, 'cause L. Ron Hubbard did tell the people at the international management base, at least a core of them,\nthat he was coming back. Now, we know that David\nMiscavige believed this, because right around the 21 year mark, he was supposed to come back\nlike 21 years after he died, right around the 21 year mark, David Miscavige was getting busy putting some things in\nplace that had to get done in case L. Ron Hubbard came back. So we know he at least\nbelieved to that level. - Did he believe that like L. Ron Hubbard can sort\nof enter his own body? - [Aaron] No, that's not\nhow it works in Scientology. - Okay, so you can't have\na transfer of thetans? - If you were full OT, you could. - Can you describe the OT again? So OT levels, OT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to the 8. What are they? What's, how do you get to level one? - I'm gonna answer this question by first connecting some dots. - [Lex] Yes.\n- Okay. We spoke earlier in the interview about achieving your native, God-like - [Lex] Yes.\n- State. That, in Scientology,\nis called native state. Okay, native state and\nfull operating thetan mean the exact same thing. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- Okay, because at native state, you\nare a fully operating thetan. You know, operating meaning\noperating in your full capacity, so OT means operating thetan. So the upper confidential\nhalf of Scientology's Bridge are called the OT levels,\nthe operating thetan levels, and these, and remember,\nthey're confidential, so most Scientologists\nhave not done these levels. They don't know what's on them. It is on these levels that you learn about the Xenu and the body thetan story."

      "section": "Xenu",
      "text": "- Can you describe Xenu please? - We spoke earlier about how at the lower non-confidential levels\nof Scientology's Bridge, Hubbard's saying that\nwhat's wrong with you is your reactive mind. - [Lex] Yes.\n- Okay. Well in Scientology, once you've gotten rid\nof your reactive mind, that is what's called\nthe \"State of Clear.\" - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - Okay, so after you've\nfinished State of Clear, the next thing on the\nBridge is the OT levels. Well, if you've already gotten\nrid of your active mind, what the heck are you supposed to do now? Well now L. Ron Hubbard says, \"Okay, first what was wrong with you was just your reactive mind, but now the next thing\nyou have to resolve, the next thing that's wrong with you, is you actually have tens\nof thousands of thetans stuck to your body, and they all have their\nown reactive minds. - [Lex] Oh, wow. - You have to audit the thetans. - How do you audit the thetans? Are these like different\nshades of your inner mind and you just have to try\nto access them somehow? - You use the E-meter,\njust like we spoke about, except now, you've got a\ndivider that separates the cans so they don't short circuit and you hold both cans in one hand and you have the E-meter in front of you, so now you're auditing yourself. You are telepathically\ntalking to the thetans that are stuck to you. You are thinking the commands instead of saying them out loud, and you sort of do\ndrills where you practice looking for E-meter reads at\nthe instant you have a thought. You are telepathically auditing spirits that L. Ron Hubbard says\nare stuck to your body. Does this sound like a recipe\nfor a mental breakdown? - Or a heck of a mental journey. Wherever that leads,\nit could lead anywhere. It probably could lead to\na very bad place, right? - It very often does. And you combine that with the fact that Scientology is against any forms of mental help or health\noutside of Scientology, and you have a recipe for disaster. Now you might go, \"Where did all these spirits come from that are stuck to your body?\" This is where Xenu comes into play. So Hubbard says that 75 million years ago, Xenu was basically a dictator at, the Galactic Confederation\nis like 70 something or 80 something planets, sits\nsomewhere in the Milky Way, and Xenu was like a dictator, an overlord, for either one of these\nplanets or the whole system, and they had a population problem, and Xenu was like, \"We need to get rid of\nlike half the people, so we called them all in for tax audits.\" L. Ron Hubbard didn't like the IRS, so of course, the story\nhas to do with tax audits. Okay, called ''em all in for tax audits. Said \"Psyche, bitches!\" Froze them in glycol, loaded\nthem up on space planes, flew them to Earth. Remember, the story has to be earth, because the story is what's wrong with us. Flew them to earth,\ndropped them in volcanoes, blew them up with hydrogen bombs, and then captured them\nwith like spirit magnets. I'm making up words 'cause, okay. - [Lex] Okay. - And these disembodied\nspirits of these people that got blown up have just\nbeen blowin' in the wind here on Earth, and they\nattach themselves to things and they can be in the environment and they stick to bodies and everything, and so, and they all have reactive minds. So at Scientology's upper levels, if you get sick or you have cancer or there's something wrong with you, Scientology will say \"That's\none of your body things. You need to get some auditing\nto fix the body thing.\" - So this story, you do it with\na kind of bit of a chuckle, but when done seriously, so\nit's just told in a serious way, like or written down? - [Aaron] It's written down.\n- And you read it? - By most accounts,\nScientologists struggle when they read this for the first time, because this is not consistent with what Scientologists are hoping\nfor is on the OT levels, they're hoping for some\nreal life-changing magic. - [Lex] Yeah. - The way these things\nare described and sold, they're, remember, they're\nhoping that these OT levels are gonna make them, give them the ability to go like completely independent\nof their body at will. - [Lex] Yeah. - Esterize from your body,\ngo back into your body, you know, like have\nsome real spirit powers. - So first is kind of a shock, this is, but then you still\nprobably believe, you hope. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And you might turn on yourself\nself-critical that this is, \"I'm just not strong enough yet.\" - Yeah, also part of the Scientology, remember, it works 100% of the time when used 100% correctly, and if it doesn't, it could be because something's\nnot being done right, but it also could be because\nyou're doing bad things that you're not telling people about. Like if you're committing\npresent time over its crime sins, Scientologists would be like, \"That's part of the reason\nauditing isn't working on you is because you're\ncommitting criminal behavior that you're not being honest about.\" So every Scientologist\nis sort of incentivized to make auditing work on them, okay? Now Lex, this is where\nit gets a little crazy. On OT three, you learn about the OT, the body thetans for the first time. When you finish OT three, you attest to having achieved this state of having no more body thetans. And then you start OT four, and he is like \"Psyche! You got more! You got more BT's! Except those other BT's,\nthey had drug problems, and that's why you couldn't\nfind ''em the first time. So we're gonna do a something\na little different here, do something a little different here, gotta get rid of these BT's\nthat were addicted to drugs.\" Okay? Then you finish OT four\nand you're thinking \"Man, I hope we get to\nthe good stuff soon,\" and then you get to OT five and he is like \"Psyche! You got more BT's! You couldn't find these BT's 'cause they were all bunched\nup together in clusters, and first you have to\nbreak up the clusters, and then you can get rid of the BT's.\" and you're like, \"Okay, gotta do that.\" - And this was all L.\nRon Hubbard approved? - Yeah, this is from L. Ron Hubbard. And then, after you finish OT five, you get rid of all the BT clusters, OT six is just a training course to teach you how to audit OT seven. Well, OT seven is now more BT's, except it's in the environment and stuff. You're trying to locate BT's. You can find ''em on your\nbody, but it's just more BT's. Okay, and then OT eight is,\nremember we talked about, in all these auditing sessions throughout the entire Scientology Bridge, you have people who've\nrun hundreds or thousands of past-life whole track incidents. These memories have become\npart of their self-identity, of who they even think they are. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- OT eight, you go through all\nthese past life recalls, and essentially, I'm\noversimplifying this a little bit, he goes, \"Psyche! All those past life\nmemories weren't yours. They were your BT's.\" And he goes, \"Now that\nyou've discovered this, now you know who you are not, and you are ready to find\nout who you really are.\" Well now, you're supposed to\nfind out who you really are on OT nine and 10. Those don't exist! - Do we know they don't exist? - Yes. In fact, the whole story\nof how that became known. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Is part of how David Miscavige was able\nto get rid of Pat Broker and take over power, because it was believed\nthat Pat Broker had been, was in possession of the\nupper unreleased OT levels, and when Miscavige\ndetermined that he was not, and there weren't in fact any levels, that was bad, that was a bad\nday to be David Miscavige, 'cause he now knew he had\nsomething on his hands he could not get himself out of. He's like, \"Oh, shit.\" - So there's no gap for faith to seep in that there is a level\nnine and 10, 11 and 12? - Oh, the faith is there. Scientologists believe\nthat these things do exist. - [Lex] Yeah. - L. Ron Hubbard didn't\nleave anything behind. - Does David Miscavige believe they exist? - Oh no, he knows, he knows they don't exist. No meaning when I say exist. Oh, I don't mean do advanced levels of spiritual awareness exist? When I said is, I mean, did L. Ron Hubbard write down\nwhat anyone is supposed to do - [Lex] Yeah.\nThat's called OT nine? That doesn't exist. - So you're saying\nDavid Miscavige believes that they can be written\ndown so they exist, sort of in a platonic sense, and L. Ron Hubbard is the only one that can write it down? - [Aaron] Yes. So his faith is really deep? - Oh, you mean his faith\nthat only L. Ron Hubbard could have ever been the one to do it? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Yes. The full principles,\nbeliefs of Scientology. He is, do you have, are\nyou sure he believes? - About what exactly? - Everything about Scientology? That it's true? - To the best of my ability to know that, I believe it to be true. Like, I'll give you small\nand even stupid examples, like Mike Rinder's told a story where, at the international base, Miscavige actually had like a copper, a contraption built into the ground, like grounded into the ground, to come out where you could hold it and hear something he sort of came up with to your BT, it could ground your BT's, could get your BT's that, if you were feeling\noverstimulated or something, I'm probably slightly\nbastardizing this story, but he came up with this as a great idea, of something to help someone de-stimulate if their BT's were getting\na little too overactive use. Now, so that, that's a stupid\nstory that's sort of like, well it shows you he believes\nin the concept of BT's if he's creating little\nrods to get rid of them, to ground them into the earth. - Well, he could be\nconjuring up the stories because he understands the\npower of myth and narrative and so on to, to inspire - [Aaron] Sure. To, but like, but also\nif we look at history, both with, this is the interesting thing, because I've been reading a\nlot about Hitler and Stalin and it seems like both of\nthem, in different ways, believed in the stories\nthey we're telling, even when the stories,\nthis is the fascinating, especially with Hitler and propaganda, where they were literally\nconjured up at first. - [Aaron] Hmm. - But then you start to\nbelieve you're own propaganda. With Stalin, I think\nwhat he always believed is the bigger ideal of pure communism and anything justifies\nthe journey to communism because it will ultimately\nbe good for humanity to achieve the state of pure communism, and then, he's a God-like figure that can bring humanity there, but like with Hitler, it's\ninteresting because like, there's constant propaganda\nthat he knows is not true, a little bit, there's gotta be doubt, but then he like did, all\ndoubt was removed very quickly. - [Aaron] Yeah. - So I guess humans are just,\nthis is how they operate. - Yeah. The conversation about David Miscavige gets really interesting,\nbecause I could give you a, if I wanted to make the\nargument that he didn't believe, I could give you a dozen\nexamples to make that argument. - [Lex] Yeah. I just happen to think that he believes in a different way. - [Lex] Yeah. - Whereas your average Scientologist believes that L. Ron Hubbard\nwas practically infallible, that he thought of everything in advance, he took care of everything before he left, and Miscavige still believes in like the main structure of\nthis thing, but he's like, \"Oh she, it's befalling\nto me to figure out how to actually make this thing happen.\" I think Miscavige sees\nhimself as someone who has, to a certain degree, had to go back and fix L. Ron Hubbard's mistakes. - Do you think he sees himself\nas doing good for the world? - [Aaron] I do. - What about for the\npeople of Scientology? - I think, in his own way, he does. I don't think he wakes up thinking he's screwing Scientologists. I think he sees everyone\nelse as screwing him. I think he sees that it is his job to expand Scientology throughout the world and accomplish the aims of Scientology, and he sees that it's not happening, and he thinks if everyone\nelse would just stop, if everyone else would get out of his way and stop creating problems\nfor him, it would happen. Like I do think he seems to sees himself as someone who is doing good. I think that's fair to say. I think the evidence shows that. - What about the effects of, clearly power and influence\nthat he's had, and money? - Yeah. Without question, that has\nserved as a corrupting force. - It has?\n- Without question. - Have you seen sort of evidence of that, that he's changed over time? - After the 1993 IRS exemption\nthat Scientology won back, and this information\ncomes from Mike Rinder, that's when David Miscavige, as soon as the checks on\nhis power were removed, Miscavige's behavior changed markedly. - Can you tell the story\nof Shelly Miscavige and the mystery surrounding her? I saw that there is\nquite a bit of mystery. - Yeah. So Shelly Miscavige, for many years, held the job of, her post\nin the Sea Organization was David Miscavige's assistant. That was her post. It's important to truly understand\nthat and what that means, because the fact that\nshe was Miscavige's wife is meaningless, and this is\nsomething that's hard to, for regular people in the\nregular world to truly grasp how meaningless it is in Scientology, for Sea members who are spouses. It means nothing. - Your role matters more within Sea org. - Your role's the only thing that matters. So let's say, let's say if\nShelly was married to Dave, but she worked in a\ndifferent organization, she would never be seen with\nhim, ever publicly, ever. Wouldn't travel with him. Wouldn't go to events with him. Nothing. Sometime around 2006, 2007, and I'm very oversimplifying this, okay, Shelly basically pissed off Dave to the point where he's like,\n\"Okay, I'm done with you. I'm gonna take you off of your post.\" Okay, at that point, she was reassigned to another\nconfidential Scientology base up in Twin Peaks, California. Why am I, the reason I'm\nproviding this type of detail is because we hear that Shelly's missing. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Okay. Well you realize the\nsame people who report that Shelly's missing\nare also the same people who will tell you exactly where she is? Okay, she works at this secretive CST, Church of Spiritual Technology base out in Twin Peaks, California. I have personal confirmation\nthat she was seen and spoken with by someone\nwho knew her well in, I'll say 2019. Shelly Miscavige is missing in the sense that she's hasn't been seen with David Miscavige\nsince about 2006, but because she's no longer his assistant, you would never see her with him. - As opposed to like\nthe mystery of a person that might be murdered? This is more of reallocation\nwithin the organization. - Yes, certain people\nwho cover Scientology who have published stories\nwhere Shelly Miscavige's family member told a story\nto another family member who told the story to a friend who told the story to\na former Scientologist who told the story to a journalist who published the story, has created the impression\nthat some of Shelly Miscavige's family members are actually\ntalking to the press, when in fact, that has never occurred. And so the very people who are publishing about Shelly Miscavige missing\nhave contributed to the fact that Shelly Miscavige does no longer speak to those family members because she thinks they're talking to the\npress when they never have. It's pretty messed up. - It's sad that she, 'cause\nthose family members, what, would be a way for her to recover, to flourish as a human being? To escape? - Yeah. So I believe the information\nthat I have that I've verified, I'm putting out inform, I'm the one representing it's true without revealing my sources. - [Lex] Sure. - That Shelly was still\nactively in touch regularly with family members outside\nof the Sea Organization until about 2014. So I mean regularly. Okay, so there's no\nquestion about her safety during that period, and then someone else\nwho knew Shelly very well did see her and actually\nhave a conversation with her in a public place in 2019 or 2020. Now, somebody could still\ncome along and be like, \"How do we know she's okay? It's been three years.\" Yeah, okay, you could\nsay that about anybody. You know, there's a, the nature of working in the highest levels of\nScientology management at these super secretive bases. It's a very weird and unique situation. - [Lex] Yeah. - It has isolation baked in."

Like, it's hard to leak information. - Oh, they wouldn't wanna leak. They're true believers. They see, they see, like there's a, there's sort of a conspiracy theory that runs right through\nall of Scientology, which is that Scientology represents like an existential threat to the powers that really control this planet. - Do they have a face to the\npowers that really control? Do they have names to it? Like who's controlling? - It's Xenu's homies? - Well, I'm sure that's not what they say. Xenu embodied in? - It's actually sort of\na multifaceted conspiracy in that, on the one hand, L. Ron Hubbard points his fingers at like the international bankers. - [Lex] Okay. - Which has shades of anti-Semitism to it. - Yeah. And then the IRS is some is going to be quickly baked in or no? - The IRS, no. The IRS is so low on the totem pole. - [Lex] Oh. - As far as the, I mean\nthe international bankers, he would say runs everything. - [Lex] Got it.\n- But use, that these bankers also use big pharma and big psych to control the population, and Scientology's famously\nagainst pharma and psych, and so this is sort of how\nL. Ron Hubbard characterizes like this big war between Scientology that's trying to set everyone free. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And big pharma and big psych that's trying to enslave\neveryone on the planet. - Yeah. Controlling their mind, controlling their body through chemicals. - And who controls the press? Big pharma and big psych. - So there's a lot of correlation to other kinds of conspiracy theories? - [Aaron] Yeah. - Wow, that's fascinating. - But you asked a question where, why would all these people\nhold onto their stories? They don't, they would never wanna leak, like by even, anyone\nwho would want to leak would not not even wanna\nbe a Scientologist anymore. Like if you truly believe, if you truly believe in Scientology, and you got your shoulder to the wheel and you're a Sea Org member, you think Scientology is\nliterally the only thing that can save every being on this planet from a fate of eternal\namnesia and slavery. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Right? And so it's like, I mean, you've seen \"The Matrix,\" right? So you've got everyone, once you're unplugged from the matrix and you realize, yeah, you\ncould get plugged back in and live your nice life,\nbut you're a slave, that's how Scientologists see this planet. They actually, they they refer\nto earth as a prison planet. - Just on an individual level, how's it possible to\nreach a person like that? Like is there something\nyou could say to that? Like what's the journey of\nreaching a person like that? - I personally, because\nwhen I was in those shoes, I say there's nothing\nanybody could have said to me to get me to change how I felt and thought about Scientology. It's almost foolproof. - [Lex] Yeah. - That the more evidence\nyou try to present, that there's something wrong\nwith what Scientology is doing, the more you're just\nworking for the psychs. - [Lex] Yeah. - You know, it's very, very difficult. I mean, most people who leave Scientology leave because they have had\nsome personal experience that was just such a grave injustice that it just pushed them beyond the point of what they were willing to experience. Very rare, I've never, I'm\nnot sure I've really ever heard a story of someone\ngoing, \"Yeah, I just woke up. You know, I just gradually\nrealized it was all BS and drifted away.\" You know, it's usually like, \"No, I really believed and\nthey treated me so horribly, I almost had no choice but to leave\" and then the stories get pretty crazy. - Meaning you don't care\nwhat's true anymore, you just have to leave? - [Aaron] Yeah. - Just the unpleasant\nfeeling, the suffering. - Yeah. And this sort of goes back to\nthe conversation we're having about like, \"Well does\nMiscavige really believe?\" and I said I could make\nan argument for the fact that he doesn't, right, because I go, it wouldn't be that hard to change the way Scientology treats people. Just a little bit, and you'd\nprobably stop losing anyone, because Scientologists already believe to such a strong degree.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - You have to be pretty\nfreaking horrible to people to make them leave. And that's where you go, \"Well does Miscavige even\nwant Scientology to expand?\" because if he was really\nbeing clever about it, it seems like he could at\nleast stop the bleeding and yet he doesn't, so that's where you make the argument, \"Well, if he doesn't then\nhe must not want to.\" - So his mind is corrupted to\nthe point where he's not able to actually be a good\nbusinessman, essentially? - It seems that way. The numbers of Scientologists\nhave been going down and down and down since the early 90's. - Is there a good, I mean, it's very difficult to get to this number, but is there a good estimate\nof what the current number of Scientologists,\npracticing Scientologists is? - Oh yeah, I did a video about this. It's actually quite easy\nto get to the number. It's not more than 35,000\nin the entire world, and that's being very\ngenerous and charitable. That's, I was intentionally generous. I broke it all down in a\nspreadsheet and everything. - Yeah, what, can you\ngive like some insights of how you get that information? - Sure, there's about 175 to\n200 Scientology organizations in the world. Anybody who's ever worked\nat these organizations know there's not more than 35\nto 50 staff members per org. There's not more than 100 to 200 public Scientologists per org. I broke down the number of Sea Org members who'd be working at every\ncontinental management unit, middle management,\ninternational management. I broke down the mission\nnetwork, and I was generous. I mean, my numbers were like\nif L. Ron Hubbard came back and they were doing an event. - [Lex] Yeah. - L. Ron Hubbard was coming back and announcing OT nine and 10, how many Scientologists\ncould we scrape together in every city to come to this event? It wasn't more than 35,000. Now, contrast that to\nwhat Scientology says, millions, 10 million people. - Is this less people\nthan there used to be? - Yeah, at its peak it was\nabout 100,000 active members. - [Lex] But never the millions? - Never.\nNo."

      "text": "- Has David Miscavige used violence? Has there, in your understanding\nof it, in your estimation, sort of harassment, assault and actual, I don't know how to define\nassault, but violence? - Oh, yeah. Dozens of former Sea Org members\nfrom the international base have told stories of being\nassaulted by Miscavige. In fact, Mike Rinder is\nprobably the one person who's been assaulted by\nMiscavige more than anyone else. He's personally probably been\nassaulted dozens of times. - Who is Mike Rinder? The man here. - One of the highest ranking\nexecutives in Scientology. - He's an author. - There you go, \"A Billion Years.\" - Oh, \"A Billion Years.\" - It really is a fantastic book, 'cause Lex, the guy was born\nand raised in Scientology and worked personally with L. Ron Hubbard and worked personally with\nDavid Miscavige for decades, like doesn't get much\nmore insider than that. - \"A candid and deeply\nfelt memoir of a life lost to false belief and\ncourageously regained.\" Lawrence Wright. \"A Billion Years: My Escape From a Life in the Highest Ranks of Scientology.\" Mike Rinder. - It's a fantastic book. He also narrates his own audio book, too. I know you like the audio books. That's how I listen to them. - Yeah. - So Mike famously, you know,\nI just said a moment ago, like someone who's treated so horribly, even though he still\nbelieved in Scientology that he had no choice but to leave, and he tells the story in that book and he still believed in Scientology for years after he escaped, for years, 'cause there's this thing called the Independent Scientology Movement or the Free Zone or whatever, there are people who do Scientology outside of the Church of Scientology. There's just not many of them, but Mike was one of those people who was actually doing\nScientology even after he left. Now he no longer believes in that anymore and he doesn't do it, but even though he still believed, even though everything he knew was what he was leaving behind, he still had to leave it behind. - And by the way, I just\nopened to a random page, and he says, \"When I signed on for Sea Org in Adelaide in 1973, the recruiter promised I would train as a Scientology executive under the direct tutelage\nof Hubbard on the Apollo.\" So this is another thing I\nshould probably ask you about. - [Aaron] Oh, we could go for days. - \"I was also told that after I learned all I needed to learn at\nthe foot of the master, I would return to Australia\nto help expand Scientology in my home country.\" So what was the thing\nthat really broke him? - The final thing is\nwhen he got to a point where he was no longer being forced to lie to protect L. Ron Hubbard, he was now being forced to lie\nto protect David Miscavige. - [Lex] Yeah. - And specifically, it\nwas about the allegations of having been assaulted by Miscavige. Mike Rinder was at some event, it might have been a grand\nopening for a building, a Scientology building in London, and I believe it was John Sweeney, at that time, a BBC journalist who, you know, stuck a camera in\na microphone in Mike's face, \"Is it true David Miscavige assaulted you? Is it true?\" and Mike denied it on camera, and then turned around\nand to himself was like, \"This is what my life has been reduced to? Lying to protect David Miscavige? This used to be about L. Ron Hubbard. This used to be about Scientology.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - \"Now it's about\nprotecting this douche bag?\" And Miscavige had just issued orders that was gonna send Mike off to Australia. Miscavige, like Miscavige is sadistic. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - That is without question. - Sadistic meaning? - He enjoys inflicting pain upon others. So he very specifically\nwas gonna tell Mike, tell Rinder, or \"Tell that cocksucker we're shipping him off to Australia. He's never gonna see his\nwife and his kids again,\" essentially, and that's\nwhen Mike was like, \"They were the only reason\nI hadn't already left.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So if I follow the orders, I'm gonna lose them. If I leave Scientology,\nI'm gonna lose them, but at least if I leave Scientology, I'll be free of something. It's fuckin' sad. - And he still believed\nScientology to some degree after he left? - Yeah.\n- Is what you're saying? - Yeah. - Has he spoken about what it took to let go of believing in Scientology? - Yeah. He does a very good job\ntalking about all of this in the book, and it took him, it took\nhim like four or five years to get that book done, like, it's a polished version. It's a polished version of his story, and I think Mike's about getting ready to start his own YouTube channel, so that'll be a lot of fun. Actually, Mike comes on\nmy channel all the time. - Yeah, you guys do a\nthing together, right? - Yeah, we do \"The Three Amigos\" with me and Mike Rinder and Mark Hadley. (Aaron laughing) That's why I gave you Mark's book, 'cause I thought maybe you would know him from our little \"Three Amigos,\" our \"Mondays with Mike and Mark\" videos. Mark Hadley, \"Blown for Good: Behind the\nIron Curtain of Scientology.\" - So he escaped from the\ninternational base on a motorcycle. It's a wild story. I won't even try to do it justice, but. - Who's a better writer\nof the two of them? (Aaron laughing) - You're not gonna get me there, Lex. - I'm trying to be an\ninvestigative journalists once. - Mike and Mark are both on the board of The Aftermath Foundation with me. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - So.\n- Who's better looking? (Aaron laughing)\n- No, I'm just kidding. - It's one of my justifications for just putting up content every day is every video is just an excuse to, in some little way, promote\nThe Aftermath Foundation, and I do that, again, one to\ngenuinely help people escape, and two, 'cause I know it\ndrives David Miscavige crazy. - If you look in your own\nheart, is there anger there? - I don't think it's anger. I don't hate, I don't hate Scientology. I don't hate David Miscavige. I don't even hate my\nexperience in Scientology. - So you are able to accept the good? - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- From your experience? - Yeah, absolutely, but it's also the only\npath that I traveled. - [Lex] Right.\n- So I tend, okay, a little less so these\ndays, but earlier in life, I tended to attribute all\nmy positive characteristics in me to Scientology, 'cause in my simplistic way of thinking, I was like, \"What else could\nit possibly be attributed to?\" - [Lex] Right. - That's a very black and\nwhite way of seeing it. - That's a beautiful way to see life. No matter what happens to you, you attribute, like you\nfocus on the positive. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And you feel like if\nsometimes people have traumatic experiences with parents and so on. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And if you focus on the positive, it's a good way to let go.\n- [Aaron] Right. - Of the trauma associated with it. - True, but like another example would be like, I didn't go to school, Lex. I stopped going to school\nin the seventh grade, but people go, \"But you sound so smart\" and what am I supposed to do, am I supposed to say, \"Well\nit's 'cause of Scientology,\" like how do I answer that question? Like, if it's the only path I traveled, - [Lex] Yeah. - How do I answer that question? I don't necessarily wanna\ngive Scientology credit, but what the hell am I\nsupposed to point to? - [Lex] Sure.\n- You know? - I mean, you said\nthere's, you kind of enjoy, I mean part of it is\nyou joking and trolling, that you enjoy knowing\nthat your YouTube channel drives David Miscavige crazy. I mean, that means you still, I mean, there is a joy you have, right? - There is a joy. I'm not gonna deny that. - I don't know what to make of that, 'cause there's a, I\nsuppose there's an intimacy when you're part of a tribe of that kind. - It's almost like, let me try to, let me try to frame it."

      "text": "I wasn't trying to get\nkicked out of Scientology. I was trying to not get\nkicked out of Scientology. I, you know, so what happened first, first my mom got kicked out for basically talking some\nsmack about David Miscavige, and then they go to me and they go, \"Okay, you've gotta\ndisconnect from your mom or you're gonna get kicked out,\" and I lied about that, and I was like, \"Okay, I'll\ndisconnect,\" but I never did. For a couple years. I\nlied my ass off about it. Eventually they were like, \"This guy's gonna keep\nlying to us,\" right, and they're like, \"Yeah,\nlike all right, you're out.\" So then they go to my wife, and say \"You gotta divorce your husband or you're gonna get kicked out,\" and she goes, \"No.\" - That's a hell of a statement from her. - It's gonna get harder from here, so I'm not quite sure how to. Okay, so I'll try to,\nI'll try to do my best. - You don't seem like a man\nwho's afraid of hard things. - Okay, so she's like, \"No.\" So then they go to her\nparents and they say, \"You've gotta disconnect\nfrom your daughter and your three granddaughters, or you're gonna get kicked out,\" but they have three other\nkids who are Scientologists, who have spouses who are Scientologists, who have grandkids. So I feel like, up until that point, everybody was sort of making\na decision for themselves and what would be best for themselves, until they get to her parents, and then they're like, \"Which grandkids are we gonna lose?\" Okay? At the part where they were trying to get me to disconnect from my mom, there were hours that I\nspent talking to them going, \"You know, guys, there's another way.\" - [Lex] You know. - \"It doesn't have to go this way. There's another way that\nends well for all of us,\" and that wasn't even considered. And I go like, \"They created this monster, and that's a fact,\" and\nthat's why I take joy in it. When people ask me, \"Is Scientology a destructive cult?\" I don't even have to get into\nall the academic discussions of what's a religion and what's a cult and what's the difference, I go, \"As long as they\ndestroy families like that, they're a cult.\" - So they cut people off\ndeliberately one by one, and it doesn't have to be that way. - [Aaron] Right. - And why is it that way? - I mean, it started with L. Ron Hubbard laying out a policy\nframework, a policy structure, that if interpreted and applied\nin the worst possible way with the worst possible judgment\ncan be abused in that way. I would make the argument that if an Annie Broker had taken over, that Scientology policy does have enough little caveats baked into it, that even the policies about disconnection could be interpreted and implemented in a non-destructive way. There is room for judgment and discretion, and Miscavige has just created the worst possible version of Scientology, and that's where you sort\nof get that argument of \"Does he even want\nScientology to succeed?\" 'cause he seems to be hell bent on making sure that he doesn't. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I don't want to\nsee him make it succeed, but it does bring that\nquestion up of like, \"What are his motivations? Can he not see that he's destroying the thing he's supposed to be expanding?\" - That's also, you know,\nthere's ways to measure cost and that would probably\nbe the most costly aspect of Scientology is the suffering associated with the separating of families. - [Aaron] Yeah. - I mean that actually just puts, makes a very concrete,\nwhat we value in human life is the connection to our loved ones, like everything else doesn't matter. Like getting $50 a week, like that, like getting\nmoney stolen from you, getting the truth stolen from\nyou, none of that compares. You can even frame that as the good, as it could be a lot of\npositives, whatever, in the tribe, but separating families,\nseparating loved ones, that's the destructive thing So no hate though? - No, I genuinely don't hate them. - Do you forgive them? - 100%. There's no one I look at\nin Scientology that I go, \"How dare you.\" If I was in their shoes, having to, you know, operate\nunder David Miscavige's orders, I would've done the same\nthing and I would've loved it. Truthfully, I don't blame any of them. I mean, I take the opposite approach. If they knew what I knew,\nthey'd be doing what I'm doing. - [Lex] Yeah. - If they knew what I\nknew and believed it, they'd be doing what I'm doing. They're not dumb. It's not dumb people in Scientology. - They're ambitious, they're dreamers, they got hope, they're driven,\nall that kind of stuff. - Yeah. And it's one of the reasons I like putting up content on my channel, so they can see, \"Hey,\" like if you are a Scientologist, you look at that and you go, \"Hey, he seems like he's doing well. He's kind of, he's happy He's a positive guy. He's a good communicator. He knows what he's talking about. He's not lying. He's not exaggerating.\" I don't exaggerate anything on my channel. I don't make up anything, and this actually comes\nfrom an experience I had. From 1998 to 2000, I was living in L.A. I sort of had a two year period in my life where I actually had almost\nno contact with Scientology, and during that time, I found\nmy way onto the internet, and there was a website, it might have been ESMB,\nEx-Scientology Message Board but whatever it was, it was, at that time, the main source of critical information about Scientology on the internet. And I looked at it, and remember, I was still a true believer, and I looked at this\nand it was so offensive, insulting, hyperbolic, exaggerated. I was like, \"Oh, just\na bunch of bullshit,\" I was in Scientology for 16 more years. If what I had seen on the internet about, critical of Scientology, if what I had seen when I had seen it was something that\nactually resonated with me that I was like, \"Oh,\" that I believed was true,\nthat seemed credible, I would've gotten outta\nScientology 16 years earlier. So I was like, \"How can I help create an\nexperience on the internet that if a Scientologist stumbles upon it, it will resonate with them\ninstead of repelling them?\" And that is exactly what\nI have set out to do and what I believe I've accomplished. - There's the content, the message, but also just showing\nthat you can be happy outside of Scientology. - Exactly. - [Lex] You can have a fulfilling life. You can be a good man. - Yeah. - All of that."

      "text": "What benefit do you think Tom\nCruise gets from Scientology? So why is he still in Scientology? - He genuinely loves it. And also Miscavige does, there's one celebrity who does have the most unique experience in Scientology, and that is Tom. Scientology hires all of Tom's staff. There are no, all of Tom's staff are subject to interrogations\nby Scientology, not only in the hiring process, but during the employment, like David Miscavige and\nScientology runs Tom Cruise's life and his production company\nand his household staff. - Do you imagine there's some\npersonal connection there where there's just, they\nlike each other a lot? - Best friends. I mean, it's them against the world. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Is how they see it. I think it's pretty easy\nto see how that works between the two of them. - I think this idea of\nthem against the world, us against the world, is a really power, powerful, intimate, like, I kind of see like friendships and relationships that way,\nthat, not in a dark sense, but it's like the world is\nfull of cruelty and absurdity and unfairness and so on, and it's nice to huddle\ntogether like the penguins in \"March of the Penguins\" against the cold.\n(Aaron laughing) - [Aaron] 100%.\n- And they're just like, and so especially with the\nideology of Scientology, it, this idea that you can be anything. You can essentially, I mean, you can manifest it essentially\nthrough like believing it and you don't really\nput it into those words, but believing that you're a God is a really like, inspiring,\npositive thing to think. - If they could figure\nout how to do all that without destroying families\nand bankrupting its members, they might actually have a future. That's why, like, it's funny, 'cause sometimes I feel like\nit's like I'm rooting for them to like succeed and do it right. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And I'm not, but it's an interesting\nacademic discussion to have of like, we can all see how much\npeople will sacrifice in the names of belief and religion. - [Lex] Yeah. - We can see how much\nScientologists sacrifice based on what they already believe. If he would just start\ntreating people less horribly. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You know what I'm saying? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It might actually have a future, not that I want it to. - It seems like this dark\nlesson of human nature that they, that like\nthere's something about, you know, to use the word \"cults,\" that you just stop seeing\nreality for what it is because there's a lot of things that could make this a better organization that's actually helping people flourish and be a little bit more\nlike loose about membership. - [Aaron] Right.\n- Not dividing families, not causing suffering, not\ncausing financial harm, but actually inspiring\npeople and helping people, but then it maybe, it\nfundamentally changes what the organization is, and maybe that means\nsomebody like David Miscavige loses power, too, which\nmight be very difficult, or people that are close to him lose power and people hold onto power, so. - [Aaron] Yeah. - Whatever the human force is here, it seems to become worse\nand worse over time. What about, oh, lemme ask\na conspiracy question. Is there a chance that Tom\nCruise is being blackmailed? That there's information from auditing? - No?\n- [Aaron] No. So that kind of stuff is\nnot, that's very conspirator. - I've actually come out\nand said definitively I do not know of a single\nperson who stays in Scientology because they're afraid\nof being blackmailed. It's just not a thing. It's just not a thing. Does Scientology have enough information to blackmail someone if they want it to? Well, sure. I mean, and it doesn't\neven have to be true. It could just be lies. Who cares, who knows? Scientology can say\nwhatever the hell they want. So that's the thing, it\ndoesn't even have to be true. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And actually, that would be the argument\nagainst blackmailing. Like in order for Scientology to blackmail you with that information, they'd actually have to represent that, \"Yes, he really did tell us this.\" And it's like, \"Well then why are you\nspilling secrets of members?\" right, like it sets a bad precedent."

      "text": "- What are some of the sins\naccording to Scientology? - Most of the sins, from\na Scientology perspective, are just doing or saying anything that brings disrepute to\nScientology itself, right? Remember they don't, it's not like Christianity\nwhere there's rules, \"If you break this rule, you're\nnot getting into heaven.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - Because Scientology doesn't\nthink about things that way. - Oh, there's the drugs. You can't do drugs, right? - You can't do drugs and you can't take any\npsychotropic medications. - And no medications almost at all? - You're allowed to take medications. It's just, there's no rules\nexpressly prohibiting it, it's just most Scientologists tend not to. You can take Advil, but\nmany Scientologists won't. - [Lex] Okay. Yeah. - You just can't take anything\nprescribed by a psychiatrist, a psychologist, or any drugs\nthat are psychotropic drugs. I mean, SSRIs are considered probably the closest thing to pure evil\nin the world of Scientology. - What about, weird\nquestion, what about sex? Is there boundaries on what's? - There used to not be, it's become very puritanical\nin the last many decades for a reason I can't actually explain. Like Miscavige does seem to be infatuated with controlling sex. - [Lex] Hmm. - Like that that is one\nthing about Miscavige's version of Scientology\nthat's gotten very strange. I mean, L. Ron Hubbard even\nspecifically wrote a policy that says \"We are no longer\ngoing to regulate in any way the bedroom activities of people.\" He literally said \"From this point on, no one is allowed to be\nsubject to any justice actions of any kind whatsoever\nfor anything they do in their sexual lives,\" but that was still, it did not give permission\nfor gay relationships. That was still referring\nto straight stuff. - And monogamous only? Can you do promis-, like can you do open marriages\nand open relationships? - According to that L.Ron\nHubbard policy, you can. - Yeah, but you know. - I think he wrote that policy before he created the Sea Organization, and then what happened is, this is actually how\nthis came into effect. He created the Sea Organization. You had a lot of people on a ship and everybody was just banging each other and it created just a nightmare\nof personal relationship, that, it was, it was making\nproduction impossible, not 'cause everybody was\nspending so much time banging, but because everybody was so upset about who was banging who. - Yeah, yeah.\n(Aaron laughing) - I mean there, sex and sex\nand that kind of dynamic is really, I mean humans\ndo what humans do, and then there's drama and all that, and it understandable, 'cause\neverybody's so intimate, it's a closed tribe. It makes sense to limit\nsex, otherwise everyone's, but otherwise it becomes a sex cult. - [Aaron] Yeah. - Which a lot of them end up becoming. Well on that topic, would you classify Scientology as a cult? - 100%. But not because I'm like fully conversed with the academic differentiations between \"What's a religion and what's a cult?\" I mean, Scientology would say, \"Well all small new religions are cults,\" and I don't know, that's probably true, and some people would say\n\"All religions are cults,\" and I'd be like, \"Depends\non how you define religion, and it depends on how you define cults,\" but I just fall back on my thing of like, \"If you are destroying families,\" - [Lex] Yeah. - \"And bankrupting your\nmembers, you are a cult.\" That's how I look at it. - It's us versus them, and the \"them\" could be your family, it could be your loved ones. That's deeply destructive, and one of the things you would probably throw into a definition of a cult is something that's actually destructive. 'Cause like I do a lot of\nstuff that's occult-like, like jiu-jitsu, like there's a lot of\nreally close-knit tribes, but there's no negative toxicity to it. There's no divide. There's no divisions. Or if there is, it's more, boy, try being a fan of\na certain soccer team and then becoming a fan\nof another soccer team. - [Aaron] That's hardcore\n- And like. (both laughing) - But I'll tell you, I train jiu-jitsu as well, and I have found that community of people to be one of the most loving and helpful group of people ever. Shout out to John Keller\nat Gracie Baja Clearwater. - [Lex] Nice. - No, but seriously, like it's one of, it's one of the reasons\nI continue to do it, despite my back, my hip, my shoulder, it's like, it's just such\na cool group of guys. - The list goes on.\n(Aaron laughing) - You used to not, I think it was much more\ndivisive in the beginning from his Brazilian roots. One of the things that's really hard is that the team-oriented, like if you're this team, you're ride or die with this team, and there's no (indistinct) they go to another team. - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- And I think that aspect, that was actually a turnoff\nfor me in the beginning, the toxicity of that, because I understand that a\nlittle bit for the elites, for the highest of the highest. - [Aaron] Right.\n- But there is, I like the brotherhood and\nthe loyalty of the people, like the Olympic gold medalists, the, like the best in the world. - Yes. - [Lex] But for like recreational fun. - I know. - Like, it's like, this is all ultimately about the camaraderie of\nall human beings together, not some whatever label\nyou put on yourself."

      "text": "I don't think we actually talked about the organization itself. We talked about tax exempt status, which is really important. We talked about some of the control, like through the propaganda, control of what's out there. It's actually interesting that you said that like Scientology has pretty much lost the battle with the\ninternet at this point. - [Aaron] Oh yeah, yeah. - Which is kind of inspiring, that it's hard to defeat the internet, but then there's like bots there. I think, if you're sophisticated,\nI'm not sure that's true, but if you're not sophisticated. - It's kind of remarkable they haven't been able to\ncapitalize on these bot armies, 'cause there's one thing that they have, it's a lot of tax-free money that they got nothing\nelse better to do with it. - [Lex] Yeah, like they can invest. - You know, they just, they\nshould give you a call, like they just don't have\nthe right people apparently. - But, that said, how\ndo they wield influence with government agencies, with, you've talked about the local police - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- enforcement, also federal agencies, anything? - That is the one way they effectively put their money to use is\nlobbyists and attorneys. You know, judges, very rarely\nhave they ever been able just to get a politician on their side. It's the behind the scenes people. You know, Greta Van\nSustron's a very high-level, long-term Scientologist, and her husband, I always get it wrong, it's either Jim Cole or John\nCole, I always get it wrong, he's a very powerful\nattorney who has a lot, wields a lot of influence\nbehind the scenes, and that's just one example, like the reason why that's\nan interesting example is 'cause he's actually a Scientologist and he travels in those circles. Scientology though, its\nmoney goes to good use by hiring non-Scientologists, retired judges, attorneys, lobbyists. It really is how they\nget almost anything done. Like Miscavige himself is not\nhobnobbing and glad handin' and shaking hands and meeting these folks, it's the non-Scientologist professionals who work behind the scenes\non Scientology's behalf. - Can you describe the dynamics of that? How that actually happens? Like why would the, why would the police department work on behalf of Scientology? - I meant more the courts\nand court regulators, not the police department, but, well, for example, it can\ncome down to something as simple as this. In Clearwater, Scientology\nhires Clearwater Police to do off-duty work for them. They pay like three times\ntheir normal off-duty rate. So they will, even though\nI'm not aware of anyone on the Clearwater PD who's\nactually a Scientologist, they basically end up with, they would call them\nallies or safe points. - [Lex] Got it. - Right, people who like will literally operate as Scientology spies. You know, if someone comes\nin and files a report about some child sex case, someone in the Clearwater\nPD is calling Sarah Heller at the Office of Special\nAffairs at the Flan Gladden base to let her know, \"Hey, heads\nup, we got a thing coming in,\" and then Scientology can run around and go talk to all the Scientologists who have knowledge about this and either get ''em outta\nClearwater, you know? - So it's not like direct,\nexplicit corruption, but more just friends and coworkers? - [Aaron] Yeah. - Integrated deeply in the community? - Yeah, I call it soft corruption. So an another example, you have the mayor of\nClearwater, Frank Hibbard, well he used to, when he\nwon his recent election, he stepped down from\nsome of his nonprofits that he served on, but the nonprofits that he served on also gets millions of dollars of donations from some of Scientology's richest Clearwater members, right? You have one of the mayor's\nbest friends, Joe Burdette, literally a paid lobbyist for Scientology. So, that creates a chilling effect on anyone who's gonna be\ntalking smack about Scientology, because his friends are\non their damn payroll. So I call it soft corruption. It's not illegal, it's not illegal, but it's how Scientology wields influence, and what's ironic is that\na lot of these people who work on Scientology's behalf actually secretly hate Scientology. - They kinda see through it,\nbut it's part of the community. - [Aaron] Yeah. - It's deeply integrated in the community, and there's financial leverage. Are you ever afraid, I mean,\nafraid for your well-being, afraid for your ability\nto function in society because of the pressures from Scientology? - [Aaron] No. - Is that because you're\ngenetically malfunctioning or mentally, or is there, speaking out is a kind of protection? - I think it's one of those things that once you've seen behind the curtain and you see the Wizard of\nOz is just a silly man, you just don't have any fear. Now, it's one of these\nthings like people say, \"Oh, you're so brave,\" and I go, \"Eh,\" what's that quote? \"Bravery is, you know, being\na soldier and being afraid and going in any way.\" It's not brave to run in if you don't think nothing's\ngonna happen to you. Like, so I'm just trying to, like, I do not hold myself up as an example of bravery, because - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It's not like, \"Oh they could destroy\nme, but I don't care.\" No, there's not a damn\nthing they can do to me, and it's one of, that's one of the reasons I continue to put out content every day, to just basically go, \"Hey,\nstill here, I dare you to try to do something\nabout it, but you can't,\" and hope that that also\nserves as kind of an example for other people to go,\n\"If this schmo can do it\" - [Lex] Yeah. - \"and they can't do anything else to him, then maybe I can do it, too.\" Because I would love it. I would love there for be a 20 channels where former Scientologists\ntalk about their experience. - I mean, that is bravery\nbecause what happens is fear seeps in even if\nit's not grounded in reality, but at the same time, like, you know, my grandfather who fought in World War II, I mean the story is, I mean he was very convinced and sure, most of the people he\nfought alongside with died, he was a machine gunner, but he believed that bullets\ncan't hit him, right? - [Aaron] That's what he said? - Well, you know, he was\nright. (Lex laughing) Right, because he survived, so there's some sense like you're. - [Aaron] Survivor bias. - That he's like, just like you are, was like, \"I'm not brave, I\njust, the bullets can't hit me.\" (Lex laughing) I mean there's a dark\nkind of truth to that. There's some, you know, it's like, it's a feedback loop where\nif you have the confidence and you push on forward and\nyou're brave in that way to not let fear seep in and affect you, it actually gives you less\nthings to be scared about, and. - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- I mean, but that initial few steps\nmight be, for people, it might be a very difficult stuff to take to talk about publicly. - The fear was knowing how the\nfamily was gonna be destroyed and trying to prevent that. I was terrified of that happening, but it happened. There's nothing left to be afraid of. And that's kind of the thing,\nlike they created this beast, and the same is true for Mark Headley, the same is true for Mike Rinder, I said they've essentially created a Scientology-proof virus,\nScientology resistant strain, by throwing everything they have at us. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- For so many years. They have just, through natural selection, created people who just do not give a damn about anything they could or would do, and maybe there is something\na little wrong with me, 'cause when I get a\nphone call from someone, like, \"I just got this\nphone call about you\" and it's clear that at Scientology PIs doing work behind the\nscenes, I get really excited. I get really excited. I don't get nervous. I'm not gonna be like,\n\"Oh no, what's happening?\" I'm like, \"Oh yeah, this\nis gonna be exciting!\" I'm like, \"Okay!\"\n- [Lex] That's great. - Because everything they try to do to me, I'm gonna figure out how\nto reflect it back on them and make them look ridiculous. - And that pales in comparison to the separating from family. - [Aaron] Exactly. - What, is there parts of\nyour family that you've lost because of Scientology? - Just, yeah. If you, most of my episode on the Leah Remini\" and the Aftermath Show\" was talking about me and my twin brother. It's just a pretty horrible story. It's just a pretty horrible story. So I do have a younger brother\nwho's still in Scientology and disconnected from me, but I never had much of a relationship with that brother really,\nto begin with, right? But my twin brother died\nwhen I was like 23 or 24, and that was, without any question, a direct result of our\nScientology experience. You know, he died in a car accident that wasn't technically\nhis fault or anything, like, he wasn't even the one driving, but the fact, the specific\nfact of his death was not, meaning like the fact and the\nmanner of his death and time wasn't like specifically\nbecause of Scientology, but our story and how, where\nour relationship got to and how he was even in a position of having something\nlike that happen to him, is directly attributable to Scientology. - Do you think about him? Miss him? Is part of what you're\ndoing in memory of him? - Yeah, for sure. - [Lex] Man, this is such a. - I mean, you know, we\nwere identical twins. Can you imagine two of me? (Lex laughing) - I can barely handle the one! (Aaron laughing) - [Lex] I love it. - Ugh. - Losing him, would that\nbe the darkest moment in this whole journey\nof Scientology for you? - Two moments would\nequal the darkest moment. It would be that, and\nalso just the period of, you know, six, nine, 12\nmonths of impending doom, knowing that my wife's whole family was gonna be obliterated, and that there's nothing\nwe could do about it, and kind of telling ourselves\nevery step of the way, it wasn't really gonna happen. You know? And I really felt like you ever watched \"The Ozarks?\" I felt like Marty Bird. Now, this was happening\nbefore \"The Ozarks,\" but when I watch \"The Ozarks\"\nand I see that character, the entire world is\ncrumbling down around him and all he can, all I did like, \"All right, what's the next step?\" I watch Marty Bird and I go, \"That's my fucking spirit animal,\" because you can only control\nwhat you can control, and you can't keep Scientology\nfrom destroying your family, and literally, like I, it's funny, I mentioned this show a\nlot, because I watched that and I go like, \"That's\nexactly how I felt,\" you know? I talk about this six\nmonths or nine, 12 months, whatever it was, of impending doom, it's not like I was an emotional\nwreck during that time. You know, in private I was, but it's not like I was just freaking out. It was like, \"The sun's\ngonna come up tomorrow. The world's gonna keep spinning. I can't control it. This is hard. I can't believe this is happening, but tomorrow's a new day.\" I've never personally,\neven at the darkest times, I've never experienced anything that I would characterize as depression, certainly not ever any\nsuicidal thoughts or anything. Even in the darkest of times, and, again this one thing I go, \"Is it because of Scientology\nor is it just me?\" There really is an emotional detachment. There almost has to be. - And it's a cold calculation. \"What are my options? What do I do here?\"\n- Yeah. And then once I figure out\nthe answer to that question, I'm actually quite chipper and happy. You know, like that's sort of my default like you could give me\nsix horrible options, once I figure out the best of those six, I'm gonna feel like \"I just\nhad a pretty good day.\" - That's brilliant, 'cause I just, watching\n\"Ozarks,\" it was so stressful. - [Lex] It is, right?\n- So stressful watching it, and he usually finds a way, and usually it is a set\nof really bad options and it is one of the bad options, what's the best of the bad options? - And he almost gets pissed\noff at everyone around him for being so pouty about it. - [Lex] Yeah. (Aaron laughing) - Oh no, I'll never watch that show again, the same way again. Oh that's beautiful.\n- But you know, it's like, you know, it's still simmering there\nright under the surface, like pretty damn close to the surface. Do you know what I mean? - Yeah. Yeah. - And people sometimes ask\nabout recovery and whatnot and like, what does that look\nlike and what does that mean, and this sort of goes back to kind of the emotional detachment, is I go, \"What the fuck\ndoes recovery even mean?\" I mean, if you're an alcoholic\nand you're recovering, you know what that means. \"I used to drink. I don't drink now.\" Well I used to be an a cult\nand I'm not an a cult now. How else am I supposed to feel about this for someone to be like, \"It\nseems like you've recovered.\" What the fuck does that even mean? Like I'm sure some academic\nhas an answer to that question. I'm not someone who partic-, I don't spend any time\nthinking about that. My recovery is success and a little bit of trolling and revenge. - [Lex] Yeah. - But mostly success. You know, what does it mean to be a recovered former cult member? What, you don't cry when people\nask you about your brother? I don't know what it means. - [Lex] Yeah. - I've never had therapy, but not because I'm still like\nagainst it from Scientology, I just like, I'm not gonna\npay to talk to someone. Do you know where else I could do that? Scientology.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Now I know there's a\nlot of people going like, \"Oh boy, he.\" I know there's a lot. I'm not shitting on therapy. I would rather have a beer with my friend and talk about this shit.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Than talk to a professional\nfor $200 an hour. - That is a kind of therapy, yeah. - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- Yeah, listen, That's part of the\nreason I do this podcast. It's talking to people\nthat you care about, that you're close with, it's a really powerful, powerful thing. But yeah, I don't know\nwhat a recovery looks like. And success to you is defined,\njust be \"Find happiness.\" Find happiness outside the closed bubble that defines what happiness\nlooks like, of Scientology. - If I can make my kids\nhappy, that's success to me. - What advice would you give\nto your kids on how to live? - [Aaron] Travel the world. - A life they can be proud of? Travel the world? - Travel the world. Get rid of friends who don't push you up and don't celebrate your success. It's hard to give that\nadvice to young children, 'cause kids are always so catty, but honestly it's like, when I see, that really is, I just think,\nnot just advice to my kids, but some of the best advice to anybody. - [Lex] Yeah. - If you've got anyone around you who doesn't celebrate your success, just spend less time with those people. - [Lex] Yeah. - Surround yourself with people who actually wanna celebrate your success and push you to succeed. I think that's true, I think it's even more\nimportant at a young age, 'cause if, at a young age, you get used to being\naround people who kind of take joy in tearing you down, then that's what you become accustomed to. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You know? And I just think, you know, having friends who love\nyou and support you is just about the closest thing\nto the true meaning of life. - And who believe in you, who believe in your potential, and some of those ideas underlie the good parts of Scientology. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And except there's a lot\nof dark parts of Scientology that separate you from the\npeople that believe in you and that love you. Well, this was a beautiful conversation. You're a beautiful human being who came full of gifts, and I mean, I, genuinely, first of all, you're an inspiring human being, but most importantly, I can't wait until I can purchase\na bobblehead on the store. (Aaron laughing) - So I can keep that\ninspiration on my desk top. Aaron, thank you so\nmuch for talking today. Thank you for being you, for being brave. I know you said you're not, but thank you for being\nbrave for talking about this. You're an inspiration and\nyou help a lot of people. Thank you, brother. - Thanks for having me. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Aaron Smith-Levin. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, I'm gonna leave\nyou with some words from Ralph Waldo Emerson. \"Be not the slave of your own past. Plunge into the sublime seas. Dive deep and swim far, so you will come back\nwith new self-respect, with new power, and with\nan advanced experience that will explain and overlook the old.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."

  "full_text": "- If Scientology was just\ngetting auditing when you wanted about the subjects you wanted and you could take it or\nleave it, that would be fine. It's the fact that it's part and parcel to this entire organization\nand this entire experience that has, as a part of that experience, taking everything from you, demanding everything from you, controlling who you can speak with, controlling who you can\nhave relationships with, who you have to erase from your life. This is where, and it's hard to, it's hard to place one pinpoint on \"This is where Scientology goes wrong.\" It's really hard to do that, because the good parts of Scientology and the bad parts of Scientology are all just Scientology. - The following is a conversation\nwith Aaron Smith-Levin, a former Scientologist\nraised in Scientology, and have worked in the\norganization full-time for many years as a staff\nmember and a Sea Org member, including the job of training\nScientology auditors. Today, he educates the\npublic about Scientology on his YouTube channel called\n\"Growing Up in Scientology.\" This is The Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Aaron Smith-Levin. Well, let's do a full\noverview of Scientology, it's ideas, how it operates, how it wields its power and influence, and let's start at the very basics. What is Scientology? - Scientology is a belief\nsystem created by L. Ron Hubbard that does fundamentally\nbelieve that we are all immortal spiritual beings, called thetans, that we have native, God-like potential, that there is nothing more\npowerful in the universe than a thetan, like, so God-like is, you know, quite literal here, and that, through various\ndecisions thetans have made, they have fallen away from\ntheir native God-like power to, fallen down to a state where most thetans aren't even aware that they are thetans, aren't even aware that\nthey ever have lived before or have these powers, and that\nthetans are now in a state where they're trapped in\nbodies, trapped here on earth, trapped in this prison\nof a physical universe, trapped on this prison of a planet, and that only Scientology\ncan restore a thetan to its native state. - Are these multiple beings,\nlike is there one thetan inside of me that's\ntrapped in this prison? - Well, the thetan would be you. - The thing would be me. - The thetan is you. - But I'm presumably limited\nin some fundamental way. So this thetan that is me is limited. So there's like 8 billion\nthetans on the planet? - There's one primary\nthetan animating each body. Later in Scientology, you\nlearn there's actually like tens of thousands\nor hundreds of thousands of like sick, unconscious,\nhalf-dead thetans stuck to you that are now an additional\ncause of problems for you. - [Lex] Sure. - But fundamentally, at the lower levels, the non-confidential levels, there's just one thetan per body. - Well, I mean, it's an interesting idea. I just would like to kind of\nexplore the philosophy of that. So there's a being that's all\npowerful, that's immortal, and its projection, its\nmanifestation on this earth is fundamentally limited,\nand you're trying to, the process of Scientology is the process of letting go of those limitations. You know, that's an interesting idea. I mean, a lot of religions\nhave this kind of idea that there's, not just religions, but like we have the capacity\nas human beings to do, to achieve greatness in all kinds of ways. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And that's the question we have with our cognitive abilities. We start with a embryo and\nbuild up and into this organism and like this world of\nopportunities before us, what are we capable of? And the idea that we're\ncapable of almost anything is a really powerful one, and there's a lot of religions, there's a lot of philosophies,\nthere's a lot of advice, self-help that kind of\nexplore those ideas, and so it seems like with Scientology, this, the application of\nthis religious philosophy means that we're limited, and we'll have to break the\nthrough those limitations, and there's a process to break\nthrough those limitations. - That would be correct. So what can make it\nchallenging to adequately and completely describe\nScientology in the beginning is what Scientologists\nbelieve actually changes as they progress further into\nor further up in Scientology. So the explanation as I've given it, is pretty consistent\nwith what you would get at the lowest levels. - Got it.\n- Right. You're a thetan, I'm a thetan, everyone's a thetan, and we have a reactive mind. L. Ron Hubbard would say the reactive mind is a collection of these recordings, mental recordings of any moments\nof pain and unconsciousness you've ever had in your life. It's like the subconscious mind. It is always recording in moments of pain and unconsciousness and\nthat these are called, these recordings are called, L. Ron Hubbard called them \"engrams.\" Now, when L. Ron Hubbard first\nwrote \"Dianetics\" in 1950, this was before Scientology came along a couple years later, right? So in 1950, when he wrote \"Dianetics,\" it wasn't a spiritual endeavor. It was supposed to be a mental health, a science of mental health. So, as of that time, the\nearliest engram you could have was the incident of birth. Being born was an engram, and technically, in \"Dianetics\", he said you could have prenatal engrams, like when you're still in the womb, but there was no concept of past lives as of 1950 version of \"Dianetics,\" right? And so, the idea there was\nthat the reactive mind is essentially a stimulus response mechanism created through evolution\nmillions of years ago to protect the individual from\nthings that would harm them. In other words, things that would bring about\npain and unconsciousness. So you have these recordings\nof things that hurt you, created pain and unconsciousness, and in present time, these\nthings will react upon you in a way to cause you\nto avoid similar things reacting upon you in a\nsubconscious, unconscious way. - So the reactive mind\nprotects you from the trauma that is inside your subconscious mind? - Yes, and the idea is\nwe've now, as human beings, evolved to a state where it no longer serves us beneficially, it\nonly serves us negatively. This was Hubbard's theory, and he said, so you can get rid of\nthese engrams by, you know, basically recalling\nthem and going over them again and again using\nDianetics auditing therapy, and if you get back to the moment of birth and erase the earliest engram, all the other subsequent engrams\non the chain would vanish. - Oh, nice. So there's a chain? - Earlier, similar, earlier, similar, earlier, similar, earlier similar. Okay. So that gives you a\npretty good understanding of how L. Ron Hubbard thought of the mind, because that carries on, has applicability later on in Scientology. - I mean, that's a pretty\npowerful model of the mind. I mean, Freud had similar conceptions that a lot of our traumas are grounded in, sort of poor formulation of sexuality or imperfect formulation of sexuality in early childhood or something like this, and then we're trying\nto figure out the puzzle of whatever we formed in early childhood. - [Aaron] Right. - I mean it's similar, similar kind of. - It is similar. That's probably what Hubbard took it from. In the early days of Dianetics, before he decided psychiatry was evil. - [Lex] Yeah. - He actually credited Sigmund Freud with some of the shoulders\nhe was standing on. - Sure. - [Aaron] In writing \"Dianetics.\" - So he still admired\npsychiatry at that time? So that's an interesting\nmoment of Dianetics. So what else? You mentioned Dianetics,\nauditing was there, too. So if we just, before Scientology, what are the ideas that formed\nwhat we know as Dianetics? - As I've just described\n'em, that is the fundamental. - [Lex] That is. - That is pretty much the\nnuts and bolts of Dianetics. - Was it applied? Was it applied often? - Oh, yeah, no, it's what\nDianetics in the early days was all about was just auditing. Auditing is the process of\nthe one-on-one counseling. Recall a moment of pain\nand unconsciousness, run through the engram over\nand over and over again, find something earlier, similar. That is Dianetics auditing. One of the main things that\nchanged with Scientology is that birth or prenatal engrams were no longer the earliest\nengrams on the chain. - [Lex] Yeah. - The idea is you have to\nget the earliest engram on the chain for the later\nones to blow, which is a race. And so, but all of a sudden,\nnow, with the addition of an immortal spiritual\nbeing into the equation, well now, the earliest incident could be trillions of years ago in\nother galaxies and universes. - Other universes, so before the appointment of this universe? - Oh yeah, yes. - Is there a model of physics\nintegrated in any of this? - [Aaron] No.\n- Okay. - The model is you have\nthe physical universe, and then above that you\nhave the theta universe. So we used the word thetan earlier. So in Scientology, I'll\nuse the word theta. I dunno, theta's just\nbasically thetan power, thetans collectively. So, Hubbard would say you\nhave the theta universe, which is senior to the physical universe and creates the physical universe. And remember, I said, I said\nnative, God-like potentials, so we're not talking about\nthe God who created the earth. We're just, like Scientologists\ndon't believe in a God, but we'll get into that later. We're talking about\njust creating universes, like just think like matrix, like just. - [Lex] Yeah. - When I say creating a universe, essentially just creating\ndifferent thetan simulations. - But it sounds like a little bit more like the ideas of Plato, which is there's these platonic forms, there's abstract forms that are bigger, more general than our\nparticular reality here, and those forms are used\nto construct the reality. - [Aaron] Well, I grew up in a cult, so I'm not familiar\nwith the works of Plato. (Aaron laughing) - [Lex] You can't use that\nas an excuse for everything. (Aaron continues laughing) - I would like to, you know, non-jokingly - [Aaron] Yeah. - Steelman the case, because\na lot of philosophies, a lot of religions, a lot of\neven scientific endeavors, are a little bit full of uncertainty. You can call it bullshit,\nbut you're on unsturdy ground because we're surrounded by mystery, and you have to take these\nideas somewhat seriously and see where those ideas go wrong. This happens with communism, this happens with capitalism, these ideas sound beautiful\nin their ideal forms, and then they somehow go wrong, and some go more wrong than others. And so I don't think sort of, it's easy to sort of caricature\nand make fun of the ideas. I think if you take them seriously, you'll start to understand like, when you're in it, it was serious. It can be very convincing. It's, you know, the devil is going to\nbe a charismatic person, he's not going to be a caricature\nof a ridiculous person, so that helps us understand which ideas will sound appealing, but\nwill become dangerous. - I totally agree. In fact, it's one of the\nthrusts I have on my channel is wanting to talk about\nScientology in a way that would actually resonate\nwith current Scientologists. - [Lex] Yeah. - Not just resonate with\nformer Scientologists. I want people who are\nstill in to be able to hear how I talk about it and go,\n\"Wow, he's being really fair.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - \"And really accurate. He's not just a hater,\"\nyou know what I mean? - If you look at the, you know, let's take, one of the worst\nplaces on Earth is North Korea. You have Kim Jong-un, and the reality is there's a\nlot of citizens of that nation that deeply love the leader, because they've grew up in that way, and you, I mean, through fear, through all kinds of manipulation, through propaganda and so on, they're not allowed to love\nmembers of their own family. They're not allowed to have romantic love. They're only allowed to\nhave love for the leader. And to reach those people, you have to empathize with the fact that, in their eyes, in some\nsense, this is a great man. This is a God, a Messianic figure. You can't just make fun\nof the ridiculousness of the situation that this\npudgy person waltzing around creating propaganda, like how's this the? (Aaron laughing) - [Aaron] With a funny haircut. - With a funny haircut. Like, it's so easy, Hitler too, to make fun of, to make a caricature of the person, but this is a real person, a real person that influenced the minds of millions of people, in the case of Hitler, you know, tens of millions of people, and created a huge amount of suffering, not because of the caricature version, but because he was a charismatic leader. He was somebody that people\ndeeply, deeply loved, and that just, over time, I mean, with the abuse of any kind of ideology, this happens over and over. And so, yeah, it's interesting\nbecause Scientology is so close to the core\nof what is America, because so many Americans\nare involved with it, so it's interesting to study\nthe beauty and the power of the ideas that underlie\nit and where things go wrong. - Yeah. And I'll just say it's\ninteresting to note, you would never get a representative of the Church of Scientology to sit down and have a conversation with you and even be as fair and\naccurate about Scientology as I'm going to be, which is noteworthy. - Do you honestly deeply\nbelieve that's the case? There's not going to be\na high-level official that would sit down for a conversation? - No. - I disagree with you. - [Aaron] I hope you're right. - Because I think that, given the current dynamics\nof what's happening, I think in order to save, from their perspective, in order to save the the\nChurch of Scientology, they have to be transparent and authentic. Basically steelman their case, but better. - You would think so. - Well, we'll talk about the other ways you could do that, which\nis through manipulation, through propaganda,\nthrough controlled media, and all that kind of stuff. - They paint themselves into\na corner of not being able to send a representative\nout into the world to speak honestly about it, because you're literally not allowed to. So when faced, you know, if you're just sitting down with an entertainment journalist, a representative might be able to fudge their way through an interview, but sitting down for a\nlong-form format interview with someone who is gonna ask them about Xenu and the body thetans and Leah Remini and Lisa McPherson, that's a no-go zone. So I'm representing why\nit will never happen, but shit, I would tune\nin for that interview. I mean, I hope you do get someone. - You don't think David Miscavige will sit down for an interview? - I would love to be wrong. - You know, in general, journalists, in these\nkinds of situations can be, can attack in a way that doesn't empathize and doesn't come from a\nplace of deep knowledge and understanding, and\nI think it's possible to have serious conversations\nwith people like that in an empathetic way, but it's\nalso in a challenging way. I think there's a huge\namount of trust required, and obviously, for a very\nsecretive organization, the amount of trust, yes,\nmight be too much required. - Yes. Anyone over there, if\nthey've done their homework, knows you're gonna be as fair as anyone in the world's going to be, and yet, there's simply things they're not allowed to talk about, and they're not even allowed to say, \"I'm not allowed to talk about it.\" - So that's a fundamental part\nof the Church of Scientology is the secrecy? - [Aaron] Yeah. - So that's where you're\ntrained as you go up through the ranks, is \"Secrecy, secrecy.\" - It's not even a matter of training, it's that there's an entire,\nthe entire upper half of Scientology's Bridge\nis simply confidential. I mean, and I never even did those levels when I was in Scientology. I didn't learn what\nScientologists actually believe on those upper levels until\nafter I got outta Scientology, and I was freaking born and raised in it. - Let's go there, let's\ngo to your personal story. So you spent 30 years in Scientology? - Yeah, I was four years\nold when my mom got in. - And then about seven years ago got out. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And you're on what YouTube channel now, and you're an educator? - So I was four years old when my mom got introduced to Scientology. - [Lex] Yeah. - And she got in really\nfast, really quick. So, but I was 12 years old\nwhen I was taken out of school and started officially full-time\nworking for Scientology. Okay, so, in various\ncapacities I worked for them from the ages of 12 to the age of 26. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Okay. So, and then I was 34 when I officially parted\nways with Scientology, which was really more them\nofficially parting ways with me, but we can get into all that later. That's just kinda how Scientology does it. - And what do you do now\nin terms of Scientology? So now I run \"Growing Up in Scientology,\" the YouTube channel, but\nwhat I primarily do is I help run an organization\nthat helps people who are escaping from Scientology. I'm the Vice President of\n\"The Aftermath Foundation\" and we created the foundation\nafter the television show, \"Leah Remini\" Scientology\nand the Aftermath,\" and there was such an\noutpouring of support from non-Scientologists\nall over the world, \"What can we do to help\npeople leave Scientology?\" that we decided to create a foundation, and it's been incredibly successful. We've helped people\nescape from all regions and echelons of Scientology. We've accomplished, what we've\naccomplished is far beyond what we actually envisioned\nwould be possible. It's been a huge success. - So we'll talk about the negative aspect, the abuses of power, but let's just explore the\nideas a little bit more. So the public facing\nthree fundamental truths of Scientology, maybe\ncorrect me if I'm wrong, man is an immortal spiritual being, like we said with thetans, his experience extends well\nbeyond a single lifetime, so infinite memory backwards. His capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized. The capabilities are unlimited, are? - Yeah, God, So that when I say God-like, I really just mean, you\nknow, Thanos, like unlimited. Scientologists don't believe in a God, so when I say God-like, I just mean the most powerful entity, the creator, the prime mover unmoved, except we are all that. You know, a thetan in definition, in Scientology, a thetan has\nno position in space or time. A thetan does not actually\nexist in the physical universe. It might choose to locate\nitself in the physical universe, right, and then forget\nthat it made that decision and then sort of get caught and trapped in the physical universe, but that, once the thetan is\nrestored to its native powers, everything you see here\nin the physical universe is just a thetan playing a game. Like literally, we are in a simulation right now of some thetan. So like physics doesn't have to make sense when we're talking about it this way. Like technically you're\na thetan, I'm a thetan, we're here, but it could, this could also all just\nbe another thetan's game. - So thetans all the way down. - Yeah. It's just thetans everywhere. Thetans, it all comes down to the thetan. - Is there an idea of a God? 'Cause I read there's a kind of, there is a sense of a supreme being. Is that basically the\nthetan that's at the core, at the bottom of it all? - [Aaron] Yes. - Not per, not defined, undefined. - Correct. Scientology has this\nconcept of the dynamics. L. Ron Hubbard breaks life\ninto a different dynamics and the, a dynamic meaning\na thrust towards survival. So he would say, you know, the first dynamic is you yourself. Second dynamic is your family. Third dynamic is any other\ngroup that you're a part of other than your family. Fourth dynamic is all humankind. The fifth dynamic is\nplant and animal life, all non-human life. Sixth dynamic is the physical world. Seventh dynamic is sort of like\nspirituality, collectively, thetans, us as thetans. And the eighth dynamic,\nL. Ron Hubbard says Scientology doesn't deal\nwith the eighth dynamic, but we recognize that\npeople have this idea of a supreme being, and so, Scientology says you\ncan call the eighth dynamic, \"The Supreme Being dynamic,\"\nbut we call it \"infinity,\" just the allness of everything\nwithout having to define it. And then they sort of do a little dance and they're like, \"Scientology, the purpose of Scientology\nis to get you to the point where you have your own\nunderstandings or realizations about the nature of the eighth dynamic. We don't tell you what you\nhave to believe about that\". And technically speaking, that is true. Technically speaking, that is true. There's no point in Scientology\nwhere they sit you down and say \"You're now required to revoke your belief in a supreme being,\" It's just that everything in Scientology is inconsistent with a\nbelief in a supreme being. You can still find Scientologists who, through cognitive dissonance, will tell you they believe\nin a supreme being. Mostly, they're lying to you. - How is this inconsistent\nwith a supreme being, because like thetans? - [Aaron] Because thetans have\ncreated everything, not God. - Okay, so thetans created everything. Did they, they're also a creative force, they're not just the force\nthat runs everything. - [Aaron] Right. - But can't those be just\nthe fingertips of a God? - Sure. The only way you could\nreconcile a supreme being is if you say a single supreme\nbeing created all theta. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like the spiritual big bang. - [Lex] Yep. - But that's not what most\npeople think when they say, when they talk about God. They're talking about a creator of. - The physical universe. - [Aaron] Yes.\n- But there's no theta. - Right. I mean, even as I've\ndescribed Scientology so far, none of what I've said is something I even subject to ridicule. This is pretty common\nsense stuff actually. I mean, if you believe in\nspirituality or spirits at all, there's nothing I've\ndescribed so far that's crazy. - [Lex] Yeah. - You know, believing in past lives isn't particularly unique or special. - [Lex] Right. - The fact that Scientology\ndoes this little dance of pretending to believe in a God. I mean, it's even like a PR line. Scientology representatives will tell you, \"You can be a Christian\nand be a Scientologist.\" Well, lemme tell you what, Christians don't believe in past lives and lives on other galaxies\nand planets and universes. They, but, and Scientology knows that. Scientology knows you can't be a Christian and be a Scientologist,\nbut they will say that. It's just an example of sort of the fundamental baked-in dishonesty. - Because it's so\nimportant to Scientology, on the organization level,\nto have tax exempt status, I wonder, how do you,\ndo you know the process of what it takes to prove that an organization is a religion? - While going through\nthat process with the IRS, for the second time, by the way, Scientology actually had tax\nexemption in the early days and the IRS pulled it and\nthen they got it back in 1993. While going through that process again, the IRS actually took issue with the fact that Scientology was claiming you could be a Scientologist and a member of another religion. The IRS actually said,\n\"Pump the brakes there.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - \"If you're gonna say that, we're gonna say you're not a religion.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And they actually put\nin writing to the IRS, \"No, no, no, no, no. That's not what we meant! That's not what we meant! We meant in the beginning you can be both, but eventually, you just\nhave to be a Scientologist.\" - So you mentioned the eight dynamics, but you also mentioned survival, so that seems to be a core principle, that human existence is about survival. Can you elaborate what\nis meant by survival? Are we talking about the\nsurvival of the human species? Survival of the individual humans? Survival of the manifestation\nof thetans in human form? What do we, what's survival? - So it would be all of that, because survival is the dominant force across all the dynamics that, I mean, L. Ron Hubbard, it was either Dianetics\nor science of survival. He says he \"Discovered the principle upon which all life exists,\" and that is all life, no\nmatter what it is trying to do, are you ready, Lex?\n- [Lex] Mm-hmm. - It's trying to survive. - That's pretty powerful. That's pretty powerful. (Aaron laughing) - See, here's the thing.\n- Is it? - Here's no, I gotta tell you, I gotta. - You might get me back in, Lex. - No, I'm not, I'm not\ntrying to get you back in. I'm trying to take you,\nget you to take seriously, the power of the ideas behind Scientology, because I think those\nideas are not bad ideas. They resonate with a lot of\nideas throughout philosophy, throughout religions, throughout the history\nof human civilization. The interesting aspect\nis how it goes wrong. - But here's the thing,\nLex, here's the thing. It is consistent with\nprior efforts or studies. It's just that L. Ron Hubbard said this was a watershed breakthrough that it was being discovered\nfor the first time. That's kind of what I'm mocking really - Yeah, but you can mock\nNietzsche for saying \"Man is will to power.\" You can mock Freud. - [Aaron] But did he claim to be the first person to ever say it? - Well, Nietzsche had a bit of an ego, so. (Aaron laughing) - Like, and he's full of contradictions, but I'm pretty sure, the implied thing is that\nhe was the first to say it. - [Aaron] Yeah. - There's a lot of scientists, there's a, one of the people I really\nadmire is Stephen Wolfram, who wrote a book called\n\"A New Kind of Science\" that explores complex\nsystems and cellular automata and these mathematical systems that have been explored before, but he boldly kind of defined, \"I am presenting to you a whole new way to look at the world\" and if you just set a little bit of the ego behind that aside, there's actually beautiful ideas in there. They have, of course, been done\nbefore and explored before, but sometimes, people declare\n- Sure. - [Lex] \"This is the coolest.\" - That's the only thing\nI'm really mocking is - [Lex] Yes. - He said this discovery that\nlife is trying to survive is greater than the discovery of fire. Okay, I mean, it gets a\nlittle silly, but that's fine. We can agree that the fact\nthat life is trying to survive has meaning and is meaningful\nand can be, is valuable, and it's true, I mean,\nlife is trying to survive. - Also, there's a non-trivial definition of \"What is life?\" here,\nso this idea of a thetan, the thing that permeates through lifetimes - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- Through people, there's some fabric that is bigger than individual biological bags of meat. That's a, philosophically,\nan interesting idea. Of course, if it's not grounded in a little bit more physical reality, then it becomes a little too woo-woo. And the way L. Ron Hubbard and\nScientology define survival is very much intertwined\nwith how they define ethics. Ethics, anything, you know,\nto be ethical is pro-survival, to be unethical is counter-survival, but we were talking about just\nthe concept of the dynamics, like what does survival refer to? And it actually does refer to all of them, but just keep in mind, when it\ncomes to the seventh dynamic, thetans collectively,\ninvolved in here is the idea that a thetan cannot die. There's no such thing as killing a thetan. A thetan can only, can only survive. And so, anyway, this\nconcept of the dynamics is one of the most fundamental\nand important concepts in Scientology, but,\nbecause I mentioned that, it also gets tied up with\nethics, and this probably speaks to what you were just talking about, is you can have the ideas and the concepts and you can have \"How do they go wrong?\" because they hold that Scientology, applying Scientology, getting\npeople into Scientology, is the key to basically saving every spiritual being in existence. When you're analyzing what is ethical, it becomes whatever's good\nfor Scientology becomes, by definition, ethical, because anything that's\ngood for Scientology, which is a third dynamic, is inherently good for all the dynamics, so that's where you get the\nends justifying the means to do anything possible,\nuse any means necessary, to forward the aims of Scientology. - That's kind of where a\nlot of Soviet implementation of communism went wrong, is\nthe ends justify the means, the equality, the justice for the workers, if we have to kill,\nmurder, imprison, censor - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- In in the name of that, then it's for the greater\ngood in the long term to achieve the ideal of communism. - In some respect, Scientology\ncreated a near-perfect communist experiment in\nits Sea Organization. What is it, \"From everyone\naccording to their ability to each according to their\nneed\" or something like that? Scientology's Sea\nOrganization is a damn near a perfect communist experiment, coming from someone who\ndoesn't necessarily know what the perfect communist\nexperiment really is, 'cause I'm not, I grew up in a cult, Lex. - You can't keep using that as an excuse. - [Aaron] It's a funny\ntagline I use in my videos. - I like it. - But like, it is interesting\nthat an organization that is so hyper-capitalist\nand so money hungry and is known to be very wealthy, at its' core is run by this\ngroup of Sea Org members that live a communist lifestyle. - We're gonna jump around. - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- Let's go. What is Sea Org? What is Sea Organization? What is this organization? - The Sea Organization is\nthe most dedicated version, the most dedicated\nbrand of Scientologists. So there's three like\nechelons of Scientologists. There's public, who just live\nnormal lives in the real world and they pay to do Scientology\ncourses in auditing. Then there's staff members who\nalso live in the real world but work on two and a half year contracts or five-year contracts at their local Scientology organization, and then once they finish their contract, their debt is paid or whatever. And then there's the Sea Org members. These are the guys who signed\nthe billion-year contracts. They don't have lives\nin the outside world. They don't own property. They live in Scientology-provided housing. They eat in Scientology-run cafeterias. - Is there an actual contract\nthat says a billion years? - It's symbolic, but yes. - [Lex] Okay. - Like no, it's not a\nlegally enforceable contract. (Aaron laughing) They haven't succeeded in enforcing it in any subsequent lifetimes yet. - Marriage contracts should\nbe like that, a billion years, 'cause then we, not\n\"'til death do us part,\" but a billion years. It really makes it very concrete of what you're signing up for. - Yeah. Those are the billion-year guys. You hear a lot about \"The\nbillion-year contract, the billion-year contract.\" That's the Sea Org, and all\nof Scientology management, international management,\nmiddle management, continental management,\nand even some lower level service orgs are composed\n100% of Sea Org members. You're not allowed to\nmarry or date someone who's not in the Sea Org. You're also not allowed to have children. - With anybody outside of\nSea Org, or in general, you're not allowed to have children? - Sea Org members are not\nallowed to have children unless they leave the Sea Org. You're expected to have an\nabortion and stay in the Sea Org, 'cause it's the greatest\ngood for Scientology, if you accidentally get pregnant. - Interesting, 'cause it distracts from the focus of the work? - [Aaron] Yeah. - What about sexual relations? - Only once married, but that's why people get\nmarried after like three days. You're like, \"Hey you, you\nlook, you look all right. Let's get married.\" - Are you allowed to have divorce? - Yeah, you get divorced\na lot in the Sea Org. I've known people who\nget married and divorced three times by like, by the age of 25. - [Lex] Oh wow, okay. - Because, in the Sea Org, getting married is\npractically like dating. - [Lex] Right. - Also, unless you're married, you're living in dorms with\na bunch of other people, so in order to get your own room, you also have to get married. So there's many benefits. - Oh wow, okay. So you mentioned communism, in which way, is there a hierarchy inside Sea Org? Is there a redistribution of influence, position, money, power in the Sea Org? - Everyone in the Sea\nOrg makes $50 a week. - [Lex] Everybody? - Except David Miscavige, but, right, and some posts might have a\ncash bonus incentive structure, but fundamentally,\ntheir pay is $50 a week, so even the head of a big\nScientology organization is getting 50 bucks a week. - Are celebrities also part\nof Sea Org or no, not usually? So this is really the management layer. So what's the idea behind $50 a week? Is that basically live a humble life? - They don't have to\ngive you anything at all, It's just cons- oh, you mean like what's\nthe idea behind not paying? - Yeah, basically not paying. - Everything you need is\nalready being provided for you. You're not here for the money. You're working all the time anyway, it's not like, you don't have days off. I mean, you're working all the time. There's not, it's, there's\nno concept of the weekends. There's no, \"Oh, thank God it's Friday.\" Friday's just another day. - And how are the positions,\nthe tasks, the jobs allocated within the Sea Org? - [Aaron] What do you mean? - Like what kind of tasks you're doing, what kind of stuff you're doing? - It's very similar to\njust any other business as far as you're gonna\nhave your human resources, you're gonna have your sales, you're gonna have your accounting, your operations, your quality control, it's just that, in\nScientology, your operations is delivering courses in auditing, so. - [Lex] Got it. - Your operations and your quality control are where most of the activity occurs as far as delivering Scientology, and then you've got your, you'd call it business development, but that's just bringing\nin new members, right? So the function of a\nScientologist organization is very, very comparable\nto a normal business in the normal world. - So let's talk about the\nproducts of this business, auditing and courses. So what's auditing? - So auditing is, so we described earlier, Dianetics auditing. Scientology auditing is\nvery similar to that. - So at first glance, it\nlooks like psychotherapy, a kind of therapy? - All Scientology auditing\nis going to look like that. It's one-on-one talk therapy. You're in a room by yourselves,\nno distraction, no noise. - One-on-one.\n- [Aaron] Yeah. - So like this? - Yeah, but, and in Scientology, they have what's called an E-meter. - [Lex] Right. - Almost all auditing employs\nthe use of an E-meter. - What's an E-meter? - So an E-meter is a\ndevice that just measures the resistance to a small electrical flow, except Scientologists\nbelieve that this E-meter can be used to simply direct the progress of an auditing session, to determine whether\nthe auditing has reached a good satisfactory, conclusion. All auditing sessions have to end on a satisfactory conclusion, like that's the job of the auditor. There's, you don't just, it's not like, \"Sorry the session sucked,\nsee you next week!\" It's not like that. Every auditing session has\nto end on a positive note, and if it doesn't, there's\ncorrections to be made. So the E-meter. - What does it look like visually? Like? - Oh, you can pull it up. Pull up \"Mark VIII. E-meter Mark VIII.\" - So there's a few dials. - [Aaron] Yep. - There's basic information\nabout time and duration, I'm presuming, then a dial that\njust goes zero to something. - Okay, so let's say that\nthe meter's in front of me and you're the one holding the cans. - I'm holding the cans, so you're doing the auditing of me? - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- Okay, okay. I'm holding the cans. - No, literally in the beginning\nof an auditing session, when you're calibrating the\nsensitivity of the E-meter, you do a can squeeze. So I go \"Squeeze the cans please.\" - Okay, so I'm just\nlike squeezing the cans. - Yeah, and I'm just\nchanging the sensitivity, 'cause when you squeeze the cans, I want to get about a\none third of a dial drop on the needle. The idea is you don't want, if the needle's too sensitive, then every time you shift\naround in your chair, the needle's gonna bounce\nall over the place, so you're trying to set the\nsensitivity to this thing and that's all. The knob there on the bottom to the left, that's the sensitivity knob, and that determines just how much, how sensitive the needle's gonna be, and the bigger dial is\ncalled the tone arm, and that is changing, I\nwanna say voltage or current, but I'm not intending, I'm gonna get, one of those\nwords is wrong, right? - But it is a real device.\n- [Aaron] It's a real device - That you can actually\ncalibrate to probably, you know, get an outcome that you want? - Yeah. So here's even how, just how a Scientology\nauditor believes it works. You're holding the cans, there's a tiny little\nbattery in that E-meter that's sending and el-, you're completing the circuit\nwhen you pick up the cans, right, so you got a\nlittle thing going there, and that needle will respond\nto your physical movement, but that's not what we want. We want you to sit the hell still so that we can read this thing when I'm asking you questions. Okay. - So you're sitting\nthere still, very still. - As still as you can.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Comfortable, right? And I'm gonna go, \"Is there something you're\nwithholding from me?\" and what I'm looking for is, right when I say at the end of \"me,\" I'm looking for the needle\nto dip to the right. - Having a needle, even\nif it's kind of random, can really be like a\ncatalyst for a conversation. - That's what it's used for. except it's an enforced conversation, so I'll give you a really\ngood example of this. So you're holding the cans, say, \"Is there anything\nyou're withholding from me?\" and I get an instant read and I go, \"Is there anything you're\nwithholding from me?\" You're gonna go, \"I don't think so.\" - And I don't see the needle. - No, you don't see the needle. Okay. I go, \"Well, what did you think of when I asked you the question?\" Now, if you've already\nhad a lot of auditing, you know how this goes. It means I got an instant read and we're not going to move on until this question gets resolved, okay? So you're gonna go, \"I don't know what I was thinking of\" and then I'm gonna,\nI'll be like, you know, \"Take a look and I'll help you out here.\" I'll try to steer you. Okay. So I'm looking to get\nroughly the same read while you're thinking about whatever. \"I mean, what was that? What was that right there?\" - And you can start digging to what? You can start. - I just want an answer\nto the question, okay? - And I can go to memory. - Yeah, and you can give\nme any answer you want. There's no way for me to\nknow if you're giving me the right answer, but I want\nyou to give me something. - [Lex] Yeah. - If you say you can't give me anything, I'm gonna keep using the E-meter until you give me something. - [Lex] Yeah. - Okay, so let's say\nyou give me something. I'm gonna get all the details about that, and until like time,\nplace, form, and event, I wanna know everything that happened. I want to know all the details. And by the way, I'm writing all this down, so I'm taking notes of\neverything you're telling me that it's a bad thing that you did that you haven't told me about. Okay, so I'm keeping notes. When you represent to\nme that you've told me everything there is to tell, I'm looking for the needle to give like a smooth back and forth motion like this, and Scientology calls\nthat a floating needle. That means, in Scientology\nland, we're done with that. So now, I might go back\nto check the question. \"Okay, good. I'll check\nthe question again. Is there anything you're\nwithholding from me?\" Ooh, if I got another read, we gotta go through the process again. Okay. If you tell me \"I've told you everything\" and I don't get a floating\nneedle, I've gotta go, \"Okay, is there an earlier, similar thing? Have you basically done\nan earlier, similar thing? Is they're an earlier, similar time you haven't told someone something? Or is there an earlier\nsimilar thing that you did to the thing that you just told me?\" We're gonna keep going earlier, similar, earlier, similar, earlier, similar until I get a floating\nneedle, and that's where, I'm explaining it this\nway so you can see how no matter what the\nspecific auditing session happens to be about, there's still the potential\nin any auditing session that you're going into past lives. - [Lex] Yeah. - Just because you have\nto go earlier, similar until you get a floating needle. Okay, now here's how Scientologists think the E-meter actually works, meaning why does the E-meter work? So we talked before about\nthese mental pictures, right, these recordings? - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - Okay, well we spoke about engrams, just recordings of pain\nand unconsciousness. Well, Scientology would hold the bad recordings aren't the\nonly recordings that you have, those are just the recordings\nin your reactive mind. You also have an analytical mind, which is just your conscious memory, conscious recording of\neverything from present time to the last 76 trillion years. - [Lex] Yep. - And Hubbard would\nsay that these memories are actually a perfectly\ndetailed recording, I think he says like 56\nperceptions or something, and that it's perfect and you\ncan access that information, you just have trouble doing so. Okay, so he says that these recordings, these mental pictures, have actual electrical charge in mass. Now you asked before, is there\nany actual physics in this? I don't know. Where are you supposed\nto store the pictures of your last 76 trillion years\nthat have charge in mass? I don't see it, but\nHubbard says it's there. Okay. So he says that these things have mass and when you recall them\nor put attention on them, you create an electrical flow, which maybe through\nmagnetic fields or whatever impinges upon the electrical\nflow of the E-meter and it shows up as a read on the needle. That's how Scientologists believe that's why the needle reads. Now cynics would say the needle only reads on palm sweat and movement. Well, I know that's not true. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - Right, I can't tell you everything the needle does read on, but\nI can tell you it's not just moving your hands and sweaty hands. - It does correlate to thoughts probably. - Some way, some how. - 'Cause if it didn't\ncorrelate to thoughts, this process would be way too inefficient, because you, it would be too, there's going to be a bunch\nof people who are just not - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- You're not gonna get the, what is it called? The floating needle. Like no matter what. - I can't explain to you how\nyou get a floating needle, but it sure as hell isn't hand sweat and it sure as hell\nisn't squeezing the cans. - Right, so you, eventually most people will get to the floating\nneedle and somehow. - [Aaron] You get floating needles. - There's like a feed, there probably is a feedback mechanism that each person realizes how their mind and body\n- [Aaron] Yeah. - Because you want a resolution, right? - It's probably - [Lex] You want your needle\nto float, for both people. - Yes. - And it's probably a great\nexperience when you're like, \"Yes!\" it's a gamified feeling, right? - Well when you're training\non how to use the E-meter, there are drills where you practice, generating with your mind,\nvarious needle reactions. So, you know, there is a\ndrill where you sit there and you consciously try to\ncreate a floating needle by recalling happy thoughts. - [Lex] Yeah. - \"Go to your happy place.\" And at the end of every auditing session, you actually have to go to a third party, sit down in front of an E- meter, and verify that your needle's floating. - [Lex] Nice. - Every single auditing\nsession not only has to end on a floating needle, but then you have to go to someone else and have the floating needle verified. Any Scientologist who's a\nseasoned recipient of auditing knows how to make their\nneedle float at the examiner. (Aaron laughing) - Well I gotta be honest though, this process, again, sorry\nto be sort of going there, but it feels like this is a very rigorous talk therapy session. Is there good aspects to this? - Sure. A lot of people find\nauditing very helpful. I mean, I've heard some describe it as quite thoroughly addictive. Me personally, I never\nenjoyed getting auditing. That's probably more a function\nof having been raised in it and it was never something I wanted to do, it was something that was forced\non me as a child, you know? And also I was never, I don't like talking about\nprivate secret stuff. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like you kind of have to\nwant to be an open book. - [Lex] Sure. - To honestly and thoroughly participate in an auditing session. - 'Cause there's not necessarily a belief that this is gonna be private. - There's no expectation of privacy, but there's no expectation\nthat your stuff's gonna be leaked for\nblackmail either, I mean. - [Lex] You kind of. - You trust the people\nin the organization. - Even despite rumors and stuff like that? But the rumors are coming from people that are lying to you, essentially. - If you're a Scientologist\nand you're participating in an auditing session, you know that anyone\nin the organization is, has the ability to know\nthe stuff that you talk. It's not like, \"Oh my God,\nI'm only telling my auditor 'cause I think no one's ever gonna know.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - You know that people know.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - But you also trust the organization. - How quickly does it go to past memories? - For people who are seasoned, like they actually like going past-life. - [Lex] Yeah. - I hated it. I would make sure, I was really good at\nmaking my needle float. I didn't want to have some auditor, 'cause I never believed\nin the past-life memories. - [Lex] Yeah. - So I didn't wanna be in that impassable, you know, reach an impasse\nin an auditing session where I was being asked for\nsomething I couldn't provide, 'cause I knew this auditing session has to end on a good point. - [Lex] Yeah. - But Scientologists enjoy,\nfor the most part going, they call it whole track, whole track is past-life, going whole track. Your time track, they\ncall it the time track, is your whole memory, but whole track refers\nto anything past-life. - [Lex] Okay. - So going whole track or deep whole track with high reality. Meaning it's not like, \"Oh, I have a fuzzy memory and\nI'm not sure if it's real.\" Like your real seasoned\nScientologists are like, \"Oh yeah, I was on this planet\" - [Lex] Oh\n- \"at this time circling, and this is what I was\neating for breakfast.\" - Fascinating. Before the origin of\nlife on earth or before? So billions of years\nago, on a distant planet, what you were eating for breakfast. - [Aaron] Or other universes. - I wonder if there's a\nnice shortcut to sneak up to actual trauma that happened\nto you as a therapy device. I just, so putting Scientology aside, I just, I'm thinking about,\nas a technique for therapy, discussing, basically, you\nknow, some people have trauma, and one of the things you do with therapy is like bring the trauma to the surface, that's the stuff that\nhappened to your childhood. Maybe it's a more convenient thing to do to kind of map that\nindirectly onto a fictitious telling of what happened to you, something like that trauma,\non a distant planet elsewhere. It could be a nice way to sneak up to it. - Yeah. And it goes both flows there, not just things that have happened to you, but things that you've done. - [Lex] Yeah. - So, you know, you\ncould be being asked for, you know, you'd be going back to, \"I wiped out a civilization.\" - [Lex] Oh wow.\n- \"I committed genocide on, this race on this planet.\" - [Lex] Oh wow. - Oh, yeah. - So you can actually\ntake on a whole new guilt? - [Aaron] Oh, yeah. - So I, okay, all right, you might actually take on a\nlot more guilt than let go of, because if you feel like\nself-critical aspect of the brain, boy, 'cause I'm, my brain\nis really self-critical, so I could see myself manufacturing, if I was forced over time, some kind of story where I did genocide a whole population of\nlike Pluto or something at a distant, somewhere in Alpha Centauri. - [Aaron] Yeah, so I mean. - And now I walk around with that guilt. \"Wait, I'm actually a horrible person.\" - So imagine though, if you had, not only are you looking at, you know, if someone's being self-critical, trying to identify destructive\npatterns of behavior in your present life, but\nwhat if you really internalize the fact that \"I haven't only\nbeen this way for 40 years.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - \"I've been this way\nfor 40 trillion years.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - But Scientology would\nargue that, as a thetan, you're inherently good. All thetans are basically good, so the goal of the\nauditing procedure there would be essentially to figure out, find the moment, find what\nit was that caused you to make that shift as a being, to dramatize, you know, evil\nintentions and stuff like that. So even if you're going whole track looking at all the\nhorrible things you'd done, the goal is to find like, \"Well, what happened just prior to that? What was like the prior confusion and what did you misunderstand\njust before that?\" and whatnot. So the goal is basically,\nso Scientologists, after a lot of auditing, are also convinced that\nthey have fixed the reason for any non-optimum conduct. - And underlying this is a belief that, at the core, we're all good? - [Aaron] Yes. - There's a lot of really\npowerful ideas in Scientology. - [Aaron] That's true.\n- Which is so interesting that it goes wrong. - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- Okay. What about the training? You mentioned the training of the auditor. That's really interesting.\n- [Aaron] Yeah. So what's, how lengthy is that process? - It can take years. - I mean, one of that\nquestions I wanna ask is, are people in Sea Org, like as an auditor, do you believe everything? How much, is there a crisis\nof faith that creeps in? In religion, you have a crisis of faith when you start to wonder\nlike, \"Does God even exist?\" So in this case, how often\ndo you start to doubt that some of the core beliefs\nof Scientology are false? - Scientology would say that Scientology is not about beliefs,\nit's about application of the techniques of Scientology auditing to improve someone's spiritual\nawareness and ability. So the belief level of Scientology is pretty much the stuff\nwe've already discussed. - The effectiveness of\nthe auditing process? - So the effectiveness\nof the auditing process, this is one of the things Hubbard says, is that standard tech, standard, Scientology, they call it the tech, the technology of how to deliver auditing, standard tech, works 100% of the time when applied 100% correctly. Well that's kind of unfalsifiable, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - Because anytime it doesn't work. - It wasn't applied correctly. - Exactly. That's a nice little escape hatch to pull on having a crisis of faith. \"Well, it didn't work!\" \"Well, then obviously, it\nwasn't applied correctly.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - That's where quality control comes in. Their job is to nitpick, and you can always find one thing that wasn't done correctly. - Communism didn't work because it wasn't implemented correctly. It's the, it's always, it's always, it's always an escape\nhatch with ideologies. - [Aaron] That's right.\n- For sure. - That's right. I would probably argue that auditors are not in a position of\nhaving many crises of faith, 'cause actually, they're\nusually seeing people, for the most part, improve in some ways through the process of auditing. Now, auditing can create like a state, somewhat of a euphoric state. You feel great, you're\njust blown outta your head, you know, you feel, you're\non top of the world. I've had that in some of my auditing. - As an auditor, sorry? - [Aaron] No, as the\nperson receiving auditing. - Okay. - And so, my point is, as an auditor doing a lot of auditing, you know, you're gonna have\nsomeone in front of called, the pre-clear is the\nperson in front of you who's getting the auditing,\ncalled the PC or the pre-clear. They see, over and over and over again, these PCs having these\nsort of euphoric states and floating needles, and \"I\nfeel great and fantastic.\" \"Oh thanks, you saved my\nlife\" and da da da da da. Like, I've always said, if people didn't find Scientology helpful, nobody would ever stay in Scientology. - Right. - Right. And so, auditors are pretty much the ones doing the heavy lifting\nof what it even means to be a Scientologist. Those guys aren't the ones that you end up having crises of faith. I mean, doing Scientology auditing, it doesn't require that you believe, just have faith that\nyou believe something, you just have to go through these motions, and Scientologists, one of\nthe reasons Scientologists think this is all scientific\nis 'cause it's like, \"I don't care if you\nbelieve why this works, I care how you feel at the\nend of an auditing session.\" - And empirically speaking,\nlike anecdotal data is, it actually seems to\nimprove people's lives within the context, so taking the outside world out of it, within this particular organization, you're actually measurably\nseeing improvement? - [Aaron] Yes. - Is that, to some degree, real, because like if you look at\na book like \"Animal Farm\" where the pigs start to\nrule the other animals, and over time, the life of the animals gets worse and worse and worse\nwhile the pigs keep saying that it's actually getting\nbetter and better and better. Again, communism, same thing. The rationing is getting\nworse and worse and worse, less and less food, but\nthere's constant reporting that there's more and more food. We're winning! Hashtag. - I would argue that what\nyou've just described, it could be an identical\ndescription of what it feels like and what it means to go up Scientology's Bridge to Total Freedom. You are reinforcing to yourself that everything's getting\nbetter and better and better, and you'd be like, you don't spend time\nwith your family anymore. - Yeah. - You're broke, even though\nyou make a lot of money. You're always stressed. You're at the beck and\ncall of these people who seem to run your lives, like how a Scientologist\nfeels about their own life is, it's very interesting to compare that to how that person's life looks to their non-Scientology family members. - Mm-hmm. - I get contacted by a lot of people who've never been in Scientology, but they're like \"I got a\nfamily member who's really deep and I just, can you help\nme understand some things? Why is this person's life like this? Why is this person's life like this?\" So I don't wanna say that\nScientologists do not actually, I don't wanna say, \"Oh,\nit's all in their heads. They think they're being\nhelped, but they're really not.\" That doesn't feel honest, you know? But it's this thing where, if Scientology was just getting\nauditing when you wanted about the subjects you wanted and you could take it or\nleave it, that would be fine. It's the fact that it's part and parcel to this entire organization\nand this entire experience that has, as a part of that experience, taking everything from you, demanding everything from you, controlling who you can speak with, controlling who you can\nhave relationships with, who you have to erase from your life. This is where, and it's hard to, it's hard to place one pinpoint on \"This is where Scientology goes wrong.\" It's really hard to do that because the good parts of Scientology and the bad parts of Scientology\nare all just Scientology. - Yeah, so there's definition\nof what's bad for you, and it's probably, in the\nbeginning, is bad for you. This almost just sounds like a template of a toxic relationship. You know, there's a bunch\nof stuff in this world that is just not good for you, so the authoritarian says like, \"I'm just protecting\nyou by blocking you off from those negative things,\" and they're probably, they\nare probably negative things, but then this like, this\nfreedom starts closing in to where you can't no longer speak freely, think freely, act freely, and then there's some, I\nmean that's why sort of power corrupts and absolute\npower corrupts absolutely. That person doing the controlling actually starts getting that like dopamine rush of the\ncontroller, that's exciting, and it's a vicious negative cycle. So you start out as a, it starts out good 'cause you're trying to\ndo good for the person, but then it somehow goes to shit. - [Aaron] Yeah. - So what are the aspects that just, that are often controlled, about a person who's in\nScientology, especially Sea Org? - Well, information control,\naccess to the internet, access to any information\ncritical of Scientology. - Is some internet access allowed? - Public Scientologist has no restrictions to their access to the internet, they're just not allowed to read anything critical of Scientology. - Oh, okay. So they're self, they're\nsupposed to self-control what they read or not, and\nwhat's the explanation? Is it always assumed that anything critical of Scientology is a lie? - Mm-hmm. They've really pushed this thing that unless you've been in a\nScientology organization yourself, or unless you've actually\nbeen a Scientologist, you couldn't possibly know\nthe truth about Scientology. If you're only getting information from people who aren't\nmembers or former members, then you couldn't possibly be getting the correct information. Now, they don't realize the\nmath there doesn't make sense. If you can find out the true information by becoming and being a Scientologist, then that means you can\nget the correct information from a former Scientologist, because they traveled that path and they got the correct information. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- So they still create this, they try to create this\nunfalsifiable loop, where unless you are personally doing it, you don't have correct information, and you go, \"Well, what about the people\nwho did personally do it, got the correct information, left, and are now sharing\nthat with others?\" \"Well, no, those are lies.\" \"Well, okay, so just anything\nyou don't like is a lie then?\" And you go \"Yeah, pretty much. That's kind of how it,\nthat's kinda how it works.\" - So what about the control\nof negative information on the internet? What, like the actual operations? I've, you know, preparing, I should admit, I don't know\ntoo much about Scientology, and I was doing a bunch of reading and the Wikipedia page on\nScientology, interestingly enough, is not that negative about Scientology. So like, it made me ask, you know, you have to\nbe a little bit careful how you consume stuff from Wikipedia. You have to consider, because\nmoney can buy things there, there's certain special\ninterests and so on, but like, it made me wonder, like with a lot of controversial topics, what is true and where do I look? Where do I go for truth? So like, how much sort\nof deliberate action is there to control what is true on the internet by Scientology? - Well, these days, they've pretty much, I think, thrown in the towel, but - [Lex] They have. - Scientology middle management\nwas editing Wikipedia so often from IP addresses that were traced back to\nthe Scientology buildings, that Wikipedia locked them\nout from any IP addresses associated with Scientology\nfrom being able to edit it. It's like Scientology was so infatuated with trying to control the information, and in the early days of the internet, they had a certain degree\nof success with that. They just, it's just hopeless these days. - It's the scale, the scale is not there, but actually, I'm very\nsurprised how bot farms, how effective that can\nbe at a very small scale. - [Aaron] Mm.\n- If you just pay a hundred people, just spread narratives, but the bad stuff, the reason that's effective\nis you can kind of create conspiracy\ntheories that create chaos and nobody knows what is true, that, bot farms can do, but actually really nicely\ncontrol a narrative is hard. So to create chaos, it's easier to do. To basically say like, you know, do PR control is very hard. Yeah, so especially, on the internet, especially\nwhen the critical eye is there, the internet can smell bullshit, which is one of the really,\nreally powerful things about the internet. - And I gotta tell you, it's one of the reasons\nI do my YouTube channel. It's one of the reasons I\ndecided to upload every day. I've uploaded every day\nfor the last six months. I just wanted there to be a\nnon-stop flow of information of any kind in any variety, as long as it's fair and balanced,\nintelligent, interesting, that Scientologists who\nstumble upon the internet will go, \"Oh, look, someone's\ntalking about my thing. Let's see what they got going on\" and \"Oh, I know this guy.\" The fact that Scientology\ncrushes so much information, before, before YouTube, before, like, I have the only like\nbig Scientology channel, and that only got big\nin the last six months. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - Okay, so before that, there were channels, there was things, but it's almost like it took a lot of, like people felt like it had took a lot of bravery and courage to like, say something on the\ninternet about Scientology, and so people would pop up and there weren't very many voices, and I was like, \"I want\nthis to be prolific.\" I want to be prolific. I want to have 30 or 40\nother channels being prolific so that Scientology couldn't possibly successfully control\nthe narrative about it. - Have you been personally attacked? - AaronSmithLevin.com is a website created by the Church of Scientology. Have you seen it? - No. What kind of content is on there? - Oh, \"Aaron's an abusive father and a horrible husband and the worst staff member we've ever had\" And, oh, I openly talk about it, because I think the fact that Scientology even does things like\nthat is fucking hilarious. - [Lex] Yeah. - And anything they try to do to me, I'm, the way I think about it is, you know you're just\ngiving me an opportunity to turn the mirror back on you and show everyone how horrible you are. - Does it stick? - [Aaron] No. - So you find that there is ineffective. - It's completely ineffective. They are so over the top, and well, I'll tell you how the website even came into being. So I was on the first season of \"Leah Remini: Scientology\nand the Aftermath.\" Every single person who\nparticipated in that show got a website. (Aaron laughing) It's just that everyone\nelse's website is like, WhoisMarkHeadley.com, WhoisMikeRinder.com. Well, I bought, WhoisAaronSmithLevin.com, but I was too stupid to buy Aaron, I didn't buy AaronSmithLevin.com, so I'm actually the only one who has a website in their name. - Oh, nice. - [Aaron] Yeah, and I'm like.\n- Dot com. - I can probably get a\nlawyer to get it back for me, but I'm like, \"Why?\" I want everyone to see\nwhat a nasty, petty, disgusting organization that this is, and nobody believes anything\nScientology says, anyway. - Does the general public know that it comes from Scientology? - Pull it up. It says right on the bottom, \"Copyright 2000, whatever, Church of Scientology International.\" Like they didn't even try to hide it. - So AaronSmithLevin.com. - Yeah. \"A man with no moral compass.\" - \"Aaron Smith, who is he really? Aaron Smith Levin, a man\nwith no moral compass. Read about Aaron Smith-Levin, an angry man spreading hate\nfrom the Internet's shadows.\" An open mouth shot. And you're saying like at the, wow, there's testimonies. - Oh, there's videos\nfrom former co-workers. - \"The slightest thing just sets him off and he just goes totally nuts.\" Well, that one is true. I didn't understand why you slapped me before the interview.\n(Aaron laughing) I felt that. - They've got links to\neveryone else's website on the bottom. It's so funny. - Who is?\nOkay. - [Aaron] But look like.\n- Leah Remini - 2021, Church of\nScientology International. All rights reserved. Here's an example of just Scientology's complete lack of self-awareness. So me and Mike Rinder, we went halfises on like a\nhouse flip project, right? You know?\n- Wait, Mike Rinder? - [Aaron] You know Mike Rinder. - Do I? You gave me a bobblehead of the guy. I don't know him. I just, I would like to\ntalk to him about them, but this, there's a\nvery fine gentleman here with a bobblehead. - The reason we created\nthat, the bobblehead. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Is because on Mike Rinder's hate site, Scientology created a gif or a gif, how do you say it? What's the right way to say it? - The correct way is gif. - Gif, good.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Scientology created a gif of\nMike Rinder as a bobblehead. It was an insult, like \"Oh, all he does is sit\nnext to Leah Remini and go 'Yes, Leah, yes, Leah,'\" and so they made a gif\nof him with a bobblehead. So we were like, \"We're gonna\nmake Mike Rinder bobbleheads and we're gonna sell ''em on theSPshop.com to raise money for The\nAftermath Foundation. - [Lex] I love it.\n- Yeah, and now that I've. - [Lex] So go out and buy. - Yeah, go to theSPshop.com and get yourself a Mike Rinder bobblehead. Now look, now that my profile's\ngetting a little higher, this head was made to bobble like this. - [Lex] Yeah. - This smooth, shiny head\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Needs its own bobblehead now. - It does, it 100% does. I can't believe it doesn't exist. - So, but let me show you, so here's what's happening here. We just hired some day\nlaborers off of what, like Craigslist or something? - [Lex] Yeah. - So what Scientology did was they had a private\ninvestigator stake out the house flip project. They were clearly running license plates of anyone who visited the property, because otherwise, how would they find out the laborer's names, look,\ndo background checks on them. - [Lex] Yeah. - To find out they had criminal records, and they published this as if it's gonna reflect negatively on me. - [Lex] Yeah. - Oh, we hired someone to do\nwork who had a criminal record? Who gives a shit? You know, one of the biggest problems people with records have\nis finding employment. - [Lex] Yeah. - There's nothing bad about hiring someone who's got a criminal record. It doesn't reflect negatively on me. - [Lex] Wait.\n- But it shows you what they think about those people. It shows you what they think about people who are trying to put\ntheir lives back together and maybe, you know,\nactually work for a living, and it also shows that\nthey're surveilling us. Like they don't realize\nthat, putting this up, they're publishing information\nthat they could only have if they're surveilling me and Mike, and it doesn't occur to them, \"Maybe we shouldn't put that up.\" - Just the general process,\nsad to say, of journalism where they're looking\nfor any kind of dirt, and it's, they're trying\nto conjure up a story and there's something about\ndrama and negative stories that get clicks and so on. So this is a general process. The more, especially the\nmore celebrity you become, the more these kinds of attacks come, and they look for any kind\nof thing that could be, you know, it doesn't\neven have to be facts, it could be just asking\n\"Who is he really?\" seems to have traction on the internet. - [Aaron] Yeah. - What is the actual truth of the man you keep claiming you are, of the good man you keep claiming you are? - [Aaron] Right. - It's fascinating, but\nsometimes it can be effective. But I think if you're being\ntransparent and authentic and just putting yourself out there completely in your story, completely, then that's the best way to fight it. - That's the other reason to be prolific on the internet, right? The reason Joe Rogan can't get canceled is because anyone can\nwatch thousands of hours of the authentic Joe Rogan. You can't misrepresent him, 'cause he spent thousands of hours representing himself genuinely. - Yeah. The nice thing, when you're\nrepresenting yourself genuinely, you should be a good person, so if you're a good person,\nthen the internet will know. - Yeah. - They can smell out the bullshit. Who is David Miscavige? It's even like, 'cause\nyou said L. Ron Hubbard founded Scientology. - [Aaron] Yeah. - Let's go to the story\nof how we transitioned from that to David Miscavige. - The current leader of Scientology, he was actually not selected\nby L. Ron Hubbard to take over, but ended up usurping\npower and taking over. - This sounds like Stalin and Trotsky and communism, similar story. It's the person, oftentimes\nin these situation, it's not the natural successor to power, it's the one that takes power. - Right. I think the quote, sometime it gets attributed\nto David Miscavige, is \"Power is not given, it is assumed.\" - Yeah.\n- Something like that. The last six years of\nL. Ron Hubbard's life, he was off into seclusion,\nessentially hiding from lawsuits. Now, by the time Hubbard\nwent off into seclusion, Miscavige had sort of already risen up through the ranks of the Sea Organization. Now Miscavige was like a teenager, either like 11, 12, 13\nor something like that. Miscavige was not born into Scientology, but he was a young, a young boy when his father got into Scientology. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- Okay. So Miscavige did start\nworking as a Sea Org member, So there's one organization that existed to essentially serve Hubbard directly and to represent his interests, and that was called \"The Commodore.\" He was the Commodore of\nthe Sea Organization, the Commodore's Messengers Organization. We're gonna call it the CMO. Miscavige started working\nfor the CMO pretty early on in his Sea Org career, by\nthe way, as did Mike Rinder. Mini Mike. Okay.\n(Aaron laughing) And so, he just became known as a doer, like a guy who will get it done. No excuses, no stops,\nyou know, get it done. So he had made a name\nfor himself in the CMO around the time, by the time Hubbard went off into seclusion. Now, when he went off in his seclusion, he took two other CMO, I'm\ngonna call them Messengers, right, Commodore's Messengers. He took two other messengers with him, Pat and Annie Broker. Now, it has been said by people, Mike, Mike Rinder has told me, he goes, \"The reason Pat\nand Annie went off with LRH isn't necessarily because he\ndesperately wanted them to, but partly because we could\nafford to let them go. We didn't necessarily need them.\" - Sure, sure. - Okay, and between the two of them, Annie was the one who was like a really compassionate\nperson, intelligent person, caring person. - Was there a possible\ntrajectory of this world where she was the one that took over? - Yes. In fact, Pat and Annie Broker were the two people that were\nsupposed to take over. Okay. But because Pat and Annie were\nwith Hubbard in seclusion, Miscavige basically had the complete run of the operation without\nany oversight from Hubbard. The only way any information would get from Scientology world to Hubbard is Miscavige and Pat Broker would meet at a confidential location and Miscavige would give Broker any information\nhe wanted to go to LRH. So if Miscavige wanted\nto get rid of somebody, all he had to do was feed\nLRH false information that this person was doing, had been caught doing\nsomething treasonous, and then he would get, in response, some order from L. Ron Hubbard\nto get rid of this person. So are there so many similarities between various communist\nregimes and fascist regimes? - Well, Hitler did the same thing when he became the supreme leader. He had to take power. Yeah. He had to wait for the president to die, but the whole time there's\na control of information and a slow aggregation of power. Of course with nations is different, 'cause if you control the\nmilitary, you control a lot. So there's, you have to\nalso get the Generals on your side and so on, but I'm sure, in this situation there is similar kind of dynamics. You have to get certain\npeople on your side, control the flow of information, let the original founder,\nthe original leader, die off. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And make sure that you are the one that's left with the power. - Right. So whereas Pat and Annie are off with LRH, all of Scientology's\nattorneys and accountants and lobbyists and whatever,\nthey all know Dave. Dave's the one they deal with. So you know, LRH passes away. Pat and Annie make this appearance. Nobody knows Pat and Annie, everybody knows Dave, and so he ended up getting\nrid of Pat and Annie. This is a very short, perhaps slightly\nbastardized version of it, of Miscavige, basically, they had been ushering\njust suitcases of cash to L. Ron Hubbard during this time, and you know, Pat like,\nso you have Miscaviage handing boatloads of cash to Pat Broker. Pat would do crazy things like hide the money in the walls of houses and dig pits and everything, so Miscavige basically\nthreatened to turn Pat Broker over to the IRS for tax evasion. That's, Pat Broker's still alive. - Is he a Scientologist or no? - No, he basically went away\nand kept his mouth shut. - [Lex] What about Annie? - She died a handful of years ago. She stayed a loyal Sea Org\nmember until the very end, but literally like Miscavige\nput her on menial tasks like, like she had no authority whatsoever. She was just put on menial tasks. I mean, washing dishes, but\nnot really groundskeeper, just, just stupid low-level\nassistant, paper-pusher stuff. She never operated with\nany actual authority, even though she was supposed\nto be the one to take over, her and Pat. - So on David Miscavige, difficult question, but\ncan you make both the case that he is a good man who is misunderstood and the case that he's not a good man? - First of all, I believe that Miscavige is a true believer in Scientology. I do believe that. - [Lex] That's a really\nimportant question. - Yeah. - Do you think he believes\nin all the thetans and all of that? - He definitely believes in that. I think he believes in Scientology, but in a different way than\nall other Scientologists, because he's aware of\na lot more information. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Damaging information about L. Ron Hubbard and the\ntrue story of Scientology than most people, so his\nversion of belief is different. I'll give you one example here. So Scientology's Bridge to Total Freedom goes up to what they call OT eight, operating thetan level eight. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- Okay. Scientologists have all been\ntold that L. Ron Hubbard, before he passed, finished, completed, putting together 0T 9, 10,\n11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, it's just sitting in the\nvault waiting to be released. This is part of the\nScientology belief system, because remember I said going up Scientology's\nBridge to Total Freedom is how you're supposed to get back to your native, God-like state. Well, all the Scientologists in the world who've already done OT eight know that they haven't gotten there, but they still believe in Scientology because they're told there's more. \"But wait, there's more!\" - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- Miscavige knows there is no more. So Miscavige knows the fundamental promise of being able to achieve full\noperating thetan is a lie. He knows L. Ron Hubbard\ndidn't accomplish that, so therefore, no one else is\ngoing to accomplish it as well. If L. Ron Hubbard had accomplished it, Miscavige knows, well\nhe didn't write it up. He didn't leave instructions for how anyone else would accomplish it, so no matter what, Miscavige knows that\nthe fundamental promise, what Scientology is\nsaying they will be able to deliver to mankind is a lie. Now, it's gonna sound like\nI'm contradicting myself, 'cause it sounds like I'm saying \"Well he knows it's bullshit.\" I think he believes that L. Ron Hubbard just failed to finish his work and he's kind of hoping L.\nRon Hubbard's gonna come back to finish the job, 'cause L. Ron Hubbard did tell the people at the international management base, at least a core of them,\nthat he was coming back. Now, we know that David\nMiscavige believed this, because right around the 21 year mark, he was supposed to come back\nlike 21 years after he died, right around the 21 year mark, David Miscavige was getting busy putting some things in\nplace that had to get done in case L. Ron Hubbard came back. So we know he at least\nbelieved to that level. - Did he believe that like L. Ron Hubbard can sort\nof enter his own body? - [Aaron] No, that's not\nhow it works in Scientology. - Okay, so you can't have\na transfer of thetans? - If you were full OT, you could. - Can you describe the OT again? So OT levels, OT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to the 8. What are they? What's, how do you get to level one? - I'm gonna answer this question by first connecting some dots. - [Lex] Yes.\n- Okay. We spoke earlier in the interview about achieving your native, God-like - [Lex] Yes.\n- State. That, in Scientology,\nis called native state. Okay, native state and\nfull operating thetan mean the exact same thing. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- Okay, because at native state, you\nare a fully operating thetan. You know, operating meaning\noperating in your full capacity, so OT means operating thetan. So the upper confidential\nhalf of Scientology's Bridge are called the OT levels,\nthe operating thetan levels, and these, and remember,\nthey're confidential, so most Scientologists\nhave not done these levels. They don't know what's on them. It is on these levels that you learn about the Xenu and the body thetan story. - Can you describe Xenu please? - We spoke earlier about how at the lower non-confidential levels\nof Scientology's Bridge, Hubbard's saying that\nwhat's wrong with you is your reactive mind. - [Lex] Yes.\n- Okay. Well in Scientology, once you've gotten rid\nof your reactive mind, that is what's called\nthe \"State of Clear.\" - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - Okay, so after you've\nfinished State of Clear, the next thing on the\nBridge is the OT levels. Well, if you've already gotten\nrid of your active mind, what the heck are you supposed to do now? Well now L. Ron Hubbard says, \"Okay, first what was wrong with you was just your reactive mind, but now the next thing\nyou have to resolve, the next thing that's wrong with you, is you actually have tens\nof thousands of thetans stuck to your body, and they all have their\nown reactive minds. - [Lex] Oh, wow. - You have to audit the thetans. - How do you audit the thetans? Are these like different\nshades of your inner mind and you just have to try\nto access them somehow? - You use the E-meter,\njust like we spoke about, except now, you've got a\ndivider that separates the cans so they don't short circuit and you hold both cans in one hand and you have the E-meter in front of you, so now you're auditing yourself. You are telepathically\ntalking to the thetans that are stuck to you. You are thinking the commands instead of saying them out loud, and you sort of do\ndrills where you practice looking for E-meter reads at\nthe instant you have a thought. You are telepathically auditing spirits that L. Ron Hubbard says\nare stuck to your body. Does this sound like a recipe\nfor a mental breakdown? - Or a heck of a mental journey. Wherever that leads,\nit could lead anywhere. It probably could lead to\na very bad place, right? - It very often does. And you combine that with the fact that Scientology is against any forms of mental help or health\noutside of Scientology, and you have a recipe for disaster. Now you might go, \"Where did all these spirits come from that are stuck to your body?\" This is where Xenu comes into play. So Hubbard says that 75 million years ago, Xenu was basically a dictator at, the Galactic Confederation\nis like 70 something or 80 something planets, sits\nsomewhere in the Milky Way, and Xenu was like a dictator, an overlord, for either one of these\nplanets or the whole system, and they had a population problem, and Xenu was like, \"We need to get rid of\nlike half the people, so we called them all in for tax audits.\" L. Ron Hubbard didn't like the IRS, so of course, the story\nhas to do with tax audits. Okay, called ''em all in for tax audits. Said \"Psyche, bitches!\" Froze them in glycol, loaded\nthem up on space planes, flew them to Earth. Remember, the story has to be earth, because the story is what's wrong with us. Flew them to earth,\ndropped them in volcanoes, blew them up with hydrogen bombs, and then captured them\nwith like spirit magnets. I'm making up words 'cause, okay. - [Lex] Okay. - And these disembodied\nspirits of these people that got blown up have just\nbeen blowin' in the wind here on Earth, and they\nattach themselves to things and they can be in the environment and they stick to bodies and everything, and so, and they all have reactive minds. So at Scientology's upper levels, if you get sick or you have cancer or there's something wrong with you, Scientology will say \"That's\none of your body things. You need to get some auditing\nto fix the body thing.\" - So this story, you do it with\na kind of bit of a chuckle, but when done seriously, so\nit's just told in a serious way, like or written down? - [Aaron] It's written down.\n- And you read it? - By most accounts,\nScientologists struggle when they read this for the first time, because this is not consistent with what Scientologists are hoping\nfor is on the OT levels, they're hoping for some\nreal life-changing magic. - [Lex] Yeah. - The way these things\nare described and sold, they're, remember, they're\nhoping that these OT levels are gonna make them, give them the ability to go like completely independent\nof their body at will. - [Lex] Yeah. - Esterize from your body,\ngo back into your body, you know, like have\nsome real spirit powers. - So first is kind of a shock, this is, but then you still\nprobably believe, you hope. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And you might turn on yourself\nself-critical that this is, \"I'm just not strong enough yet.\" - Yeah, also part of the Scientology, remember, it works 100% of the time when used 100% correctly, and if it doesn't, it could be because something's\nnot being done right, but it also could be because\nyou're doing bad things that you're not telling people about. Like if you're committing\npresent time over its crime sins, Scientologists would be like, \"That's part of the reason\nauditing isn't working on you is because you're\ncommitting criminal behavior that you're not being honest about.\" So every Scientologist\nis sort of incentivized to make auditing work on them, okay? Now Lex, this is where\nit gets a little crazy. On OT three, you learn about the OT, the body thetans for the first time. When you finish OT three, you attest to having achieved this state of having no more body thetans. And then you start OT four, and he is like \"Psyche! You got more! You got more BT's! Except those other BT's,\nthey had drug problems, and that's why you couldn't\nfind ''em the first time. So we're gonna do a something\na little different here, do something a little different here, gotta get rid of these BT's\nthat were addicted to drugs.\" Okay? Then you finish OT four\nand you're thinking \"Man, I hope we get to\nthe good stuff soon,\" and then you get to OT five and he is like \"Psyche! You got more BT's! You couldn't find these BT's 'cause they were all bunched\nup together in clusters, and first you have to\nbreak up the clusters, and then you can get rid of the BT's.\" and you're like, \"Okay, gotta do that.\" - And this was all L.\nRon Hubbard approved? - Yeah, this is from L. Ron Hubbard. And then, after you finish OT five, you get rid of all the BT clusters, OT six is just a training course to teach you how to audit OT seven. Well, OT seven is now more BT's, except it's in the environment and stuff. You're trying to locate BT's. You can find ''em on your\nbody, but it's just more BT's. Okay, and then OT eight is,\nremember we talked about, in all these auditing sessions throughout the entire Scientology Bridge, you have people who've\nrun hundreds or thousands of past-life whole track incidents. These memories have become\npart of their self-identity, of who they even think they are. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- OT eight, you go through all\nthese past life recalls, and essentially, I'm\noversimplifying this a little bit, he goes, \"Psyche! All those past life\nmemories weren't yours. They were your BT's.\" And he goes, \"Now that\nyou've discovered this, now you know who you are not, and you are ready to find\nout who you really are.\" Well now, you're supposed to\nfind out who you really are on OT nine and 10. Those don't exist! - Do we know they don't exist? - Yes. In fact, the whole story\nof how that became known. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Is part of how David Miscavige was able\nto get rid of Pat Broker and take over power, because it was believed\nthat Pat Broker had been, was in possession of the\nupper unreleased OT levels, and when Miscavige\ndetermined that he was not, and there weren't in fact any levels, that was bad, that was a bad\nday to be David Miscavige, 'cause he now knew he had\nsomething on his hands he could not get himself out of. He's like, \"Oh, shit.\" - So there's no gap for faith to seep in that there is a level\nnine and 10, 11 and 12? - Oh, the faith is there. Scientologists believe\nthat these things do exist. - [Lex] Yeah. - L. Ron Hubbard didn't\nleave anything behind. - Does David Miscavige believe they exist? - Oh no, he knows, he knows they don't exist. No meaning when I say exist. Oh, I don't mean do advanced levels of spiritual awareness exist? When I said is, I mean, did L. Ron Hubbard write down\nwhat anyone is supposed to do - [Lex] Yeah.\nThat's called OT nine? That doesn't exist. - So you're saying\nDavid Miscavige believes that they can be written\ndown so they exist, sort of in a platonic sense, and L. Ron Hubbard is the only one that can write it down? - [Aaron] Yes. So his faith is really deep? - Oh, you mean his faith\nthat only L. Ron Hubbard could have ever been the one to do it? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Yes. The full principles,\nbeliefs of Scientology. He is, do you have, are\nyou sure he believes? - About what exactly? - Everything about Scientology? That it's true? - To the best of my ability to know that, I believe it to be true. Like, I'll give you small\nand even stupid examples, like Mike Rinder's told a story where, at the international base, Miscavige actually had like a copper, a contraption built into the ground, like grounded into the ground, to come out where you could hold it and hear something he sort of came up with to your BT, it could ground your BT's, could get your BT's that, if you were feeling\noverstimulated or something, I'm probably slightly\nbastardizing this story, but he came up with this as a great idea, of something to help someone de-stimulate if their BT's were getting\na little too overactive use. Now, so that, that's a stupid\nstory that's sort of like, well it shows you he believes\nin the concept of BT's if he's creating little\nrods to get rid of them, to ground them into the earth. - Well, he could be\nconjuring up the stories because he understands the\npower of myth and narrative and so on to, to inspire - [Aaron] Sure. To, but like, but also\nif we look at history, both with, this is the interesting thing, because I've been reading a\nlot about Hitler and Stalin and it seems like both of\nthem, in different ways, believed in the stories\nthey we're telling, even when the stories,\nthis is the fascinating, especially with Hitler and propaganda, where they were literally\nconjured up at first. - [Aaron] Hmm. - But then you start to\nbelieve you're own propaganda. With Stalin, I think\nwhat he always believed is the bigger ideal of pure communism and anything justifies\nthe journey to communism because it will ultimately\nbe good for humanity to achieve the state of pure communism, and then, he's a God-like figure that can bring humanity there, but like with Hitler, it's\ninteresting because like, there's constant propaganda\nthat he knows is not true, a little bit, there's gotta be doubt, but then he like did, all\ndoubt was removed very quickly. - [Aaron] Yeah. - So I guess humans are just,\nthis is how they operate. - Yeah. The conversation about David Miscavige gets really interesting,\nbecause I could give you a, if I wanted to make the\nargument that he didn't believe, I could give you a dozen\nexamples to make that argument. - [Lex] Yeah. I just happen to think that he believes in a different way. - [Lex] Yeah. - Whereas your average Scientologist believes that L. Ron Hubbard\nwas practically infallible, that he thought of everything in advance, he took care of everything before he left, and Miscavige still believes in like the main structure of\nthis thing, but he's like, \"Oh she, it's befalling\nto me to figure out how to actually make this thing happen.\" I think Miscavige sees\nhimself as someone who has, to a certain degree, had to go back and fix L. Ron Hubbard's mistakes. - Do you think he sees himself\nas doing good for the world? - [Aaron] I do. - What about for the\npeople of Scientology? - I think, in his own way, he does. I don't think he wakes up thinking he's screwing Scientologists. I think he sees everyone\nelse as screwing him. I think he sees that it is his job to expand Scientology throughout the world and accomplish the aims of Scientology, and he sees that it's not happening, and he thinks if everyone\nelse would just stop, if everyone else would get out of his way and stop creating problems\nfor him, it would happen. Like I do think he seems to sees himself as someone who is doing good. I think that's fair to say. I think the evidence shows that. - What about the effects of, clearly power and influence\nthat he's had, and money? - Yeah. Without question, that has\nserved as a corrupting force. - It has?\n- Without question. - Have you seen sort of evidence of that, that he's changed over time? - After the 1993 IRS exemption\nthat Scientology won back, and this information\ncomes from Mike Rinder, that's when David Miscavige, as soon as the checks on\nhis power were removed, Miscavige's behavior changed markedly. - Can you tell the story\nof Shelly Miscavige and the mystery surrounding her? I saw that there is\nquite a bit of mystery. - Yeah. So Shelly Miscavige, for many years, held the job of, her post\nin the Sea Organization was David Miscavige's assistant. That was her post. It's important to truly understand\nthat and what that means, because the fact that\nshe was Miscavige's wife is meaningless, and this is\nsomething that's hard to, for regular people in the\nregular world to truly grasp how meaningless it is in Scientology, for Sea members who are spouses. It means nothing. - Your role matters more within Sea org. - Your role's the only thing that matters. So let's say, let's say if\nShelly was married to Dave, but she worked in a\ndifferent organization, she would never be seen with\nhim, ever publicly, ever. Wouldn't travel with him. Wouldn't go to events with him. Nothing. Sometime around 2006, 2007, and I'm very oversimplifying this, okay, Shelly basically pissed off Dave to the point where he's like,\n\"Okay, I'm done with you. I'm gonna take you off of your post.\" Okay, at that point, she was reassigned to another\nconfidential Scientology base up in Twin Peaks, California. Why am I, the reason I'm\nproviding this type of detail is because we hear that Shelly's missing. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Okay. Well you realize the\nsame people who report that Shelly's missing\nare also the same people who will tell you exactly where she is? Okay, she works at this secretive CST, Church of Spiritual Technology base out in Twin Peaks, California. I have personal confirmation\nthat she was seen and spoken with by someone\nwho knew her well in, I'll say 2019. Shelly Miscavige is missing in the sense that she's hasn't been seen with David Miscavige\nsince about 2006, but because she's no longer his assistant, you would never see her with him. - As opposed to like\nthe mystery of a person that might be murdered? This is more of reallocation\nwithin the organization. - Yes, certain people\nwho cover Scientology who have published stories\nwhere Shelly Miscavige's family member told a story\nto another family member who told the story to a friend who told the story to\na former Scientologist who told the story to a journalist who published the story, has created the impression\nthat some of Shelly Miscavige's family members are actually\ntalking to the press, when in fact, that has never occurred. And so the very people who are publishing about Shelly Miscavige missing\nhave contributed to the fact that Shelly Miscavige does no longer speak to those family members because she thinks they're talking to the\npress when they never have. It's pretty messed up. - It's sad that she, 'cause\nthose family members, what, would be a way for her to recover, to flourish as a human being? To escape? - Yeah. So I believe the information\nthat I have that I've verified, I'm putting out inform, I'm the one representing it's true without revealing my sources. - [Lex] Sure. - That Shelly was still\nactively in touch regularly with family members outside\nof the Sea Organization until about 2014. So I mean regularly. Okay, so there's no\nquestion about her safety during that period, and then someone else\nwho knew Shelly very well did see her and actually\nhave a conversation with her in a public place in 2019 or 2020. Now, somebody could still\ncome along and be like, \"How do we know she's okay? It's been three years.\" Yeah, okay, you could\nsay that about anybody. You know, there's a, the nature of working in the highest levels of\nScientology management at these super secretive bases. It's a very weird and unique situation. - [Lex] Yeah. - It has isolation baked in. - How is secrecy enforced? Why is sec, why is everybody\nholding onto their stories so intensely, people that\nare within the organization? Like, it's hard to leak information. - Oh, they wouldn't wanna leak. They're true believers. They see, they see, like there's a, there's sort of a conspiracy theory that runs right through\nall of Scientology, which is that Scientology represents like an existential threat to the powers that really control this planet. - Do they have a face to the\npowers that really control? Do they have names to it? Like who's controlling? - It's Xenu's homies? - Well, I'm sure that's not what they say. Xenu embodied in? - It's actually sort of\na multifaceted conspiracy in that, on the one hand, L. Ron Hubbard points his fingers at like the international bankers. - [Lex] Okay. - Which has shades of anti-Semitism to it. - Yeah. And then the IRS is some is going to be quickly baked in or no? - The IRS, no. The IRS is so low on the totem pole. - [Lex] Oh. - As far as the, I mean\nthe international bankers, he would say runs everything. - [Lex] Got it.\n- But use, that these bankers also use big pharma and big psych to control the population, and Scientology's famously\nagainst pharma and psych, and so this is sort of how\nL. Ron Hubbard characterizes like this big war between Scientology that's trying to set everyone free. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And big pharma and big psych that's trying to enslave\neveryone on the planet. - Yeah. Controlling their mind, controlling their body through chemicals. - And who controls the press? Big pharma and big psych. - So there's a lot of correlation to other kinds of conspiracy theories? - [Aaron] Yeah. - Wow, that's fascinating. - But you asked a question where, why would all these people\nhold onto their stories? They don't, they would never wanna leak, like by even, anyone\nwho would want to leak would not not even wanna\nbe a Scientologist anymore. Like if you truly believe, if you truly believe in Scientology, and you got your shoulder to the wheel and you're a Sea Org member, you think Scientology is\nliterally the only thing that can save every being on this planet from a fate of eternal\namnesia and slavery. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Right? And so it's like, I mean, you've seen \"The Matrix,\" right? So you've got everyone, once you're unplugged from the matrix and you realize, yeah, you\ncould get plugged back in and live your nice life,\nbut you're a slave, that's how Scientologists see this planet. They actually, they they refer\nto earth as a prison planet. - Just on an individual level, how's it possible to\nreach a person like that? Like is there something\nyou could say to that? Like what's the journey of\nreaching a person like that? - I personally, because\nwhen I was in those shoes, I say there's nothing\nanybody could have said to me to get me to change how I felt and thought about Scientology. It's almost foolproof. - [Lex] Yeah. - That the more evidence\nyou try to present, that there's something wrong\nwith what Scientology is doing, the more you're just\nworking for the psychs. - [Lex] Yeah. - You know, it's very, very difficult. I mean, most people who leave Scientology leave because they have had\nsome personal experience that was just such a grave injustice that it just pushed them beyond the point of what they were willing to experience. Very rare, I've never, I'm\nnot sure I've really ever heard a story of someone\ngoing, \"Yeah, I just woke up. You know, I just gradually\nrealized it was all BS and drifted away.\" You know, it's usually like, \"No, I really believed and\nthey treated me so horribly, I almost had no choice but to leave\" and then the stories get pretty crazy. - Meaning you don't care\nwhat's true anymore, you just have to leave? - [Aaron] Yeah. - Just the unpleasant\nfeeling, the suffering. - Yeah. And this sort of goes back to\nthe conversation we're having about like, \"Well does\nMiscavige really believe?\" and I said I could make\nan argument for the fact that he doesn't, right, because I go, it wouldn't be that hard to change the way Scientology treats people. Just a little bit, and you'd\nprobably stop losing anyone, because Scientologists already believe to such a strong degree.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - You have to be pretty\nfreaking horrible to people to make them leave. And that's where you go, \"Well does Miscavige even\nwant Scientology to expand?\" because if he was really\nbeing clever about it, it seems like he could at\nleast stop the bleeding and yet he doesn't, so that's where you make the argument, \"Well, if he doesn't then\nhe must not want to.\" - So his mind is corrupted to\nthe point where he's not able to actually be a good\nbusinessman, essentially? - It seems that way. The numbers of Scientologists\nhave been going down and down and down since the early 90's. - Is there a good, I mean, it's very difficult to get to this number, but is there a good estimate\nof what the current number of Scientologists,\npracticing Scientologists is? - Oh yeah, I did a video about this. It's actually quite easy\nto get to the number. It's not more than 35,000\nin the entire world, and that's being very\ngenerous and charitable. That's, I was intentionally generous. I broke it all down in a\nspreadsheet and everything. - Yeah, what, can you\ngive like some insights of how you get that information? - Sure, there's about 175 to\n200 Scientology organizations in the world. Anybody who's ever worked\nat these organizations know there's not more than 35\nto 50 staff members per org. There's not more than 100 to 200 public Scientologists per org. I broke down the number of Sea Org members who'd be working at every\ncontinental management unit, middle management,\ninternational management. I broke down the mission\nnetwork, and I was generous. I mean, my numbers were like\nif L. Ron Hubbard came back and they were doing an event. - [Lex] Yeah. - L. Ron Hubbard was coming back and announcing OT nine and 10, how many Scientologists\ncould we scrape together in every city to come to this event? It wasn't more than 35,000. Now, contrast that to\nwhat Scientology says, millions, 10 million people. - Is this less people\nthan there used to be? - Yeah, at its peak it was\nabout 100,000 active members. - [Lex] But never the millions? - Never.\nNo. - Has David Miscavige used violence? Has there, in your understanding\nof it, in your estimation, sort of harassment, assault and actual, I don't know how to define\nassault, but violence? - Oh, yeah. Dozens of former Sea Org members\nfrom the international base have told stories of being\nassaulted by Miscavige. In fact, Mike Rinder is\nprobably the one person who's been assaulted by\nMiscavige more than anyone else. He's personally probably been\nassaulted dozens of times. - Who is Mike Rinder? The man here. - One of the highest ranking\nexecutives in Scientology. - He's an author. - There you go, \"A Billion Years.\" - Oh, \"A Billion Years.\" - It really is a fantastic book, 'cause Lex, the guy was born\nand raised in Scientology and worked personally with L. Ron Hubbard and worked personally with\nDavid Miscavige for decades, like doesn't get much\nmore insider than that. - \"A candid and deeply\nfelt memoir of a life lost to false belief and\ncourageously regained.\" Lawrence Wright. \"A Billion Years: My Escape From a Life in the Highest Ranks of Scientology.\" Mike Rinder. - It's a fantastic book. He also narrates his own audio book, too. I know you like the audio books. That's how I listen to them. - Yeah. - So Mike famously, you know,\nI just said a moment ago, like someone who's treated so horribly, even though he still\nbelieved in Scientology that he had no choice but to leave, and he tells the story in that book and he still believed in Scientology for years after he escaped, for years, 'cause there's this thing called the Independent Scientology Movement or the Free Zone or whatever, there are people who do Scientology outside of the Church of Scientology. There's just not many of them, but Mike was one of those people who was actually doing\nScientology even after he left. Now he no longer believes in that anymore and he doesn't do it, but even though he still believed, even though everything he knew was what he was leaving behind, he still had to leave it behind. - And by the way, I just\nopened to a random page, and he says, \"When I signed on for Sea Org in Adelaide in 1973, the recruiter promised I would train as a Scientology executive under the direct tutelage\nof Hubbard on the Apollo.\" So this is another thing I\nshould probably ask you about. - [Aaron] Oh, we could go for days. - \"I was also told that after I learned all I needed to learn at\nthe foot of the master, I would return to Australia\nto help expand Scientology in my home country.\" So what was the thing\nthat really broke him? - The final thing is\nwhen he got to a point where he was no longer being forced to lie to protect L. Ron Hubbard, he was now being forced to lie\nto protect David Miscavige. - [Lex] Yeah. - And specifically, it\nwas about the allegations of having been assaulted by Miscavige. Mike Rinder was at some event, it might have been a grand\nopening for a building, a Scientology building in London, and I believe it was John Sweeney, at that time, a BBC journalist who, you know, stuck a camera in\na microphone in Mike's face, \"Is it true David Miscavige assaulted you? Is it true?\" and Mike denied it on camera, and then turned around\nand to himself was like, \"This is what my life has been reduced to? Lying to protect David Miscavige? This used to be about L. Ron Hubbard. This used to be about Scientology.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - \"Now it's about\nprotecting this douche bag?\" And Miscavige had just issued orders that was gonna send Mike off to Australia. Miscavige, like Miscavige is sadistic. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - That is without question. - Sadistic meaning? - He enjoys inflicting pain upon others. So he very specifically\nwas gonna tell Mike, tell Rinder, or \"Tell that cocksucker we're shipping him off to Australia. He's never gonna see his\nwife and his kids again,\" essentially, and that's\nwhen Mike was like, \"They were the only reason\nI hadn't already left.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So if I follow the orders, I'm gonna lose them. If I leave Scientology,\nI'm gonna lose them, but at least if I leave Scientology, I'll be free of something. It's fuckin' sad. - And he still believed\nScientology to some degree after he left? - Yeah.\n- Is what you're saying? - Yeah. - Has he spoken about what it took to let go of believing in Scientology? - Yeah. He does a very good job\ntalking about all of this in the book, and it took him, it took\nhim like four or five years to get that book done, like, it's a polished version. It's a polished version of his story, and I think Mike's about getting ready to start his own YouTube channel, so that'll be a lot of fun. Actually, Mike comes on\nmy channel all the time. - Yeah, you guys do a\nthing together, right? - Yeah, we do \"The Three Amigos\" with me and Mike Rinder and Mark Hadley. (Aaron laughing) That's why I gave you Mark's book, 'cause I thought maybe you would know him from our little \"Three Amigos,\" our \"Mondays with Mike and Mark\" videos. Mark Hadley, \"Blown for Good: Behind the\nIron Curtain of Scientology.\" - So he escaped from the\ninternational base on a motorcycle. It's a wild story. I won't even try to do it justice, but. - Who's a better writer\nof the two of them? (Aaron laughing) - You're not gonna get me there, Lex. - I'm trying to be an\ninvestigative journalists once. - Mike and Mark are both on the board of The Aftermath Foundation with me. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - So.\n- Who's better looking? (Aaron laughing)\n- No, I'm just kidding. - It's one of my justifications for just putting up content every day is every video is just an excuse to, in some little way, promote\nThe Aftermath Foundation, and I do that, again, one to\ngenuinely help people escape, and two, 'cause I know it\ndrives David Miscavige crazy. - If you look in your own\nheart, is there anger there? - I don't think it's anger. I don't hate, I don't hate Scientology. I don't hate David Miscavige. I don't even hate my\nexperience in Scientology. - So you are able to accept the good? - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- From your experience? - Yeah, absolutely, but it's also the only\npath that I traveled. - [Lex] Right.\n- So I tend, okay, a little less so these\ndays, but earlier in life, I tended to attribute all\nmy positive characteristics in me to Scientology, 'cause in my simplistic way of thinking, I was like, \"What else could\nit possibly be attributed to?\" - [Lex] Right. - That's a very black and\nwhite way of seeing it. - That's a beautiful way to see life. No matter what happens to you, you attribute, like you\nfocus on the positive. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And you feel like if\nsometimes people have traumatic experiences with parents and so on. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And if you focus on the positive, it's a good way to let go.\n- [Aaron] Right. - Of the trauma associated with it. - True, but like another example would be like, I didn't go to school, Lex. I stopped going to school\nin the seventh grade, but people go, \"But you sound so smart\" and what am I supposed to do, am I supposed to say, \"Well\nit's 'cause of Scientology,\" like how do I answer that question? Like, if it's the only path I traveled, - [Lex] Yeah. - How do I answer that question? I don't necessarily wanna\ngive Scientology credit, but what the hell am I\nsupposed to point to? - [Lex] Sure.\n- You know? - I mean, you said\nthere's, you kind of enjoy, I mean part of it is\nyou joking and trolling, that you enjoy knowing\nthat your YouTube channel drives David Miscavige crazy. I mean, that means you still, I mean, there is a joy you have, right? - There is a joy. I'm not gonna deny that. - I don't know what to make of that, 'cause there's a, I\nsuppose there's an intimacy when you're part of a tribe of that kind. - It's almost like, let me try to, let me try to frame it. I wasn't trying to get\nkicked out of Scientology. I was trying to not get\nkicked out of Scientology. I, you know, so what happened first, first my mom got kicked out for basically talking some\nsmack about David Miscavige, and then they go to me and they go, \"Okay, you've gotta\ndisconnect from your mom or you're gonna get kicked out,\" and I lied about that, and I was like, \"Okay, I'll\ndisconnect,\" but I never did. For a couple years. I\nlied my ass off about it. Eventually they were like, \"This guy's gonna keep\nlying to us,\" right, and they're like, \"Yeah,\nlike all right, you're out.\" So then they go to my wife, and say \"You gotta divorce your husband or you're gonna get kicked out,\" and she goes, \"No.\" - That's a hell of a statement from her. - It's gonna get harder from here, so I'm not quite sure how to. Okay, so I'll try to,\nI'll try to do my best. - You don't seem like a man\nwho's afraid of hard things. - Okay, so she's like, \"No.\" So then they go to her\nparents and they say, \"You've gotta disconnect\nfrom your daughter and your three granddaughters, or you're gonna get kicked out,\" but they have three other\nkids who are Scientologists, who have spouses who are Scientologists, who have grandkids. So I feel like, up until that point, everybody was sort of making\na decision for themselves and what would be best for themselves, until they get to her parents, and then they're like, \"Which grandkids are we gonna lose?\" Okay? At the part where they were trying to get me to disconnect from my mom, there were hours that I\nspent talking to them going, \"You know, guys, there's another way.\" - [Lex] You know. - \"It doesn't have to go this way. There's another way that\nends well for all of us,\" and that wasn't even considered. And I go like, \"They created this monster, and that's a fact,\" and\nthat's why I take joy in it. When people ask me, \"Is Scientology a destructive cult?\" I don't even have to get into\nall the academic discussions of what's a religion and what's a cult and what's the difference, I go, \"As long as they\ndestroy families like that, they're a cult.\" - So they cut people off\ndeliberately one by one, and it doesn't have to be that way. - [Aaron] Right. - And why is it that way? - I mean, it started with L. Ron Hubbard laying out a policy\nframework, a policy structure, that if interpreted and applied\nin the worst possible way with the worst possible judgment\ncan be abused in that way. I would make the argument that if an Annie Broker had taken over, that Scientology policy does have enough little caveats baked into it, that even the policies about disconnection could be interpreted and implemented in a non-destructive way. There is room for judgment and discretion, and Miscavige has just created the worst possible version of Scientology, and that's where you sort\nof get that argument of \"Does he even want\nScientology to succeed?\" 'cause he seems to be hell bent on making sure that he doesn't. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I don't want to\nsee him make it succeed, but it does bring that\nquestion up of like, \"What are his motivations? Can he not see that he's destroying the thing he's supposed to be expanding?\" - That's also, you know,\nthere's ways to measure cost and that would probably\nbe the most costly aspect of Scientology is the suffering associated with the separating of families. - [Aaron] Yeah. - I mean that actually just puts, makes a very concrete,\nwhat we value in human life is the connection to our loved ones, like everything else doesn't matter. Like getting $50 a week, like that, like getting\nmoney stolen from you, getting the truth stolen from\nyou, none of that compares. You can even frame that as the good, as it could be a lot of\npositives, whatever, in the tribe, but separating families,\nseparating loved ones, that's the destructive thing So no hate though? - No, I genuinely don't hate them. - Do you forgive them? - 100%. There's no one I look at\nin Scientology that I go, \"How dare you.\" If I was in their shoes, having to, you know, operate\nunder David Miscavige's orders, I would've done the same\nthing and I would've loved it. Truthfully, I don't blame any of them. I mean, I take the opposite approach. If they knew what I knew,\nthey'd be doing what I'm doing. - [Lex] Yeah. - If they knew what I\nknew and believed it, they'd be doing what I'm doing. They're not dumb. It's not dumb people in Scientology. - They're ambitious, they're dreamers, they got hope, they're driven,\nall that kind of stuff. - Yeah. And it's one of the reasons I like putting up content on my channel, so they can see, \"Hey,\" like if you are a Scientologist, you look at that and you go, \"Hey, he seems like he's doing well. He's kind of, he's happy He's a positive guy. He's a good communicator. He knows what he's talking about. He's not lying. He's not exaggerating.\" I don't exaggerate anything on my channel. I don't make up anything, and this actually comes\nfrom an experience I had. From 1998 to 2000, I was living in L.A. I sort of had a two year period in my life where I actually had almost\nno contact with Scientology, and during that time, I found\nmy way onto the internet, and there was a website, it might have been ESMB,\nEx-Scientology Message Board but whatever it was, it was, at that time, the main source of critical information about Scientology on the internet. And I looked at it, and remember, I was still a true believer, and I looked at this\nand it was so offensive, insulting, hyperbolic, exaggerated. I was like, \"Oh, just\na bunch of bullshit,\" I was in Scientology for 16 more years. If what I had seen on the internet about, critical of Scientology, if what I had seen when I had seen it was something that\nactually resonated with me that I was like, \"Oh,\" that I believed was true,\nthat seemed credible, I would've gotten outta\nScientology 16 years earlier. So I was like, \"How can I help create an\nexperience on the internet that if a Scientologist stumbles upon it, it will resonate with them\ninstead of repelling them?\" And that is exactly what\nI have set out to do and what I believe I've accomplished. - There's the content, the message, but also just showing\nthat you can be happy outside of Scientology. - Exactly. - [Lex] You can have a fulfilling life. You can be a good man. - Yeah. - All of that. What benefit do you think Tom\nCruise gets from Scientology? So why is he still in Scientology? - He genuinely loves it. And also Miscavige does, there's one celebrity who does have the most unique experience in Scientology, and that is Tom. Scientology hires all of Tom's staff. There are no, all of Tom's staff are subject to interrogations\nby Scientology, not only in the hiring process, but during the employment, like David Miscavige and\nScientology runs Tom Cruise's life and his production company\nand his household staff. - Do you imagine there's some\npersonal connection there where there's just, they\nlike each other a lot? - Best friends. I mean, it's them against the world. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Is how they see it. I think it's pretty easy\nto see how that works between the two of them. - I think this idea of\nthem against the world, us against the world, is a really power, powerful, intimate, like, I kind of see like friendships and relationships that way,\nthat, not in a dark sense, but it's like the world is\nfull of cruelty and absurdity and unfairness and so on, and it's nice to huddle\ntogether like the penguins in \"March of the Penguins\" against the cold.\n(Aaron laughing) - [Aaron] 100%.\n- And they're just like, and so especially with the\nideology of Scientology, it, this idea that you can be anything. You can essentially, I mean, you can manifest it essentially\nthrough like believing it and you don't really\nput it into those words, but believing that you're a God is a really like, inspiring,\npositive thing to think. - If they could figure\nout how to do all that without destroying families\nand bankrupting its members, they might actually have a future. That's why, like, it's funny, 'cause sometimes I feel like\nit's like I'm rooting for them to like succeed and do it right. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And I'm not, but it's an interesting\nacademic discussion to have of like, we can all see how much\npeople will sacrifice in the names of belief and religion. - [Lex] Yeah. - We can see how much\nScientologists sacrifice based on what they already believe. If he would just start\ntreating people less horribly. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You know what I'm saying? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It might actually have a future, not that I want it to. - It seems like this dark\nlesson of human nature that they, that like\nthere's something about, you know, to use the word \"cults,\" that you just stop seeing\nreality for what it is because there's a lot of things that could make this a better organization that's actually helping people flourish and be a little bit more\nlike loose about membership. - [Aaron] Right.\n- Not dividing families, not causing suffering, not\ncausing financial harm, but actually inspiring\npeople and helping people, but then it maybe, it\nfundamentally changes what the organization is, and maybe that means\nsomebody like David Miscavige loses power, too, which\nmight be very difficult, or people that are close to him lose power and people hold onto power, so. - [Aaron] Yeah. - Whatever the human force is here, it seems to become worse\nand worse over time. What about, oh, lemme ask\na conspiracy question. Is there a chance that Tom\nCruise is being blackmailed? That there's information from auditing? - No?\n- [Aaron] No. So that kind of stuff is\nnot, that's very conspirator. - I've actually come out\nand said definitively I do not know of a single\nperson who stays in Scientology because they're afraid\nof being blackmailed. It's just not a thing. It's just not a thing. Does Scientology have enough information to blackmail someone if they want it to? Well, sure. I mean, and it doesn't\neven have to be true. It could just be lies. Who cares, who knows? Scientology can say\nwhatever the hell they want. So that's the thing, it\ndoesn't even have to be true. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And actually, that would be the argument\nagainst blackmailing. Like in order for Scientology to blackmail you with that information, they'd actually have to represent that, \"Yes, he really did tell us this.\" And it's like, \"Well then why are you\nspilling secrets of members?\" right, like it sets a bad precedent. - What are some of the sins\naccording to Scientology? - Most of the sins, from\na Scientology perspective, are just doing or saying anything that brings disrepute to\nScientology itself, right? Remember they don't, it's not like Christianity\nwhere there's rules, \"If you break this rule, you're\nnot getting into heaven.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - Because Scientology doesn't\nthink about things that way. - Oh, there's the drugs. You can't do drugs, right? - You can't do drugs and you can't take any\npsychotropic medications. - And no medications almost at all? - You're allowed to take medications. It's just, there's no rules\nexpressly prohibiting it, it's just most Scientologists tend not to. You can take Advil, but\nmany Scientologists won't. - [Lex] Okay. Yeah. - You just can't take anything\nprescribed by a psychiatrist, a psychologist, or any drugs\nthat are psychotropic drugs. I mean, SSRIs are considered probably the closest thing to pure evil\nin the world of Scientology. - What about, weird\nquestion, what about sex? Is there boundaries on what's? - There used to not be, it's become very puritanical\nin the last many decades for a reason I can't actually explain. Like Miscavige does seem to be infatuated with controlling sex. - [Lex] Hmm. - Like that that is one\nthing about Miscavige's version of Scientology\nthat's gotten very strange. I mean, L. Ron Hubbard even\nspecifically wrote a policy that says \"We are no longer\ngoing to regulate in any way the bedroom activities of people.\" He literally said \"From this point on, no one is allowed to be\nsubject to any justice actions of any kind whatsoever\nfor anything they do in their sexual lives,\" but that was still, it did not give permission\nfor gay relationships. That was still referring\nto straight stuff. - And monogamous only? Can you do promis-, like can you do open marriages\nand open relationships? - According to that L.Ron\nHubbard policy, you can. - Yeah, but you know. - I think he wrote that policy before he created the Sea Organization, and then what happened is, this is actually how\nthis came into effect. He created the Sea Organization. You had a lot of people on a ship and everybody was just banging each other and it created just a nightmare\nof personal relationship, that, it was, it was making\nproduction impossible, not 'cause everybody was\nspending so much time banging, but because everybody was so upset about who was banging who. - Yeah, yeah.\n(Aaron laughing) - I mean there, sex and sex\nand that kind of dynamic is really, I mean humans\ndo what humans do, and then there's drama and all that, and it understandable, 'cause\neverybody's so intimate, it's a closed tribe. It makes sense to limit\nsex, otherwise everyone's, but otherwise it becomes a sex cult. - [Aaron] Yeah. - Which a lot of them end up becoming. Well on that topic, would you classify Scientology as a cult? - 100%. But not because I'm like fully conversed with the academic differentiations between \"What's a religion and what's a cult?\" I mean, Scientology would say, \"Well all small new religions are cults,\" and I don't know, that's probably true, and some people would say\n\"All religions are cults,\" and I'd be like, \"Depends\non how you define religion, and it depends on how you define cults,\" but I just fall back on my thing of like, \"If you are destroying families,\" - [Lex] Yeah. - \"And bankrupting your\nmembers, you are a cult.\" That's how I look at it. - It's us versus them, and the \"them\" could be your family, it could be your loved ones. That's deeply destructive, and one of the things you would probably throw into a definition of a cult is something that's actually destructive. 'Cause like I do a lot of\nstuff that's occult-like, like jiu-jitsu, like there's a lot of\nreally close-knit tribes, but there's no negative toxicity to it. There's no divide. There's no divisions. Or if there is, it's more, boy, try being a fan of\na certain soccer team and then becoming a fan\nof another soccer team. - [Aaron] That's hardcore\n- And like. (both laughing) - But I'll tell you, I train jiu-jitsu as well, and I have found that community of people to be one of the most loving and helpful group of people ever. Shout out to John Keller\nat Gracie Baja Clearwater. - [Lex] Nice. - No, but seriously, like it's one of, it's one of the reasons\nI continue to do it, despite my back, my hip, my shoulder, it's like, it's just such\na cool group of guys. - The list goes on.\n(Aaron laughing) - You used to not, I think it was much more\ndivisive in the beginning from his Brazilian roots. One of the things that's really hard is that the team-oriented, like if you're this team, you're ride or die with this team, and there's no (indistinct) they go to another team. - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- And I think that aspect, that was actually a turnoff\nfor me in the beginning, the toxicity of that, because I understand that a\nlittle bit for the elites, for the highest of the highest. - [Aaron] Right.\n- But there is, I like the brotherhood and\nthe loyalty of the people, like the Olympic gold medalists, the, like the best in the world. - Yes. - [Lex] But for like recreational fun. - I know. - Like, it's like, this is all ultimately about the camaraderie of\nall human beings together, not some whatever label\nyou put on yourself. I don't think we actually talked about the organization itself. We talked about tax exempt status, which is really important. We talked about some of the control, like through the propaganda, control of what's out there. It's actually interesting that you said that like Scientology has pretty much lost the battle with the\ninternet at this point. - [Aaron] Oh yeah, yeah. - Which is kind of inspiring, that it's hard to defeat the internet, but then there's like bots there. I think, if you're sophisticated,\nI'm not sure that's true, but if you're not sophisticated. - It's kind of remarkable they haven't been able to\ncapitalize on these bot armies, 'cause there's one thing that they have, it's a lot of tax-free money that they got nothing\nelse better to do with it. - [Lex] Yeah, like they can invest. - You know, they just, they\nshould give you a call, like they just don't have\nthe right people apparently. - But, that said, how\ndo they wield influence with government agencies, with, you've talked about the local police - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- enforcement, also federal agencies, anything? - That is the one way they effectively put their money to use is\nlobbyists and attorneys. You know, judges, very rarely\nhave they ever been able just to get a politician on their side. It's the behind the scenes people. You know, Greta Van\nSustron's a very high-level, long-term Scientologist, and her husband, I always get it wrong, it's either Jim Cole or John\nCole, I always get it wrong, he's a very powerful\nattorney who has a lot, wields a lot of influence\nbehind the scenes, and that's just one example, like the reason why that's\nan interesting example is 'cause he's actually a Scientologist and he travels in those circles. Scientology though, its\nmoney goes to good use by hiring non-Scientologists, retired judges, attorneys, lobbyists. It really is how they\nget almost anything done. Like Miscavige himself is not\nhobnobbing and glad handin' and shaking hands and meeting these folks, it's the non-Scientologist professionals who work behind the scenes\non Scientology's behalf. - Can you describe the dynamics of that? How that actually happens? Like why would the, why would the police department work on behalf of Scientology? - I meant more the courts\nand court regulators, not the police department, but, well, for example, it can\ncome down to something as simple as this. In Clearwater, Scientology\nhires Clearwater Police to do off-duty work for them. They pay like three times\ntheir normal off-duty rate. So they will, even though\nI'm not aware of anyone on the Clearwater PD who's\nactually a Scientologist, they basically end up with, they would call them\nallies or safe points. - [Lex] Got it. - Right, people who like will literally operate as Scientology spies. You know, if someone comes\nin and files a report about some child sex case, someone in the Clearwater\nPD is calling Sarah Heller at the Office of Special\nAffairs at the Flan Gladden base to let her know, \"Hey, heads\nup, we got a thing coming in,\" and then Scientology can run around and go talk to all the Scientologists who have knowledge about this and either get ''em outta\nClearwater, you know? - So it's not like direct,\nexplicit corruption, but more just friends and coworkers? - [Aaron] Yeah. - Integrated deeply in the community? - Yeah, I call it soft corruption. So an another example, you have the mayor of\nClearwater, Frank Hibbard, well he used to, when he\nwon his recent election, he stepped down from\nsome of his nonprofits that he served on, but the nonprofits that he served on also gets millions of dollars of donations from some of Scientology's richest Clearwater members, right? You have one of the mayor's\nbest friends, Joe Burdette, literally a paid lobbyist for Scientology. So, that creates a chilling effect on anyone who's gonna be\ntalking smack about Scientology, because his friends are\non their damn payroll. So I call it soft corruption. It's not illegal, it's not illegal, but it's how Scientology wields influence, and what's ironic is that\na lot of these people who work on Scientology's behalf actually secretly hate Scientology. - They kinda see through it,\nbut it's part of the community. - [Aaron] Yeah. - It's deeply integrated in the community, and there's financial leverage. Are you ever afraid, I mean,\nafraid for your well-being, afraid for your ability\nto function in society because of the pressures from Scientology? - [Aaron] No. - Is that because you're\ngenetically malfunctioning or mentally, or is there, speaking out is a kind of protection? - I think it's one of those things that once you've seen behind the curtain and you see the Wizard of\nOz is just a silly man, you just don't have any fear. Now, it's one of these\nthings like people say, \"Oh, you're so brave,\" and I go, \"Eh,\" what's that quote? \"Bravery is, you know, being\na soldier and being afraid and going in any way.\" It's not brave to run in if you don't think nothing's\ngonna happen to you. Like, so I'm just trying to, like, I do not hold myself up as an example of bravery, because - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It's not like, \"Oh they could destroy\nme, but I don't care.\" No, there's not a damn\nthing they can do to me, and it's one of, that's one of the reasons I continue to put out content every day, to just basically go, \"Hey,\nstill here, I dare you to try to do something\nabout it, but you can't,\" and hope that that also\nserves as kind of an example for other people to go,\n\"If this schmo can do it\" - [Lex] Yeah. - \"and they can't do anything else to him, then maybe I can do it, too.\" Because I would love it. I would love there for be a 20 channels where former Scientologists\ntalk about their experience. - I mean, that is bravery\nbecause what happens is fear seeps in even if\nit's not grounded in reality, but at the same time, like, you know, my grandfather who fought in World War II, I mean the story is, I mean he was very convinced and sure, most of the people he\nfought alongside with died, he was a machine gunner, but he believed that bullets\ncan't hit him, right? - [Aaron] That's what he said? - Well, you know, he was\nright. (Lex laughing) Right, because he survived, so there's some sense like you're. - [Aaron] Survivor bias. - That he's like, just like you are, was like, \"I'm not brave, I\njust, the bullets can't hit me.\" (Lex laughing) I mean there's a dark\nkind of truth to that. There's some, you know, it's like, it's a feedback loop where\nif you have the confidence and you push on forward and\nyou're brave in that way to not let fear seep in and affect you, it actually gives you less\nthings to be scared about, and. - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- I mean, but that initial few steps\nmight be, for people, it might be a very difficult stuff to take to talk about publicly. - The fear was knowing how the\nfamily was gonna be destroyed and trying to prevent that. I was terrified of that happening, but it happened. There's nothing left to be afraid of. And that's kind of the thing,\nlike they created this beast, and the same is true for Mark Headley, the same is true for Mike Rinder, I said they've essentially created a Scientology-proof virus,\nScientology resistant strain, by throwing everything they have at us. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- For so many years. They have just, through natural selection, created people who just do not give a damn about anything they could or would do, and maybe there is something\na little wrong with me, 'cause when I get a\nphone call from someone, like, \"I just got this\nphone call about you\" and it's clear that at Scientology PIs doing work behind the\nscenes, I get really excited. I get really excited. I don't get nervous. I'm not gonna be like,\n\"Oh no, what's happening?\" I'm like, \"Oh yeah, this\nis gonna be exciting!\" I'm like, \"Okay!\"\n- [Lex] That's great. - Because everything they try to do to me, I'm gonna figure out how\nto reflect it back on them and make them look ridiculous. - And that pales in comparison to the separating from family. - [Aaron] Exactly. - What, is there parts of\nyour family that you've lost because of Scientology? - Just, yeah. If you, most of my episode on the Leah Remini\" and the Aftermath Show\" was talking about me and my twin brother. It's just a pretty horrible story. It's just a pretty horrible story. So I do have a younger brother\nwho's still in Scientology and disconnected from me, but I never had much of a relationship with that brother really,\nto begin with, right? But my twin brother died\nwhen I was like 23 or 24, and that was, without any question, a direct result of our\nScientology experience. You know, he died in a car accident that wasn't technically\nhis fault or anything, like, he wasn't even the one driving, but the fact, the specific\nfact of his death was not, meaning like the fact and the\nmanner of his death and time wasn't like specifically\nbecause of Scientology, but our story and how, where\nour relationship got to and how he was even in a position of having something\nlike that happen to him, is directly attributable to Scientology. - Do you think about him? Miss him? Is part of what you're\ndoing in memory of him? - Yeah, for sure. - [Lex] Man, this is such a. - I mean, you know, we\nwere identical twins. Can you imagine two of me? (Lex laughing) - I can barely handle the one! (Aaron laughing) - [Lex] I love it. - Ugh. - Losing him, would that\nbe the darkest moment in this whole journey\nof Scientology for you? - Two moments would\nequal the darkest moment. It would be that, and\nalso just the period of, you know, six, nine, 12\nmonths of impending doom, knowing that my wife's whole family was gonna be obliterated, and that there's nothing\nwe could do about it, and kind of telling ourselves\nevery step of the way, it wasn't really gonna happen. You know? And I really felt like you ever watched \"The Ozarks?\" I felt like Marty Bird. Now, this was happening\nbefore \"The Ozarks,\" but when I watch \"The Ozarks\"\nand I see that character, the entire world is\ncrumbling down around him and all he can, all I did like, \"All right, what's the next step?\" I watch Marty Bird and I go, \"That's my fucking spirit animal,\" because you can only control\nwhat you can control, and you can't keep Scientology\nfrom destroying your family, and literally, like I, it's funny, I mentioned this show a\nlot, because I watched that and I go like, \"That's\nexactly how I felt,\" you know? I talk about this six\nmonths or nine, 12 months, whatever it was, of impending doom, it's not like I was an emotional\nwreck during that time. You know, in private I was, but it's not like I was just freaking out. It was like, \"The sun's\ngonna come up tomorrow. The world's gonna keep spinning. I can't control it. This is hard. I can't believe this is happening, but tomorrow's a new day.\" I've never personally,\neven at the darkest times, I've never experienced anything that I would characterize as depression, certainly not ever any\nsuicidal thoughts or anything. Even in the darkest of times, and, again this one thing I go, \"Is it because of Scientology\nor is it just me?\" There really is an emotional detachment. There almost has to be. - And it's a cold calculation. \"What are my options? What do I do here?\"\n- Yeah. And then once I figure out\nthe answer to that question, I'm actually quite chipper and happy. You know, like that's sort of my default like you could give me\nsix horrible options, once I figure out the best of those six, I'm gonna feel like \"I just\nhad a pretty good day.\" - That's brilliant, 'cause I just, watching\n\"Ozarks,\" it was so stressful. - [Lex] It is, right?\n- So stressful watching it, and he usually finds a way, and usually it is a set\nof really bad options and it is one of the bad options, what's the best of the bad options? - And he almost gets pissed\noff at everyone around him for being so pouty about it. - [Lex] Yeah. (Aaron laughing) - Oh no, I'll never watch that show again, the same way again. Oh that's beautiful.\n- But you know, it's like, you know, it's still simmering there\nright under the surface, like pretty damn close to the surface. Do you know what I mean? - Yeah. Yeah. - And people sometimes ask\nabout recovery and whatnot and like, what does that look\nlike and what does that mean, and this sort of goes back to kind of the emotional detachment, is I go, \"What the fuck\ndoes recovery even mean?\" I mean, if you're an alcoholic\nand you're recovering, you know what that means. \"I used to drink. I don't drink now.\" Well I used to be an a cult\nand I'm not an a cult now. How else am I supposed to feel about this for someone to be like, \"It\nseems like you've recovered.\" What the fuck does that even mean? Like I'm sure some academic\nhas an answer to that question. I'm not someone who partic-, I don't spend any time\nthinking about that. My recovery is success and a little bit of trolling and revenge. - [Lex] Yeah. - But mostly success. You know, what does it mean to be a recovered former cult member? What, you don't cry when people\nask you about your brother? I don't know what it means. - [Lex] Yeah. - I've never had therapy, but not because I'm still like\nagainst it from Scientology, I just like, I'm not gonna\npay to talk to someone. Do you know where else I could do that? Scientology.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Now I know there's a\nlot of people going like, \"Oh boy, he.\" I know there's a lot. I'm not shitting on therapy. I would rather have a beer with my friend and talk about this shit.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Than talk to a professional\nfor $200 an hour. - That is a kind of therapy, yeah. - [Aaron] Yeah.\n- Yeah, listen, That's part of the\nreason I do this podcast. It's talking to people\nthat you care about, that you're close with, it's a really powerful, powerful thing. But yeah, I don't know\nwhat a recovery looks like. And success to you is defined,\njust be \"Find happiness.\" Find happiness outside the closed bubble that defines what happiness\nlooks like, of Scientology. - If I can make my kids\nhappy, that's success to me. - What advice would you give\nto your kids on how to live? - [Aaron] Travel the world. - A life they can be proud of? Travel the world? - Travel the world. Get rid of friends who don't push you up and don't celebrate your success. It's hard to give that\nadvice to young children, 'cause kids are always so catty, but honestly it's like, when I see, that really is, I just think,\nnot just advice to my kids, but some of the best advice to anybody. - [Lex] Yeah. - If you've got anyone around you who doesn't celebrate your success, just spend less time with those people. - [Lex] Yeah. - Surround yourself with people who actually wanna celebrate your success and push you to succeed. I think that's true, I think it's even more\nimportant at a young age, 'cause if, at a young age, you get used to being\naround people who kind of take joy in tearing you down, then that's what you become accustomed to. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You know? And I just think, you know, having friends who love\nyou and support you is just about the closest thing\nto the true meaning of life. - And who believe in you, who believe in your potential, and some of those ideas underlie the good parts of Scientology. - [Aaron] Yeah. - And except there's a lot\nof dark parts of Scientology that separate you from the\npeople that believe in you and that love you. Well, this was a beautiful conversation. You're a beautiful human being who came full of gifts, and I mean, I, genuinely, first of all, you're an inspiring human being, but most importantly, I can't wait until I can purchase\na bobblehead on the store. (Aaron laughing) - So I can keep that\ninspiration on my desk top. Aaron, thank you so\nmuch for talking today. Thank you for being you, for being brave. I know you said you're not, but thank you for being\nbrave for talking about this. You're an inspiration and\nyou help a lot of people. Thank you, brother. - Thanks for having me. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Aaron Smith-Levin. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, I'm gonna leave\nyou with some words from Ralph Waldo Emerson. \"Be not the slave of your own past. Plunge into the sublime seas. Dive deep and swim far, so you will come back\nwith new self-respect, with new power, and with\nan advanced experience that will explain and overlook the old.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
