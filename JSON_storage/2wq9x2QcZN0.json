      "text": "- The following is a\nconversation with Eric Weinstein. He's a mathematician, economist, physicist and the managing\ndirector of Thiel Capital. He coined the term and you could say, is the founder of the\nIntellectual Dark Web, which is a loosely assembled\ngroup of public intellectuals that includes Sam Harris,\nJordan Peterson, Steven Pinker, Joe Rogan, Michael\nShermer and a few others. This conversation is part of\nthe artificial intelligence podcast at MIT and Beyond. If you enjoy it, subscribe\non YouTube, iTunes, or simply connect with me\non Twitter @lexfridman, spelled F-R-I-D. And now, here's my conversation\nwith Eric Weinstein. - Are you nervous about this? - Scared shitless. - Okay, (speaking foreign language). - You mention Kung Fu Panda as\none of your favorite movies. It has the usual profound\nmaster student dynamic going on, so who has been a teacher\nthat significantly influenced the direction of your\nthinking and life's work? So, if you're the Kung Fu\nPanda, who was your Shifu? - Oh, well that's interesting, because I didn't see Shifu\nas being the teacher. - Who was the teacher? - Oogway, Master Oogway, the turtle. - Oh, the turtle, right. - They only meet twice in the entire film and the first conversation\nsort of doesn't count. So, they magic of the\nfilm, in fact, it's point is that the teaching that\nreally matters is transferred during a single conversation\nand it's very brief. And so, who played that role in my life? I would say either my\ngrandfather, Harry Rubin and his wife Sophie Rubin,\nmy grandmother or Tom Lehrer. - Tom Lehrer?\n- Yeah. - In which way? - If you give a child Tom Lehrer records, what you do is you destroy their ability to be taken over by later malware, and it's so irreverent, so\nwitty, so clever, so obscene, that it destroys the ability to lead a normal life for many people. So if I meet somebody who's\nusually really shifted from any kind of neuro\ntypical presentation, I'll often ask them,\nare you a Tom Lehrer fan and the odds that they will\nrespond are quite high. - Now Tom Lehrer is Poisoning\nPigeons in the Park, Tom Lehrer?\n- That's very interesting. There are a small number\nof Tom Lehrer songs that broke into the general population. Poisoning Pigeons in the Park, the Element Song and\nperhaps the Vatican Rag. So, when you meet somebody\nwho knows those songs, but doesn't know-- - Oh, you're judging me\nright now, aren't you? - Harshly.\n- Okay. - No, but you're Russian, so.\n- Yes. - Undoubtedly you know\nNikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky. That song.\n- Yes, yeah, yup. - So that was a song about plagiarism that was in fact plagiarized, which most people don't\nknow, from Danny Kaye. Where Danny Kaye did a song called Stanislavsky of the musky arts. And, so Tom Lehrer did this brilliant job of plagiarizing a song and\nmaking it about plagiarism, and then making it about\nthis mathematician, who worked in Non-Euclidean geometry. That was like giving heroin to a child. It was extremely addictive and eventually led me to a lot of different places. One of which may have\nbeen PhD in mathematics. - And he was also at least\na lecturer in mathematics, I believe at Harvard, something like that? - Yeah, I just had\ndinner with him, in fact. When my son turned 13, we didn't tell him, but his Bar mitzvah present was dinner with his hero, Tom Lehrer, and Tom Lehrer was 88\nyears old, sharp as a tack, irreverent and funny as\nhell and just, you know, there are very few people in this world that you have to meet\nwhile they're still here and that was definitely\none for our family. - So that wit is a\nreflection of intelligence in some kind of deep way. Like where that would be a good test of intelligence whether\nyou're a Tom Lehrer fan. So, what do you think that is about wit? About that kind of humor, ability to see the absurdity in existence? Do you think that's connected\nto intelligence or are we just two Jews on a mic that\nappreciate that kind of humor. - No, I think that it's absolutely connected to intelligence. You can see it, there's a\nplace where Tom Lehrer decides that he's going to lampoon\nGilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan and he's going to out\ndue Gilbert with clever, meaningless wordplay and he has, I forget the, well let's see. He's doing Clementine as if\nGilbert and Sullivan wrote it and he says that I missed her, depressed her young sister named Esther. This mister to pester she'd tried. A pestering sister's a festering blister you're best to resist her, say I! The sister persisted, the mister resisted, I kissed her, all loyalty slipped. When she said I could have\nher her sister's cadaver must surely have turned in its crypt. That's so dense. It's so insane.\n- Yeah. - That that's clearly intelligence because it's hard to construct\nsomething like that. If I look at my favorite\nTom Lehrer lyric, you know, there's a perfectly absurd one which is, once all the German's\nwere warlike and mean, but that couldn't happen again. We taught them a lesson in 1918 and they've hardly bothered us since then. - Right.\n- That is a different kind of intelligence. You know, you're taking\nsomething that is so horrific and you're sort of making\nit palatable and funny, and demonstrating also just your humanity. I mean, I think the thing that\ncame through as Tom Lehrer wrote all of these\nterrible, horrible lines, was just what a sensitive\nand beautiful soul he was, who was channeling pain through\nhumor and through grace. - I've seen throughout\nEurope, throughout Russia, the same kind of humor emerged from the generation of World War II. It seemed like that humor\nis required to somehow deal with the pain and the suffering\nof that that war created. - Well, you do need the environment to create the broad Slavic soul. I don't think that many\nAmericans really appreciate Russian humor, how you had\nto joke during the time of let's say, Article 58 under Stalin. You had to be very, very careful. You know, the concept of a\nRussian satirical magazine, like Krokodil, doesn't make sense. So you have this cross\ncultural problem that there are certain areas of human\nexperience that it would be better to know nothing\nabout and quite unfortunately, eastern Europe knows a\ngreat deal about them, which makes the songs of\nVladimir Voevodsky so potent. You know, the prose of\nPushkin, whatever it is. You have to appreciate the\ndepth of the Eastern European experience and I would think\nthat perhaps Americans knew something like this around\nthe time of the Civil War or maybe under slavery and Jim Crow or even the harsh tyranny of the coal and steel employers during the labor wars. But in general I would say,\nit's hard for us to understand and imagine the collective culture, unless we have the system\nof selective pressures, that for example, Russians\nwere subjected to. - Yeah, so if there's one good\nthing that comes outta war, it's literature, art and humor and music. - Oh, I don't think so. I\nthink almost everything is good about war except for\ndeath and destruction. - Right. Without the death it would\nbring the romance of it, the whole thing is nice but-- - Well, this is why we're\nalways caught up in war. We have this very ambiguous\nrelationship to it, is that it makes life real\nand pressing and meaningful, and at an unacceptable price and the price has never been higher. - So to jump into AI a little bit, in one of the conversations\nyou had or one of the videos, you described that one of the\nthings AI systems can't do and biological systems\ncan is self replicate in the physical world. - [Eric] Oh, no, no. - In the physical world. - Well, yes. The physical robots can't self replicate, but there's a very tricky point, which is that the only\nthing that we've been able to create that's really\ncomplex that has an analog of our reproductive system is software. - But, nevertheless,\nsoftware replicates itself, if we're speaking strictly\nfor the replication is this kinda digital space. So let me, just to begin,\nlet me ask a question. Do you see a protective barrier or a gap between the physical world\nand the digital world? - Let's not call it digital. Let's call it the logical world\nversus the physical world. - Why logical? - Well, because even though we had, let's say Einstein's brain preserved, it was meaningless to\nus as a physical object because we couldn't do anything with what was stored in it at a logical level. And so, the idea that something\nmay be stored logically and that it may be stored\nphysically, are not necessarily, we don't always benefit from synonymizing. I'm not suggesting that\nthere isn't a material basis to the logical world,\nbut that it does warrant identification with a separate layer that need not invoke logic\ngates and zeros and ones. - And, so connecting those two worlds, the logical world and the\nphysical world or maybe just connecting to the logical\nworld inside our brain, Einstein's brain, you mention\nthe idea of outtelligence. - [Eric] Artificial outtelligence. - Artificial outtelligence.\n- Yes, this is the only essay that John Brockman every\ninvited me to write that he refused to publish in Edge. (Lex chuckling) - Why? - Well, maybe it wasn't well\nwritten, but I don't know. - The idea is quite compelling. It's quite unique and new, at\nleast from my stance point. Maybe you can explain it? - Sure. What I was thinking about is\nwhy it is that we're waiting to be terrified by artificial\ngeneral intelligence. When in fact, artificial\nlife is terrifying in and of itself and it's already here. So, in order to have a system\nof selective pressures, you need three distinct elements. You need variation within a population, you need heritability, and\nyou need differential success. So, what's really unique\nand I've made this point, I think elsewhere, about software, is that if you think about what humans know how to build that's impressive. So, I always take a car\nand I say does it have an analog of each of the\nphysiological systems? Does it have a skeletal\nstructure, that's its frame. Does it have a neurological structure, it has an onboard computer. It has a digestive system. The one thing it doesn't have\nis a reproductive system. But if you can call spawn on a process, effectively you do have\na reproductive system. And that means that you\ncan create something with variation, heritability\nand differential success. Now, the next step in\nthe chain of thinking was where do we see inanimate\nnon intelligent life outwitting intelligent life? And I have two favorite\nsystems and I try to stay on them so that we don't get distracted. One of which is the Ophrys\norchid sub species or sub clave, I don't what to call it. - Is that a type of flower?\n- Yeah, it's a type of flower that mimics the female\nof a pollinator species in order to dupe the males\ninto engaging in what is called pseudocopulation,\nwith the fake female, which is usually represented\nby the lowest pedal, and there's also a pheromone\ncomponent to fool the males into thinking they have\na mating opportunity. But the flower doesn't have\nto give up energy in the form of nectar as a lure, because\nit's tricking the males. The other system is a\nparticular species of muscle, lampsilis in the clear streams\nof Missouri and it fools bass into biting a fleshy lip that\ncontain its young and when the bass see this fleshy\nlip, which looks exactly like a species of fish that\nthe bass like to eat, the young explode and clamp\nonto the gills and parasitize the bass and also use\nthe bass to redistribute them as they eventually release. Both of these systems, you\nhave a highly intelligent dupe, being fooled by a lower life form. And what is sculpting\nthese convincing lures? It's the intelligence of previously duped targets for these strategies. So when the target is smart\nenough to avoid the strategy, those weaker mimics fall off,\nthey have terminal lines, and only the better ones survive. So it's an arms race\nbetween the target species that is being parasitized,\ngetting smarter, and this other less intelligent or non intelligent object\ngetting as if smarter. And so, what you see is,\nis that artificial general intelligence is not\nneeded to parasitize us. It's simply sufficient for\nus to outwit ourselves, so you could have a program, let's say, one of these Nigerian\nscams that writes letters and uses whoever sends it\nBitcoin to figure out which aspects of the program should be kept, which should be varied and thrown away, and you don't need it to\nbe in anyway intelligent in order to have a really\nnightmare scenario being parasitized by something that\nhas no idea what it's doing. - So you phrased a few\nconcepts really eloquently, so let me try to, there's\na few directions this goes. So one, first of all, in the\nway we write software today, it's not common that we\nallow it to self modify. - But we do have that ability now. - We have the ability.\n- It's just not common. - I just isn't common. So your thought is that that is a serious worry if there becomes-- - But self modifying\ncode is available now. - So there's different types\nof self modification right? There's personalization,\nyou know your email app, your Gmail is self modifying\nto you after you login or whatever, you can think of that way. But ultimately it's central,\nall the information is centralized, but you're\nthinking of ideas where you're, this is a unique entity operating under selective pressures and it changes-- - Well, you just, if you\nthink about the fact that our immune systems don't know\nwhat's coming at them next, but they have a small set\nof spanning components, and if it's a sufficiently\nexpressive system in that any shape or binding region can\nbe approximated with the Lego that is present, then\nyou can have confidence that you don't need to\nknow what's coming at you because the combinatorics are sufficient to reach any configuration needed. - So that's a beautiful, well\nterrifying thing to worry about because it's so within our reach. - Whenever I suggest\nthese things I do always have a concern as to whether\nor not I will bring them into being by talking about them. - So there's this thing\nfrom OpenAI next week, to talk to the founder of OpenAI, this idea that their text generation, the new stuff they have\nfor generating text is, they didn't wanna bring it,\nthey didn't wanna release it because they're about the-- - I'm delighted to hear that, but they're going to end up releasing. - Yes, that's the thing is\nI think talking about it, well at least from my end, I'm more a proponent of\ntechnology preventing, so further innovation preventing the detrimental effects of innovation. - Well we're in a, we're\nsort of tumbling down a hill at accelerating speed. So, whether or not we're proponents or-- - It doesn't really matter.\n- It may not matter. - But I.\n- Well, may not. - Well, I do feel that there are people who have held things back and you know, died poorer than they\nmight have otherwise been. We don't even know their names. I don't think that we should\ndiscount the idea that having the smartest people showing\noff how smart they are by what they've developed may\nbe a terminal process. I'm very mindful in particular\nof a beautiful letter that Edward Teller of all\npeople wrote to Leo Szilard where Szilard was trying to\nfigure out how to control the use of atomic weaponry at the\nend of World War II and Teller rather strangely, because many\nof us view him as a monster, showed some very advanced\nmoral thinking talking about the slim chance we have for survival and that the only hope is\nto make war unthinkable. I do think that not enough\nof us feel in our gut, what it is we are playing\nwith when we are working on technical problems, and I\nwould recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it, a movie called\nA Bridge on the River Kwai, about I believe captured British POWs who just in a desire to do a bridge well, end up over collaborating\nwith their Japanese captors. - Well, now you're making me question the unrestricted open\ndiscussion of ideas and AI. - I'm not saying I know the answer, I'm just saying that I\ncould make a decent case for either our need to talk about this and to become technologically\nfocused on containing it or need to stop talking about\nthis and try to hope that the relatively small number\nof highly adept individuals who are looking at these\nproblems is small enough that we should in fact be talking\nabout how to contain it. - Well, the way ideas, the\nway innovation happens, what new ideas develop,\nNewton with calculus. Whether if he was silent, the\nidea would emerge elsewhere, well in case of Newton, of course, but you know, in case of\nAI, how small is this set of individuals out of which\nsuch ideas would arise? Is it in question--\n- Well, the ideas of the researchers we know and\nthose that we don't know. Who may live in countries\nthat don't wish us to know what level they're currently\nat and are very disciplined in keeping these things to themselves. Of course, I will point out that there is a religious school in\nKerala that developed something very close to the calculus,\ncertainly in terms of infinite series in, I guess religious prayer and rhyme and prose. So, you know, it's not\nthat Newton had any ability to hold that back and\nI don't really believe that we have an ability to hold back. I do think that we could change\nthe proportion of the time we spend worrying about\nthe effects of what if we are successful, rather\nthan simply trying to succeed and hope that we'll be able\nto contain things later. - Beautifully put. So, on the idea of\nouttelligence, what form, treading cautiously 'cause we've agreed as we tumbled down the hill. What form--\n- Can't stop ourselves can we? - We cannot. What form do you see it taking? So one example, Facebook,\nGoogle, do want to, I don't know a better\nword, you want to influence users to behave a certain way. And so that's one kind of\nexample of outtelligence, is systems perhaps modifying the behavior of these intelligent human beings in order to sell more product of different kind. But do you see other examples\nof this actually emerging in? - Just take any parasitic\nsystem, you know? Make sure that there's some\nway in which that there's differential success,\nheritability and variation, and those are the magic ingredients. And if you really wanted to\nbuild a nightmare machine, make sure that the system\nthat expresses the variability has a spanning set, so that it\ncan learn to arbitrary levels by making it sufficiently expressive. That's your nightmare. - So, it's your nightmare,\nbut it could also be, it's a really powerful\nmechanism by which to create, well, powerful systems. So, are you more worried\nabout the negative direction that might go versus the positive? So, you said parasitic, but\nthat doesn't necessarily need to be what the\nsystem converges towards. It could be, what is it, symbiotic-- - Well, parasitism, the\ndividing line between parasitism and symbiosis is not so clear. - [Lex] That's what they\ntell me about marriage. I'm still single, so I don't know. - Well, yeah I do. Would could go into that\ntoo, but um. (Lex laughing) No, I think we have to\nappreciate, you know, are you infected by your own mitochondria? - Right. Yeah.\n- Right, so in marriage you fear the loss of independence, but even though the American\ntherapeutic community may be very concerned about co-dependence, what's to say that co-dependence\nisn't what's necessary to have a stable relationship\nin which to raise children who are maximally K-selected and require incredible amounts of care, because you have to wait 13 years before there's any reproductive\npayout and most of us don't want our 13 year olds having kids. That's a very tricky situation to analyze. I would say that predators\nand parasites drive much of our evolution and I don't know whether to be angry at them or thank them. - Well, ultimately, I mean,\nnobody knows the meaning of life or what even happiness is,\nbut there is some metrics-- - Oh, they didn't tell you?\n- They didn't, they didn't. That's why all the poetry\nand books are bought. You know, there are\nsome metrics under which you can kinda measure how good it is that these AI systems are roaming about. So, you're more nervous\nabout software than you are optimistic about ideas\nof self replicating larceny? - I don't think we've\nreally felt where we are. You know, occasionally we get a wake up. 9/11 was so anomalous\ncompared to everything else we've experienced on American\nsoil, that it came to us as a complete shock that\nthat was even a possibility. What it really was, was a\nhighly creative and determined RND team deep in the bowels\nof Afghanistan showing us that we had certain\nexploits that we were open to, that nobody had chosen to express. I can think of several of\nthese things that I don't talk about publicly, that\njust seem to have to do with how relatively unimaginative\nthose who wish to cause havoc and destruction\nhave been up until now. The great mystery of our time, of this particular little era, is how remarkably stable\nwe've been since 1945 when we demonstrated the ability to\nuse nuclear weapons in anger. And, we don't know why things like that haven't happened since then. We've had several close\ncalls, we've had mistakes, we've had brinkmanship and\nwhat's now happened is that we've settled into a sense that\noh, it'll always be nothing. It's been so long since\nsomething was at that level of danger, that we've got\na wrong idea in our head and that's why when I went\non the Ben Shapiro Show, I talked about the need to\nresume above ground testing of nuclear devices because\nwe have people whose developmental experience\nsuggests that when, let's say Donald Trump and\nNorth Korea engage on Twitter, oh it's nothing, it's just\nposturing, everybody's just in it for money, there's\na sense that people are in a video game mode, which has\nbeen the right call since 1945. We've been mostly in video game mode. It's amazing. - So you're worried about a generation which has not seen any existential-- - We've lived under it. See, you're younger. I don't know if, and again,\nyou came from Moscow. - [Lex] From, yeah. - There was a TV show called\nThe Day After that had a huge effect on a generation\ngrowing up in the US, and it talked about what life would be like after a nuclear exchange. We have not gone through\nan embodied experience collectively where we've\nthought about this, and I think it's one of\nthe most irresponsible things that the elders among us have done, which is to provide this beautiful garden in which the thorns are\ncut off of the rosebushes and all of the edges\nare rounded and sanded, and so people have developed\nthis totally unreal idea which is everything is\ngoing to be just fine. And do I think that my\nleading concern is AGI or my leading concern is\nthermonuclear exchange or gene drives or any one of these things? I don't know. But I know that our time here\nin this very long experiment here is finite, because\nthe toys that we've built are so impressive and\nthe wisdom to accompany them has not materialized. And I think we actually got\na wisdom uptick since 1945. We had a lot of dangerous,\nskilled players on the world stage who nevertheless, no\nmatter how bad they were, managed to not embroil us in something that we couldn't come back from. - The Cold War.\n- Yeah, and the distance from the Cold War, you\nknow, I'm very mindful of, there was a Russian tradition, actually, of on your wedding day going to visit a memorial to those who gave their lives. Can you imagine this? Where on the happiest day of your life, you go and you pay homage\nto the people who fought and died in the Battle of Stalingrad? I'm not a huge fan of\ncommunism, I gotta say, but there were a couple of\nthings that the Russians did that were really positive\nin the Soviet era, and I think trying to let people know how serious life actually\nis, is the Russian model of seriousness is better\nthan the American model. - And maybe, like you mentioned, there was a small echo\nof that after 9/11, but-- - We wouldn't let it form. We talk about 9/11, but it's 9/12 that really moved the needle. When we were all just there\nand nobody wanted to speak. We witnessed something super serious and we didn't want to run to our computers and blast out our deep\nthoughts and our feelings. And it was profound because\nwe woke up, briefly, and I talk about the gated\ninstitutional narrative that sort of programs our lives, I've seen it break three times in my life. One of which was the\nelection of Donald Trump, another time was the\nfall of Lehman Brothers, when everybody who knew that\nBear Stearns wasn't that important, knew that Lehman\nBrothers met AIG was next, and the other one was 9/11. And so, if I'm 53 years old\nand I only remember three times that the global narrative\nwas really interrupted, that tells you how much we've been on top of developing events, you know? We had the Murrah Federal\nBuilding explosion, but it didn't cause\nthe narrative to break, it wasn't profound enough. Around 9/12, we started to\nwake up out of our slumber, and the powers that be, did\nnot want a coming together. You know, the admonition was go shopping. - The powers that be,\nso what is that force? As opposed to blaming individuals-- - We don't know.\n- So whatever that-- - Whatever that force is. - In silence.\n- There's a component of it that's emergent and there's a component of it that's deliberate. So, give yourself a portfolio\nwith two components. Some amount of it is\nemergent, but some amount of it is also an understanding\nthat if people come together, they become an incredible force. And what you're seeing\nright now, I think is, there are forces that are\ntrying to come together and there are forces that are\ntrying to push things apart, and you know, one of them\nis the globalist narrative versus the national narrative. Where to the globalist perspective, the nations are bad things in essence. That they're temporary,\nthey're nationalistic, they're jingoistic, it's all negative, to people more in the national\nidiom, they're saying look, this is where I pay my taxes, this is where I do my army service, this is where I have a vote, this is where I have a passport. Who the hell are you to tell\nme that because you've moved into some place that you\ncan make money globally, that you've chosen to abandon other people to whom you have a\nspecial and elevated duty. And I think that these\ncompeting narratives have been pushing towards the global\nperspective from the elite and a larger and larger\nnumber of disenfranchised people are saying, hey, I\nactually live in a place and I have laws and I speak\na language, I have a culture, and who are you to tell me\nthat because you can profit in some far away land, that\nmy obligations to my fellow countrymen are so much diminished. - So these tensions\nbetween nations and so on, ultimately you see being proud\nof your country and so on, which creates potentially the kind of things that led to wars and so on. They ultimately, it is human\nnature and it is good for us, for wake up calls of different kinds. - Well, I think that these are tensions. And my point isn't, I mean nationalism run amuck is a nightmare. And internationalism run\namuck is a nightmare. And the problem is we're\ntrying to push these pendulums to some place where\nthey're somewhat balanced. Where we have a higher duty\nof care to those who share our laws and our citizenship,\nbut we don't forget our duties of care to the global system. I would think this is elementary, but the problem that we're\nfacing concerns the ability for some to profit by abandoning\ntheir obligations to others within their system and that's\nwhat we've had for decades. - You mention nuclear weapons. I was hoping to get answers\nfrom you since one of the many things you've done as economics, maybe you can understand human behavior of why the heck we haven't\nblown each other up yet. But okay, so we'll get-- - I don't know the answer.\n- Yeah. It's really important to say\nthat we really don't know-- - [Eric] A mild uptick in wisdom. - A mild uptick in wisdom,\nSteven Pinker who I've talked with has a lot of really good\nideas about why, but he-- - I don't trust his optimism. (Lex chuckling) - Listen, I'm Russian,\nso I never trust a guy who's that optimistic-- - No, no, no, it's just\nthat you're talking about a guy who's looking at a\nsystem in which more and more of the kinetic energy, like\nwar, has been turned into potential energy like\nunused nuclear weapons. - Wow, beautifully put.\n- And you know now I'm looking at that system and I'm saying, okay, well if you don't have\na potential energy trim, then everything's just\ngetting better and better. - Yeah, yeah, wow, that's beautifully put. Only a physicist could, okay. - [Eric] I'm not a physicist. - Well, is that a dirty word? - [Eric] No, no, I wish\nI were a physicist. - Me too, my dad's a physicist. I'm trying to live up to that probably for the rest of my life. He's probably gonna\nlisten to this too, so. - Hey dad.\n- Yeah, (chuckling). So, your friend, Sam Harris, worries a lot about the\nexistential threat of AI. Not in the way that you've\ndescribed, but in the more. - Well, he hangs out with Elon. I don't know Elon. - So, are you worried about that kind of, you know, about the, about\neither robotics systems or traditionally defined\nAI systems essentially becoming super intelligent,\nmuch more intelligent than human beings and getting-- - Well, they already are, and they're not. - When seen as a collective, you mean? - I can mean all sorts of things, but certainly, many of\nthe things that we thought were peculiar to general intelligence do not require general intelligence. So that's been one of the big\nawakenings that you can write a pretty convincing sports\nstory from stats alone. Without needing to have watched the game. So, you know, is it\npossible to write lively prose about politics? Yeah, no, not yet. So, we're sort of all over the map. One of the things about chess, there's a question I once asked on Quora that didn't get a lot of response, which was, what is the greatest\nbrilliancy ever produced by a computer in a chess game? Which was different than the question of what is the greatest game ever played. So if you think about brilliancies, is what really animates many of us to think of chess as an art form. Those are those moves and combinations that just show such\nflair, panache and soul. Computers weren't really great at that. They were great positional monsters. And recently we've started\nseeing brilliancies. - [Lex] Yeah, a few\ngrandmasters have identified with AlphaZero that things\nwere quite brilliant. - Yeah, so that's an example of something. We don't that that's AGI,\nbut in a very restricted set of rules like chess,\nyou're starting to see poetry of a high order. And so I don't like the idea\nthat we're waiting for AGI. AGI is sort of slowly infiltrating\nour lives in the same way that I don't think a worm should be, you know C. Elegans shouldn't\nbe treated as non conscious because it only has 300 neurons. Maybe it just has a very\nlow level of consciousness. Because we don't understand what these things mean as they scale up. So, am I worried about\nthis general phenomena? Sure, but I think that one of the things that's happening is that\na lot of us are fretting about this in part because of human needs. We've always been worried\nabout the Golem, right? - [Lex] Well, the Golem is\nthe artificially created-- - Life, you know? - [Lex] It's like Frankenstein\ntype of character-- - Yeah, sure, it's a Jewish version. Frankenberg, Franken-- - Yeah, that makes sense. - Sorry, so the, but we've\nalways been worried about creating something like\nthis and it's getting closer and closer and there are ways\nin which we have to realize that the whole thing, the whole thing that we've experienced are\nthe context of our lives, is almost certainly coming to an end. And I don't mean to suggest that we won't survive, I don't know. And I don't mean to suggest\nthat it's coming tomorrow. It could be 300, 500\nyears, but there's no plan that I'm aware of, if\nwe have three rocks that we could possibly inhabit that\nare sensible within current technological dreams; the\nEarth, the Moon and Mars, and we have a very\ncompetitive civilization that is still forced\ninto violence to sort out disputes that cannot be arbitrated. It is not clear to me that we\nhave a long term future until we get to the next stage,\nwhich is to figure out whether or not the Einsteinian\nspeed limit can be broken, and that requires our source code. - Our source code, the stuff\nin our brains to figure out? What do you mean by our source code? - The source code of the context. Whatever it is that produces the quarks, the electrons, the neutrinos. - Oh, our source code,\nI got it, so this is-- - You're talking about\nthe stuff that's written in a higher level language. - Yeah, yeah, that's right. You're talking about the low\nlevel, the bits or even lower-- - Right, that's what is\ncurrently keeping us here. We can't even imagine, you\nknow, we have hair brain schemes for staying within the\nEinsteinian speed limit. You know, maybe if we\ncould just drug ourselves and go into a suspended state or we could have multiple generations of that. I think all that stuff is pretty silly. But, I think it's also pretty\nsilly to imagine that our wisdom is going to\nincrease to the point that we can have the toys we have and we're not going to use them for 500 years. - Speaking of Einstein, I had\na profound breakthrough when I realized you're just one\nletter away from the guy. - Yeah, but I'm also one\nletter away from Feinstein. - Well, you get to pick. Okay, so, unified theory. You know, you've worked, you\nenjoy the beauty of geometry. Well, I don't actually\nknow if you enjoy it. You certainly are quite good at it-- - I tremble before it.\n- Tremble before it. If you're religious that is one of the-- - I don't have to be religious. It's just so beautiful,\nyou will tremble anyway. - I just read Einstein's\nbiography and one of the ways, one of the things you've\ndone is try to explore a unified theory talking about\na 14 dimensional observerse that has the 4D space time\ncontinuum embedded in it. I'm just curious how you think, philosophically at a high level, about something more than four dimensions. How do you try to, what does\nit make you feel talking in the mathematical world about dimensions that are greater than\nthe ones we can perceive? Is there something that you take away that's more than just the math? - Well, first of all, stick\nout your tongue at me. Okay, now.\n(Lex chuckling) On the front of that tongue.\n- Yeah? - There was a sweet receptor. And next to that were salt\nreceptors on two different sides. A little bit farther back\nthere were sour receptors, and you wouldn't show me the back of your tongue where\nyour bitter receptor was. - [Lex] I show the good side always. - Okay, but that was four\ndimensions of taste receptors. But you also had pain\nreceptors on that tongue and probably heat\nreceptors on that tongue. So let's assume that you have one of each. That would be six dimensions. So when you eat something,\nyou eat a slice of pizza and it's got some hot pepper\non it, maybe some jalapeno. You're having a six\ndimensional experience, dude. - Do you think we over\nemphasize the value of time as one of the dimensions or space? Well, we certainly over\nemphasize the value of time 'cause we things to start and end, or we really don't like things\nto end, but they seem to. - Well, what if you flipped\none of the spacial dimensions into being a temporal dimension? And you and I were to meet\nin New York City and say, well where and when should we meet? And I say, how about I'll\nmeet you on 36th and Lexington at 2:00 in the afternoon and\n11 o'clock in the morning? That would be very confusing. - Well, it's so convenient for us to think about time, you mean? - We happen to be in a\ndelicious situation in which we have three dimensions\nof space and one of time, and they're woven together in\nthis sort of strange fabric where we can trade off a\nlittle space for a little time. But we still only have one dimension that is picked out relative\nto the other three. It's very much Gladys Knight and the Pips. - So, which one developed for who? Did we develop for these dimensions? Or did the dimensions, or were they always there and it doesn't-- - Well, do you imagine\nthat there isn't a place where there are four temporal dimensions? Or two and two of space and time? Or three of time and one of space? And then would time not be\nplaying the role of space? Why do you imagine that the sector that you're in is all that there is? - I certainly do not, but\nI can't imagine otherwise. I mean, I haven't done\nayahuasca or any of those drugs. I hope to one day, but-- - Instead of doing ayahuasca, you could just head over to Building Two. - That's where the mathematicians are? - [Eric] Yeah, that's where they hang. - [Lex] Just to look at some geometry? - Well just ask about\npseudo-Riemannian geometry, that's what you're interested in. (Lex chuckling)\n- [Lex] Okay. - Or you can talk to a\nshaman and end up in Peru. - And then some extra\nmoney for that trip-- - Yeah, but you won't be\nable to do any calculations if that's how you choose to go about it. - Well, a different kind of calculation-- - So to speak.\n- Yeah. One of my favorite people, Edward Franco, Berkeley professor,\nauthor of Love and Math, great title for a book,\nsaid that you were quite a remarkable intellect to\ncome up with such beautiful, original ideas in terms of\nunified theory and so on. But you were working outside academia. So, one question in developing ideas that are truly original,\ntruly interesting, what's the difference between\ninside academia and outside academia when it comes\nto developing such ideas? - Oh, it's a terrible\nchoice, a terrible choice. So, if you do it inside of academics, you are forced to constantly... show great loyalty to the consensus and you distinguish yourself with small, almost microscopic heresies to make your reputation in general. And you have very competent\npeople and brilliant people who are working together who formed\nvery deep social networks, and have a very high level of behavior, at least within mathematics\nand at least technically within physics, theoretical physics. When you go outside, you meet\nlunatics and crazy people. Madmen and these are people\nwho do not usually subscribe to the consensus position and\nalmost always lose their way. And the key question is will\nprogress likely come from someone who is miraculously\nmanaged to stay within the system and is able to\ntake on a larger amount of heresy, that is sort of unthinkable? In which case, that will be fascinating. Or, is it more likely that\nsomebody will maintain a level of discipline from outside of\nacademics and be able to make use of the freedom that comes\nfrom not having to constantly affirm your loyalty to the\nconsensus of your field. - So you've characterized\nin ways that academia, in this particular sense is declining. You posted the plot, the older population of the faculty is getting larger. The younger is getting smaller and so on. So, which direction of the two\nare you more hopeful about? - Well, the Baby Boomers\ncan't hang on forever. - Which is first of all in general true, and second of all in academia-- - But that's really what\nthis time is about-- - Is the Baby Boomers control.\n- Is we didn't, we're used to like financial bubbles\nthat last a few years in length and then pop. - Yes.\n- The Baby Boomer bubble is this really long lived\nthing and all of the ideology, all of the behavior patterns,\nthe norms, you know, for example string theory is an almost entirely Baby Boomer phenomena. It was something that Baby\nBoomers were able to do because it required a very high level\nof mathematical ability. - You don't think of string\ntheory as an original idea? - Oh, I mean it was original to Veneziano who probably is older\nthan the Baby Boomers and there are people who are younger than the Baby Boomers who are\nstill doing string theory. And I'm not saying that\nnothing discovered within the large string theoretic\ncomplex is wrong. Quite the contrary. A lot of brilliant mathematics\nand a lot of the structure of physics was elucidated\nby string theorists. What do I think of the deliverable nature of this product that will not\nship called string theory? I think that is largely an\naffirmative action program for highly mathematically\nand geometrically talented Baby Boomer\nphysicists so that they can say that they're\nworking on something within the constraints of what they\nwill say is quantum gravity. Now there are other schemes. You know, there's like asymptotic safety. There are other things that\nyou could imagine doing. I don't think much of any\nof the major programs, but to have inflicted this\nlevel of loyalty through a shibboleth, well surely\nyou don't question x. Well, I question almost\neverything in the string program, and that's why I got out of physics. When you called me\nphysicist, was a great honor, but the reason I didn't become a physicist wasn't that I fell in\nlove with mathematics. As I said, wow, in 1984, 1983,\nI saw the field going mad, and I saw that mathematics,\nwhich has all sorts of problems, was not going insane. And so instead of studying\nthings within physics, I thought it was much safer to study the same objects within mathematics. And there's a huge price to pay for that. You lose physical intuition. But the point is, is that it wasn't a North Korean reeducation camp, either. - Are you hopeful about cracking open the Einstein Unified\nTheory in a way that has, in really understanding\nwhether uniting everything together with quantum theory and so on? - I mean, I'm trying to\nplay this role myself. To do it to the extent of\nhanding it over to the more responsible, more professional,\nmore competent community. So, I think that they're\nwrong about a great number of their belief structures,\nbut I do believe, I mean I have a really\nprofound love hate relationship with this group of people. - On the physics side?\n- Oh yeah. - 'Cause the mathematicians actually seem to be much more open minded and-- - Well, they are and they aren't. They're open minded about anything that looks like great math. - Right.\n- Right, they'll study something that isn't\nvery important physics, but if it's beautiful\nmathematics then they'll have, they have great intuition\nabout these things. As good as the mathematicians are, and I might even intellectually at some horsepower level\ngive them the edge. The theoretical physics\ncommunity is bar none, the most profound intellectual community that we have ever created. It is the number one, there\nis nobody in second place as far as I'm concerned. Like, in their spare time,\nin the spare time they invented molecular biology. - What was the origin\nof molecular biology? You're saying physicists-- - Well somebody like Francis Crick. A lot of the early molecular biologists-- - Were physicists?\n- Yeah, I mean you know, Schrodinger wrote What is Life and that was highly inspirational. I mean, you have to appreciate\nthat there is no community like the basic research\ncommunity in theoretical physics. And it's not something, I'm\nhighly critical of these guys. I think that they would just\nwasted the decades of time with and your religious devotion\nto their misconceptualization of where the problems were in physics. But this has been the\ngreatest intellectual collapse ever witnessed within academics. - You see it as a collapse or just a lull? - Oh, I'm terrified that we're\nabout to lose the vitality. We can't afford to pay these people. We can't afford to give them\nan accelerator just to play with in case they find something\nat the next energy level. These people created our economy. They gave us the RAD Lab and radar. They gave us two atomic\ndevices to end World War II. They created the semi-conductor\nand the transistor to power our economy through Moore's law. As a positive externality\nof particle accelerators, they created the World Wide Web and we have the insolence to say, why should we fund you\nwith our taxpayer dollars? No, the question is, are you\nenjoying your physics dollars? Right, these guys signed the world's worst licensing agreement. - Right.\n- And, if they simply charged for every time you used a\ntransistor or a URL or enjoyed the peace that they have\nprovided during this period of time through the terrible\nweapons that they developed, or your communications devices. All of the things that power our economy, I really think came out of physics, even to the extent that\nchemistry came out of physics, and molecular biology came out of physics. So, first of all you have to know that I'm very critical of this community. Second of all, it is our\nmost important community. We have neglected it, we've abused it, we don't take it seriously,\nwe don't even care to get them to rehab after a couple\nof generations of failure. Right, no one, I mean I\nthink the youngest person to have really contributed\nto the standard model at a theoretical level\nwas born in 1951, right? Frank Wilczek. And almost nothing has happened\nthat in theoretical physics after 1973, '74, that\nsent somebody to Stockholm for theoretical development\nthat predicted experiment. So, we have to understand that we are doing this to ourselves. Now, with that said, these\nguys have behaved abysmally, in my opinion, because\nthey haven't owned up to where they actually are, what problems they're really facing, how definite they can actually be. They haven't shared some of their most brilliant discoveries,\nwhich are desperately needed in other fields like gauge theory, which at least the\nmathematicians can share, which is an upgrade of\nthe differential calculus of Newton and Leibniz, and they haven't shared the importance of renormalization theory,\neven though this should be standard operating\nprocedure for people across the sciences dealing with different layers and different levels of phenomena, so-- - And by shared you mean\ncommunicated in such a way that it disseminates throughout\nthe different sciences? - These guys are sitting,\nboth theoretical physicists and mathematicians are sitting on top of a giant stockpile of\nintellectual gold, right? They have so many things that have not been manifested anywhere. I was just on Twitter I think I mentioned the Hoberman switch pitch that shows the self\nduality of the tetrahedron realizes that it linkage mechanism. Now this is like a triviality and it makes an amazing toy that's, you know, built a market.\n- Yeah. - Hopefully a fortune for Chuck Hoberman. Well, you have no idea\nhow much great stuff that these priests have\nin their monastery. - So, it's a truly a love and\nhate relationship for you? It sounds like it's\nmore on the love side-- - [Eric] This building\nthat we're in right here. - Yes. - Is the building in which\nI really put together the conspiracy between the\nNational Academy of Sciences and the National Science\nFoundation through the Government University\nIndustry Research round table to destroy the bargaining\npower of American academics using foreign labor. On microfiche in the base.\n- Post docs and so on? - Oh yeah, that was done\nhere in this building. Isn't that weird? - I'm truly speaking with a\nrevolutionary and a radical-- - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. At an intellectual level, I\nam absolutely garden variety. I'm just straight down the middle. The system that we are in. This University is functionally insane. - [Lex] Yeah. - Harvard is functionally\ninsane and we don't understand that when we\nget these things wrong, the financial crisis made this very clear. There was a long period\nwhere every grownup, everybody with a tie who\nspoke in baritone tones with a right degree at\nthe end of their name. - Yeah.\n- Were talking about how we banished volatility, we\nwere in the great moderation. Okay, they were all crazy. And who was right? It was like Nassim Taleb. - Right.\n- Nouriel Roubini. Now, what happens is is that they claimed the market went crazy. But the market didn't go crazy. The market had been crazy\nand what happened is is that it suddenly went sane. Well that's where we are with academics. Academics right now is mad as a hatter and it's absolutely evident. I can show you graph after graph. I can show you the internal discussions. I can show you the conspiracies. Harvard's dealing with one\nright now over its admissions policies for people of color\nwho happen to come from Asia. All of this madness is necessary\nto keep the game going. What we're talking about,\njust while we're on the topic of revolutionaries,\nis we're talking about the danger of an outbreak of sanity. - Yeah, you're the guy pointing out the elephant in the room here and-- - The elephant has no clothes. - Is that how that goes? I was gonna talk a little\nbit to Joe Rogan about this, ran out of time, but\nI think you have some, just listening to you, you\ncan probably speak really eloquently to academia on the difference between the different fields. So, do you think there's a\ndifference between science, engineering and then the\nhumanities in academia, in terms of tolerance, that\nthey're willing to tolerate? So, from my perspective I\nthought computer science and maybe engineering is more\ntolerant to radical ideas, but that's perhaps innocent of me. 'Cause I always, you know\nall the battles going on now are a little bit\nmore of the humanities side and gender studies and so on. - Have you seen the American\nMathematical Society's publication of an essay\ncalled Get out the Way. - I have not, what's the--\n- The idea is that white men who hold positions within\nUniversities in mathematics should vacate their positions\nso that young black women can take over or something like this. - That's in terms of diversity, which I also wanted to ask you about, but in terms of diversity\nof strictly ideas. - Oh, sure.\n- Do you think, 'cause you're basically\nsaying physics as a community, has become a little bit\nintolerant to some degree, to new radical ideas or\nat least you said that-- - But it's changed a little bit recently. Which is that even string\ntheory is now admitting, okay, this doesn't look very\npromising in the short term. Right, so the question is what compiles, if you wanna take the\ncomputer science metaphor. What will get you into a journal? Will you spend your life\ntrying to push some paper into a journal or will\nit be accepted easily? What do we know about the\ncharacteristics of the submitter and what gets taken up and what does not? All of these fields are\nexperiencing pressure because no field is performing so\nbrilliantly well that it's revolutionizing our way\nof speaking and thinking, in the ways in which we\nhave become accustomed. - But don't you think, even\nin theoretical physics, a lot of times, even with\ntheories like string theory, you could speak to this,\nit does eventually lead to what are the ways that this\ntheory would be testable? - Yeah, ultimately, although look, there's this thing about Popper and the scientific method that's a cancer and a disease in the minds\nof very smart people. That's not really how most\nof the stuff gets worked out, it's how it gets checked. - Right, so--\n- And there is a dialog between theory and experiment. But, everybody should\nread Paul Dirac's 1963 Scientific American article where he, you know, it's very interesting. He talks about it as if it was about the Schrodinger equation\nand Schrodinger's failure to advance his own work\nbecause of his failure to account for some phenomena. The key point is that if your\ntheory is a slight bit off, it won't agree with experiment, but it doesn't mean that the\ntheory is actually wrong. But Dirac could as easily have\nbeen talking about his own equation in which he predicted that the electrons should\nhave an anti-particle. And since the only positively\ncharged particle that was known at the time was the\nproton, Heisenberg pointed out, well shouldn't your\nanti-particle, the proton, have the same mass as the electron and doesn't that invalidate your theory? So, I think that Dirac was actually being, potentially quite sneaky\nin talking about the fact that he had been pushed\noff of his own theory, to some extent, by Heisenberg. But look, we fetishize\nthe scientific method and Popper and falsification\nbecause it protects us from crazy ideas entering the field. So, you know, it's a question\nof balancing type one and type two error and we were pretty\nmaxed out in one direction. - The opposite of that. Let me say what comforts me. Sort of biology or engineering\nat the end of the day, does the thing work?\n- Yeah. - You can test the crazies away. Well see now, you're saying\nbut some ideas are truly crazy and some are actually correct, so. - Well there's pre-correct\ncurrently crazy. - Yeah.\n- Right? And so you don't wanna\nget rid of everybody who's pre-correct and currently crazy. The problem is is that we don't\nhave standards in general, for trying to determine who has to be put to the sword in terms of their career and who has to be protected\nas some sort of giant time suck pain in the ass who\nmay change everything. - Do you think that's possible? Creating a mechanism of those selective-- - Well, you're not gonna like\nthe answer, but here it comes. - [Lex] Oh, boy. - It has to do with very human elements. We're trying to do this\nat the level of like rules and fairness, it's not gonna work. 'Cause the only thing that\nreally understands this, you ever read The Double Helix? - It's a book? - Oh, you have to read this book-- - Oh, boy.\n- Not only did Jim Watson half discover this three\ndimensional structure of DNA, he was also one hell of a\nwriter before he became an ass. No, he's tried\n- Yes, like he is. - To destroy his own reputation-- - I knew about the ass, I didn't\nknow about the good writer. - Jim Watson is one of the most\nimportant people now living, and as I've said before,\nJim Watson is too important a legacy to be left to Jim Watson. That book tells you more about\nwhat actually moves the dial. I mean, there's another\nstory about him which I don't agree with, which is that he stole everything from Rosalind Franklin. I mean, the problems that he\nhad with Rosalind Franklin are real, but we should\nactually honor that tension in our history by delving into it, rather than having a simple solution. Jim Watson talks about Francis\nCrick being a pain in the ass that everybody secretly\nknew was super brilliant. And there's an encounter between\nChargaff who came up with the equimolar relations\nbetween the nucleotides, who should've gotten the structure of DNA and Watson and Crick, and you know, he talks\nabout missing a shiver in the heartbeat of biology\nand this stuff is so gorgeous, it just makes you tremble\neven thinking about it. Look, we know very often\nwho is to be feared, and we need to fund the\npeople that we fear. The people who are wasting our time need to be excluded from the conversation. You see, and you know,\nmaybe we'll make some errors in both directions, but we\nhave known our own people. We know the pains in the\nasses that might work out, and we know the people who\nare really just blowhards who really have very little to\ncontribute most of the time. It's not 100%, but you're not\ngonna get there with rules. - Right, it's using some kind of instinct. I mean, to be honest, I'm\ngonna make you roll your eyes for a second, but in the\nfirst time I heard that there was large community of people\nwho believe the earth is flat, actually made me pause and\nask myself the question-- - Why would there be such a community? - Yeah, is it possible the earth is flat? So I had to like, wait a minute. I mean, then you go\nthrough a thinking process that I think is really healthy. It ultimately ends up being\na geometry thing I think. It's an interesting thought\nexperiment at the very least. - Well, see I don't, I do\na different version of it. I say, why is this community stable? - Yeah, that's a good way to analyze it. - Interesting that whatever we've done has not erased the community. So, you know, they're\ntaking a long shot bet that won't pan out, you know? Maybe we just haven't thought enough about the rationality of the square root of two and somebody brilliant will figure it out. Maybe we will eventually land one day on the surface of Jupiter and explore it. Right, these are crazy things\nthat will never happen. - So, much of social media\noperates by AI algorithms, we talked this a little bit, recommending the content you see. So, on this idea of radical\nthought, how much should AI show you things you disagree\nwith on Twitter and so on? In the Twitterverse in the-- - I hate this question. - Yeah?\n- Yeah. - 'Cause you don't know the answer? - No, no, no, no. Look, they've pushed\nout this cognitive Lego to us that will just lead to madness. It's good to be challenged with things that you disagree with. You answer is, no. It's gonna to be challenged\nwith interesting things with which you currently disagree,\nbut that might be true. I don't really care about\nwhether or not I disagree with something or don't\ndisagree, I need to know why that particular disagreeable\nthing is being pushed out. Is it because it's likely to be true? Is it because, is there some reason? Because I write a computer\ngenerator to come up with an infinite number\nof disagreeable statements that nobody needs to look at. So, please before you push things at me that are disagreeable, tell me why. - There is an aspect in which\nthat question is quite dumb, especially because it's\nbeing used to almost very generically by these\ndifferent networks to say, well we're trying to work this out, but you know, basically how much, do you see the value of\nseeing things you don't like? Not you disagree with, because\nit's very difficult to know exactly what you articulated,\nwhich is the stuff that's important for you to consider\nthat you disagree with. That's really hard to figure out. The bottom line is the\nstuff you don't like. If you're a Hillary Clinton supporter, it might not make you feel good to see anything about Donald Trump. That's the only thing algorithms can really optimize for currently. They really can't--\n- No, they can do better. - You think so?\n- No, we're engaged in some moronic back and forth where\nI have no idea why people who are capable of building Google, Facebook, Twitter are having us in these incredibly low level discussions. Do they not know any smart people? Do they not have the phone numbers of people who can elevate\nthese discussions? - They do, but this-- - Please, no, no, no.\n- They're optimizing for a different thing and they are pushing those people out of those rooms. - No, they're optimizing\nfor things we can't see, and yes, profit is there. Nobody's questioning that. But they're also optimizing\nfor things like political control or the fact that\nthey're doing business in Pakistan and so they don't\nwanna talk about all the things that they're going\nto bending to in Pakistan. So, we're involved in a fake discussion. - You think so, you\nthink these conversations at that depth are happening inside Google? You don't think they have some basic metrics under user engagements? - You're having a fake\nconversation with us, guys. We know you're having a fake conversation. I do not wish to be part\nof your fake conversation. You know how to cool these units. You know high availability\nlike nobody's business. My Gmail never goes down, almost. - So you think just because\nthey can do incredible work on the software side with infrastructure, they can also deal with some\nof these difficult questions about human behavior, human understanding, you're not, (chuckling). - I mean, I've seen\nthe developer's screens that people take shots\nof inside of Google. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I've heard stories\ninside of Facebook and Apple. We're not, we're engaged, they're engaging us in the wrong conversations. We are not at this low level. Here's one of my favorite questions. - Yeah.\n- Why is every piece of hardware that I purchase in text base equipped as a listening device? Where's my physical\nshutter to cover my lens? We had this in the 1970s. They had cameras that\nhad lens caps, you know? How much would it cost\nto have a security model? Pay five extra bucks. Why is my indicator light\nsoftware controlled? Why when my camera is on, do\nI not see that the light is on by putting it as something\nthat cannot be bypassed? Why have you setup all of my devices, at some difficulty to yourselves, as listening devices and we\ndon't even talk about this. This thing is total fucking bullshit. - Well, I hope, so.\n- Wait, wait, wait. - These discussions are\nhappening about privacy, 'cause they're more difficult\nthan you give 'em credit for-- - It's not just privacy.\n- Yeah? - It's about social control. We're talking about social control. Why do I not have controls\nover my own levers? Just have a really cute\nUI, where I can switch, I can dial things or I can at least see what the algorithms are. - You think that there are some deliberate choices being made here-- - There's emergence\nand there is intention. There are two dimensions. The vector does not\ncollapse onto either axis. But the idea that anybody who suggests that intention is completely\nabsent is a child. - That's really beautifully\nput and like many things you've said is gonna make me-- - Can I turn this around slightly though? - Yeah.\n- I sit down with you and you say that you're\nobsessed with my feed. - Uh huh.\n- I don't even know what my feed is, what are\nyou seeing that I'm not? - I was obsessively looking\nthrough your feed on Twitter, 'cause it was really\nenjoyable because there's the Tom Lehrer element,\nthere's the humor in it. - By the way that feed is\nericrweinstein on Twitter. - That's great.\n- @ericrweinstein. - Yeah.\n- No, but seriously, why? - Why did I find it enjoyable\nor what was I seeing? - What are you looking for? Why are we doing this? What is this podcast about? I know you got all these\ninteresting people. I'm just some guy who is\nsort of a podcast guest. - Sort of a podcast, you're\nnot even wearing a tie. I mean,\n- I'm not even wearing a tie. - It's not even a serious interview. I was searching for\nmeaning, for happiness, for a dopamine rush, so\nshort term and long term. - And how are you finding your way to me? What is, I don't honestly know\nwhat I'm doing to reach you. - The representing ideas\nwhich field common sense to me and not many people are speaking. So it's kinda like, the\nIntellectual Dark Web folks, right? These folks, from Sam\nHarris to Jordan Peterson, to yourself, are saying\nthings where it's like, you're like saying,\nlook there's an elephant and he's not wearing any\nclothes and I say, yeah, yeah, let's have more of that conversation. That's how I'm finding you. - I'm desperate to try to change the conversation we're having. I'm very worried we've\ngot an election in 2020. I don't think we can\nafford four more years of a misinterpreted message,\nwhich is what Donald Trump was, and I don't want the\ndestruction of our institutions. They all seem hellbent\non destroying themselves. So, I'm trying to save\ntheoretical physics, trying to save the New York Times, trying to save our various\nprocesses and I think it feels delusional to me that this\nis falling to a tiny group of people who are willing\nto speak out without getting so freaked out that everything they say will be misinterpreted\nand that their lives will be ruined through the process. I mean, I think we're in an\nabsolutely bananas period of time and I don't believe\nit should fall to such a tiny number of shoulders\nto shoulder this weight. - So, I have to ask you\non a capitalism side, you mentioned that technology\nis killing capitalism or has effects that are,\nwell not unintended, but not what economists would predict or speak of capitalism creating. I just wanna talk to you about in general, the effect of even then,\nartificial intelligence or technology automation taking\naway jobs and these kinds of things and what you think\nis the way to alleviate that. Whether the Andrew Ang\npresidential candidate with universal basic income, UBI,\nwhat are your thoughts there? How do we fight off the negative effects of technology that-- - All right, you're a software guy, right? - Yep. - A human being is a\nworker, is an old idea. - Yes.\n- A human being has a worker is a different object, right?\n- Yes. - So if you think about\nobject oriented programming as a paradigm, a human being has a worker and a human being has a soul. We're talking about the fact\nthat for a period of time, the worker that a human being has, was in a position to feed the\nsoul that a human being has. However, we have two separate claims on the value in society. One is as a worker and\nthe other is as a soul, and the soul needs\nsustenance, it needs dignity, it needs meaning, it needs purpose. As long as you're means of\nsupport is not highly repetitive, I think you have a while to go before you need to start worrying. But if what you do is highly repetitive and it's not terrible generative,\nyou are in the crosshairs of for loops and while loops and that's what computers accel at;\nrepetitive behavior and when I say repetitive I may mean things\nthat have never happened through combinatorial possibilities, but as long as it has a\nlooped characteristic to it, you're in trouble. We are seeing a massive\npush towards socialism because capitalists are slow to address the fact that a worker may\nnot be able to make claims. A relatively undistinguished\nmedian member of our society still has needs to\nreproduce, needs to dignity and when capitalism abandons\nthe median individual or the bottom tenth or\nwhatever it's going to do, it's flirting with revolution\nand what concerns me is that the capitalists\naren't sufficiently capitalistic to understand this. You really want to court\nauthoritarian control in our society because you\ncan't see that people may not be able to defend themselves\nin the marketplace because the marginal\nproduct of their labor is too low to feed\ntheir dignity as a soul? So, my great concern is\nthat our free society has to do with the fact\nthat we are self organized. I remember looking down\nfrom my office in Manhattan when Lehman Brothers\ncollapsed and thinking, who's gonna tell all these\npeople that they need to show up at work when they\ndon't have a financial system to incentivize them to show up at work? So, my complaint is first of\nall, not with the socialists, but with the capitalists, which is you guys are being idiots. You're courting revolution by\ncontinuing to harp on the same old ideas that well, try\nharder, bootstrap yourself. Yeah, to an extent that\nworks, to an extent. But we are clearly headed in\na place that there's nothing that ties together our need\nto contribute and our need to consume and that may not\nbe provided by capitalism, because it may have been\na temporary phenomena. So, check out my article\non anthropic capitalism and the new gimmick economy. I think people are late\ngetting the wake up call, and we would be doing a\nbetter job saving capitalism from itself because I don't want this done under authoritarian control,\nand the more we insist that everybody who's not thriving\nin our society during their reproductive years in\norder to have a family, is failing at a personal level. I mean, what a disgusting\nthing that we're saying. What a horrible message. Who the hell have we\nbecome that we've so bought in to the Chicago model that\nwe can't see the humanity that we're destroying in that process and I hate the thought of\ncommunism, I really do. My family has flirted\nwith it decades past, it's a wrong, bad idea, but\nwe are going to need to figure out how to make sure that\nthose souls are nourished and respected and capitalism\nbetter have an answer. And I'm betting on capitalism,\nbut I gotta tell ya, I'm pretty disappointed with my team. - So you're still on the capitalism team, just there's a theme here-- - [Eric] Well, radical capitalism. - Right, hyper capitalism, yeah. - Look, I want, I think\nhyper capitalism is gonna have to be coupled to hyper socialism. You need to allow the\nmost productive people to create wonders and you\ngotta stop bogging them down with all of these extra nice requirements. You know, nice is dead. Good has a future. Nice doesn't have a future\nbecause nice ends up with gulags. - Damn, that's a good line. Okay, last question. You Tweeted today, a simple,\nquite insightful equation saying \"Imagine that every\nunit f of fame you picked up, \"s stalkers and h haters\". So, I imagine s and h are dependent on your path to fame,\nperhaps a little bit-- - Well, it's not a simple. I mean, people always take\nthese things literally when you have like 280\ncharacters to explain yourself. - So you mean that's not a mathematical-- - No, there's no law.\n- Oh, okay, all right. - I just, I put the word\nimagine because I still have a mathematicians\ndesire for precision. - Yes.\n- Imagine that this were true. - But there was a beautiful way to imagine that there is a law that\nhas those variables in it-- - [Eric] Yeah, yeah. - And you've become\nquite famous these days, so how do you yourself\noptimize that equation with the peculiar kind of fame that\nyou've gathered along the way? - I wanna be kinder. I wanna be kinder to myself,\nI wanna kinder to others, I wanna be able to have heart, compassion and these things\nare really important, and I have a pretty spectrumy\nkind of approach to analysis. I'm quite literal. I can go full Rain Man on\nyou at any given moment. No, I can, I can. It's facultative autism, if you like, and people are gonna get angry because they want autism\nto be respected, but. When you see me coding or\nyou see me doing mathematics, you know, I speak with\nspeech apnea, (stutters), be right down for dinner, you know? - [Lex] Yeah. - We have to try to integrate ourselves in those tensions between, you know, it's sort of back to us as\na worker and us as a soul. Many of us are optimizing one\nat the expense of the other. And I struggle with social\nmedia and I struggle with people making threats against our\nfamilies and I struggle with just how much pain people are in. And if there's one message I\nwould like to push out there, you're responsible, everybody, all of us, myself included, with struggling. Struggle mightily because it's nobody else's job to do your struggle for you. Now with that said, if you're\nstruggling and you're trying, and you're trying to figure\nout how to better yourself and where you've failed, where\nyou've let down your family, your friends, your workers,\nall this kind of stuff, give yourself a break, you know? If it's not working out, I\nhave a lifelong relationship with failure and success. There's been no period\nof my life where both haven't been present\nin one form or another. And, I do wish to say that a lot of the times people\nthink this is glamorous. I'm about to go, you know,\ndo a show with Sam Harris. - Yeah.\n- People are gonna listen in on two guys having a\nconversation on stage. It's completely crazy when I'm\nalways trying to figure out how to make sure that those\npeople get maximum value and that's why I'm doing this podcast, you know, just give yourself a break. You owe us your struggle. You don't owe your\nfamily or your coworkers or your lovers or your\nfamily members success. As long as you're in there and\nyou're picking yourself up, recognize that this new\nsituation with the economy that doesn't have the juice\nto sustain our institutions, has caused the people\nwho've risen to the top of those institutions to\nget quite brutal and cruel. Everybody is lying at the moment. Nobody is really truth teller. Try to keep your humanity about you. Try to recognize that if you're failing, if things aren't where you\nwant them to be and you're struggling and you're trying to figure out what you're doing wrong,\nwhat you could do, it's not necessarily all your fault. We are in a global situation. I have not met the people who are honest, kind, good, successful. Nobody that I've met is\nchecking all the boxes. Nobody's getting all 10s. So, I just think that's\nan important message that doesn't get pushed out enough. Either people wanna\nhold society responsible for their failures,\nwhich is not reasonable. You have to struggle, you have to try. Or they wanna say you're 100%\nresponsible for your failures, which is total nonsense. - Beautifully put. Eric, thank you so much for talking today. - Thanks for having me, buddy."

  "full_text": "- The following is a\nconversation with Eric Weinstein. He's a mathematician, economist, physicist and the managing\ndirector of Thiel Capital. He coined the term and you could say, is the founder of the\nIntellectual Dark Web, which is a loosely assembled\ngroup of public intellectuals that includes Sam Harris,\nJordan Peterson, Steven Pinker, Joe Rogan, Michael\nShermer and a few others. This conversation is part of\nthe artificial intelligence podcast at MIT and Beyond. If you enjoy it, subscribe\non YouTube, iTunes, or simply connect with me\non Twitter @lexfridman, spelled F-R-I-D. And now, here's my conversation\nwith Eric Weinstein. - Are you nervous about this? - Scared shitless. - Okay, (speaking foreign language). - You mention Kung Fu Panda as\none of your favorite movies. It has the usual profound\nmaster student dynamic going on, so who has been a teacher\nthat significantly influenced the direction of your\nthinking and life's work? So, if you're the Kung Fu\nPanda, who was your Shifu? - Oh, well that's interesting, because I didn't see Shifu\nas being the teacher. - Who was the teacher? - Oogway, Master Oogway, the turtle. - Oh, the turtle, right. - They only meet twice in the entire film and the first conversation\nsort of doesn't count. So, they magic of the\nfilm, in fact, it's point is that the teaching that\nreally matters is transferred during a single conversation\nand it's very brief. And so, who played that role in my life? I would say either my\ngrandfather, Harry Rubin and his wife Sophie Rubin,\nmy grandmother or Tom Lehrer. - Tom Lehrer?\n- Yeah. - In which way? - If you give a child Tom Lehrer records, what you do is you destroy their ability to be taken over by later malware, and it's so irreverent, so\nwitty, so clever, so obscene, that it destroys the ability to lead a normal life for many people. So if I meet somebody who's\nusually really shifted from any kind of neuro\ntypical presentation, I'll often ask them,\nare you a Tom Lehrer fan and the odds that they will\nrespond are quite high. - Now Tom Lehrer is Poisoning\nPigeons in the Park, Tom Lehrer?\n- That's very interesting. There are a small number\nof Tom Lehrer songs that broke into the general population. Poisoning Pigeons in the Park, the Element Song and\nperhaps the Vatican Rag. So, when you meet somebody\nwho knows those songs, but doesn't know-- - Oh, you're judging me\nright now, aren't you? - Harshly.\n- Okay. - No, but you're Russian, so.\n- Yes. - Undoubtedly you know\nNikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky. That song.\n- Yes, yeah, yup. - So that was a song about plagiarism that was in fact plagiarized, which most people don't\nknow, from Danny Kaye. Where Danny Kaye did a song called Stanislavsky of the musky arts. And, so Tom Lehrer did this brilliant job of plagiarizing a song and\nmaking it about plagiarism, and then making it about\nthis mathematician, who worked in Non-Euclidean geometry. That was like giving heroin to a child. It was extremely addictive and eventually led me to a lot of different places. One of which may have\nbeen PhD in mathematics. - And he was also at least\na lecturer in mathematics, I believe at Harvard, something like that? - Yeah, I just had\ndinner with him, in fact. When my son turned 13, we didn't tell him, but his Bar mitzvah present was dinner with his hero, Tom Lehrer, and Tom Lehrer was 88\nyears old, sharp as a tack, irreverent and funny as\nhell and just, you know, there are very few people in this world that you have to meet\nwhile they're still here and that was definitely\none for our family. - So that wit is a\nreflection of intelligence in some kind of deep way. Like where that would be a good test of intelligence whether\nyou're a Tom Lehrer fan. So, what do you think that is about wit? About that kind of humor, ability to see the absurdity in existence? Do you think that's connected\nto intelligence or are we just two Jews on a mic that\nappreciate that kind of humor. - No, I think that it's absolutely connected to intelligence. You can see it, there's a\nplace where Tom Lehrer decides that he's going to lampoon\nGilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan and he's going to out\ndue Gilbert with clever, meaningless wordplay and he has, I forget the, well let's see. He's doing Clementine as if\nGilbert and Sullivan wrote it and he says that I missed her, depressed her young sister named Esther. This mister to pester she'd tried. A pestering sister's a festering blister you're best to resist her, say I! The sister persisted, the mister resisted, I kissed her, all loyalty slipped. When she said I could have\nher her sister's cadaver must surely have turned in its crypt. That's so dense. It's so insane.\n- Yeah. - That that's clearly intelligence because it's hard to construct\nsomething like that. If I look at my favorite\nTom Lehrer lyric, you know, there's a perfectly absurd one which is, once all the German's\nwere warlike and mean, but that couldn't happen again. We taught them a lesson in 1918 and they've hardly bothered us since then. - Right.\n- That is a different kind of intelligence. You know, you're taking\nsomething that is so horrific and you're sort of making\nit palatable and funny, and demonstrating also just your humanity. I mean, I think the thing that\ncame through as Tom Lehrer wrote all of these\nterrible, horrible lines, was just what a sensitive\nand beautiful soul he was, who was channeling pain through\nhumor and through grace. - I've seen throughout\nEurope, throughout Russia, the same kind of humor emerged from the generation of World War II. It seemed like that humor\nis required to somehow deal with the pain and the suffering\nof that that war created. - Well, you do need the environment to create the broad Slavic soul. I don't think that many\nAmericans really appreciate Russian humor, how you had\nto joke during the time of let's say, Article 58 under Stalin. You had to be very, very careful. You know, the concept of a\nRussian satirical magazine, like Krokodil, doesn't make sense. So you have this cross\ncultural problem that there are certain areas of human\nexperience that it would be better to know nothing\nabout and quite unfortunately, eastern Europe knows a\ngreat deal about them, which makes the songs of\nVladimir Voevodsky so potent. You know, the prose of\nPushkin, whatever it is. You have to appreciate the\ndepth of the Eastern European experience and I would think\nthat perhaps Americans knew something like this around\nthe time of the Civil War or maybe under slavery and Jim Crow or even the harsh tyranny of the coal and steel employers during the labor wars. But in general I would say,\nit's hard for us to understand and imagine the collective culture, unless we have the system\nof selective pressures, that for example, Russians\nwere subjected to. - Yeah, so if there's one good\nthing that comes outta war, it's literature, art and humor and music. - Oh, I don't think so. I\nthink almost everything is good about war except for\ndeath and destruction. - Right. Without the death it would\nbring the romance of it, the whole thing is nice but-- - Well, this is why we're\nalways caught up in war. We have this very ambiguous\nrelationship to it, is that it makes life real\nand pressing and meaningful, and at an unacceptable price and the price has never been higher. - So to jump into AI a little bit, in one of the conversations\nyou had or one of the videos, you described that one of the\nthings AI systems can't do and biological systems\ncan is self replicate in the physical world. - [Eric] Oh, no, no. - In the physical world. - Well, yes. The physical robots can't self replicate, but there's a very tricky point, which is that the only\nthing that we've been able to create that's really\ncomplex that has an analog of our reproductive system is software. - But, nevertheless,\nsoftware replicates itself, if we're speaking strictly\nfor the replication is this kinda digital space. So let me, just to begin,\nlet me ask a question. Do you see a protective barrier or a gap between the physical world\nand the digital world? - Let's not call it digital. Let's call it the logical world\nversus the physical world. - Why logical? - Well, because even though we had, let's say Einstein's brain preserved, it was meaningless to\nus as a physical object because we couldn't do anything with what was stored in it at a logical level. And so, the idea that something\nmay be stored logically and that it may be stored\nphysically, are not necessarily, we don't always benefit from synonymizing. I'm not suggesting that\nthere isn't a material basis to the logical world,\nbut that it does warrant identification with a separate layer that need not invoke logic\ngates and zeros and ones. - And, so connecting those two worlds, the logical world and the\nphysical world or maybe just connecting to the logical\nworld inside our brain, Einstein's brain, you mention\nthe idea of outtelligence. - [Eric] Artificial outtelligence. - Artificial outtelligence.\n- Yes, this is the only essay that John Brockman every\ninvited me to write that he refused to publish in Edge. (Lex chuckling) - Why? - Well, maybe it wasn't well\nwritten, but I don't know. - The idea is quite compelling. It's quite unique and new, at\nleast from my stance point. Maybe you can explain it? - Sure. What I was thinking about is\nwhy it is that we're waiting to be terrified by artificial\ngeneral intelligence. When in fact, artificial\nlife is terrifying in and of itself and it's already here. So, in order to have a system\nof selective pressures, you need three distinct elements. You need variation within a population, you need heritability, and\nyou need differential success. So, what's really unique\nand I've made this point, I think elsewhere, about software, is that if you think about what humans know how to build that's impressive. So, I always take a car\nand I say does it have an analog of each of the\nphysiological systems? Does it have a skeletal\nstructure, that's its frame. Does it have a neurological structure, it has an onboard computer. It has a digestive system. The one thing it doesn't have\nis a reproductive system. But if you can call spawn on a process, effectively you do have\na reproductive system. And that means that you\ncan create something with variation, heritability\nand differential success. Now, the next step in\nthe chain of thinking was where do we see inanimate\nnon intelligent life outwitting intelligent life? And I have two favorite\nsystems and I try to stay on them so that we don't get distracted. One of which is the Ophrys\norchid sub species or sub clave, I don't what to call it. - Is that a type of flower?\n- Yeah, it's a type of flower that mimics the female\nof a pollinator species in order to dupe the males\ninto engaging in what is called pseudocopulation,\nwith the fake female, which is usually represented\nby the lowest pedal, and there's also a pheromone\ncomponent to fool the males into thinking they have\na mating opportunity. But the flower doesn't have\nto give up energy in the form of nectar as a lure, because\nit's tricking the males. The other system is a\nparticular species of muscle, lampsilis in the clear streams\nof Missouri and it fools bass into biting a fleshy lip that\ncontain its young and when the bass see this fleshy\nlip, which looks exactly like a species of fish that\nthe bass like to eat, the young explode and clamp\nonto the gills and parasitize the bass and also use\nthe bass to redistribute them as they eventually release. Both of these systems, you\nhave a highly intelligent dupe, being fooled by a lower life form. And what is sculpting\nthese convincing lures? It's the intelligence of previously duped targets for these strategies. So when the target is smart\nenough to avoid the strategy, those weaker mimics fall off,\nthey have terminal lines, and only the better ones survive. So it's an arms race\nbetween the target species that is being parasitized,\ngetting smarter, and this other less intelligent or non intelligent object\ngetting as if smarter. And so, what you see is,\nis that artificial general intelligence is not\nneeded to parasitize us. It's simply sufficient for\nus to outwit ourselves, so you could have a program, let's say, one of these Nigerian\nscams that writes letters and uses whoever sends it\nBitcoin to figure out which aspects of the program should be kept, which should be varied and thrown away, and you don't need it to\nbe in anyway intelligent in order to have a really\nnightmare scenario being parasitized by something that\nhas no idea what it's doing. - So you phrased a few\nconcepts really eloquently, so let me try to, there's\na few directions this goes. So one, first of all, in the\nway we write software today, it's not common that we\nallow it to self modify. - But we do have that ability now. - We have the ability.\n- It's just not common. - I just isn't common. So your thought is that that is a serious worry if there becomes-- - But self modifying\ncode is available now. - So there's different types\nof self modification right? There's personalization,\nyou know your email app, your Gmail is self modifying\nto you after you login or whatever, you can think of that way. But ultimately it's central,\nall the information is centralized, but you're\nthinking of ideas where you're, this is a unique entity operating under selective pressures and it changes-- - Well, you just, if you\nthink about the fact that our immune systems don't know\nwhat's coming at them next, but they have a small set\nof spanning components, and if it's a sufficiently\nexpressive system in that any shape or binding region can\nbe approximated with the Lego that is present, then\nyou can have confidence that you don't need to\nknow what's coming at you because the combinatorics are sufficient to reach any configuration needed. - So that's a beautiful, well\nterrifying thing to worry about because it's so within our reach. - Whenever I suggest\nthese things I do always have a concern as to whether\nor not I will bring them into being by talking about them. - So there's this thing\nfrom OpenAI next week, to talk to the founder of OpenAI, this idea that their text generation, the new stuff they have\nfor generating text is, they didn't wanna bring it,\nthey didn't wanna release it because they're about the-- - I'm delighted to hear that, but they're going to end up releasing. - Yes, that's the thing is\nI think talking about it, well at least from my end, I'm more a proponent of\ntechnology preventing, so further innovation preventing the detrimental effects of innovation. - Well we're in a, we're\nsort of tumbling down a hill at accelerating speed. So, whether or not we're proponents or-- - It doesn't really matter.\n- It may not matter. - But I.\n- Well, may not. - Well, I do feel that there are people who have held things back and you know, died poorer than they\nmight have otherwise been. We don't even know their names. I don't think that we should\ndiscount the idea that having the smartest people showing\noff how smart they are by what they've developed may\nbe a terminal process. I'm very mindful in particular\nof a beautiful letter that Edward Teller of all\npeople wrote to Leo Szilard where Szilard was trying to\nfigure out how to control the use of atomic weaponry at the\nend of World War II and Teller rather strangely, because many\nof us view him as a monster, showed some very advanced\nmoral thinking talking about the slim chance we have for survival and that the only hope is\nto make war unthinkable. I do think that not enough\nof us feel in our gut, what it is we are playing\nwith when we are working on technical problems, and I\nwould recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it, a movie called\nA Bridge on the River Kwai, about I believe captured British POWs who just in a desire to do a bridge well, end up over collaborating\nwith their Japanese captors. - Well, now you're making me question the unrestricted open\ndiscussion of ideas and AI. - I'm not saying I know the answer, I'm just saying that I\ncould make a decent case for either our need to talk about this and to become technologically\nfocused on containing it or need to stop talking about\nthis and try to hope that the relatively small number\nof highly adept individuals who are looking at these\nproblems is small enough that we should in fact be talking\nabout how to contain it. - Well, the way ideas, the\nway innovation happens, what new ideas develop,\nNewton with calculus. Whether if he was silent, the\nidea would emerge elsewhere, well in case of Newton, of course, but you know, in case of\nAI, how small is this set of individuals out of which\nsuch ideas would arise? Is it in question--\n- Well, the ideas of the researchers we know and\nthose that we don't know. Who may live in countries\nthat don't wish us to know what level they're currently\nat and are very disciplined in keeping these things to themselves. Of course, I will point out that there is a religious school in\nKerala that developed something very close to the calculus,\ncertainly in terms of infinite series in, I guess religious prayer and rhyme and prose. So, you know, it's not\nthat Newton had any ability to hold that back and\nI don't really believe that we have an ability to hold back. I do think that we could change\nthe proportion of the time we spend worrying about\nthe effects of what if we are successful, rather\nthan simply trying to succeed and hope that we'll be able\nto contain things later. - Beautifully put. So, on the idea of\nouttelligence, what form, treading cautiously 'cause we've agreed as we tumbled down the hill. What form--\n- Can't stop ourselves can we? - We cannot. What form do you see it taking? So one example, Facebook,\nGoogle, do want to, I don't know a better\nword, you want to influence users to behave a certain way. And so that's one kind of\nexample of outtelligence, is systems perhaps modifying the behavior of these intelligent human beings in order to sell more product of different kind. But do you see other examples\nof this actually emerging in? - Just take any parasitic\nsystem, you know? Make sure that there's some\nway in which that there's differential success,\nheritability and variation, and those are the magic ingredients. And if you really wanted to\nbuild a nightmare machine, make sure that the system\nthat expresses the variability has a spanning set, so that it\ncan learn to arbitrary levels by making it sufficiently expressive. That's your nightmare. - So, it's your nightmare,\nbut it could also be, it's a really powerful\nmechanism by which to create, well, powerful systems. So, are you more worried\nabout the negative direction that might go versus the positive? So, you said parasitic, but\nthat doesn't necessarily need to be what the\nsystem converges towards. It could be, what is it, symbiotic-- - Well, parasitism, the\ndividing line between parasitism and symbiosis is not so clear. - [Lex] That's what they\ntell me about marriage. I'm still single, so I don't know. - Well, yeah I do. Would could go into that\ntoo, but um. (Lex laughing) No, I think we have to\nappreciate, you know, are you infected by your own mitochondria? - Right. Yeah.\n- Right, so in marriage you fear the loss of independence, but even though the American\ntherapeutic community may be very concerned about co-dependence, what's to say that co-dependence\nisn't what's necessary to have a stable relationship\nin which to raise children who are maximally K-selected and require incredible amounts of care, because you have to wait 13 years before there's any reproductive\npayout and most of us don't want our 13 year olds having kids. That's a very tricky situation to analyze. I would say that predators\nand parasites drive much of our evolution and I don't know whether to be angry at them or thank them. - Well, ultimately, I mean,\nnobody knows the meaning of life or what even happiness is,\nbut there is some metrics-- - Oh, they didn't tell you?\n- They didn't, they didn't. That's why all the poetry\nand books are bought. You know, there are\nsome metrics under which you can kinda measure how good it is that these AI systems are roaming about. So, you're more nervous\nabout software than you are optimistic about ideas\nof self replicating larceny? - I don't think we've\nreally felt where we are. You know, occasionally we get a wake up. 9/11 was so anomalous\ncompared to everything else we've experienced on American\nsoil, that it came to us as a complete shock that\nthat was even a possibility. What it really was, was a\nhighly creative and determined RND team deep in the bowels\nof Afghanistan showing us that we had certain\nexploits that we were open to, that nobody had chosen to express. I can think of several of\nthese things that I don't talk about publicly, that\njust seem to have to do with how relatively unimaginative\nthose who wish to cause havoc and destruction\nhave been up until now. The great mystery of our time, of this particular little era, is how remarkably stable\nwe've been since 1945 when we demonstrated the ability to\nuse nuclear weapons in anger. And, we don't know why things like that haven't happened since then. We've had several close\ncalls, we've had mistakes, we've had brinkmanship and\nwhat's now happened is that we've settled into a sense that\noh, it'll always be nothing. It's been so long since\nsomething was at that level of danger, that we've got\na wrong idea in our head and that's why when I went\non the Ben Shapiro Show, I talked about the need to\nresume above ground testing of nuclear devices because\nwe have people whose developmental experience\nsuggests that when, let's say Donald Trump and\nNorth Korea engage on Twitter, oh it's nothing, it's just\nposturing, everybody's just in it for money, there's\na sense that people are in a video game mode, which has\nbeen the right call since 1945. We've been mostly in video game mode. It's amazing. - So you're worried about a generation which has not seen any existential-- - We've lived under it. See, you're younger. I don't know if, and again,\nyou came from Moscow. - [Lex] From, yeah. - There was a TV show called\nThe Day After that had a huge effect on a generation\ngrowing up in the US, and it talked about what life would be like after a nuclear exchange. We have not gone through\nan embodied experience collectively where we've\nthought about this, and I think it's one of\nthe most irresponsible things that the elders among us have done, which is to provide this beautiful garden in which the thorns are\ncut off of the rosebushes and all of the edges\nare rounded and sanded, and so people have developed\nthis totally unreal idea which is everything is\ngoing to be just fine. And do I think that my\nleading concern is AGI or my leading concern is\nthermonuclear exchange or gene drives or any one of these things? I don't know. But I know that our time here\nin this very long experiment here is finite, because\nthe toys that we've built are so impressive and\nthe wisdom to accompany them has not materialized. And I think we actually got\na wisdom uptick since 1945. We had a lot of dangerous,\nskilled players on the world stage who nevertheless, no\nmatter how bad they were, managed to not embroil us in something that we couldn't come back from. - The Cold War.\n- Yeah, and the distance from the Cold War, you\nknow, I'm very mindful of, there was a Russian tradition, actually, of on your wedding day going to visit a memorial to those who gave their lives. Can you imagine this? Where on the happiest day of your life, you go and you pay homage\nto the people who fought and died in the Battle of Stalingrad? I'm not a huge fan of\ncommunism, I gotta say, but there were a couple of\nthings that the Russians did that were really positive\nin the Soviet era, and I think trying to let people know how serious life actually\nis, is the Russian model of seriousness is better\nthan the American model. - And maybe, like you mentioned, there was a small echo\nof that after 9/11, but-- - We wouldn't let it form. We talk about 9/11, but it's 9/12 that really moved the needle. When we were all just there\nand nobody wanted to speak. We witnessed something super serious and we didn't want to run to our computers and blast out our deep\nthoughts and our feelings. And it was profound because\nwe woke up, briefly, and I talk about the gated\ninstitutional narrative that sort of programs our lives, I've seen it break three times in my life. One of which was the\nelection of Donald Trump, another time was the\nfall of Lehman Brothers, when everybody who knew that\nBear Stearns wasn't that important, knew that Lehman\nBrothers met AIG was next, and the other one was 9/11. And so, if I'm 53 years old\nand I only remember three times that the global narrative\nwas really interrupted, that tells you how much we've been on top of developing events, you know? We had the Murrah Federal\nBuilding explosion, but it didn't cause\nthe narrative to break, it wasn't profound enough. Around 9/12, we started to\nwake up out of our slumber, and the powers that be, did\nnot want a coming together. You know, the admonition was go shopping. - The powers that be,\nso what is that force? As opposed to blaming individuals-- - We don't know.\n- So whatever that-- - Whatever that force is. - In silence.\n- There's a component of it that's emergent and there's a component of it that's deliberate. So, give yourself a portfolio\nwith two components. Some amount of it is\nemergent, but some amount of it is also an understanding\nthat if people come together, they become an incredible force. And what you're seeing\nright now, I think is, there are forces that are\ntrying to come together and there are forces that are\ntrying to push things apart, and you know, one of them\nis the globalist narrative versus the national narrative. Where to the globalist perspective, the nations are bad things in essence. That they're temporary,\nthey're nationalistic, they're jingoistic, it's all negative, to people more in the national\nidiom, they're saying look, this is where I pay my taxes, this is where I do my army service, this is where I have a vote, this is where I have a passport. Who the hell are you to tell\nme that because you've moved into some place that you\ncan make money globally, that you've chosen to abandon other people to whom you have a\nspecial and elevated duty. And I think that these\ncompeting narratives have been pushing towards the global\nperspective from the elite and a larger and larger\nnumber of disenfranchised people are saying, hey, I\nactually live in a place and I have laws and I speak\na language, I have a culture, and who are you to tell me\nthat because you can profit in some far away land, that\nmy obligations to my fellow countrymen are so much diminished. - So these tensions\nbetween nations and so on, ultimately you see being proud\nof your country and so on, which creates potentially the kind of things that led to wars and so on. They ultimately, it is human\nnature and it is good for us, for wake up calls of different kinds. - Well, I think that these are tensions. And my point isn't, I mean nationalism run amuck is a nightmare. And internationalism run\namuck is a nightmare. And the problem is we're\ntrying to push these pendulums to some place where\nthey're somewhat balanced. Where we have a higher duty\nof care to those who share our laws and our citizenship,\nbut we don't forget our duties of care to the global system. I would think this is elementary, but the problem that we're\nfacing concerns the ability for some to profit by abandoning\ntheir obligations to others within their system and that's\nwhat we've had for decades. - You mention nuclear weapons. I was hoping to get answers\nfrom you since one of the many things you've done as economics, maybe you can understand human behavior of why the heck we haven't\nblown each other up yet. But okay, so we'll get-- - I don't know the answer.\n- Yeah. It's really important to say\nthat we really don't know-- - [Eric] A mild uptick in wisdom. - A mild uptick in wisdom,\nSteven Pinker who I've talked with has a lot of really good\nideas about why, but he-- - I don't trust his optimism. (Lex chuckling) - Listen, I'm Russian,\nso I never trust a guy who's that optimistic-- - No, no, no, it's just\nthat you're talking about a guy who's looking at a\nsystem in which more and more of the kinetic energy, like\nwar, has been turned into potential energy like\nunused nuclear weapons. - Wow, beautifully put.\n- And you know now I'm looking at that system and I'm saying, okay, well if you don't have\na potential energy trim, then everything's just\ngetting better and better. - Yeah, yeah, wow, that's beautifully put. Only a physicist could, okay. - [Eric] I'm not a physicist. - Well, is that a dirty word? - [Eric] No, no, I wish\nI were a physicist. - Me too, my dad's a physicist. I'm trying to live up to that probably for the rest of my life. He's probably gonna\nlisten to this too, so. - Hey dad.\n- Yeah, (chuckling). So, your friend, Sam Harris, worries a lot about the\nexistential threat of AI. Not in the way that you've\ndescribed, but in the more. - Well, he hangs out with Elon. I don't know Elon. - So, are you worried about that kind of, you know, about the, about\neither robotics systems or traditionally defined\nAI systems essentially becoming super intelligent,\nmuch more intelligent than human beings and getting-- - Well, they already are, and they're not. - When seen as a collective, you mean? - I can mean all sorts of things, but certainly, many of\nthe things that we thought were peculiar to general intelligence do not require general intelligence. So that's been one of the big\nawakenings that you can write a pretty convincing sports\nstory from stats alone. Without needing to have watched the game. So, you know, is it\npossible to write lively prose about politics? Yeah, no, not yet. So, we're sort of all over the map. One of the things about chess, there's a question I once asked on Quora that didn't get a lot of response, which was, what is the greatest\nbrilliancy ever produced by a computer in a chess game? Which was different than the question of what is the greatest game ever played. So if you think about brilliancies, is what really animates many of us to think of chess as an art form. Those are those moves and combinations that just show such\nflair, panache and soul. Computers weren't really great at that. They were great positional monsters. And recently we've started\nseeing brilliancies. - [Lex] Yeah, a few\ngrandmasters have identified with AlphaZero that things\nwere quite brilliant. - Yeah, so that's an example of something. We don't that that's AGI,\nbut in a very restricted set of rules like chess,\nyou're starting to see poetry of a high order. And so I don't like the idea\nthat we're waiting for AGI. AGI is sort of slowly infiltrating\nour lives in the same way that I don't think a worm should be, you know C. Elegans shouldn't\nbe treated as non conscious because it only has 300 neurons. Maybe it just has a very\nlow level of consciousness. Because we don't understand what these things mean as they scale up. So, am I worried about\nthis general phenomena? Sure, but I think that one of the things that's happening is that\na lot of us are fretting about this in part because of human needs. We've always been worried\nabout the Golem, right? - [Lex] Well, the Golem is\nthe artificially created-- - Life, you know? - [Lex] It's like Frankenstein\ntype of character-- - Yeah, sure, it's a Jewish version. Frankenberg, Franken-- - Yeah, that makes sense. - Sorry, so the, but we've\nalways been worried about creating something like\nthis and it's getting closer and closer and there are ways\nin which we have to realize that the whole thing, the whole thing that we've experienced are\nthe context of our lives, is almost certainly coming to an end. And I don't mean to suggest that we won't survive, I don't know. And I don't mean to suggest\nthat it's coming tomorrow. It could be 300, 500\nyears, but there's no plan that I'm aware of, if\nwe have three rocks that we could possibly inhabit that\nare sensible within current technological dreams; the\nEarth, the Moon and Mars, and we have a very\ncompetitive civilization that is still forced\ninto violence to sort out disputes that cannot be arbitrated. It is not clear to me that we\nhave a long term future until we get to the next stage,\nwhich is to figure out whether or not the Einsteinian\nspeed limit can be broken, and that requires our source code. - Our source code, the stuff\nin our brains to figure out? What do you mean by our source code? - The source code of the context. Whatever it is that produces the quarks, the electrons, the neutrinos. - Oh, our source code,\nI got it, so this is-- - You're talking about\nthe stuff that's written in a higher level language. - Yeah, yeah, that's right. You're talking about the low\nlevel, the bits or even lower-- - Right, that's what is\ncurrently keeping us here. We can't even imagine, you\nknow, we have hair brain schemes for staying within the\nEinsteinian speed limit. You know, maybe if we\ncould just drug ourselves and go into a suspended state or we could have multiple generations of that. I think all that stuff is pretty silly. But, I think it's also pretty\nsilly to imagine that our wisdom is going to\nincrease to the point that we can have the toys we have and we're not going to use them for 500 years. - Speaking of Einstein, I had\na profound breakthrough when I realized you're just one\nletter away from the guy. - Yeah, but I'm also one\nletter away from Feinstein. - Well, you get to pick. Okay, so, unified theory. You know, you've worked, you\nenjoy the beauty of geometry. Well, I don't actually\nknow if you enjoy it. You certainly are quite good at it-- - I tremble before it.\n- Tremble before it. If you're religious that is one of the-- - I don't have to be religious. It's just so beautiful,\nyou will tremble anyway. - I just read Einstein's\nbiography and one of the ways, one of the things you've\ndone is try to explore a unified theory talking about\na 14 dimensional observerse that has the 4D space time\ncontinuum embedded in it. I'm just curious how you think, philosophically at a high level, about something more than four dimensions. How do you try to, what does\nit make you feel talking in the mathematical world about dimensions that are greater than\nthe ones we can perceive? Is there something that you take away that's more than just the math? - Well, first of all, stick\nout your tongue at me. Okay, now.\n(Lex chuckling) On the front of that tongue.\n- Yeah? - There was a sweet receptor. And next to that were salt\nreceptors on two different sides. A little bit farther back\nthere were sour receptors, and you wouldn't show me the back of your tongue where\nyour bitter receptor was. - [Lex] I show the good side always. - Okay, but that was four\ndimensions of taste receptors. But you also had pain\nreceptors on that tongue and probably heat\nreceptors on that tongue. So let's assume that you have one of each. That would be six dimensions. So when you eat something,\nyou eat a slice of pizza and it's got some hot pepper\non it, maybe some jalapeno. You're having a six\ndimensional experience, dude. - Do you think we over\nemphasize the value of time as one of the dimensions or space? Well, we certainly over\nemphasize the value of time 'cause we things to start and end, or we really don't like things\nto end, but they seem to. - Well, what if you flipped\none of the spacial dimensions into being a temporal dimension? And you and I were to meet\nin New York City and say, well where and when should we meet? And I say, how about I'll\nmeet you on 36th and Lexington at 2:00 in the afternoon and\n11 o'clock in the morning? That would be very confusing. - Well, it's so convenient for us to think about time, you mean? - We happen to be in a\ndelicious situation in which we have three dimensions\nof space and one of time, and they're woven together in\nthis sort of strange fabric where we can trade off a\nlittle space for a little time. But we still only have one dimension that is picked out relative\nto the other three. It's very much Gladys Knight and the Pips. - So, which one developed for who? Did we develop for these dimensions? Or did the dimensions, or were they always there and it doesn't-- - Well, do you imagine\nthat there isn't a place where there are four temporal dimensions? Or two and two of space and time? Or three of time and one of space? And then would time not be\nplaying the role of space? Why do you imagine that the sector that you're in is all that there is? - I certainly do not, but\nI can't imagine otherwise. I mean, I haven't done\nayahuasca or any of those drugs. I hope to one day, but-- - Instead of doing ayahuasca, you could just head over to Building Two. - That's where the mathematicians are? - [Eric] Yeah, that's where they hang. - [Lex] Just to look at some geometry? - Well just ask about\npseudo-Riemannian geometry, that's what you're interested in. (Lex chuckling)\n- [Lex] Okay. - Or you can talk to a\nshaman and end up in Peru. - And then some extra\nmoney for that trip-- - Yeah, but you won't be\nable to do any calculations if that's how you choose to go about it. - Well, a different kind of calculation-- - So to speak.\n- Yeah. One of my favorite people, Edward Franco, Berkeley professor,\nauthor of Love and Math, great title for a book,\nsaid that you were quite a remarkable intellect to\ncome up with such beautiful, original ideas in terms of\nunified theory and so on. But you were working outside academia. So, one question in developing ideas that are truly original,\ntruly interesting, what's the difference between\ninside academia and outside academia when it comes\nto developing such ideas? - Oh, it's a terrible\nchoice, a terrible choice. So, if you do it inside of academics, you are forced to constantly... show great loyalty to the consensus and you distinguish yourself with small, almost microscopic heresies to make your reputation in general. And you have very competent\npeople and brilliant people who are working together who formed\nvery deep social networks, and have a very high level of behavior, at least within mathematics\nand at least technically within physics, theoretical physics. When you go outside, you meet\nlunatics and crazy people. Madmen and these are people\nwho do not usually subscribe to the consensus position and\nalmost always lose their way. And the key question is will\nprogress likely come from someone who is miraculously\nmanaged to stay within the system and is able to\ntake on a larger amount of heresy, that is sort of unthinkable? In which case, that will be fascinating. Or, is it more likely that\nsomebody will maintain a level of discipline from outside of\nacademics and be able to make use of the freedom that comes\nfrom not having to constantly affirm your loyalty to the\nconsensus of your field. - So you've characterized\nin ways that academia, in this particular sense is declining. You posted the plot, the older population of the faculty is getting larger. The younger is getting smaller and so on. So, which direction of the two\nare you more hopeful about? - Well, the Baby Boomers\ncan't hang on forever. - Which is first of all in general true, and second of all in academia-- - But that's really what\nthis time is about-- - Is the Baby Boomers control.\n- Is we didn't, we're used to like financial bubbles\nthat last a few years in length and then pop. - Yes.\n- The Baby Boomer bubble is this really long lived\nthing and all of the ideology, all of the behavior patterns,\nthe norms, you know, for example string theory is an almost entirely Baby Boomer phenomena. It was something that Baby\nBoomers were able to do because it required a very high level\nof mathematical ability. - You don't think of string\ntheory as an original idea? - Oh, I mean it was original to Veneziano who probably is older\nthan the Baby Boomers and there are people who are younger than the Baby Boomers who are\nstill doing string theory. And I'm not saying that\nnothing discovered within the large string theoretic\ncomplex is wrong. Quite the contrary. A lot of brilliant mathematics\nand a lot of the structure of physics was elucidated\nby string theorists. What do I think of the deliverable nature of this product that will not\nship called string theory? I think that is largely an\naffirmative action program for highly mathematically\nand geometrically talented Baby Boomer\nphysicists so that they can say that they're\nworking on something within the constraints of what they\nwill say is quantum gravity. Now there are other schemes. You know, there's like asymptotic safety. There are other things that\nyou could imagine doing. I don't think much of any\nof the major programs, but to have inflicted this\nlevel of loyalty through a shibboleth, well surely\nyou don't question x. Well, I question almost\neverything in the string program, and that's why I got out of physics. When you called me\nphysicist, was a great honor, but the reason I didn't become a physicist wasn't that I fell in\nlove with mathematics. As I said, wow, in 1984, 1983,\nI saw the field going mad, and I saw that mathematics,\nwhich has all sorts of problems, was not going insane. And so instead of studying\nthings within physics, I thought it was much safer to study the same objects within mathematics. And there's a huge price to pay for that. You lose physical intuition. But the point is, is that it wasn't a North Korean reeducation camp, either. - Are you hopeful about cracking open the Einstein Unified\nTheory in a way that has, in really understanding\nwhether uniting everything together with quantum theory and so on? - I mean, I'm trying to\nplay this role myself. To do it to the extent of\nhanding it over to the more responsible, more professional,\nmore competent community. So, I think that they're\nwrong about a great number of their belief structures,\nbut I do believe, I mean I have a really\nprofound love hate relationship with this group of people. - On the physics side?\n- Oh yeah. - 'Cause the mathematicians actually seem to be much more open minded and-- - Well, they are and they aren't. They're open minded about anything that looks like great math. - Right.\n- Right, they'll study something that isn't\nvery important physics, but if it's beautiful\nmathematics then they'll have, they have great intuition\nabout these things. As good as the mathematicians are, and I might even intellectually at some horsepower level\ngive them the edge. The theoretical physics\ncommunity is bar none, the most profound intellectual community that we have ever created. It is the number one, there\nis nobody in second place as far as I'm concerned. Like, in their spare time,\nin the spare time they invented molecular biology. - What was the origin\nof molecular biology? You're saying physicists-- - Well somebody like Francis Crick. A lot of the early molecular biologists-- - Were physicists?\n- Yeah, I mean you know, Schrodinger wrote What is Life and that was highly inspirational. I mean, you have to appreciate\nthat there is no community like the basic research\ncommunity in theoretical physics. And it's not something, I'm\nhighly critical of these guys. I think that they would just\nwasted the decades of time with and your religious devotion\nto their misconceptualization of where the problems were in physics. But this has been the\ngreatest intellectual collapse ever witnessed within academics. - You see it as a collapse or just a lull? - Oh, I'm terrified that we're\nabout to lose the vitality. We can't afford to pay these people. We can't afford to give them\nan accelerator just to play with in case they find something\nat the next energy level. These people created our economy. They gave us the RAD Lab and radar. They gave us two atomic\ndevices to end World War II. They created the semi-conductor\nand the transistor to power our economy through Moore's law. As a positive externality\nof particle accelerators, they created the World Wide Web and we have the insolence to say, why should we fund you\nwith our taxpayer dollars? No, the question is, are you\nenjoying your physics dollars? Right, these guys signed the world's worst licensing agreement. - Right.\n- And, if they simply charged for every time you used a\ntransistor or a URL or enjoyed the peace that they have\nprovided during this period of time through the terrible\nweapons that they developed, or your communications devices. All of the things that power our economy, I really think came out of physics, even to the extent that\nchemistry came out of physics, and molecular biology came out of physics. So, first of all you have to know that I'm very critical of this community. Second of all, it is our\nmost important community. We have neglected it, we've abused it, we don't take it seriously,\nwe don't even care to get them to rehab after a couple\nof generations of failure. Right, no one, I mean I\nthink the youngest person to have really contributed\nto the standard model at a theoretical level\nwas born in 1951, right? Frank Wilczek. And almost nothing has happened\nthat in theoretical physics after 1973, '74, that\nsent somebody to Stockholm for theoretical development\nthat predicted experiment. So, we have to understand that we are doing this to ourselves. Now, with that said, these\nguys have behaved abysmally, in my opinion, because\nthey haven't owned up to where they actually are, what problems they're really facing, how definite they can actually be. They haven't shared some of their most brilliant discoveries,\nwhich are desperately needed in other fields like gauge theory, which at least the\nmathematicians can share, which is an upgrade of\nthe differential calculus of Newton and Leibniz, and they haven't shared the importance of renormalization theory,\neven though this should be standard operating\nprocedure for people across the sciences dealing with different layers and different levels of phenomena, so-- - And by shared you mean\ncommunicated in such a way that it disseminates throughout\nthe different sciences? - These guys are sitting,\nboth theoretical physicists and mathematicians are sitting on top of a giant stockpile of\nintellectual gold, right? They have so many things that have not been manifested anywhere. I was just on Twitter I think I mentioned the Hoberman switch pitch that shows the self\nduality of the tetrahedron realizes that it linkage mechanism. Now this is like a triviality and it makes an amazing toy that's, you know, built a market.\n- Yeah. - Hopefully a fortune for Chuck Hoberman. Well, you have no idea\nhow much great stuff that these priests have\nin their monastery. - So, it's a truly a love and\nhate relationship for you? It sounds like it's\nmore on the love side-- - [Eric] This building\nthat we're in right here. - Yes. - Is the building in which\nI really put together the conspiracy between the\nNational Academy of Sciences and the National Science\nFoundation through the Government University\nIndustry Research round table to destroy the bargaining\npower of American academics using foreign labor. On microfiche in the base.\n- Post docs and so on? - Oh yeah, that was done\nhere in this building. Isn't that weird? - I'm truly speaking with a\nrevolutionary and a radical-- - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. At an intellectual level, I\nam absolutely garden variety. I'm just straight down the middle. The system that we are in. This University is functionally insane. - [Lex] Yeah. - Harvard is functionally\ninsane and we don't understand that when we\nget these things wrong, the financial crisis made this very clear. There was a long period\nwhere every grownup, everybody with a tie who\nspoke in baritone tones with a right degree at\nthe end of their name. - Yeah.\n- Were talking about how we banished volatility, we\nwere in the great moderation. Okay, they were all crazy. And who was right? It was like Nassim Taleb. - Right.\n- Nouriel Roubini. Now, what happens is is that they claimed the market went crazy. But the market didn't go crazy. The market had been crazy\nand what happened is is that it suddenly went sane. Well that's where we are with academics. Academics right now is mad as a hatter and it's absolutely evident. I can show you graph after graph. I can show you the internal discussions. I can show you the conspiracies. Harvard's dealing with one\nright now over its admissions policies for people of color\nwho happen to come from Asia. All of this madness is necessary\nto keep the game going. What we're talking about,\njust while we're on the topic of revolutionaries,\nis we're talking about the danger of an outbreak of sanity. - Yeah, you're the guy pointing out the elephant in the room here and-- - The elephant has no clothes. - Is that how that goes? I was gonna talk a little\nbit to Joe Rogan about this, ran out of time, but\nI think you have some, just listening to you, you\ncan probably speak really eloquently to academia on the difference between the different fields. So, do you think there's a\ndifference between science, engineering and then the\nhumanities in academia, in terms of tolerance, that\nthey're willing to tolerate? So, from my perspective I\nthought computer science and maybe engineering is more\ntolerant to radical ideas, but that's perhaps innocent of me. 'Cause I always, you know\nall the battles going on now are a little bit\nmore of the humanities side and gender studies and so on. - Have you seen the American\nMathematical Society's publication of an essay\ncalled Get out the Way. - I have not, what's the--\n- The idea is that white men who hold positions within\nUniversities in mathematics should vacate their positions\nso that young black women can take over or something like this. - That's in terms of diversity, which I also wanted to ask you about, but in terms of diversity\nof strictly ideas. - Oh, sure.\n- Do you think, 'cause you're basically\nsaying physics as a community, has become a little bit\nintolerant to some degree, to new radical ideas or\nat least you said that-- - But it's changed a little bit recently. Which is that even string\ntheory is now admitting, okay, this doesn't look very\npromising in the short term. Right, so the question is what compiles, if you wanna take the\ncomputer science metaphor. What will get you into a journal? Will you spend your life\ntrying to push some paper into a journal or will\nit be accepted easily? What do we know about the\ncharacteristics of the submitter and what gets taken up and what does not? All of these fields are\nexperiencing pressure because no field is performing so\nbrilliantly well that it's revolutionizing our way\nof speaking and thinking, in the ways in which we\nhave become accustomed. - But don't you think, even\nin theoretical physics, a lot of times, even with\ntheories like string theory, you could speak to this,\nit does eventually lead to what are the ways that this\ntheory would be testable? - Yeah, ultimately, although look, there's this thing about Popper and the scientific method that's a cancer and a disease in the minds\nof very smart people. That's not really how most\nof the stuff gets worked out, it's how it gets checked. - Right, so--\n- And there is a dialog between theory and experiment. But, everybody should\nread Paul Dirac's 1963 Scientific American article where he, you know, it's very interesting. He talks about it as if it was about the Schrodinger equation\nand Schrodinger's failure to advance his own work\nbecause of his failure to account for some phenomena. The key point is that if your\ntheory is a slight bit off, it won't agree with experiment, but it doesn't mean that the\ntheory is actually wrong. But Dirac could as easily have\nbeen talking about his own equation in which he predicted that the electrons should\nhave an anti-particle. And since the only positively\ncharged particle that was known at the time was the\nproton, Heisenberg pointed out, well shouldn't your\nanti-particle, the proton, have the same mass as the electron and doesn't that invalidate your theory? So, I think that Dirac was actually being, potentially quite sneaky\nin talking about the fact that he had been pushed\noff of his own theory, to some extent, by Heisenberg. But look, we fetishize\nthe scientific method and Popper and falsification\nbecause it protects us from crazy ideas entering the field. So, you know, it's a question\nof balancing type one and type two error and we were pretty\nmaxed out in one direction. - The opposite of that. Let me say what comforts me. Sort of biology or engineering\nat the end of the day, does the thing work?\n- Yeah. - You can test the crazies away. Well see now, you're saying\nbut some ideas are truly crazy and some are actually correct, so. - Well there's pre-correct\ncurrently crazy. - Yeah.\n- Right? And so you don't wanna\nget rid of everybody who's pre-correct and currently crazy. The problem is is that we don't\nhave standards in general, for trying to determine who has to be put to the sword in terms of their career and who has to be protected\nas some sort of giant time suck pain in the ass who\nmay change everything. - Do you think that's possible? Creating a mechanism of those selective-- - Well, you're not gonna like\nthe answer, but here it comes. - [Lex] Oh, boy. - It has to do with very human elements. We're trying to do this\nat the level of like rules and fairness, it's not gonna work. 'Cause the only thing that\nreally understands this, you ever read The Double Helix? - It's a book? - Oh, you have to read this book-- - Oh, boy.\n- Not only did Jim Watson half discover this three\ndimensional structure of DNA, he was also one hell of a\nwriter before he became an ass. No, he's tried\n- Yes, like he is. - To destroy his own reputation-- - I knew about the ass, I didn't\nknow about the good writer. - Jim Watson is one of the most\nimportant people now living, and as I've said before,\nJim Watson is too important a legacy to be left to Jim Watson. That book tells you more about\nwhat actually moves the dial. I mean, there's another\nstory about him which I don't agree with, which is that he stole everything from Rosalind Franklin. I mean, the problems that he\nhad with Rosalind Franklin are real, but we should\nactually honor that tension in our history by delving into it, rather than having a simple solution. Jim Watson talks about Francis\nCrick being a pain in the ass that everybody secretly\nknew was super brilliant. And there's an encounter between\nChargaff who came up with the equimolar relations\nbetween the nucleotides, who should've gotten the structure of DNA and Watson and Crick, and you know, he talks\nabout missing a shiver in the heartbeat of biology\nand this stuff is so gorgeous, it just makes you tremble\neven thinking about it. Look, we know very often\nwho is to be feared, and we need to fund the\npeople that we fear. The people who are wasting our time need to be excluded from the conversation. You see, and you know,\nmaybe we'll make some errors in both directions, but we\nhave known our own people. We know the pains in the\nasses that might work out, and we know the people who\nare really just blowhards who really have very little to\ncontribute most of the time. It's not 100%, but you're not\ngonna get there with rules. - Right, it's using some kind of instinct. I mean, to be honest, I'm\ngonna make you roll your eyes for a second, but in the\nfirst time I heard that there was large community of people\nwho believe the earth is flat, actually made me pause and\nask myself the question-- - Why would there be such a community? - Yeah, is it possible the earth is flat? So I had to like, wait a minute. I mean, then you go\nthrough a thinking process that I think is really healthy. It ultimately ends up being\na geometry thing I think. It's an interesting thought\nexperiment at the very least. - Well, see I don't, I do\na different version of it. I say, why is this community stable? - Yeah, that's a good way to analyze it. - Interesting that whatever we've done has not erased the community. So, you know, they're\ntaking a long shot bet that won't pan out, you know? Maybe we just haven't thought enough about the rationality of the square root of two and somebody brilliant will figure it out. Maybe we will eventually land one day on the surface of Jupiter and explore it. Right, these are crazy things\nthat will never happen. - So, much of social media\noperates by AI algorithms, we talked this a little bit, recommending the content you see. So, on this idea of radical\nthought, how much should AI show you things you disagree\nwith on Twitter and so on? In the Twitterverse in the-- - I hate this question. - Yeah?\n- Yeah. - 'Cause you don't know the answer? - No, no, no, no. Look, they've pushed\nout this cognitive Lego to us that will just lead to madness. It's good to be challenged with things that you disagree with. You answer is, no. It's gonna to be challenged\nwith interesting things with which you currently disagree,\nbut that might be true. I don't really care about\nwhether or not I disagree with something or don't\ndisagree, I need to know why that particular disagreeable\nthing is being pushed out. Is it because it's likely to be true? Is it because, is there some reason? Because I write a computer\ngenerator to come up with an infinite number\nof disagreeable statements that nobody needs to look at. So, please before you push things at me that are disagreeable, tell me why. - There is an aspect in which\nthat question is quite dumb, especially because it's\nbeing used to almost very generically by these\ndifferent networks to say, well we're trying to work this out, but you know, basically how much, do you see the value of\nseeing things you don't like? Not you disagree with, because\nit's very difficult to know exactly what you articulated,\nwhich is the stuff that's important for you to consider\nthat you disagree with. That's really hard to figure out. The bottom line is the\nstuff you don't like. If you're a Hillary Clinton supporter, it might not make you feel good to see anything about Donald Trump. That's the only thing algorithms can really optimize for currently. They really can't--\n- No, they can do better. - You think so?\n- No, we're engaged in some moronic back and forth where\nI have no idea why people who are capable of building Google, Facebook, Twitter are having us in these incredibly low level discussions. Do they not know any smart people? Do they not have the phone numbers of people who can elevate\nthese discussions? - They do, but this-- - Please, no, no, no.\n- They're optimizing for a different thing and they are pushing those people out of those rooms. - No, they're optimizing\nfor things we can't see, and yes, profit is there. Nobody's questioning that. But they're also optimizing\nfor things like political control or the fact that\nthey're doing business in Pakistan and so they don't\nwanna talk about all the things that they're going\nto bending to in Pakistan. So, we're involved in a fake discussion. - You think so, you\nthink these conversations at that depth are happening inside Google? You don't think they have some basic metrics under user engagements? - You're having a fake\nconversation with us, guys. We know you're having a fake conversation. I do not wish to be part\nof your fake conversation. You know how to cool these units. You know high availability\nlike nobody's business. My Gmail never goes down, almost. - So you think just because\nthey can do incredible work on the software side with infrastructure, they can also deal with some\nof these difficult questions about human behavior, human understanding, you're not, (chuckling). - I mean, I've seen\nthe developer's screens that people take shots\nof inside of Google. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I've heard stories\ninside of Facebook and Apple. We're not, we're engaged, they're engaging us in the wrong conversations. We are not at this low level. Here's one of my favorite questions. - Yeah.\n- Why is every piece of hardware that I purchase in text base equipped as a listening device? Where's my physical\nshutter to cover my lens? We had this in the 1970s. They had cameras that\nhad lens caps, you know? How much would it cost\nto have a security model? Pay five extra bucks. Why is my indicator light\nsoftware controlled? Why when my camera is on, do\nI not see that the light is on by putting it as something\nthat cannot be bypassed? Why have you setup all of my devices, at some difficulty to yourselves, as listening devices and we\ndon't even talk about this. This thing is total fucking bullshit. - Well, I hope, so.\n- Wait, wait, wait. - These discussions are\nhappening about privacy, 'cause they're more difficult\nthan you give 'em credit for-- - It's not just privacy.\n- Yeah? - It's about social control. We're talking about social control. Why do I not have controls\nover my own levers? Just have a really cute\nUI, where I can switch, I can dial things or I can at least see what the algorithms are. - You think that there are some deliberate choices being made here-- - There's emergence\nand there is intention. There are two dimensions. The vector does not\ncollapse onto either axis. But the idea that anybody who suggests that intention is completely\nabsent is a child. - That's really beautifully\nput and like many things you've said is gonna make me-- - Can I turn this around slightly though? - Yeah.\n- I sit down with you and you say that you're\nobsessed with my feed. - Uh huh.\n- I don't even know what my feed is, what are\nyou seeing that I'm not? - I was obsessively looking\nthrough your feed on Twitter, 'cause it was really\nenjoyable because there's the Tom Lehrer element,\nthere's the humor in it. - By the way that feed is\nericrweinstein on Twitter. - That's great.\n- @ericrweinstein. - Yeah.\n- No, but seriously, why? - Why did I find it enjoyable\nor what was I seeing? - What are you looking for? Why are we doing this? What is this podcast about? I know you got all these\ninteresting people. I'm just some guy who is\nsort of a podcast guest. - Sort of a podcast, you're\nnot even wearing a tie. I mean,\n- I'm not even wearing a tie. - It's not even a serious interview. I was searching for\nmeaning, for happiness, for a dopamine rush, so\nshort term and long term. - And how are you finding your way to me? What is, I don't honestly know\nwhat I'm doing to reach you. - The representing ideas\nwhich field common sense to me and not many people are speaking. So it's kinda like, the\nIntellectual Dark Web folks, right? These folks, from Sam\nHarris to Jordan Peterson, to yourself, are saying\nthings where it's like, you're like saying,\nlook there's an elephant and he's not wearing any\nclothes and I say, yeah, yeah, let's have more of that conversation. That's how I'm finding you. - I'm desperate to try to change the conversation we're having. I'm very worried we've\ngot an election in 2020. I don't think we can\nafford four more years of a misinterpreted message,\nwhich is what Donald Trump was, and I don't want the\ndestruction of our institutions. They all seem hellbent\non destroying themselves. So, I'm trying to save\ntheoretical physics, trying to save the New York Times, trying to save our various\nprocesses and I think it feels delusional to me that this\nis falling to a tiny group of people who are willing\nto speak out without getting so freaked out that everything they say will be misinterpreted\nand that their lives will be ruined through the process. I mean, I think we're in an\nabsolutely bananas period of time and I don't believe\nit should fall to such a tiny number of shoulders\nto shoulder this weight. - So, I have to ask you\non a capitalism side, you mentioned that technology\nis killing capitalism or has effects that are,\nwell not unintended, but not what economists would predict or speak of capitalism creating. I just wanna talk to you about in general, the effect of even then,\nartificial intelligence or technology automation taking\naway jobs and these kinds of things and what you think\nis the way to alleviate that. Whether the Andrew Ang\npresidential candidate with universal basic income, UBI,\nwhat are your thoughts there? How do we fight off the negative effects of technology that-- - All right, you're a software guy, right? - Yep. - A human being is a\nworker, is an old idea. - Yes.\n- A human being has a worker is a different object, right?\n- Yes. - So if you think about\nobject oriented programming as a paradigm, a human being has a worker and a human being has a soul. We're talking about the fact\nthat for a period of time, the worker that a human being has, was in a position to feed the\nsoul that a human being has. However, we have two separate claims on the value in society. One is as a worker and\nthe other is as a soul, and the soul needs\nsustenance, it needs dignity, it needs meaning, it needs purpose. As long as you're means of\nsupport is not highly repetitive, I think you have a while to go before you need to start worrying. But if what you do is highly repetitive and it's not terrible generative,\nyou are in the crosshairs of for loops and while loops and that's what computers accel at;\nrepetitive behavior and when I say repetitive I may mean things\nthat have never happened through combinatorial possibilities, but as long as it has a\nlooped characteristic to it, you're in trouble. We are seeing a massive\npush towards socialism because capitalists are slow to address the fact that a worker may\nnot be able to make claims. A relatively undistinguished\nmedian member of our society still has needs to\nreproduce, needs to dignity and when capitalism abandons\nthe median individual or the bottom tenth or\nwhatever it's going to do, it's flirting with revolution\nand what concerns me is that the capitalists\naren't sufficiently capitalistic to understand this. You really want to court\nauthoritarian control in our society because you\ncan't see that people may not be able to defend themselves\nin the marketplace because the marginal\nproduct of their labor is too low to feed\ntheir dignity as a soul? So, my great concern is\nthat our free society has to do with the fact\nthat we are self organized. I remember looking down\nfrom my office in Manhattan when Lehman Brothers\ncollapsed and thinking, who's gonna tell all these\npeople that they need to show up at work when they\ndon't have a financial system to incentivize them to show up at work? So, my complaint is first of\nall, not with the socialists, but with the capitalists, which is you guys are being idiots. You're courting revolution by\ncontinuing to harp on the same old ideas that well, try\nharder, bootstrap yourself. Yeah, to an extent that\nworks, to an extent. But we are clearly headed in\na place that there's nothing that ties together our need\nto contribute and our need to consume and that may not\nbe provided by capitalism, because it may have been\na temporary phenomena. So, check out my article\non anthropic capitalism and the new gimmick economy. I think people are late\ngetting the wake up call, and we would be doing a\nbetter job saving capitalism from itself because I don't want this done under authoritarian control,\nand the more we insist that everybody who's not thriving\nin our society during their reproductive years in\norder to have a family, is failing at a personal level. I mean, what a disgusting\nthing that we're saying. What a horrible message. Who the hell have we\nbecome that we've so bought in to the Chicago model that\nwe can't see the humanity that we're destroying in that process and I hate the thought of\ncommunism, I really do. My family has flirted\nwith it decades past, it's a wrong, bad idea, but\nwe are going to need to figure out how to make sure that\nthose souls are nourished and respected and capitalism\nbetter have an answer. And I'm betting on capitalism,\nbut I gotta tell ya, I'm pretty disappointed with my team. - So you're still on the capitalism team, just there's a theme here-- - [Eric] Well, radical capitalism. - Right, hyper capitalism, yeah. - Look, I want, I think\nhyper capitalism is gonna have to be coupled to hyper socialism. You need to allow the\nmost productive people to create wonders and you\ngotta stop bogging them down with all of these extra nice requirements. You know, nice is dead. Good has a future. Nice doesn't have a future\nbecause nice ends up with gulags. - Damn, that's a good line. Okay, last question. You Tweeted today, a simple,\nquite insightful equation saying \"Imagine that every\nunit f of fame you picked up, \"s stalkers and h haters\". So, I imagine s and h are dependent on your path to fame,\nperhaps a little bit-- - Well, it's not a simple. I mean, people always take\nthese things literally when you have like 280\ncharacters to explain yourself. - So you mean that's not a mathematical-- - No, there's no law.\n- Oh, okay, all right. - I just, I put the word\nimagine because I still have a mathematicians\ndesire for precision. - Yes.\n- Imagine that this were true. - But there was a beautiful way to imagine that there is a law that\nhas those variables in it-- - [Eric] Yeah, yeah. - And you've become\nquite famous these days, so how do you yourself\noptimize that equation with the peculiar kind of fame that\nyou've gathered along the way? - I wanna be kinder. I wanna be kinder to myself,\nI wanna kinder to others, I wanna be able to have heart, compassion and these things\nare really important, and I have a pretty spectrumy\nkind of approach to analysis. I'm quite literal. I can go full Rain Man on\nyou at any given moment. No, I can, I can. It's facultative autism, if you like, and people are gonna get angry because they want autism\nto be respected, but. When you see me coding or\nyou see me doing mathematics, you know, I speak with\nspeech apnea, (stutters), be right down for dinner, you know? - [Lex] Yeah. - We have to try to integrate ourselves in those tensions between, you know, it's sort of back to us as\na worker and us as a soul. Many of us are optimizing one\nat the expense of the other. And I struggle with social\nmedia and I struggle with people making threats against our\nfamilies and I struggle with just how much pain people are in. And if there's one message I\nwould like to push out there, you're responsible, everybody, all of us, myself included, with struggling. Struggle mightily because it's nobody else's job to do your struggle for you. Now with that said, if you're\nstruggling and you're trying, and you're trying to figure\nout how to better yourself and where you've failed, where\nyou've let down your family, your friends, your workers,\nall this kind of stuff, give yourself a break, you know? If it's not working out, I\nhave a lifelong relationship with failure and success. There's been no period\nof my life where both haven't been present\nin one form or another. And, I do wish to say that a lot of the times people\nthink this is glamorous. I'm about to go, you know,\ndo a show with Sam Harris. - Yeah.\n- People are gonna listen in on two guys having a\nconversation on stage. It's completely crazy when I'm\nalways trying to figure out how to make sure that those\npeople get maximum value and that's why I'm doing this podcast, you know, just give yourself a break. You owe us your struggle. You don't owe your\nfamily or your coworkers or your lovers or your\nfamily members success. As long as you're in there and\nyou're picking yourself up, recognize that this new\nsituation with the economy that doesn't have the juice\nto sustain our institutions, has caused the people\nwho've risen to the top of those institutions to\nget quite brutal and cruel. Everybody is lying at the moment. Nobody is really truth teller. Try to keep your humanity about you. Try to recognize that if you're failing, if things aren't where you\nwant them to be and you're struggling and you're trying to figure out what you're doing wrong,\nwhat you could do, it's not necessarily all your fault. We are in a global situation. I have not met the people who are honest, kind, good, successful. Nobody that I've met is\nchecking all the boxes. Nobody's getting all 10s. So, I just think that's\nan important message that doesn't get pushed out enough. Either people wanna\nhold society responsible for their failures,\nwhich is not reasonable. You have to struggle, you have to try. Or they wanna say you're 100%\nresponsible for your failures, which is total nonsense. - Beautifully put. Eric, thank you so much for talking today. - Thanks for having me, buddy."
