      "text": "- The act of remembering\ncan change the memory. If you remember some event, and then I tell you\nsomething about the event, later on when you remember\nthe event you might remember some original information from the event, as well as some information\nabout what I told you. And sometimes if you're not\nable to tell the difference, that information that\nI told you gets mixed into the story that you had originally. So now I give you some\nmore misinformation, or you're exposed to some more information somewhere else, and eventually your memory becomes totally detached\nfrom what happened. - The following is a conversation\nwith Charan Ranganath, a psychologist and\nneuroscientist at UC Davis specializing in human memory. He's the author of \"Why We Remember: Unlocking Memory's Power to\nHold on to What Matters.\" This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Charan Ranganath."

      "section": "Experiencing self vs remembering self",
      "text": "Danny Kahneman describes\nthe experiencing self and the remembering self and that happiness and\nsatisfaction you gain from the outcomes of your\ndecisions do not come from what you've experienced, but rather from what you\nremember of the experience. So can you speak to this\ninteresting difference that you write about in your book, of the experiencing self\nand the remembering self? - Danny really impacted me,\n'cause I was an undergrad at Berkeley and I got to\ntake a class from him, long before he won the\nNobel Prize or anything. And it was just a mind blowing class. But this idea of the remembering self and the experiencing self, I got into it because\nit's so much about memory, even though he doesn't study memory. So we're right now having\nthis experience, right? And people can watch it\npresumably on YouTube, or listen to it on audio, but if you're talking to somebody else, you could probably describe\nthis whole thing in 10 minutes. But that's going to miss a\nlot of what actually happened. And so the idea there is\nis that the way we remember things is not the replay\nof the experience, it's something totally different, and it tends to be biased by\nthe beginning and the end, and he talks about the peaks, but there's also the, you\nknow, the the best parts, the worst parts, et cetera. And those are the things that we remember. And so when we make decisions,\nwe usually consult memory and we feel like our memory is a record of what we've experienced, but it's not, it's this\nkind of very biased sample, but it's biased in an interesting and, I think, biologically relevant way. - So in the way we construct\na narrative about our past, you say that it gives us\nan illusion of stability. Can you explain that? - Basically I think that a\nlot of learning in the brain is driven towards being\nable to make sense. I mean really memory is\nall about the present and the future. The past is done, so,\nbiologically speaking, it's not important, unless there's something\nfrom the past that's useful. And so what our brains\nare really optimized for is to learn about\nthe stuff from the past that's going to be most useful\nin understanding the present and predicting the future. Right? And so cause-effect\nrelationships for instance, that's a big one. Now my future is completely unpredictable in the sense that like\nyou could, you know, in the next 10 minutes pull a knife on me and slit my throat. Right? - I was planning on it. - Exactly. But having seen some of your work and just, you know, generally\nmy expectations about life, I'm not expecting that. I have a certainty that\neverything's gonna be fine, we're gonna have a great\ntime talking today. Right? But we're often right. It's like, okay, so I go\nto see a band on stage, you know, I know they're\ngonna make me wait, the show's gonna start late and then, you know, they come on, there's a very good chance\nthere's gonna be an encore. I have a memory, so to\nspeak, for that event before I've even walked into the show. Right? There's gonna be people\nholding up their camera phones to try to take videos of it now, 'cause this is kind of\nthe world we live in. So that's like everyday fortune telling that we do though. It's not real, it's imagined. And it's amazing that\nwe have this capability, and that's what memory is about. But it can also give us the\nillusion that we know everything that's about to happen. And I think what's valuable\nabout that illusion is when it's broken it\ngives us the information. Right? So I mean, you know, I'm\nsure being in AI you know about information theory. And the idea is the information is what you didn't already have. And so those prediction errors\nthat we make based on... You know, we make a\nprediction based on memory, and the errors are where the action is. - The error is where the learning happens? - Exactly. Exactly. - Well just to linger on Danny Kahneman, and just this whole idea\nof experiencing self versus remembering self,\nI was hoping you can give a simple answer of how we should live life based on the fact that our\nmemories could be a source of happiness, or could be the\nprimary source of happiness. That an event, when experienced,\nbears its fruits the most when it's remembered over\nand over and over and over. And maybe there is some wisdom in the fact that we can\ncontrol, to some degree, how we remember it, how\nwe evolve our memory of it such that it can maximize\nthe long-term happiness of that repeated experience. - Okay, well first I'll\nsay, I wish I could take you on the road with me, because that was such a great description. - Can I be your opening act, or... - Oh my god, no, I'm\ngonna open for you, dude. Otherwise it's like, you\nknow, everybody leaves after you're done. (both laughing) Believe me, I did that\nin Columbus, Ohio once. It wasn't fun. Like the opening acts\nlike drank our bar tab. We spent all this money\ngoing all the way there, there was only the... Everybody left after the\nopening acts were done and there was just that stoner dude with the dreadlocks hanging out. And then next thing you know\nwe blew like our savings on getting a hotel room. - So we should, as a small tangent, you are a legit touring act? - When I was in grad\nschool I played in a band and, yeah, we traveled,\nwe would play shows. It wasn't like... We weren't a hardcore touring band, but we did some touring\nand had some fun times. And, yeah, we did a movie soundtrack. - Nice. - \"Henry: Portrait of Serial Killer.\" So that's a good movie. We were on the soundtrack for the sequel, \"Henry 2: Mask of Sanity,\"\nwhich is a terrible movie. - Yeah. How's the soundtrack? Is it pretty good?\n- It's badass. - All right.\n- At least that one part where the guy throws up the milkshake. - Okay, all right.\n- Which is my song. - We're gonna have to see. We're gonna have to see it. - [Charan] All right, we'll\nget you back to life advice- - And happiness, yeah. - One thing that I try to\nlive by, especially nowadays, and since I wrote the\nbook I've been thinking more and more about this, is how do I want to live a memorable life? You know, I think if we go back\nto like the pandemic, right? How many people have\nmemories from that period? Aside from the trauma of\nbeing, you know, locked up and seeing people die, and all this stuff. I think it's like one of these\nthings where we were stuck inside looking at screens all day, doing the same thing with the same people, and so I don't remember much from that in terms\nof those good memories that you're talking about. Right? You know, when I was\ngrowing up my parents worked really hard for us and, you\nknow, we went on some vacations, but not very often. And I really try to do now\nvacations to interesting places as much as possible with my family because like those are the\nthings that you remember, right? So I really do think\nabout what's going to be like something that's memorable, and then just do it, even\nif it's a pain in the ass, because the experiencing self will suffer for that, but the remembering\nself will be like, \"Yes, I'm so glad I did that.\" - Do things that are very\nunpleasant in the moment, because those can be reframed and enjoyed for many years to come. That's probably... Good advice. Or at least when you're going\nthrough shit it's a good way to see the silver lining of it. - Yeah, I mean I think\nit's one of these things where if you have like people\nwho you've gone through. I mean, since you said it, I'll just... Since you've gone through\nshit with someone. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it's like, that's a\nbonding experience often. You know? I mean that can really bring you together. I like to say it's like\nthere's no point in suffering unless you get a story out of it. (Charan laughing) So in the book I talk about the power of the way we communicate with others and how that shapes our memories. And so I had this near death experience, at least that's how I remember it, on this paddle board where just everything that could have gone wrong\ndid go wrong, almost. So many mistakes were made and\nended up, like at some point, just like basically away from\nmy board pinned in a current, like in this corner, like\nnot a super good swimmer. And my friend who came with me, Randy, who's a computational neuroscientist, and he had just been pushed down past me and so he couldn't even see me. And I'm just like, \"If I die\nhere, you know, I mean no one's around, it's like you just die alone.\" And so I just said, \"Well,\nfailure's not an option.\" And eventually I got out of\nit and froze, and got cut up. I mean the things that\nwe were going through were just insane. But short version of this\nis, you know, my wife and my daughter, and\nRandy's wife, they gave us all sorts of hell about this, 'cause they were just like, where are... They were ready to send\nout a search party. So they were giving me hell\nabout it, and then I started to tell people in my lab\nabout this, and then friends, and it just became a better\nand better story every time. And we actually had some photos of just the crazy things. Like this generator that\nwas hanging over the water and we're like ducking under the zig of these metal gratings,\nand I'm like going flat. And it was just nuts, you know? But it became a great story. And it was definitely... I mean, Randy and I were already tight, but that was a real\nbonding experience for us. And, yeah... I mean, and I learned from that\nthat it's like I don't look back on that enough actually, because I think we often, at least for me, I don't necessarily have\nthe confidence to think that things will work out, that I'll be able to get\nthrough a certain thing. But my ability to actually\nget something done in that moment is better\nthan I give myself credit for, I think. And that was the lesson of that story that I really took away. - Well, actually, just for\nme, you're making me realize now that it's not just\nthose kinds of stories, but even things like\nperiods of depression, or really low points. To me at least it feels\nlike a motivating thing that the darker it gets,\nthe better the story will be if you emerge on the other side. That, to me, feels like\na motivating thing. So maybe if people are listening to this and they're going through\nsome shit, as we said, one thing that could be a source of light is that it'll be a hell of a good story when it's all over, when you\nemerge on the other side. Let me ask you about decisions. You've already talked\nabout it a little bit, but when we face the world and we're making different decisions, how much does our memory come into play? Is it the kind of narratives\nthat we've constructed about the world that are\nused to make predictions that's fundamentally part\nof the decision making? - Absolutely, yeah. So let's say after this you and I decided we're gonna go for a beer, right? How do you choose where to go? You're probably gonna be\nlike, \"Oh, yeah, this new bar opened up near me, I\nhad a great time there, they had a great beer selection.\" Or you might say, \"Oh,\nwe went to this place and it was totally crowded\nand they were playing this horrible EDM or whatever.\" And so right there, valuable\nsource of information, right? And then you have these\nthings like where you do this counterfactual stuff like, \"Well I did this previously, but what if I had gone\nsomewhere else instead? Maybe I'll go to this other place because I didn't try\nit the previous time.\" So there's all that kind of\nreasoning that goes into it too. I think even if you think\nabout the big decisions in life, right? It's like you and I were talking\nbefore we started recording about how I got into memory\nresearch and you got into AI and it's like we all have\nthese personal reasons that guide us in these\nparticular directions. And some of it's the environment\nand random factors in life and some of it is memories of\nthings that we wanna overcome, or things that we build\non in a positive way. But either way they define us. - And probably the earlier\nin life the memories happen the more defining power they have in terms of determining who we become. - I mean, I do feel like\nadolescence is much more important than I think people give credit for. I think that there is this\nkind of a sense like, you know, the first three years of life\nis the most important part, but the teenage years\nare just so important for the brain, you know? And so that's where a\nlot of mental illness starts to emerge. You know, now we're thinking\nof things like schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disorder because it just emerges during that period of adolescence and early adulthood. So... And I think the other part\nof it is, is that, you know, as, I guess I was a little\nbit too firm in saying that memory determines who we are. It's really the self is\nan evolving construct. I think we kind of underestimate that. And when you're a parent\nyou feel like every decision you make is consequential\nin forming this child. And it plays a role, but\nso do the child's peers. And so do you know, there's so much... I mean, that's why I think\nthe big part of education I think that's so important\nis not the content you learn. I mean, think of how much dumb\nstuff we learned in school. Right? But a lot of it is learning\nhow to get along with people, and learning who you are,\nand how you function. And, you know, that can\nbe terribly traumatizing even if you have perfect, you\nknow, parents working on you."

      "section": "Creating memories",
      "text": "- Is there some insight\ninto the human brain that explains why we\ndon't seem to remember anything from the first few years of life? - Yeah, yeah. In fact, actually I was just talking to my really good friend and\ncolleague, Simona Ghetti, who studies the neuroscience\nof child development. And so we were talking about this. And so there are a bunch\nof reasons I would say. So one reason is, is\nthere's an area of the brain called the hippocampus,\nwhich is very, very important for remembering events,\nor episodic memory. And so the first two years\nof life there's a period called infantile amnesia. And then the next couple of years of life after that, there's a period\ncalled childhood amnesia. And the difference is is\nthat basically in the lab and, you know, even during\nchildhood and afterwards, children basically don't\nhave any episodic memories for those first two years. The next two years it's very fragmentary, and that's why they call\nit childhood amnesia. So there's some, but it's not much. So one reason is that the\nhippocampus is taking some time to develop, but another is the neocortex, so the whole folded stuff\nof gray matter all around the hippocampus, is developing so rapidly and changing and a child's\nknowledge of the world is just massively being built up, right? So I mean, I'm gonna\nprobably embarrass myself, but it's like if you showed\nlike, you know, you trained a neural network and you\ngive it like the first couple of patterns, or something like\nthat, and then you bombard it with another like, you\nknow, years worth of data, try to get back those first\ncouple of patterns, right? It's like everything changes. And so the brain is so plastic, the cortex is so plastic during that time. And we think that memories for\nevents are very distributed across the brain. So imagine you're trying to get back that pattern of activity that happened during this one moment, but\nthe roads that you would take to get there have been\ncompletely rerouted, right? So I think that's my best explanation. The third explanation is\na child's sense of self takes a while to develop. And so their experience of\nlearning might be more learning what happened as opposed\nto having this first person experience of, \"I remember, I was there.\" - Well I think somebody once said to me that, kind of loosely, philosophically, that the reason we don't\nremember the first few years of life, infantile amnesia, is\nbecause how traumatic it is. Basically the error\nrate that you mentioned, when your brain's prediction\ndoesn't match reality, the error rate in the\nfirst few years of life, your first few months certainly,\nis probably crazy high. It's just nonstop freaking out. The collision between\nyour model of the world and how the world works is just so high that you want whatever the trauma of that is not to linger around. I always thought that's\nan interesting idea because like, just imagine the\ninsanity of what's happening in a human brain in\nthe first couple years. Just, you don't know anything, and then there's just\nthis stream of knowledge and we're somehow, given\nhow plastic everything is, it just kind of molds and figures it out. But it's like an insane\nwaterfall of information. - I wouldn't necessarily\ndescribe it as a trauma, and we can get into this\nwhole stages of life thing, which I just love. Basically those first few\nyears there are, I mean, you know, I mean think about\nit, a kid's internal model of their body is changing, right? It's like just learning to move. I mean like, you know, if you\never have a baby you'll know that like the first three months they're discovering their toes. Right? It's just nuts. So everything is changing. But what's really fascinating is, and I think this is one of those... This is not at all me being a scientist, but it's like one of those\nthings that people talk about when they talk about the,\nyou know, positive aspects of children is that they're\nexceptionally curious and they have this kind of\nopenness towards the world. And so that prediction error is not a negative, traumatic thing. I think it's like a very positive thing because it's what they use,\nthey're seeking information. One of the areas that I'm very interested in is the prefrontal cortex. It's an area of the brain that... I mean, I could talk all day about it, but it helps us use our knowledge to say, \"Hey, this is what I want\nto do now, this is my goal, so this is how I'm going to achieve it.\" And focus everything\ntowards that goal, right? The prefrontal cortex takes\nforever to develop in humans. The connections are still being tweaked and reformed like into late\nadolescence, early adulthood, which is when you tend to see\nmental illness pop up, right? So it's being massively reformed. Then you have about 10 years,\nmaybe, of prime functioning of the prefrontal cortex and\nthen it starts going down again and you end up being older and you start losing all\nthat frontal function. So I look at this and\nyou'd say, okay, from... You sit around episodic memory talks, we'll always say children\nare worse than adults at episodic memory, older adults\nare worse than young adults at episodic memory. And I always would say,\n\"God, this is so weird, why would we have this period\nof time that's so short when we're perfect?\" Right? Or optimal. And I like to use the word optimal now because there's such a culture\nof optimization right now. And it's like, I realize I have\nto redefine what optimal is because for most of the human condition I think we had a series of stages of life where you have basically\nadults saying, \"Okay,\" young adults saying, \"I've got a child and, you know, I'm part of this village and I have to hunt and\nforage and get things done. I need a prefrontal cortex so I can stay focused on the big picture and the long haul goals.\" Now I'm a child, I'm in this\nvillage, I'm kinda wandering around and I've got some safety and I need to learn about this culture because I know so little. What's the best way to do that? Let's explore. I don't wanna be constrained\nby goals as much. I wanna really be free,\nplay, and explore, and learn. So you don't want a super\ntight prefrontal cortex. You don't even know what\nthe goals should be yet. Right? It's like if you're\ntrying to design a model that's based on a bad goal, it's not gonna work well, right? So then you go late in life and you say, \"Oh, why don't you have a\ngreat prefrontal cortex then?\" But I think, I mean if you go back and you think how many\nspecies actually stick around naturally long after\ntheir childbearing years are over, after the\nreproductive years are over? Like menopause. From what I understand,\nmenopause is not all that common in the animal world, right? So why would that happen? And so I saw Alison Gopnik\nsaid something about this, so I started to look into\nthis, about this idea that, you know, really when\nyou're older, in most societies, your job is no longer to\nform new episodic memories, it's to pass on the memories\nthat you already have, this knowledge about the world, what we call semantic memory, to pass on that semantic memory\nto the younger generations, pass on the culture. You know, even now in indigenous cultures, that's the role of the elders. And they're respected, they're not seen as, you know, people who\nare past it and losing it. And I thought that was\na very poignant thing, that memory's doing what it's supposed to throughout these stages of life. - So it is always optimal in a sense. - Yeah.\n- It's just optimal for that stage of life. - Yeah, and for the ecology of the system. So you've got... So I looked into this and\nit's like another species that has menopause is orcas. Orca pods are led by\nthe grandmothers, right? So not the young adults,\nnot the parents or whatever, the grandmothers. And so they're the ones\nthat pass on the traditions to the, I guess, the\nyounger generation of orcas. And if you, you know, if you look, from what little I understand, different orca pods have\ndifferent traditions, they hunt for different things, they have different play traditions, and that's a culture, right? And so in social animals\nevolution, I think, is designing brains that are really around, you know, it's obviously optimized for the individual but also for kin. And I think that the kin are part of this, like when they're a part of\nthis intense social group, the brain development\nshould parallel that, the nature of the ecology. - Well it is just fascinating to think of the individual orca, or\nhuman, throughout his life in stages doing a kind of\noptimal wisdom development. So in the early days you don't\neven know what the goal is, then you figure out the goal and you kind of optimize for that goal and you pursue that goal. And then all the wisdom you collect through that, then you share\nwith the others in the system, with the other individuals, and as a collective then\nyou kind of converge towards greater wisdom throughout the generation. So in that sense it's optimal. Us humans and orcas\ngot something going on. It works.\n- Oh, yeah. Apex predators. - I just got a megalodon tooth,\nspeaking of apex predators. - Oh, man! - It's... Just imagine the size of that thing. Anyway, how does the brain forget"

      "section": "Why we forget",
      "text": "and how and why does it remember? So maybe some of the mechanisms? You mentioned the hippocampus, what are the different\ncomponents involved here? - So we could think about\nthis on a number of levels. Maybe I'll give you the\nsimplest version first, which is we tend to think of memories as these individual things\nand we can just access them, maybe a little bit like, you\nknow, photos on your phone, or something like that. But in the brain, the way it works is you have this distributed pool of neurons and the\nmemories are kind of shared across different pools of neurons. And so what you have is competition, where sometimes memories\nthat overlap can be fighting against each other, right? So sometimes we forget because that competition\njust wipes things out. Sometimes we forget because there aren't\nthe biological signals, which we can get into, I would promote long-term retention. And lots of times we forget because we can't find the\ncue that sends us back to the right memory. And we need the right cue to\nbe able to activate it, right? So, you know, for instance,\nin a neural network there is no... You wouldn't go and you'd\nsay, \"This is the memory.\" Right? It's like the whole network,\nI mean the whole ecosystem of memories is in the weights\nof the neural network. And in fact you could\nextract entirely new memories depending on how you feed. - You have to have the right\nquery, the right prompt, to access that whatever the\npart you're looking for. - That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And in humans you have\nthis more complex set of ways memory works. There's, as I said, the knowledge, or what you call semantic memory, and then there's these\nmemories for specific events, which we call episodic memory. And so there's different\npieces of the puzzle that require different kinds of cues. So that's a big part of it too, is just this kind of what\nwe call retrieval failure. - You mentioned episodic memory, you mentioned semantic memory. What are the different separations here? What's what working\nmemory, short-term memory, long-term memory, what are the interesting\ncategories of memory? - Yeah. And so memory researchers,\nwe love to cut things up and say, you know, is memory\none thing or is it two things? Is it two things, or is it three things? And so one of the things that... There's value in that, and\nespecially experimental value in terms of being able to dissect things. In the real world, it's all connected. Speaking to your question,\nworking memory is a term that was coined by Alan Baddeley. It's basically thought to be this ability to keep information online in your mind right in front of you at a given time, and to be able to control\nthe flow of that information, to choose what information is relevant, to be able to manipulate it, and so forth. And one of the things that Alan\ndid that was quite brilliant was he said, there's this ability\nto kind of passively store information, you know, see\nthings in your mind's eye, or hear your internal monologue. But, you know, we have that ability to keep information in mind, but then we also have this\nseparate, what he called, a central executive, which is identified a lot\nwith the prefrontal cortex, it's this ability to control\nthe flow of information that's being kept active based\non what it is you're doing. Now a lot of my early\nwork was basically saying that this working memory, which some memory researchers\nwould call short-term memory, is not at all independent\nfrom long-term memory. That is that a lot of executive\nfunction requires learning and you have to have like synaptic change for that to happen. And... But there's also\ntransient forms of memory. So one of the things I've\nbeen getting into lately is the idea that we form\ninternal models of events. The obvious one that I always use is birthday parties, right? So you go to a child's birthday party, once the cake comes out and they start, you just see a candle, you\ncan predict the whole frame, you know, set of events\nthat happens later. And up till that point where\nthe child blows out the candle, you have an internal model in\nyour head of what's going on. And so if you follow people's eyes, it's not actually on what's happening, it's going where the\naction's about to happen. Which is just fascinating, right? So you have this internal model and that's a kind of a\nworking memory product. It's something that you're keeping online that's allowing you to\ninterpret this world around you. Now to build that model though\nyou need to pull out stuff from your general knowledge of the world, which is what we call semantic memory, and then you'd wanna be\nable to pull out memories for specific events that\nhappened in the past, which we call episodic memory. So in a way they're all connected, even though it's different, the things that we're focusing on, and the way we organize\ninformation in the present, which is working memory, will\nplay a big role in determining how we remember that information later, which people typically\ncall long-term memory. - So if you have something\nlike a birthday party, and you've been to many\nbefore, you're gonna load that from disc into\nworking memory, this model, and then you're mostly\noperating on the model. And if it's a new task,\nyou don't have a model so you're more in the data collection? - Yes. One of the fascinating things\nthat we've been studying, and this is, we're not at\nall the first to do this, Jeff Zacks was a big pioneer in this, and I've been working\nwith many other people, Ken Norman, Lila Davachi, NY or Columbia, has done some interesting\nstuff with this, is this idea that we form these internal\nmodels at particular points of high prediction error, or points of, I believe\nalso points of uncertainty, points of surprise, or\nmotivationally significant periods, and those points are when\nit's maximally optimal to encode an episodic memory. So I used to think, \"Oh,\nwell we're just encoding episodic memories constantly,\nboom, boom, boom, boom, boom.\" But think about how much redundancy there is in all that, right? It's just a lot of information\nthat you don't need. But if you capture an episodic memory at the point of maximum uncertainty for the singular experience, right, you're just, it's\nonly gonna happen once. But if you capture it at the\npoint of maximum uncertainty, or maximum surprise, you have the most useful\npoint in your experience that you've grabbed. And what we see is that the hippocampus, and these other networks that are involved in generating these\ninternal models of events, they show a heightened\nperiod of connectivity, or correlated activity,\nduring those breaks between different events,\nwhich we call event boundaries. These are the points where\nyou're like surprised or you cross from one room\nto another, and so forth. And that communication is associated with a bump of activity in the hippocampus and better memory. And so if people have a\nvery good internal model throughout that event you don't need to do much memory processing, you're in a predictive mode, right? And so then at these event\nboundaries you encode and then you retrieve and you're like, \"Okay, wait a minute,\nwhat's going on here? Ranganath's now talking about orcas. What's going on?\" And maybe you have to go back and remember reading my book\nto pull out the episodic memory to make sense of whatever it\nis I'm babbling about, right? And so there's this beautiful dynamics that you can see in the brain\nof these different networks that are coming together\nand then deaffiliating at different points in\ntime that are allowing you to go into these modes. And so to speak to your original\nquestion, to some extent when we're talking about semantic memory, and episodic memory, and working memory, you can think about it as these\nprocesses that are unfolding as these networks kind of\ncome together and pull apart."

      "text": "- Can memory be trained and improved? This beautiful connected\nsystem that you've described, what aspect of it is a mechanism that can be improved through training? - I think improvement, it\ndepends on what your definition of optimal is. So what I say in the book\nis, is that you don't wanna remember more, you wanna remember better, which means focusing on the\nthings that are important. And that's what our\nbrains are designed to do. So if you go back to the\nearliest quantitative studies in memory by Ebbinghaus what\nyou see is that he was trying so hard to memorize\nthis arbitrary nonsense and within a day he lost\nabout 60% of that information. And he was using... He was basically using a\nvery, very generous way of measuring it, right? So as far as we know nobody\nhas managed to violate those basics of having people forget, you know, most of their experiences. So if your expectation is\nthat you should remember everything, and that's\nwhat your optimal is, you're already off because\nthis is not what human brains are designed to do. On the other hand, what\nwe see over and over again is that the brain does... Basically, one of the cool\nthings about the design of the brain is it's always less is more. Less is more, right? It's like, I mean I've seen estimates that the human brain uses\nsomething like 12 to 20 watts, you know, in a day. I mean, that's just nuts, the\nlow power consumption, right? So it's all about reusing information and making the most of\nwhat we already have. And so that's why basically,\nagain, what you see biologically is, you know, neuromodulators for instance, these chemicals in the brain like norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, these are chemicals that are released during moments that tend to\nbe biologically significant: surprise, fear, stress, et cetera. And so these chemicals promote\nlasting plasticity, right? Essentially some mechanisms\nfor which the brain can say prioritize the information\nthat you carry with you into the future. Attention is a big factor as well, our ability to focus our\nattention on what's important. And so there's different schools of thought on training\nattention, for instance. So one of my colleagues, Amishi\nJha, she wrote a book called \"Peak Mind\" and talks about mindfulness as a method for improving\nattention and focus. So she works a lot with military,\nlike Navy SEALs and stuff, to do this kind of work\nwith mindfulness meditation. Adam Gazzaley, another one\nof my friends and colleagues, his work on kind of\ntraining through video games actually as a way of training attention. And so it's not clear to me,\nyou know, one of the challenges though in training is you tend to over fit to the thing that you're\ntrying to optimize, right? So you tend to, if I'm\nlooking at a video game, I can definitely get\nbetter at paying attention in the context of the video game, but do you transfer it\nto the outside world? That's very controversial. - The implication there is\nthat attention is a fundamental component of remembering something, allocating attention to it, and then attention might be\nsomething that you could train. How you allocate attention and how you hold attention on a thing. - I can say that in fact we\ndo in certain ways, right? So if you are an expert in something, you are training attention. So we did this one study\nof expertise in the brain and, you know, so people used to think, let's say if you're a bird\nexpert or something, right? People will go, like if you\nget really into this world of birds, you start to see the differences in your visual cortex is tuned up and it's all about plasticity\nof the visual cortex. And vision researchers love\nto say everything's visual, you know, but... But it's like we did\nthis study of attention and working, or working\nmemory and expertise and one of the things that surprised us were the biggest effects\nas people became experts in identifying these different\nkinds of just crazy objects that we made up, as they\ndeveloped this expertise of being able to identify\nwhat made them different from each other, and\nwhat made them unique, we were actually seeing\nmassive increases in activity in the prefrontal cortex. And this fits with some of\nthe studies of chess experts, and so forth, that it's\nnot so much that you learn the patterns passively,\nyou learn what to look for, you learn what's important\nand what's not, right? And you can see this\nin any kind of expert, professional athlete, they're\nlooking three steps ahead of where they're supposed to be. So that's a kind of a\ntraining of attention. And those are also what you'd\ncall expert memory skills. So if you take the memory athletes, I know that's something\nwe're both interested in. And, you know, so these\nare people who train in these competitions and\nthey'll memorize like a deck of cards in like a really\nshort amount of time. There's a great memory athlete, her name I think is pronounced\nYanjaa Wintersoul, but she... So I think she's got like a\ngiant Instagram following. And so she had this YouTube\nvideo that went viral where she had memorized an\nentire IKEA catalog, right? And so how do people do this? By all accounts from people\nwho become memory athletes, they weren't born with\nsome extraordinary memory, but they practice strategies\nover and over and over again. The strategy that they use for memorizing a particular thing, it\ncan become automatic and you can just deploy\nit in an instant, right? So, again, it's not necessarily gonna... One strategy for learning\nthe order of a deck of cards might not help you for\nsomething else that you need, like, you know, remembering\nyour way around Austin, Texas, but it's gonna be these,\nwhatever you're interested in, you can optimize for that. And that's just a natural\nbyproduct of expertise. - There's certain hacks. There's something called the memory palace that I've played with. I don't know if you're familiar\nwith that whole technique? And it works. It's interesting. So another thing I\nrecommend for people a lot is I use Anki a lot every day. It's a app that does space repetition. So I think medical students, and like students use\nthis a lot to remember a lot of different things. - Oh, yeah. Okay, we can come back\nto this, but yeah, go on. - Sure, it's the whole\nconcept of spaced repetition. You just... When the thing is fresh, you\nkind of have to remind yourself of it a lot, and then over\ntime you can wait a week, a month, a year before you\nhave to recall the thing again. And that way you essentially\nhave something like note cards that you can have tens of\nthousands of and can only spend 30 minutes a day and\nactually be refreshing all of that information,\nall of that knowledge. It's really great. And then for memory palace is a technique that allows you to remember\nthings like the IKEA catalog by placing them visually in a place that you're really familiar with. Like, I'm really familiar\nwith this place so I can put numbers, or facts, or\nwhatever you wanna remember. You can walk along that little palace and it reminds you. It's cool. Like there's stuff like\nthat that I think athletes, memory athletes could use, but I think also regular people can use. One of those things that\nI have to solve for myself is how to remember names. I'm horrible at it. - [Charan] Yeah. - I think it's because when\npeople introduce themselves I have the social anxiety\nof the interaction where I'm like, \"I know I\nshould be remembering that,\" but I'm freaking out internally about social interaction in general and so therefore I forget immediately. So I'm looking for good tricks for that. - So I feel like we've\ngot a lot in common, because when people\nintroduce themselves to me it's almost like I have this\nlike just blank blackout for a moment and then\nI'm just looking at them like, \"What happened?\" And I look away or something. What's wrong with me? - Yeah. - So, I mean, I'm\ntotally with you on this. The reason why it's hard\nis that there's no reason we should be able to remember names, because when you say remembering a name, you're not really remembering a name. Maybe in my case you\nare, but most of the time you're associating a name\nwith a face and an identity. And that's a completely\narbitrary thing, right? I mean, maybe in the olden\ndays somebody named Miller, it's like they're actually making flour or something like that. But, you know, for the most\npart it's like these names are just utterly arbitrary, so you have no thing to latch onto. And so it's not really a thing that our brain does very well is to learn meaningless, arbitrary stuff. So what you need to do is\nbuild connection somehow. Visualize a connection. And sometimes it's obvious,\nor sometimes it's not. I'm trying to think of\na good one for you now, but the first thing I\nthink of is Lex Luthor. But-\n- That's great. - Yeah.\n- 'Cause doesn't Lex Luthor wear a suit, I think? - I know he has a shaved head though. - Yeah.\n- Or he's bald, which you're not. You've got a great head of... I'd trade hair with you any day, but- - Right. - But like, you know, something like that. But if I can come up with something. Like, I could say, \"Okay, so Lex Luthor is this criminal mastermind.\" Then I just imagine you- - We talked about stabbing\nor whatever earlier- - Yeah, yeah, exactly. - So just gotta connect it and that's it. - Yeah, yeah. And I... But I'm serious though that these kinds of weird associations, now I'm building a richer network. I mean, one of the things\nthat I find is if I've... Like you can have somebody's name that's just totally generic,\nlike John Smith or something. Not that... No offense to people with that name. But, you know, if I see a generic name like that, but I've read John\nSmith's papers academically and then I meet John\nSmith at a conference, I can immediately associate\nthat name with that face, 'cause I have this preexisting network to lock everything into, right? And so you can build that network, and that's what the method of loci, or the memory palace\ntechnique is all about, is you have a preexisting\nstructure in your head of like your childhood home, or this mental palace that\nyou've created for yourself, and so now you can put arbitrary pieces of information in different locations in that mental structure of yours, and then you could walk\nthrough the different path and find all the pieces of\ninformation you're looking for. So the method of loci is a great method for just learning arbitrary things because it allows you\nto link them together and get that cue that you need to pop in and find everything, right?"

      "section": "Memory hacks",
      "text": "- We should maybe linger\non this memory palace thing just to make obvious. 'Cause when people were\ndescribing to me a while ago what this is, it seems insane. I just, you literally think of a place like a childhood home, or a home that you're\nreally visually familiar with, and you literally place in that three dimensional\nspace facts, or people, or whatever you wanna remember. And you just walk in your mind\nalong that place visually, and you can remember, remind yourself of the different things. One of the limitations is\nthere is a sequence to it. So I think your brain somehow, you need, you can't just like go upstairs\nright away or something, you have to like walk along the room. So it's really great for\nremembering sequences, but it's also not great for remembering like individual\nfacts out of context. So the full context of the\ntour I think is important. But it's fascinating how the mind is able to do that when you ground these pieces of knowledge into something that you remember well\nalready, especially visually. Fascinating. And you could just do that\nfor any kind of sequence. And I'm sure she used something like this for the, for IKEA catalog,\nsomething of this nature. - Oh, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And I think the principle here\nis, again, I was telling you this idea that memories can\ncompete with each other, right? Well, I like to use this example, and maybe someday I'll regret this, but I've used it a lot recently, is like imagine if this were\nmy desk it could be cluttered with a zillion different things, right? So imagine it's just\ncluttered with a whole bunch of yellow post-it notes and on one of them I put my\nbank password on it, right? Well it's gonna take\nme forever to find it. I might, you know, it's\njust gonna be buried under all these other post-it notes. But if it's like hot\npink it's gonna stand out and I find it really easily, right? So that's one way in which\nif things are distinctive, if you've processed information\nin a very distinctive way, then you can have a\nmemory that's gonna last. And that's very good, for instance, for name-face association. So if I get something\ndistinctive about you, you know that it's like that\nyou've got very short hair and maybe I can make the\nassociation with Lex Luthor that way, or something like that, right? You know? But I get something very specific. That's a great cue. But the other part of it\nis, what if I just organized my notes so that I have\nmy finances in one pile and I have my like reminders, my to-do list in one pile, and so forth. And so I organize them. Well then I know exactly if\nI'm going for my banking, you know, my bank password, I could go to the finance pile, right? So the method of loci works,\nor memory palaces work because they give you a way of organizing. There's a school of thought\nthat says that episodic memory evolved from this like kind of knowledge of space and, you know, basically\nthis primitive abilities to figure out where you are, and so people explain the\nmethod of loci that way. And, you know, whether or\nnot the evolutionary argument is true, the method of\nloci is not at all special. So if you don't, you're\nnot a good visualizer, stories are a good one. So a lot of memory\nathletes will use stories and they'll go... Like if you're memorizing a deck of cards, they have a little code for the different, like the king and the jack\nand the 10 and so forth. And they'll make up a story about things that they're doing, and that'll work. Songs are a great one, right? I mean, it's like, I can still\nremember there's this obscure episode of the TV show, \"Cheers.\" They sing a song about Albania\nthat he uses to memorize all these facts about Albania, and I could still sing that song to you. It's... It is just, I saw it\non a TV show, you know. - So you mentioned spaced repetition, so do you like this process? Maybe can you explain it? - Oh, yeah. If I am trying to memorize something, let's say if I have an hour to memorize as many Spanish words as I can, if I just try to do like half an hour and then later in the\nday I do half an hour, I won't retain that information as long as if I do half an hour today and half an hour one week from now. And so doing that extra\nspacing should help me retain the information better. Now there's a interesting\nboundary condition which is, it depends on when\nyou need that information. So many of us, you know, for\nme, like I can't remember so much from college and\nhigh school 'cause I crammed, 'cause I just did everything\nat the last minute. And sometimes I would literally study like, you know, in the\nhallway right before the test. And that was great\nbecause what would happen is, is I just had that\ninformation right there. And so actually not\nspacing can really help you if you need it very quickly, right? But the problem is, is that\nyou tend to forget it later on. But on the other hand,\nif you space things out, you get a benefit for later on retention. And so there's many\ndifferent explanations. We have a computational model of this, it's currently under revision. But in our computer model, what\nwe say is, is that an easy, maybe a good way of thinking\nabout this is this conversation that you and I are having, it's associated with a particular context,\na particular place in time. And so all these little cues\nthat are in the background, these little guitar\nsculptures that you have, and that big light umbrella thing, right? All these things are part of my memory for what we're talking about, the content. So now later on you're sitting around and you're at home drinking a beer and you're thinking, \"God, what a strange interview that was.\" Right? So now you're trying to remember it, but the context is different. So your current situation doesn't match up with the memory that you pulled up. There's error. There's a mismatch between\nwhat you've pulled up and your current context. And so in our model, what\nyou start to do is you start to erase or alter the parts of the memory that are associated with\na specific place and time, and you heighten the\ninformation about the content. And so if you remember this\ninformation in different times, in different places, it's more accessible at different times in different places, because it's not overfitted, in a AI kind of way of\nthinking about things, not overfitted to one particular context. But that's also why the memories\nthat we call upon the most also feel kind of like they're just things that we read about almost, you don't vividly reimagine them, right? It's like they're just these\nthings that just come to us, like facts, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - And it's a little bit\ndifferent than semantic memory, but it's like basically these\nevents that we have recalled every, you know, over\nand over and over again, we keep updating that memory\nso it's less and less tied to the original experience. But then we have those other ones, which it's like you just get a reminder of that very specific context. You smell something, you\nhear a song, you see a place that you haven't been to in a while and boom, it just comes back to you. And that's the exact opposite\nof what you get with spacing. Right? - That's so fascinating. So with spaced repetition,\none of its powers is that you lose attachment\nto a particular context, but then it loses the intensity\nof the flavor of the memory. - Mm-hmm.\n- That's interesting. That's so interesting. - Yeah. But, you know, at the same\ntime it becomes stronger in the sense that the\ncontent becomes stronger. - Yeah, so it's used\nfor learning languages, for learning facts, for learning, for... But, you know, for that generic semantic information type of memories. - Yeah. And I think this falls into a category, we've done other modeling, one of these is a published study in \"PLOS Computational Biology,\" where we show that another\nway, which is I think related to the spacing effect, is what's\ncalled the testing effect. So the idea is, is that if\nyou're trying to learn words, let's say in Spanish,\nor something like that, and this doesn't have to be\nwords, it could be anything, you test yourself on the words and that act of testing yourself\nhelps you retain it better over time than if you just studied it. Right? And so from traditional learning theories, some learning theories,\nanyway, this seems weird, why would you do better, giving\nyourself this extra error from testing yourself\nrather than just, you know, giving yourself perfect input that's a replica of what it is\nthat you're trying to learn? And I think the reason is, is\nthat you get better retention from that error, that mismatch\nthat we talked about, right? So what's happening in our model, it's actually conceptually\nkind of similar to what happens with back prop in AI, or neural networks. And so the idea is, is that you expose, \"Here's the bad connections, and here's the good connections.\" And so we can keep the\nparts of the cell assembly that are good for the memory and lose the ones that are not so good. But if you don't stress test the memory, you haven't exposed it to the error fully. And so that's why I think this\nis kind of, this is a thing that I come back to over and over again, is that you will retain information better if you're constantly pushing\nyourself to your limit, right? If you are feeling like you're coasting, then you're actually not learning. So if it's like- - Always, so you should\nalways be stress testing the memory system? - Yeah, and feel good about it. You know, even though everyone tells me, \"Oh, my memory's terrible.\" In the moment they're overconfident about what they'll retain later on. So it's fascinating. And so what happens is,\nis when you test yourself, you're like, \"Oh my God,\nI thought I knew that, but I don't.\" And so it can be demoralizing until you get around that and you realize, \"Hey, this is the way that I learn. This is how I learn best.\" It's like if you're trying\nto, you know, star in a movie or something like that, you\ndon't just sit around reading the script, you actually act it out and you're gonna botch those\nlines from time to time. Right? - You know, there's an interesting moment. You probably have experienced this. I remember a good friend\nof mine, Joe Rogan, I was on his podcast and\nwe were randomly talking about soccer, football. Somebody I grew up watching,\nDiego Armando Maradona, one of the greatest soccer\nplayers of all time. And we were talking about\nhim and his career and so on. And Joe asked me if he's still around. Now... And I said, \"Yeah.\" I don't know why I thought, \"Yeah.\" Because that was a perfect\nexample of memories. He passed away. I tweeted about it, how heartbroken I was, all this kind of stuff,\nlike a year before. I know this but in my mind I went back to the thing I've done\nmany times in my head, visualizing some of the epic\nruns he had on goal, and so on. So for me, he's alive. And so I'm... In part of also the\nconversation when you're talking to Joey there's stress and like... The focus is allocated,\nthe attention is allocated in a particular way. But when I walked away I was like, \"In which world was Diego\nMaradona still alive?\" Like in which... 'Cause I was sure- - Yeah.\n- In my head that he was still alive. And it was a... It's a moment that sticks with me. I've had a few like that in my life where it just kinda... Like obvious things just\ndisappear from mind. And it's cool. Like it shows actually\nthe power of the mind, in a positive sense, to erase memories you want erased maybe. But I don't know. I don't know if there's a\ngood explanation for that."

      "text": "- One of the cool things that I found is that some people really\njust revolutionize a field by creating a problem\nthat didn't exist before. It's kinda like why I love science, it's like engineering is like solving other people's problems, and science is about creating problems. And I'm just much more\nlike I want to break things and, you know, create problems. - [Lex] Yeah. - Not necessarily move fast though. But one of my former\nmentors, Marcia Johnson, who in my opinion is one of\nthe greatest memory researchers of all time, she comes up,\nyoung woman in the field, and it's mostly guy field, and she gets into this idea of\nhow do we tell the difference between things that we've imagined and things that we actually remember. How do we tell... I get some mental experience, where did that mental\nexperience come from? Right? And it turns out this is a huge problem because essentially our mental experience of remembering something that happened, our mental experience of\nthinking about something, how do you tell the difference? They're both largely\nconstructions in our head. And so it is very important. And the way that you do it is... I mean, it's not perfect,\nbut the way that we often do it and succeed is by, again,\nusing our prefrontal cortex and really focusing on\nthe sensory information or the place and time and\nthe things that put us back into when this information happened. And if it's something you thought about you're not gonna have\nall of that vivid detail as you do for something\nthat actually happened. But it doesn't work all the time. But that's a big thing\nthat you have to do. But it takes time. It's slow and it's, again, effortful. But that's what you need\nto remember accurately. But what's cool, and I think\nthis is what you alluded to about how that was an\ninteresting experience, is imagination's exactly the opposite. Imagination is basically saying, \"I'm just gonna take all\nthis information from memory, recombine it in different\nways and throw it out there.\" And so for instance, Dan\nSchacter and Donna Addis have done cool work on this. Demis Hassabis did work on this with Eleanor Maguire and UCL. And this goes back actually\nto this guy Frederic Bartlett who is this revolutionary\nmemory researcher. Bartlett, he actually like\nrejected the whole idea of quantifying memory. He said, there's no statistics in my book. He came from this\nanthropology perspective. And, short version of the\nstory is, he just asked people to recall things. You give people stories and\npoem, ask people to recall them. And what he found was people's\nmemories didn't reflect all of the details of\nwhat they were exposed to. And they did reflect a lot more, they were filtered through\nthis lens of prior knowledge, the cultures that they came\nfrom, the beliefs that they had, the things they knew. And so what he concluded was\nthat he called remembering an imaginative construction, meaning that we don't replay the past, we imagine how the past could have been by taking bits and pieces\nthat come up in our heads. And, likewise, he wrote this\nbeautiful paper on imagination saying, when we imagine\nsomething, and create something, we're creating it from\nthese specific experiences that we've had and combining\nit with our general knowledge. But instead of trying to\nfocus it on being accurate and getting out one thing you're\njust ruthlessly recombining things without any,\nyou know, any necessary kind of goal in mind. I mean, or at least that's\none kind of creation. - So imagination is\nfundamentally coupled with memory in both directions? - I think so. I mean, it's not clear\nthat it is in everyone, but one of the things that's\nbeen studied is some patients who have amnesia, for instance,\nthey have brain damage say to the hippocampus and\nif you ask them to imagine things that are not in front of them, like imagine what could happen\nafter I leave this room. Right? They find it very difficult\nto give you a scenario what could happen. Or if they do it would\nbe more stereotype like, \"Yes, this would happen, this would...\" But it's not like they can come up with anything that's very vivid\nand creative in that sense. And it's partly 'cause\nwhen you have amnesia, you're stuck in the present. Because to get a very\ngood model of the future it really helps to have\nepisodic memories to draw upon. Right? And so that's the basic idea. And in fact one of the most\nimpressive things when people started to scan people's brains and ask people to remember past events, what they found was there\nwas this big network of the brain called the\ndefault mode network. It gets a lot of press because it's like thought to be important, it's engaged during mind wandering. And if I ask you to pay\nattention to something, it only comes on when you\nstop paying attention. You know, so people, \"Oh, it's just this kind of,\nyou know, daydreaming network.\" And I thought, this is\njust ridiculous research. Who cares? You know? But then what people found\nwas when people recall episodic memories, this\nnetwork gets active. And so we started to look\ninto it and this network of areas is really closely\nfunctionally interacting with the hippocampus. And so... In fact, some would say the hippocampus is part of this default network. And if you look at brain images of people, or brain maps of activation, so to speak, of people imagining possible scenarios of things that could happen in the future, or even things that couldn't\nreally be very plausible, they look very similar. I mean, you know, to the naked\neye they look almost the same as maps of brain activation\nwhen people remember the past. According to our theory,\nand we've got some data to support this, we've\nbroken up this network in various sub pieces, is that basically it's\nkind of taking apart all of our experiences and\ncreating these little Lego blocks out of them, and then you\ncan put them back together if you have the right\ninstructions to recreate these experiences that you've had, but you could also reassemble\nthem into new pieces to create a model of an event\nthat hasn't happened yet. And that's what we think happens. And when I'm... Our common ground that we're\nestablishing in language requires using those building blocks to put together a model\nof what's going on. - Well there's a good percentage of time I personally live in the imagined world. I think of... I have... I do thought experiments a lot. I, you know, take the\nabsurdity of human life as it stands and play it forward in all kinds of different directions. Sometimes it's rigorous\nthought experiments, sometimes it's fun ones. So I imagine that that has an effect on how I remember things. And I suppose I have to\nbe a little bit careful to make sure stuff happened versus stuff that I\njust imagined happened. And this also, I mean,\nsome of my best friends are characters inside books\nthat never even existed. And I'm, you know, there's some degree to which they actually exist in my mind. Like these characters\nexist, authors exist, Dostoevsky exists, but\nalso \"Brothers Karamazov.\" - I love that book. - Yeah.\n- It's one of the few books I've read. (both laughing) One of the few literature\nbooks that I've read, I should say. I read a lot in school\nthat I don't remember, but \"Brothers Karamazov\" was good. - But they exist. - They exist, and I have almost kind of like conversations with them. It's interesting. It's interesting to allow your brain to kind of play with ideas of the past, of the imagined, and see it all as one. - Yeah, there was actually\nthis famous mnemonist, he is kind of like back\nthen the equivalent of a memory athlete, except he would go to shows and do this. That was described by this\nreally famous neuropsychologist from Russia named Luria. And so this guy was named\nSolomon Shereshevsky and he had this condition\ncalled synesthesia that basically created\nthese weird associations between different senses that\nnormally wouldn't go together. So that gave him this\nincredibly vivid imagination that he would use to basically imagine all sorts of things that\nhe would need to memorize. And he would just\nimagine, like just create these incredibly detailed\nthings in his head that allowed him to\nmemorize all sorts of stuff. But it also really haunted\nhim, by some reports, that basically it was\nlike he was at some point, you know, and again who knows\nthe drinking was part of this, but at some point had\ntrouble differentiating his imagination from reality. Right? And this is interesting\nbecause it's like... I mean that's what\npsychosis is in some ways, is you, you know, first of\nall you're just learning connections from prediction errors that you probably shouldn't learn. And the other part of it is,\nis that your internal signals are being confused with actual\nthings in the outside world. Right? - Well that's why a lot of this stuff is both feature and bug. It's a double-edged sword. - Yeah, I mean it might be why\nthere's such an interesting relationship between genius and psychosis. - Yeah, maybe they're just\ntwo sides of the same coin. Humans are fascinating, aren't they? - I think so. Sometimes scary, but mostly fascinating."

      "text": "- Can we just talk about\nmemory sport a little longer? There's something called\nthe USA Memory Championship. - [Charan] Mm. - Like what are these athletes... Like what does it mean to\nbe like elite level at this? Have you interacted with any of them? Or reading about them\nwhat have you learned about these folks? - There's a guy named Henry Roediger who's studying these guys. And there's actually a book by Joshua Foer called\n\"Moonwalking with Einstein,\" where he talks about... He actually, as part of\nthis book, just decided to become a memory athlete. They often have these life events that make them go, \"Hey,\nwhy don't I do this?\" So there was a guy named Scott\nHagwood, who I write about, who thought that he was... He was getting chemo for\ncancer and so he decided like, because the chemo,\nthere's a well-known thing called chemo brain where people\nbecome like, they just lose a lot of their sharpness. And so he wanted to fight that by learning these memory skills. So he bought a book, and\nthis is the story you hear in a lot of memory\nathletes is they buy a book by other memory athletes. - Yeah.\n- Or other memory experts, so to speak, and they\njust learn those skills and practice them over and over again. They start by winning bets and so forth, and then they go into these competitions. And the competitions are\ntypically things like memorizing long strings of numbers, or\nmemorizing, you know, orders of cards and so forth. So there tend to be pretty\narbitrary things, not like things that would be able, you'd be able to bring a lot of prior knowledge. But they build the skills that you need to memorize arbitrary things. - Yeah, that's fascinating. I've gotten a chance to work with something called N-Back tasks. So there's all these kinds of tasks- - [Charan] Oh, yeah. - Memory recall tasks that are used to kinda load up the quote\nunquote working memory. - [Charan] Yeah, yeah. - And to see a psychologist\nused it to test all kinds of stuff, like to see how well you're good at multitasking. We used it in particular\nfor the task of driving. Like if we fill up your brain\nwith intensive working memory tasks, how good are you\nat also not crashing? That kind of stuff. So it's fascinating. But, again, those tasks are arbitrary and they're usually about\nrecalling a sequence of numbers in some kind\nof semi complex way. Are you, do you have any favorite tasks of this nature in your own studies? - I've really been most excited about going in the opposite direction and using things that are\nmore and more naturalistic. - [Lex] Mm. - And the reason is is\nthat we've really moved in that direction because what we found is, is that memory works\nvery, very differently when you study it, when\nyou study memory in the way that people typically remember. And so it goes into a\nmuch more predictive mode and you have these event\nboundaries, for instance, and you have... But a lot of what happens is\nthis kind of fascinating mix that we've been talking about, a mix of interpretations and\nimagination with perception. And so... And the new direction we're\ngoing in is understanding navigation in our memory for places. And the reason is, is\nthat there's a lot of work that's done in rats,\nwhich is very good work. They have a rat and they put it in a box and the rat goes, chases cheese in a box and you'll find cells in the hippocampus that fire when a rat is in\ndifferent places in the box. And so the conventional wisdom\nis that the hippocampus forms this map of the box. And I think that probably may happen when you have like absolutely\nno knowledge of the world. Right? But I think one of the cool\nthings about human memory is we can bring to bear\nour past experiences to economically learn new ones. And so, for instance, if\nyou learn a map of an IKEA, let's say if I go to the IKEA in Austin, I'm sure there's one here, I\nprobably could go to this IKEA and find my way to the, you\nknow, where the wine glasses are without having to even think about it because it's got a very similar layout. Even though IKEA's a\nnightmare to get around once I learned my local IKEA,\nI can use that map everywhere. Why form a brand new one for a new place? And so that kind of ability\nto reuse information really comes into play when we look at things that are, you know,\nmore naturalistic tasks. And another thing that\nwe're really interested in is this idea of like what if instead of basically mapping out\nevery coordinate in a space you form a pretty economical graph that connects basically the\nmajor landmarks together and being able to use that\nas, you know, emphasizing the things that are most important, the places that you go for food, and the places that are landmarks\nthat help you get around, and then filling in the\nblanks for the rest. Because I really believe\nthat cognitive maps, or mental maps, of the world, just like our memories for events, are not photographic. I think they're this combination of actual verifiable details and then a lot of inference that you make. - So what have you learned about this kind of\nspatial mapping of places? How do people represent locations? - There's a lot of variability. I think that... And there's a lot of disagreement about how people represent locations. In a world of GPS and\nphysical maps people can learn it from like basically what\nthey call a survey perspective, being able to see everything. And so that's one way in\nwhich humans can do it that's a little bit different. There's one way which\nwe can memorize routes. Like I know how to get from here to... Let's say if I knew... Walk here from my hotel, I\ncould just rigidly follow that route back, right? And there's another more integrative way which would be what's\ncalled a cognitive map, which would be kind of a sense\nof how everything relates to each other. And so there's lots of people\nwho believe that these maps that we have in our head are\nisomorphic with the world that are like these literal coordinates that follow Euclidean space. And as you know, Euclidean\nmathematics is very constrained. Right? And I think that we are\nactually much more generative in our maps of space so that we do have these bits and pieces. And we've got a small task as... It's right now, not yet... Like we need to do some work\non it for further analyses but one of the things we're looking at is these signals called\nripples in the hippocampus, which are these bursts\nof activity that you see that are synchronized with\nareas in the neocortex, in the default network actually. And so what we find is,\nis that those ripples seem to increase at\nnavigationally important points when you're making a decision,\nor when you reach a goal. This speaks to the emotion thing, right? Because if you have limited choices, if I'm walking down a street I could really just get a\nmental map of the neighborhood with a more minimal kind\nof thing by just saying, \"Here's the intersections and\nhere's the directions I take to get in between them.\" And what we found in\ngeneral in our MRI studies is basically the more people\ncan reduce the problem, whether it's space, or any kind\nof decision making problem, the less the hippocampus encodes. It really is very economical\ntowards the points of most highest information\ncontent and value. - So can you describe the\nencoding, and the hippocampus, and the ripples you were talking about? What's the signal in\nwhich we see the ripples? - Yeah, so this is really interesting. There are these oscillations, right? So there's these waves\nthat you basically see and these waves are points\nof very high excitability and low excitability. And, at least during... They happen actually\nduring slow wave sleep too. So the deepest stages of sleep\nwhen you're just zonked out. Right? You see these very slow waves\nwhere it's like very excitable and then very unexcitable. It goes up and down. And on top of them you'll see these little sharp wave ripples. And when there's a\nripple in the hippocampus you tend to see a sequence\nof cells that resemble a sequence of cells that\nfire when, you know, an animal's actually doing\nsomething in the world. So it almost is like a little... People call it replay. I think it's a little bit,\nI don't like that term, but it's basically a little\nbit of a compressed play of the sequence of activity in the brain that was taking place earlier. And during those moments\nthere's a little window of communication between the hippocampus and these areas in the neocortex. And so that, I think, helps\nyou form new memories, but it also helps you,\nI think, stabilize them but also really connect different\nthings together in memory and allows you to build bridges\nbetween different events that you've had. And so this is one of\nour theories of sleep and its real role in helping\nyou see the connections between different events\nthat you've experienced. - Oh, so during sleep is when\nthe connections are formed? - The connections\nbetween different events. - Yeah.\n- Right? So it's like you see me\nnow, you see me next week, you see me a month\nlater, you start to build a little internal model of how I behave and, you know, what to expect of me. And we think sleep, one of\nthe things it allows you to do is figure out those connections,\nand connect the dots, and find the signal in the noise."

      "section": "Science of memory",
      "text": "- So you mentioned FMRI, what is it and how is it used in studying memory? - This is actually the reason why I got into this whole field of science is when I was in grad school FMRI was just really taking off as a technique for studying brain activity. And what's beautiful\nabout it is you can study the whole human brain and,\nthere's lots of limits to it, but you can basically do it in a person without sticking anything\ninto their brains. And very non-invasive. I mean for me being in an MRI scanner is like being in the\nwomb, I just fall asleep. If I'm not being asked to do\nanything I get very sleepy. You know? But you can have people watch movies while they're being scanned, or you can have them do tests of memory, like giving them words\nand so forth to memorize. But what MRI is itself\nis just this technique where you put people in a\nvery high magnetic field. Typical ones we would\nuse would be 3 Tesla, to give you an idea. So a 3 Tesla magnet, you put\nsomebody in and what happens is you get this very weak but, you know, measurable\nmagnetization in the brain and then you apply a\nradio frequency pulse, which is basically a different\nelectromagnetic field. And so you're basically using water, the water molecules in the\nbrain, as a tracer, so to speak. And part of it in FMRI is the fact that these magnetic fields that you mess with by manipulating these\nradio frequency pulses, and the static field, and you\nhave things called gradients which change the strength\nof the magnetic field in different parts of the head. So they're all... We tweak them in different ways, but the basic idea that we use an FMRI is that blood is flowing to the brain and when you have blood\nthat doesn't have oxygen on it, it's a little bit more magnetizable than blood that does. 'Cause you have hemoglobin\nthat carries the oxygen, the iron, basically, in the\nblood that makes it red. And so that hemoglobin,\nwhen it's deoxygenated, actually has different\nmagnetic field properties than when it has oxygen. And it turns out when you have\nan increase in local activity in some part of the brain\nthe blood flows there and as a result you get\na lower concentration of hemoglobin that is not oxygenated and then that gives you more signal. So I gave you a... I think I sent you a\nGIF, as you like to say. - Yeah, we had off record intense argument about if it's pronounced\nGIF or GIF, but that's... We shall set that aside as friends. - We could have called it a\nstern rebuke perhaps, but... - Rebuke, yeah. I drew a hard line. It is true the creator of\nGIF said it's pronounced GIF, but that's the only person\nthat pronounces it GIF. Anyway, yes, you sent a GIF of... - This would be basically a\nwhole a movie of FMRI data. And so when you look at it,\nit's not very impressive, it looks like these like very\npixelated maps of the brain, but it's mostly kinda like white. But these tiny changes in the\nintensity of those signals, that you probably wouldn't\nbe able to visually perceive, like about 1% can be statistically very, very large effects for us. And that allows us to see,\n\"Hey, there's an increase in activity in some part of the brain when I'm doing some task, like trying to remember something.\" And I can use those\nchanges to even predict, \"Is a person going to\nremember this later or not?\" And the coolest thing that\npeople have done is to decode what people are remembering\nfrom the patterns of activity from, 'cause\nmaybe when I'm remembering this thing, like I'm remembering\nthe house where I grew up, I might have one pixel that's\nbright in the hippocampus and one that's dark, and if I'm remembering, you\nknow, something more like the car that I used to\ndrive when I was 16, I might see the opposite pattern, where a different pixel's bright. And so all that little stuff\nthat we used to think of noise, we can now think of almost like a QR code for memory, so to speak. Where different memories have\na different little pattern of bright pixels and dark pixels. And so this really\nrevolutionized my research. So there's fancy research out\nthere where people really... I mean not even that, I\nmean by your standards this would be stone age, but, you know, applying\nmachine learning techniques to do decoding and so forth. And now there's a lot of\nforward encoding models and you can go to town\nwith this stuff, right? And I'm much more old school,\nof designing experiments where you basically say,\n\"Okay, here's a whole web of memories that overlap\nin some way, shape or form. Do memories that occurred\nin the same place, have a similar QR code? And do memories that\noccurred in different places have a different QR code?\" And you can just use things\nlike correlation coefficients or cosign distance to\nmeasure that stuff, right? Super simple, right? And so what happens is\nyou can start to get a whole state space of how a brain area is indexing all these different memories. It's super fascinating because what we could see is\nthis little like separation between how certain brain\nareas are processing memory for who was there, and other brain areas of processing information\nabout where it occurred, or the situation that's kind of unfolding. And some are giving you\ninformation about what are my goals that are involved and so forth. And so... And the hippocampus is just\nputting it all together into these unique things\nthat just are about when and where it happened. - So there's a separation\nbetween spatial information concepts, like literally there's distinct, as you said, QR codes for these? - So to speak. Let me try a different analogy too, that might be more accessible for people, which would be like, you've got a folder on your computer, right? I open it up, there's\na bunch of files there. I can sort those files by,\nyou know, alphabetical order. And now things that\nboth start with letter A are lumped together, and things that start with Z\nversus A are far apart, right? And so that is one way\nof organizing the folder. But I could do it by date, and if I do it by date\nthings that were created close together in time are close and things that are far\napart in time are far. So every... Like you can think of how a brain area, or a network of areas,\ncontributes to memory by looking at what the sorting scheme is. And these QR codes that\nwe're talking about, that you get from FMRI,\nallow you to do that. And you can do the same\nthing if you're recording from massive populations\nof neurons in an animal and you can do it for\nrecording local potentials in the brain. You know, so little waves\nof activity in, let's say, a human who has epilepsy and they stick electrodes in their brain, try to find the seizures. So that's some of the\nwork that we're doing now. But all these techniques\nbasically allow you to say, \"Hey, what's the sorting scheme?\" And so we've found that\nsome networks of the brain sort information in memory\naccording to who was there. So I might have... Like we've actually shown in\none of my favorite studies of all time that was done by\na former postdoc, Zach Raya, and Zach did the study\nwhere we had a bunch of movies with different people in my labs that are two different people, and you filmed them at two different cafes and two different supermarkets. And what you could show is\nin one particular network you could find the same\nkind of pattern of activity, more or less, a very, very\nsimilar pattern of activity, every time I saw Alex\nin one of these movies, no matter where he was, right? And I could see another one\nthat was like a common pattern that happened every time I saw this particular supermarket\nnugget, you know? And so... And it didn't matter whether\nyou're watching a movie or whether you're recalling the movie, it was the same kind of\npattern that comes up, right? - That's so fascinating.\n- It was fascinating. And so now you have those building blocks for assembling a model of\nwhat's happening in the present, imagining what could happen and remembering things very economically from putting together all these pieces so that all the hippocampus has to do is get the right kind of blueprint for how to put together\nall these building blocks. - These are all like beautiful\nhints at a super interesting system that makes me\nwonder on the other side of it how to build it. But it's like, it's fascinating. Like the way it does the encoding is really, really fascinating. Or I guess the symptoms,\nthe results of that encoding are fascinating to study from this. Just as a small tangent, you mentioned sort of the measuring local potentials with electrodes versus FMRI. - [Charan] Oh, yeah. - What are some interesting\nlike limitations, possibilities of FMRI? Maybe... The way you explain it is like brilliant, with blood and detecting the activations, or the excitation, because\nblood flows to that area. What's like the latency of that? Like what's the blood\ndynamics in the brain that... - [Charan] Yeah, yeah. - Like how quickly can it... How quickly can the tasks change\nand all that kind of stuff? - Yeah, I mean it's very slow. To the brain 50 milliseconds\nis like, you know, like it's an eternity. Like maybe not 50, but, you\nknow, maybe like, you know, let's say half a second, 500 milliseconds, just so much back and forth\nstuff happens in the brain in that time, right? So in FMRI you can measure\nthese magnetic field responses about six seconds after\nthat burst of activity would take place. All these things, it's like,\nis it a feature or is it a bug? Right? So one of the interesting\nthings that's been discovered about FMRI is it's not so\ntightly related to the spiking of the neurons. So we tend to think of the\ncomputation, so to speak, as being driven by spikes. Meaning like there's just a burst of, it's either on or it's off, and the neurons like going up or down. But sometimes what you\ncan have is these states where the neuron becomes a\nlittle bit more excitable or less excitable. And so FMRI is very sensitive to those changes in excitability. Actually one of the\nfascinating things about FMRI is where does that... How is it we go from neural activity to, you know, essentially\nblood flow to oxygen? You know, all this stuff. It's such a long chain of, you know, going from neural activity to magnetic fields. And one of the theories that's out there is, you know, most of\nthe cells in the brain are not neurons, they're\nactually these support cells called glial cells, and\none big one is astrocytes, and they play this big role in regulating, you know, kind of being a\nmiddle man, so to speak, with the neurons. So if you, for instance,\nlike one neuron's talking to another, you release a neurotransmitter like let's say glutamate, and that gets another\nneuron starts getting active after you release in the gap between the two neurons\ncalled the synapse. So what's interesting is if\nyou leave that, you know, imagine you're just flooded\nwith this like liquid in there, right? If you leave it in there too long you just excite the other neuron too much and you can start to basically\nget seizure activity. You don't want this. So you gotta suck it up. And so actually what\nhappens is these astrocytes, one of their functions is\nto suck up the glutamate from the synapse and\nthat is a massively... And then break it down,\nand then feed it back into the neurons so that you can reuse it. But that cycling is actually\nvery energy intensive. And what's interesting is, at\nleast according to one theory, they need to work so\nquickly that they're working on metabolizing the glucose that comes in without using oxygen. Kind of like anaerobic metabolism. So they're not using oxygen as fast as they are using glucose. So what we're really seeing\nin some ways maybe, in FMRI, not the neurons themselves being active but rather the astrocytes\nwhich are meeting the metabolic demands of the process of\nkeeping the whole system going. - It does seem to be\nthat FMRI is a good way to study activation. So with these astrocytes,\neven though there's a latency, it's pretty reliably\ncoupled to the activations. - Oh, well this gets me to\nthe other part about my- - [Lex] Yeah. - So now let's say for instance, if I'm just kind of\nlike I'm talking to you, but I'm kind of paying attention\nto your cowboy hat, right? So I'm looking off to the... Or I'm thinking about the right, even if I'm not looking at it. What you'd see is, is that there would be this little elevation in activity in areas in the visual cortex, you know, which process vision,\naround that point in space. Okay? So if then something happened, like, you know, a sudden a light flashed in that part of, you know, right in front of your cowboy hat, I would\nhave a bigger response to it. But what you see in\nFMRI is even if I'm not, even if I don't see that flash of light, there's a lot of activity\nthat I can measure because you're kind of\nkeeping it excitable. And that in and of itself,\neven though I'm not seeing anything there that's\nparticularly interesting there's still this increase in activity. And so it's more sensitive with FMRI. So there... Is that a feature or is it a bug? You know, some people, people\nwho study spikes in neurons would say, \"Well that's\nterrible, we don't want that.\" You know, likewise it's\nslow, and that's terrible for measuring things that are very fast. But one of the things\nthat we found in our work was when we give people movies and when we give people\nstories to listen to a lot of the action is in\nthe very, very slow stuff. Because if you're thinking\nabout like a story, let's say you're listening\nto a podcast or something, you're listening to the \"Lex\nFridman Podcast,\" right? You're putting this stuff together and building this internal\nmodel over several seconds, which is basically we\nfilter that out when we look at electrical activity in the brain, because we're interested\nin this millisecond scale. It's almost massive amounts\nof information, right? So the way I see it is every technique gives you a little limited\nwindow into what's going on. FMRI has huge problems. You know, people lie down in the scanner, there's parts of the brain where you... I'll show you in some of\nthese images where you'll see kind of gaping holes because there's... You can't keep the magnetic\nfield stable in those spots. You'll see parts where\nit's like there's a vein and so it just produces big increases and decreases in signal. Or respiration that causes these changes. There's lots of artifacts\nand stuff like that. You know, every technique has its limits. If I'm lying down in an MRI\nscanner, I'm lying down, I'm not interacting\nwith you in the same way that I would in the real world. But at the same time I'm getting data that I might not be able to get otherwise. And so different techniques give you different kinds of advantages."

      "section": "Discoveries",
      "text": "- What kind of big scientific\ndiscoveries, maybe the flavor of discoveries, have been\ndone throughout the history of the science of memory,\nthe studying of memory? What kind of things have\nbeen like understood? - Oh, there's so many. It's really so hard to summarize it. I mean I think it's funny because it's like when you're in the field you can get kind of\nblase about this stuff. But then once I started to\nwrite the book I was like, \"Oh my God, this is really interesting. How did we do all this stuff?\" I would say that some of the... I mean, you know, from the\nfirst studies just showing how much we forget is very important. Showing how much schemas, which\nis our organized knowledge about the world, increase our ability to remember information. Just massively increases it. Our studies of expertise,\nshowing how experts like chess experts can memorize so much in such a short amount of time because of the schemas\nthey have for chess. But then also showing that those lead to all sorts of distortions in memory. The discovery that the act of remembering can change the memory,\nit can strengthen it, but it can also distort it\nif you get misinformation at the time. And it can also strengthen\nor weaken other memories that you didn't even recall. So just this whole idea of\nmemory as an ecosystem, I think, was a big discovery. I could go on. This idea of like breaking\nup our continuous experience into these discreet events, I\nthink was a major discovery. - So the discreetness of\nour encoding of events? - Maybe, yeah. I mean, you know, and again,\nthere's controversial ideas about this, right? But it's like, yeah, this idea that... And this gets back to just\nthis common experience of you walk into the\nkitchen and you're like, \"Why am I here?\" And you just end up grabbing\nsome food from the fridge and then you go back and you're\nlike, \"Oh, wait a minute, I left my watch in the kitchen. That's what I was looking for.\" And so what happens is, is that you have a little internal model of where you are, what you're thinking about, and when you cross from\none room to another those models get updated. And so now when you're in the\nkitchen you have to go back and mentally time travel\nback to this earlier point to remember what it was\nthat you went there for. And so these event boundaries... Turns out, like in our research, and, again, I don't wanna make\nit sound like we've figured out everything, but in our\nresearch, one of the things that we found is, is that\nbasically as people get older, the activity in the hippocampus\nat these event boundaries tends to go down. But independent of age,\nif I give you outside of the scanner, you're\ndone with the scanner, I just scan you while\nyou're watching a movie, you just watch it, you\ncome out, I give you a test of memory for stories, what happens is you find\nthis incredible correlation between the activity in the hippocampus at these singular points in time, these event boundaries, and your ability to just remember a story outside of the scanner later on. So it's marking this\nability to encode memories, just these little snippets\nof neural activity. So I think that's a big one. There's all sorts of work in animal models that I can get into, you know, sleep. I think there's so much interesting stuff that's being discovered\nin sleep right now. Being able to just record from\nlarge populations of cells and then be able to relate that. You know, one, I think the coolest thing, gets back to this QR code thing, because like what we can do\nnow is like I can take FMRI data while you're watching a movie... Or let's do better than that. Let me get FMRI data\nwhile you use a joystick to move around in virtual reality. You're in the metaverse, whatever, right? But it's kind of a crappy metaverse 'cause there's always so\nmuch metaverse you can do in an MRI scanner. So you're doing this\ncrappy metaverse thing. So now I can take a rat,\nrecord from his hippocampus and prefrontal cortex,\nand all these areas, with these really new electrodes and get massive amounts of data and have it move around on a\ntrack ball in virtual reality in the same metaverse that I did and record that rats activity. I can get a person with epilepsy, who we have electrodes\nin their brain anyway to try to figure out where\nthe seizures are coming from, and if it's a healthy part of the brain record from that person, right? And I can get a computational model. And one of the brand new\nmembers in my lab, Tyler Bonnen, is just doing some great stuff. He relates computer vision models and looks at the weaknesses\nof computer vision models and relates it to what\nthe brain does well. - [Lex] Mm, nice. - And so you can actually\ntake a ground truth, you know, code for the\nmetaverse, basically, And you can feed in\nthe visual information, let's say the sensory information, or whatever, that's coming\nin to a computational model that's designed to take\nreal world inputs, right? And you could basically\ntie them all together by virtue of the state\nspaces that you're measuring in neural activity in\nthese different formats, and these different species, And in the computational\nmodel, which is just... I just find that mind blowing. You could do different kinds\nof analyses on language and basically come up with just like the, basically it's the guts of LLMs, right? You have, you could do\nanalyses on language and you could do analyses on,\nyou know, sentiment analysis of emotions and so forth. Put all the stuff together. I mean, it's almost too much. But if you do it right, and you\ndo it in a theory driven way as opposed to just throwing\nall the data at the wall and see what sticks, I mean that to me is just\nexceptionally powerful. - So you can take FMRI\ndata in across species and across different types of humans, or conditions of humans and,\nwhat, find construct models that help you find the commonalities, or like the core thing that\nmakes somebody navigate through the metaverse, for example? - Yeah, yeah. I mean more or less. I mean there's a lot of\ndetails but yes, I think... And not just FMRI, but you can relate it to, like I said, recordings from large\npopulations of neurons that could be taken in a human or even in a non-human animal, that is, you know, where you think it's an anatomical homolog. So that's just mind blowing to me. - What's the similarities\nin humans and mice? (Charan laughing) - I love it.\n- That's what The Smashing Pumpkins, \"We're\nall just rats in a cage.\" Is that Smashing Pumpkins? - \"Despite all of your rage.\" - Is that Smashing Pumpkins? I think, or all- - Despite all of your rage at GIFs, you're still just rat in a cage. - Oh, yeah. All right, good callback. Anyway.\n- It is a good callback. See these memory retrieval\nexercise I'm doing are actually helping you\nbuild a lasting memory of this conversation. - And it's strengthening the\npic, the visual thing I have of you with James Brown on stage. It's just becoming stronger\nand stronger by the second. Anyway-\n- The hot tub. (both laughing) - But animal studies work here as well? - Yeah, yeah. So, okay, so let's go to the... So I think recent, I've got,\nyou know, great colleagues who I talk to who study memory in mice, you know, and there's some... One of the valuable things in those models is you can study neural circuits in an enormously targeted way because you could do these\ngenetic studies, for instance, where you can manipulate\nlike particular groups of neurons and it's just\ngetting more and more targeted, to the point where you\ncan actually turn on a particular kind of\nmemory just by activating a particular set of\nneurons that was active during an experience. Right? So there's a lot of conservation of some of these neural\ncircuits across, you know, evolution in mammals for instance. And then, you know, some\npeople would even say that there's genetic\nmechanisms for learning that are conservative even\ngoing back far, far before. But let's go back to the mice\nand humans question, right? There's a lot of differences. So for one thing, the sensory\ninformation is very different. Mice and rats explore the world largely through smelling, olfaction, but they also have vision\nthat's kind of designed to kind of catch death from above. So it's like a very big view of the world. And we move our eyes around in a way that focuses on particular spots in space where you get very high resolution from a very limited set of spots in space. So that makes us very\ndifferent in that way. We also have all these other\nstructures as social animals that allow us to respond differently. There's language, there's\nlike, you know, so you name it, there's obviously gobs of differences. Humans aren't just giant rats, there's much more complexity to us. Timescales are very important. So primate brains and human\nbrains are especially good at integrating and and\nholding on to information across longer and longer periods of time. Right? And and also, you know,\nfinally it's like our history of training data, so to\nspeak, is very, very different than, you know, I mean a\nhuman's world is very different than a wild mouse's world. And a lab mouse's world is\nextraordinarily impoverished relative to an adult human. You know? - But still, what can you\nunderstand by studying mice? I mean just basic, almost\nbehavioral stuff about memory? - Well yes, but that's\nvery important, right? So you can understand for\ninstance, how do neurons talk to each other? That's a really big, big question. Neural computation in and of itself... You'd think it's the most\nsimple question, right? Not at all. I mean it's a big, big question and understanding how two\nparts of the brain interact, meaning that it's not\njust one area speaking, it's not like, you know,\nit's not like Twitter where one area of the brain's shouting and then another area of the\nbrain's just stuck listening to this crap. It's like they're actually interacting on the millisecond scale, right? How does that happen,\nand how do you regulate those interactions, these\ndynamic, you know, interactions? We're still figuring that out. But that's gonna be coming\nlargely from model systems that are easier to understand. You can do manipulations\nlike drug manipulations to manipulate circuits and, you know, use viruses, and so forth, and lasers to turn on circuits that you just can't do in humans. So I think there's a lot that\ncan be learned from mice, there's a lot that can be\nlearned from non-human primates, and then there's a lot that\nyou need to learn from humans. And I think, unfortunately,\nsome of the people in the National Institutes\nof Health think you can learn everything from the mouse. Like why study memory in\nhumans when I could study learning in a mouse? And just like, oh my god,\nI'm gonna get my funding from somewhere else. So... - Well let me ask you some\nrandom, fascinating questions. - [Charan] Yeah, sure."

      "section": "Deja vu",
      "text": "- How does deja vu work? - So deja vu is, it's actually\none of these things I think that some of the surveys\nsuggest that like 75% of people report having\na deja vu experience one time or another. I don't know where that came from but I've polled people in my class and most of them say\nthey've experienced deja vu. It's this kind of sense that\nI've experienced this moment sometime before, I've been here before. And actually there's all\nsorts of variants of this. The French have all sorts of names for various versions of this. (speaking in French) I dunno, whatever, it's like\nall these different vus. - [Lex] Yeah. - But deja vu is the sense that it can be like an almost disturbing,\nintense sense of familiarity. So there was a researcher\nnamed Wilder Penfield. Actually, this goes back even earlier, to some of the earliest... Like Hughlings Jackson was\nthis neurologist who did a lot of the early\ncharacterizations of epilepsy. And one of the things he\nnotices in epilepsy patients, some group of them, right\nbefore they would get a seizure, they would have this\nintense sense of deja vu. So it's this artificial\nsense of familiarity, it's a sense of having a\nmemory that's not there. Right? And so what was happening was\nthere was electrical activity in certain parts of these brains\nand so this guy, Penfield, later on, when he was trying to look for how do we map out\nthe brain to figure out which parts we wanna remove\nand which parts don't we, he would stimulate parts of\nthe temporal lobes of the brain and find you could elicit\nthe sense of deja vu. Sometimes you'd actually get a memory, that a person would re-experience, just from electrically\nstimulating some parts. Sometimes though they would\njust have this intense feeling of being somewhere before. And so one theory which I really like is, is that in higher\norder areas of the brain that are integrating for\nmany, many different, you know, sources of input what happens is, is that they're tuning themselves up every time you process\na similar input, right? And so that allows you to just get this kind of affluent sense\nthat I'm very familiar, you're very familiar\nwith this place, right? And so just being here, you're not going to be moving your eyes all over the place 'cause you kind of have an\nidea of where everything is. And that fluency gives you\na sense of like, I'm here. Now I wake up in my hotel room and I have this very unfamiliar\nsense of where I am, right? But, you know, there's a\ngreat set of studies done by Anne Cleary at Colorado State where she created these\nvirtual reality environments. And we'll go back to the metaverse. Imagine you go through\na virtual museum, right? And then she would put\npeople in virtual reality and have them go through a virtual arcade. But the map of the two\nplaces was exactly the same, she just put different skins on them so one looks different than the other, but they've got same landmarks and same places, same\nobjects and everything. But carpeting, colors, theme,\neverything's different. People will often not\nhave any conscious idea that the two are the same, but they could report this\nvery intense sense of deja vu. So it's like a partial\nmatch that's soliciting this kind of a sense of familiarity. And that's why, you know, in\npatients who have epilepsy that affects memory, you\nget this artificial sense of familiarity that happens. And so we think that... And, again, this is just\none theory amongst many, but we think we get a\nlittle bit of that feeling, it's not enough to\nnecessarily give you deja vu, even for very mundane things, right? So it's like if I tell\nyou the word rutabaga, your brain's gonna work a\nlittle bit harder to catch it than if I give you word like apple. Right? And that's 'cause you hear apple a lot, so your brain's very tuned\nup to process it efficiently. But rutabaga takes a little\nbit longer, and more intense. And you can actually see a\ndifference in brain activity in areas in the temporal\nlobe when you hear a word just based on how frequent it\nis in the English language. So- - [Lex] That's fascinating. - We think it's tied to this basic... It's a basically a\nbyproduct of our mechanism of just learning, doing this\nerror driven learning as we go through life to become better and better and better to process things\nmore and more efficiently. - So I guess deja vu was\njust thinking extra elevated, the stuff coming together, firing for this artificial memory\nas if it's the real memory. I mean, why does it feel so intense? - Well, it doesn't happen all the time, but I think what may be\nhappening is it's such a... It's a partial match to\nsomething that we have and it's not enough to trigger\nthat sense of, you know, that ability to pull\ntogether all the pieces but it's a close enough match\nto give you that intense sense of familiarity without the recollection of exactly what happened when. - But it's also like a\nspatial temporal familiarity. So like it's also in time. Like there's a weird blending\nof time that happens. And we'll probably talk about time, 'cause I think that's a\nreally interesting idea. - Yeah.\n- How time relates to memory. But you also kind of..."

      "section": "False memories",
      "text": "Artificial memory brings to\nmind this idea of false memories that comes in all kinds of contexts. But how do false memories form? - Well I like to say there's\nno such thing as true or false memories, right? It's like Johnny Rotten\nfrom the Sex Pistols, he had a saying that's like, \"I don't believe in false memories anymore than I believe in false songs.\" Right? It's like... And so the basic idea is is\nthat we have these memories that reflect bits and\npieces of what happened as well as our inferences\nand theories, right? So I'm a scientist and I collect data, but I use theories to\nmake sense of that data. And so a memory is kind of\na mix of all these things. So where memories can go off the deep end and become what we would call conventionally as false memories are sometimes little distortions where we filled in the blanks,\nthe gaps in our memory, based on things that we know but don't actually\ncorrespond to what happened. Right? So if I were to tell you\nthat I'm like, you know a story about this\nperson who's like worried that they have cancer, or something like that, and\nthen, you know, they see a doctor and the doctor says, \"Well, things are very much\nlike you would've expected.\" Or like, you know, what you\nwere afraid of or something. When people remember that\nthey'll often remember, well the doctor told the\npatient that he had cancer, even if that wasn't in the story, because they're infusing\nmeaning into that story. Right? So that's a minor distortion. But what happens is, is\nthat sometimes things can really get outta hand\nwhere people have trouble telling the difference between\nthings that they've imagined versus things that happened. But also, as I told you, the act of remembering\ncan change the memory. And so what happens then is\nyou can actually be exposed to some misinformation. And so Elizabeth Loftus was\na real pioneer in this work, and there's lots of other\nwork that's been done since. But basically it's like\nif you remember some event and then I tell you\nsomething about the event later on when you remember\nthe event you might remember some original information from the event as well as some information\nabout what I told you. And sometimes if you're not\nable to tell the difference, that information that\nI told you gets mixed into the story that you had originally. So now I give you some\nmore misinformation, or you're exposed to some more\ninformation somewhere else, and eventually your memory\nbecomes totally detached from what happened. And so sometimes you can\nhave cases where people, this is very rare, but\nyou can do it in lab too, where like a, you know,\nsignificant, not everybody but, you know, a chunk of\npeople will fall for this, where you can give people\nmisinformation about an event that never took place and as\nthey keep trying to remember that event more and more and\nwhat happens is they start to imagine, they start to pull up things from other experiences they've had and eventually they can\nstitch together a vivid memory of something that never happened. Because they're not remembering\nan event that happened, they're remembering the\nact of trying to remember what happened and basically\nputting it together into the wrong story. - So it's fascinating, 'cause\nthis could probably happen at a collective level. Like this is probably what\nsuccessful propaganda machines aim to do, this creating false memory across thousands if not millions of minds. - Yeah, absolutely. I mean this is exactly what they do. And so all these kind of\nfoibles of human memory get magnified when you start\nto have social interactions. So there's a whole literature on something called social contagion, which is basically when\nmisinformation spreads like a virus. Like you remember the\nsame thing that I did, but I give you a little\nbit of wrong information, then that becomes part of\nyour story of what happened. Because once you and I share\na memory, like I tell you about something I've\nexperienced and you tell me about your experience at the same event, it's no longer your memory or\nmy memory, it's our memory. And so now the misinformation spreads. And the more you trust someone, or the more powerful that person is, the more of a voice they have\nin shaping that narrative. Right? And there's all sorts of interesting ways in which misinformation can happen. There's a great example\nof when John McCain and George Bush Jr. were in a primary, and there were these polls where they would do these like... I guess they were like not\nrobocalls, but real calls where they would poll voters but they actually inserted\nsome misinformation about McCain's beliefs\non taxation I think, and maybe it was something\nabout illegitimate children, I don't really remember, but they included\nmisinformation in the question that they asked. Like, you know, \"How do\nyou feel about the fact that he wants to do this?\" Or something. And so people would end\nup becoming convinced he had these, you know, policy things, or these personal things,\nthat were not true, just based on the polls\nthat were being used. So it was a case where,\ninterestingly enough, the people who were using misinformation were actually ahead of the\ncurve relative to the scientists who were trying to study\nthese effects in memory. - Yeah, it's... It's really interesting. So it's not just about truth\nand falsehood as like us as intelligent reasoning machines, but it's the formation of\nmemories where they become like visceral, you can rewrite history. If you just look\nthroughout the 20th century some of the dictatorships\nwith Nazi Germany, with the Soviet Union,\neffective propaganda machines can rewrite our conceptions of history, how we remember our own\nculture, our upbringing, all this kind of stuff. And you could do quite a\nlot of damage in this way. And then there's probably some kind of social contagion happening there. Like certain ideas that may be initiated by the propaganda machine can\nspread faster than others. You could see that in modern day, certain conspiracy theories. There's just something about them that they are like really\neffective at spreading. There's something sexy\nabout them to people, to where something about\nthe human mind eats it up and then uses that to construct memories as if they almost were there to witness whatever the content of\nthe conspiracy theory is. It's fascinating 'cause once\nyou feel like you remember a thing, I feel like there's a certainty, there's a... It emboldens you to like say stuff. Like you really like... It's not just you believe\nan ideas true or not, you're like, it's at\nthe core of your being that you feel like you were\nthere to watch the thing happen. - Yeah, I mean there's so\nmuch in what you're saying. I mean, one of the things\nis, is that people's sense of collective identity is very\nmuch tied to shared memories. If we have a shared narrative of the past, or even better, if we have a shared past we will feel more socially\nconnected with each other, and I will feel part of this group. They're part of my tribe if I remember the same\nthings in the same way. And you brought up this\nweaponization of history and, you know, it really\nspeaks to, I think, one of the parts of memory, which is that if you have a belief you will find, and you\nhave a goal in mind, you will find stuff in\nmemory that aligns with it and you won't see the\nparts in memory that don't. So a lot of the stories we put together are based on our perspectives. Right? And so let's just zoom out for the moment from like misinformation to take something even more fascinating, but not as like, you know, scary. You know, I was reading Thanh Viet Nguyen, but he wrote a book about\nthe collective memory of the Vietnam War. He is a Vietnamese\nimmigrant who was flown out after the war was over. And so he went back to his family to get their stories about the war and they called it the American\nWar, not the Vietnam War. Right? And that just kind of blew my mind, having grown up in the US,\nand having always heard about it as the Vietnam War. But of course they call\nit the American War, 'cause that's what happened. America came in, right? And that's based on their perspective, which is a very valid perspective. And so that just gives you this idea of the way we put\ntogether these narratives based on our perspectives. And I think the opportunities\nthat we can have in memory is if we bring groups together\nfrom different perspectives and we allow them to talk to each other and we allow ourselves to listen. I mean, right now you'll\nhear a lot of just jammering, you know, people going blah,\nblah blah about free speech, but they just wanna listen to themselves. Right? I mean it's like, let's\nface it, the old days before people were supposedly woke they were trying to ban 2\nLive Crew, or, you know. Just think about, Lenny Bruce\ngot canceled for cursing. Jesus Christ.\n- Yeah. - [Charan] You know, it's like- - Yeah.\n- This is nothing new. - Yeah.\n- People don't like to hear things that disagree with them. But if you're in a... I mean you can see two\nsituations in groups with memory. One situation is you have like\npeople who are very dominant, who just take over the\nconversation, and they... Basically what happens\nis the group remembers less from the experience and they remember more of what\nthe dominant narrator says. Right? Now, if you have a\ndiverse group of people, and I don't mean diverse in\nnecessarily the human resources sense of the word, I\nmean diverse in any way you want to take it, right? But diverse in every way, hopefully. And you give everyone a chance to speak, and everyone's being appreciated for their unique contribution, you get more accurate memories and you get more information from it. Right? Even two people who come from\nvery similar backgrounds, if you can appreciate\nthe unique contributions that each one has, you can do a better job of generating information from memory. And that's a way to inoculate\nourselves, I believe, from misinformation in the modern world. But, like everything else, it requires a certain\ntolerance for discomfort. And I think when we don't have much time, and I think when we're stressed out and when we are just tired, it's very hard to tolerate discomfort. - And I mean, social media\nhas a lot of opportunity for this because it\nenables this distributed one-on-one interaction\nthat you're talking about where everybody has a voice, but still our natural inclination... You see this on social media,\nthere's a natural clustering of people and opinions and\nyou just kind of, you know, form these kind of bubbles. I think that's... To me personally, I think\nthat's a technology problem that could be solved. If there's a little bit of interaction, kind, respectful,\ncompassionate interaction with people that have a\nvery different memory, that respectful interaction\nwill start to intermix the memories and ways of thinking to where you're slowly\nmoving towards truth. But that's a technology problem because naturally, left\nto our own devices, we wanna cluster up in a tribe. - Yeah, and that's the human problem. - Yeah.\n- You know. I think a lot of the problems that come up with technology aren't\nthe technology itself as much as the fact that\npeople adapt to the technology in maladaptive ways. I mean, one of my fears about\nAI is not what AI will do, but what people will do. I mean, take text messaging, right? It's like it's a pain in\nthe ass to text people, at least for me. And so what happens is the communication becomes very spartan and\ndevoid of meaning, right? It's just very telegraphic. And that's people adapting\nto the medium, right? I mean look at you, you've\ngot this keyboard, right? That's like got these\nlike dome shaped things, and you've adapted to that\nto communicate, right? That's not the technology adapting to you, that's you adapting to the technology. And I think with, you know,\none of the things I learned when Google started to introduce\nauto complete in emails, I started to use it and\nabout a third of the time I was like, \"This isn't what I wanna say.\" A third of the time I'd be like, \"This is exactly what I wanted to say.\" And a third of the time I was saying, \"Well this is good enough,\nI'll just go with it.\" Right? And so what happens is it's\nnot that the technology necessarily is doing anything so bad as much as it's just going\nto constrain my language because I'm just doing\nwhat's being suggested to me. And so this is why I say, you\nknow, kinda like my mantra for some of what I've learned\nabout everything in memory is to diversify your\ntraining data basically. Because otherwise you're going to be... So like humans have this\ncapability to be so much more creative than anything\ngenerative AI will put together. At least right now, who\nknows where this goes. But it can also go the opposite direction where people could become\nmuch, much less creative if they just become more\nand more like resistant to discomfort, you know,\nand resistant to exposing themselves to novelty, to\ncognitive dissonance and so forth. - I think there is a dance\nbetween natural human adaptation of technology and the people\nthat design the engineering of that technology. So I think there's a lot\nof opportunity to create, like this keyboard,\nthings on net are positive for human behavior. So we adapt, and all this kind of stuff, but when you look at the long\narc of history across years and decades, has humanity\nbeen flourishing? Are humans creating more awesome stuff? Are humans happier? All that kind of stuff. And so there, I think\ntechnology on net has been, and I think, maybe hope,\nwill always be on net a positive thing. - Do you think people are happier now than they were 50 years\nago, or 100 years ago? - Yes. Yes. - I don't know about that. - I think humans in\ngeneral like to reminisce about the past, like\nthat times were better. - [Charan] That's true. - And complain about the weather today, or complain about whatever today, 'cause we, there's this\nkind of complainy engine that's just, there's so\nmuch pleasure in saying, you know, \"Life sucks.\" For some reason. - That's why I love punk rock. - Exactly. I mean there's something in\nhumans that loves complaining, even about trivial things. But complaining about change,\ncomplaining about everything. But ultimately I think,\non net, on every measure, things are getting better,\nlife is getting better. - Oh, life is getting better, but I don't know that necessarily that tracks people's happiness, right? I mean, I would argue\nthat maybe, who knows, I don't know this, but\nI wouldn't be surprised if people in hunter gatherer\nsocieties are happier. I mean, I wouldn't be\nsurprised if they're happier than people who have\naccess to modern medicine, and email, and cell phones. - Well I don't think there's\na question whether you take hunter gatherer folks and\nput them into modern day and give 'em enough time to adapt, they would be much happier. The question is, in terms\nof every single problem they've had is now solved. There's now food, there's\nguarantee of survival, and shelter, and all this kind of stuff. - Oh.\n- So what you're asking is a deeper sort of biological question. Do we want to be a Werner Herzog, that movie, \"Happy People:\nLife in the Taiga?\" Do we want to be busy 100% of\nour time hunting, gathering, surviving, worried about the next day? Maybe that constant\nstruggle ultimately creates a more fulfilling life. I don't know. But I do know this\nmodern society allows us to, when we're sick, to find\nmedicine, to find cures, when we're hungry, to get food, much more than we did even 100 years ago. And there's many more activities\nthat you could perform, all creative, all these kinds of stuff, that enables the flourishing of humans at the individual level. Whether that leads to happiness, I mean, that's a very deep\nphilosophical question. Maybe struggle, deep struggle,\nis necessary for happiness. - Or maybe cultural connection. You know, maybe it's about like\nfunctioning in social groups that are meaningful, and like having time. But I do think this is,\nthere's an interesting memory related thing,\nwhich is that if you look at like things like reinforcement learning for instance, you're not\nlearning necessarily every time you get a reward, if it's the same reward, you're not learning that much. You mainly learn if it\ndeviates from your expectation of what you're supposed to get, right? So it's like you get a\npaycheck every, you know, month from MIT, or whatever, right? And it's like you're kind\nof, you probably don't even kind of get excited about it\nwhen you get the paycheck. But if they cut your salary,\nyou're gonna be pissed. And if they increase your salary, you go, \"Oh, good, I got a bonus.\" You know? And that adaptation and that ability that basically you learn\nto expect these things, I think, is a major source\nof, I guess it's a major way in which we're kind of more,\nin my opinion, wired to strive and not be happy to be\nin a state of wanting. And, you know, so people\ntalk about dopamine for instance, being\nthis pleasure chemical. And it's like there's a\nlot of compelling research to suggest it's not about pleasure at all, it's about the discomfort\nthat energizes you to get things, to seek a reward, right? And so you could give an\nanimal that's been deprived of dopamine a reward and,\n\"Oh, yeah, I enjoy it. It's pretty good.\" But they're not gonna\ndo anything to get it. You know? And just one of the weird\nthings in our research is, is we, I got into\ncuriosity from a postdoc in my lab, Matthias Gruber,\nand one of the things that we found is when we\ngave people a question, like a trivia question, that\nthey wanted the answer to. That question, the more curious people were about the answer, the more activity in these dopamine related\ncircuits in the brain we would see. And, again, that was not\ndriven by the answer per se, but by the question. So it was not about\ngetting the information, it was about the drive\nto seek the information. But it depends on how you take that. If you get this uncomfortable\ngap between what you know and what you want to\nknow, you could either use that to motivate you and energize you, or you could use it to say, \"I\ndon't wanna hear about this, this disagrees with my beliefs, I'm gonna go back to my echo chamber.\" You know? - Mm-hmm, yeah. I like what you said\nthat maybe we're designed to be in a kind of\nconstant state of wanting, which by the way is a\npretty good either band name or rock song name, state of wanting. - That's like a hardcore band name. - Hardcore band.\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Lex] Yeah, it's pretty good. - But I also like the hedonic treadmill. - Hedonic treadmill's pretty good. - Yeah, yeah, we could use that\nfor like our techno project, I think. - You mean the one we're starting? - Yeah, exactly.\n- Okay, great. We're going on tour soon. (Charan laughing) This is our announcement. - We could build a false\nmemory of a show in fact, if we want. Let's just put it all together so... We don't even have to do all\nthe work to play the show, we can just create a memory of it. It might as well happen, 'cause the remembering\nitself is in charge anyway."

I remember reading \"1984,\" where, sorry for the dark turn\nof our conversation, but through torture\nyou can make people say anything and essentially\nremember anything. I wonder to which degree\nthere's like truth to that. If you look at the torture that\nhappened in the Soviet Union for confessions, all that kind of stuff. How much can you really\nget people to really, you know, to force\nfalse memories, I guess? - Yeah, I mean I think\nthere's a lot of history of this actually in the\ncriminal justice system. You might have heard the\nterm the third degree. If you actually look it up, historically, it was a very\nintense set of beatings and, you know, starvation\nand physical demands that they would place on\npeople to get them to talk. And, you know, there was\ncertainly a lot of work that's been done by the CIA in terms of enhanced interrogation techniques. And, from what I understand,\nthe research actually shows that they just produce\nwhat people want to hear, not necessarily the information\nthat is being looked for. And the reason is, is that... I mean, there's different reasons. I mean, one is people just get tired of being tortured and just say whatever. But another part of it\nis, is that you create a very interesting set of conditions where there's an authority\nfigure telling you something that, \"You did\nthis, we know you did this, we have witnesses saying you did this.\" So now you start to question yourself. Then they put you under stress. Maybe they're not feeding you, maybe they're kinda\nlike making you be cold or, you know, exposing you to like music that you can't stand, or something. Whatever it is, right? It's like they're creating\nthis physical stress. And so stress starts to\nact on, you know, starts to downregulate the prefrontal cortex. You're not necessarily\nas good at monitoring the accuracy of stuff. Then they start to get\nnice to you and they say, \"Imagine...\" You know, \"Okay, I know\nyou don't remember this, but maybe we can walk you through how it could have happened.\" And they feed you the information. And so you're in this\nweakened mental state and you're being encouraged\nto imagine things by people who give you\na plausible scenario. And at some point certain\npeople can be very coaxed into creating a memory for\nsomething that never happened. And there's actually some\npretty convincing cases out there where you don't\nknow exactly the truth. There's a sheriff, for\ninstance, who came to believe that he had a false memory. I mean that he had a memory\nof doing sexual abuse based on, you know,\nessentially I think it was... You know, I'm not gonna tell the story because I don't remember it well enough to necessarily accurately give it to you, but people could look this stuff up. There are definitely\nstories out there like this where people confess to crimes\nthat they just didn't do, and objective evidence came out later on. But there's a basic recipe for it, which is you feed people the information that you want them to\nremember, you stress them out, you have an authority figure kind of like pushing\nthis information on them, or you motivate them to\nproduce the information you're looking for. And that pretty much over\ntime gives you what you want. - It's really tragic\nthat centralized power can use these kinds of\ntools to destroy lives. Sad."

      "section": "Heartbreak",
      "text": "Since there's a theme about music throughout this conversation, one of the best topics\nfor songs is heartbreak, love in general, but heartbreak. Why and how do we remember\nand forget heartbreak? Asking for a friend. - Oh, God, that's so hard to... Asking for a friend, I love that. Oh, it's such a hard one. Well, so I mean part of\nthis is we tend to go back to particular times that are the more\nemotionally intense periods. And so that's a part of it. And, again, memory's designed to kind of capture these things that are biologically significant, and attachment is a, you know, big part of biological significance for humans. Right? Human relationships are super important. And sometimes that heartbreak\ncomes with massive changes in your beliefs about somebody, say if they cheated on you,\nor something like that, or regrets, and you kind\nof ruminate about things that you've done wrong. There's really so many reasons though. But, you know, I mean, I've had this. My first pet I had as, you know, was, we got it for a\nwedding present, was a cat and got it after like... But it died of FIP when\nit was four years old. And, you know, I just\nwould see her everywhere around the house, you know. We got another cat, then we got a dog, dog eventually died of cancer and the cat just died recently. And, you know, so we got a new dog because I kept seeing the dog around and I was just so heartbroken\nabout this, and... But I still remember the pets that died. It just comes back to you. I mean, it's part of this... I think there's also\nsomething about attachment that's just so crucial that drives, again, these things that we want to remember and that gives us that longing sometimes. Sometimes it's also not\njust about the heartbreak, but about the positive\naspects of it, right? 'Cause the loss comes\nfrom not only the fact that the relationship is over, but you had all of these good things before that you can now\nsee in a new light, right? And so part of, one of the things that I found from my clinical background that really I think gave\nme a different perspective on memory is so much\nof the therapy process was guided towards reframing\nand getting people to look at the past in a different way. Not by imposing, changing\npeople's memories, or not by imposing an interpretation, but just offering a different perspective and maybe one that's kind of\nmore optimized towards learning and, you know, and appreciation maybe, or gratitude, whatever it is, right? That gives you a way of taking... I think you said it in\nthe beginning, right? Where you can have this kind\nof like dark experiences and you can use it as training data to, you know, grow in new ways. But it's hard. - This... I often go back to this\nmoment, this show \"Louis,\" with Louis C.K., where he's\nall heartbroken about a breakup with a woman he loves and\nan older gentleman tells him that that's actually the\nbest part, that heartbreak, because you get to intensely experience how valuable this love was. He says the worst part is forgetting it. It's actually when you\nget over the heartbreak, that's the worst part. So I sometimes think about\nthat because, you know, having the love and losing it, like the losing it is\nwhen you sometimes feel it the deepest, which is a\ninteresting way to celebrate the past and relive it. It sucks that you don't have a thing, but when you don't have a\nthing it's a good moment to viscerally experience the memories of something that you\nnow appreciate even more. - So you don't believe that\nan owner of a lonely heart is much better than an\nowner of a broken heart? You think an owner of a broken heart is better than the\nowner of a lonely heart? - Yes, for sure. I think so. I think so. But I'm gonna have to, day by day... I don't know, I'm gonna have to listen to some more Bruce Springsteen\nto figure that one out. (Charan laughing) - Well, you know, it's funny because it's like after I turned 50 I think of death all the time. Like I just think that, you\nknow, I'm in, like, I probably, I have fewer, probably\nhave fewer years ahead of me than I have behind me, right? So I think about, I think about one thing, which is what are the memories\nthat I wanna carry with me for the next period of time? And also about like, just\nthe fact that everything around me could be, you\nknow, I know more people who are, you know, dying\nfor various reasons. And so... I mean, not lots, I'm not that old, right? It's like... But, you know, it's\nsomething I think about a lot and I'm reminded of like how I talk to somebody who's like,\nyou know, who's a Buddhist, and I was like, you know,\nthe whole idea of Buddhism is renouncing attachment. In some way the idea of\nBuddhism is like staying out of the world of memory and\nstaying in the moment, right? And they talked about, you\nknow, it's like how do you, how do you renounce\nattachments to the people that you love, right? And they're just saying, \"Well, I appreciate that I\nhave this moment with them and knowing that they will\ndie makes me appreciate this moment that much more.\" I mean, you said something similar, right? In your daily routine that you\nthink about things this way. Right? - Yeah, I meditate on mortality every day. But, I don't know, I... At the same time, that\nreally makes you appreciate the moment and live in the moment, and I also appreciate the\nfull, deep rollercoaster of suffering involved in life. The little and the big too. So I don't know. The Buddhist kinda removing\nyourself from the world, or the stoic removing\nyourself from the world, the world of emotion,\nI'm torn about that one. I'm not sure. - Well, you know, this is\nwhere Hinduism and Buddhism, or at least some strains of\nHinduism and Buddhism, differ. In Hinduism, like if you\nread the Bhagavad Gita, the philosophy is not one\nof renouncing the world, because the idea is, is\nthat not doing something is no different than\ndoing something, right? So what they argue... And, again, you could\ninterpret it in different ways, positive and negative, but the argument is, is that you don't\nwant to renounce action, but you want to renounce\nthe fruits of the action. You don't do it because of the outcome, you do it because of the process, because the process is part\nof the balance of the world that you're trying to preserve, right? And of course you could\ntake that different ways, but I really think about\nthat from time to time in terms of like, you know,\nletting go of this idea of does this book sell, or\ntrying to, you know, like impress you and get you to laugh\nat my jokes or whatever, and just be more like I'm\nsharing this information with you and, you know,\ngetting to know you, or whatever it is. But it's hard, right? It's like, 'cause we're so\ndriven by the reinforcer, the outcome. - You're just part of the\nprocess of telling the joke, and if I laugh or not, that's\nup to the universe to decide. - Yep, it's my dharma."

      "section": "Nature of time",
      "text": "- How does studying memory\naffect your understanding of the nature of time? So like we've been talking\nabout us living in the present and making decisions about the future, standing on the foundation\nof these memories and narratives about the\nmemories that we've constructed. So it feels like it does\nweird things to time. - Yeah, and the reason\nis, is that in some sense, I think, especially\nthe farther we go back, I mean there's all sorts of\ninteresting things that happen. So your sense of like if\nI ask you how different does one hour ago feel from two hours ago? You'd probably say pretty different. But if I ask you, okay,\ngo back one year ago versus one year and one hour ago, it's the same difference in time. It won't feel very different, right? So there's this kind of\ncompression that happens as you look back farther in time. So that it is kinda like\nwhy when you're older the difference between\nsomebody who's like 50 and, you know, 45 doesn't\nseem as big as the difference between like 10 and five\nor something, right? When you're 10 years old, everything seems like it's a long period of time. Here's the point is that, you know, so one of the interesting things that\nI found when I was working on the book actually,\nwas during the pandemic, I just decided to ask people in my class, when we were doing the remote instruction. So one of the things I did\nwas I would poll people. And so I just asked people, \"Do you feel like the\ndays are moving by slower or faster, or about the same?\" Almost everyone in the class said that the days were moving by slower. So then I would say, \"Okay, so do you feel like the weeks are passing by\nslower, faster or the same?\" And the majority of them said that the weeks were passing by faster. So, according to the laws of physics, I don't think that makes any sense, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - But according to memory it did, because what happened was\npeople were doing the same thing over and over in the same context. And without that change\nin context their feeling was that they were in one\nlong monotonous event. And so... But then at the end of\nthe week you look back at that week and you say,\n\"Well what happened?\" I have no memories of what happened. So that week just went by\nwithout even my noticing it. But that week went by during\nthe same amount of time as an eventful week where\nyou might've been going out, hanging out with friends, on\nvacation, or whatever, right? It's just that nothing happened because you're doing the\nsame thing over and over. So I feel like memory really\nshapes our sense of time, but it does so in part because context is so\nimportant for memory. - Well that compression you mentioned, it's an interesting process. 'Cause when I think about\nwhen I was like 12 or 15, I just fundamentally feel\nlike the same person. It's interesting what\nthat compression does. It makes me feel like it's\nall, we're all connected, not just amongst humans and spatially, but in terms, back in time, there's a kinda eternal nature, like the timelessness, I guess, to life. That could be also a\ngenetic thing just for me, I don't know if everyone\nagrees to this view of time. But to me it all feels the same. - Like you don't feel the\npassage of time, or... - No, I feel the passage\nof time the same way that your students did from day to day. There's certain markers that let you know that time has passed, you\ncelebrate birthdays, and so on. But the core of who I am\nand who others I know are, or events it like that\ncompression of my understanding of the world removes time. 'Cause time is not useful\nfor the compression. So like the details of\nthat time, at least for me, is not useful to understanding\nthe core of the thing. So... - Maybe what it is is is\nthat you really like to see connections between things. This is like really what motivates me in science actually too. But it's like when you\nstart recalling the past to, you know, and seeing the\nconnections between the past and present, now you have this kind of web of interconnected memories, right? And so I can imagine in that sense there is this kind of, the\npresent is with you, right? But what's interesting\nabout what you said too that struck me is that\nyour 16-year-old self was probably very complex, you know. And I, by the way, I'm the same way, but it's like it really is the source of a lot of darkness for me. So... But when like you can look\nback at like, let's say you hear a song that you used to play like before you would\ngo do a sports thing, or something like that. And you might not think\nof yourself as an athlete, but once you get back to that mental, you mentally time travel\nto that particular thing, you open up this little\ncompartment of yourself that wasn't there before, right? That didn't seem accessible before. Dan Schacter's lab did\nthis really cool study where they would ask people to either remember doing\nsomething altruistic or imagine doing something altruistic and that act made them more likely to want to do things for other people. So that act of mental\ntime travel can change who you are in the present. And we tend to think of... This goes back to that\nillusion of stability. And we tend to think of memory\nin this very deterministic way, that I am who I am\nbecause I have this past. But we have a very multifaceted\npast and can access different parts of it\nand change in the moment based on whatever part we wanna reach for. Right? - How does nostalgia connect\ninto this, like this desire and pleasure associated with going back? - Yeah, so my friend Felipe\nDe Brigard wrote this, and it just like blew my\nmind, where the word nostalgia was coined by a Swiss physician who was actually studying\ntraumatized soldiers, and so he described\nnostalgia as a disease. And the idea was it was bringing\nthese people extraordinary unhappiness because they're remembering how things used to be. And I think it's very complex. So as people get older, for instance, nostalgia can be an enormous\nsource of happiness, right? And being nostalgic can improve people's moods in the moment. But it just depends on\nwhat they do with it. Because what you can\nsometimes see is nostalgia has the opposite effect of thinking, \"Those were the good old days\nand those days are over.\" Right? It's like America used to be\nso great and now it sucks. Or, you know, my life used to\nbe so great when I was a kid and now it's not. Right? And you're selectively\nremembering the things that... I mean, we don't realize how selective our remembering self is. And so, you know, I lived\nthrough the seventies, it sucked, you know, it was like... Partly it sucked more for me, but I would say that even otherwise it's like there's all\nsorts of problems going on. Gas lines, people were like, you know, worried about like Russia,\nnuclear war, blah, blah blah. So I mean it's just this idea that people have about the\npast can be very useful if it brings you happiness in the present, but if it narrows your\nworldview in the present, you're not aware of those\nbiases that you have, you will end up, you can end\nup, it can be toxic, right? Either at a personal level\nor at a collective level."

      "section": "Brain–computer interface (BCI)",
      "text": "- Let me ask you both a practical question and an out there question. So let's start with\nthe more practical one. What are your thoughts about BCIs, brain-computer interfaces, and the work that's\ngoing on with Neuralink? We talked about electrodes and different ways of measuring the brain and here Neuralink is working on basically two-way\ncommunication with the brain. And the more out there\nquestion will be like, where does this go? But more practically in the near term, what do you think about Neuralink? - Yeah, I mean I can't say\nspecifics about the company 'cause I haven't studied it that much. But I mean, I think\nthere's two parts of it. So one is they're developing\nsome really interesting technology, I think with\nthese like surgical robots, and things like that. BCI though has like a whole\nlot of innovation going on and I'm not necessarily\nseeing any scientific evidence from Neuralink, and maybe that's just 'cause I'm not looking\nfor it, but I'm not seeing the evidence that they're anywhere near where the scientific community is. And there's lots of startups that are doing incredibly\ninnovative stuff. One of my colleagues Sergey\nStavisky is just like a genius in this area and they're working on it. I think speech prosthetics\nlike that are incorporating, you know, decoding techniques with AI and, you know, movement perspectives. It's just like the rate of\nprogress is just enormous. So part of the technology\nis having good enough data and understanding which data to use and what to do with it, right? And then the other part of\nit then is the algorithms for decoding it and so forth. And I think part of\nthat has really resulted in some real breakthroughs\nin neuroscience as a result. So there's lots of new\ntechnologies like neuropixels, for instance, that allow\nyou to harvest activity from many, many neurons\nfrom a single electrode. I know Neuralink has some technologies that are also along these\nlines, but I haven't... Again, because they do their own stuff, the scientific community doesn't see it. Right? But I think BCI is much,\nmuch bigger than Neuralink and there's just so much\ninnovation happening. I think the interesting\nquestion which we may be getting into is, I was talking\nto Sergey a while ago about, you know, so a lot of language, it's not just what we\nhear and what we speak, but also our intentions\nand our internal models and, you know, so are\nyou really gonna be able to restore language without\ndealing with that part of it? And he brought up a really\ninteresting question, which is the ethics of reading\nout people's intentions and understanding of the\nworld as opposed to the more, you know, the more\nconcrete parts of hearing and producing movements. Right? - Just so we're clear, 'cause you said a few interesting things. When we talk about language and BCIs, what we mean is getting\nsignal from the brain and generating the language. Say you're not able to actually speak, it's as a kind of linguistic prosthetic, or it's able to speak for you exactly what you wanted to say. And then the deeper question\nis, well, saying something isn't just the letters, the\nwords that you're saying, it's also the intention behind it, the feeling behind,\nall that kind of stuff, and is it ethical to\nreveal that full shebang, the full context of what's\ngoing on in our brain. That's really... That's really interesting. That's really interesting. I mean, our thoughts, is it ethical for anyone to\nhave access to our thoughts? Because right now the re\nthe resolution is so low that we're okay with it, even doing studies and\nall this kind of stuff. But if neuroscience\nhas a few breakthroughs to where you can start\nto map out the QR codes for different thoughts, for\ndifferent kinds of thoughts, maybe political thoughts,\nyou know, McCarthyism, what if I'm getting a lot\nof them communist thoughts? Or however we want to\ncategorize or label it. That's interesting. That's really interesting. I think ultimately this\nalways the more transparency there is about the human\nmind, the better it is. But there could be always\nintermediate battles with how much control\ndoes a centralized entity have, like a government and so on. What is the regulation,\nwhat are the rules? What are the... What's legal and illegal? You know, if you talk about the police whose job is to track\ndown criminals, and so on, and you look at all the history, how the police could abuse its power to control the citizenry,\nall that kind of stuff. So people are always\nparanoid, and rightfully so. It's fascinating. It's really fascinating. You know, we talk about freedom of speech, you know, freedom of thought, which is also a very important liberty at the core of this country,\nand probably humanity, starts to get awfully tricky\nwhen you start to be able to collect those thoughts. But what I wanted to actually\nask you is do you think, for fun and for practical\npurposes, you'll be able to, we would be able to modify memories? So how difficult is it to... How far away we are from\nunderstanding the different parts of the brain, everything\nwe've been talking about, in order to figure out how\ncan we adjust this memory at the crude level from\nunpleasant to pleasant? You talked about we can remember the mall and the people, like\nlocation of the people. Can we keep the people\nand change the place? Like this kind of stuff. How difficult is that? - Well, I mean in some sense we know we can do it just behaviorally, right? - [Lex] Behaviorally, yes. - I can just like tell you, give, you know, under\ncertain conditions anyway, I can give you the misinformation and then you can change the people and the places and so forth, right? On the crude level, there's a lot of work that's being done on a phenomenon\ncalled reconsolidation, which is the idea that essentially\nwhen I recall a memory, what happens is, is that the\nconnections between the neurons and that cell assembly\nthat give you the memory are going to be like more modifiable. And so some people have used techniques to try to like, for instance,\nwith fear memories to reduce that physical visceral\ncomponent of the memory when it's being activated. Right now I think I've, as an\noutsider looking at the data, I think it's like mixed results. And part of it is, and this\nspeaks to the more complex issue, is that you\ndon't, you need somebody to actually fully recall\nthat traumatic memory in the first place, in\norder to actually modify it. And then what is the memory? That is the key part of the problem. So if we go back to\nreading people's thoughts, what is the thought? I mean people can sometimes\nlook at this like behaviorists and go, \"Well the memory\nis like I've given you A and you produce B.\" But I think that's a very\nbankrupt concept about memory. I think it's much more\ncomplicated than that. And, you know, one of the\nthings that when we started studying naturalistic memory,\nlike memory from movies, that was so hard was we had to change the way we did the studies. Because if I show you a movie and I show and I watch the same movie and you recall everything that happened and I recall everything that happened, we might take a different\namount of time to do it, we might use different words, and yet to an outside observer we might have recalled the same thing. Right? So it's not about the words necessarily and it's not about how\nlong we spent, or whatever. There's something deeper that\nis there that's this idea. But it's like, how do you\nunderstand that thought? I encounter a lot of concrete thinking that it's like if I show\na model, like, you know, the visual information that a\nperson sees when they drive, I can basically reverse engineer driving. Well that's not really how it works. I once saw a talk by somebody, or I saw somebody talking\nin this discussion between neuroscientists and AI people and he was saying that the\nproblem with self-driving cars that they had in cities\nas opposed to highways was that the car was okay at,\nyou know, doing the things that it's supposed to, but\nwhen there were pedestrians around it couldn't predict\nthe intentions of people. And so that unpredictability\nof people was the problem that they were having in, you know, the self-driving car design. 'Cause it didn't have a\ngood enough internal model of what the people were, you know, what they were doing, what they wanted. And what do you think about that? - Well, I spent a huge amount\nof time watching pedestrians, thinking about pedestrians,\nthinking about what it takes to solve the problem of measuring, detecting the intention of a pedestrian, really, of a human being\nin this particular context of having to cross the street. And it's fascinating. I think... I think it's a window into\nhow complex social systems are that involve humans because, you know, I\nwould just stand there and watch intersections for hours. And what you start to\nfigure out is every single intersection has its own personality. So like there's a history\nto that intersection, like jaywalking. Certain intersections allow\njaywalking a lot more, because what happens is\nwe're leaders and followers. So there's a regular, let's\nsay, and they get off the subway and they start crossing on a red light, and they do this every single day. And then there's people that don't show up to that intersection often, and they're looking for cues of how we're supposed to behave here. And if a few people start to jaywalk and cross on a red light, they will also. They will follow. And there's just a dynamic\nto that intersection. There's a spirit to it. And if you look at Boston versus New York versus a rural town versus... Even Boston, San Francisco,\nor here in Austin, there's just different\npersonalities citywide, but there's different\npersonalities area wide, region wide, and there's\ndifferent personalities, different intersections. And it's just fascinating. For a car to be able to\ndetermine that is tricky. Now what machine learning\nsystems are able to do well is collect a huge amount of data. So for us it's tricky because we get to like\nunderstand the world with very limited information. - [Charan] That's right. - And make decisions grounded\nin this big foundation model that we've built of\nunderstanding how humans work. AI could literally, in\nthe context of driving, this is where I've often been really torn in both directions. If you just collect a huge amount of data, all of that information, and then compress it into a representation of\nhow humans cross streets, it's probably all there. In the same way that you\nhave a Noam Chomsky who says, \"No, no, no, AI can't talk, can't write convincing language without understanding language.\" And, you know, more and more\nyou see large language models without quote unquote\nunderstanding can generate very convincing language. But I think what the\nprocess of compression, from a huge amount of data\ncompressing into a representation is doing is in fact understanding deeply. In order to be able to\ngenerate one letter at a time, one word at a time, you have to understand the cruelty of Nazi Germany and the beauty of sending humans to space. And like you have to understand all of that in order to generate, like, \"I'm going to the\nkitchen to get an apple,\" and do that grammatically correctly. You have to have a world model that includes all of human behavior. - You think an LLM is\nbuilding that world model? - It has to, in order\nto be good at generating one word at a time in\na convincing sentence. And in the same way I\nthink AI that drives a car, if it has enough data, we'll\nbe able to form a world model that we'll be able to predict correctly what the pedestrian does. But when we as humans\nare watching pedestrians we slowly realize, \"Damn,\nthis is really complicated.\" In fact, when you start to\nself-reflect on driving, you realize driving is really complicated. There's like subtle cues\nwe take about like... Just, there's a million\nthings I could say, but like one of them,\ndetermining who around you is an asshole, aggressive driver. - Yes. Yes.\n- Potentially dangerous. - I was just thinking about this. Yes.\n- Or like- - You can read it a mile... Once you become a great driver\nyou can see it a mile away, this guy's gonna pull an\nasshole move in front of you. - [Lex] Yeah, exactly. - He's like way back there but\nyou know it's gonna happen. - And then I don't know what... 'Cause we're ignoring all the other cars. - Yeah.\n- But for some reason the asshole, like a red, like\na glowing, obvious symbol is just like right there\neven in the periphery vision. 'Cause we're, again, we're,\nusually when we're driving just looking forward, but we're like using the periphery vision to figure stuff out and it's like a little puzzle that we're usually only\nallocating a small amount of our attention to, at least\nlike cognitive attention to. And it's fascinating. But I think AI just has a\nfundamentally different suite of sensors, in terms of\nthe bandwidth of data that's coming in, that allows\nyou to form the representation and perform inference\non the representation using the representation you form that for the case of driving, I think it could be quite effective."

      "text": "But one of the things\nthat's currently missing, even though OpenAI just recently\nannounced adding memory. And I did wanna ask you\nlike how important it is, how difficult is it to add\nsome of the memory mechanisms that you've seen in humans to AI systems? - I would say superficially not that hard, but then in a deeper\nlevel, very, very hard. Because we don't understand\nepisodic memory, right? So one of the ideas I\ntalk about in the book is one of the oldest kind of dilemmas in computational neurosciences,\nwhat Steve Grossberg called the stability plasticity dilemma, right? When do you say something is new and overwrite your preexisting knowledge versus going with what you had before and making incremental changes? And so, you know, part of the problem with going through like\nmassive, you know what I mean? Part of the problem of\nthings like if you're trying to design an LLM, or something like that, is, especially for English,\nthere's so many exceptions to the rules, right? And so if you wanna rapidly\nlearn the exceptions, you're gonna lose the rules. And if you wanna keep the rules, you have a harder time\nlearning the exception. And so David Marr is one\nof the early pioneers in computational neuroscience, and then Jay McClelland and my colleague Randy O'Reilly, some other people like Neil\nCohen, all these people started to come up with the idea that maybe that's part of what we need in what the human brain is doing is we have this kind of a,\nactually a fairly dumb system, which just says this happened\nonce at this point in time, which we call episodic\nmemory, so to speak, and then we have this knowledge that we've accumulated\nfrom our experiences as semantic memory. So now when we want to... We encounter a situation that's surprising and violates all our\nprevious expectations, what happens is, is that now\nwe can form an episodic memory here and the next time we're\nin a similar situation, boom, we can supplement our knowledge with this information\nfrom our episodic memory and reason about what the\nright thing to do is, right? So it gives us this enormous\namount of flexibility to stop on a dime and change\nwithout having to erase everything we've already learned. And that solution is incredibly powerful because it gives you\nof the ability to learn from so much less\ninformation, really, right? And it gives you that flexibility. So one of the things I think\nthat makes humans great is having both episodic\nand semantic memory. Now can you build something like that? You know, computational\nneuroscience people would say, \"Well, yeah, you just record a moment and you just get it and you're done.\" Right? But when do you record that moment? How much do you record? What's the information you prioritize and what's the information you don't? These are the hard questions. When do you use episodic memory? When do you just throw it away? And these are the hard\nquestions we're still trying to figure out in people. And then you start to think\nabout all these mechanisms that we have in the brain for figuring out some of these things. And it's not just one,\nbut it's many of them that are interacting with each other. And then you just take\nnot only the episodic and the semantic, but then you start to take the motivational,\nsurvival things, right? It's just like the fight\nor flight responses that we associate with particular things, or the kind of like reward motivation that we associate with\ncertain things, so forth. And those things are absent from AI. I frankly don't know if we want it. I don't necessarily want a\nself-motivated LLM, right? It's like... And then there's the problem\nof how do you even like build the motivations that should\nguide a proper reinforcement learning kind of thing, for instance? So a friend of mine, Sam\nGershman, I might be missing the quote exactly, but he basically said, \"You know, if I wanted to\ntrain like a typical AI model to make me as much money as possible, first thing I might do is sell my house.\" So it's not even just\nabout having one goal, or one objective, but just\nhaving all these competing goals and objectives, right? And then things start to\nget really complicated. - Well it's all interconnected. I mean, just even the thing\nyou've mentioned is the moment, you know, if we record\na moment like the... It's difficult to express\nconcretely what a moment is, like how deeply connected\nit is to the entirety of it. Maybe to record a moment you have to make a universe from scratch. Like you have to have, you\nhave to include everything, you have to include all\nthe emotions involved, all the context, all the\nthings that built around it, all the social connections,\nall the visual experiences, all the sensory experience, all of that, all the\nhistory that came before that moment is built on. And we somehow, we take all\nof that and we compress it and keep the useful parts and then integrate it\ninto the whole thing, into our whole narrative. And then each individual\nhas their own little version of that narrative and then we collide. In a social way.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] And then we\nadjust it, and we evolve. - Yeah, yeah. I mean, well even if we\nwanna go super simple, right? Like Tyler Bonnen, who's a\npostdoc who's collaborating with me, he actually studied a lot of computer vision at Stanford. And so one of the things he was\ninterested in is some people who have brain damage\nin areas of the brain that were thought to be\nimportant for memory, but they also seemed to have\nsome perception problems with particular kinds\nof object perception. And this is super controversial and some people found\nthis effect, some didn't. And he went back to computer vision and he said, \"Let's take\nthe best state of the art computer vision models and let's give them the same kinds of perception tests that we were giving to these people.\" And then he would find the images where the computer vision\nmodels would just struggle. And you would find that\nthey just didn't do well. Even if you add more\nparameters, you add more layers on and on and on, it doesn't help, right? The architecture didn't matter, it was just there, the problem. And then he found those\nwere the exact ones where these humans with particular damage to this area called the perineal cortex, that was where they were struggling. So somehow this brain area\nwas being, was important for being able to do these\nthings that were adversarial to these computer vision models. So then he found that it only happened if people had enough time they could make those discriminations,\nbut without enough time, if they just get a glance, they're just like the\ncomputer vision models. So then what he started to say was, \"Well maybe let's look at people's eyes.\" Right? So a computer vision\nmodel sees every pixel all at once, right? It's not, you know... And we don't, we never see\nevery pixel all at once. Even if I'm looking at\na screen with pixels, I'm not seeing every pixel at once. I'm grabbing little points on\nthe screen by moving my eyes around and getting a very\nhigh resolution picture of what I'm focusing on and kind of a lower resolution information about everything else. But I'm not necessarily choosing, but I'm directing that exploration. And allowing people to move their eyes and integrate that information\ngave them something that the computer vision\nmodels weren't able to do. So somehow integrating\ninformation across time and getting less information at each step gave you more out of the process. - I mean the process of\nallocating attention across time seems to be a really important process. Even the breakthroughs that you get with machine learning mostly\nhas to do with attention, is all you need is bot attention. Transformative bot attention. So attention is a really interesting one. - Yeah.\n- But then like, yeah, how you allocate\nthat attention, again, is like, is at the core\nof like what it means to be intelligent, what it\nmeans to process the world, integrate all the important things, discard all the unimportant things. Attention is at the core of\nit, it's probably at the core of memory too, because there's\nso much sensory information, there's so much going on,\nthere's so much going on, to filter it down to almost nothing and just keep those parts. And to keep those parts and\nthen whenever there's an error to adjust the model such that\nyou can allocate attention even better to new\nthings that would result, maybe maximize the chance\nof confirming the model or disconfirming the model that you have and adjusting it since then. Yeah, attention is a weird one. I was... I was always fascinated. I mean, I got a chance to\nstudy peripheral vision for a bit and indirectly\nstudied attention through that. And it's just fascinating\nhow humans, how good humans are at looking around and\ngathering information. - Yeah, at the same time people\nare terrible at detecting changes that can happen. - Yes.\n- In the environment. - Yes.\n- If they're not attending in the right way, if their predictive model\nis too strong, you know. So you have these weird things where like the machines can\ndo better than the people. It's not that it's like... You know, so this is\nthe thing is people go, \"Oh, the machines can do this stuff that's just like humans.\" It's like, well the machines\nmake different kinds of mistakes than the people do. And I will never be convinced, unless I... That, you know, we've replicated human... I don't even like the term intelligence 'cause I think it's a stupid concept, but it's like I don't think\nwe've replicated human intelligence unless I\nknow that the simulator is making exactly the same kinds\nof mistakes that people do. Because people make\ncharacteristic mistakes, they have characteristic biases, they have characteristic\nlike, you know, heuristics that we use and those I\nhave yet to see evidence that ChatGPT will do that."

      "section": "ADHD",
      "text": "- Since we're talking about attention, is there an interesting connection to you between ADHD and memory? - Well it's interesting for\nme because when I was a child I was actually told... My school, I don't know if it came from a school psychologist, they\ndid do some testing on me, I know, for like IQ and stuff like that. Or if it just came from\nteachers who hated me. But they told my parents that I had ADHD. And so this was of\ncourse in the seventies. So basically they said like,\n\"You know, he has poor motor control and he's got ADHD.\" And so... And, you know, there were social issues. So like I could have been\nput a year ahead in school but then they said, \"Oh, but he doesn't have\nthe social intelligence. He doesn't have the social capabilities.\" - [Lex] Right. - So I still ended up being\nlike, you know, an outcast even in my own grade. But then like... So then my parents said, okay,\nwell they got me on a diet free of artificial colors and flavors, because that was the thing that people talked about back then. So I'm interested this topic because I've come to appreciate now that I have many of the characteristics, if not, you know, full blown. It's like I'm definitely\ntime blindness, rejection... I mean, you name it they talk about it. It's like impulsive behavior. I can tell you about all sorts\nof fights I've gotten into in the past. Just you name it. But yeah, so ADHD is fascinating though because right now we're seeing like more and more diagnosis of it and I don't know what to say about that. I don't know how much of that is based on kind of inappropriate expectations, especially for children, and\nhow much of that is based on true kind of like\nmaladaptive kinds of tendencies. But what we do know is this,\nis that ADHD is associated with differences in prefrontal function so that attention can be both more, you're more distractible,\nyou have harder time focusing your attention on what's relevant, and so you shift too easily. But then once you get on something that you're interested\nin, you can get stuck. And so, you know, the attention\nis this beautiful balance of being able to focus\nwhen you need to focus and shift when you need to shift. And so it's that flexibility\nplus stability again. And that balance seems\nto be disrupted in ADHD. And so, as a result, memory\ntends to be poor in ADHD, but it's not necessarily because there's a\ntraditional memory problem, but it's more because of\nthis attentional issue. Right? And so... And people with ADHD often\nwill have great memory for the things that they're interested in and just no memory for the things that\nthey're not interested in. - Is there advice from your\nown life on how to learn and succeed from that? From just how the\ncharacteristics of your own brain with ADHD and so on, how do you learn, how do you remember information? How do you flourish in this\nsort of education context? - I'm still trying to figure\nout the flourishing per se, but education, I mean, being in science is enormously enabling of ADHD. It's like you're constantly\nlooking for new things, you're constantly seeking\nthat dopamine hit. And that's great, you know. And they tolerate you're\nbeing late for things. Nothing is really, nobody's\ngonna die if you screw up. You know, it's just nice. It's not like being a doctor or something where you have to be like much\nmore responsible and focused. You can just freely follow your curiosity, which is just great. But what I'd say is, is\nthat like I'm learning now about so many things, like\nabout how to structure my activities more and basically say, \"Okay, if I'm going to be...\" Email's like the big one\nthat kills me right now, I'm just constantly like\nshifting between email and my activities. And what happens is, is that I\ndon't actually get the email. I just look at my email and I get stressed 'cause I'm like, \"Oh, I\nhave to think about this. Let me get back to it.\" And I go back to something else. And so I've just got fragmentary\nmemories of everything. Right? So what I'm trying to\ndo is set aside a time where like this is my email time, this is my, you know, writing time, this is my goofing off time, and so blocking these things off. Give yourself the goofing off time. Sometimes I do that. And sometimes I have to be flexible and go like, \"Okay, I'm\ndefinitely not focusing. I'm going to give myself the downtime.\" And it's an investment,\nit's not like wasting time. It's an investment in\nmy attention later on. - And I'm very much with\nCal Newport on this, he wrote \"Deep Work,\" and a\nlot of other amazing books. He talks about task switching\nas a sort of the thing that really destroys productivity. So like, you know, switching... Well it doesn't even\nmatter from what to what, but checking social media,\nchecking email, maybe switching to a phone call and then doing\nwork and then switching... Even switching between if\nyou're reading a paper, switching from paper to paper to paper. - Yeah.\n- Because like curiosity and whatever the dopamine hit\nfrom the attention switch, like limiting that 'cause\notherwise your brain is just not capable to\nreally like load it in and really do that deep\ndeliberation I think that's required to remember things and to\nreally think through things. - Yeah, I mean, you probably\nsee this, I imagine, in AI conferences, but definitely in\nneuroscience conferences, it's now the norm that\npeople have their laptops out during talks and, you know,\nconceivably they're writing, you know, they're writing notes. But in fact, what often\nhappens if you look at people, and we can speak from a little\nbit of personal experience, is you're checking\nemail and you're like... Or I'm working on my own talk. But often it's like, you're doing things that are not paying... And I have this illusion,\n\"Well, I'm paying attention.\" And then I'm going back. And then what happens is\nI don't remember anything from that day, it just kind of vanished. Because what happens is I'm creating all these artificial event boundaries. I'm losing all this executive function. Every time I switch, I'm getting\nlike a few seconds slower and I'm catching up mentally\nto what's happening. And so instead of being in a model where you're meaningfully\nintegrating everything and predicting and generating\nthis kind of like rich model, I'm just catching up. You know? And so yeah, there's great\nresearch by Molina Uncapher and Anthony Wagner on multitasking, that people can look up,\nthat talks about just how bad it is for memory and,\nyou know, it's becoming worse and worse of a problem."

      "section": "Music",
      "text": "- So you're a musician, take me through how'd you get into music? Like what made you first\nfall in love with music, with creating music? - I, yeah, so I started playing\nmusic just when I was like doing trumpet in school for school band and I would just read music and play. And, you know, I was pretty decent at it. Not great, but I was decent. - How'd you go from trumpet to- - Guitar?\n- To guitar? Especially the kind of music you're into? - Yeah, so basically in high school... Yeah, so I kind of was\na late bloomer to music, but just kind of MTV grew up with me. I grew up with MTV and so\nthen you started seeing all this stuff and then I got into... Metal was kind of like my early genre and I always reacted to\njust things that were loud and had a beat like... I mean, ADHD, right? It's like, you know,\neverything from \"Sgt. Peppers\" by The Beatles to like \"Led\nZeppelin II,\" my dad had. My parents had both those albums, so I'd listen to them a lot. And then like The Police,\n\"Ghost in the Machine.\" But then I got into metal Def Leppard and, you know, AC/DC, Metallica, went way down the rabbit\nhole of speed metal. And that time was kind of like, \"Oh, like why don't I play guitar? I can do this.\" And I had friends who were doing that and I just never got it. Like I was, I took lessons\nand stuff like that, but it was different because\nwhen I was doing trumpet I was reading sheet music and this was like, I\nwas learning by looking. There's a thing called\ntablature, you know this, where it's like you see like\na drawing of the fretboard with numbers and that's where\nyou're supposed to put your... It's kinda like paint by numbers, right? And so I learned it in a\ncompletely different way, but I was still terrible\nat it and I didn't get it. It's actually taken me a long time to understand exactly what the issue was. But it wasn't until I really got into punk and I saw bands, like I saw Sonic Youth, I remember especially,\nand it just blew my mind because they violated the\nrules of what I thought music was supposed to be. I was like, \"This doesn't sound right, these are not power chords, and this doesn't just\nhave like a shouty verse and then a chorus part. It's not going back. This is just like weird.\" And then it occurred to me,\nyou don't have to write music the way people tell you\nit's supposed to sound. That just opened up everything for me. And I was playing in a band and I was struggling with writing music because I would try to write like, you know, whatever\nwas popular at the time, or whatever sounded like other bands that I was listening to. And somehow I kind of\nmorphed into just like, just grabbing a guitar\nand just doing stuff. And I realized a part of\nmy problem with doing music before was I didn't enjoy\ntrying to play stuff that other people played. I just enjoyed music\njust dripping out of me and just, you know, spilling\nout and just doing stuff. And so then I started to say, \"What if I don't play a chord? What if I just play like notes\nthat shouldn't go together and just mess around with stuff?\" Then I said, \"Well what if\nI don't do four beats going, nah, nah, nah, nah. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. What if I go one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five?\" And started messing around\nwith time signatures. Then I was playing in this\nband with a great musician who was really... Brent Ritzel, who was\nin this band with me, and he taught me about arranging songs. And it was like, \"What\nif we take this part and instead of make it\ngo like back and forth we make it like a circle, or what if we make it like\na straight line, you know, or a zigzag, you know, just\nmake it like non-linear in these interesting ways?\" And then the next thing you\nknow it's like the whole world sort of opens up as like the... And then what I started\nto realize, especially... So you could appreciate\nthis as a musician, I think, so time signatures, right? So we are so brainwashed to\nthink in four four, right? Every rock song you can think\nof almost is in four four. I know you're a Floyd fan, so think of \"Money\" by Pink Floyd, right? - [Lex] Yeah. (Charan vocalizing) - [Lex] Yeah. - You feel like it's in four four because it resolves itself, but it resolves on the last note of... Basically it resolves on the\nfirst note of the next measure. So it's got seven beats instead of eight where the riff is actually happening. - [Lex] Interesting. - But you're thinking in four, because that's how we're used thinking. So the music flows a little bit\nfaster than it's supposed to and you're getting a little\nbit of prediction error every time this is happening. And once I got used to that, I was like, \"I hate writing at four four.\" Because I was like,\n\"Everything just feels better if I do it in seven four, or if I alternate between four and three.\" And doing all this stuff. And then it's like you just... And, you know, jazz music is like that. You know, they just do so much\ninteresting stuff with this. - So playing with those\ntime signatures allows you to like really break\nit all open and just... I guess there's something\nabout that where it allows you to actually have fun. - Yeah, yeah. And it's like... So I'm actually like a very... One of the genres we used\nto play in was Math Rock, was what they called it. It was just like, this has so\nmany weird time signatures. - What is math... Oh, interesting. - [Charan] Yeah, so. - That's the math part of\nrock is what the mathematical disturbances of it, or what? - Yeah, I guess it would\nbe like, so instead of you might go like instead\nof playing four beats in every measure... (Charan vocalizing) You go... (Charan vocalizing) You know? And that's just do these things. And then you might\narrange it in weird ways so that there might be three measures of verse and then one, you know, and then five measures of\nchorus, and then two measures... So you could just mess\naround with everything. Right? - What does that feel like to listen to? There's something about\nsymmetry, or like patterns, that feel good and like\nrelaxing for us or whatever. It feels like home. And disturbing that can\nbe quite disturbing. - Yeah.\n- So is is that... Is that the feeling you\nwould have if you were keep messing with Math Rock? I mean, I- - Yeah, yeah.\n- That's stressing me out just listening. - Well, yeah, yeah.\n- Learning about it. - So, I mean, it depends. So a lot of my style of songwriting is very much like in terms\nof like repetitive themes, but messing around with structure. 'cause I'm not a great\nguitarist, technically, and so I don't play complicated stuff. And there's things that you can hear stuff where it's just like so\ncomplicated, you know? But often what I find is,\nis like having a melody and then adding some\ndissonance to it, just enough, and then adding some complexity that gets you going just enough. But I have a high tolerance for that kind of\ndissonance and prediction. I think, I have a theory, a pet theory, that it's like basically you can explain most of human behavior as\nsome people are lumpers and some people are splitters, you know? And so it's like some people are very kind of excited\nwhen they get this dissonance and they wanna like go\nwith it, and some people are just like, \"No, I wanna lump every...\" You know, I don't know, maybe\nthat's even a different thing, but it's like, basically it's like, I think some people get\nscared of that discomfort. - Yeah.\n- And I really- - Thrive on it.\n- Gravitate towards it. You know?\n- I love it. What's the name of your band now? - The cover band I play in is\na band called Pavlov's Dogz. And so... - Yeah. - So it's a band, unsurprisingly, of mostly memory\nresearchers, neuroscientists. - I love this. - And so-\n- I love this so much. - Yeah, actually one\nof your MIT colleagues, Earl Miller plays bass. - He plays bass? So you play... Like, do you play with him, or- - So you could compete if you want. Maybe we could audition you. - For audition. Oh, yeah. I'm coming for you, Earl. (Charan laughing) - Earl's gonna-\n- I'm coming for your spot. - Earl's gonna kill me. He is like very precise the way- - I'll play triangle or something. (Charan laughing) Or is it, a cowbell? Yeah, I'll be the cowbell guy. And you guys, what kind\nof songs do you guys do? - So it's mostly late seventies\npunk and eighties New Wave and post-punk Blondie, Ramones, Clash. I do, I sing \"Age of Consent\" by New Order and \"Love Will Tear Us Apart.\" - [Lex] And you said you\nhave a female singer now? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kari Hoffman and also Paula Croxson. And so they do, they do, yeah. So Kari does Blondie amazingly well and we do like \"Gigantic\" by the Pixies. Paula does that one. - Which song do you love to play the most? What kind of song is super fun for you? - Of someone else's? - Yeah, a cover. Yeah. - A cover? Okay, and it's one we\ndo with Pavlov's Dogz? - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - I really enjoy playing,\n\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\" by Iggy and The Stooges. - [Lex] Yeah, that's a good song. - Which is perfect 'cause\nwe're Pavlov's Dogz. - [Lex] Yeah. - And Pavlov of course was like, basically created learning theory. So, you know, there's that. But also it's like... But I mean Iggy and The\nStooges, that song, so I play and sing on it, but it's just like, it devolves into total noise and I just like fall on the\nfloor and generate feedback. I've like, I think in the last\nversion it might have been that or a Velvet Underground\ncover in our last show. I actually, I have a guitar\nmade of aluminum that I got made and I thought this thing's indestructible and so I kind of like was just,\nyou know, moving it around, had it upside down and all this\nstuff to generate feedback. And I think I broke one of the... I broke one of the tuning pegs and- - Oh, wow.\n- Yeah, so I managed... I managed a break an all metal guitar. Oof, go figure."

      "text": "- A bit of a big ridiculous\nquestion, but let me ask you, we've been talking about\nneuroscience in general. What do you... You've been studying the\nhuman mind for a long time. What do you love most\nabout the human mind? Like when you look at\nit, we look at the FMRI, just the scans and the behavioral stuff, the electrodes, you know,\nthe psychology aspect, reading the literature\non the biology side, neurobiology, all of it. When you look at it, what is\nmost like beautiful to you? - I think the most beautiful but incredibly hard to put your finger on is this idea of the internal model. That it's like there's everything you see and there's everything you hear,\ntouch, and taste, you know, every breath you take, whatever, but it's all connected\nby this like dark energy that's holding that whole universe of your mind together, right? And without that it's\njust a bunch of stuff. And somehow we put that together and it forms so much of our experience. And being able to figure\nout where that comes from and how things are connected\nto me is just amazing. But just this idea of like\nthat the world in front of us, we're only sampling this little bit and trying to take so\nmuch meaning from it. And we do a really good job. Not perfect, I mean, you know. But that ability to me is just amazing. - Yeah, it's an incredible\nmystery, all of it. It's funny you said dark energy 'cause the same in astrophysics,\nyou look out there, you look at dark matter and dark energy, which is this loose\nterm assigned to a thing we don't understand, which\nhelps make the equations work in terms of gravity and the\nexpansion of the universe, in the same way. It seems like there's that\nkind of thing in the human mind that we're like striving to understand. - Yeah, yeah. You know, it's funny\nthat you mentioned that. So one of the reasons I wrote the book, amongst many, is that I\nreally felt like people needed to hear from scientists. And like COVID was just\na great example of this, because like people weren't\nhearing from scientists. One of the things I think\nthat people didn't get was the uncertainty of science\nand how much we don't know. And I think every scientist lives in this world of uncertainty. And when I was writing the\nbook I just became aware of all of these things we don't know. And so I think of physics a lot and I think of this idea of\nlike overwhelming majority of the stuff that's in our universe cannot be directly measured. I used to think, \"Ha ha,\nI hate physics though.\" Physicists get the Nobel Prize for doing whatever stupid thing. It's like there's 10 physicists out there. I'm just kidding. Just-\n- Strong words. - Yeah, no, no, no, I'm kidding. It's just the physicists\nwho do neuroscience can be rather opinionated so sometimes I like to dish on that. - [Lex] It's all love. - It's all love, that's right. This is the ADHD talking. So... But at some point I had this\naha moment where I was like to be aware of that\nmuch that we don't know, and have a beat on it and\nbe able to go towards it, that's one of the biggest\nscientific successes that I could think of. You are aware that you don't know about this gigantic section, overwhelming majority\nof the universe, right? And I think the more what keeps me going to some extent is realizing\nthe changing the scope of the problem and figuring out, \"Oh my God, there's all\nthese things we don't know.\" And I thought I knew this, 'cause science is all\nabout assumptions, right? So have you ever read \"The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions\" by Thomas Kuhn? - Yes.\n- That's like my only philosophy really that I've read. But it's so brilliant in the\nway that they frame this idea of like, he frames this\nidea of assumptions being core to the scientific\nprocess, and the paradigm shift comes from changing those assumptions. And this idea of like finding\nout this kind of whole zone of what you don't know to me\nis the exciting part, you know? - Well you are a great scientist and you wrote an incredible book. So thank you for doing that. And thank you for talking today. You've decreased the amount\nof uncertainty I have, just a tiny little bit today, and revealed the beauty of memory. This was a fascinating conversation. Thank you for talking today. - Oh, thank you. This has been a blast. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Charan Ranganath. To support this podcast\nplease check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Haruki Murakami, \"Most\nthings are forgotten over time, even the war itself. The life and death struggle\npeople went through is now like something\nfrom the distant past. We're so caught up in our everyday lives that events of the past\nare no longer in orbit around our minds, there\nare just too many things we have to think about every day, too many new things we have to learn. But still, no matter how much time passes, no matter what takes place in the interim, there are some things we can\nnever assign to oblivion, memories we can never rub away. They remain with us\nforever, like a touchstone.\" Thank you for listening, and\nI hope to see you next time."

  "full_text": "- The act of remembering\ncan change the memory. If you remember some event, and then I tell you\nsomething about the event, later on when you remember\nthe event you might remember some original information from the event, as well as some information\nabout what I told you. And sometimes if you're not\nable to tell the difference, that information that\nI told you gets mixed into the story that you had originally. So now I give you some\nmore misinformation, or you're exposed to some more information somewhere else, and eventually your memory becomes totally detached\nfrom what happened. - The following is a conversation\nwith Charan Ranganath, a psychologist and\nneuroscientist at UC Davis specializing in human memory. He's the author of \"Why We Remember: Unlocking Memory's Power to\nHold on to What Matters.\" This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Charan Ranganath. Danny Kahneman describes\nthe experiencing self and the remembering self and that happiness and\nsatisfaction you gain from the outcomes of your\ndecisions do not come from what you've experienced, but rather from what you\nremember of the experience. So can you speak to this\ninteresting difference that you write about in your book, of the experiencing self\nand the remembering self? - Danny really impacted me,\n'cause I was an undergrad at Berkeley and I got to\ntake a class from him, long before he won the\nNobel Prize or anything. And it was just a mind blowing class. But this idea of the remembering self and the experiencing self, I got into it because\nit's so much about memory, even though he doesn't study memory. So we're right now having\nthis experience, right? And people can watch it\npresumably on YouTube, or listen to it on audio, but if you're talking to somebody else, you could probably describe\nthis whole thing in 10 minutes. But that's going to miss a\nlot of what actually happened. And so the idea there is\nis that the way we remember things is not the replay\nof the experience, it's something totally different, and it tends to be biased by\nthe beginning and the end, and he talks about the peaks, but there's also the, you\nknow, the the best parts, the worst parts, et cetera. And those are the things that we remember. And so when we make decisions,\nwe usually consult memory and we feel like our memory is a record of what we've experienced, but it's not, it's this\nkind of very biased sample, but it's biased in an interesting and, I think, biologically relevant way. - So in the way we construct\na narrative about our past, you say that it gives us\nan illusion of stability. Can you explain that? - Basically I think that a\nlot of learning in the brain is driven towards being\nable to make sense. I mean really memory is\nall about the present and the future. The past is done, so,\nbiologically speaking, it's not important, unless there's something\nfrom the past that's useful. And so what our brains\nare really optimized for is to learn about\nthe stuff from the past that's going to be most useful\nin understanding the present and predicting the future. Right? And so cause-effect\nrelationships for instance, that's a big one. Now my future is completely unpredictable in the sense that like\nyou could, you know, in the next 10 minutes pull a knife on me and slit my throat. Right? - I was planning on it. - Exactly. But having seen some of your work and just, you know, generally\nmy expectations about life, I'm not expecting that. I have a certainty that\neverything's gonna be fine, we're gonna have a great\ntime talking today. Right? But we're often right. It's like, okay, so I go\nto see a band on stage, you know, I know they're\ngonna make me wait, the show's gonna start late and then, you know, they come on, there's a very good chance\nthere's gonna be an encore. I have a memory, so to\nspeak, for that event before I've even walked into the show. Right? There's gonna be people\nholding up their camera phones to try to take videos of it now, 'cause this is kind of\nthe world we live in. So that's like everyday fortune telling that we do though. It's not real, it's imagined. And it's amazing that\nwe have this capability, and that's what memory is about. But it can also give us the\nillusion that we know everything that's about to happen. And I think what's valuable\nabout that illusion is when it's broken it\ngives us the information. Right? So I mean, you know, I'm\nsure being in AI you know about information theory. And the idea is the information is what you didn't already have. And so those prediction errors\nthat we make based on... You know, we make a\nprediction based on memory, and the errors are where the action is. - The error is where the learning happens? - Exactly. Exactly. - Well just to linger on Danny Kahneman, and just this whole idea\nof experiencing self versus remembering self,\nI was hoping you can give a simple answer of how we should live life based on the fact that our\nmemories could be a source of happiness, or could be the\nprimary source of happiness. That an event, when experienced,\nbears its fruits the most when it's remembered over\nand over and over and over. And maybe there is some wisdom in the fact that we can\ncontrol, to some degree, how we remember it, how\nwe evolve our memory of it such that it can maximize\nthe long-term happiness of that repeated experience. - Okay, well first I'll\nsay, I wish I could take you on the road with me, because that was such a great description. - Can I be your opening act, or... - Oh my god, no, I'm\ngonna open for you, dude. Otherwise it's like, you\nknow, everybody leaves after you're done. (both laughing) Believe me, I did that\nin Columbus, Ohio once. It wasn't fun. Like the opening acts\nlike drank our bar tab. We spent all this money\ngoing all the way there, there was only the... Everybody left after the\nopening acts were done and there was just that stoner dude with the dreadlocks hanging out. And then next thing you know\nwe blew like our savings on getting a hotel room. - So we should, as a small tangent, you are a legit touring act? - When I was in grad\nschool I played in a band and, yeah, we traveled,\nwe would play shows. It wasn't like... We weren't a hardcore touring band, but we did some touring\nand had some fun times. And, yeah, we did a movie soundtrack. - Nice. - \"Henry: Portrait of Serial Killer.\" So that's a good movie. We were on the soundtrack for the sequel, \"Henry 2: Mask of Sanity,\"\nwhich is a terrible movie. - Yeah. How's the soundtrack? Is it pretty good?\n- It's badass. - All right.\n- At least that one part where the guy throws up the milkshake. - Okay, all right.\n- Which is my song. - We're gonna have to see. We're gonna have to see it. - [Charan] All right, we'll\nget you back to life advice- - And happiness, yeah. - One thing that I try to\nlive by, especially nowadays, and since I wrote the\nbook I've been thinking more and more about this, is how do I want to live a memorable life? You know, I think if we go back\nto like the pandemic, right? How many people have\nmemories from that period? Aside from the trauma of\nbeing, you know, locked up and seeing people die, and all this stuff. I think it's like one of these\nthings where we were stuck inside looking at screens all day, doing the same thing with the same people, and so I don't remember much from that in terms\nof those good memories that you're talking about. Right? You know, when I was\ngrowing up my parents worked really hard for us and, you\nknow, we went on some vacations, but not very often. And I really try to do now\nvacations to interesting places as much as possible with my family because like those are the\nthings that you remember, right? So I really do think\nabout what's going to be like something that's memorable, and then just do it, even\nif it's a pain in the ass, because the experiencing self will suffer for that, but the remembering\nself will be like, \"Yes, I'm so glad I did that.\" - Do things that are very\nunpleasant in the moment, because those can be reframed and enjoyed for many years to come. That's probably... Good advice. Or at least when you're going\nthrough shit it's a good way to see the silver lining of it. - Yeah, I mean I think\nit's one of these things where if you have like people\nwho you've gone through. I mean, since you said it, I'll just... Since you've gone through\nshit with someone. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it's like, that's a\nbonding experience often. You know? I mean that can really bring you together. I like to say it's like\nthere's no point in suffering unless you get a story out of it. (Charan laughing) So in the book I talk about the power of the way we communicate with others and how that shapes our memories. And so I had this near death experience, at least that's how I remember it, on this paddle board where just everything that could have gone wrong\ndid go wrong, almost. So many mistakes were made and\nended up, like at some point, just like basically away from\nmy board pinned in a current, like in this corner, like\nnot a super good swimmer. And my friend who came with me, Randy, who's a computational neuroscientist, and he had just been pushed down past me and so he couldn't even see me. And I'm just like, \"If I die\nhere, you know, I mean no one's around, it's like you just die alone.\" And so I just said, \"Well,\nfailure's not an option.\" And eventually I got out of\nit and froze, and got cut up. I mean the things that\nwe were going through were just insane. But short version of this\nis, you know, my wife and my daughter, and\nRandy's wife, they gave us all sorts of hell about this, 'cause they were just like, where are... They were ready to send\nout a search party. So they were giving me hell\nabout it, and then I started to tell people in my lab\nabout this, and then friends, and it just became a better\nand better story every time. And we actually had some photos of just the crazy things. Like this generator that\nwas hanging over the water and we're like ducking under the zig of these metal gratings,\nand I'm like going flat. And it was just nuts, you know? But it became a great story. And it was definitely... I mean, Randy and I were already tight, but that was a real\nbonding experience for us. And, yeah... I mean, and I learned from that\nthat it's like I don't look back on that enough actually, because I think we often, at least for me, I don't necessarily have\nthe confidence to think that things will work out, that I'll be able to get\nthrough a certain thing. But my ability to actually\nget something done in that moment is better\nthan I give myself credit for, I think. And that was the lesson of that story that I really took away. - Well, actually, just for\nme, you're making me realize now that it's not just\nthose kinds of stories, but even things like\nperiods of depression, or really low points. To me at least it feels\nlike a motivating thing that the darker it gets,\nthe better the story will be if you emerge on the other side. That, to me, feels like\na motivating thing. So maybe if people are listening to this and they're going through\nsome shit, as we said, one thing that could be a source of light is that it'll be a hell of a good story when it's all over, when you\nemerge on the other side. Let me ask you about decisions. You've already talked\nabout it a little bit, but when we face the world and we're making different decisions, how much does our memory come into play? Is it the kind of narratives\nthat we've constructed about the world that are\nused to make predictions that's fundamentally part\nof the decision making? - Absolutely, yeah. So let's say after this you and I decided we're gonna go for a beer, right? How do you choose where to go? You're probably gonna be\nlike, \"Oh, yeah, this new bar opened up near me, I\nhad a great time there, they had a great beer selection.\" Or you might say, \"Oh,\nwe went to this place and it was totally crowded\nand they were playing this horrible EDM or whatever.\" And so right there, valuable\nsource of information, right? And then you have these\nthings like where you do this counterfactual stuff like, \"Well I did this previously, but what if I had gone\nsomewhere else instead? Maybe I'll go to this other place because I didn't try\nit the previous time.\" So there's all that kind of\nreasoning that goes into it too. I think even if you think\nabout the big decisions in life, right? It's like you and I were talking\nbefore we started recording about how I got into memory\nresearch and you got into AI and it's like we all have\nthese personal reasons that guide us in these\nparticular directions. And some of it's the environment\nand random factors in life and some of it is memories of\nthings that we wanna overcome, or things that we build\non in a positive way. But either way they define us. - And probably the earlier\nin life the memories happen the more defining power they have in terms of determining who we become. - I mean, I do feel like\nadolescence is much more important than I think people give credit for. I think that there is this\nkind of a sense like, you know, the first three years of life\nis the most important part, but the teenage years\nare just so important for the brain, you know? And so that's where a\nlot of mental illness starts to emerge. You know, now we're thinking\nof things like schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disorder because it just emerges during that period of adolescence and early adulthood. So... And I think the other part\nof it is, is that, you know, as, I guess I was a little\nbit too firm in saying that memory determines who we are. It's really the self is\nan evolving construct. I think we kind of underestimate that. And when you're a parent\nyou feel like every decision you make is consequential\nin forming this child. And it plays a role, but\nso do the child's peers. And so do you know, there's so much... I mean, that's why I think\nthe big part of education I think that's so important\nis not the content you learn. I mean, think of how much dumb\nstuff we learned in school. Right? But a lot of it is learning\nhow to get along with people, and learning who you are,\nand how you function. And, you know, that can\nbe terribly traumatizing even if you have perfect, you\nknow, parents working on you. - Is there some insight\ninto the human brain that explains why we\ndon't seem to remember anything from the first few years of life? - Yeah, yeah. In fact, actually I was just talking to my really good friend and\ncolleague, Simona Ghetti, who studies the neuroscience\nof child development. And so we were talking about this. And so there are a bunch\nof reasons I would say. So one reason is, is\nthere's an area of the brain called the hippocampus,\nwhich is very, very important for remembering events,\nor episodic memory. And so the first two years\nof life there's a period called infantile amnesia. And then the next couple of years of life after that, there's a period\ncalled childhood amnesia. And the difference is is\nthat basically in the lab and, you know, even during\nchildhood and afterwards, children basically don't\nhave any episodic memories for those first two years. The next two years it's very fragmentary, and that's why they call\nit childhood amnesia. So there's some, but it's not much. So one reason is that the\nhippocampus is taking some time to develop, but another is the neocortex, so the whole folded stuff\nof gray matter all around the hippocampus, is developing so rapidly and changing and a child's\nknowledge of the world is just massively being built up, right? So I mean, I'm gonna\nprobably embarrass myself, but it's like if you showed\nlike, you know, you trained a neural network and you\ngive it like the first couple of patterns, or something like\nthat, and then you bombard it with another like, you\nknow, years worth of data, try to get back those first\ncouple of patterns, right? It's like everything changes. And so the brain is so plastic, the cortex is so plastic during that time. And we think that memories for\nevents are very distributed across the brain. So imagine you're trying to get back that pattern of activity that happened during this one moment, but\nthe roads that you would take to get there have been\ncompletely rerouted, right? So I think that's my best explanation. The third explanation is\na child's sense of self takes a while to develop. And so their experience of\nlearning might be more learning what happened as opposed\nto having this first person experience of, \"I remember, I was there.\" - Well I think somebody once said to me that, kind of loosely, philosophically, that the reason we don't\nremember the first few years of life, infantile amnesia, is\nbecause how traumatic it is. Basically the error\nrate that you mentioned, when your brain's prediction\ndoesn't match reality, the error rate in the\nfirst few years of life, your first few months certainly,\nis probably crazy high. It's just nonstop freaking out. The collision between\nyour model of the world and how the world works is just so high that you want whatever the trauma of that is not to linger around. I always thought that's\nan interesting idea because like, just imagine the\ninsanity of what's happening in a human brain in\nthe first couple years. Just, you don't know anything, and then there's just\nthis stream of knowledge and we're somehow, given\nhow plastic everything is, it just kind of molds and figures it out. But it's like an insane\nwaterfall of information. - I wouldn't necessarily\ndescribe it as a trauma, and we can get into this\nwhole stages of life thing, which I just love. Basically those first few\nyears there are, I mean, you know, I mean think about\nit, a kid's internal model of their body is changing, right? It's like just learning to move. I mean like, you know, if you\never have a baby you'll know that like the first three months they're discovering their toes. Right? It's just nuts. So everything is changing. But what's really fascinating is, and I think this is one of those... This is not at all me being a scientist, but it's like one of those\nthings that people talk about when they talk about the,\nyou know, positive aspects of children is that they're\nexceptionally curious and they have this kind of\nopenness towards the world. And so that prediction error is not a negative, traumatic thing. I think it's like a very positive thing because it's what they use,\nthey're seeking information. One of the areas that I'm very interested in is the prefrontal cortex. It's an area of the brain that... I mean, I could talk all day about it, but it helps us use our knowledge to say, \"Hey, this is what I want\nto do now, this is my goal, so this is how I'm going to achieve it.\" And focus everything\ntowards that goal, right? The prefrontal cortex takes\nforever to develop in humans. The connections are still being tweaked and reformed like into late\nadolescence, early adulthood, which is when you tend to see\nmental illness pop up, right? So it's being massively reformed. Then you have about 10 years,\nmaybe, of prime functioning of the prefrontal cortex and\nthen it starts going down again and you end up being older and you start losing all\nthat frontal function. So I look at this and\nyou'd say, okay, from... You sit around episodic memory talks, we'll always say children\nare worse than adults at episodic memory, older adults\nare worse than young adults at episodic memory. And I always would say,\n\"God, this is so weird, why would we have this period\nof time that's so short when we're perfect?\" Right? Or optimal. And I like to use the word optimal now because there's such a culture\nof optimization right now. And it's like, I realize I have\nto redefine what optimal is because for most of the human condition I think we had a series of stages of life where you have basically\nadults saying, \"Okay,\" young adults saying, \"I've got a child and, you know, I'm part of this village and I have to hunt and\nforage and get things done. I need a prefrontal cortex so I can stay focused on the big picture and the long haul goals.\" Now I'm a child, I'm in this\nvillage, I'm kinda wandering around and I've got some safety and I need to learn about this culture because I know so little. What's the best way to do that? Let's explore. I don't wanna be constrained\nby goals as much. I wanna really be free,\nplay, and explore, and learn. So you don't want a super\ntight prefrontal cortex. You don't even know what\nthe goals should be yet. Right? It's like if you're\ntrying to design a model that's based on a bad goal, it's not gonna work well, right? So then you go late in life and you say, \"Oh, why don't you have a\ngreat prefrontal cortex then?\" But I think, I mean if you go back and you think how many\nspecies actually stick around naturally long after\ntheir childbearing years are over, after the\nreproductive years are over? Like menopause. From what I understand,\nmenopause is not all that common in the animal world, right? So why would that happen? And so I saw Alison Gopnik\nsaid something about this, so I started to look into\nthis, about this idea that, you know, really when\nyou're older, in most societies, your job is no longer to\nform new episodic memories, it's to pass on the memories\nthat you already have, this knowledge about the world, what we call semantic memory, to pass on that semantic memory\nto the younger generations, pass on the culture. You know, even now in indigenous cultures, that's the role of the elders. And they're respected, they're not seen as, you know, people who\nare past it and losing it. And I thought that was\na very poignant thing, that memory's doing what it's supposed to throughout these stages of life. - So it is always optimal in a sense. - Yeah.\n- It's just optimal for that stage of life. - Yeah, and for the ecology of the system. So you've got... So I looked into this and\nit's like another species that has menopause is orcas. Orca pods are led by\nthe grandmothers, right? So not the young adults,\nnot the parents or whatever, the grandmothers. And so they're the ones\nthat pass on the traditions to the, I guess, the\nyounger generation of orcas. And if you, you know, if you look, from what little I understand, different orca pods have\ndifferent traditions, they hunt for different things, they have different play traditions, and that's a culture, right? And so in social animals\nevolution, I think, is designing brains that are really around, you know, it's obviously optimized for the individual but also for kin. And I think that the kin are part of this, like when they're a part of\nthis intense social group, the brain development\nshould parallel that, the nature of the ecology. - Well it is just fascinating to think of the individual orca, or\nhuman, throughout his life in stages doing a kind of\noptimal wisdom development. So in the early days you don't\neven know what the goal is, then you figure out the goal and you kind of optimize for that goal and you pursue that goal. And then all the wisdom you collect through that, then you share\nwith the others in the system, with the other individuals, and as a collective then\nyou kind of converge towards greater wisdom throughout the generation. So in that sense it's optimal. Us humans and orcas\ngot something going on. It works.\n- Oh, yeah. Apex predators. - I just got a megalodon tooth,\nspeaking of apex predators. - Oh, man! - It's... Just imagine the size of that thing. Anyway, how does the brain forget and how and why does it remember? So maybe some of the mechanisms? You mentioned the hippocampus, what are the different\ncomponents involved here? - So we could think about\nthis on a number of levels. Maybe I'll give you the\nsimplest version first, which is we tend to think of memories as these individual things\nand we can just access them, maybe a little bit like, you\nknow, photos on your phone, or something like that. But in the brain, the way it works is you have this distributed pool of neurons and the\nmemories are kind of shared across different pools of neurons. And so what you have is competition, where sometimes memories\nthat overlap can be fighting against each other, right? So sometimes we forget because that competition\njust wipes things out. Sometimes we forget because there aren't\nthe biological signals, which we can get into, I would promote long-term retention. And lots of times we forget because we can't find the\ncue that sends us back to the right memory. And we need the right cue to\nbe able to activate it, right? So, you know, for instance,\nin a neural network there is no... You wouldn't go and you'd\nsay, \"This is the memory.\" Right? It's like the whole network,\nI mean the whole ecosystem of memories is in the weights\nof the neural network. And in fact you could\nextract entirely new memories depending on how you feed. - You have to have the right\nquery, the right prompt, to access that whatever the\npart you're looking for. - That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And in humans you have\nthis more complex set of ways memory works. There's, as I said, the knowledge, or what you call semantic memory, and then there's these\nmemories for specific events, which we call episodic memory. And so there's different\npieces of the puzzle that require different kinds of cues. So that's a big part of it too, is just this kind of what\nwe call retrieval failure. - You mentioned episodic memory, you mentioned semantic memory. What are the different separations here? What's what working\nmemory, short-term memory, long-term memory, what are the interesting\ncategories of memory? - Yeah. And so memory researchers,\nwe love to cut things up and say, you know, is memory\none thing or is it two things? Is it two things, or is it three things? And so one of the things that... There's value in that, and\nespecially experimental value in terms of being able to dissect things. In the real world, it's all connected. Speaking to your question,\nworking memory is a term that was coined by Alan Baddeley. It's basically thought to be this ability to keep information online in your mind right in front of you at a given time, and to be able to control\nthe flow of that information, to choose what information is relevant, to be able to manipulate it, and so forth. And one of the things that Alan\ndid that was quite brilliant was he said, there's this ability\nto kind of passively store information, you know, see\nthings in your mind's eye, or hear your internal monologue. But, you know, we have that ability to keep information in mind, but then we also have this\nseparate, what he called, a central executive, which is identified a lot\nwith the prefrontal cortex, it's this ability to control\nthe flow of information that's being kept active based\non what it is you're doing. Now a lot of my early\nwork was basically saying that this working memory, which some memory researchers\nwould call short-term memory, is not at all independent\nfrom long-term memory. That is that a lot of executive\nfunction requires learning and you have to have like synaptic change for that to happen. And... But there's also\ntransient forms of memory. So one of the things I've\nbeen getting into lately is the idea that we form\ninternal models of events. The obvious one that I always use is birthday parties, right? So you go to a child's birthday party, once the cake comes out and they start, you just see a candle, you\ncan predict the whole frame, you know, set of events\nthat happens later. And up till that point where\nthe child blows out the candle, you have an internal model in\nyour head of what's going on. And so if you follow people's eyes, it's not actually on what's happening, it's going where the\naction's about to happen. Which is just fascinating, right? So you have this internal model and that's a kind of a\nworking memory product. It's something that you're keeping online that's allowing you to\ninterpret this world around you. Now to build that model though\nyou need to pull out stuff from your general knowledge of the world, which is what we call semantic memory, and then you'd wanna be\nable to pull out memories for specific events that\nhappened in the past, which we call episodic memory. So in a way they're all connected, even though it's different, the things that we're focusing on, and the way we organize\ninformation in the present, which is working memory, will\nplay a big role in determining how we remember that information later, which people typically\ncall long-term memory. - So if you have something\nlike a birthday party, and you've been to many\nbefore, you're gonna load that from disc into\nworking memory, this model, and then you're mostly\noperating on the model. And if it's a new task,\nyou don't have a model so you're more in the data collection? - Yes. One of the fascinating things\nthat we've been studying, and this is, we're not at\nall the first to do this, Jeff Zacks was a big pioneer in this, and I've been working\nwith many other people, Ken Norman, Lila Davachi, NY or Columbia, has done some interesting\nstuff with this, is this idea that we form these internal\nmodels at particular points of high prediction error, or points of, I believe\nalso points of uncertainty, points of surprise, or\nmotivationally significant periods, and those points are when\nit's maximally optimal to encode an episodic memory. So I used to think, \"Oh,\nwell we're just encoding episodic memories constantly,\nboom, boom, boom, boom, boom.\" But think about how much redundancy there is in all that, right? It's just a lot of information\nthat you don't need. But if you capture an episodic memory at the point of maximum uncertainty for the singular experience, right, you're just, it's\nonly gonna happen once. But if you capture it at the\npoint of maximum uncertainty, or maximum surprise, you have the most useful\npoint in your experience that you've grabbed. And what we see is that the hippocampus, and these other networks that are involved in generating these\ninternal models of events, they show a heightened\nperiod of connectivity, or correlated activity,\nduring those breaks between different events,\nwhich we call event boundaries. These are the points where\nyou're like surprised or you cross from one room\nto another, and so forth. And that communication is associated with a bump of activity in the hippocampus and better memory. And so if people have a\nvery good internal model throughout that event you don't need to do much memory processing, you're in a predictive mode, right? And so then at these event\nboundaries you encode and then you retrieve and you're like, \"Okay, wait a minute,\nwhat's going on here? Ranganath's now talking about orcas. What's going on?\" And maybe you have to go back and remember reading my book\nto pull out the episodic memory to make sense of whatever it\nis I'm babbling about, right? And so there's this beautiful dynamics that you can see in the brain\nof these different networks that are coming together\nand then deaffiliating at different points in\ntime that are allowing you to go into these modes. And so to speak to your original\nquestion, to some extent when we're talking about semantic memory, and episodic memory, and working memory, you can think about it as these\nprocesses that are unfolding as these networks kind of\ncome together and pull apart. - Can memory be trained and improved? This beautiful connected\nsystem that you've described, what aspect of it is a mechanism that can be improved through training? - I think improvement, it\ndepends on what your definition of optimal is. So what I say in the book\nis, is that you don't wanna remember more, you wanna remember better, which means focusing on the\nthings that are important. And that's what our\nbrains are designed to do. So if you go back to the\nearliest quantitative studies in memory by Ebbinghaus what\nyou see is that he was trying so hard to memorize\nthis arbitrary nonsense and within a day he lost\nabout 60% of that information. And he was using... He was basically using a\nvery, very generous way of measuring it, right? So as far as we know nobody\nhas managed to violate those basics of having people forget, you know, most of their experiences. So if your expectation is\nthat you should remember everything, and that's\nwhat your optimal is, you're already off because\nthis is not what human brains are designed to do. On the other hand, what\nwe see over and over again is that the brain does... Basically, one of the cool\nthings about the design of the brain is it's always less is more. Less is more, right? It's like, I mean I've seen estimates that the human brain uses\nsomething like 12 to 20 watts, you know, in a day. I mean, that's just nuts, the\nlow power consumption, right? So it's all about reusing information and making the most of\nwhat we already have. And so that's why basically,\nagain, what you see biologically is, you know, neuromodulators for instance, these chemicals in the brain like norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, these are chemicals that are released during moments that tend to\nbe biologically significant: surprise, fear, stress, et cetera. And so these chemicals promote\nlasting plasticity, right? Essentially some mechanisms\nfor which the brain can say prioritize the information\nthat you carry with you into the future. Attention is a big factor as well, our ability to focus our\nattention on what's important. And so there's different schools of thought on training\nattention, for instance. So one of my colleagues, Amishi\nJha, she wrote a book called \"Peak Mind\" and talks about mindfulness as a method for improving\nattention and focus. So she works a lot with military,\nlike Navy SEALs and stuff, to do this kind of work\nwith mindfulness meditation. Adam Gazzaley, another one\nof my friends and colleagues, his work on kind of\ntraining through video games actually as a way of training attention. And so it's not clear to me,\nyou know, one of the challenges though in training is you tend to over fit to the thing that you're\ntrying to optimize, right? So you tend to, if I'm\nlooking at a video game, I can definitely get\nbetter at paying attention in the context of the video game, but do you transfer it\nto the outside world? That's very controversial. - The implication there is\nthat attention is a fundamental component of remembering something, allocating attention to it, and then attention might be\nsomething that you could train. How you allocate attention and how you hold attention on a thing. - I can say that in fact we\ndo in certain ways, right? So if you are an expert in something, you are training attention. So we did this one study\nof expertise in the brain and, you know, so people used to think, let's say if you're a bird\nexpert or something, right? People will go, like if you\nget really into this world of birds, you start to see the differences in your visual cortex is tuned up and it's all about plasticity\nof the visual cortex. And vision researchers love\nto say everything's visual, you know, but... But it's like we did\nthis study of attention and working, or working\nmemory and expertise and one of the things that surprised us were the biggest effects\nas people became experts in identifying these different\nkinds of just crazy objects that we made up, as they\ndeveloped this expertise of being able to identify\nwhat made them different from each other, and\nwhat made them unique, we were actually seeing\nmassive increases in activity in the prefrontal cortex. And this fits with some of\nthe studies of chess experts, and so forth, that it's\nnot so much that you learn the patterns passively,\nyou learn what to look for, you learn what's important\nand what's not, right? And you can see this\nin any kind of expert, professional athlete, they're\nlooking three steps ahead of where they're supposed to be. So that's a kind of a\ntraining of attention. And those are also what you'd\ncall expert memory skills. So if you take the memory athletes, I know that's something\nwe're both interested in. And, you know, so these\nare people who train in these competitions and\nthey'll memorize like a deck of cards in like a really\nshort amount of time. There's a great memory athlete, her name I think is pronounced\nYanjaa Wintersoul, but she... So I think she's got like a\ngiant Instagram following. And so she had this YouTube\nvideo that went viral where she had memorized an\nentire IKEA catalog, right? And so how do people do this? By all accounts from people\nwho become memory athletes, they weren't born with\nsome extraordinary memory, but they practice strategies\nover and over and over again. The strategy that they use for memorizing a particular thing, it\ncan become automatic and you can just deploy\nit in an instant, right? So, again, it's not necessarily gonna... One strategy for learning\nthe order of a deck of cards might not help you for\nsomething else that you need, like, you know, remembering\nyour way around Austin, Texas, but it's gonna be these,\nwhatever you're interested in, you can optimize for that. And that's just a natural\nbyproduct of expertise. - There's certain hacks. There's something called the memory palace that I've played with. I don't know if you're familiar\nwith that whole technique? And it works. It's interesting. So another thing I\nrecommend for people a lot is I use Anki a lot every day. It's a app that does space repetition. So I think medical students, and like students use\nthis a lot to remember a lot of different things. - Oh, yeah. Okay, we can come back\nto this, but yeah, go on. - Sure, it's the whole\nconcept of spaced repetition. You just... When the thing is fresh, you\nkind of have to remind yourself of it a lot, and then over\ntime you can wait a week, a month, a year before you\nhave to recall the thing again. And that way you essentially\nhave something like note cards that you can have tens of\nthousands of and can only spend 30 minutes a day and\nactually be refreshing all of that information,\nall of that knowledge. It's really great. And then for memory palace is a technique that allows you to remember\nthings like the IKEA catalog by placing them visually in a place that you're really familiar with. Like, I'm really familiar\nwith this place so I can put numbers, or facts, or\nwhatever you wanna remember. You can walk along that little palace and it reminds you. It's cool. Like there's stuff like\nthat that I think athletes, memory athletes could use, but I think also regular people can use. One of those things that\nI have to solve for myself is how to remember names. I'm horrible at it. - [Charan] Yeah. - I think it's because when\npeople introduce themselves I have the social anxiety\nof the interaction where I'm like, \"I know I\nshould be remembering that,\" but I'm freaking out internally about social interaction in general and so therefore I forget immediately. So I'm looking for good tricks for that. - So I feel like we've\ngot a lot in common, because when people\nintroduce themselves to me it's almost like I have this\nlike just blank blackout for a moment and then\nI'm just looking at them like, \"What happened?\" And I look away or something. What's wrong with me? - Yeah. - So, I mean, I'm\ntotally with you on this. The reason why it's hard\nis that there's no reason we should be able to remember names, because when you say remembering a name, you're not really remembering a name. Maybe in my case you\nare, but most of the time you're associating a name\nwith a face and an identity. And that's a completely\narbitrary thing, right? I mean, maybe in the olden\ndays somebody named Miller, it's like they're actually making flour or something like that. But, you know, for the most\npart it's like these names are just utterly arbitrary, so you have no thing to latch onto. And so it's not really a thing that our brain does very well is to learn meaningless, arbitrary stuff. So what you need to do is\nbuild connection somehow. Visualize a connection. And sometimes it's obvious,\nor sometimes it's not. I'm trying to think of\na good one for you now, but the first thing I\nthink of is Lex Luthor. But-\n- That's great. - Yeah.\n- 'Cause doesn't Lex Luthor wear a suit, I think? - I know he has a shaved head though. - Yeah.\n- Or he's bald, which you're not. You've got a great head of... I'd trade hair with you any day, but- - Right. - But like, you know, something like that. But if I can come up with something. Like, I could say, \"Okay, so Lex Luthor is this criminal mastermind.\" Then I just imagine you- - We talked about stabbing\nor whatever earlier- - Yeah, yeah, exactly. - So just gotta connect it and that's it. - Yeah, yeah. And I... But I'm serious though that these kinds of weird associations, now I'm building a richer network. I mean, one of the things\nthat I find is if I've... Like you can have somebody's name that's just totally generic,\nlike John Smith or something. Not that... No offense to people with that name. But, you know, if I see a generic name like that, but I've read John\nSmith's papers academically and then I meet John\nSmith at a conference, I can immediately associate\nthat name with that face, 'cause I have this preexisting network to lock everything into, right? And so you can build that network, and that's what the method of loci, or the memory palace\ntechnique is all about, is you have a preexisting\nstructure in your head of like your childhood home, or this mental palace that\nyou've created for yourself, and so now you can put arbitrary pieces of information in different locations in that mental structure of yours, and then you could walk\nthrough the different path and find all the pieces of\ninformation you're looking for. So the method of loci is a great method for just learning arbitrary things because it allows you\nto link them together and get that cue that you need to pop in and find everything, right? - We should maybe linger\non this memory palace thing just to make obvious. 'Cause when people were\ndescribing to me a while ago what this is, it seems insane. I just, you literally think of a place like a childhood home, or a home that you're\nreally visually familiar with, and you literally place in that three dimensional\nspace facts, or people, or whatever you wanna remember. And you just walk in your mind\nalong that place visually, and you can remember, remind yourself of the different things. One of the limitations is\nthere is a sequence to it. So I think your brain somehow, you need, you can't just like go upstairs\nright away or something, you have to like walk along the room. So it's really great for\nremembering sequences, but it's also not great for remembering like individual\nfacts out of context. So the full context of the\ntour I think is important. But it's fascinating how the mind is able to do that when you ground these pieces of knowledge into something that you remember well\nalready, especially visually. Fascinating. And you could just do that\nfor any kind of sequence. And I'm sure she used something like this for the, for IKEA catalog,\nsomething of this nature. - Oh, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And I think the principle here\nis, again, I was telling you this idea that memories can\ncompete with each other, right? Well, I like to use this example, and maybe someday I'll regret this, but I've used it a lot recently, is like imagine if this were\nmy desk it could be cluttered with a zillion different things, right? So imagine it's just\ncluttered with a whole bunch of yellow post-it notes and on one of them I put my\nbank password on it, right? Well it's gonna take\nme forever to find it. I might, you know, it's\njust gonna be buried under all these other post-it notes. But if it's like hot\npink it's gonna stand out and I find it really easily, right? So that's one way in which\nif things are distinctive, if you've processed information\nin a very distinctive way, then you can have a\nmemory that's gonna last. And that's very good, for instance, for name-face association. So if I get something\ndistinctive about you, you know that it's like that\nyou've got very short hair and maybe I can make the\nassociation with Lex Luthor that way, or something like that, right? You know? But I get something very specific. That's a great cue. But the other part of it\nis, what if I just organized my notes so that I have\nmy finances in one pile and I have my like reminders, my to-do list in one pile, and so forth. And so I organize them. Well then I know exactly if\nI'm going for my banking, you know, my bank password, I could go to the finance pile, right? So the method of loci works,\nor memory palaces work because they give you a way of organizing. There's a school of thought\nthat says that episodic memory evolved from this like kind of knowledge of space and, you know, basically\nthis primitive abilities to figure out where you are, and so people explain the\nmethod of loci that way. And, you know, whether or\nnot the evolutionary argument is true, the method of\nloci is not at all special. So if you don't, you're\nnot a good visualizer, stories are a good one. So a lot of memory\nathletes will use stories and they'll go... Like if you're memorizing a deck of cards, they have a little code for the different, like the king and the jack\nand the 10 and so forth. And they'll make up a story about things that they're doing, and that'll work. Songs are a great one, right? I mean, it's like, I can still\nremember there's this obscure episode of the TV show, \"Cheers.\" They sing a song about Albania\nthat he uses to memorize all these facts about Albania, and I could still sing that song to you. It's... It is just, I saw it\non a TV show, you know. - So you mentioned spaced repetition, so do you like this process? Maybe can you explain it? - Oh, yeah. If I am trying to memorize something, let's say if I have an hour to memorize as many Spanish words as I can, if I just try to do like half an hour and then later in the\nday I do half an hour, I won't retain that information as long as if I do half an hour today and half an hour one week from now. And so doing that extra\nspacing should help me retain the information better. Now there's a interesting\nboundary condition which is, it depends on when\nyou need that information. So many of us, you know, for\nme, like I can't remember so much from college and\nhigh school 'cause I crammed, 'cause I just did everything\nat the last minute. And sometimes I would literally study like, you know, in the\nhallway right before the test. And that was great\nbecause what would happen is, is I just had that\ninformation right there. And so actually not\nspacing can really help you if you need it very quickly, right? But the problem is, is that\nyou tend to forget it later on. But on the other hand,\nif you space things out, you get a benefit for later on retention. And so there's many\ndifferent explanations. We have a computational model of this, it's currently under revision. But in our computer model, what\nwe say is, is that an easy, maybe a good way of thinking\nabout this is this conversation that you and I are having, it's associated with a particular context,\na particular place in time. And so all these little cues\nthat are in the background, these little guitar\nsculptures that you have, and that big light umbrella thing, right? All these things are part of my memory for what we're talking about, the content. So now later on you're sitting around and you're at home drinking a beer and you're thinking, \"God, what a strange interview that was.\" Right? So now you're trying to remember it, but the context is different. So your current situation doesn't match up with the memory that you pulled up. There's error. There's a mismatch between\nwhat you've pulled up and your current context. And so in our model, what\nyou start to do is you start to erase or alter the parts of the memory that are associated with\na specific place and time, and you heighten the\ninformation about the content. And so if you remember this\ninformation in different times, in different places, it's more accessible at different times in different places, because it's not overfitted, in a AI kind of way of\nthinking about things, not overfitted to one particular context. But that's also why the memories\nthat we call upon the most also feel kind of like they're just things that we read about almost, you don't vividly reimagine them, right? It's like they're just these\nthings that just come to us, like facts, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - And it's a little bit\ndifferent than semantic memory, but it's like basically these\nevents that we have recalled every, you know, over\nand over and over again, we keep updating that memory\nso it's less and less tied to the original experience. But then we have those other ones, which it's like you just get a reminder of that very specific context. You smell something, you\nhear a song, you see a place that you haven't been to in a while and boom, it just comes back to you. And that's the exact opposite\nof what you get with spacing. Right? - That's so fascinating. So with spaced repetition,\none of its powers is that you lose attachment\nto a particular context, but then it loses the intensity\nof the flavor of the memory. - Mm-hmm.\n- That's interesting. That's so interesting. - Yeah. But, you know, at the same\ntime it becomes stronger in the sense that the\ncontent becomes stronger. - Yeah, so it's used\nfor learning languages, for learning facts, for learning, for... But, you know, for that generic semantic information type of memories. - Yeah. And I think this falls into a category, we've done other modeling, one of these is a published study in \"PLOS Computational Biology,\" where we show that another\nway, which is I think related to the spacing effect, is what's\ncalled the testing effect. So the idea is, is that if\nyou're trying to learn words, let's say in Spanish,\nor something like that, and this doesn't have to be\nwords, it could be anything, you test yourself on the words and that act of testing yourself\nhelps you retain it better over time than if you just studied it. Right? And so from traditional learning theories, some learning theories,\nanyway, this seems weird, why would you do better, giving\nyourself this extra error from testing yourself\nrather than just, you know, giving yourself perfect input that's a replica of what it is\nthat you're trying to learn? And I think the reason is, is\nthat you get better retention from that error, that mismatch\nthat we talked about, right? So what's happening in our model, it's actually conceptually\nkind of similar to what happens with back prop in AI, or neural networks. And so the idea is, is that you expose, \"Here's the bad connections, and here's the good connections.\" And so we can keep the\nparts of the cell assembly that are good for the memory and lose the ones that are not so good. But if you don't stress test the memory, you haven't exposed it to the error fully. And so that's why I think this\nis kind of, this is a thing that I come back to over and over again, is that you will retain information better if you're constantly pushing\nyourself to your limit, right? If you are feeling like you're coasting, then you're actually not learning. So if it's like- - Always, so you should\nalways be stress testing the memory system? - Yeah, and feel good about it. You know, even though everyone tells me, \"Oh, my memory's terrible.\" In the moment they're overconfident about what they'll retain later on. So it's fascinating. And so what happens is,\nis when you test yourself, you're like, \"Oh my God,\nI thought I knew that, but I don't.\" And so it can be demoralizing until you get around that and you realize, \"Hey, this is the way that I learn. This is how I learn best.\" It's like if you're trying\nto, you know, star in a movie or something like that, you\ndon't just sit around reading the script, you actually act it out and you're gonna botch those\nlines from time to time. Right? - You know, there's an interesting moment. You probably have experienced this. I remember a good friend\nof mine, Joe Rogan, I was on his podcast and\nwe were randomly talking about soccer, football. Somebody I grew up watching,\nDiego Armando Maradona, one of the greatest soccer\nplayers of all time. And we were talking about\nhim and his career and so on. And Joe asked me if he's still around. Now... And I said, \"Yeah.\" I don't know why I thought, \"Yeah.\" Because that was a perfect\nexample of memories. He passed away. I tweeted about it, how heartbroken I was, all this kind of stuff,\nlike a year before. I know this but in my mind I went back to the thing I've done\nmany times in my head, visualizing some of the epic\nruns he had on goal, and so on. So for me, he's alive. And so I'm... In part of also the\nconversation when you're talking to Joey there's stress and like... The focus is allocated,\nthe attention is allocated in a particular way. But when I walked away I was like, \"In which world was Diego\nMaradona still alive?\" Like in which... 'Cause I was sure- - Yeah.\n- In my head that he was still alive. And it was a... It's a moment that sticks with me. I've had a few like that in my life where it just kinda... Like obvious things just\ndisappear from mind. And it's cool. Like it shows actually\nthe power of the mind, in a positive sense, to erase memories you want erased maybe. But I don't know. I don't know if there's a\ngood explanation for that. - One of the cool things that I found is that some people really\njust revolutionize a field by creating a problem\nthat didn't exist before. It's kinda like why I love science, it's like engineering is like solving other people's problems, and science is about creating problems. And I'm just much more\nlike I want to break things and, you know, create problems. - [Lex] Yeah. - Not necessarily move fast though. But one of my former\nmentors, Marcia Johnson, who in my opinion is one of\nthe greatest memory researchers of all time, she comes up,\nyoung woman in the field, and it's mostly guy field, and she gets into this idea of\nhow do we tell the difference between things that we've imagined and things that we actually remember. How do we tell... I get some mental experience, where did that mental\nexperience come from? Right? And it turns out this is a huge problem because essentially our mental experience of remembering something that happened, our mental experience of\nthinking about something, how do you tell the difference? They're both largely\nconstructions in our head. And so it is very important. And the way that you do it is... I mean, it's not perfect,\nbut the way that we often do it and succeed is by, again,\nusing our prefrontal cortex and really focusing on\nthe sensory information or the place and time and\nthe things that put us back into when this information happened. And if it's something you thought about you're not gonna have\nall of that vivid detail as you do for something\nthat actually happened. But it doesn't work all the time. But that's a big thing\nthat you have to do. But it takes time. It's slow and it's, again, effortful. But that's what you need\nto remember accurately. But what's cool, and I think\nthis is what you alluded to about how that was an\ninteresting experience, is imagination's exactly the opposite. Imagination is basically saying, \"I'm just gonna take all\nthis information from memory, recombine it in different\nways and throw it out there.\" And so for instance, Dan\nSchacter and Donna Addis have done cool work on this. Demis Hassabis did work on this with Eleanor Maguire and UCL. And this goes back actually\nto this guy Frederic Bartlett who is this revolutionary\nmemory researcher. Bartlett, he actually like\nrejected the whole idea of quantifying memory. He said, there's no statistics in my book. He came from this\nanthropology perspective. And, short version of the\nstory is, he just asked people to recall things. You give people stories and\npoem, ask people to recall them. And what he found was people's\nmemories didn't reflect all of the details of\nwhat they were exposed to. And they did reflect a lot more, they were filtered through\nthis lens of prior knowledge, the cultures that they came\nfrom, the beliefs that they had, the things they knew. And so what he concluded was\nthat he called remembering an imaginative construction, meaning that we don't replay the past, we imagine how the past could have been by taking bits and pieces\nthat come up in our heads. And, likewise, he wrote this\nbeautiful paper on imagination saying, when we imagine\nsomething, and create something, we're creating it from\nthese specific experiences that we've had and combining\nit with our general knowledge. But instead of trying to\nfocus it on being accurate and getting out one thing you're\njust ruthlessly recombining things without any,\nyou know, any necessary kind of goal in mind. I mean, or at least that's\none kind of creation. - So imagination is\nfundamentally coupled with memory in both directions? - I think so. I mean, it's not clear\nthat it is in everyone, but one of the things that's\nbeen studied is some patients who have amnesia, for instance,\nthey have brain damage say to the hippocampus and\nif you ask them to imagine things that are not in front of them, like imagine what could happen\nafter I leave this room. Right? They find it very difficult\nto give you a scenario what could happen. Or if they do it would\nbe more stereotype like, \"Yes, this would happen, this would...\" But it's not like they can come up with anything that's very vivid\nand creative in that sense. And it's partly 'cause\nwhen you have amnesia, you're stuck in the present. Because to get a very\ngood model of the future it really helps to have\nepisodic memories to draw upon. Right? And so that's the basic idea. And in fact one of the most\nimpressive things when people started to scan people's brains and ask people to remember past events, what they found was there\nwas this big network of the brain called the\ndefault mode network. It gets a lot of press because it's like thought to be important, it's engaged during mind wandering. And if I ask you to pay\nattention to something, it only comes on when you\nstop paying attention. You know, so people, \"Oh, it's just this kind of,\nyou know, daydreaming network.\" And I thought, this is\njust ridiculous research. Who cares? You know? But then what people found\nwas when people recall episodic memories, this\nnetwork gets active. And so we started to look\ninto it and this network of areas is really closely\nfunctionally interacting with the hippocampus. And so... In fact, some would say the hippocampus is part of this default network. And if you look at brain images of people, or brain maps of activation, so to speak, of people imagining possible scenarios of things that could happen in the future, or even things that couldn't\nreally be very plausible, they look very similar. I mean, you know, to the naked\neye they look almost the same as maps of brain activation\nwhen people remember the past. According to our theory,\nand we've got some data to support this, we've\nbroken up this network in various sub pieces, is that basically it's\nkind of taking apart all of our experiences and\ncreating these little Lego blocks out of them, and then you\ncan put them back together if you have the right\ninstructions to recreate these experiences that you've had, but you could also reassemble\nthem into new pieces to create a model of an event\nthat hasn't happened yet. And that's what we think happens. And when I'm... Our common ground that we're\nestablishing in language requires using those building blocks to put together a model\nof what's going on. - Well there's a good percentage of time I personally live in the imagined world. I think of... I have... I do thought experiments a lot. I, you know, take the\nabsurdity of human life as it stands and play it forward in all kinds of different directions. Sometimes it's rigorous\nthought experiments, sometimes it's fun ones. So I imagine that that has an effect on how I remember things. And I suppose I have to\nbe a little bit careful to make sure stuff happened versus stuff that I\njust imagined happened. And this also, I mean,\nsome of my best friends are characters inside books\nthat never even existed. And I'm, you know, there's some degree to which they actually exist in my mind. Like these characters\nexist, authors exist, Dostoevsky exists, but\nalso \"Brothers Karamazov.\" - I love that book. - Yeah.\n- It's one of the few books I've read. (both laughing) One of the few literature\nbooks that I've read, I should say. I read a lot in school\nthat I don't remember, but \"Brothers Karamazov\" was good. - But they exist. - They exist, and I have almost kind of like conversations with them. It's interesting. It's interesting to allow your brain to kind of play with ideas of the past, of the imagined, and see it all as one. - Yeah, there was actually\nthis famous mnemonist, he is kind of like back\nthen the equivalent of a memory athlete, except he would go to shows and do this. That was described by this\nreally famous neuropsychologist from Russia named Luria. And so this guy was named\nSolomon Shereshevsky and he had this condition\ncalled synesthesia that basically created\nthese weird associations between different senses that\nnormally wouldn't go together. So that gave him this\nincredibly vivid imagination that he would use to basically imagine all sorts of things that\nhe would need to memorize. And he would just\nimagine, like just create these incredibly detailed\nthings in his head that allowed him to\nmemorize all sorts of stuff. But it also really haunted\nhim, by some reports, that basically it was\nlike he was at some point, you know, and again who knows\nthe drinking was part of this, but at some point had\ntrouble differentiating his imagination from reality. Right? And this is interesting\nbecause it's like... I mean that's what\npsychosis is in some ways, is you, you know, first of\nall you're just learning connections from prediction errors that you probably shouldn't learn. And the other part of it is,\nis that your internal signals are being confused with actual\nthings in the outside world. Right? - Well that's why a lot of this stuff is both feature and bug. It's a double-edged sword. - Yeah, I mean it might be why\nthere's such an interesting relationship between genius and psychosis. - Yeah, maybe they're just\ntwo sides of the same coin. Humans are fascinating, aren't they? - I think so. Sometimes scary, but mostly fascinating. - Can we just talk about\nmemory sport a little longer? There's something called\nthe USA Memory Championship. - [Charan] Mm. - Like what are these athletes... Like what does it mean to\nbe like elite level at this? Have you interacted with any of them? Or reading about them\nwhat have you learned about these folks? - There's a guy named Henry Roediger who's studying these guys. And there's actually a book by Joshua Foer called\n\"Moonwalking with Einstein,\" where he talks about... He actually, as part of\nthis book, just decided to become a memory athlete. They often have these life events that make them go, \"Hey,\nwhy don't I do this?\" So there was a guy named Scott\nHagwood, who I write about, who thought that he was... He was getting chemo for\ncancer and so he decided like, because the chemo,\nthere's a well-known thing called chemo brain where people\nbecome like, they just lose a lot of their sharpness. And so he wanted to fight that by learning these memory skills. So he bought a book, and\nthis is the story you hear in a lot of memory\nathletes is they buy a book by other memory athletes. - Yeah.\n- Or other memory experts, so to speak, and they\njust learn those skills and practice them over and over again. They start by winning bets and so forth, and then they go into these competitions. And the competitions are\ntypically things like memorizing long strings of numbers, or\nmemorizing, you know, orders of cards and so forth. So there tend to be pretty\narbitrary things, not like things that would be able, you'd be able to bring a lot of prior knowledge. But they build the skills that you need to memorize arbitrary things. - Yeah, that's fascinating. I've gotten a chance to work with something called N-Back tasks. So there's all these kinds of tasks- - [Charan] Oh, yeah. - Memory recall tasks that are used to kinda load up the quote\nunquote working memory. - [Charan] Yeah, yeah. - And to see a psychologist\nused it to test all kinds of stuff, like to see how well you're good at multitasking. We used it in particular\nfor the task of driving. Like if we fill up your brain\nwith intensive working memory tasks, how good are you\nat also not crashing? That kind of stuff. So it's fascinating. But, again, those tasks are arbitrary and they're usually about\nrecalling a sequence of numbers in some kind\nof semi complex way. Are you, do you have any favorite tasks of this nature in your own studies? - I've really been most excited about going in the opposite direction and using things that are\nmore and more naturalistic. - [Lex] Mm. - And the reason is is\nthat we've really moved in that direction because what we found is, is that memory works\nvery, very differently when you study it, when\nyou study memory in the way that people typically remember. And so it goes into a\nmuch more predictive mode and you have these event\nboundaries, for instance, and you have... But a lot of what happens is\nthis kind of fascinating mix that we've been talking about, a mix of interpretations and\nimagination with perception. And so... And the new direction we're\ngoing in is understanding navigation in our memory for places. And the reason is, is\nthat there's a lot of work that's done in rats,\nwhich is very good work. They have a rat and they put it in a box and the rat goes, chases cheese in a box and you'll find cells in the hippocampus that fire when a rat is in\ndifferent places in the box. And so the conventional wisdom\nis that the hippocampus forms this map of the box. And I think that probably may happen when you have like absolutely\nno knowledge of the world. Right? But I think one of the cool\nthings about human memory is we can bring to bear\nour past experiences to economically learn new ones. And so, for instance, if\nyou learn a map of an IKEA, let's say if I go to the IKEA in Austin, I'm sure there's one here, I\nprobably could go to this IKEA and find my way to the, you\nknow, where the wine glasses are without having to even think about it because it's got a very similar layout. Even though IKEA's a\nnightmare to get around once I learned my local IKEA,\nI can use that map everywhere. Why form a brand new one for a new place? And so that kind of ability\nto reuse information really comes into play when we look at things that are, you know,\nmore naturalistic tasks. And another thing that\nwe're really interested in is this idea of like what if instead of basically mapping out\nevery coordinate in a space you form a pretty economical graph that connects basically the\nmajor landmarks together and being able to use that\nas, you know, emphasizing the things that are most important, the places that you go for food, and the places that are landmarks\nthat help you get around, and then filling in the\nblanks for the rest. Because I really believe\nthat cognitive maps, or mental maps, of the world, just like our memories for events, are not photographic. I think they're this combination of actual verifiable details and then a lot of inference that you make. - So what have you learned about this kind of\nspatial mapping of places? How do people represent locations? - There's a lot of variability. I think that... And there's a lot of disagreement about how people represent locations. In a world of GPS and\nphysical maps people can learn it from like basically what\nthey call a survey perspective, being able to see everything. And so that's one way in\nwhich humans can do it that's a little bit different. There's one way which\nwe can memorize routes. Like I know how to get from here to... Let's say if I knew... Walk here from my hotel, I\ncould just rigidly follow that route back, right? And there's another more integrative way which would be what's\ncalled a cognitive map, which would be kind of a sense\nof how everything relates to each other. And so there's lots of people\nwho believe that these maps that we have in our head are\nisomorphic with the world that are like these literal coordinates that follow Euclidean space. And as you know, Euclidean\nmathematics is very constrained. Right? And I think that we are\nactually much more generative in our maps of space so that we do have these bits and pieces. And we've got a small task as... It's right now, not yet... Like we need to do some work\non it for further analyses but one of the things we're looking at is these signals called\nripples in the hippocampus, which are these bursts\nof activity that you see that are synchronized with\nareas in the neocortex, in the default network actually. And so what we find is,\nis that those ripples seem to increase at\nnavigationally important points when you're making a decision,\nor when you reach a goal. This speaks to the emotion thing, right? Because if you have limited choices, if I'm walking down a street I could really just get a\nmental map of the neighborhood with a more minimal kind\nof thing by just saying, \"Here's the intersections and\nhere's the directions I take to get in between them.\" And what we found in\ngeneral in our MRI studies is basically the more people\ncan reduce the problem, whether it's space, or any kind\nof decision making problem, the less the hippocampus encodes. It really is very economical\ntowards the points of most highest information\ncontent and value. - So can you describe the\nencoding, and the hippocampus, and the ripples you were talking about? What's the signal in\nwhich we see the ripples? - Yeah, so this is really interesting. There are these oscillations, right? So there's these waves\nthat you basically see and these waves are points\nof very high excitability and low excitability. And, at least during... They happen actually\nduring slow wave sleep too. So the deepest stages of sleep\nwhen you're just zonked out. Right? You see these very slow waves\nwhere it's like very excitable and then very unexcitable. It goes up and down. And on top of them you'll see these little sharp wave ripples. And when there's a\nripple in the hippocampus you tend to see a sequence\nof cells that resemble a sequence of cells that\nfire when, you know, an animal's actually doing\nsomething in the world. So it almost is like a little... People call it replay. I think it's a little bit,\nI don't like that term, but it's basically a little\nbit of a compressed play of the sequence of activity in the brain that was taking place earlier. And during those moments\nthere's a little window of communication between the hippocampus and these areas in the neocortex. And so that, I think, helps\nyou form new memories, but it also helps you,\nI think, stabilize them but also really connect different\nthings together in memory and allows you to build bridges\nbetween different events that you've had. And so this is one of\nour theories of sleep and its real role in helping\nyou see the connections between different events\nthat you've experienced. - Oh, so during sleep is when\nthe connections are formed? - The connections\nbetween different events. - Yeah.\n- Right? So it's like you see me\nnow, you see me next week, you see me a month\nlater, you start to build a little internal model of how I behave and, you know, what to expect of me. And we think sleep, one of\nthe things it allows you to do is figure out those connections,\nand connect the dots, and find the signal in the noise. - So you mentioned FMRI, what is it and how is it used in studying memory? - This is actually the reason why I got into this whole field of science is when I was in grad school FMRI was just really taking off as a technique for studying brain activity. And what's beautiful\nabout it is you can study the whole human brain and,\nthere's lots of limits to it, but you can basically do it in a person without sticking anything\ninto their brains. And very non-invasive. I mean for me being in an MRI scanner is like being in the\nwomb, I just fall asleep. If I'm not being asked to do\nanything I get very sleepy. You know? But you can have people watch movies while they're being scanned, or you can have them do tests of memory, like giving them words\nand so forth to memorize. But what MRI is itself\nis just this technique where you put people in a\nvery high magnetic field. Typical ones we would\nuse would be 3 Tesla, to give you an idea. So a 3 Tesla magnet, you put\nsomebody in and what happens is you get this very weak but, you know, measurable\nmagnetization in the brain and then you apply a\nradio frequency pulse, which is basically a different\nelectromagnetic field. And so you're basically using water, the water molecules in the\nbrain, as a tracer, so to speak. And part of it in FMRI is the fact that these magnetic fields that you mess with by manipulating these\nradio frequency pulses, and the static field, and you\nhave things called gradients which change the strength\nof the magnetic field in different parts of the head. So they're all... We tweak them in different ways, but the basic idea that we use an FMRI is that blood is flowing to the brain and when you have blood\nthat doesn't have oxygen on it, it's a little bit more magnetizable than blood that does. 'Cause you have hemoglobin\nthat carries the oxygen, the iron, basically, in the\nblood that makes it red. And so that hemoglobin,\nwhen it's deoxygenated, actually has different\nmagnetic field properties than when it has oxygen. And it turns out when you have\nan increase in local activity in some part of the brain\nthe blood flows there and as a result you get\na lower concentration of hemoglobin that is not oxygenated and then that gives you more signal. So I gave you a... I think I sent you a\nGIF, as you like to say. - Yeah, we had off record intense argument about if it's pronounced\nGIF or GIF, but that's... We shall set that aside as friends. - We could have called it a\nstern rebuke perhaps, but... - Rebuke, yeah. I drew a hard line. It is true the creator of\nGIF said it's pronounced GIF, but that's the only person\nthat pronounces it GIF. Anyway, yes, you sent a GIF of... - This would be basically a\nwhole a movie of FMRI data. And so when you look at it,\nit's not very impressive, it looks like these like very\npixelated maps of the brain, but it's mostly kinda like white. But these tiny changes in the\nintensity of those signals, that you probably wouldn't\nbe able to visually perceive, like about 1% can be statistically very, very large effects for us. And that allows us to see,\n\"Hey, there's an increase in activity in some part of the brain when I'm doing some task, like trying to remember something.\" And I can use those\nchanges to even predict, \"Is a person going to\nremember this later or not?\" And the coolest thing that\npeople have done is to decode what people are remembering\nfrom the patterns of activity from, 'cause\nmaybe when I'm remembering this thing, like I'm remembering\nthe house where I grew up, I might have one pixel that's\nbright in the hippocampus and one that's dark, and if I'm remembering, you\nknow, something more like the car that I used to\ndrive when I was 16, I might see the opposite pattern, where a different pixel's bright. And so all that little stuff\nthat we used to think of noise, we can now think of almost like a QR code for memory, so to speak. Where different memories have\na different little pattern of bright pixels and dark pixels. And so this really\nrevolutionized my research. So there's fancy research out\nthere where people really... I mean not even that, I\nmean by your standards this would be stone age, but, you know, applying\nmachine learning techniques to do decoding and so forth. And now there's a lot of\nforward encoding models and you can go to town\nwith this stuff, right? And I'm much more old school,\nof designing experiments where you basically say,\n\"Okay, here's a whole web of memories that overlap\nin some way, shape or form. Do memories that occurred\nin the same place, have a similar QR code? And do memories that\noccurred in different places have a different QR code?\" And you can just use things\nlike correlation coefficients or cosign distance to\nmeasure that stuff, right? Super simple, right? And so what happens is\nyou can start to get a whole state space of how a brain area is indexing all these different memories. It's super fascinating because what we could see is\nthis little like separation between how certain brain\nareas are processing memory for who was there, and other brain areas of processing information\nabout where it occurred, or the situation that's kind of unfolding. And some are giving you\ninformation about what are my goals that are involved and so forth. And so... And the hippocampus is just\nputting it all together into these unique things\nthat just are about when and where it happened. - So there's a separation\nbetween spatial information concepts, like literally there's distinct, as you said, QR codes for these? - So to speak. Let me try a different analogy too, that might be more accessible for people, which would be like, you've got a folder on your computer, right? I open it up, there's\na bunch of files there. I can sort those files by,\nyou know, alphabetical order. And now things that\nboth start with letter A are lumped together, and things that start with Z\nversus A are far apart, right? And so that is one way\nof organizing the folder. But I could do it by date, and if I do it by date\nthings that were created close together in time are close and things that are far\napart in time are far. So every... Like you can think of how a brain area, or a network of areas,\ncontributes to memory by looking at what the sorting scheme is. And these QR codes that\nwe're talking about, that you get from FMRI,\nallow you to do that. And you can do the same\nthing if you're recording from massive populations\nof neurons in an animal and you can do it for\nrecording local potentials in the brain. You know, so little waves\nof activity in, let's say, a human who has epilepsy and they stick electrodes in their brain, try to find the seizures. So that's some of the\nwork that we're doing now. But all these techniques\nbasically allow you to say, \"Hey, what's the sorting scheme?\" And so we've found that\nsome networks of the brain sort information in memory\naccording to who was there. So I might have... Like we've actually shown in\none of my favorite studies of all time that was done by\na former postdoc, Zach Raya, and Zach did the study\nwhere we had a bunch of movies with different people in my labs that are two different people, and you filmed them at two different cafes and two different supermarkets. And what you could show is\nin one particular network you could find the same\nkind of pattern of activity, more or less, a very, very\nsimilar pattern of activity, every time I saw Alex\nin one of these movies, no matter where he was, right? And I could see another one\nthat was like a common pattern that happened every time I saw this particular supermarket\nnugget, you know? And so... And it didn't matter whether\nyou're watching a movie or whether you're recalling the movie, it was the same kind of\npattern that comes up, right? - That's so fascinating.\n- It was fascinating. And so now you have those building blocks for assembling a model of\nwhat's happening in the present, imagining what could happen and remembering things very economically from putting together all these pieces so that all the hippocampus has to do is get the right kind of blueprint for how to put together\nall these building blocks. - These are all like beautiful\nhints at a super interesting system that makes me\nwonder on the other side of it how to build it. But it's like, it's fascinating. Like the way it does the encoding is really, really fascinating. Or I guess the symptoms,\nthe results of that encoding are fascinating to study from this. Just as a small tangent, you mentioned sort of the measuring local potentials with electrodes versus FMRI. - [Charan] Oh, yeah. - What are some interesting\nlike limitations, possibilities of FMRI? Maybe... The way you explain it is like brilliant, with blood and detecting the activations, or the excitation, because\nblood flows to that area. What's like the latency of that? Like what's the blood\ndynamics in the brain that... - [Charan] Yeah, yeah. - Like how quickly can it... How quickly can the tasks change\nand all that kind of stuff? - Yeah, I mean it's very slow. To the brain 50 milliseconds\nis like, you know, like it's an eternity. Like maybe not 50, but, you\nknow, maybe like, you know, let's say half a second, 500 milliseconds, just so much back and forth\nstuff happens in the brain in that time, right? So in FMRI you can measure\nthese magnetic field responses about six seconds after\nthat burst of activity would take place. All these things, it's like,\nis it a feature or is it a bug? Right? So one of the interesting\nthings that's been discovered about FMRI is it's not so\ntightly related to the spiking of the neurons. So we tend to think of the\ncomputation, so to speak, as being driven by spikes. Meaning like there's just a burst of, it's either on or it's off, and the neurons like going up or down. But sometimes what you\ncan have is these states where the neuron becomes a\nlittle bit more excitable or less excitable. And so FMRI is very sensitive to those changes in excitability. Actually one of the\nfascinating things about FMRI is where does that... How is it we go from neural activity to, you know, essentially\nblood flow to oxygen? You know, all this stuff. It's such a long chain of, you know, going from neural activity to magnetic fields. And one of the theories that's out there is, you know, most of\nthe cells in the brain are not neurons, they're\nactually these support cells called glial cells, and\none big one is astrocytes, and they play this big role in regulating, you know, kind of being a\nmiddle man, so to speak, with the neurons. So if you, for instance,\nlike one neuron's talking to another, you release a neurotransmitter like let's say glutamate, and that gets another\nneuron starts getting active after you release in the gap between the two neurons\ncalled the synapse. So what's interesting is if\nyou leave that, you know, imagine you're just flooded\nwith this like liquid in there, right? If you leave it in there too long you just excite the other neuron too much and you can start to basically\nget seizure activity. You don't want this. So you gotta suck it up. And so actually what\nhappens is these astrocytes, one of their functions is\nto suck up the glutamate from the synapse and\nthat is a massively... And then break it down,\nand then feed it back into the neurons so that you can reuse it. But that cycling is actually\nvery energy intensive. And what's interesting is, at\nleast according to one theory, they need to work so\nquickly that they're working on metabolizing the glucose that comes in without using oxygen. Kind of like anaerobic metabolism. So they're not using oxygen as fast as they are using glucose. So what we're really seeing\nin some ways maybe, in FMRI, not the neurons themselves being active but rather the astrocytes\nwhich are meeting the metabolic demands of the process of\nkeeping the whole system going. - It does seem to be\nthat FMRI is a good way to study activation. So with these astrocytes,\neven though there's a latency, it's pretty reliably\ncoupled to the activations. - Oh, well this gets me to\nthe other part about my- - [Lex] Yeah. - So now let's say for instance, if I'm just kind of\nlike I'm talking to you, but I'm kind of paying attention\nto your cowboy hat, right? So I'm looking off to the... Or I'm thinking about the right, even if I'm not looking at it. What you'd see is, is that there would be this little elevation in activity in areas in the visual cortex, you know, which process vision,\naround that point in space. Okay? So if then something happened, like, you know, a sudden a light flashed in that part of, you know, right in front of your cowboy hat, I would\nhave a bigger response to it. But what you see in\nFMRI is even if I'm not, even if I don't see that flash of light, there's a lot of activity\nthat I can measure because you're kind of\nkeeping it excitable. And that in and of itself,\neven though I'm not seeing anything there that's\nparticularly interesting there's still this increase in activity. And so it's more sensitive with FMRI. So there... Is that a feature or is it a bug? You know, some people, people\nwho study spikes in neurons would say, \"Well that's\nterrible, we don't want that.\" You know, likewise it's\nslow, and that's terrible for measuring things that are very fast. But one of the things\nthat we found in our work was when we give people movies and when we give people\nstories to listen to a lot of the action is in\nthe very, very slow stuff. Because if you're thinking\nabout like a story, let's say you're listening\nto a podcast or something, you're listening to the \"Lex\nFridman Podcast,\" right? You're putting this stuff together and building this internal\nmodel over several seconds, which is basically we\nfilter that out when we look at electrical activity in the brain, because we're interested\nin this millisecond scale. It's almost massive amounts\nof information, right? So the way I see it is every technique gives you a little limited\nwindow into what's going on. FMRI has huge problems. You know, people lie down in the scanner, there's parts of the brain where you... I'll show you in some of\nthese images where you'll see kind of gaping holes because there's... You can't keep the magnetic\nfield stable in those spots. You'll see parts where\nit's like there's a vein and so it just produces big increases and decreases in signal. Or respiration that causes these changes. There's lots of artifacts\nand stuff like that. You know, every technique has its limits. If I'm lying down in an MRI\nscanner, I'm lying down, I'm not interacting\nwith you in the same way that I would in the real world. But at the same time I'm getting data that I might not be able to get otherwise. And so different techniques give you different kinds of advantages. - What kind of big scientific\ndiscoveries, maybe the flavor of discoveries, have been\ndone throughout the history of the science of memory,\nthe studying of memory? What kind of things have\nbeen like understood? - Oh, there's so many. It's really so hard to summarize it. I mean I think it's funny because it's like when you're in the field you can get kind of\nblase about this stuff. But then once I started to\nwrite the book I was like, \"Oh my God, this is really interesting. How did we do all this stuff?\" I would say that some of the... I mean, you know, from the\nfirst studies just showing how much we forget is very important. Showing how much schemas, which\nis our organized knowledge about the world, increase our ability to remember information. Just massively increases it. Our studies of expertise,\nshowing how experts like chess experts can memorize so much in such a short amount of time because of the schemas\nthey have for chess. But then also showing that those lead to all sorts of distortions in memory. The discovery that the act of remembering can change the memory,\nit can strengthen it, but it can also distort it\nif you get misinformation at the time. And it can also strengthen\nor weaken other memories that you didn't even recall. So just this whole idea of\nmemory as an ecosystem, I think, was a big discovery. I could go on. This idea of like breaking\nup our continuous experience into these discreet events, I\nthink was a major discovery. - So the discreetness of\nour encoding of events? - Maybe, yeah. I mean, you know, and again,\nthere's controversial ideas about this, right? But it's like, yeah, this idea that... And this gets back to just\nthis common experience of you walk into the\nkitchen and you're like, \"Why am I here?\" And you just end up grabbing\nsome food from the fridge and then you go back and you're\nlike, \"Oh, wait a minute, I left my watch in the kitchen. That's what I was looking for.\" And so what happens is, is that you have a little internal model of where you are, what you're thinking about, and when you cross from\none room to another those models get updated. And so now when you're in the\nkitchen you have to go back and mentally time travel\nback to this earlier point to remember what it was\nthat you went there for. And so these event boundaries... Turns out, like in our research, and, again, I don't wanna make\nit sound like we've figured out everything, but in our\nresearch, one of the things that we found is, is that\nbasically as people get older, the activity in the hippocampus\nat these event boundaries tends to go down. But independent of age,\nif I give you outside of the scanner, you're\ndone with the scanner, I just scan you while\nyou're watching a movie, you just watch it, you\ncome out, I give you a test of memory for stories, what happens is you find\nthis incredible correlation between the activity in the hippocampus at these singular points in time, these event boundaries, and your ability to just remember a story outside of the scanner later on. So it's marking this\nability to encode memories, just these little snippets\nof neural activity. So I think that's a big one. There's all sorts of work in animal models that I can get into, you know, sleep. I think there's so much interesting stuff that's being discovered\nin sleep right now. Being able to just record from\nlarge populations of cells and then be able to relate that. You know, one, I think the coolest thing, gets back to this QR code thing, because like what we can do\nnow is like I can take FMRI data while you're watching a movie... Or let's do better than that. Let me get FMRI data\nwhile you use a joystick to move around in virtual reality. You're in the metaverse, whatever, right? But it's kind of a crappy metaverse 'cause there's always so\nmuch metaverse you can do in an MRI scanner. So you're doing this\ncrappy metaverse thing. So now I can take a rat,\nrecord from his hippocampus and prefrontal cortex,\nand all these areas, with these really new electrodes and get massive amounts of data and have it move around on a\ntrack ball in virtual reality in the same metaverse that I did and record that rats activity. I can get a person with epilepsy, who we have electrodes\nin their brain anyway to try to figure out where\nthe seizures are coming from, and if it's a healthy part of the brain record from that person, right? And I can get a computational model. And one of the brand new\nmembers in my lab, Tyler Bonnen, is just doing some great stuff. He relates computer vision models and looks at the weaknesses\nof computer vision models and relates it to what\nthe brain does well. - [Lex] Mm, nice. - And so you can actually\ntake a ground truth, you know, code for the\nmetaverse, basically, And you can feed in\nthe visual information, let's say the sensory information, or whatever, that's coming\nin to a computational model that's designed to take\nreal world inputs, right? And you could basically\ntie them all together by virtue of the state\nspaces that you're measuring in neural activity in\nthese different formats, and these different species, And in the computational\nmodel, which is just... I just find that mind blowing. You could do different kinds\nof analyses on language and basically come up with just like the, basically it's the guts of LLMs, right? You have, you could do\nanalyses on language and you could do analyses on,\nyou know, sentiment analysis of emotions and so forth. Put all the stuff together. I mean, it's almost too much. But if you do it right, and you\ndo it in a theory driven way as opposed to just throwing\nall the data at the wall and see what sticks, I mean that to me is just\nexceptionally powerful. - So you can take FMRI\ndata in across species and across different types of humans, or conditions of humans and,\nwhat, find construct models that help you find the commonalities, or like the core thing that\nmakes somebody navigate through the metaverse, for example? - Yeah, yeah. I mean more or less. I mean there's a lot of\ndetails but yes, I think... And not just FMRI, but you can relate it to, like I said, recordings from large\npopulations of neurons that could be taken in a human or even in a non-human animal, that is, you know, where you think it's an anatomical homolog. So that's just mind blowing to me. - What's the similarities\nin humans and mice? (Charan laughing) - I love it.\n- That's what The Smashing Pumpkins, \"We're\nall just rats in a cage.\" Is that Smashing Pumpkins? - \"Despite all of your rage.\" - Is that Smashing Pumpkins? I think, or all- - Despite all of your rage at GIFs, you're still just rat in a cage. - Oh, yeah. All right, good callback. Anyway.\n- It is a good callback. See these memory retrieval\nexercise I'm doing are actually helping you\nbuild a lasting memory of this conversation. - And it's strengthening the\npic, the visual thing I have of you with James Brown on stage. It's just becoming stronger\nand stronger by the second. Anyway-\n- The hot tub. (both laughing) - But animal studies work here as well? - Yeah, yeah. So, okay, so let's go to the... So I think recent, I've got,\nyou know, great colleagues who I talk to who study memory in mice, you know, and there's some... One of the valuable things in those models is you can study neural circuits in an enormously targeted way because you could do these\ngenetic studies, for instance, where you can manipulate\nlike particular groups of neurons and it's just\ngetting more and more targeted, to the point where you\ncan actually turn on a particular kind of\nmemory just by activating a particular set of\nneurons that was active during an experience. Right? So there's a lot of conservation of some of these neural\ncircuits across, you know, evolution in mammals for instance. And then, you know, some\npeople would even say that there's genetic\nmechanisms for learning that are conservative even\ngoing back far, far before. But let's go back to the mice\nand humans question, right? There's a lot of differences. So for one thing, the sensory\ninformation is very different. Mice and rats explore the world largely through smelling, olfaction, but they also have vision\nthat's kind of designed to kind of catch death from above. So it's like a very big view of the world. And we move our eyes around in a way that focuses on particular spots in space where you get very high resolution from a very limited set of spots in space. So that makes us very\ndifferent in that way. We also have all these other\nstructures as social animals that allow us to respond differently. There's language, there's\nlike, you know, so you name it, there's obviously gobs of differences. Humans aren't just giant rats, there's much more complexity to us. Timescales are very important. So primate brains and human\nbrains are especially good at integrating and and\nholding on to information across longer and longer periods of time. Right? And and also, you know,\nfinally it's like our history of training data, so to\nspeak, is very, very different than, you know, I mean a\nhuman's world is very different than a wild mouse's world. And a lab mouse's world is\nextraordinarily impoverished relative to an adult human. You know? - But still, what can you\nunderstand by studying mice? I mean just basic, almost\nbehavioral stuff about memory? - Well yes, but that's\nvery important, right? So you can understand for\ninstance, how do neurons talk to each other? That's a really big, big question. Neural computation in and of itself... You'd think it's the most\nsimple question, right? Not at all. I mean it's a big, big question and understanding how two\nparts of the brain interact, meaning that it's not\njust one area speaking, it's not like, you know,\nit's not like Twitter where one area of the brain's shouting and then another area of the\nbrain's just stuck listening to this crap. It's like they're actually interacting on the millisecond scale, right? How does that happen,\nand how do you regulate those interactions, these\ndynamic, you know, interactions? We're still figuring that out. But that's gonna be coming\nlargely from model systems that are easier to understand. You can do manipulations\nlike drug manipulations to manipulate circuits and, you know, use viruses, and so forth, and lasers to turn on circuits that you just can't do in humans. So I think there's a lot that\ncan be learned from mice, there's a lot that can be\nlearned from non-human primates, and then there's a lot that\nyou need to learn from humans. And I think, unfortunately,\nsome of the people in the National Institutes\nof Health think you can learn everything from the mouse. Like why study memory in\nhumans when I could study learning in a mouse? And just like, oh my god,\nI'm gonna get my funding from somewhere else. So... - Well let me ask you some\nrandom, fascinating questions. - [Charan] Yeah, sure. - How does deja vu work? - So deja vu is, it's actually\none of these things I think that some of the surveys\nsuggest that like 75% of people report having\na deja vu experience one time or another. I don't know where that came from but I've polled people in my class and most of them say\nthey've experienced deja vu. It's this kind of sense that\nI've experienced this moment sometime before, I've been here before. And actually there's all\nsorts of variants of this. The French have all sorts of names for various versions of this. (speaking in French) I dunno, whatever, it's like\nall these different vus. - [Lex] Yeah. - But deja vu is the sense that it can be like an almost disturbing,\nintense sense of familiarity. So there was a researcher\nnamed Wilder Penfield. Actually, this goes back even earlier, to some of the earliest... Like Hughlings Jackson was\nthis neurologist who did a lot of the early\ncharacterizations of epilepsy. And one of the things he\nnotices in epilepsy patients, some group of them, right\nbefore they would get a seizure, they would have this\nintense sense of deja vu. So it's this artificial\nsense of familiarity, it's a sense of having a\nmemory that's not there. Right? And so what was happening was\nthere was electrical activity in certain parts of these brains\nand so this guy, Penfield, later on, when he was trying to look for how do we map out\nthe brain to figure out which parts we wanna remove\nand which parts don't we, he would stimulate parts of\nthe temporal lobes of the brain and find you could elicit\nthe sense of deja vu. Sometimes you'd actually get a memory, that a person would re-experience, just from electrically\nstimulating some parts. Sometimes though they would\njust have this intense feeling of being somewhere before. And so one theory which I really like is, is that in higher\norder areas of the brain that are integrating for\nmany, many different, you know, sources of input what happens is, is that they're tuning themselves up every time you process\na similar input, right? And so that allows you to just get this kind of affluent sense\nthat I'm very familiar, you're very familiar\nwith this place, right? And so just being here, you're not going to be moving your eyes all over the place 'cause you kind of have an\nidea of where everything is. And that fluency gives you\na sense of like, I'm here. Now I wake up in my hotel room and I have this very unfamiliar\nsense of where I am, right? But, you know, there's a\ngreat set of studies done by Anne Cleary at Colorado State where she created these\nvirtual reality environments. And we'll go back to the metaverse. Imagine you go through\na virtual museum, right? And then she would put\npeople in virtual reality and have them go through a virtual arcade. But the map of the two\nplaces was exactly the same, she just put different skins on them so one looks different than the other, but they've got same landmarks and same places, same\nobjects and everything. But carpeting, colors, theme,\neverything's different. People will often not\nhave any conscious idea that the two are the same, but they could report this\nvery intense sense of deja vu. So it's like a partial\nmatch that's soliciting this kind of a sense of familiarity. And that's why, you know, in\npatients who have epilepsy that affects memory, you\nget this artificial sense of familiarity that happens. And so we think that... And, again, this is just\none theory amongst many, but we think we get a\nlittle bit of that feeling, it's not enough to\nnecessarily give you deja vu, even for very mundane things, right? So it's like if I tell\nyou the word rutabaga, your brain's gonna work a\nlittle bit harder to catch it than if I give you word like apple. Right? And that's 'cause you hear apple a lot, so your brain's very tuned\nup to process it efficiently. But rutabaga takes a little\nbit longer, and more intense. And you can actually see a\ndifference in brain activity in areas in the temporal\nlobe when you hear a word just based on how frequent it\nis in the English language. So- - [Lex] That's fascinating. - We think it's tied to this basic... It's a basically a\nbyproduct of our mechanism of just learning, doing this\nerror driven learning as we go through life to become better and better and better to process things\nmore and more efficiently. - So I guess deja vu was\njust thinking extra elevated, the stuff coming together, firing for this artificial memory\nas if it's the real memory. I mean, why does it feel so intense? - Well, it doesn't happen all the time, but I think what may be\nhappening is it's such a... It's a partial match to\nsomething that we have and it's not enough to trigger\nthat sense of, you know, that ability to pull\ntogether all the pieces but it's a close enough match\nto give you that intense sense of familiarity without the recollection of exactly what happened when. - But it's also like a\nspatial temporal familiarity. So like it's also in time. Like there's a weird blending\nof time that happens. And we'll probably talk about time, 'cause I think that's a\nreally interesting idea. - Yeah.\n- How time relates to memory. But you also kind of... Artificial memory brings to\nmind this idea of false memories that comes in all kinds of contexts. But how do false memories form? - Well I like to say there's\nno such thing as true or false memories, right? It's like Johnny Rotten\nfrom the Sex Pistols, he had a saying that's like, \"I don't believe in false memories anymore than I believe in false songs.\" Right? It's like... And so the basic idea is is\nthat we have these memories that reflect bits and\npieces of what happened as well as our inferences\nand theories, right? So I'm a scientist and I collect data, but I use theories to\nmake sense of that data. And so a memory is kind of\na mix of all these things. So where memories can go off the deep end and become what we would call conventionally as false memories are sometimes little distortions where we filled in the blanks,\nthe gaps in our memory, based on things that we know but don't actually\ncorrespond to what happened. Right? So if I were to tell you\nthat I'm like, you know a story about this\nperson who's like worried that they have cancer, or something like that, and\nthen, you know, they see a doctor and the doctor says, \"Well, things are very much\nlike you would've expected.\" Or like, you know, what you\nwere afraid of or something. When people remember that\nthey'll often remember, well the doctor told the\npatient that he had cancer, even if that wasn't in the story, because they're infusing\nmeaning into that story. Right? So that's a minor distortion. But what happens is, is\nthat sometimes things can really get outta hand\nwhere people have trouble telling the difference between\nthings that they've imagined versus things that happened. But also, as I told you, the act of remembering\ncan change the memory. And so what happens then is\nyou can actually be exposed to some misinformation. And so Elizabeth Loftus was\na real pioneer in this work, and there's lots of other\nwork that's been done since. But basically it's like\nif you remember some event and then I tell you\nsomething about the event later on when you remember\nthe event you might remember some original information from the event as well as some information\nabout what I told you. And sometimes if you're not\nable to tell the difference, that information that\nI told you gets mixed into the story that you had originally. So now I give you some\nmore misinformation, or you're exposed to some more\ninformation somewhere else, and eventually your memory\nbecomes totally detached from what happened. And so sometimes you can\nhave cases where people, this is very rare, but\nyou can do it in lab too, where like a, you know,\nsignificant, not everybody but, you know, a chunk of\npeople will fall for this, where you can give people\nmisinformation about an event that never took place and as\nthey keep trying to remember that event more and more and\nwhat happens is they start to imagine, they start to pull up things from other experiences they've had and eventually they can\nstitch together a vivid memory of something that never happened. Because they're not remembering\nan event that happened, they're remembering the\nact of trying to remember what happened and basically\nputting it together into the wrong story. - So it's fascinating, 'cause\nthis could probably happen at a collective level. Like this is probably what\nsuccessful propaganda machines aim to do, this creating false memory across thousands if not millions of minds. - Yeah, absolutely. I mean this is exactly what they do. And so all these kind of\nfoibles of human memory get magnified when you start\nto have social interactions. So there's a whole literature on something called social contagion, which is basically when\nmisinformation spreads like a virus. Like you remember the\nsame thing that I did, but I give you a little\nbit of wrong information, then that becomes part of\nyour story of what happened. Because once you and I share\na memory, like I tell you about something I've\nexperienced and you tell me about your experience at the same event, it's no longer your memory or\nmy memory, it's our memory. And so now the misinformation spreads. And the more you trust someone, or the more powerful that person is, the more of a voice they have\nin shaping that narrative. Right? And there's all sorts of interesting ways in which misinformation can happen. There's a great example\nof when John McCain and George Bush Jr. were in a primary, and there were these polls where they would do these like... I guess they were like not\nrobocalls, but real calls where they would poll voters but they actually inserted\nsome misinformation about McCain's beliefs\non taxation I think, and maybe it was something\nabout illegitimate children, I don't really remember, but they included\nmisinformation in the question that they asked. Like, you know, \"How do\nyou feel about the fact that he wants to do this?\" Or something. And so people would end\nup becoming convinced he had these, you know, policy things, or these personal things,\nthat were not true, just based on the polls\nthat were being used. So it was a case where,\ninterestingly enough, the people who were using misinformation were actually ahead of the\ncurve relative to the scientists who were trying to study\nthese effects in memory. - Yeah, it's... It's really interesting. So it's not just about truth\nand falsehood as like us as intelligent reasoning machines, but it's the formation of\nmemories where they become like visceral, you can rewrite history. If you just look\nthroughout the 20th century some of the dictatorships\nwith Nazi Germany, with the Soviet Union,\neffective propaganda machines can rewrite our conceptions of history, how we remember our own\nculture, our upbringing, all this kind of stuff. And you could do quite a\nlot of damage in this way. And then there's probably some kind of social contagion happening there. Like certain ideas that may be initiated by the propaganda machine can\nspread faster than others. You could see that in modern day, certain conspiracy theories. There's just something about them that they are like really\neffective at spreading. There's something sexy\nabout them to people, to where something about\nthe human mind eats it up and then uses that to construct memories as if they almost were there to witness whatever the content of\nthe conspiracy theory is. It's fascinating 'cause once\nyou feel like you remember a thing, I feel like there's a certainty, there's a... It emboldens you to like say stuff. Like you really like... It's not just you believe\nan ideas true or not, you're like, it's at\nthe core of your being that you feel like you were\nthere to watch the thing happen. - Yeah, I mean there's so\nmuch in what you're saying. I mean, one of the things\nis, is that people's sense of collective identity is very\nmuch tied to shared memories. If we have a shared narrative of the past, or even better, if we have a shared past we will feel more socially\nconnected with each other, and I will feel part of this group. They're part of my tribe if I remember the same\nthings in the same way. And you brought up this\nweaponization of history and, you know, it really\nspeaks to, I think, one of the parts of memory, which is that if you have a belief you will find, and you\nhave a goal in mind, you will find stuff in\nmemory that aligns with it and you won't see the\nparts in memory that don't. So a lot of the stories we put together are based on our perspectives. Right? And so let's just zoom out for the moment from like misinformation to take something even more fascinating, but not as like, you know, scary. You know, I was reading Thanh Viet Nguyen, but he wrote a book about\nthe collective memory of the Vietnam War. He is a Vietnamese\nimmigrant who was flown out after the war was over. And so he went back to his family to get their stories about the war and they called it the American\nWar, not the Vietnam War. Right? And that just kind of blew my mind, having grown up in the US,\nand having always heard about it as the Vietnam War. But of course they call\nit the American War, 'cause that's what happened. America came in, right? And that's based on their perspective, which is a very valid perspective. And so that just gives you this idea of the way we put\ntogether these narratives based on our perspectives. And I think the opportunities\nthat we can have in memory is if we bring groups together\nfrom different perspectives and we allow them to talk to each other and we allow ourselves to listen. I mean, right now you'll\nhear a lot of just jammering, you know, people going blah,\nblah blah about free speech, but they just wanna listen to themselves. Right? I mean it's like, let's\nface it, the old days before people were supposedly woke they were trying to ban 2\nLive Crew, or, you know. Just think about, Lenny Bruce\ngot canceled for cursing. Jesus Christ.\n- Yeah. - [Charan] You know, it's like- - Yeah.\n- This is nothing new. - Yeah.\n- People don't like to hear things that disagree with them. But if you're in a... I mean you can see two\nsituations in groups with memory. One situation is you have like\npeople who are very dominant, who just take over the\nconversation, and they... Basically what happens\nis the group remembers less from the experience and they remember more of what\nthe dominant narrator says. Right? Now, if you have a\ndiverse group of people, and I don't mean diverse in\nnecessarily the human resources sense of the word, I\nmean diverse in any way you want to take it, right? But diverse in every way, hopefully. And you give everyone a chance to speak, and everyone's being appreciated for their unique contribution, you get more accurate memories and you get more information from it. Right? Even two people who come from\nvery similar backgrounds, if you can appreciate\nthe unique contributions that each one has, you can do a better job of generating information from memory. And that's a way to inoculate\nourselves, I believe, from misinformation in the modern world. But, like everything else, it requires a certain\ntolerance for discomfort. And I think when we don't have much time, and I think when we're stressed out and when we are just tired, it's very hard to tolerate discomfort. - And I mean, social media\nhas a lot of opportunity for this because it\nenables this distributed one-on-one interaction\nthat you're talking about where everybody has a voice, but still our natural inclination... You see this on social media,\nthere's a natural clustering of people and opinions and\nyou just kind of, you know, form these kind of bubbles. I think that's... To me personally, I think\nthat's a technology problem that could be solved. If there's a little bit of interaction, kind, respectful,\ncompassionate interaction with people that have a\nvery different memory, that respectful interaction\nwill start to intermix the memories and ways of thinking to where you're slowly\nmoving towards truth. But that's a technology problem because naturally, left\nto our own devices, we wanna cluster up in a tribe. - Yeah, and that's the human problem. - Yeah.\n- You know. I think a lot of the problems that come up with technology aren't\nthe technology itself as much as the fact that\npeople adapt to the technology in maladaptive ways. I mean, one of my fears about\nAI is not what AI will do, but what people will do. I mean, take text messaging, right? It's like it's a pain in\nthe ass to text people, at least for me. And so what happens is the communication becomes very spartan and\ndevoid of meaning, right? It's just very telegraphic. And that's people adapting\nto the medium, right? I mean look at you, you've\ngot this keyboard, right? That's like got these\nlike dome shaped things, and you've adapted to that\nto communicate, right? That's not the technology adapting to you, that's you adapting to the technology. And I think with, you know,\none of the things I learned when Google started to introduce\nauto complete in emails, I started to use it and\nabout a third of the time I was like, \"This isn't what I wanna say.\" A third of the time I'd be like, \"This is exactly what I wanted to say.\" And a third of the time I was saying, \"Well this is good enough,\nI'll just go with it.\" Right? And so what happens is it's\nnot that the technology necessarily is doing anything so bad as much as it's just going\nto constrain my language because I'm just doing\nwhat's being suggested to me. And so this is why I say, you\nknow, kinda like my mantra for some of what I've learned\nabout everything in memory is to diversify your\ntraining data basically. Because otherwise you're going to be... So like humans have this\ncapability to be so much more creative than anything\ngenerative AI will put together. At least right now, who\nknows where this goes. But it can also go the opposite direction where people could become\nmuch, much less creative if they just become more\nand more like resistant to discomfort, you know,\nand resistant to exposing themselves to novelty, to\ncognitive dissonance and so forth. - I think there is a dance\nbetween natural human adaptation of technology and the people\nthat design the engineering of that technology. So I think there's a lot\nof opportunity to create, like this keyboard,\nthings on net are positive for human behavior. So we adapt, and all this kind of stuff, but when you look at the long\narc of history across years and decades, has humanity\nbeen flourishing? Are humans creating more awesome stuff? Are humans happier? All that kind of stuff. And so there, I think\ntechnology on net has been, and I think, maybe hope,\nwill always be on net a positive thing. - Do you think people are happier now than they were 50 years\nago, or 100 years ago? - Yes. Yes. - I don't know about that. - I think humans in\ngeneral like to reminisce about the past, like\nthat times were better. - [Charan] That's true. - And complain about the weather today, or complain about whatever today, 'cause we, there's this\nkind of complainy engine that's just, there's so\nmuch pleasure in saying, you know, \"Life sucks.\" For some reason. - That's why I love punk rock. - Exactly. I mean there's something in\nhumans that loves complaining, even about trivial things. But complaining about change,\ncomplaining about everything. But ultimately I think,\non net, on every measure, things are getting better,\nlife is getting better. - Oh, life is getting better, but I don't know that necessarily that tracks people's happiness, right? I mean, I would argue\nthat maybe, who knows, I don't know this, but\nI wouldn't be surprised if people in hunter gatherer\nsocieties are happier. I mean, I wouldn't be\nsurprised if they're happier than people who have\naccess to modern medicine, and email, and cell phones. - Well I don't think there's\na question whether you take hunter gatherer folks and\nput them into modern day and give 'em enough time to adapt, they would be much happier. The question is, in terms\nof every single problem they've had is now solved. There's now food, there's\nguarantee of survival, and shelter, and all this kind of stuff. - Oh.\n- So what you're asking is a deeper sort of biological question. Do we want to be a Werner Herzog, that movie, \"Happy People:\nLife in the Taiga?\" Do we want to be busy 100% of\nour time hunting, gathering, surviving, worried about the next day? Maybe that constant\nstruggle ultimately creates a more fulfilling life. I don't know. But I do know this\nmodern society allows us to, when we're sick, to find\nmedicine, to find cures, when we're hungry, to get food, much more than we did even 100 years ago. And there's many more activities\nthat you could perform, all creative, all these kinds of stuff, that enables the flourishing of humans at the individual level. Whether that leads to happiness, I mean, that's a very deep\nphilosophical question. Maybe struggle, deep struggle,\nis necessary for happiness. - Or maybe cultural connection. You know, maybe it's about like\nfunctioning in social groups that are meaningful, and like having time. But I do think this is,\nthere's an interesting memory related thing,\nwhich is that if you look at like things like reinforcement learning for instance, you're not\nlearning necessarily every time you get a reward, if it's the same reward, you're not learning that much. You mainly learn if it\ndeviates from your expectation of what you're supposed to get, right? So it's like you get a\npaycheck every, you know, month from MIT, or whatever, right? And it's like you're kind\nof, you probably don't even kind of get excited about it\nwhen you get the paycheck. But if they cut your salary,\nyou're gonna be pissed. And if they increase your salary, you go, \"Oh, good, I got a bonus.\" You know? And that adaptation and that ability that basically you learn\nto expect these things, I think, is a major source\nof, I guess it's a major way in which we're kind of more,\nin my opinion, wired to strive and not be happy to be\nin a state of wanting. And, you know, so people\ntalk about dopamine for instance, being\nthis pleasure chemical. And it's like there's a\nlot of compelling research to suggest it's not about pleasure at all, it's about the discomfort\nthat energizes you to get things, to seek a reward, right? And so you could give an\nanimal that's been deprived of dopamine a reward and,\n\"Oh, yeah, I enjoy it. It's pretty good.\" But they're not gonna\ndo anything to get it. You know? And just one of the weird\nthings in our research is, is we, I got into\ncuriosity from a postdoc in my lab, Matthias Gruber,\nand one of the things that we found is when we\ngave people a question, like a trivia question, that\nthey wanted the answer to. That question, the more curious people were about the answer, the more activity in these dopamine related\ncircuits in the brain we would see. And, again, that was not\ndriven by the answer per se, but by the question. So it was not about\ngetting the information, it was about the drive\nto seek the information. But it depends on how you take that. If you get this uncomfortable\ngap between what you know and what you want to\nknow, you could either use that to motivate you and energize you, or you could use it to say, \"I\ndon't wanna hear about this, this disagrees with my beliefs, I'm gonna go back to my echo chamber.\" You know? - Mm-hmm, yeah. I like what you said\nthat maybe we're designed to be in a kind of\nconstant state of wanting, which by the way is a\npretty good either band name or rock song name, state of wanting. - That's like a hardcore band name. - Hardcore band.\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Lex] Yeah, it's pretty good. - But I also like the hedonic treadmill. - Hedonic treadmill's pretty good. - Yeah, yeah, we could use that\nfor like our techno project, I think. - You mean the one we're starting? - Yeah, exactly.\n- Okay, great. We're going on tour soon. (Charan laughing) This is our announcement. - We could build a false\nmemory of a show in fact, if we want. Let's just put it all together so... We don't even have to do all\nthe work to play the show, we can just create a memory of it. It might as well happen, 'cause the remembering\nitself is in charge anyway. - So let me ask you about, we\ntalked about false memories, but, you know, in the legal\nsystem, false confessions. I remember reading \"1984,\" where, sorry for the dark turn\nof our conversation, but through torture\nyou can make people say anything and essentially\nremember anything. I wonder to which degree\nthere's like truth to that. If you look at the torture that\nhappened in the Soviet Union for confessions, all that kind of stuff. How much can you really\nget people to really, you know, to force\nfalse memories, I guess? - Yeah, I mean I think\nthere's a lot of history of this actually in the\ncriminal justice system. You might have heard the\nterm the third degree. If you actually look it up, historically, it was a very\nintense set of beatings and, you know, starvation\nand physical demands that they would place on\npeople to get them to talk. And, you know, there was\ncertainly a lot of work that's been done by the CIA in terms of enhanced interrogation techniques. And, from what I understand,\nthe research actually shows that they just produce\nwhat people want to hear, not necessarily the information\nthat is being looked for. And the reason is, is that... I mean, there's different reasons. I mean, one is people just get tired of being tortured and just say whatever. But another part of it\nis, is that you create a very interesting set of conditions where there's an authority\nfigure telling you something that, \"You did\nthis, we know you did this, we have witnesses saying you did this.\" So now you start to question yourself. Then they put you under stress. Maybe they're not feeding you, maybe they're kinda\nlike making you be cold or, you know, exposing you to like music that you can't stand, or something. Whatever it is, right? It's like they're creating\nthis physical stress. And so stress starts to\nact on, you know, starts to downregulate the prefrontal cortex. You're not necessarily\nas good at monitoring the accuracy of stuff. Then they start to get\nnice to you and they say, \"Imagine...\" You know, \"Okay, I know\nyou don't remember this, but maybe we can walk you through how it could have happened.\" And they feed you the information. And so you're in this\nweakened mental state and you're being encouraged\nto imagine things by people who give you\na plausible scenario. And at some point certain\npeople can be very coaxed into creating a memory for\nsomething that never happened. And there's actually some\npretty convincing cases out there where you don't\nknow exactly the truth. There's a sheriff, for\ninstance, who came to believe that he had a false memory. I mean that he had a memory\nof doing sexual abuse based on, you know,\nessentially I think it was... You know, I'm not gonna tell the story because I don't remember it well enough to necessarily accurately give it to you, but people could look this stuff up. There are definitely\nstories out there like this where people confess to crimes\nthat they just didn't do, and objective evidence came out later on. But there's a basic recipe for it, which is you feed people the information that you want them to\nremember, you stress them out, you have an authority figure kind of like pushing\nthis information on them, or you motivate them to\nproduce the information you're looking for. And that pretty much over\ntime gives you what you want. - It's really tragic\nthat centralized power can use these kinds of\ntools to destroy lives. Sad. Since there's a theme about music throughout this conversation, one of the best topics\nfor songs is heartbreak, love in general, but heartbreak. Why and how do we remember\nand forget heartbreak? Asking for a friend. - Oh, God, that's so hard to... Asking for a friend, I love that. Oh, it's such a hard one. Well, so I mean part of\nthis is we tend to go back to particular times that are the more\nemotionally intense periods. And so that's a part of it. And, again, memory's designed to kind of capture these things that are biologically significant, and attachment is a, you know, big part of biological significance for humans. Right? Human relationships are super important. And sometimes that heartbreak\ncomes with massive changes in your beliefs about somebody, say if they cheated on you,\nor something like that, or regrets, and you kind\nof ruminate about things that you've done wrong. There's really so many reasons though. But, you know, I mean, I've had this. My first pet I had as, you know, was, we got it for a\nwedding present, was a cat and got it after like... But it died of FIP when\nit was four years old. And, you know, I just\nwould see her everywhere around the house, you know. We got another cat, then we got a dog, dog eventually died of cancer and the cat just died recently. And, you know, so we got a new dog because I kept seeing the dog around and I was just so heartbroken\nabout this, and... But I still remember the pets that died. It just comes back to you. I mean, it's part of this... I think there's also\nsomething about attachment that's just so crucial that drives, again, these things that we want to remember and that gives us that longing sometimes. Sometimes it's also not\njust about the heartbreak, but about the positive\naspects of it, right? 'Cause the loss comes\nfrom not only the fact that the relationship is over, but you had all of these good things before that you can now\nsee in a new light, right? And so part of, one of the things that I found from my clinical background that really I think gave\nme a different perspective on memory is so much\nof the therapy process was guided towards reframing\nand getting people to look at the past in a different way. Not by imposing, changing\npeople's memories, or not by imposing an interpretation, but just offering a different perspective and maybe one that's kind of\nmore optimized towards learning and, you know, and appreciation maybe, or gratitude, whatever it is, right? That gives you a way of taking... I think you said it in\nthe beginning, right? Where you can have this kind\nof like dark experiences and you can use it as training data to, you know, grow in new ways. But it's hard. - This... I often go back to this\nmoment, this show \"Louis,\" with Louis C.K., where he's\nall heartbroken about a breakup with a woman he loves and\nan older gentleman tells him that that's actually the\nbest part, that heartbreak, because you get to intensely experience how valuable this love was. He says the worst part is forgetting it. It's actually when you\nget over the heartbreak, that's the worst part. So I sometimes think about\nthat because, you know, having the love and losing it, like the losing it is\nwhen you sometimes feel it the deepest, which is a\ninteresting way to celebrate the past and relive it. It sucks that you don't have a thing, but when you don't have a\nthing it's a good moment to viscerally experience the memories of something that you\nnow appreciate even more. - So you don't believe that\nan owner of a lonely heart is much better than an\nowner of a broken heart? You think an owner of a broken heart is better than the\nowner of a lonely heart? - Yes, for sure. I think so. I think so. But I'm gonna have to, day by day... I don't know, I'm gonna have to listen to some more Bruce Springsteen\nto figure that one out. (Charan laughing) - Well, you know, it's funny because it's like after I turned 50 I think of death all the time. Like I just think that, you\nknow, I'm in, like, I probably, I have fewer, probably\nhave fewer years ahead of me than I have behind me, right? So I think about, I think about one thing, which is what are the memories\nthat I wanna carry with me for the next period of time? And also about like, just\nthe fact that everything around me could be, you\nknow, I know more people who are, you know, dying\nfor various reasons. And so... I mean, not lots, I'm not that old, right? It's like... But, you know, it's\nsomething I think about a lot and I'm reminded of like how I talk to somebody who's like,\nyou know, who's a Buddhist, and I was like, you know,\nthe whole idea of Buddhism is renouncing attachment. In some way the idea of\nBuddhism is like staying out of the world of memory and\nstaying in the moment, right? And they talked about, you\nknow, it's like how do you, how do you renounce\nattachments to the people that you love, right? And they're just saying, \"Well, I appreciate that I\nhave this moment with them and knowing that they will\ndie makes me appreciate this moment that much more.\" I mean, you said something similar, right? In your daily routine that you\nthink about things this way. Right? - Yeah, I meditate on mortality every day. But, I don't know, I... At the same time, that\nreally makes you appreciate the moment and live in the moment, and I also appreciate the\nfull, deep rollercoaster of suffering involved in life. The little and the big too. So I don't know. The Buddhist kinda removing\nyourself from the world, or the stoic removing\nyourself from the world, the world of emotion,\nI'm torn about that one. I'm not sure. - Well, you know, this is\nwhere Hinduism and Buddhism, or at least some strains of\nHinduism and Buddhism, differ. In Hinduism, like if you\nread the Bhagavad Gita, the philosophy is not one\nof renouncing the world, because the idea is, is\nthat not doing something is no different than\ndoing something, right? So what they argue... And, again, you could\ninterpret it in different ways, positive and negative, but the argument is, is that you don't\nwant to renounce action, but you want to renounce\nthe fruits of the action. You don't do it because of the outcome, you do it because of the process, because the process is part\nof the balance of the world that you're trying to preserve, right? And of course you could\ntake that different ways, but I really think about\nthat from time to time in terms of like, you know,\nletting go of this idea of does this book sell, or\ntrying to, you know, like impress you and get you to laugh\nat my jokes or whatever, and just be more like I'm\nsharing this information with you and, you know,\ngetting to know you, or whatever it is. But it's hard, right? It's like, 'cause we're so\ndriven by the reinforcer, the outcome. - You're just part of the\nprocess of telling the joke, and if I laugh or not, that's\nup to the universe to decide. - Yep, it's my dharma. - How does studying memory\naffect your understanding of the nature of time? So like we've been talking\nabout us living in the present and making decisions about the future, standing on the foundation\nof these memories and narratives about the\nmemories that we've constructed. So it feels like it does\nweird things to time. - Yeah, and the reason\nis, is that in some sense, I think, especially\nthe farther we go back, I mean there's all sorts of\ninteresting things that happen. So your sense of like if\nI ask you how different does one hour ago feel from two hours ago? You'd probably say pretty different. But if I ask you, okay,\ngo back one year ago versus one year and one hour ago, it's the same difference in time. It won't feel very different, right? So there's this kind of\ncompression that happens as you look back farther in time. So that it is kinda like\nwhy when you're older the difference between\nsomebody who's like 50 and, you know, 45 doesn't\nseem as big as the difference between like 10 and five\nor something, right? When you're 10 years old, everything seems like it's a long period of time. Here's the point is that, you know, so one of the interesting things that\nI found when I was working on the book actually,\nwas during the pandemic, I just decided to ask people in my class, when we were doing the remote instruction. So one of the things I did\nwas I would poll people. And so I just asked people, \"Do you feel like the\ndays are moving by slower or faster, or about the same?\" Almost everyone in the class said that the days were moving by slower. So then I would say, \"Okay, so do you feel like the weeks are passing by\nslower, faster or the same?\" And the majority of them said that the weeks were passing by faster. So, according to the laws of physics, I don't think that makes any sense, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - But according to memory it did, because what happened was\npeople were doing the same thing over and over in the same context. And without that change\nin context their feeling was that they were in one\nlong monotonous event. And so... But then at the end of\nthe week you look back at that week and you say,\n\"Well what happened?\" I have no memories of what happened. So that week just went by\nwithout even my noticing it. But that week went by during\nthe same amount of time as an eventful week where\nyou might've been going out, hanging out with friends, on\nvacation, or whatever, right? It's just that nothing happened because you're doing the\nsame thing over and over. So I feel like memory really\nshapes our sense of time, but it does so in part because context is so\nimportant for memory. - Well that compression you mentioned, it's an interesting process. 'Cause when I think about\nwhen I was like 12 or 15, I just fundamentally feel\nlike the same person. It's interesting what\nthat compression does. It makes me feel like it's\nall, we're all connected, not just amongst humans and spatially, but in terms, back in time, there's a kinda eternal nature, like the timelessness, I guess, to life. That could be also a\ngenetic thing just for me, I don't know if everyone\nagrees to this view of time. But to me it all feels the same. - Like you don't feel the\npassage of time, or... - No, I feel the passage\nof time the same way that your students did from day to day. There's certain markers that let you know that time has passed, you\ncelebrate birthdays, and so on. But the core of who I am\nand who others I know are, or events it like that\ncompression of my understanding of the world removes time. 'Cause time is not useful\nfor the compression. So like the details of\nthat time, at least for me, is not useful to understanding\nthe core of the thing. So... - Maybe what it is is is\nthat you really like to see connections between things. This is like really what motivates me in science actually too. But it's like when you\nstart recalling the past to, you know, and seeing the\nconnections between the past and present, now you have this kind of web of interconnected memories, right? And so I can imagine in that sense there is this kind of, the\npresent is with you, right? But what's interesting\nabout what you said too that struck me is that\nyour 16-year-old self was probably very complex, you know. And I, by the way, I'm the same way, but it's like it really is the source of a lot of darkness for me. So... But when like you can look\nback at like, let's say you hear a song that you used to play like before you would\ngo do a sports thing, or something like that. And you might not think\nof yourself as an athlete, but once you get back to that mental, you mentally time travel\nto that particular thing, you open up this little\ncompartment of yourself that wasn't there before, right? That didn't seem accessible before. Dan Schacter's lab did\nthis really cool study where they would ask people to either remember doing\nsomething altruistic or imagine doing something altruistic and that act made them more likely to want to do things for other people. So that act of mental\ntime travel can change who you are in the present. And we tend to think of... This goes back to that\nillusion of stability. And we tend to think of memory\nin this very deterministic way, that I am who I am\nbecause I have this past. But we have a very multifaceted\npast and can access different parts of it\nand change in the moment based on whatever part we wanna reach for. Right? - How does nostalgia connect\ninto this, like this desire and pleasure associated with going back? - Yeah, so my friend Felipe\nDe Brigard wrote this, and it just like blew my\nmind, where the word nostalgia was coined by a Swiss physician who was actually studying\ntraumatized soldiers, and so he described\nnostalgia as a disease. And the idea was it was bringing\nthese people extraordinary unhappiness because they're remembering how things used to be. And I think it's very complex. So as people get older, for instance, nostalgia can be an enormous\nsource of happiness, right? And being nostalgic can improve people's moods in the moment. But it just depends on\nwhat they do with it. Because what you can\nsometimes see is nostalgia has the opposite effect of thinking, \"Those were the good old days\nand those days are over.\" Right? It's like America used to be\nso great and now it sucks. Or, you know, my life used to\nbe so great when I was a kid and now it's not. Right? And you're selectively\nremembering the things that... I mean, we don't realize how selective our remembering self is. And so, you know, I lived\nthrough the seventies, it sucked, you know, it was like... Partly it sucked more for me, but I would say that even otherwise it's like there's all\nsorts of problems going on. Gas lines, people were like, you know, worried about like Russia,\nnuclear war, blah, blah blah. So I mean it's just this idea that people have about the\npast can be very useful if it brings you happiness in the present, but if it narrows your\nworldview in the present, you're not aware of those\nbiases that you have, you will end up, you can end\nup, it can be toxic, right? Either at a personal level\nor at a collective level. - Let me ask you both a practical question and an out there question. So let's start with\nthe more practical one. What are your thoughts about BCIs, brain-computer interfaces, and the work that's\ngoing on with Neuralink? We talked about electrodes and different ways of measuring the brain and here Neuralink is working on basically two-way\ncommunication with the brain. And the more out there\nquestion will be like, where does this go? But more practically in the near term, what do you think about Neuralink? - Yeah, I mean I can't say\nspecifics about the company 'cause I haven't studied it that much. But I mean, I think\nthere's two parts of it. So one is they're developing\nsome really interesting technology, I think with\nthese like surgical robots, and things like that. BCI though has like a whole\nlot of innovation going on and I'm not necessarily\nseeing any scientific evidence from Neuralink, and maybe that's just 'cause I'm not looking\nfor it, but I'm not seeing the evidence that they're anywhere near where the scientific community is. And there's lots of startups that are doing incredibly\ninnovative stuff. One of my colleagues Sergey\nStavisky is just like a genius in this area and they're working on it. I think speech prosthetics\nlike that are incorporating, you know, decoding techniques with AI and, you know, movement perspectives. It's just like the rate of\nprogress is just enormous. So part of the technology\nis having good enough data and understanding which data to use and what to do with it, right? And then the other part of\nit then is the algorithms for decoding it and so forth. And I think part of\nthat has really resulted in some real breakthroughs\nin neuroscience as a result. So there's lots of new\ntechnologies like neuropixels, for instance, that allow\nyou to harvest activity from many, many neurons\nfrom a single electrode. I know Neuralink has some technologies that are also along these\nlines, but I haven't... Again, because they do their own stuff, the scientific community doesn't see it. Right? But I think BCI is much,\nmuch bigger than Neuralink and there's just so much\ninnovation happening. I think the interesting\nquestion which we may be getting into is, I was talking\nto Sergey a while ago about, you know, so a lot of language, it's not just what we\nhear and what we speak, but also our intentions\nand our internal models and, you know, so are\nyou really gonna be able to restore language without\ndealing with that part of it? And he brought up a really\ninteresting question, which is the ethics of reading\nout people's intentions and understanding of the\nworld as opposed to the more, you know, the more\nconcrete parts of hearing and producing movements. Right? - Just so we're clear, 'cause you said a few interesting things. When we talk about language and BCIs, what we mean is getting\nsignal from the brain and generating the language. Say you're not able to actually speak, it's as a kind of linguistic prosthetic, or it's able to speak for you exactly what you wanted to say. And then the deeper question\nis, well, saying something isn't just the letters, the\nwords that you're saying, it's also the intention behind it, the feeling behind,\nall that kind of stuff, and is it ethical to\nreveal that full shebang, the full context of what's\ngoing on in our brain. That's really... That's really interesting. That's really interesting. I mean, our thoughts, is it ethical for anyone to\nhave access to our thoughts? Because right now the re\nthe resolution is so low that we're okay with it, even doing studies and\nall this kind of stuff. But if neuroscience\nhas a few breakthroughs to where you can start\nto map out the QR codes for different thoughts, for\ndifferent kinds of thoughts, maybe political thoughts,\nyou know, McCarthyism, what if I'm getting a lot\nof them communist thoughts? Or however we want to\ncategorize or label it. That's interesting. That's really interesting. I think ultimately this\nalways the more transparency there is about the human\nmind, the better it is. But there could be always\nintermediate battles with how much control\ndoes a centralized entity have, like a government and so on. What is the regulation,\nwhat are the rules? What are the... What's legal and illegal? You know, if you talk about the police whose job is to track\ndown criminals, and so on, and you look at all the history, how the police could abuse its power to control the citizenry,\nall that kind of stuff. So people are always\nparanoid, and rightfully so. It's fascinating. It's really fascinating. You know, we talk about freedom of speech, you know, freedom of thought, which is also a very important liberty at the core of this country,\nand probably humanity, starts to get awfully tricky\nwhen you start to be able to collect those thoughts. But what I wanted to actually\nask you is do you think, for fun and for practical\npurposes, you'll be able to, we would be able to modify memories? So how difficult is it to... How far away we are from\nunderstanding the different parts of the brain, everything\nwe've been talking about, in order to figure out how\ncan we adjust this memory at the crude level from\nunpleasant to pleasant? You talked about we can remember the mall and the people, like\nlocation of the people. Can we keep the people\nand change the place? Like this kind of stuff. How difficult is that? - Well, I mean in some sense we know we can do it just behaviorally, right? - [Lex] Behaviorally, yes. - I can just like tell you, give, you know, under\ncertain conditions anyway, I can give you the misinformation and then you can change the people and the places and so forth, right? On the crude level, there's a lot of work that's being done on a phenomenon\ncalled reconsolidation, which is the idea that essentially\nwhen I recall a memory, what happens is, is that the\nconnections between the neurons and that cell assembly\nthat give you the memory are going to be like more modifiable. And so some people have used techniques to try to like, for instance,\nwith fear memories to reduce that physical visceral\ncomponent of the memory when it's being activated. Right now I think I've, as an\noutsider looking at the data, I think it's like mixed results. And part of it is, and this\nspeaks to the more complex issue, is that you\ndon't, you need somebody to actually fully recall\nthat traumatic memory in the first place, in\norder to actually modify it. And then what is the memory? That is the key part of the problem. So if we go back to\nreading people's thoughts, what is the thought? I mean people can sometimes\nlook at this like behaviorists and go, \"Well the memory\nis like I've given you A and you produce B.\" But I think that's a very\nbankrupt concept about memory. I think it's much more\ncomplicated than that. And, you know, one of the\nthings that when we started studying naturalistic memory,\nlike memory from movies, that was so hard was we had to change the way we did the studies. Because if I show you a movie and I show and I watch the same movie and you recall everything that happened and I recall everything that happened, we might take a different\namount of time to do it, we might use different words, and yet to an outside observer we might have recalled the same thing. Right? So it's not about the words necessarily and it's not about how\nlong we spent, or whatever. There's something deeper that\nis there that's this idea. But it's like, how do you\nunderstand that thought? I encounter a lot of concrete thinking that it's like if I show\na model, like, you know, the visual information that a\nperson sees when they drive, I can basically reverse engineer driving. Well that's not really how it works. I once saw a talk by somebody, or I saw somebody talking\nin this discussion between neuroscientists and AI people and he was saying that the\nproblem with self-driving cars that they had in cities\nas opposed to highways was that the car was okay at,\nyou know, doing the things that it's supposed to, but\nwhen there were pedestrians around it couldn't predict\nthe intentions of people. And so that unpredictability\nof people was the problem that they were having in, you know, the self-driving car design. 'Cause it didn't have a\ngood enough internal model of what the people were, you know, what they were doing, what they wanted. And what do you think about that? - Well, I spent a huge amount\nof time watching pedestrians, thinking about pedestrians,\nthinking about what it takes to solve the problem of measuring, detecting the intention of a pedestrian, really, of a human being\nin this particular context of having to cross the street. And it's fascinating. I think... I think it's a window into\nhow complex social systems are that involve humans because, you know, I\nwould just stand there and watch intersections for hours. And what you start to\nfigure out is every single intersection has its own personality. So like there's a history\nto that intersection, like jaywalking. Certain intersections allow\njaywalking a lot more, because what happens is\nwe're leaders and followers. So there's a regular, let's\nsay, and they get off the subway and they start crossing on a red light, and they do this every single day. And then there's people that don't show up to that intersection often, and they're looking for cues of how we're supposed to behave here. And if a few people start to jaywalk and cross on a red light, they will also. They will follow. And there's just a dynamic\nto that intersection. There's a spirit to it. And if you look at Boston versus New York versus a rural town versus... Even Boston, San Francisco,\nor here in Austin, there's just different\npersonalities citywide, but there's different\npersonalities area wide, region wide, and there's\ndifferent personalities, different intersections. And it's just fascinating. For a car to be able to\ndetermine that is tricky. Now what machine learning\nsystems are able to do well is collect a huge amount of data. So for us it's tricky because we get to like\nunderstand the world with very limited information. - [Charan] That's right. - And make decisions grounded\nin this big foundation model that we've built of\nunderstanding how humans work. AI could literally, in\nthe context of driving, this is where I've often been really torn in both directions. If you just collect a huge amount of data, all of that information, and then compress it into a representation of\nhow humans cross streets, it's probably all there. In the same way that you\nhave a Noam Chomsky who says, \"No, no, no, AI can't talk, can't write convincing language without understanding language.\" And, you know, more and more\nyou see large language models without quote unquote\nunderstanding can generate very convincing language. But I think what the\nprocess of compression, from a huge amount of data\ncompressing into a representation is doing is in fact understanding deeply. In order to be able to\ngenerate one letter at a time, one word at a time, you have to understand the cruelty of Nazi Germany and the beauty of sending humans to space. And like you have to understand all of that in order to generate, like, \"I'm going to the\nkitchen to get an apple,\" and do that grammatically correctly. You have to have a world model that includes all of human behavior. - You think an LLM is\nbuilding that world model? - It has to, in order\nto be good at generating one word at a time in\na convincing sentence. And in the same way I\nthink AI that drives a car, if it has enough data, we'll\nbe able to form a world model that we'll be able to predict correctly what the pedestrian does. But when we as humans\nare watching pedestrians we slowly realize, \"Damn,\nthis is really complicated.\" In fact, when you start to\nself-reflect on driving, you realize driving is really complicated. There's like subtle cues\nwe take about like... Just, there's a million\nthings I could say, but like one of them,\ndetermining who around you is an asshole, aggressive driver. - Yes. Yes.\n- Potentially dangerous. - I was just thinking about this. Yes.\n- Or like- - You can read it a mile... Once you become a great driver\nyou can see it a mile away, this guy's gonna pull an\nasshole move in front of you. - [Lex] Yeah, exactly. - He's like way back there but\nyou know it's gonna happen. - And then I don't know what... 'Cause we're ignoring all the other cars. - Yeah.\n- But for some reason the asshole, like a red, like\na glowing, obvious symbol is just like right there\neven in the periphery vision. 'Cause we're, again, we're,\nusually when we're driving just looking forward, but we're like using the periphery vision to figure stuff out and it's like a little puzzle that we're usually only\nallocating a small amount of our attention to, at least\nlike cognitive attention to. And it's fascinating. But I think AI just has a\nfundamentally different suite of sensors, in terms of\nthe bandwidth of data that's coming in, that allows\nyou to form the representation and perform inference\non the representation using the representation you form that for the case of driving, I think it could be quite effective. But one of the things\nthat's currently missing, even though OpenAI just recently\nannounced adding memory. And I did wanna ask you\nlike how important it is, how difficult is it to add\nsome of the memory mechanisms that you've seen in humans to AI systems? - I would say superficially not that hard, but then in a deeper\nlevel, very, very hard. Because we don't understand\nepisodic memory, right? So one of the ideas I\ntalk about in the book is one of the oldest kind of dilemmas in computational neurosciences,\nwhat Steve Grossberg called the stability plasticity dilemma, right? When do you say something is new and overwrite your preexisting knowledge versus going with what you had before and making incremental changes? And so, you know, part of the problem with going through like\nmassive, you know what I mean? Part of the problem of\nthings like if you're trying to design an LLM, or something like that, is, especially for English,\nthere's so many exceptions to the rules, right? And so if you wanna rapidly\nlearn the exceptions, you're gonna lose the rules. And if you wanna keep the rules, you have a harder time\nlearning the exception. And so David Marr is one\nof the early pioneers in computational neuroscience, and then Jay McClelland and my colleague Randy O'Reilly, some other people like Neil\nCohen, all these people started to come up with the idea that maybe that's part of what we need in what the human brain is doing is we have this kind of a,\nactually a fairly dumb system, which just says this happened\nonce at this point in time, which we call episodic\nmemory, so to speak, and then we have this knowledge that we've accumulated\nfrom our experiences as semantic memory. So now when we want to... We encounter a situation that's surprising and violates all our\nprevious expectations, what happens is, is that now\nwe can form an episodic memory here and the next time we're\nin a similar situation, boom, we can supplement our knowledge with this information\nfrom our episodic memory and reason about what the\nright thing to do is, right? So it gives us this enormous\namount of flexibility to stop on a dime and change\nwithout having to erase everything we've already learned. And that solution is incredibly powerful because it gives you\nof the ability to learn from so much less\ninformation, really, right? And it gives you that flexibility. So one of the things I think\nthat makes humans great is having both episodic\nand semantic memory. Now can you build something like that? You know, computational\nneuroscience people would say, \"Well, yeah, you just record a moment and you just get it and you're done.\" Right? But when do you record that moment? How much do you record? What's the information you prioritize and what's the information you don't? These are the hard questions. When do you use episodic memory? When do you just throw it away? And these are the hard\nquestions we're still trying to figure out in people. And then you start to think\nabout all these mechanisms that we have in the brain for figuring out some of these things. And it's not just one,\nbut it's many of them that are interacting with each other. And then you just take\nnot only the episodic and the semantic, but then you start to take the motivational,\nsurvival things, right? It's just like the fight\nor flight responses that we associate with particular things, or the kind of like reward motivation that we associate with\ncertain things, so forth. And those things are absent from AI. I frankly don't know if we want it. I don't necessarily want a\nself-motivated LLM, right? It's like... And then there's the problem\nof how do you even like build the motivations that should\nguide a proper reinforcement learning kind of thing, for instance? So a friend of mine, Sam\nGershman, I might be missing the quote exactly, but he basically said, \"You know, if I wanted to\ntrain like a typical AI model to make me as much money as possible, first thing I might do is sell my house.\" So it's not even just\nabout having one goal, or one objective, but just\nhaving all these competing goals and objectives, right? And then things start to\nget really complicated. - Well it's all interconnected. I mean, just even the thing\nyou've mentioned is the moment, you know, if we record\na moment like the... It's difficult to express\nconcretely what a moment is, like how deeply connected\nit is to the entirety of it. Maybe to record a moment you have to make a universe from scratch. Like you have to have, you\nhave to include everything, you have to include all\nthe emotions involved, all the context, all the\nthings that built around it, all the social connections,\nall the visual experiences, all the sensory experience, all of that, all the\nhistory that came before that moment is built on. And we somehow, we take all\nof that and we compress it and keep the useful parts and then integrate it\ninto the whole thing, into our whole narrative. And then each individual\nhas their own little version of that narrative and then we collide. In a social way.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] And then we\nadjust it, and we evolve. - Yeah, yeah. I mean, well even if we\nwanna go super simple, right? Like Tyler Bonnen, who's a\npostdoc who's collaborating with me, he actually studied a lot of computer vision at Stanford. And so one of the things he was\ninterested in is some people who have brain damage\nin areas of the brain that were thought to be\nimportant for memory, but they also seemed to have\nsome perception problems with particular kinds\nof object perception. And this is super controversial and some people found\nthis effect, some didn't. And he went back to computer vision and he said, \"Let's take\nthe best state of the art computer vision models and let's give them the same kinds of perception tests that we were giving to these people.\" And then he would find the images where the computer vision\nmodels would just struggle. And you would find that\nthey just didn't do well. Even if you add more\nparameters, you add more layers on and on and on, it doesn't help, right? The architecture didn't matter, it was just there, the problem. And then he found those\nwere the exact ones where these humans with particular damage to this area called the perineal cortex, that was where they were struggling. So somehow this brain area\nwas being, was important for being able to do these\nthings that were adversarial to these computer vision models. So then he found that it only happened if people had enough time they could make those discriminations,\nbut without enough time, if they just get a glance, they're just like the\ncomputer vision models. So then what he started to say was, \"Well maybe let's look at people's eyes.\" Right? So a computer vision\nmodel sees every pixel all at once, right? It's not, you know... And we don't, we never see\nevery pixel all at once. Even if I'm looking at\na screen with pixels, I'm not seeing every pixel at once. I'm grabbing little points on\nthe screen by moving my eyes around and getting a very\nhigh resolution picture of what I'm focusing on and kind of a lower resolution information about everything else. But I'm not necessarily choosing, but I'm directing that exploration. And allowing people to move their eyes and integrate that information\ngave them something that the computer vision\nmodels weren't able to do. So somehow integrating\ninformation across time and getting less information at each step gave you more out of the process. - I mean the process of\nallocating attention across time seems to be a really important process. Even the breakthroughs that you get with machine learning mostly\nhas to do with attention, is all you need is bot attention. Transformative bot attention. So attention is a really interesting one. - Yeah.\n- But then like, yeah, how you allocate\nthat attention, again, is like, is at the core\nof like what it means to be intelligent, what it\nmeans to process the world, integrate all the important things, discard all the unimportant things. Attention is at the core of\nit, it's probably at the core of memory too, because there's\nso much sensory information, there's so much going on,\nthere's so much going on, to filter it down to almost nothing and just keep those parts. And to keep those parts and\nthen whenever there's an error to adjust the model such that\nyou can allocate attention even better to new\nthings that would result, maybe maximize the chance\nof confirming the model or disconfirming the model that you have and adjusting it since then. Yeah, attention is a weird one. I was... I was always fascinated. I mean, I got a chance to\nstudy peripheral vision for a bit and indirectly\nstudied attention through that. And it's just fascinating\nhow humans, how good humans are at looking around and\ngathering information. - Yeah, at the same time people\nare terrible at detecting changes that can happen. - Yes.\n- In the environment. - Yes.\n- If they're not attending in the right way, if their predictive model\nis too strong, you know. So you have these weird things where like the machines can\ndo better than the people. It's not that it's like... You know, so this is\nthe thing is people go, \"Oh, the machines can do this stuff that's just like humans.\" It's like, well the machines\nmake different kinds of mistakes than the people do. And I will never be convinced, unless I... That, you know, we've replicated human... I don't even like the term intelligence 'cause I think it's a stupid concept, but it's like I don't think\nwe've replicated human intelligence unless I\nknow that the simulator is making exactly the same kinds\nof mistakes that people do. Because people make\ncharacteristic mistakes, they have characteristic biases, they have characteristic\nlike, you know, heuristics that we use and those I\nhave yet to see evidence that ChatGPT will do that. - Since we're talking about attention, is there an interesting connection to you between ADHD and memory? - Well it's interesting for\nme because when I was a child I was actually told... My school, I don't know if it came from a school psychologist, they\ndid do some testing on me, I know, for like IQ and stuff like that. Or if it just came from\nteachers who hated me. But they told my parents that I had ADHD. And so this was of\ncourse in the seventies. So basically they said like,\n\"You know, he has poor motor control and he's got ADHD.\" And so... And, you know, there were social issues. So like I could have been\nput a year ahead in school but then they said, \"Oh, but he doesn't have\nthe social intelligence. He doesn't have the social capabilities.\" - [Lex] Right. - So I still ended up being\nlike, you know, an outcast even in my own grade. But then like... So then my parents said, okay,\nwell they got me on a diet free of artificial colors and flavors, because that was the thing that people talked about back then. So I'm interested this topic because I've come to appreciate now that I have many of the characteristics, if not, you know, full blown. It's like I'm definitely\ntime blindness, rejection... I mean, you name it they talk about it. It's like impulsive behavior. I can tell you about all sorts\nof fights I've gotten into in the past. Just you name it. But yeah, so ADHD is fascinating though because right now we're seeing like more and more diagnosis of it and I don't know what to say about that. I don't know how much of that is based on kind of inappropriate expectations, especially for children, and\nhow much of that is based on true kind of like\nmaladaptive kinds of tendencies. But what we do know is this,\nis that ADHD is associated with differences in prefrontal function so that attention can be both more, you're more distractible,\nyou have harder time focusing your attention on what's relevant, and so you shift too easily. But then once you get on something that you're interested\nin, you can get stuck. And so, you know, the attention\nis this beautiful balance of being able to focus\nwhen you need to focus and shift when you need to shift. And so it's that flexibility\nplus stability again. And that balance seems\nto be disrupted in ADHD. And so, as a result, memory\ntends to be poor in ADHD, but it's not necessarily because there's a\ntraditional memory problem, but it's more because of\nthis attentional issue. Right? And so... And people with ADHD often\nwill have great memory for the things that they're interested in and just no memory for the things that\nthey're not interested in. - Is there advice from your\nown life on how to learn and succeed from that? From just how the\ncharacteristics of your own brain with ADHD and so on, how do you learn, how do you remember information? How do you flourish in this\nsort of education context? - I'm still trying to figure\nout the flourishing per se, but education, I mean, being in science is enormously enabling of ADHD. It's like you're constantly\nlooking for new things, you're constantly seeking\nthat dopamine hit. And that's great, you know. And they tolerate you're\nbeing late for things. Nothing is really, nobody's\ngonna die if you screw up. You know, it's just nice. It's not like being a doctor or something where you have to be like much\nmore responsible and focused. You can just freely follow your curiosity, which is just great. But what I'd say is, is\nthat like I'm learning now about so many things, like\nabout how to structure my activities more and basically say, \"Okay, if I'm going to be...\" Email's like the big one\nthat kills me right now, I'm just constantly like\nshifting between email and my activities. And what happens is, is that I\ndon't actually get the email. I just look at my email and I get stressed 'cause I'm like, \"Oh, I\nhave to think about this. Let me get back to it.\" And I go back to something else. And so I've just got fragmentary\nmemories of everything. Right? So what I'm trying to\ndo is set aside a time where like this is my email time, this is my, you know, writing time, this is my goofing off time, and so blocking these things off. Give yourself the goofing off time. Sometimes I do that. And sometimes I have to be flexible and go like, \"Okay, I'm\ndefinitely not focusing. I'm going to give myself the downtime.\" And it's an investment,\nit's not like wasting time. It's an investment in\nmy attention later on. - And I'm very much with\nCal Newport on this, he wrote \"Deep Work,\" and a\nlot of other amazing books. He talks about task switching\nas a sort of the thing that really destroys productivity. So like, you know, switching... Well it doesn't even\nmatter from what to what, but checking social media,\nchecking email, maybe switching to a phone call and then doing\nwork and then switching... Even switching between if\nyou're reading a paper, switching from paper to paper to paper. - Yeah.\n- Because like curiosity and whatever the dopamine hit\nfrom the attention switch, like limiting that 'cause\notherwise your brain is just not capable to\nreally like load it in and really do that deep\ndeliberation I think that's required to remember things and to\nreally think through things. - Yeah, I mean, you probably\nsee this, I imagine, in AI conferences, but definitely in\nneuroscience conferences, it's now the norm that\npeople have their laptops out during talks and, you know,\nconceivably they're writing, you know, they're writing notes. But in fact, what often\nhappens if you look at people, and we can speak from a little\nbit of personal experience, is you're checking\nemail and you're like... Or I'm working on my own talk. But often it's like, you're doing things that are not paying... And I have this illusion,\n\"Well, I'm paying attention.\" And then I'm going back. And then what happens is\nI don't remember anything from that day, it just kind of vanished. Because what happens is I'm creating all these artificial event boundaries. I'm losing all this executive function. Every time I switch, I'm getting\nlike a few seconds slower and I'm catching up mentally\nto what's happening. And so instead of being in a model where you're meaningfully\nintegrating everything and predicting and generating\nthis kind of like rich model, I'm just catching up. You know? And so yeah, there's great\nresearch by Molina Uncapher and Anthony Wagner on multitasking, that people can look up,\nthat talks about just how bad it is for memory and,\nyou know, it's becoming worse and worse of a problem. - So you're a musician, take me through how'd you get into music? Like what made you first\nfall in love with music, with creating music? - I, yeah, so I started playing\nmusic just when I was like doing trumpet in school for school band and I would just read music and play. And, you know, I was pretty decent at it. Not great, but I was decent. - How'd you go from trumpet to- - Guitar?\n- To guitar? Especially the kind of music you're into? - Yeah, so basically in high school... Yeah, so I kind of was\na late bloomer to music, but just kind of MTV grew up with me. I grew up with MTV and so\nthen you started seeing all this stuff and then I got into... Metal was kind of like my early genre and I always reacted to\njust things that were loud and had a beat like... I mean, ADHD, right? It's like, you know,\neverything from \"Sgt. Peppers\" by The Beatles to like \"Led\nZeppelin II,\" my dad had. My parents had both those albums, so I'd listen to them a lot. And then like The Police,\n\"Ghost in the Machine.\" But then I got into metal Def Leppard and, you know, AC/DC, Metallica, went way down the rabbit\nhole of speed metal. And that time was kind of like, \"Oh, like why don't I play guitar? I can do this.\" And I had friends who were doing that and I just never got it. Like I was, I took lessons\nand stuff like that, but it was different because\nwhen I was doing trumpet I was reading sheet music and this was like, I\nwas learning by looking. There's a thing called\ntablature, you know this, where it's like you see like\na drawing of the fretboard with numbers and that's where\nyou're supposed to put your... It's kinda like paint by numbers, right? And so I learned it in a\ncompletely different way, but I was still terrible\nat it and I didn't get it. It's actually taken me a long time to understand exactly what the issue was. But it wasn't until I really got into punk and I saw bands, like I saw Sonic Youth, I remember especially,\nand it just blew my mind because they violated the\nrules of what I thought music was supposed to be. I was like, \"This doesn't sound right, these are not power chords, and this doesn't just\nhave like a shouty verse and then a chorus part. It's not going back. This is just like weird.\" And then it occurred to me,\nyou don't have to write music the way people tell you\nit's supposed to sound. That just opened up everything for me. And I was playing in a band and I was struggling with writing music because I would try to write like, you know, whatever\nwas popular at the time, or whatever sounded like other bands that I was listening to. And somehow I kind of\nmorphed into just like, just grabbing a guitar\nand just doing stuff. And I realized a part of\nmy problem with doing music before was I didn't enjoy\ntrying to play stuff that other people played. I just enjoyed music\njust dripping out of me and just, you know, spilling\nout and just doing stuff. And so then I started to say, \"What if I don't play a chord? What if I just play like notes\nthat shouldn't go together and just mess around with stuff?\" Then I said, \"Well what if\nI don't do four beats going, nah, nah, nah, nah. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. What if I go one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five?\" And started messing around\nwith time signatures. Then I was playing in this\nband with a great musician who was really... Brent Ritzel, who was\nin this band with me, and he taught me about arranging songs. And it was like, \"What\nif we take this part and instead of make it\ngo like back and forth we make it like a circle, or what if we make it like\na straight line, you know, or a zigzag, you know, just\nmake it like non-linear in these interesting ways?\" And then the next thing you\nknow it's like the whole world sort of opens up as like the... And then what I started\nto realize, especially... So you could appreciate\nthis as a musician, I think, so time signatures, right? So we are so brainwashed to\nthink in four four, right? Every rock song you can think\nof almost is in four four. I know you're a Floyd fan, so think of \"Money\" by Pink Floyd, right? - [Lex] Yeah. (Charan vocalizing) - [Lex] Yeah. - You feel like it's in four four because it resolves itself, but it resolves on the last note of... Basically it resolves on the\nfirst note of the next measure. So it's got seven beats instead of eight where the riff is actually happening. - [Lex] Interesting. - But you're thinking in four, because that's how we're used thinking. So the music flows a little bit\nfaster than it's supposed to and you're getting a little\nbit of prediction error every time this is happening. And once I got used to that, I was like, \"I hate writing at four four.\" Because I was like,\n\"Everything just feels better if I do it in seven four, or if I alternate between four and three.\" And doing all this stuff. And then it's like you just... And, you know, jazz music is like that. You know, they just do so much\ninteresting stuff with this. - So playing with those\ntime signatures allows you to like really break\nit all open and just... I guess there's something\nabout that where it allows you to actually have fun. - Yeah, yeah. And it's like... So I'm actually like a very... One of the genres we used\nto play in was Math Rock, was what they called it. It was just like, this has so\nmany weird time signatures. - What is math... Oh, interesting. - [Charan] Yeah, so. - That's the math part of\nrock is what the mathematical disturbances of it, or what? - Yeah, I guess it would\nbe like, so instead of you might go like instead\nof playing four beats in every measure... (Charan vocalizing) You go... (Charan vocalizing) You know? And that's just do these things. And then you might\narrange it in weird ways so that there might be three measures of verse and then one, you know, and then five measures of\nchorus, and then two measures... So you could just mess\naround with everything. Right? - What does that feel like to listen to? There's something about\nsymmetry, or like patterns, that feel good and like\nrelaxing for us or whatever. It feels like home. And disturbing that can\nbe quite disturbing. - Yeah.\n- So is is that... Is that the feeling you\nwould have if you were keep messing with Math Rock? I mean, I- - Yeah, yeah.\n- That's stressing me out just listening. - Well, yeah, yeah.\n- Learning about it. - So, I mean, it depends. So a lot of my style of songwriting is very much like in terms\nof like repetitive themes, but messing around with structure. 'cause I'm not a great\nguitarist, technically, and so I don't play complicated stuff. And there's things that you can hear stuff where it's just like so\ncomplicated, you know? But often what I find is,\nis like having a melody and then adding some\ndissonance to it, just enough, and then adding some complexity that gets you going just enough. But I have a high tolerance for that kind of\ndissonance and prediction. I think, I have a theory, a pet theory, that it's like basically you can explain most of human behavior as\nsome people are lumpers and some people are splitters, you know? And so it's like some people are very kind of excited\nwhen they get this dissonance and they wanna like go\nwith it, and some people are just like, \"No, I wanna lump every...\" You know, I don't know, maybe\nthat's even a different thing, but it's like, basically it's like, I think some people get\nscared of that discomfort. - Yeah.\n- And I really- - Thrive on it.\n- Gravitate towards it. You know?\n- I love it. What's the name of your band now? - The cover band I play in is\na band called Pavlov's Dogz. And so... - Yeah. - So it's a band, unsurprisingly, of mostly memory\nresearchers, neuroscientists. - I love this. - And so-\n- I love this so much. - Yeah, actually one\nof your MIT colleagues, Earl Miller plays bass. - He plays bass? So you play... Like, do you play with him, or- - So you could compete if you want. Maybe we could audition you. - For audition. Oh, yeah. I'm coming for you, Earl. (Charan laughing) - Earl's gonna-\n- I'm coming for your spot. - Earl's gonna kill me. He is like very precise the way- - I'll play triangle or something. (Charan laughing) Or is it, a cowbell? Yeah, I'll be the cowbell guy. And you guys, what kind\nof songs do you guys do? - So it's mostly late seventies\npunk and eighties New Wave and post-punk Blondie, Ramones, Clash. I do, I sing \"Age of Consent\" by New Order and \"Love Will Tear Us Apart.\" - [Lex] And you said you\nhave a female singer now? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kari Hoffman and also Paula Croxson. And so they do, they do, yeah. So Kari does Blondie amazingly well and we do like \"Gigantic\" by the Pixies. Paula does that one. - Which song do you love to play the most? What kind of song is super fun for you? - Of someone else's? - Yeah, a cover. Yeah. - A cover? Okay, and it's one we\ndo with Pavlov's Dogz? - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - I really enjoy playing,\n\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\" by Iggy and The Stooges. - [Lex] Yeah, that's a good song. - Which is perfect 'cause\nwe're Pavlov's Dogz. - [Lex] Yeah. - And Pavlov of course was like, basically created learning theory. So, you know, there's that. But also it's like... But I mean Iggy and The\nStooges, that song, so I play and sing on it, but it's just like, it devolves into total noise and I just like fall on the\nfloor and generate feedback. I've like, I think in the last\nversion it might have been that or a Velvet Underground\ncover in our last show. I actually, I have a guitar\nmade of aluminum that I got made and I thought this thing's indestructible and so I kind of like was just,\nyou know, moving it around, had it upside down and all this\nstuff to generate feedback. And I think I broke one of the... I broke one of the tuning pegs and- - Oh, wow.\n- Yeah, so I managed... I managed a break an all metal guitar. Oof, go figure. - A bit of a big ridiculous\nquestion, but let me ask you, we've been talking about\nneuroscience in general. What do you... You've been studying the\nhuman mind for a long time. What do you love most\nabout the human mind? Like when you look at\nit, we look at the FMRI, just the scans and the behavioral stuff, the electrodes, you know,\nthe psychology aspect, reading the literature\non the biology side, neurobiology, all of it. When you look at it, what is\nmost like beautiful to you? - I think the most beautiful but incredibly hard to put your finger on is this idea of the internal model. That it's like there's everything you see and there's everything you hear,\ntouch, and taste, you know, every breath you take, whatever, but it's all connected\nby this like dark energy that's holding that whole universe of your mind together, right? And without that it's\njust a bunch of stuff. And somehow we put that together and it forms so much of our experience. And being able to figure\nout where that comes from and how things are connected\nto me is just amazing. But just this idea of like\nthat the world in front of us, we're only sampling this little bit and trying to take so\nmuch meaning from it. And we do a really good job. Not perfect, I mean, you know. But that ability to me is just amazing. - Yeah, it's an incredible\nmystery, all of it. It's funny you said dark energy 'cause the same in astrophysics,\nyou look out there, you look at dark matter and dark energy, which is this loose\nterm assigned to a thing we don't understand, which\nhelps make the equations work in terms of gravity and the\nexpansion of the universe, in the same way. It seems like there's that\nkind of thing in the human mind that we're like striving to understand. - Yeah, yeah. You know, it's funny\nthat you mentioned that. So one of the reasons I wrote the book, amongst many, is that I\nreally felt like people needed to hear from scientists. And like COVID was just\na great example of this, because like people weren't\nhearing from scientists. One of the things I think\nthat people didn't get was the uncertainty of science\nand how much we don't know. And I think every scientist lives in this world of uncertainty. And when I was writing the\nbook I just became aware of all of these things we don't know. And so I think of physics a lot and I think of this idea of\nlike overwhelming majority of the stuff that's in our universe cannot be directly measured. I used to think, \"Ha ha,\nI hate physics though.\" Physicists get the Nobel Prize for doing whatever stupid thing. It's like there's 10 physicists out there. I'm just kidding. Just-\n- Strong words. - Yeah, no, no, no, I'm kidding. It's just the physicists\nwho do neuroscience can be rather opinionated so sometimes I like to dish on that. - [Lex] It's all love. - It's all love, that's right. This is the ADHD talking. So... But at some point I had this\naha moment where I was like to be aware of that\nmuch that we don't know, and have a beat on it and\nbe able to go towards it, that's one of the biggest\nscientific successes that I could think of. You are aware that you don't know about this gigantic section, overwhelming majority\nof the universe, right? And I think the more what keeps me going to some extent is realizing\nthe changing the scope of the problem and figuring out, \"Oh my God, there's all\nthese things we don't know.\" And I thought I knew this, 'cause science is all\nabout assumptions, right? So have you ever read \"The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions\" by Thomas Kuhn? - Yes.\n- That's like my only philosophy really that I've read. But it's so brilliant in the\nway that they frame this idea of like, he frames this\nidea of assumptions being core to the scientific\nprocess, and the paradigm shift comes from changing those assumptions. And this idea of like finding\nout this kind of whole zone of what you don't know to me\nis the exciting part, you know? - Well you are a great scientist and you wrote an incredible book. So thank you for doing that. And thank you for talking today. You've decreased the amount\nof uncertainty I have, just a tiny little bit today, and revealed the beauty of memory. This was a fascinating conversation. Thank you for talking today. - Oh, thank you. This has been a blast. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Charan Ranganath. To support this podcast\nplease check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Haruki Murakami, \"Most\nthings are forgotten over time, even the war itself. The life and death struggle\npeople went through is now like something\nfrom the distant past. We're so caught up in our everyday lives that events of the past\nare no longer in orbit around our minds, there\nare just too many things we have to think about every day, too many new things we have to learn. But still, no matter how much time passes, no matter what takes place in the interim, there are some things we can\nnever assign to oblivion, memories we can never rub away. They remain with us\nforever, like a touchstone.\" Thank you for listening, and\nI hope to see you next time."
