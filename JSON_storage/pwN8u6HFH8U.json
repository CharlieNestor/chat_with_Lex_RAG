      "text": "- Where are we right now, Paul? - Lex, we are in the middle of nowhere. - [Lex] It's the Amazon jungle. There's vegetation, there's insects, there's all kinds of creatures. A million heartbeats, a million eyes. So really, where are we right now? - [Paul] We are in Peru, in a very remote part of\nthe Western Amazon basin. And because of the proximity of the (indistinct) cloud forest to the lowland tropical rainforest, we are in the most biodiverse\npart of planet Earth. There's more life per square\nacre, per square mile out here than there is anywhere else on Earth, not just now, but in the\nentire fossil record. - The following is a\nconversation with Paul Rosolie, his second time on the podcast. But this time we did the conversation\ndeep in the Amazon jungle. I traveled there to hang out with Paul and it turned out to be an\nadventure of a lifetime. I'll post a video capturing some aspects of that\nadventure in a week or so. It included everything from getting lost in dense, unexplored wilderness with no contact to the outside world, to taking very high doses of ayahuasca and much more. Paul, by the way, aside from being my good friend, is a naturalist, explorer, author, and is someone who has dedicated his life to protecting the rainforest. For this mission, he\nfounded Junglekeepers. You can help him if you\ngo to junglekeepers.org. This trip for me was life-changing. It expanded my understanding of myself and of the beautiful world\nI'm fortunate to exist in with all of you. So I'm glad I went and I'm glad I made it out alive. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Paul Rosolie."

      "text": "I can't believe we're actually here. - I can't believe you actually came. - And I can't believe you\nforced me to wear a suit. (Paul laughs) - That was the people's choice, trust me. - All right, we've been through quite a lot over the last few days. - We've been through a bit. - Let me ask you a ridiculous question. What of all the creatures right now if they wanted to, could cause us harm? - The thing is, the Amazon\nrainforest has been described as the greatest natural\nbattlefield on Earth because there's more life\nhere than anywhere else, which means that everything\nhere is fighting for survival. The trees are fighting for sunlight, the animals are fighting for prey. Everybody's fighting for survival. And so everything that you see here, everything around us\nwill be killed, eaten, digested, recycled at some point. The jungle is really just a\ngiant churning machine of death. And life is kind of this moment of stasis where you maintain this\ncollection of cells in a particular DNA sequence and then it gets digested\nagain and recycled back and renamed into everything. And so the things in this forest, while they don't want to hurt us, there are things that are heavily defended because, for instance,\na giant anteater needs claws to fight off a jaguar. A stingray needs a stinger on its tail, which is basically a serrated\nknife with venom on it to deter anything that\nwould hunt that stingray. Even the catfish have pectoral fins that have razor, long steak\nknife-sized defense systems. Then you have of course the jaguars, the harpy eagles, the piranha, the candiru fish that can swim up a penis, lodge themselves inside. It's the Amazon rainforest. The thing is, as you've learned this week, nothing here wants to get us, with the exception of maybe mosquitoes. Every other animal just wants to eat and exist in peace. That's it. - But there is, each of those\nanimals, like you described, have a kind of radius of defense. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- So if you accidentally step into its home. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Into that radius, it can cause harm. - Or make 'em feel threatened. - Make 'em feel threatened. There is a defense\nmechanism that is activated. - Some incredible defense mechanisms. I mean, you're talking about\n17-foot black caiman crocodiles that with significant size\nthat could rip you in half. Anacondas, the largest snake on Earth."

      "section": "Bushmaster snakes",
      "text": "Bushmasters that can grow up to be nine to I think even 11 feet long. And I've caught bushmasters\nthat are thicker than my arms. - So for people who don't\nknow bushmaster snakes, what are these things? - These are vipers. It's the, I believe it's\nthe largest viper on Earth. - Venomous?\n- Extremely venomous with hinged teeth, tissue-destroying venom. Like, if you get bitten by a bushmaster, they say you don't rush and try and save your own life. You try to savor what's around you. Look at, look around at the world, smoke your last cigarette,\ncall your mom, that's it. - So that moment of stasis that is life is going to end abruptly when you interact with one of those. - Yeah, I even have, even this seemingly. - Can I just pause at how\nincredibly beautiful it is that you could just reach to your right and grab a piece of the jungle. (Lex and Paul laugh) - It's like a, even this seemingly beautiful little fern, if you go this way on\nthe fern, you're fine. As soon as, ow, as soon\nas you go this way, there's invisible, little\nspikes on there if you wanna. - Oh, I see, I feel that. - Yeah, see that? It's like everything is defended. If you're driving on the road and you have your arm out the side, or if you're on a motorcycle\ngoing through the jungle and you get one of these, it'll just tear all the\nskin right off your body. It's kind of doing that to me now. - So what would you do? Like, we were going through\nthe dense jungle yesterday and you slide down the\nhill, your foot slips, you're sliding down.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - And then you find yourself staring a couple feet away from\na bushmaster snake. What are you doing? You're, for people who somehow don't know, are somebody who loves, admires snakes, who has met thousands of snakes, has worked with them, respects them, celebrates them. What would you do with a\nbushmaster snake face to face? - Face to face, this has happened, that I've been there. - It's nice. - I've come face to face with a bushmaster and there's two things, there's two reactions that you might get. One is if the bushmaster\ndecides that it's vacation time, if it's sleeping, if he just had a meal, they'll come to the edges of trails or beneath a tree and\nthey'll just circle up, little spiral, big spiral, big pile of snake on the trail\nand they'll just sit there. And one time there was a snake sitting on the side of a trail\nbeneath a tree for two weeks. This snake was just sitting there resting, digesting its food out\nin the open, in the rain, in the sun, in the night. Didn't matter, you go near it,\nbarely even cracked a tongue. Now the other option is\nthat you get a bushmaster that's alert and hunting and out looking for something to eat and they're ready to defend themselves. And so I once came across a bushmaster in the jungle at night, and this bushmaster turned\nits head towards me, looked at me and made it very clear, I'm gonna go this way. And so I did the natural thing that any snake enthusiast would do, and I grabbed its tail. Now, 11 feet later by the head, the snake turned around and just said if you wanna meet God, I\ncan arrange the meeting. I will oblige. And I decided to let the bushmaster go. And so it's like that with most animals. You know, a jaguar will\nturn and look at you and just remind you of how small you are. - Like, what did you\nsee in the snake's eyes? What, how did you sense\nthat this is not the right, this is not, this is gonna\nbe your end if you proceed? - His readiness. I wanted to get him by the tail and show him to the people that were there and maybe work with\nthe snake a little bit. As an 11-foot snake, he,\nthe snake turned around and made it very clear,\nlike not today, pal. It's not gonna happen. - It was in the eyes and the movement and the tension of the body? - It was the movement. It was the movement and the S of the neck. It was as if you pushed me and I went, \"Let's go, make my day.\"\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Like, he just looked a little bit too. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Too ready. (Lex laughs) He's like, I love this. - [Lex] Okay, all right, so you know. - You just know, you just know. Whereas like the snake you met last night. - [Lex] Yeah, beautiful snake. - Such a calm little thing. He just focuses on eating baby lizards and little snails and things. And that snake has no\nconcept of defending itself. It has no way to defend itself. So even a, even something\nthe size of a blue jay could just come and just\npeck that thing in the head and swallow it. And it's a helpless, little snake. So it's really, it kind\nof depends on the animal. It depends on the mood you catch 'em in. Each one has a different temperament. - The grace of its movement was\nmesmerizing, curious almost. Maybe I'm anthropomorphizing,\nprojecting onto it, but it was.\n- The tongue flicking was a sign of curiosity. It was trying to figure\nout what was going on. It was like, why am I on\nthis treadmill of human skin, you know? They're just trying to\nget to the next thing. Trying to get hidden, trying\nto get away from the light. - Also, the texture of the\nscales is really fascinating. I mean, it's my first.\n- Oh, that's right. - The first snake I've ever\ntouched is so interesting. It was just such an incredible system of muscles that are all\ninteracting together to make that kind of movement work and all the texture of\nits skin, of its scales. What do you love about snakes? From my first experience with a snake to all the thousands of\nexperiences you had with snakes, what do you love about these creatures? - I think it's, when you\njust spoke about it it was, that's the first snake you've met. And it was a tiny, little\nsnake in the jungle and you spoke about it with\nso much light in your eyes. And I think that because\nwe've been programmed to be scared of snakes, there's something wondrous\nthat happens in our brain. Maybe it's just this joy of discovery, that there's nothing to be scared of. And whether it's a\nrattlesnake that is dangerous and that you need to give distance to, but you look at it from a\ndistance and you go, whoa. Or it's a harmless little grass snake that you can pick up and\nenjoy and give to a child. It's, they're just these\nstrange, legless animals that just exist. You know, they don't even have eyelids. They're so different than us. They have a tongue that senses the air and they, to me, are so beautiful. And I've my whole life been\ndefending snakes from humans. And it's, they seem misunderstood. I think they're incredibly beautiful. There's every color and variety of snakes. There's venomous snakes,\nthere's tree snakes, there's huge, crushing anacondas. It's just, of the 2,600 species of snakes that exist on Earth, there's just such beauty, such complexity and such simplicity. They're just, to me, I'm, I feel like I'm friend with snake and they rely on me to\nprotect them from my people. - Friend with snake. - Me friend snake. - Me friend snake. You said some of them\nare sometimes aggressive, some of them are peaceful. Is this a mood thing, a\npersonality thing, a species thing? Is it, what is it? - So the, as far as I know, there's only really two snakes on Earth that could be aggressive 'cause aggression indicates offense. And so a reticulated\npython has been documented as eating humans. Anacondas, although while\nit hasn't been publicized, they have eaten humans. Every single other snake from\nboa constrictor to bushmaster, to spitting cobra to grass snake to garter snake to everything else, every single other snake does\nnot want to interact with you. They have no interest. So there's no such thing\nas an aggressive snake once you get outside of\nanaconda and reticulated python. Aggression could be trying\nto eat you, that's predation. But for every other snake, a rattlesnake, if it was there, would either\ngo escape and hide itself, or it would rattle its tail\nand tell us don't come closer. A cobra will hood up and\nbegin to hiss and say, \"Don't approach me. I'm asking you nicely\nnot to mess with me.\" And most other snakes are\nfast or they stay in the trees or they're extremely camouflaged. But their whole MO is\njust don't bother me. I don't wanna be seen, I\ndon't wanna be messed with. In fact, all I wanna do is be left alone. And once in a while, I just want to eat. And by the way, when\nyou see a snake drink, your heart will break. It's like seeing, it's the only thing that's cuter than a puppy. Like, watching a snake\ntouch its mouth to water and just, you just see\nthat little mouth going as they suck water in. And it's like, it's just so adorable, watching this scaled animal\njust be like, I need water. - In a state of vulnerability. - [Paul] Yeah, yeah.\n- Bro, there's nothing cuter than a little puppy with a tongue like. (Lex slurps tongue) - Baby ball python.\n- [Lex] Right. - Baby king cobra, man, come on. - I'll have to take your word for it. (Lex laughs) - [Paul] Baby elephant. - So what are, they're like at a puddle\nand they just take it in? - They can be at a puddle\nand they just take it in. Or one time in India, I\nwas with a snake rescuer and we found this nine-foot king cobra, this god of a snake. They're Ophiophagus hannah\nis their Latin name, and they're snake eaters. They're the king of the snakes,\nthe largest venomous snake. And the people that\ncalled the snake rescuer, 'cause that's a profession in India, you know, it had gotten into their kitchen or their backyard. And so we showed up and we got the snake. And the snake rescuer, he knew, he looked at the snake and\nhe went to me, he said, \"You know, why do you think\nthis snake would go in a house?\" And he was quizzing me. And I actually went,\n\"You know, I don't know, is it warm, is it cold?\" You know, like sometimes\ncats like to go into the warm cars in the winter. And he was like, \"He's thirsty.\" He goes, \"Watch this.\" He took a water bottle,\npoured it over the, now the snake is standing up. The snake stands up three feet tall. This is a huge king cobra with a hood, terrifying snake to be around. He leans over to the snake and the snake is standing\nthere trusting him. And he takes a water bottle and pours it onto the snake's nose. And the snake turns up its nose and just starts drinking\nfrom the water bottle. Human giving water to\nsnake, big, scary snake. But this human understood\nsnake gets water, snake gets released in\njungle, everybody's okay. - So sometimes the needs are simple, they just don't have the words to communicate them to us humans. - Yeah. - And is it disinterest or is it fear, almost like they don't notice us? Or is it we're a source, the unknown aspect of it, the uncertainty is a source of danger? - Well, animals live in a\nconstant state of danger. Like if you look at that\ndeer that we saw last night, it's stalking through the jungle, wondering what's going to eat it, Wondering if this is the last\nmoment it's gonna be alive. It's like animals are\nconstantly terrified of that this is their last moment. - Yeah, just for the listener, we're walking through\nthe jungle late at night, so it's darkness except our headlamps on. And then all of a sudden, Paul stops. He's like, \"Shh,\" and he looks in the distance\nand he sees two eyes. He's, I think you thought is that a jaguar or is that a deer? And it was moving its head like this, like scared or maybe trying to figure it, trying to localize itself,\ntrying to figure out. - Trying to see around you. - You're doing the same to it, the two of you like moving your head. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And like deep into the jungle, like, I don't know. It's pretty far away through the trees you could still see it. It was fascinating.\n- 30 feet or so, yeah. - That's the thing to actually mention. I mean the, with headlamp you see the reflection in their eyes. It's kind of incredible.\n- [Paul] Yes. - Just to see a creature, to try to identify a creature by just the reflection from its eyes. - Yeah, and so the cats, sometimes you'll get like\na greenish or a bluish glow from the cats. The deer are usually white to orange, caiman, orange, nightjars, orange, snakes can usually be like orange, moths, spiders sparkle. And so you have all these different, as you walk through the jungle, you can see all these different eyes. And when something large looks\nat you like that deer did, your first thing is what animal is this that I am staring back at? 'Cause through the light you kind of get, you see the reflection off the\nbright light off the leaves. And I couldn't tell at\nfirst 'cause I actually, the, those big, bright eyes,\nit could have been an ocelot, it could have been a jaguar,\nit could have been a deer. And then when it did this movement, that's what the cats do. They try to see around your light. I thought maybe Lex Fridman's\nhere, we're gonna get lucky. It's gonna be a jag right off trail. - Your definition of lucky\nis a complicated one. - Yeah.\n- That's a fascinating process when you see those two eyes\ntry to figure out what it is. And it is trying to figure out\nwhat you are in that process."

      "section": "Black caiman",
      "text": "Let's talk about caiman.\n- [Paul] Sure. - We've seen a lot of\ndifferent kinds of size. We've seen a baby one, a bigger one. Tell me about these\n16-foot plus apex predators of the Amazon rainforest. - The big, bad, black caiman, which is the largest reptilian\npredator in the Amazon except for the anaconda, they kind of both share\nthat notch of apex predator. They were actually hunted\nto endangered species level in the '70s 'cause their leather, black, scale leather. But they're coming back. They're coming back and they're huge and they're beautiful. And I was walking near a\nlake and I never understood how big they could get\nexcept for I was walking near a lake last year and\nI was following the stream, you know, and it's like\nwhen you're following a little stream and there's\njust a little trickle of water, and all of a sudden this\nriver otter had been running the other direction on\nthe tree, on the stream. River otter comes up to\nme and I swear to God, this animal looked at me and went, \"Hey.\" And I went, \"Hey.\" He was like, didn't\nexpect to see me there. And he turned around, he\nlike did a little spin, started running down the stream. Then he turned around\nand he, you could tell, he was like, \"Let's go.\" And I, you know, I'm not\nanthropomorphizing here. The animal was asking me to come with him. So I followed the river\notter down the stream. We started running down the stream and the river otter looks\nat me one more time, is like, \"Yo\", jumps into the lake. And I'm like, what does he want me to see? Now in the lake, this\nriver otter is doing dives and freaking out and going\nup and down and up and down and they're very excited. They're screaming, they're screeching. All of a sudden, and I've\nnever seen anything like this except for in like \"Game of Thrones\", this croc head comes\nflying out of the water. All of the river otters were attacking this huge, black caiman, 16 feet. - [Lex] Wow.\n- Head half the size of this table. And she was thrashing her tail around, creating these huge waves in the water, trying to catch an otter,\nand they're so fast. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- That they were zipping around her, biting\nher and then going around. And this otter, swear\nto God, interspecies, looked at me and went, \"Watch this.\" (Lex laughs) We're fucking with this caiman. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It was amazing. And I, for the first time, I got to stand there\nwatching this incredible interspecies fight happening. They weren't trying to kill the caiman, they were just trying to mess with it. And the caiman was doing his best to try and kill these otters. And they were just having a good time in that sick, sort of\nhyper-intelligent animal, like wolf sort of way\nwhere they were just going, you can't catch us. - Yeah, like intelligence and agility versus like raw power and dominance. I mean, I got to handle\nsome smaller caiman and just the power they had. You know, you scale that up to imagine what a 16-foot, even a 10-foot, any kind of black caiman, the kind of power they deliver. Maybe can you talk to that? Like, the power they can\ngenerate with their tail, with their neck, with their jaw. - Yeah, alligators and\ncaiman and crocodiles have some of the strongest\nbite forces on Earth. Think a saltwater crocodile wins as the strongest bite force on Earth. And you got to hold about a foot, was it a four-foot spectacled caiman? And you got to feel, I mean, you're a black belt in jiu-jitsu. How do you compare the\nexplosive force you felt from that animal compared to\nwhat a human can generate? - It's difficult to describe in words. There's a lot of power. And we're talking about\nthe power of the neck, like the, what is it? I mean, there's a lot. It could generate power\nall up and down the body. So probably the tail is a monster, but just the neck and, you know, not to mention the\npower of the bite, that, and the speed too. Because the thing I saw\nand got to experience is how still and calm, at least from my amateur perspective. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- It seems calm, still. And then from that sort of\nzero to 60 could just go wild. - Just thrashing. - And then there's also\na decision it makes in that split second\nwhether, as it thrashes, is it going to kinda bite\nyou on the way or not? - Hmm and that's where, that's where of the four species of caiman that we have here, you see differences in their\npersonalities as a species. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And so you can like, just like you know like generally, Golden Retrievers are viewed\nas a friendly dog, generally. Not every single one\nof them, but as a rule. Spectacled caiman, puppies. You released one in the\nriver and it did nothing. It didn't bite one of your\nfingers, it just swam away. We dropped one in the\nriver and what did it do? It chose peace. Now I had a smooth-fronted\ncaiman a few weeks ago, and this was probably about\na three and a half footer. Not big enough to kill you, but very much big enough\nto grab one of your fingers and just shake it off your body, just death roll it right off. And as I was being careful, totally different caiman than\nthe one that you got to see. This one has spikes coming off it. They're like leftover dinosaurs. It's like they evolved\nduring the dinosaur times and never changed. They have spikes and bony plates and all kinds of strange\ngrowths that you don't see on the other, smoother caiman. And I tried to release this\none without getting bitten and I threw it into the\nstream, gently into the water, just went wow and tried\nto pull my hands back. And as I pulled my hand back, this caiman in the air turned around and just tried to gimme one parting blow and just got one tooth, whack, right to the bone of my finger. And bone injury feels\ndifferent than a skin injury. So you instantly, and\nit just reminds you of, that's a caiman with a head this big. And it hurt. And I know that it could\nhave taken off my finger. Now if you scale that\nup to a black caiman, it's rib crushing. It's zebra head-removing size, you know? Just meat destroying. It's nature's metal sort of, you know, just raw power. - So what's the biggest croc\nyou've been able to handle? - We were doing caiman surveys for years and we would go out at night\nand you want to figure out what are the populations of\nblack caiman, spectacled caiman, smooth-fronted caiman, dwarf caiman. And the only way to see which\ncaiman you're dealing with is to catch it 'cause a lot of times, you get up close with the light and you can see the eyes at night, but you can't quite\nsee what species it is. For instance, this past\nfew months we found two baby black caiman on the river, which is unprecedented here. We haven't seen that in decades. So it's important that we\nmonitor our croc population. So I started catching small ones. In \"Mother of God\", I\nwrite about the first one that me and JJ caught together, which was probably a little\nbigger than this table. And probably mid-20s\nbravado and competition with other young males of my species led to me trying to go as big as I could. And I jumped on a spectacled caiman that was slightly longer than I am. And I'm 5'9\", so I jumped on this probably six foot croc\nand quickly realized that my hands couldn't get around its neck and my legs were wrapped\naround the base of its tail. And the thrash was so intense\nthat as it took me one side, I barely had enough time to\nrealize what was happening before it beat me against the ground. My headlamp came off, so now I'm blind, in the dark, laying in a river in\nthe Amazon rainforest, hugging a six-foot crocodile. And I went, \"JJ\". (Lex laughs) As I always do. But I, in that moment,\nbefore I even let go, I knew I couldn't let go of the croc because if I let go of the croc, I thought she was gonna destroy my face. So I said, \"Okay, now I'm stuck here. If I just stay here, I can't release her. I need help.\" But I was like, I'm never\never, ever, ever gonna try and solo catch a croc this big again. I was like, this is, I knew\nin that moment I was like, this is good enough. - So anything longer than you. - [Paul] No.\n- You don't control the tail. You don't have, you have barely\ncontrol of anything, really. - Yeah, and that's a spectacled caiman. A black caiman is a whole\nother order of magnitude there. It's like saying like, oh, you know, I was play fighting\nwith my Golden Retriever versus I was play fighting\nwith like, you know, what's the biggest, scariest\ndog you could think of? The dog from Sandlot, a\ngiant, gorilla dog thing. Like a Malamute something, something huge. What do they call, Mastiffs? - Yeah, Mastiffs.\n- [Paul] Mastiffs. - I mean, you mentioned dinosaurs. What do you admire about black caiman? What, they've been here\nfor a very, very long time. There's something prehistoric\nabout their appearance, about their way of being, about their presence in this jungle. - With crocodiles, you're\nlooking at this mega survivor. They're in a class with sharks where it's like they've been here so long. When you talk about multiple extinctions, you talk about the Sixth Extinction, Earth's going through all this stuff. The crocodiles and the cockroaches\nhave seen it all before. They're like, man, we remember\nwhat that comet looked like. And they're not impressed. - Yeah, they have this,\nthey carry this wisdom. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- In their power. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- In the simplicity of their power, they carry the wisdom. - Yeah, and they're just\nsitting there in the streams and they don't care. And even if there's a nuclear holocaust, you know that there would just\nbe some crocs sitting there, dead-eyed in that stagnant water waiting for the life to regenerate\nso they could eat again. - It's gonna be the remaining humans versus the crocs and the cockroaches. And the cockroaches are\njust background noise. - Yeah, they'll always be there. Sons of bitches. - You know, we're talking\nabout individual black caiman and caiman and different species of caiman but whenever they're together\nand you see multiple eyes, which I've gotten to experience, it's quite a feeling. There's just multiple\neyes looking back at you. - [Paul] Mm-hmm. - Of course, for you that's immediate excitement. You immediately go towards that. You wanna see it, you want to explore it, maybe catch them, analyze\nwhat the species is, all that kind of stuff. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- What's, can you just describe that feeling when they're together and\nthey're looking at you? So head above water, eyes\nreflecting the light. - Yeah, so the other night Lex and I were in the river with JJ\nsurviving a thunderstorm. We're in the rain and we had covered our equipment with our boats. And the only thing that we could do was get in the river to keep ourselves dry. And so we were in the river\nat night, in the dark, no stars, just a little\nbit of canopy silhouetted with all this rain coming down. It was such a din you\ncould hardly hear anything. And all the way down river, I just see this caiman\neye in my headlamp light. And I started walking towards\nit because I was like, this is even better. We can catch a caiman while\nwe're in this thunderstorm in the Amazon River. And when JJ went, \"Paul, it's too far.\" JJ very rarely, very rarely, like he'll make a suggestion. Like, he'll usually go\nlike, \"Maybe it's far.\" (Lex laughs) But in that situation,\ndeep in the wilderness, unknown caiman size, he went, \"Paul, it's too far. Don't leave the three of us right now.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- We were too far out to take risks. We're too far out to be walking along the river bed at night. Because then, you know, right\nhere at the research station, if you step on a stingray, you get evaced. Out where we went, nothing. So for me, seeing those eyes, I think I've become so comfortable with so many of these animals\nthat I may have crossed into the territory where I feel so comfortable with many of these animals that they just don't worry me anymore. I mean, you were, I\nlooked at you in a raft while you had a sizable, probably about 12-foot black\ncaiman right next to your raft. I watched its head go under. - Bubbles, bubbles.\n- The bubbles. It was all coming up\nright next to your raft as he was just moving along\nthe bottom of the river 'cause he looked at me, went under, and then my raft passed\nand yours came over him. So now I'm looking back and your raft is going over this black\ncaiman and I'm going, I'm not worried at all. I was not worried. I was not worried that the\ncaiman would freak out. I was not worried that he\nwould try to attack you. I knew 100% that caiman\njust wanted us to go so he could go back to eating fish. - [Lex[ Yeah.\n- That's it. - Man, it's humbling. It's humbling, these giant creatures. And especially at night,\nlike you were talking about. And for me it's both\nscary and just beautiful when the head goes under. - Hmm.\n- Because like underwater, it's their domain so anything can happen. So what is it doing that\nits head is going under? It could be bored, it could be hungry, looking for some fish. It could be maybe wanting to come closer to you to investigate. Maybe you have some food around you. Maybe it's an old friend of\nyours and just wants to say hi. I don't know. - I have a few on the river, old friends.\n- [Lex] Okay. - No, when we see their\nheads go under, it's just, they're just getting outta the way. We're shining a light at\nthem and they're going why is there a light at night? I'm uncomfortable, head under. So these caiman, again, you think of it as this\nbig, aggressive animal, but I don't know anybody that's\nbeen eaten by a black caiman and the smaller species,\nsmooth-fronted caiman, dwarf caiman, spectacled caiman, they're not gonna eat anybody. Again, at the worst, if\nyou were doing something inappropriate with a caiman, like you jumped on it and\nwere trying to do research and it bit your hand, it\ncould take your hand off. But that's the only time. I've been walking down the river and stepped on a caiman and\nthe caiman just swims away. And so in my mind, caiman are just these, they're peaceful dragons that\nsit on the side of the river. And so to me, they are my friends and I worry about them\nbecause two months ago we were coming upriver and on one of the beaches was a beautiful, about five-foot black caiman\nwith a big machete cut right through the head. The whole caiman was\nwasted, nothing was eaten, but the caiman was dead. - What do you think that was? - Curious humans. - [Lex] Just committing violence? - Yeah, just loggers, people who aren't from\nthis part of the Amazon because a local person\nwould either eat the animal or not mess with it. Like, Pico would never\nkill a caiman for no reason because it doesn't make any sense. So these are clearly people\nwho aren't from the region, which usually means loggers 'cause they've come from somewhere else. They're doing a job here\nand they're just cleaning their pots in the river at night and they see eyes come near them because the caiman probably smells fish. And then they just whack\n'cause they want to see it. And they're just curious\nmonkeys on a beach. And again, me friend of\ncaiman, I protect from my type. - That said, you know,\nyou protect your friends and you analyze and study your friends. But sometimes friends can have\na bit of a misunderstanding. And if you have a bit\nof a misunderstanding with a black caiman, I feel like just a bit of a\nmisunderstanding could lead to a bone crushing situation. - But not for a little, five-foot caiman. And I think that's\nincredibly speciesist of you. (Paul laughs) - Of all humans or all caiman? - No, like all my friends\ndo the same thing. They go, \"You swim in\nthe Amazon rainforest?\" You know, \"You swim in that river?\" And I go, \"Yes, every day.\" We, you know, back flips into the river. We've been swimming in\nthe river how many times with the piranha and the stingray and the candiru and the\ncaiman and the anacondas, all of it in the river with us. And we just do it. And what's that for you? So what allows you to doing that, knowing and having researched\nall the different things that can kill you? Which I feel like most\nof them are in the river. What allows you to just\nget in there with us? - Well, I think it's something about you, where you become like\nthis portal through which it's possible to see nature as not threatening but beautiful. And so in that you kinda naturally, by hanging out with you, I get to see the beauty of it. There is danger out there, but the dangerous part of it, just like the, there's a\nlot of danger in the city. There's danger in life, there's a lot of ways to get\nhurt emotionally, physically. There's a lot of ways to die\nin the stupidest of ways. We went on an expedition\nthrough the forest, just twisting your ankle,\nbreaking your foot, getting a bite from a\nthing that gets infected. It's, there's a lot of\nways to die and get hurt in the stupidest of ways in a nondramatic, caiman\neating you alive kind of way. - Yeah, it strikes me as\nunfair because humans, we're still in our minds so programmed to worry about that predator. That predator, that predator. What predator? We've killed everything. Black caimans are coming off\nthe endangered species list. We exterminated wolves from North America. I actually heard a suburban\nlady one time tell her son, \"Watch out, foxes will get you.\" Foxes.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They eat baby rabbits and mice. - Well, in the case of apex predators, I think when people say dangerous animals, they really are talking about\njust the power of the animal. And the black caiman have a lot of power. - A lot of power. - [Lex] And it's almost\njust a way to celebrate the power of the animal. - Sure, and if it's in celebration, then I'm all for it because\nmy God is that power, like the waves of fury that you saw. Like when that tail, I mean\nyou saw, you saw the tail, the spectacled, that\nperfect, amazing thing with all those interlocking\nscales that works. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So it's like a perfect creation of engineering. And then when you have\none that's this thick and all of a sudden that thing is moving with all the acceleration of that power, the volume of water, the sound that comes outta their throat. They're such, they're dragons. - We talked about the scales\nof the snake with like, the caiman, just the way it felt. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Was incredible. Just the armor, the\ntexture of it was so cool. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- I don't know, like the bottom one came and\nhas a certain kind of texture and it just all feels like power but also all feels like\ndesigned really well. It's like exploring through touch, like a World War II tank or\nsomething like that, just. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- It's the engineering that went into this thing. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- That like the mechanism of evolution\nthat created a thing that could survive for such a long time. It's just, like, incredible. This is a work of art. The, you know, the defense\nmechanisms, the power of it, the damage it can do, how effective it is as a hunter. All of that, all you could feel\nthat in just by touching it. - Do you ever see the mashup\nwhere they put side by side the image of, I think\nit's a falcon in flight next to a stealth bomber and they're almost the exact same design. It's incredible, like that. - What's the equivalent for a croc? (Lex and Paul laugh) - Like you said, maybe a tank. - [Lex] Maybe a tank.\n- More like armadillo, turtle. - [Lex] Yeah, like hippos.\n- I dunno. Yeah, there may not be a machine, a war machine equivalent of a crocodile. It would have to have like a big jaw element to it. - In the water, I mean we\ntalked also about hippos."

      "text": "Those are interesting creatures from all the way across\nthe world, just monsters. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Hippos and rhinos. Hippos are bigger usually,\nor rhinos are bigger? - Rhinos. Rhinos is the, after\nelephants is the largest. White rhinos. - They can be terrifying too. Again, when you step into the defense. - Absolutely, but I have to tell you, after being around so many rhinos. - You have friends,\nyou have friend rhinos? - I have rhino friends. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Black and white rhinos. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And they're all sweethearts. And I mean sweethearts. And I mean when you look at a rhino, it's like a living dinosaur. I know it's a mammal, but\nsomehow it's screams dinosaur 'cause it seems like Pleistocenic and from another age with the giant horn. And they're so much bigger than you think. Like, they're minivan sized animals. Like you're, we're not taller\nthan they are at the shoulder. And they have this strange shaped head and the huge horn and they sit\nthere eating grass all day. So if a rhino is dangerous to a human, it's because the rhino\nis going don't hurt me. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Don't hurt me. Don't hurt my baby. And then they're like, you know what? I'll just kill you, it'll be easier, 'cause you're scaring me right now. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You're too close to that rhino.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And so like there again,\nI just think it's funny 'cause humans were so quickly to go, \"Which snakes are aggressive?\" There are no aggressive snakes. You know, rhinos can be\ndangerous if provoked. Otherwise, they're peaceful,\nfat, grass unicorns, you know? Like, they're really pretty calm. - Yeah.\n- We had these incredible giant animals and the largest\nanimals on our planet, the black caiman, the\nrhinos, the elephants, all the big, beautiful stuff\nis becoming less and less. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And it almost reminds me like in \"Game of Thrones\",\nthey're like, yeah, they're, in the beginning they're like, yeah, there used to be dragons. And it was like this\nmemory and it's like, yeah, we used to have mammoths and we used to have Steller's sea cows that were 16-feet long, manatees. And it's, there were\nthings we used to have, the Caspian tiger that only\nwent extinct in the '90s, our lifetimes. And it's, that's mind-blowing to me. That has haunted me since I'm a child. I remember learning about\nextinction and I went wait, you're telling me that, I remember being a kid and going by the time I grew up\nyou're saying that I, gorillas could be gone,\nelephants could be gone, and because we're doing it? And then I just that, I remember, I remember looking at the\nnightlight being blurry 'cause I was crying. I was so upset and oh, and\nit was Lonesome George, that turtle, the Galapagos tortoise where there was one left and they said. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- If we just, if we just had a female, he could live. And I as a six, seven, eight\nyear old, that destroyed me. - We're all just trying to get laid, including that turtle. - Including that turtle\nfor a few hundred years. Dude. (Lex laughs) - So for young people out there, you think you are having trouble. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Think about that turtle. - Think about that turtle, yeah. You know, there's a turtle that Darwin and Steve Irwin both owned. - Yeah, yeah, I heard about that turtle. Man, they live a long time. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- They've seen things. - They've seen things that, there's a great like internet joke where they're like, they're\nlike accusing him of like being incongruous with modern times. They're like, he did\nnothing to stop slavery. He didn't fight in World War II. (Lex and Paul laugh) - Cancel the turtle. - Yeah, cancel the turtle. - Oh shit, what a world we live in."

      "section": "Anacondas",
      "text": "So it's interesting you mentioned\nblack caiman and anacondas are both apex predators. So it seems like the reason they can exist in similar environments\nis 'cause they feed on slightly different things. How is it possible for them to coexist? I read that anacondas can eat\ncaiman, but not black caiman. How often do they come in conflict? - So anacondas and caiman\noccupy the exact same niche and they're born at almost\nthe exact same size. And unlike most species, they don't have sort of a size range that they're confined to. They start at this big. Baby caiman are this big. Baby anacondas are a little longer, but they're thinner and\nthey don't have legs. So, it's the same thing in terms of mass. And they're all in the streams\nor at the edges of lakes or swamps. And so the baby anacondas\neat the baby caiman. Baby caiman can't really\ntake down an anaconda. They're going for little insects and fish. They have a quite a small mouth. So they, again, it's in\ntheir interest to hide from everything. A bird, a heron can eat a\nbaby caiman, pop it back. And so they have to survive but the anaconda and the caiman\nkind of joust as they grow. - Can you actually\nexplain how the anaconda would take down a caiman? Like, would it first use\nconstriction and then eat it? Or what's the methodology? - Yeah, so anacondas have\na kind of a, I don't know, like a three-point constriction system where their first thing is anchor. It's like jiu-jitsu. So the first thing is latch onto you. - I like how I'm writing\nthis down, like, all right. - [Paul] Yes.\n- This is jiu-jitsu like masterclass here. - This is for when you're\nwrestling an anaconda, just in case. (Paul and Lex laugh) - And you'll be like the coach\non the sidelines screaming. - You got it, Lex. (Lex laughs) Don't let him take the back. - Yeah.\n- All right, so one time me and JJ were following\na herd of collared peccary and JJ is teaching me tracking. So we're following, you\nknow, the hoof prints through the mud and we're doing this and I'm talking about no backpacks, just machetes, bare feet\nrunning through the jungle. And we come to this stream and JJ is like, \"I think we missed them. You know, I think they went.\" And I'm like, \"No, no,\nno, they went here, look.\" And not 'cause I'm a great tracker 'cause I can see, you know,\na few dozen footprints, hundreds of individual\nfootprints right there. And I'm going, \"No, no,\nthey just crossed here.\" And JJ was like, \"You know what? We're not gonna get eyes on 'em today.\" He was like, \"It's okay.\" He's like, \"We did good. We followed them for a long time.\" And I was like, \"Cool.\" And then I was trying to gauge like, can I drink this stream? And I see a culpa and a\nculpa is a salt deposit where animals come to feed 'cause sodium is a deficiency that most herbivores have here. And all of a sudden I just hear like the sound of a wet stick snapping, just that bone crunch. And I look down and there's\nabout a 16-foot anaconda wrapped around a freshly\nkilled peccary, wild boar. And what this anaconda\nhad done was as the, all the pigs were going across the stream, the anaconda had grabbed it by the jaw, swiped the legs, wrapped around it, bent it in half and then crushed its ribs. And that's what the anaconda do whether it's to mammals, to caiman, it's all the same thing. It's grab on, they have six\nrows of backwards-facing teeth. So once they hit you,\nthey're never gonna come off. You actually have to go\ndeeper in and then open before you can come out. All those backward-facing teeth, so they have an incredible anchor system and then they use their weight\nto pull you down to hell, to pull you down into that water, wrap around you and\nthen start breaking you. And every breath you take, you go. (Paul gasps) And you, you're up against a barrier. And then when you, when you\nexhale, they go a little tighter and you're never gonna\nget that space back. Your lungs are never\ngoing to expand again. And I know this because\nI've been in that crush before JJ pulled me out of it. And so this pig, the\nanaconda had gotten it and as the pig was thrashing and the anaconda was wrapping around, it had bent it in half. And I just heard those vertebrae going. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And so for a caiman, it's the same thing. They just grab 'em, they wrap around it and then they have to crush\nit until there's no response. They'll wait an hour,\nthey'll wait a long time until there's no response from the animal. They'll overpower it,\nthen they'll reposition, probably yawn a little bit, open their jaw and then\nstart forcing that entire. Now here's the crazy thing, is that an anaconda has stomach\nacid capable of digesting an entire crocodile where\nnothing comes out the other side. And when you see how thick the bony plate of a crocodile skull is, that that can go in the mouth and nothing comes out the\nother side, that's insane. And so it always made me\nwonder on a chemistry level how you can have such\nincredible acid in the stomach that doesn't harm the anaconda itself. And someone said mucus, but it's. - But it's able to digest,\noh, it's some kind of mucus. Oh, the mucus.\n- [Paul] The mucus. - There's oh, interesting. There's levels of protection\nfrom the anaconda itself. But it seems like the anaconda\nis such a simple system as an organism. - [Paul] I know.\n- Like that simplicity, taken at scale, it could just do the, can swallow a caiman, digest it slowly. - I know, but my question\nwas how on Earth is it physically possible\nto have this hellish bile that can digest anything, even something as horrendous\nas a caiman scales and bones and all the\nhardest shit in nature and then not hurt the snake itself? And I had a chemist explain to me that it's probably some\nsort of mucus system that lines the stomach\nand neutralizes the acid and keeps it floating in there. But my god, that must be powerful stuff. - So what does it feel like, being crushed, choked by an anaconda? - You, when an anaconda\nis wrapped around you and you find yourself in\nthe shocking realization that these could be your\nlast moments breathing, you are confronted with the vast disparity in power, that there is so much\npower in these animals, so much crushing, deliberate, reptilian, ancient\npower that doesn't care. They're just trying to get you to stop. They just want you to stop ticking and there's nothing you can do. And there's, I find it very awe-inspiring when I encounter that kind of power. When you, even if it's\nthat you see, you know, you see a dog run, you know? You ever try to outrun a dog and they just zip by you and you go, wow. You know, or you see a horse\nkick and you go, oh my god, if that hoof hit anyone's head, it'd knock 'em three states over. And it's like there is muscular power that is so far that, like you said, that explosive, that we dream of doing it. Like imagine if like a\nMuay Thai kickboxer could harness that sort of\ncaiman power, that smash. And so it's just awe-inspiring. I think it's really, really\nimpressive what animals can do. And we're all, you know, we're all the same sort of\nmakeup for the most part. All the mammals, you know? We all have our skeletons look so similar. We all have like, you know, if you look at like a\nkangaroo's biceps and chest, it looks so much like a man's. And if same thing goes for a bear, or you ever see a naked chimp? - Have I?\n- There's like chimps with alopecia.\n- [Lex] Oh shit. - And so.\n- [Lex] Oh they're shredded. - It looks like a bodybuilder. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Like it's got cuts and huge, huge everything. Like it's got pecs and they\ngot that face that's just like, just let me in. - What, no.\n- Yeah, where's your wallet? - Yeah, do something. But yeah, but there's a, the specialization of a\nlifetime of doing damage to the world and using those muscles, it just makes you just\nthat much more powerful than most humans 'cause humans\nI guess have more brain, so they get lazy. They start puzzle\nsolving versus, you know, using the biceps directly. - Well, yes and no and I\nhave this question, okay. So I, you know, that whole\nyou are what you eat thing. Now we one time here had two chickens. Now, one of them was a wild chicken, like from the farm had\nwalked around its whole life finding insects, and the other chicken\nwas like factory raised. And so we cut the heads\noff of both of them, started getting ready to cook 'em. Now the factory-raised chicken was like a much higher percentage of fat, had less muscle on its body, was softer tissue, a lighter color. The farm-raised chicken had\ndarker, more sinewy muscles, less fat, was clearly\na better-made machine. And so my question is is that what's happening with us? You know, like if you go see a Sherpa who's been walking his whole\nlife and pulling, you know, and walking behind muskoxes\nand lifting things up mountains and breathing clean air\nand not being in the city versus someone that's just\nbeen chowing down at IHOP for 40 years and never\ngetting off the couch. Like, I imagine it's the same thing, that you become what you eat. - Yeah, I mean like you and I were like, half dead, running up a mountain. Meanwhile, there's a\ngrandma just like walking and she's been walking that road and she's just built different. - With her alpaca on her shoulders. - With a baby, she just, they're just built different when you apply your body in a\nphysical way your whole life. - Yeah, like you can't replicate that. Like, just like that chimp has those from constantly moving through the canopy, constantly using those arms. Just like if you ever, you know, if you see an Olympic\nathlete or you hug Rogan. - Exactly the same. - You just go, what? Why is there so much muscle here? (Paul and Lex laugh) - That's exactly what I feel\nlike when you give him a hug, this is definitely a chimp of some sort. (Paul laughs) How does that, just that the constriction\nof the anaconda, just the feeling of that, are they doing that based on instinct or is there some brain stuff going on? Like is this just like a basic\nprocedure that they're doing and they just really don't give a damn, they're not like thinking, \"Oh Paul, this is this kind of species, he would taste good,\" or is it just a mechanism\njust start activating and you can't stop it? - With an anaconda, I really\nthink it's the second one. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I do think that they're impressive and beautiful\nand incredibly arcane. I think they're a very simple system, a very ancient system. And I think that once\nyou hit predation mode, it's going down no matter what. This stupid mosquito, I'm going like this and every time he just\nflies around my hand, like I'm a big, slow giant, woo. And he just goes around my hand and then he goes back to the same spot. Like, and I'm like, no. And then he comes right\nback to the same spot. It's like, it's like\nhe's just going fuck you. - Well here's the question. If the mosquito is stupid\nand you can't catch it, what does that make you? - Stupid. Dude, I flicked a wasp\noff me the other day. It flew back like 12 feet\nand in the air, corrected, and then flew back at my face. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It made so many correct like calculations and corrections\nand decided to come back and let me know about it. And it was like. - And that wasp probably\nwent back to the nest, said \"Guess what happened today?\" - Yo, this bitch ass kid from\nBrooklyn tried to flick me and I showed him what's\nup, I had him running. - They had a good chuckle on that one. Yeah you actually mentioned to me just on the topic of\nanacondas that you've been participating in a lot of\nscientific work on the topic. So like really in everything\nyou've been doing here you are celebrating the animals, you're respecting the animals, you're protecting the animals, but you're also excited\nabout studying the animals and their environment. So you've, you're actually\na co-author on a paper, on a couple of papers. But one of them is on anacondas and studying green\nanaconda hunting patterns. What's that about? - So the lead authors of that paper, Pat Champagne and Carter\nPayne, friends of mine, and what we started noticing for me began at that story I told you where we were coming across the stream\nand we saw the anaconda had been positioned just below a culpa. And then other people began noticing that anaconda seem to always\nbe beneath these culpas where mammals were gonna be coming. And that contrasted with\nwhat we knew about anacondas. 'Cause what we understood about anacondas, that they're purely ambush predators and they don't pursue their prey. But what we began finding out here, and Pat led the process\nof amazing scientists. He worked with the Acadia\nUniversity for a long time, worked with us for a long time. And he was one of the\nfirst to put a transmitter in an anaconda right around here. And we were able to see their movements. And that's what these papers are showing, is that they actually\ndo pursue their prey. They do move up and down using the streams as corridors through the forest. They actually do pursue their prey. They actually do seek out food. So I mean, think about\nit, it's a giant anaconda. Obviously it's not, it\ncan't just sit in one spot. It has to put some work into it. And so they're using scent and\nthey're using communication to use the streams. So you could be walking in the forest in a very shallow stream and see a sizable anaconda looking for a meal. - So in the shallow stream it moves not just in the\nwater, but in the sand. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- So it's, it also likes to burrow a little bit? - They burrow quite a bit. And so these large snakes operate subterranean more than we think. - [Lex] Interesting.\n- Like there's times that you'll go with a tracker, you go with a telemetry set and it'll say. (Paul beeps) Like we will be over the snake, snake's underground. Snake has found either a recess under the sides of the stream, you saw it last night, where all the fish have their holes under the side of the stream. There was a six-foot dwarf\ncaiman right in the stream, right where we were standing. And he had his cave, he goes under there. They know, they have their system. - Yeah, we walked by it. - We walked by it and\nhe stuck his head out 'cause he thought we'd gone. And then we turned around and\nI just got a glimpse of him 'cause I was in the front of the line and he just went right back into his cave. You guys are not gonna touch me. And so yeah, with the anacondas,\nit's been really exciting. And in 2014, JJ and me and\nMohsin and Pat and Lee, we all, we ended up catching\nwhat at the time was the record for Eunectes murinus\nscientifically measured. It was 18 feet, six inches, 220 pounds, one of the largest female\nanacondas on record. And since that time, these guys have been continuing\nto study the species, continuing to just, again, just add a little bit by little bit\nto the knowledge we have of the species. And studying green anacondas\nin lowland tropical rainforest. You've seen how hard it is to move, to operate, to navigate\nin this environment. And so when you think of the\nfact that in order to learn anything about this species, you have to spend vast amounts\nof time first locating them and then finding out a\nway to keep tabs on them 'cause even if you get lucky enough to see an anaconda by\nthe edge of a stream, to be able to observe it over time, to learn its habits or to put\na radio transmitter on it, or to take any sort of\nvaluable information from the experience is almost impossible. And so a lot of the\nstuff that I wrote about in \"Mother of God\", us jumping on anacondas\nand trying to catch them, and at first it just seemed like something we were doing to\nlearn, to just try and see them. But it ended up being\nthat we were wildly trying to figure out methodology that would have scientific implications later on. Because now it's allowing\nus to try and find the largest anacondas. And people used to say there's no way there's 25 foot, 27 foot. Well, there's just that\nvideo of the guy swimming with the 20-foot anaconda. And so now as we keep going, I'm going, well, maybe\nthrough drone identification we could find where the\nlargest anacondas are sitting on top of floating vegetation. And even then, how do we restrain them so that we could measure them\nand prove this to the world? It's sort of a side quest, but. - So by doing these kinds of studies, you figure out how they\nmove about the world, what motivates them in\nterms of when they hunt, where they hide in the world as the size of the anaconda change. So all of that, those\nare scientific studies. - Yeah, I mean look, there's\nso much that we don't know about this forest. We don't know what medicines\nare in this forest. We don't know, with a lot of the 1,500, there's something like\n4,000 species of butterflies in the Amazon rainforest. And of the 1,500 species\nthat are here in this region, all of them have a larval stage. Caterpillars, right? And each of the caterpillars\nhas a specific host plant that they need to need to eat in order to become a successful butterfly to enter the next life cycle. And for most of the species\nthat fill the butterfly book, we don't know what those interactions are. I recently got to see a, the white witch, which is a huge moth. It's one of the, it's one of the two\nlargest moths in the world. It's the largest moth by wingspan. - [Lex] Wow.\n- Huge, it looks like a bird. Big, white moth. We still, I believe\nthat we still don't know what the caterpillar looks like. It's 2024. We have iPhones and\npenis-shaped rocket ships, like. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- We don't know where that moth starts its life. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- We still haven't figured that out. - By the way, the rocket\nships are shaped that way for efficiency purposes, not because they want it to\nlook, make it look like a penis. Speaking of which, I've ran\nacross a lot of penis trees while exploring.\n- Have you? - And it make me very, I, this, I know it's not just a\nfigment of my imagination. I'm pretty sure they're real. In fact, you explained it to me and they make me very uncomfortable. (Paul laughs) Because there's just a lot of\npenises hanging off of a tree. - [Paul] Yes.\n- I don't know what the purpose is. I don't know who they're\nsupposed to attract, but it certainly makes. (Lex laughs) But certainly, Paul\nlike really enjoys them. - Yeah, yeah, well clearly\nyou've done some research and you've noticed a lot of them. I haven't even seen them. - There was a time when I almost fell and to catch my balance, I had to grab one of the\npenises of the penis tree and. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Unforgettable. Anaconda, the biggest,\nbaddest anaconda in the Amazon versus the biggest, baddest black caiman. 'Cause you mentioned there\nlike, there's a race. If there's a fight, this is UFC in a cage, who wins on the water?\n- This is the biggest and the baddest? - The biggest and the\nbaddest that you have, can imagine given all\nthe studies you've done of the two animals, species. - Biggest and the baddest, you're talking about an 18 foot, several hundred pound black caiman versus a 26 foot, 350 pound anaconda. Yeah, I think it's a death stalemate. I think the caiman slams\nthe anaconda, bites onto it. The anaconda wraps the caiman, and then they both thrash around until they both kill each other 'cause I think the caiman\nwill tear him up so bad. - And the caiman's not gonna let go. He's just gonna get.\n- The caiman's never gonna let go. But then he's gonna realize that he's also being constricted. So then he's gonna stop and\nhe's gonna keep slamming down on that anaconda. And the anaconda is just\ngonna keep constricting. But if the caiman can do enough damage before the, it's again, it's almost like a striker versus a jiu-jitsu. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You know? If you can get enough elbows\nin before they lock you. - How fast is the constriction? So it's pretty slow. - It's, no, it's incredibly,\nit's incredibly quick. So it's, you see, you take the back and get\nme in choke hold, it's that. It's, I have maybe 30 seconds, maybe on the upward side\nif you haven't cinched it under my throat. But if you've gotten\ngood position, it's over. - Is there any way to unwrap a choke? - [Paul] No.\n- Undo the choke, defending? - Not unless you have outside help. Unless you have, you know, another human or another 10 humans coming to unwrap the tail, help you. But for an animal, like if a deer gets hit by an, no way, they don't stand a chance. - So the black caiman\nwould bite somewhere, somewhere close to the head and then and just try to hold on and thrash. - Yeah, I don't think\na large black caiman, here's the thing. Every fisherman knows this,\nlike the biggest fish, they're smart.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And more importantly, they're\nshrewd, they're careful. A huge, black caiman that's 16 feet long isn't gonna be messing\nwith a big anaconda, Like they, they'll, they won't cross paths because\nwhile they technically occupy the same type of environment, that black caiman's gonna\nhave this deep spot in a lake. And that anaconda's gonna have\nfound this floating forest, like sort of black stream,\nbackwater where it's gonna be. And they'll have made that\ntheir home for decades. And they'll already have\ncleaned out the competition. So maybe if there was a flood and they got pushed together they could have some sort of a showdown, but almost more certainly is that when they get to that size, that caiman at any sign of danger, boom. Right under the water. Just be, it's almost like,\nit's like even if you, what do you learn when\nyou're a black belt? You know, what do you\ndo with a street fight? You still run away. There's no reason for a street fight. And I think the animals\nreally understand that. There's no reason for this. - So like a giant anaconda\nand a giant black caiman, they could probably even\ncoexist in the same environment just knowing, using the\nwisdom to avoid the fight. Like, why?\n- Yeah, or they would have a big showdown and one of them would\neither die or have to leave. They would have a territorial dispute. - Yeah.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - Without killing either of them. - Yeah, on it, dude, nature,\nanything could happen. One of the things that me and\nPat wrote up was that I saw a yellowtailed crebo, which is like a six-foot rat snake eating an Oxyrhopus melanogenys, which is the red snake\nthat we found last night. And just no one had ever, in scientific literature, we'd never seen a cribo\neating an Oxyrhopus before. And so I had the observation in the field, I sent it to Pat Champagne, Pat writes it up, paper. And so it's like, it's this really cool, that's a really cool system 'cause we're just out here all the time. You end up seeing things. JJ's dad saw an anaconda eating a tapir. Tapir is the size of a cow. - [Lex] Damn.\n- And it's, that guy didn't lie, you know? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Some people, you trust your sources on that. He saw enough stuff, he didn't\nneed to make up stories. And you know how you, you know what I love\nnow is when you go to, when you ask people, when we were going up\nthe mountain with Jimmy. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- JJ said to him, he goes, \"Have you ever seen a puma up here in the mountains?\" And Jimmy goes, \"They're up here.\" And JJ went, \"No, no,\nno, have you seen it?\" And Jimmy went, \"No, never seen one.\" And you know how most people will go, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've seen.\" That makes me trust the\nperson when they admit, \"Nah, I haven't seen it.\" - They're up here, I haven't seen it. And Jimmy's been living\nthere his whole life. - [Paul] His whole life. - There's pumas in the mountains? - [Paul] You know, mountain lions, pumas. - Damn.\n- Whatever the, you know, there's all different names for them. They're distributed from, I think from Alaska\ndown through Argentina. That's, they're everywhere. It's extremely successful species, from deserts to high\nmountains, everything. - I think you're saying\npumas have a curiosity, have a way about them\nwhere they like explore, like follow people.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - Like, just to kind of figure out like just that curiosity versus like, as opposed to causing harm or hunting and that kind of stuff. Like, what is this about? - I think it's based\nin predatory instincts, but I also think there is a playfulness to higher intelligence\nanimals that you don't see in lower intelligence animals. And so something like\na rabbit, for instance, you're never gonna see a rabbit\ncome in to check you out. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You just, you can't even think of it like that. Like, a rabbit's just gonna\neither eat or run away. There's really two settings. When you think of something\nlike a giant river otter or a tayra, which is a,\nthey call it manco here. It's a huge arboreal weasel. And they'll come check you out. I woke up at my house the other day and there was a tayra climbing\nup the side of the house and he was looking down at me sleeping. And it's like, he came to check me out. Like, it's like they're smart enough and they're brave enough. Here's the important thing. They know that they can\nfend for themselves. They can fight, they\ncan climb, they can run. And so they're like, let me, I'm curious. I got time, lemme check this out. - Yeah, they're gathering information. I wonder how complex and\nsophisticated their world model is. Like, how they're integrating all the information about the environment, like where all the different trees are, where all the different nests\nof the different insects are, what the different\ncreatures are that by size, all that kind of stuff. I'm sure they don't have enough,\nyou know, storage up there to like keep all that. But they probably keep\nthe important stuff, basic, you know, so sort of\nintegrate the experiences they have into like, what\nis dangerous, what is tasty, all that kind of stuff. - I think it's more\ncomplex than we realize. You go back to that Frans de Waal book, \"Are We Smart Enough to\nKnow How Smart Animals Are?\" There's so many incredible\nexamples of controlled studies where the researchers\nweren't understanding how to shed being so insurmountably human and understand that there are other types of intelligence, and whether that's elephants or cats. So big cats, for instance, we just saw a camera trap\nvideo from last night. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Where you see one of our workers walk down the trail and then five minutes\nlater, a cat behind him. - By the way, we were walking\njust exactly the same area, also exact same time, yeah. - Yeah, so we're out there and\nthere's deer and there's cats and there's a jaguar and there's a puma, and there's all these animals out there. And we're out in the night, in the inky, black night, in this ocean of darkness\nbeneath the trees. And we're just exploring and\ngetting to see everything and there's all these\nlittle eyes and heartbeats. I love the jungle at night, man. It's the most exciting thing. - You know, one of the things you do when you turn off the headlamp. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Complete darkness. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- All around you. And just the sounds. - Everything you hear,\nthe cicadas, the birds, they're all screaming about sex. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- All the time. So they're just trying to get laid. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So all of them are making mating calls. Now the trick is to make your mating call without attracting a predator. - [Lex] Yeah. - But at night, what amazes me is that for us, it's so, from the caveman logic of\nit's hard to make fire here, it's hard to even light a fire here, to having this incredible\nbeam of it, you know? All of a sudden we can look at the jungle and walk through that darkness. Then we're seeing the\nfrogs on those leaves and the snakes moving\nthrough the undergrowth and the deer sneaking through the shadows. It's like, it's almost as\nsupernatural as skydiving. It's a strange thing to be able to do, that technology allows us to do. We're doing something really complex and we're walking on trails\nthat have been cleared for us, that we've planned out. And so walking through\nthe jungle at night, you just get this freak\nshow of biodiversity. And I'm addicted to it, I truly love it. - Except for the times\nover the last few days when we walked on, through\njungle without a trail. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And that's just a different experience. - Well, how would you\ncategorize if somebody said, Lex, I think I'm gonna go for\na hike through the jungle, not on the trail?\n- Yeah. - [Paul] What would you tell 'em? - Every step is really hard work. Every step is a puzzle. Every step is a full of\npossibility of hurting yourself in a multitude of ways. You just, a wasp nest under a leaf, a hole under a leaf on the ground where if you step in\nit, you're gonna break a knee, ankle, leg and go into, not be able to move for a long time. There's all kinds of ants\nthat can hurt you a little or can hurt you a lot. Bullet ants, there's\nsnakes and spiders and, oh, my favorite that I've gotten to know intimately is different plants with\ndifferent defensive mechanisms. One of which is just spikes so sharp. You have, I don't know if you brought it, but there's. (Lex laughs) - I didn't bring it, I didn't bring it. Where's my club? - There's an epic club with spikes, but there's so many trees\nthat have spikes on them. Sometimes they're obvious spikes, sometimes less than obvious spikes. And you know, it could\nbe just an innocent, as you take a step through a dense jungle, it could be an innocent\nplacing of a hand on that tree that could just completely\ntransform your experience, your life, by penetrating\nyour hand with like 20, 30, 40, 50 spikes. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And just changing everything. That's just a completely\ndifferent experience than going on a trail where you, where you're a observer of the jungle versus the participant of it. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And it truly is extreme hard work to\ntake every single step. - Now just think about this. I think scientifically, 'cause\npeople like to summarize, people like to get really,\nreally sort of cavalier with our scientific progress. And they go, \"You know, we've\nalready explored the Amazon.\" It's like, well have we? Because in between each\ntributary is, you know, let's say just between some of them, let's just say 100 miles\nof unbroken forest. Who's explored that? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Maybe some of the tribes have been there, maybe. Some areas, they haven't been. Now when you're talking about scientists, whether they're Indigenous scientists, Western scientists, whatever, so many of the areas in this jungle that is the size of the continental US still have not been accessed. And the places where\npeople are doing research, see, I've been down here long enough. I see all the PhDs come down here and they all go to the\nsame few research stations. They're safe, they have a bed. If you get heli-dropped into\nthe middle of the jungle in the deepest, most remote parts, you're gonna find micro ecosystems. You're gonna see little\nspecies variations. You're gonna see a type of flower that JJ's never seen before, like what happened the other day. As you start walking through\nnew patches of forest, you start finding new species\nand everything here changes. You just go a little bit upriver and the animals you see differ. You go on this side of the river versus on the north side of the river, there's two other\nspecies of primates there that don't exist here. And that's in the mammal paper that we did with the emperor tamarins\nand the pygmy marmosets that the rangers found."

      "section": "Mammals",
      "text": "- Yeah, the mammal paper\nis looking at the diversity of life in this one region of the Amazon. What kind of, can you talk\nmore about that paper, \"Mammal Diversity along\nthe Las Piedras River\"? - Once again, the mammal paper. Pat Champagne, the prodigy, he was sort of leading on this with a bunch of other scientists who have worked in the region, including Holly O'Donnell\nout of Oxford, myself. I really just made a few observations. The Junglekeepers rangers got featured because they're the ones\nthat spotted a pygmy marmoset that had previously been\nunrecorded on the river. I got to contribute because I had the only photograph that\nI believe anyone has of an emperor tamarin on this river. It's the first proof of\nemperor tamarin on this river. And that's exciting. It's exciting because, you know, you'll, you can post a picture or share a scientific observation\nor write about something. And then what happens is you get these like couch experts, these armchair experts who will come and say, you know, \"No, no, you don't get blue\nand yellow macaws there. I can tell from my bird book, it says they're not there.\" And they'll tell you\nyou're wrong, you know? No, you don't get wooly monkeys\nthere or emperor tamarins. It's like, but we have proof. And so we're coming together to try and add to that knowledge. - My general sort of amateur\nexperience of the species I've encountered here is like, this should not exist. Whatever this is, this is not real. This is CGI, like what? Just the colors, the weirdness. I mean, there's, I think I called it the\nParis Hilton caterpillar because it's like furry. It looks like a one of those. - [Paul] It looks like Paris Hilton's dog. - Like yeah, yeah. It's like really furry\nand it's transparent and sort of it's transparent. All you see is this white, beautiful fur. It's just like this caterpillar. It doesn't look real.\n- Yeah. - Do you think there are species, like how many species\nhave we not discovered? And is there a species that\nare like extremely badass that we haven't discovered yet? - If you look up how many trees are in the Amazon rainforest, it's something in the\norder of 400 billion trees. There's something like 70\nto 80,000 species of plants, individual types of plants here. 1,500 species of trees. It's so vast that it's comparable, like the scale is like only\ncomparable to the universe in terms of stars and galaxies and for the sheer immensity of it. And so we're describing\nnew species every year and just walking on the trail at night, you and I have seen, you know, you see a tiny, little\nspider hidden in a crevice. And has the scientific eye\never seen that spider before? Has it been documented? Do we know anything about its lifecycle? There's still so much that's here that is completely unknown. You know, we have pictures\nof all these butterflies. Somebody went out with a butterfly net and caught these butterflies,\ntook a picture of it, gave it a name, put it\nin a butterfly book. What do we know? What host plant do they\nuse for their caterpillars? What's their geographical range? What do we actually know? Not that much. So are there creatures out here\nthat haven't been described? Absolutely. - And some of them could be extremely effective predators\nin a niche environment. - Yeah, absolutely. I mean, certainly in the canopy, 50% of the life in a\nrainforest is in the canopy. And we've had very limited\naccess to the canopy for all of history. You know, if you wanted to get up into the rainforest canopy, you basically have to climb a vine. Or with scientists, when I was a kid, I always used to see them\nwith like the slingshots or the bow and arrows. They would shoot a piece\nof paracord over a branch, pull the rope up and then, you know, do the ascension thing. And then you're up in this tree getting swarmed by sweat\nbees, getting stung by wasps. You're trying to do science\nup there in that environment. It's incredibly hostile. And so having canopy platforms, I actually met a guy at\na French film festival who had used hot air balloons to float over the canopy of the Amazon and then lay these big nets over the broccoli of the trees. And the nets were dense enough that humans could walk on the nets and then reach through and\npull cactuses and lizards and snakes, whatever, just take specimens from the canopy. That's how difficult it is, that scientists have resorted\nto using hot air balloons. And so having a tree house, having canopy platforms, having, it's starting to get, there's starting to be\nmore and more access to the rainforest canopy. And so we're beginning to log more data. You know, we've even\nobserved in our tree house, which is supposed to be\nthe tallest in the world, we're seeing lizards that\nwe don't see on the ground, lizards that have never been\ndocumented on this river. Like, we're seeing snakes\nwhere they're saying, we saw this snake inside\na crevice on that tree in the strangler fig and\nwe don't know what it is. It's just people haven't been up there. - And that's where a\nlot of the monkeys are. That's where there's just a\nlot of dynamic life up there. - Yeah, I mean when you\nwake up in the canopy in the morning, in the Amazon rainforest, as soon as that, the darkness lifts, as soon as that purple comes\nin the East in the morning, the howler monkeys start up. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And then the parrots start up, and then the\ntinamous start going, and then the macaws start going. And pretty soon everybody's going, and the spider monkey groups\nare all calling to each other. And it's just the whole dawn chorus starts and it's so exciting. - So you're saying when they're screaming, it's usually about sex. - Sex or territory, usually. - Mm, sex and violence. Or implied violence or\nthe threat of violence. - Yeah, I mean howler\nmonkeys in the morning, they're letting other groups know this is where we're at. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- We're gonna be foraging over here, you better stay away. And so it's a little\nbit respectful as well. There is order in the chaos. - So just speaking of screaming, macaws are like these beautiful creatures. They're lifelong partners. They stick together. So there's you often\nsee, they're monogamous, you see two of them together. But when they communicate, their love language seems\nto be very loud screaming. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- What do you learn about relationships from macaws? - That it can be loud and\nrough and still be loving. - And still be loving. But is that interesting to you, that there's like\nmonogamy in some species, that they, they're lifelong partners and then there's like\ntotal lack of monogamy in other species? - It's all interesting. I mean, there's the\nanti-monogamy crew who's like you know, we were never\nmeant to be monogamous. We're supposed to just be animals. And then there's the other\nside of the crew that's like, we were meant to be monogamous. We are monogamous creatures. That's what God wanted\nbetween a man and a woman. And then other people are like, yeah, but I know about these two gay penguins. And so that's natural too. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And so then everyone tries to draw their identity. They're trying to justify\ntheir identity off of the not the laws of nature. So the fact that macaws are monogamous really doesn't have\nanything to do with anybody except for that it's beneficial\nfor them to work together to raise chicks. It's difficult. They rely on ironwood\ntrees or aguaje palms and it's difficult to find\nthe right hole in a tree. There's only so much macaw real estate. And so they need to use those holes. And each one of those ancient trees, it's usually 500 years or more, is a valuable macaw\ngenerating site in the forest. And so if those trees go down, you lose exponential amounts of macaws and that's how you get endangered species. And so that's why we're trying to protect the ironwood trees. - Another ridiculous question. - Tell me.\n- [Lex] If every jungle creature was the same size. - Oh boy. - Who would be the new apex predator, the new alpha at the\ntop of the food chain? - Dude, that's like Super\nSmash Brothers of the jungle. That's incredible.\n- [Lex] Oh yeah, yeah. - Like, bullet ants. If you had a bullet ant that was the size. - Yeah. Can it be like a tournament? - So everyone is pound for pound ratioed. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- For efficiency. So you have basically\nlike a six-foot bullet ant versus a huge black\ncaiman versus an anaconda versus ocelots who are the\nsize of jaguars versus. - Yeah, well let's go bullet\nant versus black caiman, same size.\n- But they're comparable size. - [Lex] Same size. - I don't know, man. I never thought about it. I mean, bullet and has these giant. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Giant, giant mandibles that could probably grab the black caiman. And then at that amount of venom, you're talking about a bucket of venom going into that black caiman. Black caiman's gonna get\nparalyzed immediately. - Well, insects have\njust a tremendous amount of like, strength. I don't know how they generate, what the geometry of that is. The natural world can't\ncreate that same kind of power in the bigger thing, it seems like. - [Paul] It seems like, yeah.\n- It seems like ants and like just these tiny creatures are the ones that are able to\nhave that much strength. I don't know how that works, with the physics of that.\n- Yeah, so like an ant, a leafcutter ant lifting that leaf. That doesn't make any sense. - Yeah, it doesn't make any sense. - It doesn't make any sense. - I don't know if that's\na limit of physics. I think it's just a limit of\nevolution of how that works. - One of the most interesting\nlimits that I heard somebody talking about recently was the reason that dinosaurs\ndidn't get bigger, even bigger. Because that's the conditions on Earth\nwere favorable towards it was that at some point their eggs reached, there's physical limits that\ntheir eggs reached the size. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- The eggs were so big that eggs need to breathe\nfor the embryo to survive. And their eggs reached a limit where in order to have a shell that could hold the mass of the liquid\nand the young dinosaur, if they got bigger, it\nwouldn't be permeable anymore. And I thought that was so interesting 'cause the entire size\nof physical creatures was determined by how thick shell can be before it breaks or before\nit can't pass air through it. - Yeah, there might be a lot\nof that like biophysics limits. - That's fascinating stuff. - Just like the interplay between biology, chemistry and physics of like a life form, 'cause like this thing, there's a lot involved in\ncreating a single living organism that could survive in this world. And bigger, you know, being\nbig is not always good, but being a big creature,\nit's for many reasons, like you were saying, the big creatures seem\nto be going extinct. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- For many reasons, but in the human world is\nbecause they're seen to be of higher value. - Given the current size of the jungle, I think that the MVP, the pound\nfor pound GOAT is ocelots. You know, you're talking\nabout like a mid-size, 40, 50 pound cat that can climb. That does, unlike a jaguar, jaguar, every time it hunts,\nit's going after a deer, it catches a deer, the deer could hit it with its antlers, it could tear it with its hooves. It's risking its life for that meal. An ocelot, ocelots walk around at night and they climb a tree,\neat a whole bunch of eggs, eat the mother bird too, kill a snake, maybe mess around and eat a baby caiman. They can have whatever they like and they're sleek enough and smart enough to get away from predators. They don't really have predators. And so they're sort of, they sort of occupy this perfect niche where they can hunt small\nprey in high quantity without taking on big risks. And so if you had to\nchoose an animal to be, it'd probably be like an ocelot or I would say giant river otters, which are so damn cool because they're, the locals call 'em\n(speaks foreign language), river wolves because they're so tough and they're so social\nand they're so like us because they're intensely familial groups. They live in holes by the sides of lakes and they swim through the water and they catch fish all day long. Piranhas, they eat 'em, just\nlike the scales go flying as they eat these piranhas. And they're so joyous in the way they swim and they have friends\nand they have family. And they, I think it would be, I think we could relate to\nbeing a river otter really 'cause I can't picture being a cat and being so solitary and just marching along a 15 mile route and making sure there's no other cats coming in on your territory\nand marking that territory. It seems very solo and very cat-like. - It's a lonely existence. - [Paul] Lonely existence.\n- And we humans are social beings.\n- We're so social. And so to me, river\notter is just like having a big, Italian family. You're like constantly\neating, you're freaking out. You know, just like causing\nproblems with the black caiman. - Take down a black caiman. - Yeah, start a street fight. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a family thing."

      "text": "You mentioned piranhas.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - What do you think, you know, they're a source of a\nlot of fear for people. What do you find beautiful and fascinating about these creatures? They're also kind of social, or at least they hunt\nand operate in groups. - Yeah, not in the mammalian way though. Piranhas are in large schools, but fish are so different. Like if you, I can talk to you all day about how much I'd love\nto be an otter also. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Going back to the fighting thing, otters and weasels, Mustelidae, tend to be very loose in their skin. So if you grab an otter, it can still rotate around to bite you. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So it's like if I grab you by the back, you're stuck. You know, like we can't, you grab them by the skin. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- They can rotate around and just shred you apart. So they're really cool fighters. Piranha fish, fish, I don't, you know, I don't identify with\nfish in terms like that. I think living out here has\nmade me think of fish as kind of rapid food that\ncan or can't be gotten. Like, you know, to me a piranha is just, is when I see a piranha,\nI think about how I want, how I want it to taste. - Yeah, so like fish is a food source of so many creatures in the jungle. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- So they're primarily a food source. But piranhas are, I mean. - [Paul] Predator as well.\n- They're predators. They're serious predators. - They are serious predators. I found a baby black\ncaiman not that long ago, and he was missing all of his toes 'cause the piranhas had eaten them off. It was really sad. He just had these stumps and he was swimming around\nthe water and I was like, you are not gonna make it. He was like eight inches. And he was such a cute, little puppy. He had those big eyes. And I was just like, \"Man, you already are missing all your toes.\" I was like, just a matter of time. No, he can't get away,\nso some big agami heron's gonna come and just nail\nhim, pop him down his throat. And that's the end of that for the caiman. - I mean, nature is metal. - Nature sure as shit is metal. - Bite off a little bit and\nthen makes you vulnerable. And then that vulnerability is exploited by some other species and then\nthat's it, that's the end. - Yeah, but humans are brutal too. Like that story we heard about that guy the other day who caught a\nstingray on a fishing hook, chopped its tail off to\nmake it safe for humans, cut a piece of the stingray off so he could use it for bait and then threw the live\nfish back in the river. Like, to me that is\nincomprehensible amounts of cruelty with flawed logic in every direction. Like, if you're gonna use the\nthing as bait, use it as bait. If you're gonna remove its tail, well then just kill it all together. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Or if you wanna save the animal and not kill it, then don't maim it before\nyou return it to its, it was such a weird. - So if you kill an animal, you want to use it to\nas fullest by using it as a food source.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - By cooking it, by, you\nknow, eating every part of it, all that kind of stuff. - Yeah, so we have,\nwe've been eating paco. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- [Paul] In your time here. - [Lex] Fried paco is great. - [Paul] Amazing, it's delicious. Full of, you could tell\nit makes you healthy. - Yeah.\n- I feel like we'd better work out so we\ncan go harder in the jungle. - Yeah.\n- And so a few months ago in August\nwhen the river was down, it was, there was a day\nthat the river was clear. And a friend of mine, Victor, who's married to a native girl, he said, \"It's time to go paco fishing.\" And at the time we were stuck out here and we had no resupply. Everybody was busy. And so everyone was demoralized. The staff was hungry, we were hungry. And it really became this thing of like, \"Hey, go catch us some paco.\" They were working on the trails. They were installing the solar. We were working hard\nand we didn't have food. And so we went out to the river and what we did was we went upriver, we camped on the beach. And in the morning, Victor's wife was canoeing with the paddle, dead quiet. Don't let the paddle\ntouch the wooden boat. Nikita was balanced in\nthe middle of the thing. Victor's on the front with\nthis huge fishing rod. And I'm sitting there and he goes, \"I'll catch the first one,\nyou catch the second one.\" And he's got this huge fishing rod and a piece of half rotten\nmeat from the day before. And he's smacking it against the. 6:00 AM, he's just letting\nit smack against the water. And I'm going, and we're\nfloating down the river and I'm going, this is not gonna work. And we're floating and we're floating. And a half hour passes\nand I'm going, it's dawn. I wanna go back to sleep. I'm such an, I'm just\nnot a morning person. And all of a sudden a fish hits that line, almost pulls this man off of his feet and he swings the thing in,\nthe fish comes on the boat. And then I realized he's got\na big metal mallet on the boat so that you could try\nto shut that fish off. And it's this huge, oar-shaped,\nthick, muscular paco. And as soon as I saw\nthat fish, I just thought wow, the strongest of this species for millions of years have\nbeen swimming in this river. And suddenly we've, through this incredible\ncombination of the boat and the cord and the hook, none of which we made, and the skill that he had from\nknowing how to fish a paco, 'cause otherwise no chance\nthat you're getting that fish. They hide, they're very, very suspicious of what you're doing. We had gotten this fish\nonto the boat and plume, you hammer it like a caveman,\nboom, it doesn't die. Boom, you have to crush its skull. And now you have this fish and you're holding this genetic material, this sustenance for your life that has been developing\nsince the dinosaur times. It's so beautiful. The act, the sacred act of eating that, of the fish, of the\ncompetition with the fish. And we spent the morning fishing. We got three pacos, three huge, giant vegetarian piranha. And I just remember touching\nthem with so much reverence, thinking about the incredible history and how that before these rivers existed, those pacos were swimming\nthrough the water and trying to survive through history, through history, through\nhistory until this, until we took just a few. And we did it respectfully and we did it when we needed it most, not at a time when it was just for fun. And it was really, really special. - Well, humans using them for sustenance, there's a collaboration there. That's something also that\nI've seen in the jungle. That there's creatures using each other and it's like a dance of\neither of mutually using each other or it's parasitic or symbiotic. It's interesting, like there's a medicinal plant you grabbed\nthat was full of ants. - Yeah.\n- That were like trying to murder you by biting, but they were defending the\nplant that they were using for whatever purpose. But there's a clear dance there of the ants using the plant\nand the plant existing, therefore other applications\nand other use for humans. And there's that kind of\ncircle of life happening. But the ants were a defense. So the plant didn't have\nits own defense mechanism. The ants, the army of ants was\nthere to protect the plant. - Mm-hmm, and did you actually, when you, remember, we\nput our backpacks down at that one spot and it was like the ants got on your backpack. And I said, \"Oh shit, this is that tree.\" Did you actually get\nbitten by one of those? 'Cause they're incredibly painful. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- The Tangarana one, they're like.\n- Yeah, yeah, surprisingly painful 'cause they're small. They, there's nothing like, luckily have not been\nbitten by a bullet ant yet. - Yeah, but it's just, it's amazing because they live inside the tree. The tree comes standard with holes in it that allow the ants to\nmove and to exist safe. And it protects their eggs\nand they protect the tree. And they, so we saw that\nspot where there was a perfect circle around the trees 'cause the ants had excavated\nthe other vegetation so that those trees could\nhave no competition to grow. The incredible calculation\nof how ants know to guard, come programmed to garden that tree and the tree somehow has been\ngenetically informed to have ant habitat within itself. It's mind-blowing. And it actually is the foundation of a lot of existential confusion for me, because how the hell is this possible? - Yeah, well one of the\nthings you mentioned that's also a source of a\nlot of existential confusion for me is ants.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - And the intelligence of\ndifferent creatures in the forest. There's these giant colonies. There's just giant systems. But even just looking at\na single colony of ants, them collaborating, leafcutter ants, is an incredible system. So individually the ants seem kind of dumb and simplistic.\n- [Paul] Mm. - But taken together, there is\na vast intelligence operating that's able to be robust and resilient, in any kind of conditions\nis able to figure out a new environment, is able to be resilient\nto any kinds of attacks and all that kind of stuff. What do you find beautiful about them? - [Paul] Like as you said, just leafcutter ants in this jungle. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- That's forgetting all the other hundreds of species of ants that are in this jungle. But just the leafcutters apparently digest roughly 17% of the total\nbiomass of the forest. Everything, all these giant\ntrees, all that leaf litter, 17% of that, almost a fifth of this forest cycles through leafcutter ant colonies. So they're constantly\nregenerating the forest. They're a huge source of the\ndriver of this ecosystem. And so to me, when you see them working, it's, again, like I said,\nyou see your friends as you go through the jungle, you see all the kapok\ntree, you see kania tree, oh, there's leafcutter ants\ndoing what it's supposed to do. And it's just so beautiful. I find them very beautiful. Army ants, they're so tough. They're so ready to fight. They have this huge mandibles. They're just ready to, they're just, they're transporting their eggs. They're moving from here to there. Anything that's in the\nway is getting eaten. They're just savage and they're kind of cute for that. Unless you're tied to a tree. - The savagery is cute, yes. - I find it's kind of\nreassuring, you know? You want certain things to be tough. That's their part.\n- Oh, that everybody plays a part in the entirety\nof the nature mechanism. - In the powerful play, but. (Lex laughs) - Yeah, yeah. - But the army ants are so savage. You know, like if you step on army ants, they will all kamikaze and\njust attack onto your feet and they'll just sacrifice their own life for the good of the thing. And they'll be trying to kill your shoes. And there's something\nfunny about that to me. There's something like\nkind of reassuring again, unless, unless, imagine if you're going through the jungle and you slip and you fall\nand you twist your knee. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And you fall in just the right way\nbut you can't get up. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You can't, you're stuck there.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And then army ants find you. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- They will take you apart. There are records of horses\nthat have been tied up and army ants come and they'll\ntake out the whole horse. - Imagine the pain of that. - It might be raining on\nus very hard very soon. - You wanna pause? - No, I think we'll stay here\nuntil the ship goes down. - We should mention that\nthere's this one source of light and we're shrouded in darkness. - [Paul] And now the night\nshift is gonna take over soon. And we are in the Amazon rainforest."

      "text": "- What does the rainforest\nrepresent to you? When you zoom out, look\nat the entirety of it. - Carl Sagan's pale blue dot resonated with a lot of people, that everything you've ever heard of, all the heroes, all the villains, all of your ancestors, every achievement, tragedy, triumph, everything\nhas happened on that one spot. This one tiny, tiny little\nrock that has life on it. And to me, the rainforests represent the crown jewel of that. As far as we know and to\nthe best of our knowledge and with our shrewd, scientific brains at their fullest capacity, this is still the only place\nthat we know that has life. And given that, the fact that there are\nstill these tropical, towering, complex ecosystems\nthat we are barely understand, crawling and full of the\nmost incredible life, it's just, to me it's so wonderful. It's so incredible. Those, the waterfalls and\nthe birds and the macaws and the jaguars, it's barely believable. Like, if you were to theoretically tell a hypothetical alien,\n\"I live on this planet, and there's just these places where everything is interconnected. Everything means something\nto something else and the whole is this\nsystem that keeps us alive. And each tree is pumping\nair into the river, and there's an invisible\nriver above the actual river. And the whole thing goes into stabilizing our global climate. And each little, tiny leafcutter\nant somehow contributes to this giant biotic orchestra that keeps us alive and makes\nour environment possible.\" That is beautiful. I love that. And so the rainforests to me are the greatest celebration of life and probably the greatest challenge for us as a global society, because if we can't\nprotect the crown jewel, the best thing, you know,\nthe most beautiful part, then we're really,\nreally missing the point. - Yeah, the diversity of organisms here is the biggest celebration of life that is at the core of what makes Earth a really special thing. That said, you and I have\nbeen arguing about aliens for pretty much the day I showed up. (Lex laughs) All right you brought a\nmachete to this fight. Luckily, the table is long enough to. - I can't reach you. - You can't reach me. So to you, Earth is truly special. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- You don't think there's other Earths out there, millions of other Earths in our galaxy? When you look up, you know, we were sitting in the Amazon River. - [Paul] Okay.\n- The dark, the storm rolled over.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - And you started counting the stars. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- One, two, and that was once you can count the stars, that was a sign that the\nstorm will actually pass, eventually it will pass. And that's what you're\ndoing, three, four, five. And it's going to pass. You're not gonna have to sit in that river for like all night. So just a couple hours to\nkeep yourself warm, okay. Each of those stars, there's\nEarth-like planets around them. - [Paul] Okay.\n- Why do you think there's not alien civilizations there? - You can write down a\ncalculation on a napkin. You can cite different Hollywood movies. You can point up to the\npieces of light in the stars. But if you, if I talk\nabout show me a single cell that's not from this planet,\nit's still not possible. And so I agree with you that\nthe likelihood is there, all indications point to it. It would be fascinating, especially if it was done in, especially, you know,\nimagine finding a planet of alternative life forms. Not necessarily even intelligent. Imagine just a planet of butterflies, whatever, you know, something else, that would be amazing. But I'm concerned with\nthe reality that we have in front of us is that\nthis is the spaceship, this is life.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And so right now, given that reality, maybe that's the case. Maybe there are other planets or maybe we are the first. Maybe life originated here. Maybe God, the universe,\nwhatever, maybe this is it. This is the testing ground\nfor something bigger and this complexity and\nthis diversity of life and this life that we\nhave is that important. And I think that part of\nwhat we do when we go, oh yeah, but there's other planets, where first of all we're\ntaking an assumption into reality without, I mean, you know, aliens are right now are\nabout as real as Santa Claus. We think they're out\nthere, but we're not sure. Maybe a little more\nreal because, you know, it could make sense. We, no one has an alien. No one's seen an alien, no one's even seen cellular life. And so I'm not, again, if they\nshowed up tomorrow, great, let's study them. But right now we have this\nvery simple threat going on where we can't stop killing each other and our living environment. And so while some people can specialize in looking to the stars\nand to other planets and talk about being an\ninterplanetary species, I'm very much concerned with the fact that here in our home turf, our living environment\nwhere the air is good and the rivers are clean\nand the trees are big and there's macaws flying through the sky and salmon in the rivers, not only do we have a responsibility to each other and to our children to protect this incredible gift\nthat is our entire reality, it seems kind of weird to, at some point, it, conservation\nseems kind of ridiculous. Like you're begging people to not pollute the things that keep them alive. It's almost kind of silly at a point. But we have this incredible thing where there are fish in\nthe ocean and in the rivers that come standard with life on Earth. And we're harming the\nability of Earth's ecosystems to provide for that life. And we are the generation\nthat's gonna decide if those systems continue to provide life to all the people on Earth\nand all the generations. And by the way, all the\nother animals that exist for their own reasons, other consciousnesses\nthat we're just beginning to understand, elephants, humpback whales, whatever, families of giant river otters. You, not everything can be\nseen from a human perspective. These are other species\nthat have their own stories. And so I'm more biocentric\nthan anthropocentric in that I think that nature is important. But I also believe that we are special. We are the most intelligent animal. - So one, I agree with you. There's some degree to which\nwhen you imagine aliens, you forget if by for a moment how special and important life is here on Earth, yes. But it's also a way to reach out through curiosity\nin trying to understand what is intelligence,\nwhat is consciousness? What is exactly the thing that\nmakes life on Earth special? Another way of doing that, and I see the jungle in that same way, is basically treating the\nanimals all around us, the life forms all around\nus as kinds of aliens, as, that's a humbling way. That's an intellectual\nhumility with which to approach the study of like what\nthe hell is going on here? - [Paul] Yeah.\n- This is truly incredible. Like, are the animals we've met over the last few days conscious? What is the nature of their intelligence? What is the nature of their consciousness? What motivates them? Are they individual creatures or are they actually\npart of the large system? And how large is the system? Is Earth one big system and humans are just little\nfingertips of that system? Or are each of the individual animals really the key actors and everything else is in\nthe emerging complexity of the system? So I think thinking about\naliens is a necessary, I like my town with a little\ndrop of poison from Tom Waits is a necessary perturbation of the system of our thinking to sort of say, \"Hey, we don't know what the\nfuck's going on around here.\" Sure, and aliens is a nice way to say okay, the mystery all\naround us is immense. 'Cause to me, likely,\naliens are living among us. Not in a trivial sense, little green men. But the force that created life I think permeates the\nentirety of the universe. That there is a force that's creative. - Now, the force that\ncreated life is a big one. And then the other thing is\nwhat do you mean by that? There's aliens living among us. You mean extraterrestrials? - Yes.\n- Living among us. - Yes.\n- You believe that? - Not like 100% but\nthere's a good percentage. I don't understand how it's possible for there not to be a very large number of alien civilization throughout just our galaxy. - But that's different than saying that they're living among us. If you tell me that there's aliens living five galaxies over and that they're just out there somewhere, I'm kind of more on your\nside than that they're here. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Because just like Bigfoot, like we have camera traps. We have DNA sequencing through water now. Like we can, you're\ntelling me no one found one wing nut of a ship in all, like the Egyptians up until right now, no one in Russia saw like a crashed ship, took a picture, tweeted that\nship real quick and you know? - I think there's no Bigfoot, there's no trivial\nmanifestations of aliens. I think if they're here, they're here in ways that are\nnot comprehendible by humans because they're far more\nadvanced than humans. They're far more advanced\nthan any life forms on Earth. So they're, even if\nit's just their probes, which cannot just even comprehend it, I think it's possible that they operate in the space of ideas, for example, that ideas could be aliens, feelings could be aliens. Consciousness itself could be aliens. So we can't restrict our understanding of what is a life form to a thing that is a biological\ncreature that operates via natural selection on\nthis particular planet. It could be much, much,\nmuch more sophisticated. It could be in a space of\ncomputation, for example. As we in the 21st century are developing increasingly sophisticated\ncomputational systems with artificial intelligence, it could be operating on some other level that we can't even imagine. It could be operating\non a level of physics that we have not even begun to understand. We barely understand quantum mechanics. We use it. Quantum mechanics is a way we used to make very accurate predictions. But to understand why it's\noperating that way, we don't. And there's so many gigantic,\npowerful cosmic entities out there that we detect, sometimes can't detect\ndark matter, dark energy, but it's out there. We know it exists, but\nwe can't explain why and what the fuck it is. We give it names, black\nholes and dark energy and dark matter, but those are all names for things that mathematically equations predict, but we don't understand. And so all of that is just to\nsay that aliens could be here in ways that are for now\nand maybe for a long time going to be impossible\nfor humans to understand. - So aliens in the\nstrict biological sense, like horseshoe crabs, we agree that they're not, we haven't found physical aliens. - The only way I can imagine\nfinding physical aliens is if alien species are trying\nto communicate with us humans or with other life forms and are trying to figure out\na way to communicate with us such that we dumb humans would understand. Like, let's create a thing. - Yo, there's a moth the size of a small eagle. (Paul and Lex laugh) - It's trying to get its\n15 minutes of attention. - It just might, it just might. - Big fan of the podcast. - Okay, Lex, I love you. (Lex laughs) All right, so what you're, wouldn't it be interesting, it'd be really fascinating\nto me if we found out that there were aliens living among us. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And we couldn't see them. And what some of the\npeople were calling aliens, the scientists, the religious\npeople were calling angels. And then everybody had this realization that whether you call\nthem aliens or angels, there are these other, there is more, way more to the universe than we're realizing.\n- Yeah. - I just for me, the fact that there's. - [Lex] There's a skull on the table. - Yeah, there's a skull on table. - [Lex] There's a skull in your hand. - There's now a skull in my hand of a monkey with a bullet in its head that I found on the floor\nof an Indigenous community where they eat monkeys. I didn't kill the monkey,\nso save your comments. But you know, in terms of the animals, I think that when I see\nspace, it, my feeling, and I'm not requiring anybody\nelse to have this feeling, but because we know, 'cause this is the only place\nthat we know that there's life and we have no idea how it started, I just think it's so\nimportant to protect it. And for me it's just as\nmuch about our children as it is about the little spider monkeys and the little baby caiman that\nare in the river right now, because life is so beautiful. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And I think that there's a huge amount of\nintellectual responsibility that we can transfer off of ourselves if we go yeah, the rivers are filled with trash and yeah, extinction is happening, but we have to be an\ninterplanetary species anyway 'cause at any moment this\ncould all end from an asteroid and like, everything's\ngoing to shit anyway. And so it's like, we're\nfucking up this planet and it's like, that's, we're just being angry\nteenagers who are, you know, going goth for a while. And it's like, what if you\njust rolled up your sleeves and said, holy shit, wait a second. You know, we can pretty\nmuch do whatever we want. We can fly all over the world. We have, we can do heart transplants, we can watch Netflix in\nthe Amazon if we wanted to. Like, we could do all this amazing stuff. We can capture on video our adventures and go back and watch them\nagain and again and again. There's so much incredible opportunity that technology has allowed us to do. And we're the richest in history. I mean, we could do everything. We could cross the whole\nplanet in a second. And it's like, that's an\namazing time to be alive. And if we just don't\nfuck up the ecosystems and kill all the other\nanimals, we got it made. - Yeah, so it is true that\nwe can destroy ourselves and nuclear weapons, but it also is true that that\nsnake that I got to handle yesterday is like one of\nthe most beautiful things Earth has ever created. In that little organism is encapsulated the entire history of\nEarth and it's beautiful. So we, both things are true. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- We should worry about the existential\ndestruction of human civilization through the weapons we create and we should become\nmultiplanetary species as a backup for that purpose. But also remember that this place is really, really special and\nprobably, if not difficult, probably impossible to recreate elsewhere. And by the way, there's\nsomething incredibly powerful about a skull. - Yeah, you ever hold a\nhuman skull, it'll give you, it'll weigh on you for a sec 'cause you look into this, the hollow eyes of this face, and suddenly you go,\nyou feel your own teeth, you go, you feel your own skull, and you go, holy shit. You go, what is going on? It's like taking acid,\nyou just go, oh boy, I forgot that I'm a ghost\ninhabiting a meat vehicle on a floating rock. - But even a monkey.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - It's like looking at a ancestor, you know? Not a direct ancestor, but there's a, it's like a, you know, like you looking at a\npuddle at a reflection, - [Paul] Mm-hmm, a little\nblurry, but it's still there. - It's a little blurry,\nbut it's still there. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- It's still there. And like the roots of who\nwe are is still there. And it's all kind of incredible. Do you ever think of the tree of life just kind of like where we came from? - Yeah.\n- [Lex] The jungle is ephemeral, it just keeps, it's a system that just keeps forgetting because it's just churning and churning and churning and churning, has in some ways no history. But to create the jungle,\nto create life on Earth, there's a deep history of\nlots of death, sex and death. - A festival of sex and\ndeath, life on Earth. - That's what I see in the skull. - Yeah. There's something, it's, there's something kind of\nterrifying about that image to me. Like when I hold that skull\nevery now and then at night, you hold that skull and you, it just reminds you that you're temporary. - Yeah, both you and I will one\nday have one of those, yeah. Hmm, mine will be bigger. (Lex and Paul laugh) - My God, the male competition continues. The silverback slaps the\nlesser male once again. - [Lex] Do you have a lighter? - Yeah, bro, you wanna light this blunt? (Paul and Lex laugh)"

      "section": "Elephants",
      "text": "- What are your favorite\nanimals to interact with? - I mean, my favorite,\nabsolute favorite animal to interact with is 100% elephants, which there's no elephants here, but I've been incredibly\nprivileged to spend some time with elephants both in\nIndia and in Africa. And I think that they're\nso smart and so complex that we do a really bad\njob of understanding what an elephant really is. I think that most children\nprobably think of elephants as like something kind of cuddly. Most adults probably think of, have a similar misconception of them. When you see an elephant, when you see a 12-foot tall bull elephant with bone coming out of its face, with huge tusks and those giant, it's an octopus-faced,\nbutterfly-eared behemoth that's a survival machine. And it'll look at you and just go, do I have to kill you to keep safe? And it's just, they're so tough. And they have dirt on their back and they have flower\npetals in the little hair, you realize they have\nhair all over their body and they, the power to throw\na car over, to flip it, just one of the most\nimpressive animals on Earth. And I think that I've gotten really good at interacting with wild elephants in a way that's respectful to them. And I think that when\nan elephant allows you to be in its space, it's because you're showing submissiveness and respect for the elephant space, and they're so intelligent that they're communicating\nwith seismic vibrations through the Earth, that they have high, you\nknow, a matriarchal society, that they can remember the\nmaps of their ancestors, that they know how to found, find water, that they can solve problems. They're such beautiful\nanimals and they're so, talk about aliens. They're so alien looking. - [Lex] So weird.\n- These big, weird heads and the trunks with all those muscles. And they're so different than us. But yet I actually think that\nwe grew up together, you know? They kind of raised us, sibling species, that we've been, we've inhabited\nthe same epoch in history and we've relied on the\necosystems that they've created. And I think that they\nhave a deep understanding of humans, elephants, and I think I see them more like aliens, more like non-human beings\nthat we share the Earth with. So I don't see it as we're\nhumans and they're animals. I actually see elephants as\nsort of a separate society along with humans as one\nof the dominant species on the planet. - So almost every species, especially the intelligent\nones, especially the big ones, are their own societies that overlap and sometimes co-develop. - Yeah, I think whales, I think elephants, I think that there's\nthose higher, you know, no one's suggesting that\nsardines are, you know, somehow need human rights or something. But I think the elephants need\nrepresentation in governments because they influence their landscape. They engineer their environment. They have emotions, they have families, they have burial rituals. They're so like us. And yet we treat them like\nthey're just oversized cows that we have to be scared of. It's, they're not the same\nas domesticated livestock. They're one of the treasures of Earth. I mean, look, let's just say\nlittle green men showed up and you said, they said,\n\"Well, what's Earth?\" It's like, well, there's\nmountains, there's rivers. It's like, well, how do I do this? You know, there's mountains,\nrivers, there's elephants. Like, it's like one of the first things a baby learns is elephant. Even if he's never seen one. It's just so iconic on Earth. Like you said.\n- Darren Aronofsky. - Darren Aronofsky, the elephant\nwalking over the camera. I haven't seen it. You said it's incredible.\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. Saw it at The Sphere,\n\"The Postcard From Earth\". I mean, it's a celebration of Earth. - [Paul] Yeah. - [Lex] In all forms, and one of the critical big\ncreatures in that film is an elephant. And it steps over the\naudience and the whole, like, the (indistinct) reverberates that power. I mean, some of it is size. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Some of it is like, how did Earth create this? It is a weird looking creature, but we take it for granted\n'cause we've accepted that this Earth can\ncreate this kind of thing. But it is weird, beautifully weird. - Oh, it's beautifully weird. I mean, elephants, there's\nsomething really impressive and wise about them. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- There's also beautiful weird that isn't so, that doesn't\ncome with so much grandeur. Like to me a giraffe is beautifully weird. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- But they're just, you know, they're 18 foot tall camel\ndeer things with, you know, giant necks. And they're strange and they're absolutely, serenely beautiful but they don't have that deep intelligence that elephants have. There's something that elephants have, - Do you see it in their eyes? Where is, how does the\nintelligence manifest itself? - Well, this is the thing. A lot of people, a lot of the, when I was reading Frans de Waal's book, a lot of what he was\nsaying was that, you know, people give elephants\nhuman problems to solve in controlled environments\nand call it, you know, a study on elephant intelligence. Whereas if you're watching wild elephants and you're in the wild, you're gonna be watching them\nin a way that they're looking, you've pulled up in a safari vehicle or you've pulled over\nto the side of the road and the elephants are wary of you. So they're not acting natural. But as soon as you start\nwatching wild elephants, truly in the wild, comfortable\nwith your presence, you see how they start\ncaring for their babies or how they can get annoyed. I once watched elephants\naround a waterhole, and there's this warthog, and I don't know why,\nbut this warthog decided he needed to get in and there\nwas this young, male elephant, and he kept turning around to this warthog and just being like, don't make me do it. Now, this elephant did not\nneed to hurt the warthog. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And the warthog was just like, I need a drink, I\nneed a drink, I need a drink. Much simpler brain. The elephant was like,\nyou could just tell, he was like, watch this. And he just went and crushed the warthog like it was a big beetle. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And crushed his pelvis. And the warthog dragged\nitself away on its front legs and probably went off to die. But this young elephant put out his ears and he like paraded\naround with his tail up and he was like, look\nwhat I did, destruction. And it's like, that's a\nvery relatable type of, he was annoyed with the warthog. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And so you see them do these things. I mean, the most magical thing, and I've spoken about this many times, was that I was walking with\na herd of semi-wild elephants that were crossing\nthrough a village in India because elephants have lost\na lot of their territory because there's so much\npopulation in India. And so we were crossing through a village, which is very delicate\nbecause the matriarchs are leading the babies and there's\nvillagers who have no idea what an elephant is. And they're watching the elephants cross. And the matriarchs backed\nthis girl up against a wall, and she was terrified, standing there with her\nback against the wall. And the elephant just put her trunk out and touched the girl's stomach. And then the other elephants came and they all started touching her stomach. And the ranger there\nexplained to me, just went, \"She's pregnant. They know she's pregnant. They can smell, they can\ntell, and they're curious.\" And they, all the female elephants came to investigate the pregnant girl. And she had no idea what was going on. And so it's like that stuff, that stuff. (Paul growls) - And it's cool to hear that, you know, with the crushing and the\npride of a young elephant that there's a complexity of behavior. It's just like with humans,\nI mean, you know, humans. - [Paul] That's not always pretty. - That's the thing, man. Humans are capable of good and evil. And sometimes we attach these words. (animals chirp) I love that there's just, it's an orchestra of different sounds. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And that's, that one is sex? - That's a bamboo rat\ncalling out for a mate, yeah. - A mate, all right. Good luck to you buddy. - Good hunting. - You know, humans are capable of evil things and beautiful things. And I wonder if animals are the same. You think there's just\ndifferent personalities and different life\ntrajectories for animals? Like, as they develop\nin their understanding of social interaction, of survival, of maybe even primitive\nconcepts of right and wrong within the social system, do you think there is a lot of diversity and personalities and behavior? Just like different people,\nis there different elephants? - Of course. And what I really like is that you said is there a perception of\nwhat's right and wrong? Because elephants have a code of ethics. - [Lex] Hmm.\n- And so as the, for the simplest example\nis that as young males begin to grow, they start\ndeveloping these tusks. And those tusks are a\ntool and they use 'em. So for Indian elephants,\nthe females don't have tusks and the males do. The females kick the\nmales out of the herd. The females keep all the\nsisters and the aunts and the cousins together. But the males are their own thing. And so here's the thing. If you have, so what you get is these crews of male elephants and the older males will, you know, there's play fighting that\ngoes on around, you know, two young males can play fight, but the older males,\nthey'll kick some ass. They'll show them how to behave. They'll explain who gets\nto talk to the females, who gets to interact, who gets to mate, who gets the best vegetation to eat. And so there's an order established. And so young male elephants\nhave to be taught how to act, just like a teenage\nhuman has to be taught. You know, you can't just haul off and break another kid's nose. You gotta, there's gonna be consequence. Maybe you'll get suspended, or maybe that kid will get his friends and beat the living shit out of you. Whatever it is, society\nregulates your behavior. And elephants have a very\nstrict, very predictable, sort of like the males teach\nthe males how to run things. And the females, which\nreally have the final say, they're matriarchal. They're the ones leading\nthe herd where to go. The males follow where the wise females tell them where to go. - So that regulation\nmechanisms from that emerges a kind of moral system\nunder which they operate, what's right and wrong. - For an elephant, yeah.\n- [Lex] For an elephant. - Right and wrong for an\nelephant is not the same as what's right and\nwrong for a grizzly bear. Grizzly bear, if you're\na male grizzly bear and you see a female with cubs, you just kill those cubs and\nthen you can mate with that, you can mate with her and\nput your own cubs in there. And it's like, that's a whole\ndifferent type of ethics. - Yeah, the value of\nchild life is different. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- From species to species. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Some of them hold it sacred, some of them not at all. - And that's why I think I\nresonate so much with elephants because they're, I think they're, I think that we are kind of matriarchal, at least I grew up matriarchal. Like, women were the force\nin my life, my family, and most of my friends' families, women kind of had the final say. And I feel like that's the\nway it is with elephants. Like, you might be bigger and stronger, but it doesn't really account for much if you're not smarter and\nmore emotionally intelligent and you know how to\ntake care of the group."

      "text": "- Just to zoom out into\nthe ridiculous questions as we were talking about aliens. - [Paul] Hmm.\n- There's a lot of people trying to understand, trying\nto study the origin of life. - Oh, I love this. - First of all, what do you\nthink is life versus non-life? Like when you look at like ants or even like the simplest,\nsimplest of organisms, we saw a frog in a stream yesterday that was like a leaf frog. It was like as flat as a sheet of paper. And it does a lot of weird things. And it found a way to exist in this world. But that's a single living organisms with a bunch of components to it. But like, there's a life form\nthat exists in this world. What is the difference\nbetween that and a rock? What is that, what is\nthe essence of that life? And this might be an\nunanswerable question. There's probably a chemistry, physics, biology way of answering that. Like, what to you is that? - I think to me, life\nis something that grows and responds to stimuli\nlike in basic biology 101. I think, and I'm fine with that. I don't need it to be\nmore romantic than that. But I think it's actually comical how, how do you get from a rock\nto an orangutan, you know? And our answer for that\nis primordial soup. Maybe there was just stuff on Earth and then the stuff just\ngot up and started walking. Maybe there just, there\nwas nothing happening and then there was all of\na sudden there was a cell. And the cell had function\nand then it complexified and then it started reproducing and found male and female parts. And what? Like it, we are so\nunderequipped to understand how the hell we got here, let\nalone ants or even bacteria. - I see this so many, in very simple mathematical models, like something Game of Life, they're cellular automata. You could see from simple rules and simple objects when\nthey're interacting together, as you grow that system,\ncomplex objects arise. Like that emergence of\ncomplexity is not understood by science, by mathematics at all. And it seems like from primordial soups, you can get a lot of cool shit. And the force of getting from soup to like two humans on microphones. - [Paul] Yeah. - Not understood and\nit seems to be a thing that happens on Earth. I tend to think that\nit's a thing that happens everywhere in the universe and there's some deep force\nthat's pushing this along in some way. That there's something we,\nI don't want to sort of simplify it, but there\nis something that creates complexity out of simplicity\nthat we don't quite understand. And that's the thing that\ncreated the first organism, living organism on Earth, that like leap from no\nlife to life on Earth, that's a weird one. - That's a weird one\n'cause you can imagine, I think that what? The Earth is 4.5 billion years old and you can imagine just this rock of a planet with like\nrain and storms and elements and iron and granite and\nlike, just random stuff. It's pretty easy to imagine that. But then I remember that book that I think we all had the same book when we were kids and then like they show\nthis like fish-like animal crawling out of a, out of the primordial soup. And it's like, bro, you just\nmissed the most important part, author of that book, bro. And I think the first\nbacteria came in around 3, 3.7 billion years ago, so there's like at least like, you know, a bunch of billion years\nwhere there's just nothing. It's just a planet.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And then we start seeing\nfossils of the first bacteria. - And the bacteria stuck\naround for a long time. A billion, 2 billion years. It's just very, very long. - Just bacteria.\n- Just bacteria but a lot of them.\n- [Paul] A lot. - There's probably a lot of innovation, a lot of murder, a lot of interaction. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Yeah. And then, I mean, there's\na big, a few big leaps along the history of life on Earth. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- You know, the predator-prey dynamic. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- That was a really cool innovation. It's almost like innovation's\nlike features on iPhone. It's like, it's nice, like predator-prey, eukaryotes, so complex,\nmulticellular organisms, emerging from the water to land. That was weird. That was a.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - Interesting innovation. This how, whatever led to humans that, there's a lot of\ninteresting stuff there. - See, I can't even get that far. I can't get from rock and sand to cells. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- That's a huge. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I mean, to everything around us that has cells, it's just, it's wild. Even again, and I could\nimagine being on another planet and how incredibly valuable\nthis thing would be. This, it's impossible to replicate. I'm looking at it through\nthe candlelight right now, and I can see all of the\nstructures in this leaf, the incredible structures in this leaf that look exactly like\nthe veins in my arm, which look exactly like the rivers that are flowing across this landscape. And it's like, life has\nthis overwhelming pattern that it uses and it's so beautiful. I just think it's, yeah. When you imagine the days of\nthe lightning and the volcanoes and the primordial soup, it's, there's a big gap there. And it's fascinating to think about and it's fascinating to see how different people's belief systems lead them to different answers there. - Not to give any spoilers, but \"Postcard from Earth\",\nso Darren Aronofsky's film, the idea there is there's\nprobes that are sent out from Earth.\n- [Paul] Oh, that's so cool. - To all these other planets. And each probe contains two\nhumans, a man and a woman. And those two humans are in love. So think of a couple in love. They're sent there with\nall the information, basically a leaf that\nholds the information, what it takes to create\nlife on other planet. - [Paul] Wow.\n- To recreate an Earth on other planets. And the two humans hold\nall the information for the things that make\nlife on Earth special, especially in human civilization, is love, consciousness,\nthe social connection. So all that information\nis sent in the probe and the postcard from Earth\nis those humans waking up, remembering all the information\nthat is Earth, that. - [Paul] Whoa.\n- Like a celebration of all the things that make Earth magical throughout its history, all the diversity of\norganisms, all of that. You're loading all that in to create life on that new planet, which is something I think\nalien civilizations are doing. They're sending probes\nall throughout the galaxy and they just haven't arrived yet. But anyway, that's another. - That's so beautiful. And one of the things that I think, I wanna see that so much and one of the things that I\nlove about Aronofsky's work is \"The Fountain\". And what I find so beautiful about that is that now here he's saying okay, we're sending probes\nout to other worlds, alien civilizations. And in \"The Fountain\", it was\nsort of what I thought he did so beautifully was braid\ntogether those three stories where in one, I don't remember\nif he's in a spaceship or if that's supposed to be like his soul. The other one, he's a scientist in sort of like comparable times to ours. And then he's the Spanish explorer. But either way, there's the tree of life and it sort of braids together\nall of the major religions. And it made me think of\nthat quote that you hear where it says, you know,\noh God, what was it? Christ wasn't a Christian\nand Buddha wasn't a Buddhist and Mohammad wasn't a Muslim. They were all just teachers\nwho were teaching love. And it's like \"The Fountain\" sort of says nature is the, that driving force. And it's our job to understand\nthat the game is love. And that's what the main\ncharacter in \"The Fountain\" needs to learn, is that it's\nnature that's going to just, that's going to carry your\nsoul through this thing. And that there's so much\nyou don't understand. And the epiphany at the\nend, God, I love that movie. God, I love that. - Among many things, you're also an artist that's trying to convert\nthe thing that is nature into the thing that we\nhumans can understand, the complexity, the beauty of it. That's what Darren Aronofsky tried to do with those couple of films. That's something that I hope you do actually in the medium of film too. That would be very interesting. And you do that in a\nmedium of books, for only. How much do you think we understand about the history of life on Earth? - I think we got it all wrong. (Lex laughs) No, I don't know. It seems like they change it all the time. You know, they say that\nEaster Island, you know, when I was in college, they\nwere big on telling you that Easter Island, they\nruined their environment and they had environmental collapse and that's why there was\nnobody on Easter Island. It was a cautionary tale. We could ruin our environment. And now it seems like they've\nchanged their mind on that. And then when humans entered North America seems to be hugely up to speculation. And, you know, the Africa spreading, that we all spread out of Africa and then the Pleistocene\noverkill extinction theory, and it's like, it seems like\nevery few years they update it and they change it and they say, oh, the guys, no, no, no, no, the guy from 10 years ago, actually, my new theory\nis the best theory. Let's write some books\nand get me on Letterman. And it seems like there's\na new prevailing theory that's really always exciting and edgy about how we got here\nand where we came from and how we dispersed and maybe even has some\npolitical implications, like how we should use\nthe Amazon moving forward. Like, the Amazon was engineered\nby people, so fuck it. Let's just cut it down. - Yeah, it's, I tend to believe that we mostly don't understand anything, but there is an optimism in\ncontinuously figuring out the puzzle of that.\n- [Paul] Sure. - We offline talked\nabout the Graham Hancock Flint Dibble debate on Rogan. I like debates, personally.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - [Lex] So Flint Dibbel\nrepresents mainstream archeology. And I actually like the whole science, the whole field of archeology. You're trying to figure out history with so little information. You're trying to put together this puzzle when you have so little and you're desperately\nclinging onto little clues. And from those clues, using the simplest possible\nexplanation to understand. And now with modern technology, as Flint was trying to express, that you can use large amounts of data that's like imperfect, but just the scale and using that to reconstruct civilizations. There are different practices from the little details of\nwhat kind of things they eat, how they interact with each other, what kind of art they\ncreate to when they existed, what are the timeframes,\nall that kind of stuff. - [Paul] Hmm.\n- And that starts to fill in the gaps of our understanding, but still the error bars are large in terms of what really happened. And that leaves room for things like Graham Hancock talks about, like lost civilizations, which I like also because\nit gives, you have a kind of humility about\nmaybe there's giant things we don't know about or\nwe got completely wrong. And that's always good to, like, remember. - It's confusing to me\nto imagine like what, I don't even know what, like what ended the why,\nwhere did the Egyptians go? Like what happened to. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It seemed like they were doing so good. They had so much cool shit. But I mean, I was reading\nanthropological stuff in the Amazon about tribes that, you know, just through their societal structures and through their hunting practices that didn't really develop practices that worked and kind of bands of\npeople that went extinct before they could turn\ninto larger societies. And there's a lot of\npeople that got it wrong. You know, for every explorer that leaves Borneo and\narrives in South America, there's probably hundreds\nmore that just die at sea, get eaten by sharks, you know, avalanche. And it's just, it's so\nfascinating to me that we, all of us really past our grandparents don't really even know where we came from. Like, do you know who your great-great-great grandparents are? Like, no.\n- No. I mean, there's methods of\ntrying to figure that out, but really again, the error bars are so\nlarge that it's almost like we're trying to create a\nnarrative that make sense for us. You know, that I'm 10% Neanderthal, therefore I can bench press this much and therefore my aggressive\ntendencies have a explanation when in reality there's so\nmuch diversity of personalities that they far overshadow any possible\nhistories we might have. - Your aggressive tendencies don't have any explanation, you're. - No, you need to, you\nlisten to me right now. (Paul laughs) - I'm sorry, don't hit me again. Don't choke me out again. - Yeah, man, one of the things\nyou and I talk a lot about is"

      "section": "Explorers",
      "text": "different explorers.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - Who do you think is, I'm just throwing a ridiculous\nquestion one after the other. Who do you think is the\ngreatest explorer of all time? - Oh God, I love Shackleton\nbut I hate the cold, so I can't, I don't really,\nI can't even read about it. I hate the cold so much. (Lex laughs) I can't even go there for fun. I think Percy Fawcett in the Amazon was the GOAT in terms of just sheer, the last of the Victorian era, you know, march forward, go deeper, just stop at nothing and then\neventually take such big risks that you never come back. It's hard for me to relate to that kind of exploration because to me, I'm such a softie. I wouldn't wanna like\nleave my family behind. I wouldn't wanna, like, even if you told me\nthat I could leave Earth and go exploring and I\ncould go touch the Moon, I'd be like, \"Nope, absolutely not.\" Like, the highway is dangerous enough. Like, I would never risk dying in space. This guy left his home, went out into the jungle out there with horrendous gear\ncompared to the camping gear we have today, no headlamp, and just\nexplored for years on end. - Well, let me actually push back, like you have that explorer, there is definitely a thing in you, just me having observed\nyou behave in the jungle, in the world, you're pulled towards\nexploration, towards adventure, towards the possibility of\ndiscovering something beautiful, including like a small, little creature or like a whole new\npart of the rainforest, a part of the world that\nlike is like, holy shit, this is beautiful. I think that's the same\nkind of imperative. So maybe not going out\nto the stars, but like. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- I could see you doing exactly the same thing. So he disappeared in\n1925 during an expedition to find an ancient lost city, which he and other people believed existed in the Amazon rainforest. So there's that pull, like, I'm going to go into there with shitty equipment with the possibility of finding something. - And they said he ran\ninto uncontacted tribes and started goofing off. I think he started, I think he started dancing and singing, like the tribes were ready to kill him. And he started goofing and\nlike doing a song and a dance and just being ridiculous. And the tribes were like, what now? And they're like, \"Wait,\nwait, wait, wait, wait. Don't shoot him yet, that's a funny one.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And they actually, he kind of like on a\nhuman level used humor to save his own life on multiple occasions to the point where he\ndeescalated the situation and was like, look,\nwe're not here to fight. We're here to, we have a\npile of maps, you know? All my guys have\nberiberi, dengue, malaria, like, we're dying out here. If you guys just go on your merry way, we'll go on our merry\nway and like, incredible. He was so tough. And then that guy from\nShackleton's expedition ended up on one of Fawcett's expeditions and you go, oh yeah,\nhe's a proven explorer. He's been through the Antarctic. And the guy was like, \"Fuck the jungle.\" (Lex laughs) Absolutely fuck the jungle. He was like, and there's a\ngreat quote where he says, \"Without a machete and,\"\nsomething, you know, I don't remember exactly\nthe words he used, but he said, \"Without a machete in this environment, you don't last.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And you know that now, like you in that tangle to just take three steps that way would, I would immediately be taking on, I mean, I'm not wearing shoes right now. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Bullet ants, venomous snakes, spikes through my feet, tripping over myself. I don't have a headlamp, unbelievable risk right there. We're sitting on the edge of tragedy. - Can you explain what the purpose of the machete in this situation is? Like, what is a machete? How does it work? How does it allow you to navigate in this exceptionally dense environment? - So this is the tool that I\nspend most of my life carrying. This is in my hand for 90% of my time. And in the jungle you\nreally need a machete. There's so much plant life here that you have to cut your way through. And like a jaguar, an ocelot, a lot of these other animals that are more horizontally based\nand low to the ground, they can make it, like when we got stuck\nin those bamboo patches and we were just hacking\nthrough 'em and it's dangerous and there's, as you hit the bamboo, it ricochets and there's spikes and then one piece falls\nand it pulls a train, a vine that has spikes on it and that hits you in the neck. And it just, the jungle\nis savage to humans. But if you are an agouti, a little rodent or a jaguar or a deer, you can kind of slip through this stuff. And the deer have developed\nreally small antlers. They can just kind of weave\nthrough low to the ground. And so for us being these vertical beings, walking through the jungle, it really helps to be\nable to move the sticks that are diagonally opposing\nyour movement at all times. So a machete's just a\nvery, very useful tool. It could help you pull\nthorns out of your body. As you saw last night, we\ncan use it to find food. - Mm-hmm, you want machete fishing, you cut a fish head off with a machete by like it was swimming and then you basically, you know macheted the water. And the other fascinating thing about that fish without its\nhead, it kept moving, so. - [Paul] That was amazing. - It was just using I\nguess its nervous system to swim beautifully. I mean, there's so many questions there about how nature works. (Paul laughs) - Well, let's explain it 'cause you, the way the machete hit this fish, it kind of took his, just his eyes off of and his lower jaw was still there. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So it was really just like the brain and the\ntop jaw that came off. And this fish as the dust\ncleared in the stream, this fish was, I found it very haunting in a\nvery like, interstellar way. Like it was just, the\nprogramming was still there, but the brain was gone and\nthe fish was just still moving and it was gonna die, but\nit was still swimming. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And it looked like a like a live fish. It was something. - And you're still trying to catch it, which is interesting watch, yeah. - And I had to work to\ncatch it because every time I caught it, it would freak out. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And then it would jump back in the water. And I'm programmed here\nfrom years and years of living in the Amazon that\neverything can hurt you. So you actually become quite, you know, if a moth lands on you, you flick it because it could be a bullet ant. And so even the fish here, a lot of the fish here have\nspikes coming out of them. And so even though I know that fish, I know its name, I've\neaten them many times, as I was holding it, when it would twitch with\nthat explosive power, just like the caiman, I would get that fear\nresponse and release it. And so that happened three or four times before I finally said, this is stupid. Even though he is slippery,\nhe hasn't got a head. I can hold onto him. I put him in my pocket. - Yeah, put him in pocket. - [Paul] And then we fried him up and we. - And he was delicious. So, and I'm grateful for his\nexistence and for his role and for my existence on this planet, this brief existence\nthat I was able to enjoy that delicious, delicious fish. So the machete is used to cut through this extremely dense jungle. There's vines, by the way,\nthere's rope-like things. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- That are extremely strong. And they go all kinds of\ndirections, they go horizontal and all of this, I don't even, how tree, we have a tree right\nabove us that makes no sense. (Paul laughs) There's like a tree that kind of failed and then a new tree was\ncreated on top of it. That makes, it just makes no sense. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- It feels like sometimes trees come from the sky. Sometimes they come from the ground. I don't really quite\nunderstand the, how that works 'cause there's new trees\nthat grow on old trees and the old trees rot away\nand the new trees come up. - Yeah.\n- [Lex] That whole mechanism. - Strangler figs, and so strangler figs, as you go across the world's ecosystems, that whole belt of, you know, whether you're in\nrainforest in the Amazon, the Congo, Indonesia, all across the tropics\nyou have strangler figs. And the amazing thing\nthat this species does, it's become a keystone\nspecies across the planet with a hyper-influence on\nits ecosystem wherever it is because they produce\nfruit in the dry season when the rest of the\nforest is making it hard for animals to find fruit, to find food. And so the bats, the birds, the monkeys, they all go to the strangler fig. They eat the fruit and\nthe fruit of course is just tricking the animals. The plants are tricking the animals into carrying their seeds to another tree. And so they're getting\nfree transportation. Monkey takes a poop on another tree after eating strangler figs and then that strangler\nfig sends out its vines, gets to the ground, and then as soon as it\nbegins sucking up nutrients, out-competes that tree for light, grows hyper-drive around\nthe trunk of that tree. And then eventually that tree will die and the strangler fig will win because it got a boost up to the top. Whereas these little trees down here, they're gonna have to wait their turn. They have to wait until a tree falls until there's a light gap. And then they have enough\nfood to grow quick. And so this whole thing\nis an energy economy. Everything is just trying to get sunlight. And so strangler figs, yeah, top-down trees growing over, parasitic, top-down octopus trees growing over other giant trees. And you've seen the size\nof some of the trees here. - So you know, back to Percy\nFawcett and exploration, what do you think it was\nlike for him back then, 100 years ago, God damn,\ngoing to the jungle? - Well the, see the thing\nis those guys didn't go with the locals.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They came down here with like mules and they tried to do it their way. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And so he's one of the people that\nwrote about the green hell, the jungle as the oppressive war zone where there's nothing to eat and everything is killing you. And it's, I think that image is so wrong 'cause as you saw last night, we could go, if we went out with JJ right now, we would machete fish some fish, we could start a little fire. We'd do it all in shorts. Like to JJ, it's green paradise. And it's intense but if\nyou know what you're doing, which the local people surely do, well then just beneath the\nsand there's turtle eggs that you can eat. And inside the nuts on the ground there's grubs that you can eat. And if you really needed to, you could just jump on\na caiman and eat that 'cause their tails are\npretty full of meat. And it's like there's actually unending amounts of food here. And so it's, they were pretty, you know, they were a strange bunch. - If you were able to tune\ninto the, that frequency, I feel like your, you and JJ. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Are able to tune to the frequency of the jungle that is a provider, not a destroyer of human life, right? - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Like I think to be collaborated with,\nnot fought against. - Yes, but we're coming at that with a, with our modern lens 'cause we're coming down here with I've survived how many\ninfections in the jungle. - [Lex] Sure.\n- Where those probably would've killed me before. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So my dead ass opinion of the jungle\nwould've been overwhelming and collective murder as Herzog says. And so Percy Fawcett was coming down here with this view of it's trying\nto kill us at all times. But we are flying down here and coming out here with\nour superior medicines and our ability to survive infections. And so it is different\nfor us, it is different. We're coming at this very, very different, but Fawcett to me was like the last of like\nthe real swashbucklers, like the really batshit crazy explorers that just went out into\nthe dark spaces on the map. And it's very hard for\nme to identify with him. But with, for instance, Richard\nEvans Schultes from Harvard, that's someone where you go, okay, now we're getting to the point where I can start to understand. I mean, just like the conquistadors. And they tell you the conquistadors\nshowed up and, you know, they killed, the Spanish killed\n2,000 Inca on the first day. And then they marched to\nthis city and they're like, when I hear about the, can you imagine yourself\njust like slaughtering a bunch of women and children and soldiers and then just like drinking some wine and doing it again tomorrow? - [Lex] Yes.\n- Like, I can't actually wrap my head around that. - Yeah, it just seems like\nan entire different world. - Nah, like different world. - Different value system. - [Paul] Different value system. - A different relationship with\nviolence and life and death. I think we value life more. We value, we resist violence more. - Yeah, like I just, I can't, like if we saw a car accident, I feel like if I saw a car accident, like, you know, or if you\nsee a little bit of war, some violence, like it affects you. These people were so\ncomfortable with those things. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It was such a normal part of their, the Spartans, the Comanches. Like, they became so comfortable with war to the point that it became what they did. - And they celebrated it too. - [Paul] They celebrated it. - And direct violence too. Like, taking that\nmachete and murdering me, or if I got to the machete\nfirst, me murdering you. - Not a chance, bitch. - I, and then I would put it\non Instagram and show off. - [Paul] (indistinct). (Paul and Lex laugh) - And the number of DMs I would get from murdering you with a machete. - Meanwhile, half the world\nright now is messaging me, saying my DMs are filled\nwith take care of Lex, don't lose Lex. Make sure Lex comes back safe. Lex is a national treasure. We love Lex. Make sure he holds a snake.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - The amount of love that is out there. - Meanwhile, I emerge from the jungle, blood around me with a machete and I take over your Instagram account. - He's very humble, he doesn't\nwant to hear about the love. (Paul and Lex laugh) - All right, so what do you\nthink makes a great explorer?"

      "text": "Whether it's Percy Fawcett,\nRichard Evans Schultes, by the way, say who\nRichard Evans Schultes is. He's a biologist. So that's another lens through\nwhich to be an explorer. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Is to study the biology, the immense diversity of\nbiological life all around us. - Richard Evan Schultes, I know about him from reading\nWade Davis' book \"One River\", which is this big, hefty, you know, five or 600 page tome about the Amazon. And it covers two stories. It's Richard Evan Schultes\nand I think it's in the '40s, I think it's like pre-World War II era, where he's in the Amazon\nlooking for the blue orchid and the cure for this and that. And he's pressing plants and he's going to these\nIndigenous communities where they still live\ncompletely with the forest. And they drink ayahuasca\nand they talk to the gods and they, he learns\nabout how they believed that the anaconda came\ndown from the Milky Way and swam across the land\nand created the rivers. And sort of, he came down\nand even though he was a Western scientist from Harvard, he embraced the Indigenous\nperspective on the world, on creation, on spirituality. And he sort of resigned himself and gave himself fully to that and spent years and years traveling around parts of the Amazon that\nhad hardly been explored and certainly never been explored in the way he was doing it, in the ethno-botanical, spiritual way of what medicinal compounds\nare contained in these plants and how do the local Indigenous people use and understand them? For example, you know, of\n80,000 species of plants in the Amazon rainforest and 400 billion trees in\nthe Amazon rainforest, the statistics of likelihood that through trial and error that humans could discover ayahuasca, it's astronomical, that one of these trees and\na root when put together allow you to go and\naccess the spirit realm and see hallucinogenic\nshapes and talk to the gods. That's almost enough to inspire spiritual thought itself. The fact that trial and error, it would take like millions\nof years or something. It's, I forget what the figure is. It's incredible, but\nRichard Evan Schultes was one of the first people\nthat came down and saw that. And then \"One River\" is\nwhere Wade Davis comes back, I believe in the '70s, and the heartbreak of the book is that all of these incredibly wild places with naked, native tribes and\nthese intact belief systems, Wade Davis comes back and\na lot of the same places that Schultes went, now there's missionary schools and they're wearing discarded Nikes and you know, whatever. I don't know if there's Nikes in the '70s, but like Western stuff has made it in. They've been contacted, domesticated, forced into Western society. And you know, a lot of them then forget the thousands and thousands of years that have gone into creating the medicinal, botanical knowledge that the Indigenous possess\nabout how to cure ear infections and how to treat illnesses from the medicinal compounds\nflowing through these trees is lost in a single generation\nwith the modernization. - Yeah, he wrote the \"Plants of the Gods: Their Sacred, Healing and\nHallucinogenic Powers\". That is interesting, you mentioned like how to discover that. Like, how do you find\nthose incredible plants, those incredible things\nthat can warp your mind in all kinds of ways? Of course physically heal, but also like take you\non a mental journey. That's interesting. So you don't think trial\nand error is possible? - I was reading about\nayahuasca and they're saying statistically, if, you know, if a bunch, if you put 1,000 humans in the Amazon and gave them villages to live in, 'cause humans are communalist species, it would take tens and\ntens of thousands of years or perhaps even centuries\nbefore even the possibility. It's like that thing, you know, a bunch of chimps on a keyboard, how could they write Hamlet? It's like astronomical\nodds to get to, oh wait, this and this dosed together. And so what the local people believe is that the gods revealed this secret through the jungle to us as\na link to the spirit world. And that that's how we know this, because if they didn't remember\nit from their ancestors, we would have no idea how\nto get this information from the wild. - So I will likely do ayahuasca. What do you think exists in the spirit world that could be found by\ntaking that journey? - I think that ayahuasca is, I can only speak from personal experience. And for me it was as if your brain is a house\nyou've lived in your entire life and it's a big house, it's a mansion and there's many, many rooms that you didn't even know exist, hidden rooms behind the bookshelves, under the floorboards, rooms that you had no idea were there. And some of them are fantastic and some of them are terrifying basements. And ayahuasca takes you\non a journey through that. At its most effective, you sit in front of the\nshaman with the candlelight, with the sounds of the jungle, and you drink the substance. And after that, what happens is the journey is all inside and the shaman's supposed to be able to guide you through that. But in my experience,\nyou're so deep inside, like falling through nebulas out in space, no physical form, or crawling through the jungle. Like, it's like you, it's\nreally, really powerful. Like, it's not like a, it's not like the recreational\ndrugs that everyone does. Like where you go, I did\nmushrooms and I could see, so I could see music like, and I was talking to my\nfriends about, no, no, no. Like, you're face down on\nthe floor usually vomiting, sometimes shitting, you know, having dialogues with the\ncreator and that can be, that can be traumatizing\nas well as amazing. - It's a really good way of looking at it. It's a big house and you get to open doors that you've never had before and discover what rooms\nare there inside you. You ever think about that? Like, that there's parts of yourself you haven't discovered yet, or maybe you've been suppressing? How much are you exploring the shadow? - Oh boy. - [Lex] So say you, me, Carl\nJung and Jordan Peterson are in a deserted island together. - Fuck, I didn't even make my bed today. (Lex laughs) - There's no bed on an island. - Great. I wanna see you and Jordan\nPeterson do ayahuasca together. I think I, that's the thing. Ayahuasca to me, you know, I've kind of told you\nabout like I've experienced some things that really made me believe that there's a benevolent force around us. But to me, ayahuasca was like a, was a ride through the\nscariest parts of the universe to sort of be like, here's what\nit could be like, you know? The, that's where I came up\nwith my idea that, you know, like deep space or just\nspace, outer space, it's just the outside of the video game. And this is it. Because when I was on ayahuasca, I was one of the jungle\ncreatures and I wasn't Paul and I didn't have a name. And for a long time I saw\nmany things and I was, I arrived at this spot in the jungle where there's a big tree and\nall the animals were there and they were all, not in words, not in any language\nthat we can understand, but they were all discussing what to do about the threat and the, and it was all, it was all leaving. It was all flying up and it was fire and the jungle was being destroyed. And it was like, I went, and then after that it was just\nspace and stars and silence, like crushing, vacuum silence for years. And that was terrifying. That was fucking terrifying. When I came back and I had hands, man, I could remember my own name. - You grounded, things are simpler. You're back inside the video game."

      "text": "What are the chances you think we're actually living in a video game? - When you say a video game, it implies that there's a player. Who's the player? Is it God? - No, there's a main player usually, that's not gonna be God. God is the thing that\ncreates the video game. - Oh, so then we're just. - And there's somebody's, there's NPCs, like I'm an NPC, you're an NPC. - Jesus Christ, so I'm the main character. - Yeah, you created me. - Is this like Halo where you\ncan kind of kill the NPCs? 'Cause. (Paul laughs) - I see how you put\nthe machete behind you. - Okay, I think I'm just\ngonna take a stand here. I think that because people, I'm just sick of fucking\nplaying it halfway. I think that because people live indoors in climate controlled boxes in cities far away from nature, they've completely lost track\nof everything that's real and they've started to\nthink that we're living inside of a simulation. Notice that nobody carrying\nan alpaca up a mountain thinks that we're living inside of a video game. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- They all know that it's real - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Because they've had babies on the floor of a cold hut. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- They understand the consequences of life. They understand the fish and\nhow hard it is to get them and the basic rules of the\nwind and the rain and the river and that we all have to play by those. And that it's, and you talk to a, talk to a grieving mother and ask her if she's\nliving inside a video game. And it's like the people, to me, this whole thing of, oh, are\nwe living in a simulation? To me that's a, that's the infirmary of\nsociety starting to that, to starting to parody itself. It's people going, I have no\nmeaning in my life anymore. So is this even real? And again, go ask the\nSherpa, go ask the Eskimo. They're not, they're not worried. - You forget what\nfundamentally matters in life. What is the source of\nmeaning in a human life? If you talk about such subjects. Nevertheless, you could for a time stroll in the big philosophical questions. - [Paul] Sure.\n- And if you do it for short enough of time, you won't forget about\nthe things that matter, that there is human suffering, that there is real human joy that is real. That the, our time in the jungle was very hard. - Did you suffer enough\nto know that it's real? - Yeah, I, man, I was hoping\nwe were in a video game that whole time. - So that's actually a really good way to, there was this moment that I watched where you were washing a\nshirt in this pathetic puddle 'cause we had no water and 'cause we had walked\nall day and tripped all day and gotten thorns in our hands\nand our feet and our legs. And we were lost in the\njungle and was nighttime and we didn't know if a big\ntree was gonna just fall on us and mousetrap kill us. And there's a lot of uncertainty. But I watched something\nvery special happen to you, and that was I saw you crouching\nby the side of this puddle. It wasn't even a flowing\nstream, so we couldn't drink it. And you were just trying to wash the sweat off of your shirt. And you looked at me and you just said, \"The only thing that I care\nabout right now is water.\" - Mm-hmm.\n- And I feel like in that moment we were\nunited in the simple reality of the fact that we were\nso thirsty that it hurt and that it was a little scary. - Yeah, it was scary but also there's like a joy in the interaction with the water because it cools your\nbody temperature down. And there's like a faith\nin that interaction that eventually we'll find clean water because water's plentiful on Earth. It's kind of like a delusional faith. And eventually we'll find, and it was just like a little celebration. I think the cooling aspect of the water, 'cause you know, the body\ntemperature's really high from traversing the really dense jungle. And just the cooling was somehow grounding in a way that nothing else really is. Yeah, it was a little celebration of life, of life on Earth, of Earth,\nof the jungle, of everything. It was a nice, it was a nice moment. I think about that. Had a couple of those. There was one in the puddle\nand one in the river. (Lex laughs) One was full of delusion and fear and the other one was full\nof relief and celebration. - Yeah, I've, you know, there's this thing that\nthey say where the, all the pleasure in life is\nderived from the transitions. When you're cold, warm feels good. When you're hot, cold feels good. When you're hungry, food feels good. And when you're that\nthirsty, water becomes God. And it's all you want. And also, the other thing\nis that when you're, when we're out there, it\nfelt so good to be so lost and so tired and so, like we were doing level, like how would you\ndescribe the physicality of what we were doing? The level of physical like exertion? - Well, it's something\nthat I've haven't trained. I don't even know how you would train for that kind of thing. But it's extremely dense jungle, so every single step is like\ncompletely unpredictable in terms of the terrain\nyour foot interacts with. So the different variety of slippery that is on the jungle floor is fascinating 'cause some things, I\nmean, the slope matters, but some roots of trees\nare slippery, some are not. Some trees in the ground\nalready rotted through so if you step through, you're going to potentially fall through. So it could be a shallow hole or it could be a very deep hole with some leaves and\nvegetation covering up a hole where if you fall through,\nyou could break a leg and completely lose your footing\nor fall rolling downhill. And if you roll downhill, I'm pretty sure there's a 99% probability that you'll hit a thing with spikes on it. (Paul laughs) So there's so many layers\nof avoiding dangers, of small dangers and big\ndangers all around you with every single step. So there's like a mental\nexhaustion that sets in, like the, just the perception. And you're just observing you, you're extremely good at perceiving, having situational awareness, of taking the information\nin that's really important and filtering out the\nstuff that's not important. But even for you, that's exhausting. And for me it was completely exhausting, just paying attention, paying attention to everything around you. So that exhaustion was surprising 'cause it's like there's\nmoments when you're like, I don't give a damn anymore. I'm just gonna step,\nI'm just going to, like. - And so that's it. You go, \"I don't care anymore.\" And you reach out and you go, \"I'm just gonna lean against this tree.\" And then what happened every time?\n- You get spikes in you, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n- And then you have to care. - Yeah and then there's just bad luck because there is wasp nests. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- This is just like a million things. And that is physically, is mentally, psychologically exhausting\n'cause there's the uncertainty. When is this gonna end? It's up in our particular situation, up and down hills, up and down hills. Very steep downward, very\nsteep upward, no water, all this kind of stuff. And it's the most difficult\nthing I've ever done but it's very difficult to describe what are the parameters\nthat make it difficult because I run long distances very regular. I do extremely difficult\nphysical things regularly that on some surface level could seem much more challenging than what we did. But no, this was another beast. This is something else. But it was also raw and real and beautiful 'cause it's like, it's\nwhat the explorers did. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- It's what Earth is without humans. And it, and also just like\nthe massive scale of the trees around us was the humbling size difference\nbetween human and tree. It's both humbling in that\nlike that tree is really old. It's the time difference,\nlifetime difference. And just the scale. It's like, holy shit. We live on an Earth that\ncan create those things. It makes me feel small in\nevery way, that life is short, that my physical presence\non this Earth is tiny. How vulnerable I am. All of those feelings were there. And in that, the physical endurance of traversing the jungle, yeah, was the hardest journey\nthat I remember ever taking. Every step. And then that made making\nit out of the jungle and then made it, the swim in the water that we could drink, that was just pure joy. It was probably one of the\nhappiest moments in my life, just sitting there with you,\nPaul, and with JJ in the water, full darkness, the rain coming down and all just, us all just laughing, having made it through that, having eaten a bit of food before and the absurdity of\nthe timing of all of it, that it somehow worked out. And how we're just three little humans sitting in a river. Just our heads emerged barely above water with jungle all around us. What a life. - That was a real adventure. - [Lex] That was a real adventure. - That was a real one.\n- Yeah. I'll never forget that. So it's a real honor to have shared that. Of course, we had very\ndifferent experiences. When you saw a caiman in that situation, you're like, I have to go meet that guy, that's a friend of mine. - Well, I mean we were in\nthe river in a thunderstorm, just our necks above, we're\nall laughing our asses off. And I mean, we're in the\nriver with the stingrays and the black caiman and the piranha and all the electric eels and everything, and it's pitch black out. And then what were we doing? We were holding our headlamps up? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And there was those swirling moths.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - The infinity moths all making\nthose geometric patterns. And it's like, we're just\nthree ridiculous primates. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- Three friends in a river just laughing.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Because we were safer in that river than we had been in there\nand we were rejoicing. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah.\n- That the thunderstorm was compared to the war zone\nthat we'd been living in, the thunderstorm was safe. And it was, it really\nwas a beautiful moment. - And also the like very\ndifferent life trajectories have taken these three\nhumans into this one place. - [Paul] Yeah. - It's like, what?\n- [Paul] Yeah, true. - It's this universe that would like, 'cause we're kind of like those\nmoths, you know what I mean? Like, where we come from some\nweird place on this Earth and we'd have all kinds\nof shit happen to us and we're all pursuing\nsome shit and some light and we ended up here together\nenjoying this moment. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- That was something else. It just felt absurd. And in that absurdity was\nthis like real human joy and damn, water tasted good. - Oh, water's good, man. Water and those little oranges. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah.\n- Those things and then I would just say like, do you feel like, I feel like running, like\nno matter how much I run, I feel like the, like you run, you do a workout and then you stop. Like maybe people who do\nultras feel this, but like I felt like the, we would, we woke up, it was like, you know, wake up at dawn, 6:00 AM let's start walking, you know? Break camp, go. And it's like pretty much\nyou just don't stop all day. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- And it's level 10 cardio all day long and you're sweating buckets\nand there's no water. It's like, you would never put yourself through that voluntarily. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- You couldn't, you'd never, you would never have\nthe resolve to continue torturing yourself except\nfor that we were trying to make it to the, to freedom, to get out. And it's like the obsession of that, with the compass and the machete\nand the navigating, fuck. - I think there's something\nto be said about like the fact that we didn't think through much of that. - [Paul] No.\n- And we just dived into it. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- I think there was like, there we're like laughing,\nenjoying ourselves moments before and once you\ngo in you're like, oh shit. - [Paul] Oh shit. - And you just come face to face with it. - [Paul] Yeah. - I think that's what, you know, whatever that is in\nhumans that goes to that, that's what the explorers do. The, you know, and the best of them do it to the extreme levels. - Well I think that what we did was to a pretty extreme level because we left the safety of a river, of knowing where we were\nand voluntarily got lost in the Amazon with very\nlittle provisions on an, on a very, now that we're back, I'm, now that we experienced\nwhat we experienced, I really can't stop thinking\nabout how fucking stupid it was that we did that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Because if we had gotten\nlost, Pico was saying to me even if you guys had, if one of you had broken your leg. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- It's, you know, days in either direction. Even if they had sent help for us, help would take how long\nto scour all that jungle? Sound doesn't travel. Even a helicopter, even\nif they looked for us, they wouldn't be able to see us. How would we signal for help? You can't really build\na fire and so it's like if anything had gone wrong, if we'd gone a few degrees\ndifferent to the west, would've taken us two more days. If we'd gotten injured, it'd be carry through that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And so it somehow, only\nafterwards am I really going wow, thank God we got out of this. (Lex laughs) Thank God after I see\nso many people going, \"Make sure nothing\nhappens to Lex Fridman.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I'd be the deadest motherfucker on Earth\nif anything happened. (Paul laughs) - It somehow works out. - It does seem to somehow work out."

Like, I think somehow she's alive, but she's already reached\nthat level where it's like Einstein, Jane Goodall, like\nthere's these incredible minds. And, you know, growing up as a child, my parents would read to me\nbecause I was so dyslexic I didn't learn to read\nuntil I was quite old. And my mom was a big Jane Goodall fan. And all I wanted to hear about was animals and so I would get read\nto about this lady named Jane Goodall, this girl who went to Africa and studied chimps and\nwho broke all the rules and named her study subjects even though that wasn't\nwhat she was supposed to do. And she became this\nincredible advocate for Earth and for ecosystems and for, and she seemed to realize\nas her career went on that teaching children to\nappreciate nature was the key. 'Cause they're going, you know, that thing where she says we don't so much inherit\nthe Earth from our ancestors but borrow it from our children. We're just here, we're\njust passing through. And so if we destroy it, we're dimming the lights on the\nlives of future generations. And so she's been really,\nreally cognizant of that. And she's been a light in the darkness. She's sort of in terms of saying that animals have\npersonalities and culture and their own, inalienable\nrights and reasons for existing and that human life is valuable. She's very big on that. Every day we influence\nthe people around us and the events of the Earth. Even if you feel like your life\nis small and insignificant, that you do have an impact. And I think that's a really\npowerful little candle out there in the darkness that Jane carries. - What do you think about her\nfield work with the chimps? - Badass, the fact that\nshe did what she did at the age that she did. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- At the time that she did. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Is incredible. It's actually incredible. She has that explorer\ngene and she also has that relentless relentlessness, is like this incredible quality. She just, you know, she\ntravels 300 days a year educating people,\ntalking around the world, trying to help bolster conservation now before it's too late.\n- [Lex] Mm-hmm. - And traveling 300\ndays a year is not fun. Traveling at all can be not fun."

So that book details his\njourney into the Amazon jungle. What do you find inspiring\nabout Teddy Roosevelt and that whole journey\nof just saying fuck it, of going to the Amazon jungle,\nof taking on that expedition? - Well, I mean Teddy Roosevelt, you could write volumes on\nwhat's inspiring about him. I think that, you know, he was a weak, asthmatic little rich kid that wasn't physically able,\nthat had no self-confidence. And he was very, and he had\npretty severe depression. He had tragedy in his life. And he was very, at least for me, he's been one of the people, like in the, one of the first historical figures who, where he wrote about the\nstruggle to overcome those things and to make himself from being a weak, asthmatic little teenager to sort of strengthening\nhimself and building muscle and becoming this\nbarrel-chested lion of a guy who could be the president,\nwho could be an explorer and one of the rough riders. And he's just, everything he does is so hyperbolically, you know, incredible. To come out of war and have the\nother people you fought with go, \"He, this guy has no fear.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I mean, he must have just been a psychopath and had no fear. And then proving it further was that thing where he was gonna give a\nspeech to a bunch of people and he got shot in the chest. - [Lex] Yeah, and kept speaking. - It went through his spectacle\ncase and through his speech, and even though the bullet\nwas lodged in his chest, this man said, \"Don't hurt\nthe guy that shot me.\" I believe he asked him, \"Why'd you do it?\" And then as he's bleeding\nand in the rain said, \"No, no, no, I'm not going the hospital, I'm gonna keep going with the speech.\" What a badass, that's incredible. - But going to the\njungle on many levels is really difficult for him at that time. There's so many things that could, so many more things even\nthan now that can kill you. All the different infections, everything. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And the lack of knowledge, just the sheer lack of knowledge. So that truly is an expedition, a really, really challenging expedition. So there's lessons about what it takes to be a great explorer from\nthat, the perseverance. How important do you think is\nperseverance in exploration, especially through the jungle? - I think it's all there is. If you hear about the people, and I think that is a\ntremendous metaphor for life because whether you hear\nabout that plane that crashed in the Andes and the people\nwere alone and freezing and they had to eat each other, and some of them made it out. Some of them kept the fire burning. And Teddy Roosevelt voluntarily,\nafter being president, threw himself into the Amazon\nrainforest and survived. Came so close to dying, but survived. And so perseverance is all of it. I mean, that's, I think\nthat's our quality as a human. - So they also mapped,\nso on the biology side, it's interesting.\n- [Paul Yeah. - But they mapped and documented a lot of the unknown\ngeography and biodiversity. What does it take to do that? So when I see you move about the jungle, you're always like, you're\ncapturing a creature, take a picture, write down like so you can find new creatures, find\nnew things about the jungle, document them, sort of a scientific\nperspective on the jungle. But back then there was even less known, much less known about the jungle. So what do you think it takes to document, to map that world, a new,\nunexplored wilderness? - I mean they're clearly\npressing botanical specimens. They're probably shooting birds. And Roosevelt knew how to preserve those specimens. I mean, he really was a\nnaturalist, so he knew exactly. So if he's seeing these animals, to them, whereas we'll take\na picture and identify it, they were harvesting specimens, taking them with them, drying them out. For them, it was totally different. And it could be the first, you know? There's, I don't know,\nI forget what JJ said. There's something like 70\nspecies of ant birds here. And it's like, so how likely\nare you to be the first person to ever see this one species of bird? And so for them. (Paul mimics gunshot) And it's, you have this bird, and so perfectly preserving that specimen. And I think a lot of\nnon-scientific people don't realize that every species from\nblue whale to elephant to blue jay to sparrow, whatever, whatever it is, whatever species we have on record, there are scientific specimens and the first people\nto see them shot them. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- And that's, the museums are filled\nwith these catalogs, preserved birds that these\nexplorers brought back from New Guinea and\nSouth America and Africa and then put into these drawers. And now we labeled them and we said, this is, you know.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - This is red and green macaw, this is scarlet macaw, this\nis brown-crested ant bird. And this is, and it's just,\nthey're just categorized. - That book of birds you have, like, encyclopedia of birds.\n- Yo, the human achievement in these pages. - For people listening, Paul's just flipping through\na huge number of pages. These are just, is this in\nthe Amazon or just in Peru? - This is just here,\nthis is birds of Peru. (Lex laughs) - Dude, pages on pages\nof toucans and aracaris and hummingbirds and ant birds and smokey brown woodpecker\nand tropical screech owl, which we just heard, by the way. It was just, it's endless. Who knew there were so many birds? I had no idea there was so many birds. - Documenting all of that. I mean, there's also,\nwhich we got to experience and you, you're pretty good at also is actually making, understanding and making the\nsounds of the different birds. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- What's your favorite bird song to make? - Undulated tinamou because\nin the crepuscular hours of dawn and dusk, they're usually the ones that make up what is considered by many to\nbe the anthem of the Amazon. - Can you do a little bird for us? (Paul whistles) - That's what a undulated\ntinamou sounds like. And it's usually like, oh, it is getting to be afternoon. And it's kind of, it's almost like hearing church bells on a Sunday. It's like you just,\nthere's something about it. You go ah, there he is. - And like you were\nsaying, it's a reminder. Oh, that's a friend of mine. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Surrounded by friends. - I have so many friends here. - What does take to survive out here? What are some basic principles\nof survival in the jungle? - Cleanliness. I mean really, but we talked about this, but like, you know, keeping, I have so many holes in my skin right now. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Look, I have a mosquito. There we go. I have so many spots that\nI've scratched off of my skin because a mosquito bites\nme and then I scratch it. Or the other big one is that\nI worry that I have a tick. Not deliberately, not\nwith my thinking brain, but my simian brain just\nwants to find and remove ticks and so I scratch. And then if my fingernails get too long, I remove my skin and then those beget, those get infected in the jungle. So staying hyper clean, using soap, like basic stuff. Keeping order to your\nbags, order to your gear. Things in dry bags. Make sure, you know, we did, we explained that we got in the\nriver during a thunderstorm. We didn't explain why we did that because the thunderstorm came\nwhen we had eaten dinner, but we hadn't set up our tents. And so we decided to cover\nour bags with our boats that we had been carrying, our pack wraps that we'd been\ncarrying in our backpacks. so all of our gear would stay dry. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- So the only thing we could do is either sit\nin the rain and be cold or sit in the river and be warm. And so keeping our gear dry, momentary discomfort for future, you know, that was, that to me was an\nincredibly smart calculation to make is you really just, you gotta be smart out here. You can't, you know, not\nrunning out of a headlamp while you're out on the trail and being stuck in that darkness. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It really takes just being a little bit on your toes. And I find that necessity\nof being on your toes is a place that I like to live in. It's just the right\namount of challenge here. - So keeping the gear\norganized and all of that, but also being willing\nto sort of improvise. I've seen you improvise very well 'cause there's so much\nunknowns, there's so many, so much chaos and dynamic aspects that like planning is\nnot going to prevent you from having to face that\nat the end of the day. - No, it's been really funny watching you sort of shed your planning brain. (Lex laughs) Like day one.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It was very much like, so are we gonna, and then I could tell, I could see your, I could see your brow\nsort of furrow when you, I would go, \"I don't know what\ntime we're gonna get there.\" And you'd go, \"Well, just tell me.\" And I'd be like, \"I don't know what the jungle's gonna let us do.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You know? Let's do, let's record\nthe podcast tomorrow. Okay, but we, if it,\nyou know, if it rains, if it gets windy, if a (indistinct) comes, if there's a jaguar with rabies, like anything could happen. Landslides, like anything, literally. - This tree, I mean the\nthing you mentioned, trees falling, that's\na thing in the jungle. - That's a major thing in the jungle. - Holy shit. First of all, a lot of trees fall. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And they fall quickly and they could just kill you. - They fall quickly, they're huge. We're talking about trees that are like the size\nof school buses stacked. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And connected to other trees with vines so that when they fall, this millennium tree, this\n1,000 year old tree, boom, it shakes the ground, pulls\ndown other trees with it. So if you're anywhere\nnear that for a few acres, you're getting smashed. That's the end of you. And so the jungle, at any\nmoment that you're out there could just decide to delete you. And then the leafcutter\nants and the army ants and the flies and everything, you'll be digested in three days. You'll be gone, gone, no bones, nothing. - Who do you think would eat most of you? - I would hope that like a king\nvulture with a colorful face would just like get in there. - [Lex] Dramatically go in there, just eat the heart.\n- Like right in the ass. Just like nature's metal, just like when they like walk\nin through the elephant's ass. I'd want that on camera trap. I think that would be a great way to go. - And would slowly look up and\njust kind of smile on camera. - Yeah, just rip out your\nintestines and just shake it. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Just victorious over your dead body. - Well, but also honor a friend. That's another way to honor.\n- Yeah, sure. But you know, you just,\nyou look so, you know, your white, naked ass\nlaying there in the jungle, you'd be like face down and shit. (Paul laughs) - That's why you always have to look good. Any moment, a tree could fall on you and a vulture just swoops\nin and eats your heart. - [Paul] That's right."

      "section": "Alone show",
      "text": "- We talked about\n\"Alone,\" this show a bit. - Yo, Rock House.\n- Yeah, who is, what do you think about that guy? Rock House, Roland\nWelker from season seven. He built a rock house. He killed a muskox with bow and arrow and then finished it with a knife. (Paul growls) - And had the GoPro mount to, you know? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- To document it. That's a really mind-blowing. I mean, so for people\nwho don't know that show is you're supposed to\nsurvive as long as possible. On season seven of the show, they literally said you can only win it if you survive 100 days. And that's, there's a lot\nof aspects of that show that's difficult, one of which is it's in the cold. The other is they get just\na handful of supplies, no food, nothing, none of that, so they have to figure all of that out. And this is probably one\nof the greatest performers on the show, Roland Welker. He built a rock house shelter. So what, I mean, what\ndoes survival entail? It's building a shelter, fire, catching food, staying warm, getting enough energy to\nsort of keep doing the work. It takes a lot of work. Like building the rock house, I read that it took 500\ncalories an hour from him. - [Paul] Whoa.\n- So he had to feed himself, right, quite a lot. You're lifting 200 pound boulders and still the guy lost I read 44 pounds, which is 20% of his body weight. So that's survival. What lessons, what inspiration do you draw from him? - I think he was fun to watch because he had this indomitable spirit. He was just, he wasn't there\nto commune with nature. He was there to win. And he was like, to me\nthat's the pioneer mentality. He just, he was just, he\ngoes, \"I'm a hunting guide. I'm out here, I'm gonna win that money. I'm gonna survive through the winter.\" He wasn't worried. I feel like so many people are like, they worry, second guessing themselves. Am I in a video game? I don't know. What's my, you know, just questioning their\nentire existential identity. And this guy was like, you know what? There's a muskox over there. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- I'm gonna shoot it. I'm gonna stab it and then\nI'm gonna make a pouch out of its ballsack and\nI'm gonna live off that for the next few months and\nwin a half a million dollars. And that's an amazing\namount of pragmatic optimism that I just enjoyed.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And every time he would go, \"We gotta get back to Rock House.\" And it became.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Even though he is all alone, it was, he had a big smile on his face. And what made that season\nso great was that it was him and then it was Callie. And Roland had, you know, the muscle and could make Rock House. And then Callie was the opposite. She was this girl who, yeah,\nshe could hunt with her bow and she knew how to fish and\nshe wasn't using raw power. But what was so endearing about her was that how much she loved being out there, as hard as it was and as\nisolationist as it was, she was smiling every time, every time the show cut\nto her, she was like, \"Hey everybody, it's morning. Can you believe the frost?\" Like, you've been out there for 100 days. Amazing, I think it was\nreally an amazing show of that the game is all here. The game of life. The game of alone and the game of life because it's the same thing. - Yeah, she maintained\nthat sort of silliness, the goofiness all through it. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- When the conditions got really tough and she had a\nvery different perspective. As you know, Roland didn't\nwant any of the spirituality. He was very pragmatic.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - And from Callie's, very spiritual connection to the land. She said something like she wanted not only to take from the\nland, but to give back. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- I mean there's this kinda. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Poetic, spiritual connection to the land as such a\ndire contrast to Roland. And, but she's still a badass. I mean, to survive, no matter what, no matter the kind of\npersonality you have, you have to be a badass. I think she took a porcupine quill from her shoulder. - That was crazy 'cause it, I think it went in.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Somewhere completely different and it migrated to her shoulder. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And the way I understood that is because they have,\nI said that's impossible. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Because I remember that, she's like pulling up\nher shirt and she's like, there's something. And then she like pushes it out. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And I remember like, I was like, hold up, hold\nup, hold up, hold up. How?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And it was because the\nbarbs, once it goes in, as you move and flex your body, it moves a little bit each time\nand it gets, migrate, like. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I didn't even think of that shit.\n- Plus, if I remember correctly, I think she\ncaught two porcupines. The second one was like rotting\nor something, or infected, it had an infected body, whatever. - Had the spots on it, yeah.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - She chose not to eat it. - No and then she chose\nnot to eat it at first and then she decided to eat it eventually. - [Paul] Yeah, I forgot that. - Yeah, and she, that was an insane sort of really thoughtful, focused, collected decision, waiting a day and then saying, \"Fuck it, I need this fat.\"\n- [Paul] I need this. - And that was the other thing\nis like, fat is important. - [Paul] Oh yeah. - It's like meat is not enough. You learn about like what are the different food sources there? Apparently there's like\nrabbit starvation is a thing because when you have too much lean meat, it doesn't nourish the body. Fat is the thing that nourishes the body, especially in cold conditions. So that's a thing.\n- Yeah, she was incredible and I thought as brash and\nsort of fun as Roland was, she represented a much\nmore beautiful take on it. And it was really\nheartbreaking when she lost 'cause I mean, and like\nyou said, still a badass. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It's kind of like Forrest Griffin versus Stephan Bonner. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Like, it was like it doesn't matter who won. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You guys beat the shit out of each other, like. - [Lex] And she didn't really lose, right? - No.\n- She got evaced. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Because her toe was going. - Frostbite.\n- Frostbite, 100 days. You think you can do 100 days? - Honestly, I've done a, I've. (Lex laughs) I'm 18 years in the Amazon, man. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I just, at this point it's, I could.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I wouldn't sign up for\nanother 100 days, you know? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- At this point, I don't have that to prove. I've survived in the wild and I wouldn't want to\nvoluntarily take 100 days away from everyone I know. - Yeah, the loneliness aspect is tough. - We're not meant for that. I really love the people I have in my life and I wouldn't, and you see it on the show. A lot of the people.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Big, tough ex-Navy SEALs who are survival experts\nwho know what they're doing. They get out there and they go, \"You know what? I miss my family.\"\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And they go, \"It's not worth it.\" They have this existential realization. They go, \"We only got, I only got so many years here. Like let's, this is crazy. It's just some money, fuck it.\" And they go home. - You know what's funny? 'Cause you sometimes feeling\nyourself in the jungle when you're alone. And there's another guy, Jordan Jonas, Hobo Jordo, he's the season six winner. And he said that the camera\nmade him feel less lonely. I've heard of him from multiple channels. One of the things is he\nspent all of his 20s in, living in Siberia with\nthe tribes out there. - [Paul] Whoa. - Herzog, \"Happy People\". - [Paul] Mm.\n- And so he actually talked about that it's one of the\nloneliest time of his life because when he went up there, he didn't speak Russian and he\nneeded to learn the language. And even though you\nhave people around you, when you don't speak their language, it feels really, really lonely. And he felt less lonely on the show 'cause he had the camera and he felt like he\ncould talk to the camera. - [Paul] Interesting.\n- There is an element when you have in these harsh conditions, if you like record something, you feel like you're talking\nto another human through it even if it's just a recording. I sometimes feel that like, maybe 'cause I imagine a specific person that will watch it and I feel like I'm\ntalking to that person. - Well, I noticed that when\nthings got especially hard, and they did get especially hard when we were out in the wilderness, that you would begin filming to share that struggle. But I also think that\nI've used that at times where yeah, you go, well maybe if I, 'cause if you can tell\nsomeone else about it, then you're on the hero's journey. And then it sort of has to make you braver and it changes how you, 'cause you go, I'm cold and I'm tired and I'm hungry and this hurts and that hurts and I don't know when we're gonna make it and how is this gonna go? And all of a sudden you go, well guys, we're here\nand we're going that way. (Lex laughs) And then you're like,\nwell I gotta keep going. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- 'Cause you're like, they're still out there if you forget. - You have to step up. That's one of the reasons I want a family. I think when you have kids.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - You have to be like, you have to be the best version\nof yourself like for them. - All my friends with kids\nthat I've seen them go through, where until you have a family, you're just playing around, man. I mean, you could do important work. You can have skin in the, in other games, but it's, once you have a little tribe of humans\nthat depends on you. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- If you take that seriously, if you want to do that right, it's one of the hardest\nthings you could do. And it just, it just changes everything."

      "section": "Protecting the rainforest",
      "text": "- How has your life\nchanged since we last met? - Speak about changing everything. - So you've been, for\npeople who don't know, pushing Junglekeepers forward\ninto uncharted territories, saving more and more and\nmore and more rainforests. There's a lot I could ask you about that. There's a lot of stories to be told there. It's a fight, it's a battle, it's a battle to protect this beautiful area of rainforest, of nature. But since we last met, you've made, you've continued to\nmake a lot of progress. So what's the story of Junglekeepers? Leading up to the moment we met and after and everything you're\ngoing, doing right now? - 18 years ago when I\nfirst came to the jungle, I was a kid from New\nYork who always dreamed since I was six years\nold, maybe even younger, of going to a place where\nanimals were everywhere and there's big trees\nand skyscrapers of life. And so being dyslexic and\nnot fitting in in school and reading about Jane Goodall and having \"Lord of the Rings\" be one\nof the things I grew up on, I just chose to come to the Amazon. And the first person I met was this local, Indigenous\nconservationist named Juan Julio Durand, who was trying to protect\nthis remote river, the Las Piedras River, which in history, apparently\nFawcett referenced either the Las Piedras,\nbut he called it Tahuamanu and said, \"Don't go there.\" (Lex laughs) \"You'll surely die from tribes.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And so there's very few references to this river in history. It's stayed very wild\nbecause it's been a place that the law hasn't made it, the government hasn't really extended to, like, you know, we're sort\nof past the police limit. And so JJ was out here ages ago trying to protect this river\nbefore it was too late. And when I met him, I was just a barely out of high school kid with a dream of just\nseeing the rainforest, let alone seeing a giant anaconda or having any sort of\nmeaningful experience or contribution to the narrative. And somehow over all\nthe years that we began working together and sparked a friendship and began exploring and\ngoing on expeditions and bringing people to the rainforest and asking them for help and manifesting the hell\nout of this insane dream that we had. I mean, we didn't even have a boat. We would take logs down the river. We would have to cut a tree down every time we wanted to return to civilization. We'd have to cut down a balsa\ntree and float down the river. - [Lex] Float down the river on it, yeah. - It was, it's madness. Like, it's madness, it's pure madness. And I don't know what made us keep going, but along the way, people\nshowed up who cared and who wanted to help. And if it was a movie, it\nwouldn't even necessarily be a good movie 'cause you'd go, oh, please, you're just telling me that\nyou just kept doing the thing and just magically people showed up. But yeah, that's what happened. That's exactly the way it went. We kept doing the thing that we loved. We said, \"It doesn't matter\nif we don't have funding or a boat or gasoline\nor friends or anything.\" We just kept going. And along the way we found\nsomeone who could help us start a ranger program. And then we found Dax Dasilva, who helped us fund the\nbeginning of Junglekeepers. And then people like Mohsin\nand Stefan who were there making sure that this\nthing actually took flight off the ground. And then right around the\ntime that we were wondering what was gonna happen and if we're all gonna have\nto quit and get real jobs and if we could actually\nsave the rainforest from the destruction that was coming, Lex Fridman sends me a DM and honestly changed the entire narrative. Because up until then we had been, we'd been playing in the minor leagues, pretending, trying real, real hard. And the listeners of your show in the moments after you\npublished your episode with our conversation\nbegan showing up in droves and supporting Junglekeepers, putting in five, 10, 100, 1,000. We started getting these donations and the incredible team that I work with, we all went into hyperdrive. Everybody, everybody started going nuts. We all started spending\n16 hour days working to try and deal with the tidal wave that Lex sent towards us. Just 'cause so many people\nknew that we were doing this, that was an Indigenous-led\nfight to protect this incredibly ancient, virgin rainforest before it was cut. And people resonated with that. And so we got this huge swell of support. And this year, we've protected thousands and thousands of\nmore acres of rainforest because of that swell of support. - So current 50,000\nacres, what's the goal? What's the approach to\nsaving this rainforest? - Since we printed this,\nit's gone up to 66,000 acres. It's, and as you know, in each\nof those little acres are millions and millions of animal heartbeats and societies of animals. And the goal here is that we're\nbetween Manu National Park, Alto Purus National Park, the Tambopata Reserve. We're in a region that's known as the biodiversity capital of Peru, one of the most biodiverse\nparts of the Western Amazon. And we're fighting along the edge of the Trans-Amazon Highway. And so it's just a small\ngroup of local people and some international\nexperts who have come together and used these incredibly out\nof side of the box strategies to sort of crowdfund conservation, to go, look, we know that\nthis incredible life is here. We have the scientific evidence, we have the national park system. If we can protect this\nbefore they cut it down, we could do something\nof global significance. All these jaguars, all these monkeys, all these undescribed medicines, the uncontacted tribes that\nwe share this forest with, could all be protected. And people have stepped up\nand begun to make that happen. And there's people from all over the world and it's incredible. - But what's the approach? So trying to, with donations, to buy out more and more of the\nland and then protect it. - So the approach is that currently the\ngovernment favors extractors. So if you're a gold miner\nor an illegal logger, or you just want to cut down\nand burn a bunch of rainforests and set up a cacao farm, the\ngovernment's fine with that. It doesn't matter. You're not really breaking\nthe law if you destroy nature. - So as long as you're producing\nsomething from the land, they don't see it as a loss the nature was destroyed permanently. - Yeah, it's just wilderness. It's sort of just beyond the scope of, it's not, doesn't, or the local people that\ntechnically own the land out here, the local Indigenous people, for instance, we fought this year to help the community of Puerto Nuevo, who's been fighting for 20 years to have government recognized land. These are Indigenous people in the Amazon fighting to protect their own land. And you know what it was\nthat was holding 'em back? They didn't understand how the system of legal documents worked to certify that titled land. They didn't really have the funding to go from their very, very remote\ncommunity into the offices. And so Junglekeepers\nhelped them with that. And so really all we're doing is helping local people protect the forest that is their world. That's it.\n- If people donate, how will that help? - If people donate to Junglekeepers, what you're doing is you're helping someone like JJ, who's an Indigenous\nnaturalist who has the vision, who has seen forest be destroyed, he's trying to protect\nit before it's too late. You're saving mahogany\ntrees, ironwood trees, kapok trees, skyscrapers of life, just monkeys, birds, reptiles, amphibians, birds, mammals, this entire Avatar on\nEarth world of rainforest that produces a fifth\nof the oxygen we breathe and the water we drink, this incredible thing. As far as I know, it's the most\ndirect way to protect that. And so the fact that, the fact that we've, you know, we have large funders\nwho give us, you know, $100,000 to protect\nthis huge swath of land. And that goes through things like this and through Instagram, it, you know, it goes directly to the\nlocal conservationists who work with the loggers\nto protect that land before it's cut. But one of the most impactful\nthings that has happened this year in the wake of\nour last conversation was that I got an email from\na mother and she said, \"You know, I'm a single\nmom and I work a few jobs and I can't afford to\ngive you a ton of money, but me and my kids look at your\nInstagram often after dinner and they really want to\nprotect the heartbeats. They really wanna protect the\nanimals and the rainforest. And so we do, we give $5\na month to Junglekeepers.\" And it was, to me that was so impactful because I used to be that little kid, worried about the animals. And I saw how a few million\nraindrops can create a flood. - Yeah, I ask that people donate to Junglekeepers. You guys are legit. That money's going to go a long way. Junglekeepers.org. If you somehow were able\nto raise very large, so the raindrops would make a waterfall, a very large amount of money. I don't know what that number is. Maybe $10 million, 20 million, 30 million, what are the\ndifferent milestones along the way that could really help, help you on the journey\nof saving the rainforest? - If we did, if let's just\nsay some company organization or if enough people donated it, let's just say we got that 30 million, that money would go directly\ninto stopping logging roads, into creating a corridor, a biological corridor that connects the uncontacted Indigenous\nreserves with other tribal lands, with Manu National Park,\nwith the Tambopata, which establishes essentially\nthe largest protected area in the Amazon rainforest. And what makes this groundbreaking is that we're not doing this\nin the traditional way. We're doing this, take it to the people. And that's what's been so\nexciting is that, you know, when he started this, when JJ started this 30 years ago, he had no idea. His father wanted him to be a logger. He didn't have shoes\nuntil he was 13 years old. He grew up bathing in the river. He had no idea that a bunch\nof crazy foreigner scientists were gonna show up and some guy in a James Bond suit was gonna come down here with microphones and that all of a sudden\nthe world would know that he was on this quest to protect this incredible ecosystem\nand all those little aliens. - Well, that's all the\nimportant thing to remember, that the people that are\ncutting down the forest, the loggers are also human\nbeings that have families. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- They're basically trying to survive and they're desperate and they're doing the thing\nthat will bring them money. And so they're just human beings. At the core of it, if\nthey have other options, they will probably\nchoose to give their life to saving the community, to first and foremost\nproviding for their family, and after that, saving the community, helping the community flourish. And I think probably a lot\nof them love the rainforest. They grew up in the rainforest. - Yeah, I mean, look at Pico. - [Lex] Yeah. - Pico used to be a logger, full-time logger, long-time logger. Now he loves conservation. He goes (speaks foreign language) (Lex laughs) He's like, you know?\n- Yeah. It's all about just\nproviding people options. There's some dark stuff on the gold mine stuff you've talked about. You showed me parts of the rainforest where the gold mines are and they're just kind of\nerasing the rainforest. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Sort of at the edges. That's when the mining happens and it's this ugly, ugly process of they're\njust destroying the jungle just for the surface layer of the sand or whatever that they process to collect just little bits of gold. And there's also very\ndark things that happen along the way as the communities\naround the gold mines are created so that the\nentirety of the moral system that emerges from that has\nthings like prostitution, where one third of the women that are drawn into that sex\ntrafficking, prostitution are minors under, you know,\nunder 17 years old, 13 to 17 year old. There's just a lot of\nreally, really dark stuff. - I think that we have a rare chance to do something\nagainst that darkness. I think that this is an example\nof local people who have taken action, done good work, been good to the people that have visited, harnessed a certain amount\nof international momentum. And now we're on the cusp\nof doing something historic. And so for the children in the\ncommunities along this river, it won't be being a\nprostitute in a gold mine. It'll be becoming a trained ranger. Like last month, our ranger coordinator and one of our female\nrangers went to Africa for a ranger conference. And it's like we're beginning to, this is someone from\na little, tiny village with thatched huts up river. She went to Africa to talk about being a professional conservation ranger. And it's like that's changing lives. And her daughters then, she's married to Ignacio, the guy. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- She, like her, their kids are gonna grow\nup seeing their parents walking around with the emblem on and go, \"Oh, I wanna\", and then\npeople like Pico and Pedro and all these guys that\nwork here are gonna go, \"Well, we have to protect this forest.\" And then they start getting\nfascinated about the snakes and then they start caring\nabout the turtle eggs and then all of a sudden\nthey have a way of life. And nobody needs to go be, nobody can, nobody needs to go steal anybody's kids to be a prostitute in a gold mine. That's horrible. And so it's really a, it's\na win-win for the animals, for the river, for the\nrainforest, for people. We're improving, it's\nbiocentric conservation. It's just making everything better. - Yeah, I've read in an article that said an estimated 1,200 girls\nbetween ages of 12 and 17 are forcibly drafted into child prostitution around the communities in the gold mines. At least one third of the prostitutes in the camp are underage. - Oh.\n- The girls had ended up in the camp after receiving a tip that there were restaurants\nlooking for waitresses and willing to pay top dollar. They jumped on a bus together and came down to the rainforest. What they found was not\nwhat they were expecting. The mining camp restaurants served food for only a few hours a day. The rest of the time it\nwas the girls themselves who were on the menu. Literally at the end of the road and without the money to return home, the girls would soon become\ntrapped in prostitution. - It's interesting to me that the most devastating destruction of nature, the complete erasure of the rainforest, burned to the ground, sucked through a hose, spit out into a disgusting mercury puddle, like the complete\nannihilation of life on Earth goes hand in hand with\nthe complete annihilation of a young life. It's like, it's all based\naround the same thing. It's the light versus the dark. That's, it's the destruction and the chaos versus a move towards order and hope and it is incredibly dark and this region is heavy with it. - Well, I'm glad you're\nfighting for the light."

      "text": "Is there like a milestone\nin the near future that you're working towards, like financially in terms of donations? - There is. In the next year and a half,\nas you saw in your time here, there's roads working around the Junglekeepers' concessions. All the work that the\nlocal people are doing to protect this land is\ntrying to be dismantled by international corporations that are subcontracting\nlogging companies here. And really what we need is $30\nmillion in the next two years to protect the whole thing. You've seen the ancient mahogany trees, you've seen the families of monkeys, you've seen the caiman in the river. All of this is standing in\nthe pathway of destruction. That road, they're gonna\ncome down that road and men with chainsaws\nare going to dismantle a forest that has been\ngrowing since the beginning. This is so magical. Do you see the snake over there? - Yeah.\n- [Paul] Do you? - There's a snake. - Okay, I'm just gonna, don't move. I don't want you to move. I'm gonna just, this is one of the most beautiful snakes in the Amazon rainforest. This is the blunt-headed tree snake. One of my favorite snakes. I've been hoping that you\nwould get to see this snake. I have been praying. - Oh boy. - Okay, okay, let's just go right back into this. Look at this little beauty creation. Let's keep you away from the fire. Look at this little blunt-headed tree snake. - [Lex] Wow.\n- Such an incredible. - [Lex] So tell me about this snake. - Harmless little snake. If you put your hand out, he'll probably just crawl onto your hand. Just be real careful with the fire. So look, I'm just gonna put\nhim like this and we're gonna yeah, let's just snake safety. So he's a tree snake. Yeah, nice and slow, nice\nand slow, nice and slow, so you nice and slow, just really slow. Just be the tree, be the\ntree that he climbs on. And this is like, again, this is a snake that's\nso thin and so small. There you go, there you go, nice and slow. Just be the tree, let him crawl around. So he is gonna try and do all this stuff. Let me see if I can just\ncalm him down for a sec. Lemme just see. He's very active little snake. So see, like the snake the other night, okay, just, gosh, look at this. I can see the light through his body. To me, this is an alien. This is this strange little life form. His eyes are two thirds of his head. I'm not joking, you look at their skull. - [Lex] He's so tiny.\n- He's so tiny. - For people listening, there's a snake in Paul's hands right now. It is very, it's long of course, but very skinny. - Very, very skinny.\n- [Lex] Very light. - And the also for everyone listening, the odds of that as we're sitting here doing this podcast, that a snake would just be\ncrawling by in the jungle might sound like something\nthat would happen but the density of snakes\nin the Amazon rainforest makes this a very unique experience. - Can you tell me a little bit\nabout the coloration scheme? - [Paul] Yeah, so.\n- A little bit brown. - Yeah just to describe this\nas we were talking here, it's just a sort of banded\nwhite and brown snake with this tiny, little head\nabout the size of my pinky nail. Two thirds of this snake's\neye, head is made up of its gigantic eyes. It's got a small mouth and it's about a third as thick as a pencil. It's basically a moving shoestring. It's incredibly, incredibly thin. The only thing I am thinking,\nLex, though, is that if we have Dan come and\njust do some shots of. - [Lex] Yeah, that's true.\n- Dan. - [Lex] So what are we looking at here? - The snake that was crawling\nbehind us in the jungle that I, we were talking\nabout Junglekeepers and what we could do. And this snake just\nshowed up at that moment. And this is a very active little snake who's out for a hunt tonight and wants to find something to eat. So this is a blunt-headed tree snake. Totally harmless, little, literally a moving shoestring. Super beautiful little animal. When you talk about aliens,\nto me this is an alien. Like, what are you thinking? What are you doing right now? What do you think about the\nfact that we are handled, being handled by these giant humans? - [Lex] And as you were saying,\nit reaches up to the leaves, you get closer.\n- Yeah, the snake just naturally knows to go, look. You just put 'em anywhere\nnear leaves and he is like, I got this. He just wants to go\nright up into that tree. I just want you to try holding him and real gentle just be the tree. Yeah, and just kind of do the same thing you learned last night,\njust nice and gentle. Yeah, and see he's holding\nonto my finger right now. He is just going up, there you go. Perfect, nice and easy. He's a little erratic,\nhe's a little goofy. - Maybe he's camera shy. Maybe a fan of the podcast and gigantic eyes\nrelative to his body size. - [Paul] Huge. - Oh, hello moth.\n- [Paul] Jeez. - Traffic, traffic in the jungle. - And then for everyone listening, as we're handling the snake that we found that was crawling by us, like literally by our shoulders, as we're talking, a bat flies through, no joke, eight inches from Lex's ear, like just zips past his head as he's holding a snake\nwhile we're sitting here in the jungle is just, we're just in it now. Now he is gonna try and back up. - And how do you.\n- [Paul] Yeah, why don't you, let's encourage him to come back this way. - He's weaved this way. - [Paul] He's okay, he's okay. He's just trying to back up. Yeah, right there, release. - Oh, release. - Okay I'm gonna, this\nis what I'm gonna do. We're gonna say thank you, Mr. Snake. - [Lex] Thank you, Mr. Snake. - Thank you, Mr. Snake. Back up into the tree. Here we go, there you go,\nthere you go, there you go. And then we can resume\nnormal podcasting now. (Lex laughs) 'Cause our.\n- [Lex] We really are in the jungle right now. - We really are in the jungle. That's one of my favorite snakes. That's one of my favorite\nlittle aliens on this planet. Look at that. - [Lex] And it's going on some\nlong journey that's gonna. - Up into the canopy. - Carry the rest of the night. So that little snake\nis one of the millions of life forms, heartbeats\nthat you're trying to protect. - Exactly. To me, I, after almost 20 years down here, the people here have become my friends, the caiman on the river, the monkeys. I, when I fall asleep at night, I think about all the\ndifferent heartbeats, all the different little creatures here that when they bulldoze this forest, when they chop down these\ntrees, that they vanish, that we take away their world. And in that very\nevolutionary, historical sense of remembering the primordial soup, it's like this, these,\nthis little creature surviving out here somehow. And we have the chance to save it. And even if you don't care\nabout the little creature on the pale blue dot, each of these little creatures contributes to this massive orchestral\nhole that creates climactic stability on this planet. And the Amazon is one of the\nmost important parts of that. And each of these little guys\nis playing a role in there."

      "section": "Uncontacted tribes",
      "text": "- So one of the other\nfascinating life forms is other humans, but living a\nvery different kind of life. So uncontacted tribes, what do you find most\nfascinating about them? - What I find most fascinating\nabout the uncontacted tribes is that while me and you are sitting here with microphones and a light, somewhere out there in that darkness, in that direction, not so\nfar away as the crow flies, there are people sitting\naround a fire in the dark, probably with little more than\na few leaves over their heads who don't even have\nthe use of stone tools, who only have metal\nobjects that they've stolen from nearby communities. They're living such primitive,\nisolated nomadic lives in the modern world, and they're still living\nnaked out in the jungle. It's truly incredible,\nit's truly remarkable. And I think that it's because they can't\nadvocate for themselves, they can't protect themselves,\nit's sort of like, well, we can let them get shot up by loggers and get their, let their land\nget bulldozed while they hide. They have no idea that their\nworld is being destroyed. But they're sort of the scariest and most fascinating\nthing out there right now in the jungle. - What do you think they're, 'cause you've spoken about\nthem being dangerous. What do you think their\nrelationship with violence is? - [Paul] I think there's.\n- Why is violence part of their approach\nto the external world? - So from the best I understand it, that at the turn of the\ncentury, industrial revolution, we had sudden immense need for rubber for hoses and gaskets and wires and tires and the war machine. And the only way to get\nrubber was to come down to the Amazon rainforest\nand get the local people who knew the jungle to\ngo out into the jungle and cut rubber trees\nand collect the latex. And Henry Ford tried doing Fordlandia, tried having rubber plantations, but leaf blight killed it. And so you had this period\nof horrendous extraction in the Amazon where the\nrubber barons were coming down and just raping and pillaging the tribes and making them go out to tap these trees. And the uncontacted tribes said no. They had their six foot long longbows, seven foot long arrows\nwith giant bamboo tips. And they moved further back\ninto the forest and they said, \"We will not be conquered.\" And since that time,\nthey've been out there and it's confusing because in a way, they're still running\nscared a century later. And their grandparents\nwould've told them, you know, the outside world, everyone\nyou see in the outside world is trying to kill you, so kill them first. So can you blame them for being violent? No. Is this river still wild because loggers were scared to go here? For a long time, for\nalmost a century late. That's why this forest is still here, yes. And so is it a human rights\nissue that we protect the last people on Earth\nthat have no government, no affiliation, no language\nthat we can explain? We don't know what their\nmedicinal plant knowledge is. We don't know their creation myths. We know nothing about them. And they're just out there\nright now with bows and arrows living in the dark,\nsurviving in the jungle, naked without even spoons. Forget about the wheel,\nforget about iPhones. They got nothing and\nthey're making it work. - We don't know their creation myths. So they have a very primitive existence. Well, do you think their values, first of all, do you think\ntheir nature is similar to ours? And how do their values differ from ours? - This is complicated because the anthropologist in me wants to say that they have a historical\nreason for the violent life that they have. You know, they experienced\nincredible generational trauma some time ago. And that, and because\nthey've been living isolated in the jungle, that has permeated\nto become their culture. They've become a culture of violence. But yet the contacted,\nmodern Indigenous communities that we work with, that are\nmy friends that work here, just the other day we were\nspeaking to one of them who was pulling spikes out of your hand while he was explaining\nthat he tried to help them. The brothers, (speaks foreign language), he tried to help them. He tried to give them a gift. And what did they do? They shot him in the head. - Yeah, he said, \"They're our brothers.\" And he tried to give them a bananas.\n- [Paul] Mm-hmm, plantains. - Plantains, boat full of plantains. And they shot at him. - They shot three arrows at him and one of them actually\nhit him in the skull and put him in the hospital, and he got helicopter\nevacuated from his community. And so he's brave for surviving, but he's a lucky survivor. They are incredibly accurate with those bamboo-tipped arrows and those arrows are seven feet long. So when you get hit by one, they come at a velocity\nthat can rip through you. And the range on a shotgun is way shorter than the range on a longbow. You're talking about a couple\nhundred meters on a longbow. And they're deadly accurate. They can take spider\nmonkeys out of a tree. And so there's stories of loggers, and I've seen the photos\nof the bodies of loggers who attract, who attacked\none of the tribes. And the tribes hadn't done anything but these loggers came around a bend, they started shooting\nshotguns at the tribe, and the tribes scattered into the forest. And as the loggers'\nboat went around a bend, they just started flying arrows, took out the boat driver,\nboat skidded to the side and then everybody was\nstanding in the river and you can't run. And the tribe just descended on them and just porcupined them full of arrows. - Shotgun versus bow. There's a shotgun shell here, by the way. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- From the loggers. - Mm-hmm, yeah, we\npicked that up yesterday. Was that yesterday? - That was, I don't know. - [Paul] I don't know, I think it was yesterday.\n- One of the things that happens here is time loses meaning in some kind of deep way that it does when you're in a big\ncity in the United States, for example, and there's\nschedules and meetings and all this kind of stuff. It transforms the meaning,\nyour experience of time, your interaction with time,\nthe role of time, all of this. I've forgotten time and I've forgotten the\nexistence of the outside world. - And how does that feel? - It feels more honest. It also puts in perspective\nlike all the busyness, all the, it kind of takes the ant out\nof the ant colony and says, \"Hey, this, you're just an ant and this is just an ant colony. And there's a big world out there.\" Yeah, it's a chance to be grateful, to celebrate this Earth of ours and the things that\nmake it worth living on, including the simple things that make the individual life worth\nliving, which is water, and then food and the\nrest is just details. Of course, the friendships\nand social interaction. That's a really big one, actually. That one I'm taking for granted 'cause I didn't get a chance\nyet to really spend time alone. - [Paul] Hmm.\n- And when I came here, I've gotten a chance to hang out with you. And there's a kind of camaraderie, there's a friendship there\nthat if that's broken, that's a tough one too. And you spent quite a lot\nof time alone in the jungle. You ever get alone out here? - Yeah, yeah. I mean, the first 15\nyears we were doing this, we, there would be times that JJ would be busy in town with his family. And I would, for sheer\nlove of the rainforest, I would have to come alone out here. And we didn't have running, I didn't have running\nwater, I didn't have lights. All I had was a couple of\ncandles in the darkness and a tent and I was\n20-something years old, living in the Amazon by myself. Your boat sunk. And yeah, it's incredibly lonely. I had to learn through experience 'cause I thought there was a period, I think when you're,\nyou know, you're young, as a young man, I had this thing like I wanted to prove that I\ncould be like the explorers. I wanted to prove that I\ncould handle the elements, that I could go out alone, that I could have these\ndeep, connective moments with the jungle. And it's like, I did\nthat and that's great. And you know what the kid\nfrom \"Into the Wild\" learned right before he died in that bus? That if you don't have\nsomebody to share it with, it doesn't matter. - But on some kind of like, even just deep, human level, like even if you have\nsomebody to share it with, you ever just get alone out here? Just like this sense of\nlike existential dread of like what, you know, the jungle has a way of not caring about any individual organism because it just kinda turns, it's like, it makes you realize that life is finite quite intensely. - Hmm. For me, it's comforting being out here 'cause I find the rat race,\nthe national narrative, the need to make money,\nthe, to worry about war, to be outraged about the newest thing that that politician said\nand what that actor did, and it just, there's always\njust this just unending sort of media storm. And everyone's worried and\neveryone's trying to optimize their sunlight exposure\nand find the solution and buy the right, new thing. And to me coming out here, first of all, I mean something out here 'cause I can help someone. I can help people, I\ncan help these animals. And so I find my meaning out here. But also, you know, there's\nthe losing the madness over the mountains. It's nature has always\nand for many people been where things make sense. And to me, I think I'm a\nsimple analog type of person that it makes sense that when it rains, you get in the river to\nstay warm and you know, you wait for the dawn and\nyou see a little tree snake and you see it just, it makes more sense. And I think that the\noverwhelming, teeming complexity that is inside the ant\nmound of society can be dizzying for some people. And I think that maybe it's the dyslexia, maybe it's just that I love nature. But now if I, when I land in JFK, I feel like a frightened animal on like a. (Lex laughs) It is as if you released like a, some animal that had\nnever seen it onto like, into Times Square. And you could just imagine\nthis dog with its ears back running away from taxis and\njust cowering from the noise. And it's just hustle and\nbustle and people are brutal. And how much you want it for,\nget in the car, you know? Screaming over the intercom\nand just everything, everything sensory changes. And let's get home, okay, let's go. You got a meeting, you\ngotta get to the next place. You gotta give a talk, you gotta sign. Out here, when we finish up\nhere, what are we gonna do? We're gonna eat some food,\nmaybe go catch a crocodile. (Lex laughs) Go walk around the jungle at night. Like it's slower, it makes sense. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And there's that again, there's that deep meaning of that here, where we can be the guardians for good. We can be, we can hold that candle up and know for sure that\nwe're protecting the trees from being destroyed. And it's that simple thing\nof just, this is good. There you go.\n- [Lex] It's simple. - In society, I feel like everyone's always losing their minds and forgetting the most basic of fundamental truths. And out here, you can't\nreally argue with them. You know, when we needed\nwater, it was like shit, if we don't get water, we're fucked. And that's to me, that's where\nthe camaraderie comes from. Because no matter what, we'll be, we could go to the most\nfancy ass restaurant through the biggest, most\nfamous people in the world. Doesn't matter, we still\nremember what it was like standing around in the jungle going, \"Fuck, we're scared and\nwe don't have water.\" We got reduced to the\nsimplest form of humans. And that's something. And we survived, and that's cool. - And you take all the, all those people in their nice dresses in those fancy restaurants\nand you put them in those conditions, they're all gonna want the\nsame thing, just water and. - Yes.\n- [Lex] It's all the same thing.\n- All the beautiful people."

I mean, he, that guy was full of joy. - If I have a percentage of\nSteve Irwin, I would be honored. But that guy, I think\nthere's only one Steve. I think that he was, he occupied his own strata\nof just shining light. Everything was positive, enthusiasm, love and happiness, and save the animals and do better and let's make it fun. And that was so infectious\nthat it sort of transcended his TV show. It transcended his conservation work. It transcended business\nand entrepreneurship.

So if anybody, you know,\nmakes that comparison, I get really uncomfortable because to me, Steve Irwin is like just the GOAT. And so I'm okay with that. - Well, I at least agree\nwith that comparison. Having spent time with you, there's just an eternal flame of joy and adventure too, just pulling you. A dark question, but do\nyou think you might meet the same end, giving your life in some\nway to something you love? - That is a dark question, but I think most likely\nI'll get whacked by loggers.

I don't picture myself\ngoing from animals, but. - That would be heartbreaking too. - Yeah, it would but yeah,\nat the same time though, like the Kurt Cobain value of that, if I died doing what I\nlove, to protect the river, that'd be so worth so much more. A lot, like we'd get the 30\nmillion if I died tomorrow, for sure. So we've already talked\nabout this with my friends. I'm like, if I get whacked.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Do the foundation, make the documentary, protect the river, protect the heartbeats. Call it \"The Heartbeats\", \"Junglekeepers: the Heartbeats\", you know? Be ready for it because\nthese things do happen. People get pissed if you get in their way and as many happy people as\nand whose lives we're changing, there's also gonna be some\njealous, shitty, upset people who are mad that they\ncan't make prostitutes out of young girls and\nkeep destroying the planet. And so they might just erase you. Me. - Well, I hope you, like a Clint Eastwood character,\njust impossible to kill. - I hope so. - I like how you squinted your eyes. (Paul and Lex laugh) On cue. Who do you think will play you in a movie? - God, somebody with the right nose. - Yeah. - Somebody who can live\nup to this (indistinct). - Yeah, all right, Italian.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - It's funny. Do you think of yourself as\nItalian or human, American? - That's the thing I don't, you know, my life has been the\nUnited Nations of whatever. Like I just, every, to\nme, I just, I don't, that's the other thing. You go back to society and\neveryone's obsessed with race. To me, I'm like, look,\nleopards have black babies and yellow babies, one mother,\nlike, they're all leopards. And I'm so colorblind and race\nblind and everything else. I've lived in India. My friends are Peruvian. My family, we got Italian,\nFilipino, just everything. And so I've, I'm so immersed in it that when I find it very\njarring and disconcerting how much time we spend talking\nabout different religions and just the differences in humans. I'm like, dude, we're\ntalking about whether or not our ecosystems are gonna\nbe able to provide for us. We're talking about nuclear, what we're talking about\nthis some pretty serious shit on the table. And we're over here arguing\nover like shades of gray of, it's so trivial.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And that shit drives me crazy. And as does the outrage\nwhere it's like, no, you have to care. I've been criticized for not\ncaring enough about that. And I'm like, I'm gonna, who cares what the hell I am? Who gives a shit, what the hell? I'm a human, we're all human.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It's not that easy, but\nit's kind of fun sometimes. And we're at a better time and hit like when you think\nabout like the Middle Ages, like even if you were a king, you still didn't have it that good. You didn't have pineapples in the winter. You didn't even know what\nthe fuck a pineapple was. We have pineapples whenever we want them. We can fly on planes to other countries. - By the way, let's clarify. We, you mean a large\nfraction of the world. You know, I mentioned to you\none of the biggest things I've noticed when I immigrated\nfrom the Soviet Union to the United States is the how plentiful bananas and pineapples were. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- The fruit section, the produce section of the, didn't have to wait in\nline at the grocery store, could just eat as many\nbananas and pineapples and cherries and watermelon as you want. That's, not everybody has that. - No, that's true, not\neverybody has that, but. - But everybody could be\nthat king now, pineapple. - But a growing number of people today. - Can feast on pineapple. - Can feast on pineapple and have toasters and new, distracting apps\nall the way until the grave. - That's the thing that I also noticed is I don't think so much about\npolitics when I'm here, or. - We haven't even talked about it. - We haven't, don't talk about the stupid differences between humans. - [Paul] Nah.\n- Except to just kind of laugh at the absurdity of it on occasion. - I've been too busy\ntrying to survive glaciers and jungles and avalanches\nand all kinds of shit. - Do you think nature is brutal as Warner Herzog showed it? Or is it beautiful? - I think the brutality\nof nature is the chaos. And I think that we\nare the only ones in it that are capable of organizing in the direction of order and light. So yes, there are gonna be\nhyenas tearing each other apart. Yes, there's gonna be war-torn nations and poor, starving children, but we as humans have the power to work towards something\nmore organized than that. - So there is a force within nature that's always searching\nfor order, for good. - It's kind of a unifying\ntheory if you think about it. I mean, all of the chaos of history and the wars and the chaos of nature, we, through technology and organization, there's so many people, more people today than ever before I think who are so concerned, who realize that the incredible power, like what Jane Goodall\nsays about, you know, how you can affect the people around you, how you can do good in the world, how you can change the\nnarrative of conservation from one of loss and darkness to one of innovation and light. Like, we can do incredible things. We are the masters as humans. And I think that we're at, on the cusp of sort of understanding the true potential of that. Like I just think that\nmore than ever, people, people have harnessed this\nability to do good in the world and be proud of it and just change the darkness into something else."

Who is God? - I've come to believe that, again, back to that Christ wasn't a Christian, Muhammad wasn't a Muslim,\nand Buddha wasn't a Buddhist. That like the game, the game is love and compassion and the universe is chaotic and dangerous and nature is chaotic and dangerous. But we, if this is some sort\nof a biological video game, that our reality, that the test is can we be good? And we go through it every day. Can you be good to your parent? Can you be good to your partner? Can you be good to your coworkers? Can, it's so difficult. And we see how people can cheat and steal and hurt and destroy and the incredible impact\nthat it has on the world, the returning, exponential impact that one act of kindness,\none act of good can do. And so I see nature as God. I see the religions as different\ncultural manifestations of the same truth, the same creative force. Maybe me and you have the same beliefs and your aliens are my angels. - Well, thank you for being one of the humans trying\nto do good in this world. And thank you for bringing\nme along for some adventure and I believe more adventure awaits. - Thank you for being\nenough of a psychopath to actually just sign on to\ncome into the Amazon rainforest in a suit. And a year ago when you told\nme that you were gonna do this, I truly didn't believe you. So for being a man of your word and for the incredible work\nyou do to connect humans and to create dialogue and\nto do good in the world and for all the adventures that we've had, thank you so much. - Thank you, brother. - Lex, thanks man. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Paul Rosolie. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Joseph Campbell. The big question is whether\nyou are going to be able to say a hearty yes to your adventure. Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."

  "full_text": "- Where are we right now, Paul? - Lex, we are in the middle of nowhere. - [Lex] It's the Amazon jungle. There's vegetation, there's insects, there's all kinds of creatures. A million heartbeats, a million eyes. So really, where are we right now? - [Paul] We are in Peru, in a very remote part of\nthe Western Amazon basin. And because of the proximity of the (indistinct) cloud forest to the lowland tropical rainforest, we are in the most biodiverse\npart of planet Earth. There's more life per square\nacre, per square mile out here than there is anywhere else on Earth, not just now, but in the\nentire fossil record. - The following is a\nconversation with Paul Rosolie, his second time on the podcast. But this time we did the conversation\ndeep in the Amazon jungle. I traveled there to hang out with Paul and it turned out to be an\nadventure of a lifetime. I'll post a video capturing some aspects of that\nadventure in a week or so. It included everything from getting lost in dense, unexplored wilderness with no contact to the outside world, to taking very high doses of ayahuasca and much more. Paul, by the way, aside from being my good friend, is a naturalist, explorer, author, and is someone who has dedicated his life to protecting the rainforest. For this mission, he\nfounded Junglekeepers. You can help him if you\ngo to junglekeepers.org. This trip for me was life-changing. It expanded my understanding of myself and of the beautiful world\nI'm fortunate to exist in with all of you. So I'm glad I went and I'm glad I made it out alive. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Paul Rosolie. I can't believe we're actually here. - I can't believe you actually came. - And I can't believe you\nforced me to wear a suit. (Paul laughs) - That was the people's choice, trust me. - All right, we've been through quite a lot over the last few days. - We've been through a bit. - Let me ask you a ridiculous question. What of all the creatures right now if they wanted to, could cause us harm? - The thing is, the Amazon\nrainforest has been described as the greatest natural\nbattlefield on Earth because there's more life\nhere than anywhere else, which means that everything\nhere is fighting for survival. The trees are fighting for sunlight, the animals are fighting for prey. Everybody's fighting for survival. And so everything that you see here, everything around us\nwill be killed, eaten, digested, recycled at some point. The jungle is really just a\ngiant churning machine of death. And life is kind of this moment of stasis where you maintain this\ncollection of cells in a particular DNA sequence and then it gets digested\nagain and recycled back and renamed into everything. And so the things in this forest, while they don't want to hurt us, there are things that are heavily defended because, for instance,\na giant anteater needs claws to fight off a jaguar. A stingray needs a stinger on its tail, which is basically a serrated\nknife with venom on it to deter anything that\nwould hunt that stingray. Even the catfish have pectoral fins that have razor, long steak\nknife-sized defense systems. Then you have of course the jaguars, the harpy eagles, the piranha, the candiru fish that can swim up a penis, lodge themselves inside. It's the Amazon rainforest. The thing is, as you've learned this week, nothing here wants to get us, with the exception of maybe mosquitoes. Every other animal just wants to eat and exist in peace. That's it. - But there is, each of those\nanimals, like you described, have a kind of radius of defense. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- So if you accidentally step into its home. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Into that radius, it can cause harm. - Or make 'em feel threatened. - Make 'em feel threatened. There is a defense\nmechanism that is activated. - Some incredible defense mechanisms. I mean, you're talking about\n17-foot black caiman crocodiles that with significant size\nthat could rip you in half. Anacondas, the largest snake on Earth. Bushmasters that can grow up to be nine to I think even 11 feet long. And I've caught bushmasters\nthat are thicker than my arms. - So for people who don't\nknow bushmaster snakes, what are these things? - These are vipers. It's the, I believe it's\nthe largest viper on Earth. - Venomous?\n- Extremely venomous with hinged teeth, tissue-destroying venom. Like, if you get bitten by a bushmaster, they say you don't rush and try and save your own life. You try to savor what's around you. Look at, look around at the world, smoke your last cigarette,\ncall your mom, that's it. - So that moment of stasis that is life is going to end abruptly when you interact with one of those. - Yeah, I even have, even this seemingly. - Can I just pause at how\nincredibly beautiful it is that you could just reach to your right and grab a piece of the jungle. (Lex and Paul laugh) - It's like a, even this seemingly beautiful little fern, if you go this way on\nthe fern, you're fine. As soon as, ow, as soon\nas you go this way, there's invisible, little\nspikes on there if you wanna. - Oh, I see, I feel that. - Yeah, see that? It's like everything is defended. If you're driving on the road and you have your arm out the side, or if you're on a motorcycle\ngoing through the jungle and you get one of these, it'll just tear all the\nskin right off your body. It's kind of doing that to me now. - So what would you do? Like, we were going through\nthe dense jungle yesterday and you slide down the\nhill, your foot slips, you're sliding down.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - And then you find yourself staring a couple feet away from\na bushmaster snake. What are you doing? You're, for people who somehow don't know, are somebody who loves, admires snakes, who has met thousands of snakes, has worked with them, respects them, celebrates them. What would you do with a\nbushmaster snake face to face? - Face to face, this has happened, that I've been there. - It's nice. - I've come face to face with a bushmaster and there's two things, there's two reactions that you might get. One is if the bushmaster\ndecides that it's vacation time, if it's sleeping, if he just had a meal, they'll come to the edges of trails or beneath a tree and\nthey'll just circle up, little spiral, big spiral, big pile of snake on the trail\nand they'll just sit there. And one time there was a snake sitting on the side of a trail\nbeneath a tree for two weeks. This snake was just sitting there resting, digesting its food out\nin the open, in the rain, in the sun, in the night. Didn't matter, you go near it,\nbarely even cracked a tongue. Now the other option is\nthat you get a bushmaster that's alert and hunting and out looking for something to eat and they're ready to defend themselves. And so I once came across a bushmaster in the jungle at night, and this bushmaster turned\nits head towards me, looked at me and made it very clear, I'm gonna go this way. And so I did the natural thing that any snake enthusiast would do, and I grabbed its tail. Now, 11 feet later by the head, the snake turned around and just said if you wanna meet God, I\ncan arrange the meeting. I will oblige. And I decided to let the bushmaster go. And so it's like that with most animals. You know, a jaguar will\nturn and look at you and just remind you of how small you are. - Like, what did you\nsee in the snake's eyes? What, how did you sense\nthat this is not the right, this is not, this is gonna\nbe your end if you proceed? - His readiness. I wanted to get him by the tail and show him to the people that were there and maybe work with\nthe snake a little bit. As an 11-foot snake, he,\nthe snake turned around and made it very clear,\nlike not today, pal. It's not gonna happen. - It was in the eyes and the movement and the tension of the body? - It was the movement. It was the movement and the S of the neck. It was as if you pushed me and I went, \"Let's go, make my day.\"\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Like, he just looked a little bit too. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Too ready. (Lex laughs) He's like, I love this. - [Lex] Okay, all right, so you know. - You just know, you just know. Whereas like the snake you met last night. - [Lex] Yeah, beautiful snake. - Such a calm little thing. He just focuses on eating baby lizards and little snails and things. And that snake has no\nconcept of defending itself. It has no way to defend itself. So even a, even something\nthe size of a blue jay could just come and just\npeck that thing in the head and swallow it. And it's a helpless, little snake. So it's really, it kind\nof depends on the animal. It depends on the mood you catch 'em in. Each one has a different temperament. - The grace of its movement was\nmesmerizing, curious almost. Maybe I'm anthropomorphizing,\nprojecting onto it, but it was.\n- The tongue flicking was a sign of curiosity. It was trying to figure\nout what was going on. It was like, why am I on\nthis treadmill of human skin, you know? They're just trying to\nget to the next thing. Trying to get hidden, trying\nto get away from the light. - Also, the texture of the\nscales is really fascinating. I mean, it's my first.\n- Oh, that's right. - The first snake I've ever\ntouched is so interesting. It was just such an incredible system of muscles that are all\ninteracting together to make that kind of movement work and all the texture of\nits skin, of its scales. What do you love about snakes? From my first experience with a snake to all the thousands of\nexperiences you had with snakes, what do you love about these creatures? - I think it's, when you\njust spoke about it it was, that's the first snake you've met. And it was a tiny, little\nsnake in the jungle and you spoke about it with\nso much light in your eyes. And I think that because\nwe've been programmed to be scared of snakes, there's something wondrous\nthat happens in our brain. Maybe it's just this joy of discovery, that there's nothing to be scared of. And whether it's a\nrattlesnake that is dangerous and that you need to give distance to, but you look at it from a\ndistance and you go, whoa. Or it's a harmless little grass snake that you can pick up and\nenjoy and give to a child. It's, they're just these\nstrange, legless animals that just exist. You know, they don't even have eyelids. They're so different than us. They have a tongue that senses the air and they, to me, are so beautiful. And I've my whole life been\ndefending snakes from humans. And it's, they seem misunderstood. I think they're incredibly beautiful. There's every color and variety of snakes. There's venomous snakes,\nthere's tree snakes, there's huge, crushing anacondas. It's just, of the 2,600 species of snakes that exist on Earth, there's just such beauty, such complexity and such simplicity. They're just, to me, I'm, I feel like I'm friend with snake and they rely on me to\nprotect them from my people. - Friend with snake. - Me friend snake. - Me friend snake. You said some of them\nare sometimes aggressive, some of them are peaceful. Is this a mood thing, a\npersonality thing, a species thing? Is it, what is it? - So the, as far as I know, there's only really two snakes on Earth that could be aggressive 'cause aggression indicates offense. And so a reticulated\npython has been documented as eating humans. Anacondas, although while\nit hasn't been publicized, they have eaten humans. Every single other snake from\nboa constrictor to bushmaster, to spitting cobra to grass snake to garter snake to everything else, every single other snake does\nnot want to interact with you. They have no interest. So there's no such thing\nas an aggressive snake once you get outside of\nanaconda and reticulated python. Aggression could be trying\nto eat you, that's predation. But for every other snake, a rattlesnake, if it was there, would either\ngo escape and hide itself, or it would rattle its tail\nand tell us don't come closer. A cobra will hood up and\nbegin to hiss and say, \"Don't approach me. I'm asking you nicely\nnot to mess with me.\" And most other snakes are\nfast or they stay in the trees or they're extremely camouflaged. But their whole MO is\njust don't bother me. I don't wanna be seen, I\ndon't wanna be messed with. In fact, all I wanna do is be left alone. And once in a while, I just want to eat. And by the way, when\nyou see a snake drink, your heart will break. It's like seeing, it's the only thing that's cuter than a puppy. Like, watching a snake\ntouch its mouth to water and just, you just see\nthat little mouth going as they suck water in. And it's like, it's just so adorable, watching this scaled animal\njust be like, I need water. - In a state of vulnerability. - [Paul] Yeah, yeah.\n- Bro, there's nothing cuter than a little puppy with a tongue like. (Lex slurps tongue) - Baby ball python.\n- [Lex] Right. - Baby king cobra, man, come on. - I'll have to take your word for it. (Lex laughs) - [Paul] Baby elephant. - So what are, they're like at a puddle\nand they just take it in? - They can be at a puddle\nand they just take it in. Or one time in India, I\nwas with a snake rescuer and we found this nine-foot king cobra, this god of a snake. They're Ophiophagus hannah\nis their Latin name, and they're snake eaters. They're the king of the snakes,\nthe largest venomous snake. And the people that\ncalled the snake rescuer, 'cause that's a profession in India, you know, it had gotten into their kitchen or their backyard. And so we showed up and we got the snake. And the snake rescuer, he knew, he looked at the snake and\nhe went to me, he said, \"You know, why do you think\nthis snake would go in a house?\" And he was quizzing me. And I actually went,\n\"You know, I don't know, is it warm, is it cold?\" You know, like sometimes\ncats like to go into the warm cars in the winter. And he was like, \"He's thirsty.\" He goes, \"Watch this.\" He took a water bottle,\npoured it over the, now the snake is standing up. The snake stands up three feet tall. This is a huge king cobra with a hood, terrifying snake to be around. He leans over to the snake and the snake is standing\nthere trusting him. And he takes a water bottle and pours it onto the snake's nose. And the snake turns up its nose and just starts drinking\nfrom the water bottle. Human giving water to\nsnake, big, scary snake. But this human understood\nsnake gets water, snake gets released in\njungle, everybody's okay. - So sometimes the needs are simple, they just don't have the words to communicate them to us humans. - Yeah. - And is it disinterest or is it fear, almost like they don't notice us? Or is it we're a source, the unknown aspect of it, the uncertainty is a source of danger? - Well, animals live in a\nconstant state of danger. Like if you look at that\ndeer that we saw last night, it's stalking through the jungle, wondering what's going to eat it, Wondering if this is the last\nmoment it's gonna be alive. It's like animals are\nconstantly terrified of that this is their last moment. - Yeah, just for the listener, we're walking through\nthe jungle late at night, so it's darkness except our headlamps on. And then all of a sudden, Paul stops. He's like, \"Shh,\" and he looks in the distance\nand he sees two eyes. He's, I think you thought is that a jaguar or is that a deer? And it was moving its head like this, like scared or maybe trying to figure it, trying to localize itself,\ntrying to figure out. - Trying to see around you. - You're doing the same to it, the two of you like moving your head. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And like deep into the jungle, like, I don't know. It's pretty far away through the trees you could still see it. It was fascinating.\n- 30 feet or so, yeah. - That's the thing to actually mention. I mean the, with headlamp you see the reflection in their eyes. It's kind of incredible.\n- [Paul] Yes. - Just to see a creature, to try to identify a creature by just the reflection from its eyes. - Yeah, and so the cats, sometimes you'll get like\na greenish or a bluish glow from the cats. The deer are usually white to orange, caiman, orange, nightjars, orange, snakes can usually be like orange, moths, spiders sparkle. And so you have all these different, as you walk through the jungle, you can see all these different eyes. And when something large looks\nat you like that deer did, your first thing is what animal is this that I am staring back at? 'Cause through the light you kind of get, you see the reflection off the\nbright light off the leaves. And I couldn't tell at\nfirst 'cause I actually, the, those big, bright eyes,\nit could have been an ocelot, it could have been a jaguar,\nit could have been a deer. And then when it did this movement, that's what the cats do. They try to see around your light. I thought maybe Lex Fridman's\nhere, we're gonna get lucky. It's gonna be a jag right off trail. - Your definition of lucky\nis a complicated one. - Yeah.\n- That's a fascinating process when you see those two eyes\ntry to figure out what it is. And it is trying to figure out\nwhat you are in that process. Let's talk about caiman.\n- [Paul] Sure. - We've seen a lot of\ndifferent kinds of size. We've seen a baby one, a bigger one. Tell me about these\n16-foot plus apex predators of the Amazon rainforest. - The big, bad, black caiman, which is the largest reptilian\npredator in the Amazon except for the anaconda, they kind of both share\nthat notch of apex predator. They were actually hunted\nto endangered species level in the '70s 'cause their leather, black, scale leather. But they're coming back. They're coming back and they're huge and they're beautiful. And I was walking near a\nlake and I never understood how big they could get\nexcept for I was walking near a lake last year and\nI was following the stream, you know, and it's like\nwhen you're following a little stream and there's\njust a little trickle of water, and all of a sudden this\nriver otter had been running the other direction on\nthe tree, on the stream. River otter comes up to\nme and I swear to God, this animal looked at me and went, \"Hey.\" And I went, \"Hey.\" He was like, didn't\nexpect to see me there. And he turned around, he\nlike did a little spin, started running down the stream. Then he turned around\nand he, you could tell, he was like, \"Let's go.\" And I, you know, I'm not\nanthropomorphizing here. The animal was asking me to come with him. So I followed the river\notter down the stream. We started running down the stream and the river otter looks\nat me one more time, is like, \"Yo\", jumps into the lake. And I'm like, what does he want me to see? Now in the lake, this\nriver otter is doing dives and freaking out and going\nup and down and up and down and they're very excited. They're screaming, they're screeching. All of a sudden, and I've\nnever seen anything like this except for in like \"Game of Thrones\", this croc head comes\nflying out of the water. All of the river otters were attacking this huge, black caiman, 16 feet. - [Lex] Wow.\n- Head half the size of this table. And she was thrashing her tail around, creating these huge waves in the water, trying to catch an otter,\nand they're so fast. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- That they were zipping around her, biting\nher and then going around. And this otter, swear\nto God, interspecies, looked at me and went, \"Watch this.\" (Lex laughs) We're fucking with this caiman. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It was amazing. And I, for the first time, I got to stand there\nwatching this incredible interspecies fight happening. They weren't trying to kill the caiman, they were just trying to mess with it. And the caiman was doing his best to try and kill these otters. And they were just having a good time in that sick, sort of\nhyper-intelligent animal, like wolf sort of way\nwhere they were just going, you can't catch us. - Yeah, like intelligence and agility versus like raw power and dominance. I mean, I got to handle\nsome smaller caiman and just the power they had. You know, you scale that up to imagine what a 16-foot, even a 10-foot, any kind of black caiman, the kind of power they deliver. Maybe can you talk to that? Like, the power they can\ngenerate with their tail, with their neck, with their jaw. - Yeah, alligators and\ncaiman and crocodiles have some of the strongest\nbite forces on Earth. Think a saltwater crocodile wins as the strongest bite force on Earth. And you got to hold about a foot, was it a four-foot spectacled caiman? And you got to feel, I mean, you're a black belt in jiu-jitsu. How do you compare the\nexplosive force you felt from that animal compared to\nwhat a human can generate? - It's difficult to describe in words. There's a lot of power. And we're talking about\nthe power of the neck, like the, what is it? I mean, there's a lot. It could generate power\nall up and down the body. So probably the tail is a monster, but just the neck and, you know, not to mention the\npower of the bite, that, and the speed too. Because the thing I saw\nand got to experience is how still and calm, at least from my amateur perspective. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- It seems calm, still. And then from that sort of\nzero to 60 could just go wild. - Just thrashing. - And then there's also\na decision it makes in that split second\nwhether, as it thrashes, is it going to kinda bite\nyou on the way or not? - Hmm and that's where, that's where of the four species of caiman that we have here, you see differences in their\npersonalities as a species. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And so you can like, just like you know like generally, Golden Retrievers are viewed\nas a friendly dog, generally. Not every single one\nof them, but as a rule. Spectacled caiman, puppies. You released one in the\nriver and it did nothing. It didn't bite one of your\nfingers, it just swam away. We dropped one in the\nriver and what did it do? It chose peace. Now I had a smooth-fronted\ncaiman a few weeks ago, and this was probably about\na three and a half footer. Not big enough to kill you, but very much big enough\nto grab one of your fingers and just shake it off your body, just death roll it right off. And as I was being careful, totally different caiman than\nthe one that you got to see. This one has spikes coming off it. They're like leftover dinosaurs. It's like they evolved\nduring the dinosaur times and never changed. They have spikes and bony plates and all kinds of strange\ngrowths that you don't see on the other, smoother caiman. And I tried to release this\none without getting bitten and I threw it into the\nstream, gently into the water, just went wow and tried\nto pull my hands back. And as I pulled my hand back, this caiman in the air turned around and just tried to gimme one parting blow and just got one tooth, whack, right to the bone of my finger. And bone injury feels\ndifferent than a skin injury. So you instantly, and\nit just reminds you of, that's a caiman with a head this big. And it hurt. And I know that it could\nhave taken off my finger. Now if you scale that\nup to a black caiman, it's rib crushing. It's zebra head-removing size, you know? Just meat destroying. It's nature's metal sort of, you know, just raw power. - So what's the biggest croc\nyou've been able to handle? - We were doing caiman surveys for years and we would go out at night\nand you want to figure out what are the populations of\nblack caiman, spectacled caiman, smooth-fronted caiman, dwarf caiman. And the only way to see which\ncaiman you're dealing with is to catch it 'cause a lot of times, you get up close with the light and you can see the eyes at night, but you can't quite\nsee what species it is. For instance, this past\nfew months we found two baby black caiman on the river, which is unprecedented here. We haven't seen that in decades. So it's important that we\nmonitor our croc population. So I started catching small ones. In \"Mother of God\", I\nwrite about the first one that me and JJ caught together, which was probably a little\nbigger than this table. And probably mid-20s\nbravado and competition with other young males of my species led to me trying to go as big as I could. And I jumped on a spectacled caiman that was slightly longer than I am. And I'm 5'9\", so I jumped on this probably six foot croc\nand quickly realized that my hands couldn't get around its neck and my legs were wrapped\naround the base of its tail. And the thrash was so intense\nthat as it took me one side, I barely had enough time to\nrealize what was happening before it beat me against the ground. My headlamp came off, so now I'm blind, in the dark, laying in a river in\nthe Amazon rainforest, hugging a six-foot crocodile. And I went, \"JJ\". (Lex laughs) As I always do. But I, in that moment,\nbefore I even let go, I knew I couldn't let go of the croc because if I let go of the croc, I thought she was gonna destroy my face. So I said, \"Okay, now I'm stuck here. If I just stay here, I can't release her. I need help.\" But I was like, I'm never\never, ever, ever gonna try and solo catch a croc this big again. I was like, this is, I knew\nin that moment I was like, this is good enough. - So anything longer than you. - [Paul] No.\n- You don't control the tail. You don't have, you have barely\ncontrol of anything, really. - Yeah, and that's a spectacled caiman. A black caiman is a whole\nother order of magnitude there. It's like saying like, oh, you know, I was play fighting\nwith my Golden Retriever versus I was play fighting\nwith like, you know, what's the biggest, scariest\ndog you could think of? The dog from Sandlot, a\ngiant, gorilla dog thing. Like a Malamute something, something huge. What do they call, Mastiffs? - Yeah, Mastiffs.\n- [Paul] Mastiffs. - I mean, you mentioned dinosaurs. What do you admire about black caiman? What, they've been here\nfor a very, very long time. There's something prehistoric\nabout their appearance, about their way of being, about their presence in this jungle. - With crocodiles, you're\nlooking at this mega survivor. They're in a class with sharks where it's like they've been here so long. When you talk about multiple extinctions, you talk about the Sixth Extinction, Earth's going through all this stuff. The crocodiles and the cockroaches\nhave seen it all before. They're like, man, we remember\nwhat that comet looked like. And they're not impressed. - Yeah, they have this,\nthey carry this wisdom. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- In their power. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- In the simplicity of their power, they carry the wisdom. - Yeah, and they're just\nsitting there in the streams and they don't care. And even if there's a nuclear holocaust, you know that there would just\nbe some crocs sitting there, dead-eyed in that stagnant water waiting for the life to regenerate\nso they could eat again. - It's gonna be the remaining humans versus the crocs and the cockroaches. And the cockroaches are\njust background noise. - Yeah, they'll always be there. Sons of bitches. - You know, we're talking\nabout individual black caiman and caiman and different species of caiman but whenever they're together\nand you see multiple eyes, which I've gotten to experience, it's quite a feeling. There's just multiple\neyes looking back at you. - [Paul] Mm-hmm. - Of course, for you that's immediate excitement. You immediately go towards that. You wanna see it, you want to explore it, maybe catch them, analyze\nwhat the species is, all that kind of stuff. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- What's, can you just describe that feeling when they're together and\nthey're looking at you? So head above water, eyes\nreflecting the light. - Yeah, so the other night Lex and I were in the river with JJ\nsurviving a thunderstorm. We're in the rain and we had covered our equipment with our boats. And the only thing that we could do was get in the river to keep ourselves dry. And so we were in the river\nat night, in the dark, no stars, just a little\nbit of canopy silhouetted with all this rain coming down. It was such a din you\ncould hardly hear anything. And all the way down river, I just see this caiman\neye in my headlamp light. And I started walking towards\nit because I was like, this is even better. We can catch a caiman while\nwe're in this thunderstorm in the Amazon River. And when JJ went, \"Paul, it's too far.\" JJ very rarely, very rarely, like he'll make a suggestion. Like, he'll usually go\nlike, \"Maybe it's far.\" (Lex laughs) But in that situation,\ndeep in the wilderness, unknown caiman size, he went, \"Paul, it's too far. Don't leave the three of us right now.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- We were too far out to take risks. We're too far out to be walking along the river bed at night. Because then, you know, right\nhere at the research station, if you step on a stingray, you get evaced. Out where we went, nothing. So for me, seeing those eyes, I think I've become so comfortable with so many of these animals\nthat I may have crossed into the territory where I feel so comfortable with many of these animals that they just don't worry me anymore. I mean, you were, I\nlooked at you in a raft while you had a sizable, probably about 12-foot black\ncaiman right next to your raft. I watched its head go under. - Bubbles, bubbles.\n- The bubbles. It was all coming up\nright next to your raft as he was just moving along\nthe bottom of the river 'cause he looked at me, went under, and then my raft passed\nand yours came over him. So now I'm looking back and your raft is going over this black\ncaiman and I'm going, I'm not worried at all. I was not worried. I was not worried that the\ncaiman would freak out. I was not worried that he\nwould try to attack you. I knew 100% that caiman\njust wanted us to go so he could go back to eating fish. - [Lex[ Yeah.\n- That's it. - Man, it's humbling. It's humbling, these giant creatures. And especially at night,\nlike you were talking about. And for me it's both\nscary and just beautiful when the head goes under. - Hmm.\n- Because like underwater, it's their domain so anything can happen. So what is it doing that\nits head is going under? It could be bored, it could be hungry, looking for some fish. It could be maybe wanting to come closer to you to investigate. Maybe you have some food around you. Maybe it's an old friend of\nyours and just wants to say hi. I don't know. - I have a few on the river, old friends.\n- [Lex] Okay. - No, when we see their\nheads go under, it's just, they're just getting outta the way. We're shining a light at\nthem and they're going why is there a light at night? I'm uncomfortable, head under. So these caiman, again, you think of it as this\nbig, aggressive animal, but I don't know anybody that's\nbeen eaten by a black caiman and the smaller species,\nsmooth-fronted caiman, dwarf caiman, spectacled caiman, they're not gonna eat anybody. Again, at the worst, if\nyou were doing something inappropriate with a caiman, like you jumped on it and\nwere trying to do research and it bit your hand, it\ncould take your hand off. But that's the only time. I've been walking down the river and stepped on a caiman and\nthe caiman just swims away. And so in my mind, caiman are just these, they're peaceful dragons that\nsit on the side of the river. And so to me, they are my friends and I worry about them\nbecause two months ago we were coming upriver and on one of the beaches was a beautiful, about five-foot black caiman\nwith a big machete cut right through the head. The whole caiman was\nwasted, nothing was eaten, but the caiman was dead. - What do you think that was? - Curious humans. - [Lex] Just committing violence? - Yeah, just loggers, people who aren't from\nthis part of the Amazon because a local person\nwould either eat the animal or not mess with it. Like, Pico would never\nkill a caiman for no reason because it doesn't make any sense. So these are clearly people\nwho aren't from the region, which usually means loggers 'cause they've come from somewhere else. They're doing a job here\nand they're just cleaning their pots in the river at night and they see eyes come near them because the caiman probably smells fish. And then they just whack\n'cause they want to see it. And they're just curious\nmonkeys on a beach. And again, me friend of\ncaiman, I protect from my type. - That said, you know,\nyou protect your friends and you analyze and study your friends. But sometimes friends can have\na bit of a misunderstanding. And if you have a bit\nof a misunderstanding with a black caiman, I feel like just a bit of a\nmisunderstanding could lead to a bone crushing situation. - But not for a little, five-foot caiman. And I think that's\nincredibly speciesist of you. (Paul laughs) - Of all humans or all caiman? - No, like all my friends\ndo the same thing. They go, \"You swim in\nthe Amazon rainforest?\" You know, \"You swim in that river?\" And I go, \"Yes, every day.\" We, you know, back flips into the river. We've been swimming in\nthe river how many times with the piranha and the stingray and the candiru and the\ncaiman and the anacondas, all of it in the river with us. And we just do it. And what's that for you? So what allows you to doing that, knowing and having researched\nall the different things that can kill you? Which I feel like most\nof them are in the river. What allows you to just\nget in there with us? - Well, I think it's something about you, where you become like\nthis portal through which it's possible to see nature as not threatening but beautiful. And so in that you kinda naturally, by hanging out with you, I get to see the beauty of it. There is danger out there, but the dangerous part of it, just like the, there's a\nlot of danger in the city. There's danger in life, there's a lot of ways to get\nhurt emotionally, physically. There's a lot of ways to die\nin the stupidest of ways. We went on an expedition\nthrough the forest, just twisting your ankle,\nbreaking your foot, getting a bite from a\nthing that gets infected. It's, there's a lot of\nways to die and get hurt in the stupidest of ways in a nondramatic, caiman\neating you alive kind of way. - Yeah, it strikes me as\nunfair because humans, we're still in our minds so programmed to worry about that predator. That predator, that predator. What predator? We've killed everything. Black caimans are coming off\nthe endangered species list. We exterminated wolves from North America. I actually heard a suburban\nlady one time tell her son, \"Watch out, foxes will get you.\" Foxes.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They eat baby rabbits and mice. - Well, in the case of apex predators, I think when people say dangerous animals, they really are talking about\njust the power of the animal. And the black caiman have a lot of power. - A lot of power. - [Lex] And it's almost\njust a way to celebrate the power of the animal. - Sure, and if it's in celebration, then I'm all for it because\nmy God is that power, like the waves of fury that you saw. Like when that tail, I mean\nyou saw, you saw the tail, the spectacled, that\nperfect, amazing thing with all those interlocking\nscales that works. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So it's like a perfect creation of engineering. And then when you have\none that's this thick and all of a sudden that thing is moving with all the acceleration of that power, the volume of water, the sound that comes outta their throat. They're such, they're dragons. - We talked about the scales\nof the snake with like, the caiman, just the way it felt. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Was incredible. Just the armor, the\ntexture of it was so cool. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- I don't know, like the bottom one came and\nhas a certain kind of texture and it just all feels like power but also all feels like\ndesigned really well. It's like exploring through touch, like a World War II tank or\nsomething like that, just. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- It's the engineering that went into this thing. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- That like the mechanism of evolution\nthat created a thing that could survive for such a long time. It's just, like, incredible. This is a work of art. The, you know, the defense\nmechanisms, the power of it, the damage it can do, how effective it is as a hunter. All of that, all you could feel\nthat in just by touching it. - Do you ever see the mashup\nwhere they put side by side the image of, I think\nit's a falcon in flight next to a stealth bomber and they're almost the exact same design. It's incredible, like that. - What's the equivalent for a croc? (Lex and Paul laugh) - Like you said, maybe a tank. - [Lex] Maybe a tank.\n- More like armadillo, turtle. - [Lex] Yeah, like hippos.\n- I dunno. Yeah, there may not be a machine, a war machine equivalent of a crocodile. It would have to have like a big jaw element to it. - In the water, I mean we\ntalked also about hippos. Those are interesting creatures from all the way across\nthe world, just monsters. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Hippos and rhinos. Hippos are bigger usually,\nor rhinos are bigger? - Rhinos. Rhinos is the, after\nelephants is the largest. White rhinos. - They can be terrifying too. Again, when you step into the defense. - Absolutely, but I have to tell you, after being around so many rhinos. - You have friends,\nyou have friend rhinos? - I have rhino friends. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Black and white rhinos. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And they're all sweethearts. And I mean sweethearts. And I mean when you look at a rhino, it's like a living dinosaur. I know it's a mammal, but\nsomehow it's screams dinosaur 'cause it seems like Pleistocenic and from another age with the giant horn. And they're so much bigger than you think. Like, they're minivan sized animals. Like you're, we're not taller\nthan they are at the shoulder. And they have this strange shaped head and the huge horn and they sit\nthere eating grass all day. So if a rhino is dangerous to a human, it's because the rhino\nis going don't hurt me. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Don't hurt me. Don't hurt my baby. And then they're like, you know what? I'll just kill you, it'll be easier, 'cause you're scaring me right now. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You're too close to that rhino.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And so like there again,\nI just think it's funny 'cause humans were so quickly to go, \"Which snakes are aggressive?\" There are no aggressive snakes. You know, rhinos can be\ndangerous if provoked. Otherwise, they're peaceful,\nfat, grass unicorns, you know? Like, they're really pretty calm. - Yeah.\n- We had these incredible giant animals and the largest\nanimals on our planet, the black caiman, the\nrhinos, the elephants, all the big, beautiful stuff\nis becoming less and less. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And it almost reminds me like in \"Game of Thrones\",\nthey're like, yeah, they're, in the beginning they're like, yeah, there used to be dragons. And it was like this\nmemory and it's like, yeah, we used to have mammoths and we used to have Steller's sea cows that were 16-feet long, manatees. And it's, there were\nthings we used to have, the Caspian tiger that only\nwent extinct in the '90s, our lifetimes. And it's, that's mind-blowing to me. That has haunted me since I'm a child. I remember learning about\nextinction and I went wait, you're telling me that, I remember being a kid and going by the time I grew up\nyou're saying that I, gorillas could be gone,\nelephants could be gone, and because we're doing it? And then I just that, I remember, I remember looking at the\nnightlight being blurry 'cause I was crying. I was so upset and oh, and\nit was Lonesome George, that turtle, the Galapagos tortoise where there was one left and they said. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- If we just, if we just had a female, he could live. And I as a six, seven, eight\nyear old, that destroyed me. - We're all just trying to get laid, including that turtle. - Including that turtle\nfor a few hundred years. Dude. (Lex laughs) - So for young people out there, you think you are having trouble. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Think about that turtle. - Think about that turtle, yeah. You know, there's a turtle that Darwin and Steve Irwin both owned. - Yeah, yeah, I heard about that turtle. Man, they live a long time. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- They've seen things. - They've seen things that, there's a great like internet joke where they're like, they're\nlike accusing him of like being incongruous with modern times. They're like, he did\nnothing to stop slavery. He didn't fight in World War II. (Lex and Paul laugh) - Cancel the turtle. - Yeah, cancel the turtle. - Oh shit, what a world we live in. So it's interesting you mentioned\nblack caiman and anacondas are both apex predators. So it seems like the reason they can exist in similar environments\nis 'cause they feed on slightly different things. How is it possible for them to coexist? I read that anacondas can eat\ncaiman, but not black caiman. How often do they come in conflict? - So anacondas and caiman\noccupy the exact same niche and they're born at almost\nthe exact same size. And unlike most species, they don't have sort of a size range that they're confined to. They start at this big. Baby caiman are this big. Baby anacondas are a little longer, but they're thinner and\nthey don't have legs. So, it's the same thing in terms of mass. And they're all in the streams\nor at the edges of lakes or swamps. And so the baby anacondas\neat the baby caiman. Baby caiman can't really\ntake down an anaconda. They're going for little insects and fish. They have a quite a small mouth. So they, again, it's in\ntheir interest to hide from everything. A bird, a heron can eat a\nbaby caiman, pop it back. And so they have to survive but the anaconda and the caiman\nkind of joust as they grow. - Can you actually\nexplain how the anaconda would take down a caiman? Like, would it first use\nconstriction and then eat it? Or what's the methodology? - Yeah, so anacondas have\na kind of a, I don't know, like a three-point constriction system where their first thing is anchor. It's like jiu-jitsu. So the first thing is latch onto you. - I like how I'm writing\nthis down, like, all right. - [Paul] Yes.\n- This is jiu-jitsu like masterclass here. - This is for when you're\nwrestling an anaconda, just in case. (Paul and Lex laugh) - And you'll be like the coach\non the sidelines screaming. - You got it, Lex. (Lex laughs) Don't let him take the back. - Yeah.\n- All right, so one time me and JJ were following\na herd of collared peccary and JJ is teaching me tracking. So we're following, you\nknow, the hoof prints through the mud and we're doing this and I'm talking about no backpacks, just machetes, bare feet\nrunning through the jungle. And we come to this stream and JJ is like, \"I think we missed them. You know, I think they went.\" And I'm like, \"No, no,\nno, they went here, look.\" And not 'cause I'm a great tracker 'cause I can see, you know,\na few dozen footprints, hundreds of individual\nfootprints right there. And I'm going, \"No, no,\nthey just crossed here.\" And JJ was like, \"You know what? We're not gonna get eyes on 'em today.\" He was like, \"It's okay.\" He's like, \"We did good. We followed them for a long time.\" And I was like, \"Cool.\" And then I was trying to gauge like, can I drink this stream? And I see a culpa and a\nculpa is a salt deposit where animals come to feed 'cause sodium is a deficiency that most herbivores have here. And all of a sudden I just hear like the sound of a wet stick snapping, just that bone crunch. And I look down and there's\nabout a 16-foot anaconda wrapped around a freshly\nkilled peccary, wild boar. And what this anaconda\nhad done was as the, all the pigs were going across the stream, the anaconda had grabbed it by the jaw, swiped the legs, wrapped around it, bent it in half and then crushed its ribs. And that's what the anaconda do whether it's to mammals, to caiman, it's all the same thing. It's grab on, they have six\nrows of backwards-facing teeth. So once they hit you,\nthey're never gonna come off. You actually have to go\ndeeper in and then open before you can come out. All those backward-facing teeth, so they have an incredible anchor system and then they use their weight\nto pull you down to hell, to pull you down into that water, wrap around you and\nthen start breaking you. And every breath you take, you go. (Paul gasps) And you, you're up against a barrier. And then when you, when you\nexhale, they go a little tighter and you're never gonna\nget that space back. Your lungs are never\ngoing to expand again. And I know this because\nI've been in that crush before JJ pulled me out of it. And so this pig, the\nanaconda had gotten it and as the pig was thrashing and the anaconda was wrapping around, it had bent it in half. And I just heard those vertebrae going. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And so for a caiman, it's the same thing. They just grab 'em, they wrap around it and then they have to crush\nit until there's no response. They'll wait an hour,\nthey'll wait a long time until there's no response from the animal. They'll overpower it,\nthen they'll reposition, probably yawn a little bit, open their jaw and then\nstart forcing that entire. Now here's the crazy thing, is that an anaconda has stomach\nacid capable of digesting an entire crocodile where\nnothing comes out the other side. And when you see how thick the bony plate of a crocodile skull is, that that can go in the mouth and nothing comes out the\nother side, that's insane. And so it always made me\nwonder on a chemistry level how you can have such\nincredible acid in the stomach that doesn't harm the anaconda itself. And someone said mucus, but it's. - But it's able to digest,\noh, it's some kind of mucus. Oh, the mucus.\n- [Paul] The mucus. - There's oh, interesting. There's levels of protection\nfrom the anaconda itself. But it seems like the anaconda\nis such a simple system as an organism. - [Paul] I know.\n- Like that simplicity, taken at scale, it could just do the, can swallow a caiman, digest it slowly. - I know, but my question\nwas how on Earth is it physically possible\nto have this hellish bile that can digest anything, even something as horrendous\nas a caiman scales and bones and all the\nhardest shit in nature and then not hurt the snake itself? And I had a chemist explain to me that it's probably some\nsort of mucus system that lines the stomach\nand neutralizes the acid and keeps it floating in there. But my god, that must be powerful stuff. - So what does it feel like, being crushed, choked by an anaconda? - You, when an anaconda\nis wrapped around you and you find yourself in\nthe shocking realization that these could be your\nlast moments breathing, you are confronted with the vast disparity in power, that there is so much\npower in these animals, so much crushing, deliberate, reptilian, ancient\npower that doesn't care. They're just trying to get you to stop. They just want you to stop ticking and there's nothing you can do. And there's, I find it very awe-inspiring when I encounter that kind of power. When you, even if it's\nthat you see, you know, you see a dog run, you know? You ever try to outrun a dog and they just zip by you and you go, wow. You know, or you see a horse\nkick and you go, oh my god, if that hoof hit anyone's head, it'd knock 'em three states over. And it's like there is muscular power that is so far that, like you said, that explosive, that we dream of doing it. Like imagine if like a\nMuay Thai kickboxer could harness that sort of\ncaiman power, that smash. And so it's just awe-inspiring. I think it's really, really\nimpressive what animals can do. And we're all, you know, we're all the same sort of\nmakeup for the most part. All the mammals, you know? We all have our skeletons look so similar. We all have like, you know, if you look at like a\nkangaroo's biceps and chest, it looks so much like a man's. And if same thing goes for a bear, or you ever see a naked chimp? - Have I?\n- There's like chimps with alopecia.\n- [Lex] Oh shit. - And so.\n- [Lex] Oh they're shredded. - It looks like a bodybuilder. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Like it's got cuts and huge, huge everything. Like it's got pecs and they\ngot that face that's just like, just let me in. - What, no.\n- Yeah, where's your wallet? - Yeah, do something. But yeah, but there's a, the specialization of a\nlifetime of doing damage to the world and using those muscles, it just makes you just\nthat much more powerful than most humans 'cause humans\nI guess have more brain, so they get lazy. They start puzzle\nsolving versus, you know, using the biceps directly. - Well, yes and no and I\nhave this question, okay. So I, you know, that whole\nyou are what you eat thing. Now we one time here had two chickens. Now, one of them was a wild chicken, like from the farm had\nwalked around its whole life finding insects, and the other chicken\nwas like factory raised. And so we cut the heads\noff of both of them, started getting ready to cook 'em. Now the factory-raised chicken was like a much higher percentage of fat, had less muscle on its body, was softer tissue, a lighter color. The farm-raised chicken had\ndarker, more sinewy muscles, less fat, was clearly\na better-made machine. And so my question is is that what's happening with us? You know, like if you go see a Sherpa who's been walking his whole\nlife and pulling, you know, and walking behind muskoxes\nand lifting things up mountains and breathing clean air\nand not being in the city versus someone that's just\nbeen chowing down at IHOP for 40 years and never\ngetting off the couch. Like, I imagine it's the same thing, that you become what you eat. - Yeah, I mean like you and I were like, half dead, running up a mountain. Meanwhile, there's a\ngrandma just like walking and she's been walking that road and she's just built different. - With her alpaca on her shoulders. - With a baby, she just, they're just built different when you apply your body in a\nphysical way your whole life. - Yeah, like you can't replicate that. Like, just like that chimp has those from constantly moving through the canopy, constantly using those arms. Just like if you ever, you know, if you see an Olympic\nathlete or you hug Rogan. - Exactly the same. - You just go, what? Why is there so much muscle here? (Paul and Lex laugh) - That's exactly what I feel\nlike when you give him a hug, this is definitely a chimp of some sort. (Paul laughs) How does that, just that the constriction\nof the anaconda, just the feeling of that, are they doing that based on instinct or is there some brain stuff going on? Like is this just like a basic\nprocedure that they're doing and they just really don't give a damn, they're not like thinking, \"Oh Paul, this is this kind of species, he would taste good,\" or is it just a mechanism\njust start activating and you can't stop it? - With an anaconda, I really\nthink it's the second one. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I do think that they're impressive and beautiful\nand incredibly arcane. I think they're a very simple system, a very ancient system. And I think that once\nyou hit predation mode, it's going down no matter what. This stupid mosquito, I'm going like this and every time he just\nflies around my hand, like I'm a big, slow giant, woo. And he just goes around my hand and then he goes back to the same spot. Like, and I'm like, no. And then he comes right\nback to the same spot. It's like, it's like\nhe's just going fuck you. - Well here's the question. If the mosquito is stupid\nand you can't catch it, what does that make you? - Stupid. Dude, I flicked a wasp\noff me the other day. It flew back like 12 feet\nand in the air, corrected, and then flew back at my face. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It made so many correct like calculations and corrections\nand decided to come back and let me know about it. And it was like. - And that wasp probably\nwent back to the nest, said \"Guess what happened today?\" - Yo, this bitch ass kid from\nBrooklyn tried to flick me and I showed him what's\nup, I had him running. - They had a good chuckle on that one. Yeah you actually mentioned to me just on the topic of\nanacondas that you've been participating in a lot of\nscientific work on the topic. So like really in everything\nyou've been doing here you are celebrating the animals, you're respecting the animals, you're protecting the animals, but you're also excited\nabout studying the animals and their environment. So you've, you're actually\na co-author on a paper, on a couple of papers. But one of them is on anacondas and studying green\nanaconda hunting patterns. What's that about? - So the lead authors of that paper, Pat Champagne and Carter\nPayne, friends of mine, and what we started noticing for me began at that story I told you where we were coming across the stream\nand we saw the anaconda had been positioned just below a culpa. And then other people began noticing that anaconda seem to always\nbe beneath these culpas where mammals were gonna be coming. And that contrasted with\nwhat we knew about anacondas. 'Cause what we understood about anacondas, that they're purely ambush predators and they don't pursue their prey. But what we began finding out here, and Pat led the process\nof amazing scientists. He worked with the Acadia\nUniversity for a long time, worked with us for a long time. And he was one of the\nfirst to put a transmitter in an anaconda right around here. And we were able to see their movements. And that's what these papers are showing, is that they actually\ndo pursue their prey. They do move up and down using the streams as corridors through the forest. They actually do pursue their prey. They actually do seek out food. So I mean, think about\nit, it's a giant anaconda. Obviously it's not, it\ncan't just sit in one spot. It has to put some work into it. And so they're using scent and\nthey're using communication to use the streams. So you could be walking in the forest in a very shallow stream and see a sizable anaconda looking for a meal. - So in the shallow stream it moves not just in the\nwater, but in the sand. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- So it's, it also likes to burrow a little bit? - They burrow quite a bit. And so these large snakes operate subterranean more than we think. - [Lex] Interesting.\n- Like there's times that you'll go with a tracker, you go with a telemetry set and it'll say. (Paul beeps) Like we will be over the snake, snake's underground. Snake has found either a recess under the sides of the stream, you saw it last night, where all the fish have their holes under the side of the stream. There was a six-foot dwarf\ncaiman right in the stream, right where we were standing. And he had his cave, he goes under there. They know, they have their system. - Yeah, we walked by it. - We walked by it and\nhe stuck his head out 'cause he thought we'd gone. And then we turned around and\nI just got a glimpse of him 'cause I was in the front of the line and he just went right back into his cave. You guys are not gonna touch me. And so yeah, with the anacondas,\nit's been really exciting. And in 2014, JJ and me and\nMohsin and Pat and Lee, we all, we ended up catching\nwhat at the time was the record for Eunectes murinus\nscientifically measured. It was 18 feet, six inches, 220 pounds, one of the largest female\nanacondas on record. And since that time, these guys have been continuing\nto study the species, continuing to just, again, just add a little bit by little bit\nto the knowledge we have of the species. And studying green anacondas\nin lowland tropical rainforest. You've seen how hard it is to move, to operate, to navigate\nin this environment. And so when you think of the\nfact that in order to learn anything about this species, you have to spend vast amounts\nof time first locating them and then finding out a\nway to keep tabs on them 'cause even if you get lucky enough to see an anaconda by\nthe edge of a stream, to be able to observe it over time, to learn its habits or to put\na radio transmitter on it, or to take any sort of\nvaluable information from the experience is almost impossible. And so a lot of the\nstuff that I wrote about in \"Mother of God\", us jumping on anacondas\nand trying to catch them, and at first it just seemed like something we were doing to\nlearn, to just try and see them. But it ended up being\nthat we were wildly trying to figure out methodology that would have scientific implications later on. Because now it's allowing\nus to try and find the largest anacondas. And people used to say there's no way there's 25 foot, 27 foot. Well, there's just that\nvideo of the guy swimming with the 20-foot anaconda. And so now as we keep going, I'm going, well, maybe\nthrough drone identification we could find where the\nlargest anacondas are sitting on top of floating vegetation. And even then, how do we restrain them so that we could measure them\nand prove this to the world? It's sort of a side quest, but. - So by doing these kinds of studies, you figure out how they\nmove about the world, what motivates them in\nterms of when they hunt, where they hide in the world as the size of the anaconda change. So all of that, those\nare scientific studies. - Yeah, I mean look, there's\nso much that we don't know about this forest. We don't know what medicines\nare in this forest. We don't know, with a lot of the 1,500, there's something like\n4,000 species of butterflies in the Amazon rainforest. And of the 1,500 species\nthat are here in this region, all of them have a larval stage. Caterpillars, right? And each of the caterpillars\nhas a specific host plant that they need to need to eat in order to become a successful butterfly to enter the next life cycle. And for most of the species\nthat fill the butterfly book, we don't know what those interactions are. I recently got to see a, the white witch, which is a huge moth. It's one of the, it's one of the two\nlargest moths in the world. It's the largest moth by wingspan. - [Lex] Wow.\n- Huge, it looks like a bird. Big, white moth. We still, I believe\nthat we still don't know what the caterpillar looks like. It's 2024. We have iPhones and\npenis-shaped rocket ships, like. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- We don't know where that moth starts its life. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- We still haven't figured that out. - By the way, the rocket\nships are shaped that way for efficiency purposes, not because they want it to\nlook, make it look like a penis. Speaking of which, I've ran\nacross a lot of penis trees while exploring.\n- Have you? - And it make me very, I, this, I know it's not just a\nfigment of my imagination. I'm pretty sure they're real. In fact, you explained it to me and they make me very uncomfortable. (Paul laughs) Because there's just a lot of\npenises hanging off of a tree. - [Paul] Yes.\n- I don't know what the purpose is. I don't know who they're\nsupposed to attract, but it certainly makes. (Lex laughs) But certainly, Paul\nlike really enjoys them. - Yeah, yeah, well clearly\nyou've done some research and you've noticed a lot of them. I haven't even seen them. - There was a time when I almost fell and to catch my balance, I had to grab one of the\npenises of the penis tree and. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Unforgettable. Anaconda, the biggest,\nbaddest anaconda in the Amazon versus the biggest, baddest black caiman. 'Cause you mentioned there\nlike, there's a race. If there's a fight, this is UFC in a cage, who wins on the water?\n- This is the biggest and the baddest? - The biggest and the\nbaddest that you have, can imagine given all\nthe studies you've done of the two animals, species. - Biggest and the baddest, you're talking about an 18 foot, several hundred pound black caiman versus a 26 foot, 350 pound anaconda. Yeah, I think it's a death stalemate. I think the caiman slams\nthe anaconda, bites onto it. The anaconda wraps the caiman, and then they both thrash around until they both kill each other 'cause I think the caiman\nwill tear him up so bad. - And the caiman's not gonna let go. He's just gonna get.\n- The caiman's never gonna let go. But then he's gonna realize that he's also being constricted. So then he's gonna stop and\nhe's gonna keep slamming down on that anaconda. And the anaconda is just\ngonna keep constricting. But if the caiman can do enough damage before the, it's again, it's almost like a striker versus a jiu-jitsu. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You know? If you can get enough elbows\nin before they lock you. - How fast is the constriction? So it's pretty slow. - It's, no, it's incredibly,\nit's incredibly quick. So it's, you see, you take the back and get\nme in choke hold, it's that. It's, I have maybe 30 seconds, maybe on the upward side\nif you haven't cinched it under my throat. But if you've gotten\ngood position, it's over. - Is there any way to unwrap a choke? - [Paul] No.\n- Undo the choke, defending? - Not unless you have outside help. Unless you have, you know, another human or another 10 humans coming to unwrap the tail, help you. But for an animal, like if a deer gets hit by an, no way, they don't stand a chance. - So the black caiman\nwould bite somewhere, somewhere close to the head and then and just try to hold on and thrash. - Yeah, I don't think\na large black caiman, here's the thing. Every fisherman knows this,\nlike the biggest fish, they're smart.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And more importantly, they're\nshrewd, they're careful. A huge, black caiman that's 16 feet long isn't gonna be messing\nwith a big anaconda, Like they, they'll, they won't cross paths because\nwhile they technically occupy the same type of environment, that black caiman's gonna\nhave this deep spot in a lake. And that anaconda's gonna have\nfound this floating forest, like sort of black stream,\nbackwater where it's gonna be. And they'll have made that\ntheir home for decades. And they'll already have\ncleaned out the competition. So maybe if there was a flood and they got pushed together they could have some sort of a showdown, but almost more certainly is that when they get to that size, that caiman at any sign of danger, boom. Right under the water. Just be, it's almost like,\nit's like even if you, what do you learn when\nyou're a black belt? You know, what do you\ndo with a street fight? You still run away. There's no reason for a street fight. And I think the animals\nreally understand that. There's no reason for this. - So like a giant anaconda\nand a giant black caiman, they could probably even\ncoexist in the same environment just knowing, using the\nwisdom to avoid the fight. Like, why?\n- Yeah, or they would have a big showdown and one of them would\neither die or have to leave. They would have a territorial dispute. - Yeah.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - Without killing either of them. - Yeah, on it, dude, nature,\nanything could happen. One of the things that me and\nPat wrote up was that I saw a yellowtailed crebo, which is like a six-foot rat snake eating an Oxyrhopus melanogenys, which is the red snake\nthat we found last night. And just no one had ever, in scientific literature, we'd never seen a cribo\neating an Oxyrhopus before. And so I had the observation in the field, I sent it to Pat Champagne, Pat writes it up, paper. And so it's like, it's this really cool, that's a really cool system 'cause we're just out here all the time. You end up seeing things. JJ's dad saw an anaconda eating a tapir. Tapir is the size of a cow. - [Lex] Damn.\n- And it's, that guy didn't lie, you know? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Some people, you trust your sources on that. He saw enough stuff, he didn't\nneed to make up stories. And you know how you, you know what I love\nnow is when you go to, when you ask people, when we were going up\nthe mountain with Jimmy. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- JJ said to him, he goes, \"Have you ever seen a puma up here in the mountains?\" And Jimmy goes, \"They're up here.\" And JJ went, \"No, no,\nno, have you seen it?\" And Jimmy went, \"No, never seen one.\" And you know how most people will go, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've seen.\" That makes me trust the\nperson when they admit, \"Nah, I haven't seen it.\" - They're up here, I haven't seen it. And Jimmy's been living\nthere his whole life. - [Paul] His whole life. - There's pumas in the mountains? - [Paul] You know, mountain lions, pumas. - Damn.\n- Whatever the, you know, there's all different names for them. They're distributed from, I think from Alaska\ndown through Argentina. That's, they're everywhere. It's extremely successful species, from deserts to high\nmountains, everything. - I think you're saying\npumas have a curiosity, have a way about them\nwhere they like explore, like follow people.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - Like, just to kind of figure out like just that curiosity versus like, as opposed to causing harm or hunting and that kind of stuff. Like, what is this about? - I think it's based\nin predatory instincts, but I also think there is a playfulness to higher intelligence\nanimals that you don't see in lower intelligence animals. And so something like\na rabbit, for instance, you're never gonna see a rabbit\ncome in to check you out. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You just, you can't even think of it like that. Like, a rabbit's just gonna\neither eat or run away. There's really two settings. When you think of something\nlike a giant river otter or a tayra, which is a,\nthey call it manco here. It's a huge arboreal weasel. And they'll come check you out. I woke up at my house the other day and there was a tayra climbing\nup the side of the house and he was looking down at me sleeping. And it's like, he came to check me out. Like, it's like they're smart enough and they're brave enough. Here's the important thing. They know that they can\nfend for themselves. They can fight, they\ncan climb, they can run. And so they're like, let me, I'm curious. I got time, lemme check this out. - Yeah, they're gathering information. I wonder how complex and\nsophisticated their world model is. Like, how they're integrating all the information about the environment, like where all the different trees are, where all the different nests\nof the different insects are, what the different\ncreatures are that by size, all that kind of stuff. I'm sure they don't have enough,\nyou know, storage up there to like keep all that. But they probably keep\nthe important stuff, basic, you know, so sort of\nintegrate the experiences they have into like, what\nis dangerous, what is tasty, all that kind of stuff. - I think it's more\ncomplex than we realize. You go back to that Frans de Waal book, \"Are We Smart Enough to\nKnow How Smart Animals Are?\" There's so many incredible\nexamples of controlled studies where the researchers\nweren't understanding how to shed being so insurmountably human and understand that there are other types of intelligence, and whether that's elephants or cats. So big cats, for instance, we just saw a camera trap\nvideo from last night. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Where you see one of our workers walk down the trail and then five minutes\nlater, a cat behind him. - By the way, we were walking\njust exactly the same area, also exact same time, yeah. - Yeah, so we're out there and\nthere's deer and there's cats and there's a jaguar and there's a puma, and there's all these animals out there. And we're out in the night, in the inky, black night, in this ocean of darkness\nbeneath the trees. And we're just exploring and\ngetting to see everything and there's all these\nlittle eyes and heartbeats. I love the jungle at night, man. It's the most exciting thing. - You know, one of the things you do when you turn off the headlamp. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Complete darkness. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- All around you. And just the sounds. - Everything you hear,\nthe cicadas, the birds, they're all screaming about sex. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- All the time. So they're just trying to get laid. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So all of them are making mating calls. Now the trick is to make your mating call without attracting a predator. - [Lex] Yeah. - But at night, what amazes me is that for us, it's so, from the caveman logic of\nit's hard to make fire here, it's hard to even light a fire here, to having this incredible\nbeam of it, you know? All of a sudden we can look at the jungle and walk through that darkness. Then we're seeing the\nfrogs on those leaves and the snakes moving\nthrough the undergrowth and the deer sneaking through the shadows. It's like, it's almost as\nsupernatural as skydiving. It's a strange thing to be able to do, that technology allows us to do. We're doing something really complex and we're walking on trails\nthat have been cleared for us, that we've planned out. And so walking through\nthe jungle at night, you just get this freak\nshow of biodiversity. And I'm addicted to it, I truly love it. - Except for the times\nover the last few days when we walked on, through\njungle without a trail. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And that's just a different experience. - Well, how would you\ncategorize if somebody said, Lex, I think I'm gonna go for\na hike through the jungle, not on the trail?\n- Yeah. - [Paul] What would you tell 'em? - Every step is really hard work. Every step is a puzzle. Every step is a full of\npossibility of hurting yourself in a multitude of ways. You just, a wasp nest under a leaf, a hole under a leaf on the ground where if you step in\nit, you're gonna break a knee, ankle, leg and go into, not be able to move for a long time. There's all kinds of ants\nthat can hurt you a little or can hurt you a lot. Bullet ants, there's\nsnakes and spiders and, oh, my favorite that I've gotten to know intimately is different plants with\ndifferent defensive mechanisms. One of which is just spikes so sharp. You have, I don't know if you brought it, but there's. (Lex laughs) - I didn't bring it, I didn't bring it. Where's my club? - There's an epic club with spikes, but there's so many trees\nthat have spikes on them. Sometimes they're obvious spikes, sometimes less than obvious spikes. And you know, it could\nbe just an innocent, as you take a step through a dense jungle, it could be an innocent\nplacing of a hand on that tree that could just completely\ntransform your experience, your life, by penetrating\nyour hand with like 20, 30, 40, 50 spikes. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And just changing everything. That's just a completely\ndifferent experience than going on a trail where you, where you're a observer of the jungle versus the participant of it. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And it truly is extreme hard work to\ntake every single step. - Now just think about this. I think scientifically, 'cause\npeople like to summarize, people like to get really,\nreally sort of cavalier with our scientific progress. And they go, \"You know, we've\nalready explored the Amazon.\" It's like, well have we? Because in between each\ntributary is, you know, let's say just between some of them, let's just say 100 miles\nof unbroken forest. Who's explored that? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Maybe some of the tribes have been there, maybe. Some areas, they haven't been. Now when you're talking about scientists, whether they're Indigenous scientists, Western scientists, whatever, so many of the areas in this jungle that is the size of the continental US still have not been accessed. And the places where\npeople are doing research, see, I've been down here long enough. I see all the PhDs come down here and they all go to the\nsame few research stations. They're safe, they have a bed. If you get heli-dropped into\nthe middle of the jungle in the deepest, most remote parts, you're gonna find micro ecosystems. You're gonna see little\nspecies variations. You're gonna see a type of flower that JJ's never seen before, like what happened the other day. As you start walking through\nnew patches of forest, you start finding new species\nand everything here changes. You just go a little bit upriver and the animals you see differ. You go on this side of the river versus on the north side of the river, there's two other\nspecies of primates there that don't exist here. And that's in the mammal paper that we did with the emperor tamarins\nand the pygmy marmosets that the rangers found. - Yeah, the mammal paper\nis looking at the diversity of life in this one region of the Amazon. What kind of, can you talk\nmore about that paper, \"Mammal Diversity along\nthe Las Piedras River\"? - Once again, the mammal paper. Pat Champagne, the prodigy, he was sort of leading on this with a bunch of other scientists who have worked in the region, including Holly O'Donnell\nout of Oxford, myself. I really just made a few observations. The Junglekeepers rangers got featured because they're the ones\nthat spotted a pygmy marmoset that had previously been\nunrecorded on the river. I got to contribute because I had the only photograph that\nI believe anyone has of an emperor tamarin on this river. It's the first proof of\nemperor tamarin on this river. And that's exciting. It's exciting because, you know, you'll, you can post a picture or share a scientific observation\nor write about something. And then what happens is you get these like couch experts, these armchair experts who will come and say, you know, \"No, no, you don't get blue\nand yellow macaws there. I can tell from my bird book, it says they're not there.\" And they'll tell you\nyou're wrong, you know? No, you don't get wooly monkeys\nthere or emperor tamarins. It's like, but we have proof. And so we're coming together to try and add to that knowledge. - My general sort of amateur\nexperience of the species I've encountered here is like, this should not exist. Whatever this is, this is not real. This is CGI, like what? Just the colors, the weirdness. I mean, there's, I think I called it the\nParis Hilton caterpillar because it's like furry. It looks like a one of those. - [Paul] It looks like Paris Hilton's dog. - Like yeah, yeah. It's like really furry\nand it's transparent and sort of it's transparent. All you see is this white, beautiful fur. It's just like this caterpillar. It doesn't look real.\n- Yeah. - Do you think there are species, like how many species\nhave we not discovered? And is there a species that\nare like extremely badass that we haven't discovered yet? - If you look up how many trees are in the Amazon rainforest, it's something in the\norder of 400 billion trees. There's something like 70\nto 80,000 species of plants, individual types of plants here. 1,500 species of trees. It's so vast that it's comparable, like the scale is like only\ncomparable to the universe in terms of stars and galaxies and for the sheer immensity of it. And so we're describing\nnew species every year and just walking on the trail at night, you and I have seen, you know, you see a tiny, little\nspider hidden in a crevice. And has the scientific eye\never seen that spider before? Has it been documented? Do we know anything about its lifecycle? There's still so much that's here that is completely unknown. You know, we have pictures\nof all these butterflies. Somebody went out with a butterfly net and caught these butterflies,\ntook a picture of it, gave it a name, put it\nin a butterfly book. What do we know? What host plant do they\nuse for their caterpillars? What's their geographical range? What do we actually know? Not that much. So are there creatures out here\nthat haven't been described? Absolutely. - And some of them could be extremely effective predators\nin a niche environment. - Yeah, absolutely. I mean, certainly in the canopy, 50% of the life in a\nrainforest is in the canopy. And we've had very limited\naccess to the canopy for all of history. You know, if you wanted to get up into the rainforest canopy, you basically have to climb a vine. Or with scientists, when I was a kid, I always used to see them\nwith like the slingshots or the bow and arrows. They would shoot a piece\nof paracord over a branch, pull the rope up and then, you know, do the ascension thing. And then you're up in this tree getting swarmed by sweat\nbees, getting stung by wasps. You're trying to do science\nup there in that environment. It's incredibly hostile. And so having canopy platforms, I actually met a guy at\na French film festival who had used hot air balloons to float over the canopy of the Amazon and then lay these big nets over the broccoli of the trees. And the nets were dense enough that humans could walk on the nets and then reach through and\npull cactuses and lizards and snakes, whatever, just take specimens from the canopy. That's how difficult it is, that scientists have resorted\nto using hot air balloons. And so having a tree house, having canopy platforms, having, it's starting to get, there's starting to be\nmore and more access to the rainforest canopy. And so we're beginning to log more data. You know, we've even\nobserved in our tree house, which is supposed to be\nthe tallest in the world, we're seeing lizards that\nwe don't see on the ground, lizards that have never been\ndocumented on this river. Like, we're seeing snakes\nwhere they're saying, we saw this snake inside\na crevice on that tree in the strangler fig and\nwe don't know what it is. It's just people haven't been up there. - And that's where a\nlot of the monkeys are. That's where there's just a\nlot of dynamic life up there. - Yeah, I mean when you\nwake up in the canopy in the morning, in the Amazon rainforest, as soon as that, the darkness lifts, as soon as that purple comes\nin the East in the morning, the howler monkeys start up. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And then the parrots start up, and then the\ntinamous start going, and then the macaws start going. And pretty soon everybody's going, and the spider monkey groups\nare all calling to each other. And it's just the whole dawn chorus starts and it's so exciting. - So you're saying when they're screaming, it's usually about sex. - Sex or territory, usually. - Mm, sex and violence. Or implied violence or\nthe threat of violence. - Yeah, I mean howler\nmonkeys in the morning, they're letting other groups know this is where we're at. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- We're gonna be foraging over here, you better stay away. And so it's a little\nbit respectful as well. There is order in the chaos. - So just speaking of screaming, macaws are like these beautiful creatures. They're lifelong partners. They stick together. So there's you often\nsee, they're monogamous, you see two of them together. But when they communicate, their love language seems\nto be very loud screaming. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- What do you learn about relationships from macaws? - That it can be loud and\nrough and still be loving. - And still be loving. But is that interesting to you, that there's like\nmonogamy in some species, that they, they're lifelong partners and then there's like\ntotal lack of monogamy in other species? - It's all interesting. I mean, there's the\nanti-monogamy crew who's like you know, we were never\nmeant to be monogamous. We're supposed to just be animals. And then there's the other\nside of the crew that's like, we were meant to be monogamous. We are monogamous creatures. That's what God wanted\nbetween a man and a woman. And then other people are like, yeah, but I know about these two gay penguins. And so that's natural too. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And so then everyone tries to draw their identity. They're trying to justify\ntheir identity off of the not the laws of nature. So the fact that macaws are monogamous really doesn't have\nanything to do with anybody except for that it's beneficial\nfor them to work together to raise chicks. It's difficult. They rely on ironwood\ntrees or aguaje palms and it's difficult to find\nthe right hole in a tree. There's only so much macaw real estate. And so they need to use those holes. And each one of those ancient trees, it's usually 500 years or more, is a valuable macaw\ngenerating site in the forest. And so if those trees go down, you lose exponential amounts of macaws and that's how you get endangered species. And so that's why we're trying to protect the ironwood trees. - Another ridiculous question. - Tell me.\n- [Lex] If every jungle creature was the same size. - Oh boy. - Who would be the new apex predator, the new alpha at the\ntop of the food chain? - Dude, that's like Super\nSmash Brothers of the jungle. That's incredible.\n- [Lex] Oh yeah, yeah. - Like, bullet ants. If you had a bullet ant that was the size. - Yeah. Can it be like a tournament? - So everyone is pound for pound ratioed. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- For efficiency. So you have basically\nlike a six-foot bullet ant versus a huge black\ncaiman versus an anaconda versus ocelots who are the\nsize of jaguars versus. - Yeah, well let's go bullet\nant versus black caiman, same size.\n- But they're comparable size. - [Lex] Same size. - I don't know, man. I never thought about it. I mean, bullet and has these giant. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Giant, giant mandibles that could probably grab the black caiman. And then at that amount of venom, you're talking about a bucket of venom going into that black caiman. Black caiman's gonna get\nparalyzed immediately. - Well, insects have\njust a tremendous amount of like, strength. I don't know how they generate, what the geometry of that is. The natural world can't\ncreate that same kind of power in the bigger thing, it seems like. - [Paul] It seems like, yeah.\n- It seems like ants and like just these tiny creatures are the ones that are able to\nhave that much strength. I don't know how that works, with the physics of that.\n- Yeah, so like an ant, a leafcutter ant lifting that leaf. That doesn't make any sense. - Yeah, it doesn't make any sense. - It doesn't make any sense. - I don't know if that's\na limit of physics. I think it's just a limit of\nevolution of how that works. - One of the most interesting\nlimits that I heard somebody talking about recently was the reason that dinosaurs\ndidn't get bigger, even bigger. Because that's the conditions on Earth\nwere favorable towards it was that at some point their eggs reached, there's physical limits that\ntheir eggs reached the size. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- The eggs were so big that eggs need to breathe\nfor the embryo to survive. And their eggs reached a limit where in order to have a shell that could hold the mass of the liquid\nand the young dinosaur, if they got bigger, it\nwouldn't be permeable anymore. And I thought that was so interesting 'cause the entire size\nof physical creatures was determined by how thick shell can be before it breaks or before\nit can't pass air through it. - Yeah, there might be a lot\nof that like biophysics limits. - That's fascinating stuff. - Just like the interplay between biology, chemistry and physics of like a life form, 'cause like this thing, there's a lot involved in\ncreating a single living organism that could survive in this world. And bigger, you know, being\nbig is not always good, but being a big creature,\nit's for many reasons, like you were saying, the big creatures seem\nto be going extinct. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- For many reasons, but in the human world is\nbecause they're seen to be of higher value. - Given the current size of the jungle, I think that the MVP, the pound\nfor pound GOAT is ocelots. You know, you're talking\nabout like a mid-size, 40, 50 pound cat that can climb. That does, unlike a jaguar, jaguar, every time it hunts,\nit's going after a deer, it catches a deer, the deer could hit it with its antlers, it could tear it with its hooves. It's risking its life for that meal. An ocelot, ocelots walk around at night and they climb a tree,\neat a whole bunch of eggs, eat the mother bird too, kill a snake, maybe mess around and eat a baby caiman. They can have whatever they like and they're sleek enough and smart enough to get away from predators. They don't really have predators. And so they're sort of, they sort of occupy this perfect niche where they can hunt small\nprey in high quantity without taking on big risks. And so if you had to\nchoose an animal to be, it'd probably be like an ocelot or I would say giant river otters, which are so damn cool because they're, the locals call 'em\n(speaks foreign language), river wolves because they're so tough and they're so social\nand they're so like us because they're intensely familial groups. They live in holes by the sides of lakes and they swim through the water and they catch fish all day long. Piranhas, they eat 'em, just\nlike the scales go flying as they eat these piranhas. And they're so joyous in the way they swim and they have friends\nand they have family. And they, I think it would be, I think we could relate to\nbeing a river otter really 'cause I can't picture being a cat and being so solitary and just marching along a 15 mile route and making sure there's no other cats coming in on your territory\nand marking that territory. It seems very solo and very cat-like. - It's a lonely existence. - [Paul] Lonely existence.\n- And we humans are social beings.\n- We're so social. And so to me, river\notter is just like having a big, Italian family. You're like constantly\neating, you're freaking out. You know, just like causing\nproblems with the black caiman. - Take down a black caiman. - Yeah, start a street fight. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a family thing. You mentioned piranhas.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - What do you think, you know, they're a source of a\nlot of fear for people. What do you find beautiful and fascinating about these creatures? They're also kind of social, or at least they hunt\nand operate in groups. - Yeah, not in the mammalian way though. Piranhas are in large schools, but fish are so different. Like if you, I can talk to you all day about how much I'd love\nto be an otter also. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Going back to the fighting thing, otters and weasels, Mustelidae, tend to be very loose in their skin. So if you grab an otter, it can still rotate around to bite you. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So it's like if I grab you by the back, you're stuck. You know, like we can't, you grab them by the skin. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- They can rotate around and just shred you apart. So they're really cool fighters. Piranha fish, fish, I don't, you know, I don't identify with\nfish in terms like that. I think living out here has\nmade me think of fish as kind of rapid food that\ncan or can't be gotten. Like, you know, to me a piranha is just, is when I see a piranha,\nI think about how I want, how I want it to taste. - Yeah, so like fish is a food source of so many creatures in the jungle. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- So they're primarily a food source. But piranhas are, I mean. - [Paul] Predator as well.\n- They're predators. They're serious predators. - They are serious predators. I found a baby black\ncaiman not that long ago, and he was missing all of his toes 'cause the piranhas had eaten them off. It was really sad. He just had these stumps and he was swimming around\nthe water and I was like, you are not gonna make it. He was like eight inches. And he was such a cute, little puppy. He had those big eyes. And I was just like, \"Man, you already are missing all your toes.\" I was like, just a matter of time. No, he can't get away,\nso some big agami heron's gonna come and just nail\nhim, pop him down his throat. And that's the end of that for the caiman. - I mean, nature is metal. - Nature sure as shit is metal. - Bite off a little bit and\nthen makes you vulnerable. And then that vulnerability is exploited by some other species and then\nthat's it, that's the end. - Yeah, but humans are brutal too. Like that story we heard about that guy the other day who caught a\nstingray on a fishing hook, chopped its tail off to\nmake it safe for humans, cut a piece of the stingray off so he could use it for bait and then threw the live\nfish back in the river. Like, to me that is\nincomprehensible amounts of cruelty with flawed logic in every direction. Like, if you're gonna use the\nthing as bait, use it as bait. If you're gonna remove its tail, well then just kill it all together. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Or if you wanna save the animal and not kill it, then don't maim it before\nyou return it to its, it was such a weird. - So if you kill an animal, you want to use it to\nas fullest by using it as a food source.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - By cooking it, by, you\nknow, eating every part of it, all that kind of stuff. - Yeah, so we have,\nwe've been eating paco. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- [Paul] In your time here. - [Lex] Fried paco is great. - [Paul] Amazing, it's delicious. Full of, you could tell\nit makes you healthy. - Yeah.\n- I feel like we'd better work out so we\ncan go harder in the jungle. - Yeah.\n- And so a few months ago in August\nwhen the river was down, it was, there was a day\nthat the river was clear. And a friend of mine, Victor, who's married to a native girl, he said, \"It's time to go paco fishing.\" And at the time we were stuck out here and we had no resupply. Everybody was busy. And so everyone was demoralized. The staff was hungry, we were hungry. And it really became this thing of like, \"Hey, go catch us some paco.\" They were working on the trails. They were installing the solar. We were working hard\nand we didn't have food. And so we went out to the river and what we did was we went upriver, we camped on the beach. And in the morning, Victor's wife was canoeing with the paddle, dead quiet. Don't let the paddle\ntouch the wooden boat. Nikita was balanced in\nthe middle of the thing. Victor's on the front with\nthis huge fishing rod. And I'm sitting there and he goes, \"I'll catch the first one,\nyou catch the second one.\" And he's got this huge fishing rod and a piece of half rotten\nmeat from the day before. And he's smacking it against the. 6:00 AM, he's just letting\nit smack against the water. And I'm going, and we're\nfloating down the river and I'm going, this is not gonna work. And we're floating and we're floating. And a half hour passes\nand I'm going, it's dawn. I wanna go back to sleep. I'm such an, I'm just\nnot a morning person. And all of a sudden a fish hits that line, almost pulls this man off of his feet and he swings the thing in,\nthe fish comes on the boat. And then I realized he's got\na big metal mallet on the boat so that you could try\nto shut that fish off. And it's this huge, oar-shaped,\nthick, muscular paco. And as soon as I saw\nthat fish, I just thought wow, the strongest of this species for millions of years have\nbeen swimming in this river. And suddenly we've, through this incredible\ncombination of the boat and the cord and the hook, none of which we made, and the skill that he had from\nknowing how to fish a paco, 'cause otherwise no chance\nthat you're getting that fish. They hide, they're very, very suspicious of what you're doing. We had gotten this fish\nonto the boat and plume, you hammer it like a caveman,\nboom, it doesn't die. Boom, you have to crush its skull. And now you have this fish and you're holding this genetic material, this sustenance for your life that has been developing\nsince the dinosaur times. It's so beautiful. The act, the sacred act of eating that, of the fish, of the\ncompetition with the fish. And we spent the morning fishing. We got three pacos, three huge, giant vegetarian piranha. And I just remember touching\nthem with so much reverence, thinking about the incredible history and how that before these rivers existed, those pacos were swimming\nthrough the water and trying to survive through history, through history, through\nhistory until this, until we took just a few. And we did it respectfully and we did it when we needed it most, not at a time when it was just for fun. And it was really, really special. - Well, humans using them for sustenance, there's a collaboration there. That's something also that\nI've seen in the jungle. That there's creatures using each other and it's like a dance of\neither of mutually using each other or it's parasitic or symbiotic. It's interesting, like there's a medicinal plant you grabbed\nthat was full of ants. - Yeah.\n- That were like trying to murder you by biting, but they were defending the\nplant that they were using for whatever purpose. But there's a clear dance there of the ants using the plant\nand the plant existing, therefore other applications\nand other use for humans. And there's that kind of\ncircle of life happening. But the ants were a defense. So the plant didn't have\nits own defense mechanism. The ants, the army of ants was\nthere to protect the plant. - Mm-hmm, and did you actually, when you, remember, we\nput our backpacks down at that one spot and it was like the ants got on your backpack. And I said, \"Oh shit, this is that tree.\" Did you actually get\nbitten by one of those? 'Cause they're incredibly painful. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- The Tangarana one, they're like.\n- Yeah, yeah, surprisingly painful 'cause they're small. They, there's nothing like, luckily have not been\nbitten by a bullet ant yet. - Yeah, but it's just, it's amazing because they live inside the tree. The tree comes standard with holes in it that allow the ants to\nmove and to exist safe. And it protects their eggs\nand they protect the tree. And they, so we saw that\nspot where there was a perfect circle around the trees 'cause the ants had excavated\nthe other vegetation so that those trees could\nhave no competition to grow. The incredible calculation\nof how ants know to guard, come programmed to garden that tree and the tree somehow has been\ngenetically informed to have ant habitat within itself. It's mind-blowing. And it actually is the foundation of a lot of existential confusion for me, because how the hell is this possible? - Yeah, well one of the\nthings you mentioned that's also a source of a\nlot of existential confusion for me is ants.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - And the intelligence of\ndifferent creatures in the forest. There's these giant colonies. There's just giant systems. But even just looking at\na single colony of ants, them collaborating, leafcutter ants, is an incredible system. So individually the ants seem kind of dumb and simplistic.\n- [Paul] Mm. - But taken together, there is\na vast intelligence operating that's able to be robust and resilient, in any kind of conditions\nis able to figure out a new environment, is able to be resilient\nto any kinds of attacks and all that kind of stuff. What do you find beautiful about them? - [Paul] Like as you said, just leafcutter ants in this jungle. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- That's forgetting all the other hundreds of species of ants that are in this jungle. But just the leafcutters apparently digest roughly 17% of the total\nbiomass of the forest. Everything, all these giant\ntrees, all that leaf litter, 17% of that, almost a fifth of this forest cycles through leafcutter ant colonies. So they're constantly\nregenerating the forest. They're a huge source of the\ndriver of this ecosystem. And so to me, when you see them working, it's, again, like I said,\nyou see your friends as you go through the jungle, you see all the kapok\ntree, you see kania tree, oh, there's leafcutter ants\ndoing what it's supposed to do. And it's just so beautiful. I find them very beautiful. Army ants, they're so tough. They're so ready to fight. They have this huge mandibles. They're just ready to, they're just, they're transporting their eggs. They're moving from here to there. Anything that's in the\nway is getting eaten. They're just savage and they're kind of cute for that. Unless you're tied to a tree. - The savagery is cute, yes. - I find it's kind of\nreassuring, you know? You want certain things to be tough. That's their part.\n- Oh, that everybody plays a part in the entirety\nof the nature mechanism. - In the powerful play, but. (Lex laughs) - Yeah, yeah. - But the army ants are so savage. You know, like if you step on army ants, they will all kamikaze and\njust attack onto your feet and they'll just sacrifice their own life for the good of the thing. And they'll be trying to kill your shoes. And there's something\nfunny about that to me. There's something like\nkind of reassuring again, unless, unless, imagine if you're going through the jungle and you slip and you fall\nand you twist your knee. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And you fall in just the right way\nbut you can't get up. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You can't, you're stuck there.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And then army ants find you. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- They will take you apart. There are records of horses\nthat have been tied up and army ants come and they'll\ntake out the whole horse. - Imagine the pain of that. - It might be raining on\nus very hard very soon. - You wanna pause? - No, I think we'll stay here\nuntil the ship goes down. - We should mention that\nthere's this one source of light and we're shrouded in darkness. - [Paul] And now the night\nshift is gonna take over soon. And we are in the Amazon rainforest. - What does the rainforest\nrepresent to you? When you zoom out, look\nat the entirety of it. - Carl Sagan's pale blue dot resonated with a lot of people, that everything you've ever heard of, all the heroes, all the villains, all of your ancestors, every achievement, tragedy, triumph, everything\nhas happened on that one spot. This one tiny, tiny little\nrock that has life on it. And to me, the rainforests represent the crown jewel of that. As far as we know and to\nthe best of our knowledge and with our shrewd, scientific brains at their fullest capacity, this is still the only place\nthat we know that has life. And given that, the fact that there are\nstill these tropical, towering, complex ecosystems\nthat we are barely understand, crawling and full of the\nmost incredible life, it's just, to me it's so wonderful. It's so incredible. Those, the waterfalls and\nthe birds and the macaws and the jaguars, it's barely believable. Like, if you were to theoretically tell a hypothetical alien,\n\"I live on this planet, and there's just these places where everything is interconnected. Everything means something\nto something else and the whole is this\nsystem that keeps us alive. And each tree is pumping\nair into the river, and there's an invisible\nriver above the actual river. And the whole thing goes into stabilizing our global climate. And each little, tiny leafcutter\nant somehow contributes to this giant biotic orchestra that keeps us alive and makes\nour environment possible.\" That is beautiful. I love that. And so the rainforests to me are the greatest celebration of life and probably the greatest challenge for us as a global society, because if we can't\nprotect the crown jewel, the best thing, you know,\nthe most beautiful part, then we're really,\nreally missing the point. - Yeah, the diversity of organisms here is the biggest celebration of life that is at the core of what makes Earth a really special thing. That said, you and I have\nbeen arguing about aliens for pretty much the day I showed up. (Lex laughs) All right you brought a\nmachete to this fight. Luckily, the table is long enough to. - I can't reach you. - You can't reach me. So to you, Earth is truly special. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- You don't think there's other Earths out there, millions of other Earths in our galaxy? When you look up, you know, we were sitting in the Amazon River. - [Paul] Okay.\n- The dark, the storm rolled over.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - And you started counting the stars. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- One, two, and that was once you can count the stars, that was a sign that the\nstorm will actually pass, eventually it will pass. And that's what you're\ndoing, three, four, five. And it's going to pass. You're not gonna have to sit in that river for like all night. So just a couple hours to\nkeep yourself warm, okay. Each of those stars, there's\nEarth-like planets around them. - [Paul] Okay.\n- Why do you think there's not alien civilizations there? - You can write down a\ncalculation on a napkin. You can cite different Hollywood movies. You can point up to the\npieces of light in the stars. But if you, if I talk\nabout show me a single cell that's not from this planet,\nit's still not possible. And so I agree with you that\nthe likelihood is there, all indications point to it. It would be fascinating, especially if it was done in, especially, you know,\nimagine finding a planet of alternative life forms. Not necessarily even intelligent. Imagine just a planet of butterflies, whatever, you know, something else, that would be amazing. But I'm concerned with\nthe reality that we have in front of us is that\nthis is the spaceship, this is life.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And so right now, given that reality, maybe that's the case. Maybe there are other planets or maybe we are the first. Maybe life originated here. Maybe God, the universe,\nwhatever, maybe this is it. This is the testing ground\nfor something bigger and this complexity and\nthis diversity of life and this life that we\nhave is that important. And I think that part of\nwhat we do when we go, oh yeah, but there's other planets, where first of all we're\ntaking an assumption into reality without, I mean, you know, aliens are right now are\nabout as real as Santa Claus. We think they're out\nthere, but we're not sure. Maybe a little more\nreal because, you know, it could make sense. We, no one has an alien. No one's seen an alien, no one's even seen cellular life. And so I'm not, again, if they\nshowed up tomorrow, great, let's study them. But right now we have this\nvery simple threat going on where we can't stop killing each other and our living environment. And so while some people can specialize in looking to the stars\nand to other planets and talk about being an\ninterplanetary species, I'm very much concerned with the fact that here in our home turf, our living environment\nwhere the air is good and the rivers are clean\nand the trees are big and there's macaws flying through the sky and salmon in the rivers, not only do we have a responsibility to each other and to our children to protect this incredible gift\nthat is our entire reality, it seems kind of weird to, at some point, it, conservation\nseems kind of ridiculous. Like you're begging people to not pollute the things that keep them alive. It's almost kind of silly at a point. But we have this incredible thing where there are fish in\nthe ocean and in the rivers that come standard with life on Earth. And we're harming the\nability of Earth's ecosystems to provide for that life. And we are the generation\nthat's gonna decide if those systems continue to provide life to all the people on Earth\nand all the generations. And by the way, all the\nother animals that exist for their own reasons, other consciousnesses\nthat we're just beginning to understand, elephants, humpback whales, whatever, families of giant river otters. You, not everything can be\nseen from a human perspective. These are other species\nthat have their own stories. And so I'm more biocentric\nthan anthropocentric in that I think that nature is important. But I also believe that we are special. We are the most intelligent animal. - So one, I agree with you. There's some degree to which\nwhen you imagine aliens, you forget if by for a moment how special and important life is here on Earth, yes. But it's also a way to reach out through curiosity\nin trying to understand what is intelligence,\nwhat is consciousness? What is exactly the thing that\nmakes life on Earth special? Another way of doing that, and I see the jungle in that same way, is basically treating the\nanimals all around us, the life forms all around\nus as kinds of aliens, as, that's a humbling way. That's an intellectual\nhumility with which to approach the study of like what\nthe hell is going on here? - [Paul] Yeah.\n- This is truly incredible. Like, are the animals we've met over the last few days conscious? What is the nature of their intelligence? What is the nature of their consciousness? What motivates them? Are they individual creatures or are they actually\npart of the large system? And how large is the system? Is Earth one big system and humans are just little\nfingertips of that system? Or are each of the individual animals really the key actors and everything else is in\nthe emerging complexity of the system? So I think thinking about\naliens is a necessary, I like my town with a little\ndrop of poison from Tom Waits is a necessary perturbation of the system of our thinking to sort of say, \"Hey, we don't know what the\nfuck's going on around here.\" Sure, and aliens is a nice way to say okay, the mystery all\naround us is immense. 'Cause to me, likely,\naliens are living among us. Not in a trivial sense, little green men. But the force that created life I think permeates the\nentirety of the universe. That there is a force that's creative. - Now, the force that\ncreated life is a big one. And then the other thing is\nwhat do you mean by that? There's aliens living among us. You mean extraterrestrials? - Yes.\n- Living among us. - Yes.\n- You believe that? - Not like 100% but\nthere's a good percentage. I don't understand how it's possible for there not to be a very large number of alien civilization throughout just our galaxy. - But that's different than saying that they're living among us. If you tell me that there's aliens living five galaxies over and that they're just out there somewhere, I'm kind of more on your\nside than that they're here. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Because just like Bigfoot, like we have camera traps. We have DNA sequencing through water now. Like we can, you're\ntelling me no one found one wing nut of a ship in all, like the Egyptians up until right now, no one in Russia saw like a crashed ship, took a picture, tweeted that\nship real quick and you know? - I think there's no Bigfoot, there's no trivial\nmanifestations of aliens. I think if they're here, they're here in ways that are\nnot comprehendible by humans because they're far more\nadvanced than humans. They're far more advanced\nthan any life forms on Earth. So they're, even if\nit's just their probes, which cannot just even comprehend it, I think it's possible that they operate in the space of ideas, for example, that ideas could be aliens, feelings could be aliens. Consciousness itself could be aliens. So we can't restrict our understanding of what is a life form to a thing that is a biological\ncreature that operates via natural selection on\nthis particular planet. It could be much, much,\nmuch more sophisticated. It could be in a space of\ncomputation, for example. As we in the 21st century are developing increasingly sophisticated\ncomputational systems with artificial intelligence, it could be operating on some other level that we can't even imagine. It could be operating\non a level of physics that we have not even begun to understand. We barely understand quantum mechanics. We use it. Quantum mechanics is a way we used to make very accurate predictions. But to understand why it's\noperating that way, we don't. And there's so many gigantic,\npowerful cosmic entities out there that we detect, sometimes can't detect\ndark matter, dark energy, but it's out there. We know it exists, but\nwe can't explain why and what the fuck it is. We give it names, black\nholes and dark energy and dark matter, but those are all names for things that mathematically equations predict, but we don't understand. And so all of that is just to\nsay that aliens could be here in ways that are for now\nand maybe for a long time going to be impossible\nfor humans to understand. - So aliens in the\nstrict biological sense, like horseshoe crabs, we agree that they're not, we haven't found physical aliens. - The only way I can imagine\nfinding physical aliens is if alien species are trying\nto communicate with us humans or with other life forms and are trying to figure out\na way to communicate with us such that we dumb humans would understand. Like, let's create a thing. - Yo, there's a moth the size of a small eagle. (Paul and Lex laugh) - It's trying to get its\n15 minutes of attention. - It just might, it just might. - Big fan of the podcast. - Okay, Lex, I love you. (Lex laughs) All right, so what you're, wouldn't it be interesting, it'd be really fascinating\nto me if we found out that there were aliens living among us. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And we couldn't see them. And what some of the\npeople were calling aliens, the scientists, the religious\npeople were calling angels. And then everybody had this realization that whether you call\nthem aliens or angels, there are these other, there is more, way more to the universe than we're realizing.\n- Yeah. - I just for me, the fact that there's. - [Lex] There's a skull on the table. - Yeah, there's a skull on table. - [Lex] There's a skull in your hand. - There's now a skull in my hand of a monkey with a bullet in its head that I found on the floor\nof an Indigenous community where they eat monkeys. I didn't kill the monkey,\nso save your comments. But you know, in terms of the animals, I think that when I see\nspace, it, my feeling, and I'm not requiring anybody\nelse to have this feeling, but because we know, 'cause this is the only place\nthat we know that there's life and we have no idea how it started, I just think it's so\nimportant to protect it. And for me it's just as\nmuch about our children as it is about the little spider monkeys and the little baby caiman that\nare in the river right now, because life is so beautiful. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And I think that there's a huge amount of\nintellectual responsibility that we can transfer off of ourselves if we go yeah, the rivers are filled with trash and yeah, extinction is happening, but we have to be an\ninterplanetary species anyway 'cause at any moment this\ncould all end from an asteroid and like, everything's\ngoing to shit anyway. And so it's like, we're\nfucking up this planet and it's like, that's, we're just being angry\nteenagers who are, you know, going goth for a while. And it's like, what if you\njust rolled up your sleeves and said, holy shit, wait a second. You know, we can pretty\nmuch do whatever we want. We can fly all over the world. We have, we can do heart transplants, we can watch Netflix in\nthe Amazon if we wanted to. Like, we could do all this amazing stuff. We can capture on video our adventures and go back and watch them\nagain and again and again. There's so much incredible opportunity that technology has allowed us to do. And we're the richest in history. I mean, we could do everything. We could cross the whole\nplanet in a second. And it's like, that's an\namazing time to be alive. And if we just don't\nfuck up the ecosystems and kill all the other\nanimals, we got it made. - Yeah, so it is true that\nwe can destroy ourselves and nuclear weapons, but it also is true that that\nsnake that I got to handle yesterday is like one of\nthe most beautiful things Earth has ever created. In that little organism is encapsulated the entire history of\nEarth and it's beautiful. So we, both things are true. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- We should worry about the existential\ndestruction of human civilization through the weapons we create and we should become\nmultiplanetary species as a backup for that purpose. But also remember that this place is really, really special and\nprobably, if not difficult, probably impossible to recreate elsewhere. And by the way, there's\nsomething incredibly powerful about a skull. - Yeah, you ever hold a\nhuman skull, it'll give you, it'll weigh on you for a sec 'cause you look into this, the hollow eyes of this face, and suddenly you go,\nyou feel your own teeth, you go, you feel your own skull, and you go, holy shit. You go, what is going on? It's like taking acid,\nyou just go, oh boy, I forgot that I'm a ghost\ninhabiting a meat vehicle on a floating rock. - But even a monkey.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - It's like looking at a ancestor, you know? Not a direct ancestor, but there's a, it's like a, you know, like you looking at a\npuddle at a reflection, - [Paul] Mm-hmm, a little\nblurry, but it's still there. - It's a little blurry,\nbut it's still there. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- It's still there. And like the roots of who\nwe are is still there. And it's all kind of incredible. Do you ever think of the tree of life just kind of like where we came from? - Yeah.\n- [Lex] The jungle is ephemeral, it just keeps, it's a system that just keeps forgetting because it's just churning and churning and churning and churning, has in some ways no history. But to create the jungle,\nto create life on Earth, there's a deep history of\nlots of death, sex and death. - A festival of sex and\ndeath, life on Earth. - That's what I see in the skull. - Yeah. There's something, it's, there's something kind of\nterrifying about that image to me. Like when I hold that skull\nevery now and then at night, you hold that skull and you, it just reminds you that you're temporary. - Yeah, both you and I will one\nday have one of those, yeah. Hmm, mine will be bigger. (Lex and Paul laugh) - My God, the male competition continues. The silverback slaps the\nlesser male once again. - [Lex] Do you have a lighter? - Yeah, bro, you wanna light this blunt? (Paul and Lex laugh) - What are your favorite\nanimals to interact with? - I mean, my favorite,\nabsolute favorite animal to interact with is 100% elephants, which there's no elephants here, but I've been incredibly\nprivileged to spend some time with elephants both in\nIndia and in Africa. And I think that they're\nso smart and so complex that we do a really bad\njob of understanding what an elephant really is. I think that most children\nprobably think of elephants as like something kind of cuddly. Most adults probably think of, have a similar misconception of them. When you see an elephant, when you see a 12-foot tall bull elephant with bone coming out of its face, with huge tusks and those giant, it's an octopus-faced,\nbutterfly-eared behemoth that's a survival machine. And it'll look at you and just go, do I have to kill you to keep safe? And it's just, they're so tough. And they have dirt on their back and they have flower\npetals in the little hair, you realize they have\nhair all over their body and they, the power to throw\na car over, to flip it, just one of the most\nimpressive animals on Earth. And I think that I've gotten really good at interacting with wild elephants in a way that's respectful to them. And I think that when\nan elephant allows you to be in its space, it's because you're showing submissiveness and respect for the elephant space, and they're so intelligent that they're communicating\nwith seismic vibrations through the Earth, that they have high, you\nknow, a matriarchal society, that they can remember the\nmaps of their ancestors, that they know how to found, find water, that they can solve problems. They're such beautiful\nanimals and they're so, talk about aliens. They're so alien looking. - [Lex] So weird.\n- These big, weird heads and the trunks with all those muscles. And they're so different than us. But yet I actually think that\nwe grew up together, you know? They kind of raised us, sibling species, that we've been, we've inhabited\nthe same epoch in history and we've relied on the\necosystems that they've created. And I think that they\nhave a deep understanding of humans, elephants, and I think I see them more like aliens, more like non-human beings\nthat we share the Earth with. So I don't see it as we're\nhumans and they're animals. I actually see elephants as\nsort of a separate society along with humans as one\nof the dominant species on the planet. - So almost every species, especially the intelligent\nones, especially the big ones, are their own societies that overlap and sometimes co-develop. - Yeah, I think whales, I think elephants, I think that there's\nthose higher, you know, no one's suggesting that\nsardines are, you know, somehow need human rights or something. But I think the elephants need\nrepresentation in governments because they influence their landscape. They engineer their environment. They have emotions, they have families, they have burial rituals. They're so like us. And yet we treat them like\nthey're just oversized cows that we have to be scared of. It's, they're not the same\nas domesticated livestock. They're one of the treasures of Earth. I mean, look, let's just say\nlittle green men showed up and you said, they said,\n\"Well, what's Earth?\" It's like, well, there's\nmountains, there's rivers. It's like, well, how do I do this? You know, there's mountains,\nrivers, there's elephants. Like, it's like one of the first things a baby learns is elephant. Even if he's never seen one. It's just so iconic on Earth. Like you said.\n- Darren Aronofsky. - Darren Aronofsky, the elephant\nwalking over the camera. I haven't seen it. You said it's incredible.\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. Saw it at The Sphere,\n\"The Postcard From Earth\". I mean, it's a celebration of Earth. - [Paul] Yeah. - [Lex] In all forms, and one of the critical big\ncreatures in that film is an elephant. And it steps over the\naudience and the whole, like, the (indistinct) reverberates that power. I mean, some of it is size. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Some of it is like, how did Earth create this? It is a weird looking creature, but we take it for granted\n'cause we've accepted that this Earth can\ncreate this kind of thing. But it is weird, beautifully weird. - Oh, it's beautifully weird. I mean, elephants, there's\nsomething really impressive and wise about them. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- There's also beautiful weird that isn't so, that doesn't\ncome with so much grandeur. Like to me a giraffe is beautifully weird. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- But they're just, you know, they're 18 foot tall camel\ndeer things with, you know, giant necks. And they're strange and they're absolutely, serenely beautiful but they don't have that deep intelligence that elephants have. There's something that elephants have, - Do you see it in their eyes? Where is, how does the\nintelligence manifest itself? - Well, this is the thing. A lot of people, a lot of the, when I was reading Frans de Waal's book, a lot of what he was\nsaying was that, you know, people give elephants\nhuman problems to solve in controlled environments\nand call it, you know, a study on elephant intelligence. Whereas if you're watching wild elephants and you're in the wild, you're gonna be watching them\nin a way that they're looking, you've pulled up in a safari vehicle or you've pulled over\nto the side of the road and the elephants are wary of you. So they're not acting natural. But as soon as you start\nwatching wild elephants, truly in the wild, comfortable\nwith your presence, you see how they start\ncaring for their babies or how they can get annoyed. I once watched elephants\naround a waterhole, and there's this warthog, and I don't know why,\nbut this warthog decided he needed to get in and there\nwas this young, male elephant, and he kept turning around to this warthog and just being like, don't make me do it. Now, this elephant did not\nneed to hurt the warthog. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And the warthog was just like, I need a drink, I\nneed a drink, I need a drink. Much simpler brain. The elephant was like,\nyou could just tell, he was like, watch this. And he just went and crushed the warthog like it was a big beetle. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And crushed his pelvis. And the warthog dragged\nitself away on its front legs and probably went off to die. But this young elephant put out his ears and he like paraded\naround with his tail up and he was like, look\nwhat I did, destruction. And it's like, that's a\nvery relatable type of, he was annoyed with the warthog. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And so you see them do these things. I mean, the most magical thing, and I've spoken about this many times, was that I was walking with\na herd of semi-wild elephants that were crossing\nthrough a village in India because elephants have lost\na lot of their territory because there's so much\npopulation in India. And so we were crossing through a village, which is very delicate\nbecause the matriarchs are leading the babies and there's\nvillagers who have no idea what an elephant is. And they're watching the elephants cross. And the matriarchs backed\nthis girl up against a wall, and she was terrified, standing there with her\nback against the wall. And the elephant just put her trunk out and touched the girl's stomach. And then the other elephants came and they all started touching her stomach. And the ranger there\nexplained to me, just went, \"She's pregnant. They know she's pregnant. They can smell, they can\ntell, and they're curious.\" And they, all the female elephants came to investigate the pregnant girl. And she had no idea what was going on. And so it's like that stuff, that stuff. (Paul growls) - And it's cool to hear that, you know, with the crushing and the\npride of a young elephant that there's a complexity of behavior. It's just like with humans,\nI mean, you know, humans. - [Paul] That's not always pretty. - That's the thing, man. Humans are capable of good and evil. And sometimes we attach these words. (animals chirp) I love that there's just, it's an orchestra of different sounds. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And that's, that one is sex? - That's a bamboo rat\ncalling out for a mate, yeah. - A mate, all right. Good luck to you buddy. - Good hunting. - You know, humans are capable of evil things and beautiful things. And I wonder if animals are the same. You think there's just\ndifferent personalities and different life\ntrajectories for animals? Like, as they develop\nin their understanding of social interaction, of survival, of maybe even primitive\nconcepts of right and wrong within the social system, do you think there is a lot of diversity and personalities and behavior? Just like different people,\nis there different elephants? - Of course. And what I really like is that you said is there a perception of\nwhat's right and wrong? Because elephants have a code of ethics. - [Lex] Hmm.\n- And so as the, for the simplest example\nis that as young males begin to grow, they start\ndeveloping these tusks. And those tusks are a\ntool and they use 'em. So for Indian elephants,\nthe females don't have tusks and the males do. The females kick the\nmales out of the herd. The females keep all the\nsisters and the aunts and the cousins together. But the males are their own thing. And so here's the thing. If you have, so what you get is these crews of male elephants and the older males will, you know, there's play fighting that\ngoes on around, you know, two young males can play fight, but the older males,\nthey'll kick some ass. They'll show them how to behave. They'll explain who gets\nto talk to the females, who gets to interact, who gets to mate, who gets the best vegetation to eat. And so there's an order established. And so young male elephants\nhave to be taught how to act, just like a teenage\nhuman has to be taught. You know, you can't just haul off and break another kid's nose. You gotta, there's gonna be consequence. Maybe you'll get suspended, or maybe that kid will get his friends and beat the living shit out of you. Whatever it is, society\nregulates your behavior. And elephants have a very\nstrict, very predictable, sort of like the males teach\nthe males how to run things. And the females, which\nreally have the final say, they're matriarchal. They're the ones leading\nthe herd where to go. The males follow where the wise females tell them where to go. - So that regulation\nmechanisms from that emerges a kind of moral system\nunder which they operate, what's right and wrong. - For an elephant, yeah.\n- [Lex] For an elephant. - Right and wrong for an\nelephant is not the same as what's right and\nwrong for a grizzly bear. Grizzly bear, if you're\na male grizzly bear and you see a female with cubs, you just kill those cubs and\nthen you can mate with that, you can mate with her and\nput your own cubs in there. And it's like, that's a whole\ndifferent type of ethics. - Yeah, the value of\nchild life is different. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- From species to species. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Some of them hold it sacred, some of them not at all. - And that's why I think I\nresonate so much with elephants because they're, I think they're, I think that we are kind of matriarchal, at least I grew up matriarchal. Like, women were the force\nin my life, my family, and most of my friends' families, women kind of had the final say. And I feel like that's the\nway it is with elephants. Like, you might be bigger and stronger, but it doesn't really account for much if you're not smarter and\nmore emotionally intelligent and you know how to\ntake care of the group. - Just to zoom out into\nthe ridiculous questions as we were talking about aliens. - [Paul] Hmm.\n- There's a lot of people trying to understand, trying\nto study the origin of life. - Oh, I love this. - First of all, what do you\nthink is life versus non-life? Like when you look at like ants or even like the simplest,\nsimplest of organisms, we saw a frog in a stream yesterday that was like a leaf frog. It was like as flat as a sheet of paper. And it does a lot of weird things. And it found a way to exist in this world. But that's a single living organisms with a bunch of components to it. But like, there's a life form\nthat exists in this world. What is the difference\nbetween that and a rock? What is that, what is\nthe essence of that life? And this might be an\nunanswerable question. There's probably a chemistry, physics, biology way of answering that. Like, what to you is that? - I think to me, life\nis something that grows and responds to stimuli\nlike in basic biology 101. I think, and I'm fine with that. I don't need it to be\nmore romantic than that. But I think it's actually comical how, how do you get from a rock\nto an orangutan, you know? And our answer for that\nis primordial soup. Maybe there was just stuff on Earth and then the stuff just\ngot up and started walking. Maybe there just, there\nwas nothing happening and then there was all of\na sudden there was a cell. And the cell had function\nand then it complexified and then it started reproducing and found male and female parts. And what? Like it, we are so\nunderequipped to understand how the hell we got here, let\nalone ants or even bacteria. - I see this so many, in very simple mathematical models, like something Game of Life, they're cellular automata. You could see from simple rules and simple objects when\nthey're interacting together, as you grow that system,\ncomplex objects arise. Like that emergence of\ncomplexity is not understood by science, by mathematics at all. And it seems like from primordial soups, you can get a lot of cool shit. And the force of getting from soup to like two humans on microphones. - [Paul] Yeah. - Not understood and\nit seems to be a thing that happens on Earth. I tend to think that\nit's a thing that happens everywhere in the universe and there's some deep force\nthat's pushing this along in some way. That there's something we,\nI don't want to sort of simplify it, but there\nis something that creates complexity out of simplicity\nthat we don't quite understand. And that's the thing that\ncreated the first organism, living organism on Earth, that like leap from no\nlife to life on Earth, that's a weird one. - That's a weird one\n'cause you can imagine, I think that what? The Earth is 4.5 billion years old and you can imagine just this rock of a planet with like\nrain and storms and elements and iron and granite and\nlike, just random stuff. It's pretty easy to imagine that. But then I remember that book that I think we all had the same book when we were kids and then like they show\nthis like fish-like animal crawling out of a, out of the primordial soup. And it's like, bro, you just\nmissed the most important part, author of that book, bro. And I think the first\nbacteria came in around 3, 3.7 billion years ago, so there's like at least like, you know, a bunch of billion years\nwhere there's just nothing. It's just a planet.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And then we start seeing\nfossils of the first bacteria. - And the bacteria stuck\naround for a long time. A billion, 2 billion years. It's just very, very long. - Just bacteria.\n- Just bacteria but a lot of them.\n- [Paul] A lot. - There's probably a lot of innovation, a lot of murder, a lot of interaction. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Yeah. And then, I mean, there's\na big, a few big leaps along the history of life on Earth. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- You know, the predator-prey dynamic. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- That was a really cool innovation. It's almost like innovation's\nlike features on iPhone. It's like, it's nice, like predator-prey, eukaryotes, so complex,\nmulticellular organisms, emerging from the water to land. That was weird. That was a.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - Interesting innovation. This how, whatever led to humans that, there's a lot of\ninteresting stuff there. - See, I can't even get that far. I can't get from rock and sand to cells. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- That's a huge. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I mean, to everything around us that has cells, it's just, it's wild. Even again, and I could\nimagine being on another planet and how incredibly valuable\nthis thing would be. This, it's impossible to replicate. I'm looking at it through\nthe candlelight right now, and I can see all of the\nstructures in this leaf, the incredible structures in this leaf that look exactly like\nthe veins in my arm, which look exactly like the rivers that are flowing across this landscape. And it's like, life has\nthis overwhelming pattern that it uses and it's so beautiful. I just think it's, yeah. When you imagine the days of\nthe lightning and the volcanoes and the primordial soup, it's, there's a big gap there. And it's fascinating to think about and it's fascinating to see how different people's belief systems lead them to different answers there. - Not to give any spoilers, but \"Postcard from Earth\",\nso Darren Aronofsky's film, the idea there is there's\nprobes that are sent out from Earth.\n- [Paul] Oh, that's so cool. - To all these other planets. And each probe contains two\nhumans, a man and a woman. And those two humans are in love. So think of a couple in love. They're sent there with\nall the information, basically a leaf that\nholds the information, what it takes to create\nlife on other planet. - [Paul] Wow.\n- To recreate an Earth on other planets. And the two humans hold\nall the information for the things that make\nlife on Earth special, especially in human civilization, is love, consciousness,\nthe social connection. So all that information\nis sent in the probe and the postcard from Earth\nis those humans waking up, remembering all the information\nthat is Earth, that. - [Paul] Whoa.\n- Like a celebration of all the things that make Earth magical throughout its history, all the diversity of\norganisms, all of that. You're loading all that in to create life on that new planet, which is something I think\nalien civilizations are doing. They're sending probes\nall throughout the galaxy and they just haven't arrived yet. But anyway, that's another. - That's so beautiful. And one of the things that I think, I wanna see that so much and one of the things that I\nlove about Aronofsky's work is \"The Fountain\". And what I find so beautiful about that is that now here he's saying okay, we're sending probes\nout to other worlds, alien civilizations. And in \"The Fountain\", it was\nsort of what I thought he did so beautifully was braid\ntogether those three stories where in one, I don't remember\nif he's in a spaceship or if that's supposed to be like his soul. The other one, he's a scientist in sort of like comparable times to ours. And then he's the Spanish explorer. But either way, there's the tree of life and it sort of braids together\nall of the major religions. And it made me think of\nthat quote that you hear where it says, you know,\noh God, what was it? Christ wasn't a Christian\nand Buddha wasn't a Buddhist and Mohammad wasn't a Muslim. They were all just teachers\nwho were teaching love. And it's like \"The Fountain\" sort of says nature is the, that driving force. And it's our job to understand\nthat the game is love. And that's what the main\ncharacter in \"The Fountain\" needs to learn, is that it's\nnature that's going to just, that's going to carry your\nsoul through this thing. And that there's so much\nyou don't understand. And the epiphany at the\nend, God, I love that movie. God, I love that. - Among many things, you're also an artist that's trying to convert\nthe thing that is nature into the thing that we\nhumans can understand, the complexity, the beauty of it. That's what Darren Aronofsky tried to do with those couple of films. That's something that I hope you do actually in the medium of film too. That would be very interesting. And you do that in a\nmedium of books, for only. How much do you think we understand about the history of life on Earth? - I think we got it all wrong. (Lex laughs) No, I don't know. It seems like they change it all the time. You know, they say that\nEaster Island, you know, when I was in college, they\nwere big on telling you that Easter Island, they\nruined their environment and they had environmental collapse and that's why there was\nnobody on Easter Island. It was a cautionary tale. We could ruin our environment. And now it seems like they've\nchanged their mind on that. And then when humans entered North America seems to be hugely up to speculation. And, you know, the Africa spreading, that we all spread out of Africa and then the Pleistocene\noverkill extinction theory, and it's like, it seems like\nevery few years they update it and they change it and they say, oh, the guys, no, no, no, no, the guy from 10 years ago, actually, my new theory\nis the best theory. Let's write some books\nand get me on Letterman. And it seems like there's\na new prevailing theory that's really always exciting and edgy about how we got here\nand where we came from and how we dispersed and maybe even has some\npolitical implications, like how we should use\nthe Amazon moving forward. Like, the Amazon was engineered\nby people, so fuck it. Let's just cut it down. - Yeah, it's, I tend to believe that we mostly don't understand anything, but there is an optimism in\ncontinuously figuring out the puzzle of that.\n- [Paul] Sure. - We offline talked\nabout the Graham Hancock Flint Dibble debate on Rogan. I like debates, personally.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - [Lex] So Flint Dibbel\nrepresents mainstream archeology. And I actually like the whole science, the whole field of archeology. You're trying to figure out history with so little information. You're trying to put together this puzzle when you have so little and you're desperately\nclinging onto little clues. And from those clues, using the simplest possible\nexplanation to understand. And now with modern technology, as Flint was trying to express, that you can use large amounts of data that's like imperfect, but just the scale and using that to reconstruct civilizations. There are different practices from the little details of\nwhat kind of things they eat, how they interact with each other, what kind of art they\ncreate to when they existed, what are the timeframes,\nall that kind of stuff. - [Paul] Hmm.\n- And that starts to fill in the gaps of our understanding, but still the error bars are large in terms of what really happened. And that leaves room for things like Graham Hancock talks about, like lost civilizations, which I like also because\nit gives, you have a kind of humility about\nmaybe there's giant things we don't know about or\nwe got completely wrong. And that's always good to, like, remember. - It's confusing to me\nto imagine like what, I don't even know what, like what ended the why,\nwhere did the Egyptians go? Like what happened to. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It seemed like they were doing so good. They had so much cool shit. But I mean, I was reading\nanthropological stuff in the Amazon about tribes that, you know, just through their societal structures and through their hunting practices that didn't really develop practices that worked and kind of bands of\npeople that went extinct before they could turn\ninto larger societies. And there's a lot of\npeople that got it wrong. You know, for every explorer that leaves Borneo and\narrives in South America, there's probably hundreds\nmore that just die at sea, get eaten by sharks, you know, avalanche. And it's just, it's so\nfascinating to me that we, all of us really past our grandparents don't really even know where we came from. Like, do you know who your great-great-great grandparents are? Like, no.\n- No. I mean, there's methods of\ntrying to figure that out, but really again, the error bars are so\nlarge that it's almost like we're trying to create a\nnarrative that make sense for us. You know, that I'm 10% Neanderthal, therefore I can bench press this much and therefore my aggressive\ntendencies have a explanation when in reality there's so\nmuch diversity of personalities that they far overshadow any possible\nhistories we might have. - Your aggressive tendencies don't have any explanation, you're. - No, you need to, you\nlisten to me right now. (Paul laughs) - I'm sorry, don't hit me again. Don't choke me out again. - Yeah, man, one of the things\nyou and I talk a lot about is different explorers.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - Who do you think is, I'm just throwing a ridiculous\nquestion one after the other. Who do you think is the\ngreatest explorer of all time? - Oh God, I love Shackleton\nbut I hate the cold, so I can't, I don't really,\nI can't even read about it. I hate the cold so much. (Lex laughs) I can't even go there for fun. I think Percy Fawcett in the Amazon was the GOAT in terms of just sheer, the last of the Victorian era, you know, march forward, go deeper, just stop at nothing and then\neventually take such big risks that you never come back. It's hard for me to relate to that kind of exploration because to me, I'm such a softie. I wouldn't wanna like\nleave my family behind. I wouldn't wanna, like, even if you told me\nthat I could leave Earth and go exploring and I\ncould go touch the Moon, I'd be like, \"Nope, absolutely not.\" Like, the highway is dangerous enough. Like, I would never risk dying in space. This guy left his home, went out into the jungle out there with horrendous gear\ncompared to the camping gear we have today, no headlamp, and just\nexplored for years on end. - Well, let me actually push back, like you have that explorer, there is definitely a thing in you, just me having observed\nyou behave in the jungle, in the world, you're pulled towards\nexploration, towards adventure, towards the possibility of\ndiscovering something beautiful, including like a small, little creature or like a whole new\npart of the rainforest, a part of the world that\nlike is like, holy shit, this is beautiful. I think that's the same\nkind of imperative. So maybe not going out\nto the stars, but like. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- I could see you doing exactly the same thing. So he disappeared in\n1925 during an expedition to find an ancient lost city, which he and other people believed existed in the Amazon rainforest. So there's that pull, like, I'm going to go into there with shitty equipment with the possibility of finding something. - And they said he ran\ninto uncontacted tribes and started goofing off. I think he started, I think he started dancing and singing, like the tribes were ready to kill him. And he started goofing and\nlike doing a song and a dance and just being ridiculous. And the tribes were like, what now? And they're like, \"Wait,\nwait, wait, wait, wait. Don't shoot him yet, that's a funny one.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And they actually, he kind of like on a\nhuman level used humor to save his own life on multiple occasions to the point where he\ndeescalated the situation and was like, look,\nwe're not here to fight. We're here to, we have a\npile of maps, you know? All my guys have\nberiberi, dengue, malaria, like, we're dying out here. If you guys just go on your merry way, we'll go on our merry\nway and like, incredible. He was so tough. And then that guy from\nShackleton's expedition ended up on one of Fawcett's expeditions and you go, oh yeah,\nhe's a proven explorer. He's been through the Antarctic. And the guy was like, \"Fuck the jungle.\" (Lex laughs) Absolutely fuck the jungle. He was like, and there's a\ngreat quote where he says, \"Without a machete and,\"\nsomething, you know, I don't remember exactly\nthe words he used, but he said, \"Without a machete in this environment, you don't last.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And you know that now, like you in that tangle to just take three steps that way would, I would immediately be taking on, I mean, I'm not wearing shoes right now. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Bullet ants, venomous snakes, spikes through my feet, tripping over myself. I don't have a headlamp, unbelievable risk right there. We're sitting on the edge of tragedy. - Can you explain what the purpose of the machete in this situation is? Like, what is a machete? How does it work? How does it allow you to navigate in this exceptionally dense environment? - So this is the tool that I\nspend most of my life carrying. This is in my hand for 90% of my time. And in the jungle you\nreally need a machete. There's so much plant life here that you have to cut your way through. And like a jaguar, an ocelot, a lot of these other animals that are more horizontally based\nand low to the ground, they can make it, like when we got stuck\nin those bamboo patches and we were just hacking\nthrough 'em and it's dangerous and there's, as you hit the bamboo, it ricochets and there's spikes and then one piece falls\nand it pulls a train, a vine that has spikes on it and that hits you in the neck. And it just, the jungle\nis savage to humans. But if you are an agouti, a little rodent or a jaguar or a deer, you can kind of slip through this stuff. And the deer have developed\nreally small antlers. They can just kind of weave\nthrough low to the ground. And so for us being these vertical beings, walking through the jungle, it really helps to be\nable to move the sticks that are diagonally opposing\nyour movement at all times. So a machete's just a\nvery, very useful tool. It could help you pull\nthorns out of your body. As you saw last night, we\ncan use it to find food. - Mm-hmm, you want machete fishing, you cut a fish head off with a machete by like it was swimming and then you basically, you know macheted the water. And the other fascinating thing about that fish without its\nhead, it kept moving, so. - [Paul] That was amazing. - It was just using I\nguess its nervous system to swim beautifully. I mean, there's so many questions there about how nature works. (Paul laughs) - Well, let's explain it 'cause you, the way the machete hit this fish, it kind of took his, just his eyes off of and his lower jaw was still there. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So it was really just like the brain and the\ntop jaw that came off. And this fish as the dust\ncleared in the stream, this fish was, I found it very haunting in a\nvery like, interstellar way. Like it was just, the\nprogramming was still there, but the brain was gone and\nthe fish was just still moving and it was gonna die, but\nit was still swimming. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And it looked like a like a live fish. It was something. - And you're still trying to catch it, which is interesting watch, yeah. - And I had to work to\ncatch it because every time I caught it, it would freak out. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And then it would jump back in the water. And I'm programmed here\nfrom years and years of living in the Amazon that\neverything can hurt you. So you actually become quite, you know, if a moth lands on you, you flick it because it could be a bullet ant. And so even the fish here, a lot of the fish here have\nspikes coming out of them. And so even though I know that fish, I know its name, I've\neaten them many times, as I was holding it, when it would twitch with\nthat explosive power, just like the caiman, I would get that fear\nresponse and release it. And so that happened three or four times before I finally said, this is stupid. Even though he is slippery,\nhe hasn't got a head. I can hold onto him. I put him in my pocket. - Yeah, put him in pocket. - [Paul] And then we fried him up and we. - And he was delicious. So, and I'm grateful for his\nexistence and for his role and for my existence on this planet, this brief existence\nthat I was able to enjoy that delicious, delicious fish. So the machete is used to cut through this extremely dense jungle. There's vines, by the way,\nthere's rope-like things. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- That are extremely strong. And they go all kinds of\ndirections, they go horizontal and all of this, I don't even, how tree, we have a tree right\nabove us that makes no sense. (Paul laughs) There's like a tree that kind of failed and then a new tree was\ncreated on top of it. That makes, it just makes no sense. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- It feels like sometimes trees come from the sky. Sometimes they come from the ground. I don't really quite\nunderstand the, how that works 'cause there's new trees\nthat grow on old trees and the old trees rot away\nand the new trees come up. - Yeah.\n- [Lex] That whole mechanism. - Strangler figs, and so strangler figs, as you go across the world's ecosystems, that whole belt of, you know, whether you're in\nrainforest in the Amazon, the Congo, Indonesia, all across the tropics\nyou have strangler figs. And the amazing thing\nthat this species does, it's become a keystone\nspecies across the planet with a hyper-influence on\nits ecosystem wherever it is because they produce\nfruit in the dry season when the rest of the\nforest is making it hard for animals to find fruit, to find food. And so the bats, the birds, the monkeys, they all go to the strangler fig. They eat the fruit and\nthe fruit of course is just tricking the animals. The plants are tricking the animals into carrying their seeds to another tree. And so they're getting\nfree transportation. Monkey takes a poop on another tree after eating strangler figs and then that strangler\nfig sends out its vines, gets to the ground, and then as soon as it\nbegins sucking up nutrients, out-competes that tree for light, grows hyper-drive around\nthe trunk of that tree. And then eventually that tree will die and the strangler fig will win because it got a boost up to the top. Whereas these little trees down here, they're gonna have to wait their turn. They have to wait until a tree falls until there's a light gap. And then they have enough\nfood to grow quick. And so this whole thing\nis an energy economy. Everything is just trying to get sunlight. And so strangler figs, yeah, top-down trees growing over, parasitic, top-down octopus trees growing over other giant trees. And you've seen the size\nof some of the trees here. - So you know, back to Percy\nFawcett and exploration, what do you think it was\nlike for him back then, 100 years ago, God damn,\ngoing to the jungle? - Well the, see the thing\nis those guys didn't go with the locals.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - They came down here with like mules and they tried to do it their way. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And so he's one of the people that\nwrote about the green hell, the jungle as the oppressive war zone where there's nothing to eat and everything is killing you. And it's, I think that image is so wrong 'cause as you saw last night, we could go, if we went out with JJ right now, we would machete fish some fish, we could start a little fire. We'd do it all in shorts. Like to JJ, it's green paradise. And it's intense but if\nyou know what you're doing, which the local people surely do, well then just beneath the\nsand there's turtle eggs that you can eat. And inside the nuts on the ground there's grubs that you can eat. And if you really needed to, you could just jump on\na caiman and eat that 'cause their tails are\npretty full of meat. And it's like there's actually unending amounts of food here. And so it's, they were pretty, you know, they were a strange bunch. - If you were able to tune\ninto the, that frequency, I feel like your, you and JJ. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Are able to tune to the frequency of the jungle that is a provider, not a destroyer of human life, right? - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Like I think to be collaborated with,\nnot fought against. - Yes, but we're coming at that with a, with our modern lens 'cause we're coming down here with I've survived how many\ninfections in the jungle. - [Lex] Sure.\n- Where those probably would've killed me before. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So my dead ass opinion of the jungle\nwould've been overwhelming and collective murder as Herzog says. And so Percy Fawcett was coming down here with this view of it's trying\nto kill us at all times. But we are flying down here and coming out here with\nour superior medicines and our ability to survive infections. And so it is different\nfor us, it is different. We're coming at this very, very different, but Fawcett to me was like the last of like\nthe real swashbucklers, like the really batshit crazy explorers that just went out into\nthe dark spaces on the map. And it's very hard for\nme to identify with him. But with, for instance, Richard\nEvans Schultes from Harvard, that's someone where you go, okay, now we're getting to the point where I can start to understand. I mean, just like the conquistadors. And they tell you the conquistadors\nshowed up and, you know, they killed, the Spanish killed\n2,000 Inca on the first day. And then they marched to\nthis city and they're like, when I hear about the, can you imagine yourself\njust like slaughtering a bunch of women and children and soldiers and then just like drinking some wine and doing it again tomorrow? - [Lex] Yes.\n- Like, I can't actually wrap my head around that. - Yeah, it just seems like\nan entire different world. - Nah, like different world. - Different value system. - [Paul] Different value system. - A different relationship with\nviolence and life and death. I think we value life more. We value, we resist violence more. - Yeah, like I just, I can't, like if we saw a car accident, I feel like if I saw a car accident, like, you know, or if you\nsee a little bit of war, some violence, like it affects you. These people were so\ncomfortable with those things. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It was such a normal part of their, the Spartans, the Comanches. Like, they became so comfortable with war to the point that it became what they did. - And they celebrated it too. - [Paul] They celebrated it. - And direct violence too. Like, taking that\nmachete and murdering me, or if I got to the machete\nfirst, me murdering you. - Not a chance, bitch. - I, and then I would put it\non Instagram and show off. - [Paul] (indistinct). (Paul and Lex laugh) - And the number of DMs I would get from murdering you with a machete. - Meanwhile, half the world\nright now is messaging me, saying my DMs are filled\nwith take care of Lex, don't lose Lex. Make sure Lex comes back safe. Lex is a national treasure. We love Lex. Make sure he holds a snake.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - The amount of love that is out there. - Meanwhile, I emerge from the jungle, blood around me with a machete and I take over your Instagram account. - He's very humble, he doesn't\nwant to hear about the love. (Paul and Lex laugh) - All right, so what do you\nthink makes a great explorer? Whether it's Percy Fawcett,\nRichard Evans Schultes, by the way, say who\nRichard Evans Schultes is. He's a biologist. So that's another lens through\nwhich to be an explorer. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Is to study the biology, the immense diversity of\nbiological life all around us. - Richard Evan Schultes, I know about him from reading\nWade Davis' book \"One River\", which is this big, hefty, you know, five or 600 page tome about the Amazon. And it covers two stories. It's Richard Evan Schultes\nand I think it's in the '40s, I think it's like pre-World War II era, where he's in the Amazon\nlooking for the blue orchid and the cure for this and that. And he's pressing plants and he's going to these\nIndigenous communities where they still live\ncompletely with the forest. And they drink ayahuasca\nand they talk to the gods and they, he learns\nabout how they believed that the anaconda came\ndown from the Milky Way and swam across the land\nand created the rivers. And sort of, he came down\nand even though he was a Western scientist from Harvard, he embraced the Indigenous\nperspective on the world, on creation, on spirituality. And he sort of resigned himself and gave himself fully to that and spent years and years traveling around parts of the Amazon that\nhad hardly been explored and certainly never been explored in the way he was doing it, in the ethno-botanical, spiritual way of what medicinal compounds\nare contained in these plants and how do the local Indigenous people use and understand them? For example, you know, of\n80,000 species of plants in the Amazon rainforest and 400 billion trees in\nthe Amazon rainforest, the statistics of likelihood that through trial and error that humans could discover ayahuasca, it's astronomical, that one of these trees and\na root when put together allow you to go and\naccess the spirit realm and see hallucinogenic\nshapes and talk to the gods. That's almost enough to inspire spiritual thought itself. The fact that trial and error, it would take like millions\nof years or something. It's, I forget what the figure is. It's incredible, but\nRichard Evan Schultes was one of the first people\nthat came down and saw that. And then \"One River\" is\nwhere Wade Davis comes back, I believe in the '70s, and the heartbreak of the book is that all of these incredibly wild places with naked, native tribes and\nthese intact belief systems, Wade Davis comes back and\na lot of the same places that Schultes went, now there's missionary schools and they're wearing discarded Nikes and you know, whatever. I don't know if there's Nikes in the '70s, but like Western stuff has made it in. They've been contacted, domesticated, forced into Western society. And you know, a lot of them then forget the thousands and thousands of years that have gone into creating the medicinal, botanical knowledge that the Indigenous possess\nabout how to cure ear infections and how to treat illnesses from the medicinal compounds\nflowing through these trees is lost in a single generation\nwith the modernization. - Yeah, he wrote the \"Plants of the Gods: Their Sacred, Healing and\nHallucinogenic Powers\". That is interesting, you mentioned like how to discover that. Like, how do you find\nthose incredible plants, those incredible things\nthat can warp your mind in all kinds of ways? Of course physically heal, but also like take you\non a mental journey. That's interesting. So you don't think trial\nand error is possible? - I was reading about\nayahuasca and they're saying statistically, if, you know, if a bunch, if you put 1,000 humans in the Amazon and gave them villages to live in, 'cause humans are communalist species, it would take tens and\ntens of thousands of years or perhaps even centuries\nbefore even the possibility. It's like that thing, you know, a bunch of chimps on a keyboard, how could they write Hamlet? It's like astronomical\nodds to get to, oh wait, this and this dosed together. And so what the local people believe is that the gods revealed this secret through the jungle to us as\na link to the spirit world. And that that's how we know this, because if they didn't remember\nit from their ancestors, we would have no idea how\nto get this information from the wild. - So I will likely do ayahuasca. What do you think exists in the spirit world that could be found by\ntaking that journey? - I think that ayahuasca is, I can only speak from personal experience. And for me it was as if your brain is a house\nyou've lived in your entire life and it's a big house, it's a mansion and there's many, many rooms that you didn't even know exist, hidden rooms behind the bookshelves, under the floorboards, rooms that you had no idea were there. And some of them are fantastic and some of them are terrifying basements. And ayahuasca takes you\non a journey through that. At its most effective, you sit in front of the\nshaman with the candlelight, with the sounds of the jungle, and you drink the substance. And after that, what happens is the journey is all inside and the shaman's supposed to be able to guide you through that. But in my experience,\nyou're so deep inside, like falling through nebulas out in space, no physical form, or crawling through the jungle. Like, it's like you, it's\nreally, really powerful. Like, it's not like a, it's not like the recreational\ndrugs that everyone does. Like where you go, I did\nmushrooms and I could see, so I could see music like, and I was talking to my\nfriends about, no, no, no. Like, you're face down on\nthe floor usually vomiting, sometimes shitting, you know, having dialogues with the\ncreator and that can be, that can be traumatizing\nas well as amazing. - It's a really good way of looking at it. It's a big house and you get to open doors that you've never had before and discover what rooms\nare there inside you. You ever think about that? Like, that there's parts of yourself you haven't discovered yet, or maybe you've been suppressing? How much are you exploring the shadow? - Oh boy. - [Lex] So say you, me, Carl\nJung and Jordan Peterson are in a deserted island together. - Fuck, I didn't even make my bed today. (Lex laughs) - There's no bed on an island. - Great. I wanna see you and Jordan\nPeterson do ayahuasca together. I think I, that's the thing. Ayahuasca to me, you know, I've kind of told you\nabout like I've experienced some things that really made me believe that there's a benevolent force around us. But to me, ayahuasca was like a, was a ride through the\nscariest parts of the universe to sort of be like, here's what\nit could be like, you know? The, that's where I came up\nwith my idea that, you know, like deep space or just\nspace, outer space, it's just the outside of the video game. And this is it. Because when I was on ayahuasca, I was one of the jungle\ncreatures and I wasn't Paul and I didn't have a name. And for a long time I saw\nmany things and I was, I arrived at this spot in the jungle where there's a big tree and\nall the animals were there and they were all, not in words, not in any language\nthat we can understand, but they were all discussing what to do about the threat and the, and it was all, it was all leaving. It was all flying up and it was fire and the jungle was being destroyed. And it was like, I went, and then after that it was just\nspace and stars and silence, like crushing, vacuum silence for years. And that was terrifying. That was fucking terrifying. When I came back and I had hands, man, I could remember my own name. - You grounded, things are simpler. You're back inside the video game. What are the chances you think we're actually living in a video game? - When you say a video game, it implies that there's a player. Who's the player? Is it God? - No, there's a main player usually, that's not gonna be God. God is the thing that\ncreates the video game. - Oh, so then we're just. - And there's somebody's, there's NPCs, like I'm an NPC, you're an NPC. - Jesus Christ, so I'm the main character. - Yeah, you created me. - Is this like Halo where you\ncan kind of kill the NPCs? 'Cause. (Paul laughs) - I see how you put\nthe machete behind you. - Okay, I think I'm just\ngonna take a stand here. I think that because people, I'm just sick of fucking\nplaying it halfway. I think that because people live indoors in climate controlled boxes in cities far away from nature, they've completely lost track\nof everything that's real and they've started to\nthink that we're living inside of a simulation. Notice that nobody carrying\nan alpaca up a mountain thinks that we're living inside of a video game. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- They all know that it's real - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Because they've had babies on the floor of a cold hut. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- They understand the consequences of life. They understand the fish and\nhow hard it is to get them and the basic rules of the\nwind and the rain and the river and that we all have to play by those. And that it's, and you talk to a, talk to a grieving mother and ask her if she's\nliving inside a video game. And it's like the people, to me, this whole thing of, oh, are\nwe living in a simulation? To me that's a, that's the infirmary of\nsociety starting to that, to starting to parody itself. It's people going, I have no\nmeaning in my life anymore. So is this even real? And again, go ask the\nSherpa, go ask the Eskimo. They're not, they're not worried. - You forget what\nfundamentally matters in life. What is the source of\nmeaning in a human life? If you talk about such subjects. Nevertheless, you could for a time stroll in the big philosophical questions. - [Paul] Sure.\n- And if you do it for short enough of time, you won't forget about\nthe things that matter, that there is human suffering, that there is real human joy that is real. That the, our time in the jungle was very hard. - Did you suffer enough\nto know that it's real? - Yeah, I, man, I was hoping\nwe were in a video game that whole time. - So that's actually a really good way to, there was this moment that I watched where you were washing a\nshirt in this pathetic puddle 'cause we had no water and 'cause we had walked\nall day and tripped all day and gotten thorns in our hands\nand our feet and our legs. And we were lost in the\njungle and was nighttime and we didn't know if a big\ntree was gonna just fall on us and mousetrap kill us. And there's a lot of uncertainty. But I watched something\nvery special happen to you, and that was I saw you crouching\nby the side of this puddle. It wasn't even a flowing\nstream, so we couldn't drink it. And you were just trying to wash the sweat off of your shirt. And you looked at me and you just said, \"The only thing that I care\nabout right now is water.\" - Mm-hmm.\n- And I feel like in that moment we were\nunited in the simple reality of the fact that we were\nso thirsty that it hurt and that it was a little scary. - Yeah, it was scary but also there's like a joy in the interaction with the water because it cools your\nbody temperature down. And there's like a faith\nin that interaction that eventually we'll find clean water because water's plentiful on Earth. It's kind of like a delusional faith. And eventually we'll find, and it was just like a little celebration. I think the cooling aspect of the water, 'cause you know, the body\ntemperature's really high from traversing the really dense jungle. And just the cooling was somehow grounding in a way that nothing else really is. Yeah, it was a little celebration of life, of life on Earth, of Earth,\nof the jungle, of everything. It was a nice, it was a nice moment. I think about that. Had a couple of those. There was one in the puddle\nand one in the river. (Lex laughs) One was full of delusion and fear and the other one was full\nof relief and celebration. - Yeah, I've, you know, there's this thing that\nthey say where the, all the pleasure in life is\nderived from the transitions. When you're cold, warm feels good. When you're hot, cold feels good. When you're hungry, food feels good. And when you're that\nthirsty, water becomes God. And it's all you want. And also, the other thing\nis that when you're, when we're out there, it\nfelt so good to be so lost and so tired and so, like we were doing level, like how would you\ndescribe the physicality of what we were doing? The level of physical like exertion? - Well, it's something\nthat I've haven't trained. I don't even know how you would train for that kind of thing. But it's extremely dense jungle, so every single step is like\ncompletely unpredictable in terms of the terrain\nyour foot interacts with. So the different variety of slippery that is on the jungle floor is fascinating 'cause some things, I\nmean, the slope matters, but some roots of trees\nare slippery, some are not. Some trees in the ground\nalready rotted through so if you step through, you're going to potentially fall through. So it could be a shallow hole or it could be a very deep hole with some leaves and\nvegetation covering up a hole where if you fall through,\nyou could break a leg and completely lose your footing\nor fall rolling downhill. And if you roll downhill, I'm pretty sure there's a 99% probability that you'll hit a thing with spikes on it. (Paul laughs) So there's so many layers\nof avoiding dangers, of small dangers and big\ndangers all around you with every single step. So there's like a mental\nexhaustion that sets in, like the, just the perception. And you're just observing you, you're extremely good at perceiving, having situational awareness, of taking the information\nin that's really important and filtering out the\nstuff that's not important. But even for you, that's exhausting. And for me it was completely exhausting, just paying attention, paying attention to everything around you. So that exhaustion was surprising 'cause it's like there's\nmoments when you're like, I don't give a damn anymore. I'm just gonna step,\nI'm just going to, like. - And so that's it. You go, \"I don't care anymore.\" And you reach out and you go, \"I'm just gonna lean against this tree.\" And then what happened every time?\n- You get spikes in you, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n- And then you have to care. - Yeah and then there's just bad luck because there is wasp nests. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- This is just like a million things. And that is physically, is mentally, psychologically exhausting\n'cause there's the uncertainty. When is this gonna end? It's up in our particular situation, up and down hills, up and down hills. Very steep downward, very\nsteep upward, no water, all this kind of stuff. And it's the most difficult\nthing I've ever done but it's very difficult to describe what are the parameters\nthat make it difficult because I run long distances very regular. I do extremely difficult\nphysical things regularly that on some surface level could seem much more challenging than what we did. But no, this was another beast. This is something else. But it was also raw and real and beautiful 'cause it's like, it's\nwhat the explorers did. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- It's what Earth is without humans. And it, and also just like\nthe massive scale of the trees around us was the humbling size difference\nbetween human and tree. It's both humbling in that\nlike that tree is really old. It's the time difference,\nlifetime difference. And just the scale. It's like, holy shit. We live on an Earth that\ncan create those things. It makes me feel small in\nevery way, that life is short, that my physical presence\non this Earth is tiny. How vulnerable I am. All of those feelings were there. And in that, the physical endurance of traversing the jungle, yeah, was the hardest journey\nthat I remember ever taking. Every step. And then that made making\nit out of the jungle and then made it, the swim in the water that we could drink, that was just pure joy. It was probably one of the\nhappiest moments in my life, just sitting there with you,\nPaul, and with JJ in the water, full darkness, the rain coming down and all just, us all just laughing, having made it through that, having eaten a bit of food before and the absurdity of\nthe timing of all of it, that it somehow worked out. And how we're just three little humans sitting in a river. Just our heads emerged barely above water with jungle all around us. What a life. - That was a real adventure. - [Lex] That was a real adventure. - That was a real one.\n- Yeah. I'll never forget that. So it's a real honor to have shared that. Of course, we had very\ndifferent experiences. When you saw a caiman in that situation, you're like, I have to go meet that guy, that's a friend of mine. - Well, I mean we were in\nthe river in a thunderstorm, just our necks above, we're\nall laughing our asses off. And I mean, we're in the\nriver with the stingrays and the black caiman and the piranha and all the electric eels and everything, and it's pitch black out. And then what were we doing? We were holding our headlamps up? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And there was those swirling moths.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - The infinity moths all making\nthose geometric patterns. And it's like, we're just\nthree ridiculous primates. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- Three friends in a river just laughing.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Because we were safer in that river than we had been in there\nand we were rejoicing. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah.\n- That the thunderstorm was compared to the war zone\nthat we'd been living in, the thunderstorm was safe. And it was, it really\nwas a beautiful moment. - And also the like very\ndifferent life trajectories have taken these three\nhumans into this one place. - [Paul] Yeah. - It's like, what?\n- [Paul] Yeah, true. - It's this universe that would like, 'cause we're kind of like those\nmoths, you know what I mean? Like, where we come from some\nweird place on this Earth and we'd have all kinds\nof shit happen to us and we're all pursuing\nsome shit and some light and we ended up here together\nenjoying this moment. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- That was something else. It just felt absurd. And in that absurdity was\nthis like real human joy and damn, water tasted good. - Oh, water's good, man. Water and those little oranges. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah.\n- Those things and then I would just say like, do you feel like, I feel like running, like\nno matter how much I run, I feel like the, like you run, you do a workout and then you stop. Like maybe people who do\nultras feel this, but like I felt like the, we would, we woke up, it was like, you know, wake up at dawn, 6:00 AM let's start walking, you know? Break camp, go. And it's like pretty much\nyou just don't stop all day. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- And it's level 10 cardio all day long and you're sweating buckets\nand there's no water. It's like, you would never put yourself through that voluntarily. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- You couldn't, you'd never, you would never have\nthe resolve to continue torturing yourself except\nfor that we were trying to make it to the, to freedom, to get out. And it's like the obsession of that, with the compass and the machete\nand the navigating, fuck. - I think there's something\nto be said about like the fact that we didn't think through much of that. - [Paul] No.\n- And we just dived into it. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- I think there was like, there we're like laughing,\nenjoying ourselves moments before and once you\ngo in you're like, oh shit. - [Paul] Oh shit. - And you just come face to face with it. - [Paul] Yeah. - I think that's what, you know, whatever that is in\nhumans that goes to that, that's what the explorers do. The, you know, and the best of them do it to the extreme levels. - Well I think that what we did was to a pretty extreme level because we left the safety of a river, of knowing where we were\nand voluntarily got lost in the Amazon with very\nlittle provisions on an, on a very, now that we're back, I'm, now that we experienced\nwhat we experienced, I really can't stop thinking\nabout how fucking stupid it was that we did that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Because if we had gotten\nlost, Pico was saying to me even if you guys had, if one of you had broken your leg. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- It's, you know, days in either direction. Even if they had sent help for us, help would take how long\nto scour all that jungle? Sound doesn't travel. Even a helicopter, even\nif they looked for us, they wouldn't be able to see us. How would we signal for help? You can't really build\na fire and so it's like if anything had gone wrong, if we'd gone a few degrees\ndifferent to the west, would've taken us two more days. If we'd gotten injured, it'd be carry through that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And so it somehow, only\nafterwards am I really going wow, thank God we got out of this. (Lex laughs) Thank God after I see\nso many people going, \"Make sure nothing\nhappens to Lex Fridman.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I'd be the deadest motherfucker on Earth\nif anything happened. (Paul laughs) - It somehow works out. - It does seem to somehow work out. - Lemme ask you about Jane Goodall, another explorer of a different kind. What do you think about her, about her role in understanding\nthis natural world of ours? - I think that Jane is like\na living historical treasure. Like, I think somehow she's alive, but she's already reached\nthat level where it's like Einstein, Jane Goodall, like\nthere's these incredible minds. And, you know, growing up as a child, my parents would read to me\nbecause I was so dyslexic I didn't learn to read\nuntil I was quite old. And my mom was a big Jane Goodall fan. And all I wanted to hear about was animals and so I would get read\nto about this lady named Jane Goodall, this girl who went to Africa and studied chimps and\nwho broke all the rules and named her study subjects even though that wasn't\nwhat she was supposed to do. And she became this\nincredible advocate for Earth and for ecosystems and for, and she seemed to realize\nas her career went on that teaching children to\nappreciate nature was the key. 'Cause they're going, you know, that thing where she says we don't so much inherit\nthe Earth from our ancestors but borrow it from our children. We're just here, we're\njust passing through. And so if we destroy it, we're dimming the lights on the\nlives of future generations. And so she's been really,\nreally cognizant of that. And she's been a light in the darkness. She's sort of in terms of saying that animals have\npersonalities and culture and their own, inalienable\nrights and reasons for existing and that human life is valuable. She's very big on that. Every day we influence\nthe people around us and the events of the Earth. Even if you feel like your life\nis small and insignificant, that you do have an impact. And I think that's a really\npowerful little candle out there in the darkness that Jane carries. - What do you think about her\nfield work with the chimps? - Badass, the fact that\nshe did what she did at the age that she did. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- At the time that she did. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Is incredible. It's actually incredible. She has that explorer\ngene and she also has that relentless relentlessness, is like this incredible quality. She just, you know, she\ntravels 300 days a year educating people,\ntalking around the world, trying to help bolster conservation now before it's too late.\n- [Lex] Mm-hmm. - And traveling 300\ndays a year is not fun. Traveling at all can be not fun. - So I started reading\nthe \"River of Doubt\" book you recommended to me on Teddy Roosevelt. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- So that guy's badass on many levels, but I didn't realize how\nmuch of a naturalist he was, how much of a scholar of\nthe natural world he was. So that book details his\njourney into the Amazon jungle. What do you find inspiring\nabout Teddy Roosevelt and that whole journey\nof just saying fuck it, of going to the Amazon jungle,\nof taking on that expedition? - Well, I mean Teddy Roosevelt, you could write volumes on\nwhat's inspiring about him. I think that, you know, he was a weak, asthmatic little rich kid that wasn't physically able,\nthat had no self-confidence. And he was very, and he had\npretty severe depression. He had tragedy in his life. And he was very, at least for me, he's been one of the people, like in the, one of the first historical figures who, where he wrote about the\nstruggle to overcome those things and to make himself from being a weak, asthmatic little teenager to sort of strengthening\nhimself and building muscle and becoming this\nbarrel-chested lion of a guy who could be the president,\nwho could be an explorer and one of the rough riders. And he's just, everything he does is so hyperbolically, you know, incredible. To come out of war and have the\nother people you fought with go, \"He, this guy has no fear.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I mean, he must have just been a psychopath and had no fear. And then proving it further was that thing where he was gonna give a\nspeech to a bunch of people and he got shot in the chest. - [Lex] Yeah, and kept speaking. - It went through his spectacle\ncase and through his speech, and even though the bullet\nwas lodged in his chest, this man said, \"Don't hurt\nthe guy that shot me.\" I believe he asked him, \"Why'd you do it?\" And then as he's bleeding\nand in the rain said, \"No, no, no, I'm not going the hospital, I'm gonna keep going with the speech.\" What a badass, that's incredible. - But going to the\njungle on many levels is really difficult for him at that time. There's so many things that could, so many more things even\nthan now that can kill you. All the different infections, everything. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And the lack of knowledge, just the sheer lack of knowledge. So that truly is an expedition, a really, really challenging expedition. So there's lessons about what it takes to be a great explorer from\nthat, the perseverance. How important do you think is\nperseverance in exploration, especially through the jungle? - I think it's all there is. If you hear about the people, and I think that is a\ntremendous metaphor for life because whether you hear\nabout that plane that crashed in the Andes and the people\nwere alone and freezing and they had to eat each other, and some of them made it out. Some of them kept the fire burning. And Teddy Roosevelt voluntarily,\nafter being president, threw himself into the Amazon\nrainforest and survived. Came so close to dying, but survived. And so perseverance is all of it. I mean, that's, I think\nthat's our quality as a human. - So they also mapped,\nso on the biology side, it's interesting.\n- [Paul Yeah. - But they mapped and documented a lot of the unknown\ngeography and biodiversity. What does it take to do that? So when I see you move about the jungle, you're always like, you're\ncapturing a creature, take a picture, write down like so you can find new creatures, find\nnew things about the jungle, document them, sort of a scientific\nperspective on the jungle. But back then there was even less known, much less known about the jungle. So what do you think it takes to document, to map that world, a new,\nunexplored wilderness? - I mean they're clearly\npressing botanical specimens. They're probably shooting birds. And Roosevelt knew how to preserve those specimens. I mean, he really was a\nnaturalist, so he knew exactly. So if he's seeing these animals, to them, whereas we'll take\na picture and identify it, they were harvesting specimens, taking them with them, drying them out. For them, it was totally different. And it could be the first, you know? There's, I don't know,\nI forget what JJ said. There's something like 70\nspecies of ant birds here. And it's like, so how likely\nare you to be the first person to ever see this one species of bird? And so for them. (Paul mimics gunshot) And it's, you have this bird, and so perfectly preserving that specimen. And I think a lot of\nnon-scientific people don't realize that every species from\nblue whale to elephant to blue jay to sparrow, whatever, whatever it is, whatever species we have on record, there are scientific specimens and the first people\nto see them shot them. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- And that's, the museums are filled\nwith these catalogs, preserved birds that these\nexplorers brought back from New Guinea and\nSouth America and Africa and then put into these drawers. And now we labeled them and we said, this is, you know.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - This is red and green macaw, this is scarlet macaw, this\nis brown-crested ant bird. And this is, and it's just,\nthey're just categorized. - That book of birds you have, like, encyclopedia of birds.\n- Yo, the human achievement in these pages. - For people listening, Paul's just flipping through\na huge number of pages. These are just, is this in\nthe Amazon or just in Peru? - This is just here,\nthis is birds of Peru. (Lex laughs) - Dude, pages on pages\nof toucans and aracaris and hummingbirds and ant birds and smokey brown woodpecker\nand tropical screech owl, which we just heard, by the way. It was just, it's endless. Who knew there were so many birds? I had no idea there was so many birds. - Documenting all of that. I mean, there's also,\nwhich we got to experience and you, you're pretty good at also is actually making, understanding and making the\nsounds of the different birds. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- What's your favorite bird song to make? - Undulated tinamou because\nin the crepuscular hours of dawn and dusk, they're usually the ones that make up what is considered by many to\nbe the anthem of the Amazon. - Can you do a little bird for us? (Paul whistles) - That's what a undulated\ntinamou sounds like. And it's usually like, oh, it is getting to be afternoon. And it's kind of, it's almost like hearing church bells on a Sunday. It's like you just,\nthere's something about it. You go ah, there he is. - And like you were\nsaying, it's a reminder. Oh, that's a friend of mine. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Surrounded by friends. - I have so many friends here. - What does take to survive out here? What are some basic principles\nof survival in the jungle? - Cleanliness. I mean really, but we talked about this, but like, you know, keeping, I have so many holes in my skin right now. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Look, I have a mosquito. There we go. I have so many spots that\nI've scratched off of my skin because a mosquito bites\nme and then I scratch it. Or the other big one is that\nI worry that I have a tick. Not deliberately, not\nwith my thinking brain, but my simian brain just\nwants to find and remove ticks and so I scratch. And then if my fingernails get too long, I remove my skin and then those beget, those get infected in the jungle. So staying hyper clean, using soap, like basic stuff. Keeping order to your\nbags, order to your gear. Things in dry bags. Make sure, you know, we did, we explained that we got in the\nriver during a thunderstorm. We didn't explain why we did that because the thunderstorm came\nwhen we had eaten dinner, but we hadn't set up our tents. And so we decided to cover\nour bags with our boats that we had been carrying, our pack wraps that we'd been\ncarrying in our backpacks. so all of our gear would stay dry. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- So the only thing we could do is either sit\nin the rain and be cold or sit in the river and be warm. And so keeping our gear dry, momentary discomfort for future, you know, that was, that to me was an\nincredibly smart calculation to make is you really just, you gotta be smart out here. You can't, you know, not\nrunning out of a headlamp while you're out on the trail and being stuck in that darkness. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It really takes just being a little bit on your toes. And I find that necessity\nof being on your toes is a place that I like to live in. It's just the right\namount of challenge here. - So keeping the gear\norganized and all of that, but also being willing\nto sort of improvise. I've seen you improvise very well 'cause there's so much\nunknowns, there's so many, so much chaos and dynamic aspects that like planning is\nnot going to prevent you from having to face that\nat the end of the day. - No, it's been really funny watching you sort of shed your planning brain. (Lex laughs) Like day one.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It was very much like, so are we gonna, and then I could tell, I could see your, I could see your brow\nsort of furrow when you, I would go, \"I don't know what\ntime we're gonna get there.\" And you'd go, \"Well, just tell me.\" And I'd be like, \"I don't know what the jungle's gonna let us do.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You know? Let's do, let's record\nthe podcast tomorrow. Okay, but we, if it,\nyou know, if it rains, if it gets windy, if a (indistinct) comes, if there's a jaguar with rabies, like anything could happen. Landslides, like anything, literally. - This tree, I mean the\nthing you mentioned, trees falling, that's\na thing in the jungle. - That's a major thing in the jungle. - Holy shit. First of all, a lot of trees fall. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- And they fall quickly and they could just kill you. - They fall quickly, they're huge. We're talking about trees that are like the size\nof school buses stacked. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And connected to other trees with vines so that when they fall, this millennium tree, this\n1,000 year old tree, boom, it shakes the ground, pulls\ndown other trees with it. So if you're anywhere\nnear that for a few acres, you're getting smashed. That's the end of you. And so the jungle, at any\nmoment that you're out there could just decide to delete you. And then the leafcutter\nants and the army ants and the flies and everything, you'll be digested in three days. You'll be gone, gone, no bones, nothing. - Who do you think would eat most of you? - I would hope that like a king\nvulture with a colorful face would just like get in there. - [Lex] Dramatically go in there, just eat the heart.\n- Like right in the ass. Just like nature's metal, just like when they like walk\nin through the elephant's ass. I'd want that on camera trap. I think that would be a great way to go. - And would slowly look up and\njust kind of smile on camera. - Yeah, just rip out your\nintestines and just shake it. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Just victorious over your dead body. - Well, but also honor a friend. That's another way to honor.\n- Yeah, sure. But you know, you just,\nyou look so, you know, your white, naked ass\nlaying there in the jungle, you'd be like face down and shit. (Paul laughs) - That's why you always have to look good. Any moment, a tree could fall on you and a vulture just swoops\nin and eats your heart. - [Paul] That's right. - We talked about\n\"Alone,\" this show a bit. - Yo, Rock House.\n- Yeah, who is, what do you think about that guy? Rock House, Roland\nWelker from season seven. He built a rock house. He killed a muskox with bow and arrow and then finished it with a knife. (Paul growls) - And had the GoPro mount to, you know? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- To document it. That's a really mind-blowing. I mean, so for people\nwho don't know that show is you're supposed to\nsurvive as long as possible. On season seven of the show, they literally said you can only win it if you survive 100 days. And that's, there's a lot\nof aspects of that show that's difficult, one of which is it's in the cold. The other is they get just\na handful of supplies, no food, nothing, none of that, so they have to figure all of that out. And this is probably one\nof the greatest performers on the show, Roland Welker. He built a rock house shelter. So what, I mean, what\ndoes survival entail? It's building a shelter, fire, catching food, staying warm, getting enough energy to\nsort of keep doing the work. It takes a lot of work. Like building the rock house, I read that it took 500\ncalories an hour from him. - [Paul] Whoa.\n- So he had to feed himself, right, quite a lot. You're lifting 200 pound boulders and still the guy lost I read 44 pounds, which is 20% of his body weight. So that's survival. What lessons, what inspiration do you draw from him? - I think he was fun to watch because he had this indomitable spirit. He was just, he wasn't there\nto commune with nature. He was there to win. And he was like, to me\nthat's the pioneer mentality. He just, he was just, he\ngoes, \"I'm a hunting guide. I'm out here, I'm gonna win that money. I'm gonna survive through the winter.\" He wasn't worried. I feel like so many people are like, they worry, second guessing themselves. Am I in a video game? I don't know. What's my, you know, just questioning their\nentire existential identity. And this guy was like, you know what? There's a muskox over there. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- I'm gonna shoot it. I'm gonna stab it and then\nI'm gonna make a pouch out of its ballsack and\nI'm gonna live off that for the next few months and\nwin a half a million dollars. And that's an amazing\namount of pragmatic optimism that I just enjoyed.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And every time he would go, \"We gotta get back to Rock House.\" And it became.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Even though he is all alone, it was, he had a big smile on his face. And what made that season\nso great was that it was him and then it was Callie. And Roland had, you know, the muscle and could make Rock House. And then Callie was the opposite. She was this girl who, yeah,\nshe could hunt with her bow and she knew how to fish and\nshe wasn't using raw power. But what was so endearing about her was that how much she loved being out there, as hard as it was and as\nisolationist as it was, she was smiling every time, every time the show cut\nto her, she was like, \"Hey everybody, it's morning. Can you believe the frost?\" Like, you've been out there for 100 days. Amazing, I think it was\nreally an amazing show of that the game is all here. The game of life. The game of alone and the game of life because it's the same thing. - Yeah, she maintained\nthat sort of silliness, the goofiness all through it. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- When the conditions got really tough and she had a\nvery different perspective. As you know, Roland didn't\nwant any of the spirituality. He was very pragmatic.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - And from Callie's, very spiritual connection to the land. She said something like she wanted not only to take from the\nland, but to give back. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- I mean there's this kinda. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Poetic, spiritual connection to the land as such a\ndire contrast to Roland. And, but she's still a badass. I mean, to survive, no matter what, no matter the kind of\npersonality you have, you have to be a badass. I think she took a porcupine quill from her shoulder. - That was crazy 'cause it, I think it went in.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Somewhere completely different and it migrated to her shoulder. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And the way I understood that is because they have,\nI said that's impossible. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Because I remember that, she's like pulling up\nher shirt and she's like, there's something. And then she like pushes it out. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And I remember like, I was like, hold up, hold\nup, hold up, hold up. How?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And it was because the\nbarbs, once it goes in, as you move and flex your body, it moves a little bit each time\nand it gets, migrate, like. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I didn't even think of that shit.\n- Plus, if I remember correctly, I think she\ncaught two porcupines. The second one was like rotting\nor something, or infected, it had an infected body, whatever. - Had the spots on it, yeah.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - She chose not to eat it. - No and then she chose\nnot to eat it at first and then she decided to eat it eventually. - [Paul] Yeah, I forgot that. - Yeah, and she, that was an insane sort of really thoughtful, focused, collected decision, waiting a day and then saying, \"Fuck it, I need this fat.\"\n- [Paul] I need this. - And that was the other thing\nis like, fat is important. - [Paul] Oh yeah. - It's like meat is not enough. You learn about like what are the different food sources there? Apparently there's like\nrabbit starvation is a thing because when you have too much lean meat, it doesn't nourish the body. Fat is the thing that nourishes the body, especially in cold conditions. So that's a thing.\n- Yeah, she was incredible and I thought as brash and\nsort of fun as Roland was, she represented a much\nmore beautiful take on it. And it was really\nheartbreaking when she lost 'cause I mean, and like\nyou said, still a badass. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It's kind of like Forrest Griffin versus Stephan Bonner. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Like, it was like it doesn't matter who won. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- You guys beat the shit out of each other, like. - [Lex] And she didn't really lose, right? - No.\n- She got evaced. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Because her toe was going. - Frostbite.\n- Frostbite, 100 days. You think you can do 100 days? - Honestly, I've done a, I've. (Lex laughs) I'm 18 years in the Amazon, man. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- I just, at this point it's, I could.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I wouldn't sign up for\nanother 100 days, you know? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- At this point, I don't have that to prove. I've survived in the wild and I wouldn't want to\nvoluntarily take 100 days away from everyone I know. - Yeah, the loneliness aspect is tough. - We're not meant for that. I really love the people I have in my life and I wouldn't, and you see it on the show. A lot of the people.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Big, tough ex-Navy SEALs who are survival experts\nwho know what they're doing. They get out there and they go, \"You know what? I miss my family.\"\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And they go, \"It's not worth it.\" They have this existential realization. They go, \"We only got, I only got so many years here. Like let's, this is crazy. It's just some money, fuck it.\" And they go home. - You know what's funny? 'Cause you sometimes feeling\nyourself in the jungle when you're alone. And there's another guy, Jordan Jonas, Hobo Jordo, he's the season six winner. And he said that the camera\nmade him feel less lonely. I've heard of him from multiple channels. One of the things is he\nspent all of his 20s in, living in Siberia with\nthe tribes out there. - [Paul] Whoa. - Herzog, \"Happy People\". - [Paul] Mm.\n- And so he actually talked about that it's one of the\nloneliest time of his life because when he went up there, he didn't speak Russian and he\nneeded to learn the language. And even though you\nhave people around you, when you don't speak their language, it feels really, really lonely. And he felt less lonely on the show 'cause he had the camera and he felt like he\ncould talk to the camera. - [Paul] Interesting.\n- There is an element when you have in these harsh conditions, if you like record something, you feel like you're talking\nto another human through it even if it's just a recording. I sometimes feel that like, maybe 'cause I imagine a specific person that will watch it and I feel like I'm\ntalking to that person. - Well, I noticed that when\nthings got especially hard, and they did get especially hard when we were out in the wilderness, that you would begin filming to share that struggle. But I also think that\nI've used that at times where yeah, you go, well maybe if I, 'cause if you can tell\nsomeone else about it, then you're on the hero's journey. And then it sort of has to make you braver and it changes how you, 'cause you go, I'm cold and I'm tired and I'm hungry and this hurts and that hurts and I don't know when we're gonna make it and how is this gonna go? And all of a sudden you go, well guys, we're here\nand we're going that way. (Lex laughs) And then you're like,\nwell I gotta keep going. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- 'Cause you're like, they're still out there if you forget. - You have to step up. That's one of the reasons I want a family. I think when you have kids.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - You have to be like, you have to be the best version\nof yourself like for them. - All my friends with kids\nthat I've seen them go through, where until you have a family, you're just playing around, man. I mean, you could do important work. You can have skin in the, in other games, but it's, once you have a little tribe of humans\nthat depends on you. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- If you take that seriously, if you want to do that right, it's one of the hardest\nthings you could do. And it just, it just changes everything. - How has your life\nchanged since we last met? - Speak about changing everything. - So you've been, for\npeople who don't know, pushing Junglekeepers forward\ninto uncharted territories, saving more and more and\nmore and more rainforests. There's a lot I could ask you about that. There's a lot of stories to be told there. It's a fight, it's a battle, it's a battle to protect this beautiful area of rainforest, of nature. But since we last met, you've made, you've continued to\nmake a lot of progress. So what's the story of Junglekeepers? Leading up to the moment we met and after and everything you're\ngoing, doing right now? - 18 years ago when I\nfirst came to the jungle, I was a kid from New\nYork who always dreamed since I was six years\nold, maybe even younger, of going to a place where\nanimals were everywhere and there's big trees\nand skyscrapers of life. And so being dyslexic and\nnot fitting in in school and reading about Jane Goodall and having \"Lord of the Rings\" be one\nof the things I grew up on, I just chose to come to the Amazon. And the first person I met was this local, Indigenous\nconservationist named Juan Julio Durand, who was trying to protect\nthis remote river, the Las Piedras River, which in history, apparently\nFawcett referenced either the Las Piedras,\nbut he called it Tahuamanu and said, \"Don't go there.\" (Lex laughs) \"You'll surely die from tribes.\" - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And so there's very few references to this river in history. It's stayed very wild\nbecause it's been a place that the law hasn't made it, the government hasn't really extended to, like, you know, we're sort\nof past the police limit. And so JJ was out here ages ago trying to protect this river\nbefore it was too late. And when I met him, I was just a barely out of high school kid with a dream of just\nseeing the rainforest, let alone seeing a giant anaconda or having any sort of\nmeaningful experience or contribution to the narrative. And somehow over all\nthe years that we began working together and sparked a friendship and began exploring and\ngoing on expeditions and bringing people to the rainforest and asking them for help and manifesting the hell\nout of this insane dream that we had. I mean, we didn't even have a boat. We would take logs down the river. We would have to cut a tree down every time we wanted to return to civilization. We'd have to cut down a balsa\ntree and float down the river. - [Lex] Float down the river on it, yeah. - It was, it's madness. Like, it's madness, it's pure madness. And I don't know what made us keep going, but along the way, people\nshowed up who cared and who wanted to help. And if it was a movie, it\nwouldn't even necessarily be a good movie 'cause you'd go, oh, please, you're just telling me that\nyou just kept doing the thing and just magically people showed up. But yeah, that's what happened. That's exactly the way it went. We kept doing the thing that we loved. We said, \"It doesn't matter\nif we don't have funding or a boat or gasoline\nor friends or anything.\" We just kept going. And along the way we found\nsomeone who could help us start a ranger program. And then we found Dax Dasilva, who helped us fund the\nbeginning of Junglekeepers. And then people like Mohsin\nand Stefan who were there making sure that this\nthing actually took flight off the ground. And then right around the\ntime that we were wondering what was gonna happen and if we're all gonna have\nto quit and get real jobs and if we could actually\nsave the rainforest from the destruction that was coming, Lex Fridman sends me a DM and honestly changed the entire narrative. Because up until then we had been, we'd been playing in the minor leagues, pretending, trying real, real hard. And the listeners of your show in the moments after you\npublished your episode with our conversation\nbegan showing up in droves and supporting Junglekeepers, putting in five, 10, 100, 1,000. We started getting these donations and the incredible team that I work with, we all went into hyperdrive. Everybody, everybody started going nuts. We all started spending\n16 hour days working to try and deal with the tidal wave that Lex sent towards us. Just 'cause so many people\nknew that we were doing this, that was an Indigenous-led\nfight to protect this incredibly ancient, virgin rainforest before it was cut. And people resonated with that. And so we got this huge swell of support. And this year, we've protected thousands and thousands of\nmore acres of rainforest because of that swell of support. - So current 50,000\nacres, what's the goal? What's the approach to\nsaving this rainforest? - Since we printed this,\nit's gone up to 66,000 acres. It's, and as you know, in each\nof those little acres are millions and millions of animal heartbeats and societies of animals. And the goal here is that we're\nbetween Manu National Park, Alto Purus National Park, the Tambopata Reserve. We're in a region that's known as the biodiversity capital of Peru, one of the most biodiverse\nparts of the Western Amazon. And we're fighting along the edge of the Trans-Amazon Highway. And so it's just a small\ngroup of local people and some international\nexperts who have come together and used these incredibly out\nof side of the box strategies to sort of crowdfund conservation, to go, look, we know that\nthis incredible life is here. We have the scientific evidence, we have the national park system. If we can protect this\nbefore they cut it down, we could do something\nof global significance. All these jaguars, all these monkeys, all these undescribed medicines, the uncontacted tribes that\nwe share this forest with, could all be protected. And people have stepped up\nand begun to make that happen. And there's people from all over the world and it's incredible. - But what's the approach? So trying to, with donations, to buy out more and more of the\nland and then protect it. - So the approach is that currently the\ngovernment favors extractors. So if you're a gold miner\nor an illegal logger, or you just want to cut down\nand burn a bunch of rainforests and set up a cacao farm, the\ngovernment's fine with that. It doesn't matter. You're not really breaking\nthe law if you destroy nature. - So as long as you're producing\nsomething from the land, they don't see it as a loss the nature was destroyed permanently. - Yeah, it's just wilderness. It's sort of just beyond the scope of, it's not, doesn't, or the local people that\ntechnically own the land out here, the local Indigenous people, for instance, we fought this year to help the community of Puerto Nuevo, who's been fighting for 20 years to have government recognized land. These are Indigenous people in the Amazon fighting to protect their own land. And you know what it was\nthat was holding 'em back? They didn't understand how the system of legal documents worked to certify that titled land. They didn't really have the funding to go from their very, very remote\ncommunity into the offices. And so Junglekeepers\nhelped them with that. And so really all we're doing is helping local people protect the forest that is their world. That's it.\n- If people donate, how will that help? - If people donate to Junglekeepers, what you're doing is you're helping someone like JJ, who's an Indigenous\nnaturalist who has the vision, who has seen forest be destroyed, he's trying to protect\nit before it's too late. You're saving mahogany\ntrees, ironwood trees, kapok trees, skyscrapers of life, just monkeys, birds, reptiles, amphibians, birds, mammals, this entire Avatar on\nEarth world of rainforest that produces a fifth\nof the oxygen we breathe and the water we drink, this incredible thing. As far as I know, it's the most\ndirect way to protect that. And so the fact that, the fact that we've, you know, we have large funders\nwho give us, you know, $100,000 to protect\nthis huge swath of land. And that goes through things like this and through Instagram, it, you know, it goes directly to the\nlocal conservationists who work with the loggers\nto protect that land before it's cut. But one of the most impactful\nthings that has happened this year in the wake of\nour last conversation was that I got an email from\na mother and she said, \"You know, I'm a single\nmom and I work a few jobs and I can't afford to\ngive you a ton of money, but me and my kids look at your\nInstagram often after dinner and they really want to\nprotect the heartbeats. They really wanna protect the\nanimals and the rainforest. And so we do, we give $5\na month to Junglekeepers.\" And it was, to me that was so impactful because I used to be that little kid, worried about the animals. And I saw how a few million\nraindrops can create a flood. - Yeah, I ask that people donate to Junglekeepers. You guys are legit. That money's going to go a long way. Junglekeepers.org. If you somehow were able\nto raise very large, so the raindrops would make a waterfall, a very large amount of money. I don't know what that number is. Maybe $10 million, 20 million, 30 million, what are the\ndifferent milestones along the way that could really help, help you on the journey\nof saving the rainforest? - If we did, if let's just\nsay some company organization or if enough people donated it, let's just say we got that 30 million, that money would go directly\ninto stopping logging roads, into creating a corridor, a biological corridor that connects the uncontacted Indigenous\nreserves with other tribal lands, with Manu National Park,\nwith the Tambopata, which establishes essentially\nthe largest protected area in the Amazon rainforest. And what makes this groundbreaking is that we're not doing this\nin the traditional way. We're doing this, take it to the people. And that's what's been so\nexciting is that, you know, when he started this, when JJ started this 30 years ago, he had no idea. His father wanted him to be a logger. He didn't have shoes\nuntil he was 13 years old. He grew up bathing in the river. He had no idea that a bunch\nof crazy foreigner scientists were gonna show up and some guy in a James Bond suit was gonna come down here with microphones and that all of a sudden\nthe world would know that he was on this quest to protect this incredible ecosystem\nand all those little aliens. - Well, that's all the\nimportant thing to remember, that the people that are\ncutting down the forest, the loggers are also human\nbeings that have families. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- They're basically trying to survive and they're desperate and they're doing the thing\nthat will bring them money. And so they're just human beings. At the core of it, if\nthey have other options, they will probably\nchoose to give their life to saving the community, to first and foremost\nproviding for their family, and after that, saving the community, helping the community flourish. And I think probably a lot\nof them love the rainforest. They grew up in the rainforest. - Yeah, I mean, look at Pico. - [Lex] Yeah. - Pico used to be a logger, full-time logger, long-time logger. Now he loves conservation. He goes (speaks foreign language) (Lex laughs) He's like, you know?\n- Yeah. It's all about just\nproviding people options. There's some dark stuff on the gold mine stuff you've talked about. You showed me parts of the rainforest where the gold mines are and they're just kind of\nerasing the rainforest. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- Sort of at the edges. That's when the mining happens and it's this ugly, ugly process of they're\njust destroying the jungle just for the surface layer of the sand or whatever that they process to collect just little bits of gold. And there's also very\ndark things that happen along the way as the communities\naround the gold mines are created so that the\nentirety of the moral system that emerges from that has\nthings like prostitution, where one third of the women that are drawn into that sex\ntrafficking, prostitution are minors under, you know,\nunder 17 years old, 13 to 17 year old. There's just a lot of\nreally, really dark stuff. - I think that we have a rare chance to do something\nagainst that darkness. I think that this is an example\nof local people who have taken action, done good work, been good to the people that have visited, harnessed a certain amount\nof international momentum. And now we're on the cusp\nof doing something historic. And so for the children in the\ncommunities along this river, it won't be being a\nprostitute in a gold mine. It'll be becoming a trained ranger. Like last month, our ranger coordinator and one of our female\nrangers went to Africa for a ranger conference. And it's like we're beginning to, this is someone from\na little, tiny village with thatched huts up river. She went to Africa to talk about being a professional conservation ranger. And it's like that's changing lives. And her daughters then, she's married to Ignacio, the guy. - [Lex] Mm-hmm.\n- She, like her, their kids are gonna grow\nup seeing their parents walking around with the emblem on and go, \"Oh, I wanna\", and then\npeople like Pico and Pedro and all these guys that\nwork here are gonna go, \"Well, we have to protect this forest.\" And then they start getting\nfascinated about the snakes and then they start caring\nabout the turtle eggs and then all of a sudden\nthey have a way of life. And nobody needs to go be, nobody can, nobody needs to go steal anybody's kids to be a prostitute in a gold mine. That's horrible. And so it's really a, it's\na win-win for the animals, for the river, for the\nrainforest, for people. We're improving, it's\nbiocentric conservation. It's just making everything better. - Yeah, I've read in an article that said an estimated 1,200 girls\nbetween ages of 12 and 17 are forcibly drafted into child prostitution around the communities in the gold mines. At least one third of the prostitutes in the camp are underage. - Oh.\n- The girls had ended up in the camp after receiving a tip that there were restaurants\nlooking for waitresses and willing to pay top dollar. They jumped on a bus together and came down to the rainforest. What they found was not\nwhat they were expecting. The mining camp restaurants served food for only a few hours a day. The rest of the time it\nwas the girls themselves who were on the menu. Literally at the end of the road and without the money to return home, the girls would soon become\ntrapped in prostitution. - It's interesting to me that the most devastating destruction of nature, the complete erasure of the rainforest, burned to the ground, sucked through a hose, spit out into a disgusting mercury puddle, like the complete\nannihilation of life on Earth goes hand in hand with\nthe complete annihilation of a young life. It's like, it's all based\naround the same thing. It's the light versus the dark. That's, it's the destruction and the chaos versus a move towards order and hope and it is incredibly dark and this region is heavy with it. - Well, I'm glad you're\nfighting for the light. Is there like a milestone\nin the near future that you're working towards, like financially in terms of donations? - There is. In the next year and a half,\nas you saw in your time here, there's roads working around the Junglekeepers' concessions. All the work that the\nlocal people are doing to protect this land is\ntrying to be dismantled by international corporations that are subcontracting\nlogging companies here. And really what we need is $30\nmillion in the next two years to protect the whole thing. You've seen the ancient mahogany trees, you've seen the families of monkeys, you've seen the caiman in the river. All of this is standing in\nthe pathway of destruction. That road, they're gonna\ncome down that road and men with chainsaws\nare going to dismantle a forest that has been\ngrowing since the beginning. This is so magical. Do you see the snake over there? - Yeah.\n- [Paul] Do you? - There's a snake. - Okay, I'm just gonna, don't move. I don't want you to move. I'm gonna just, this is one of the most beautiful snakes in the Amazon rainforest. This is the blunt-headed tree snake. One of my favorite snakes. I've been hoping that you\nwould get to see this snake. I have been praying. - Oh boy. - Okay, okay, let's just go right back into this. Look at this little beauty creation. Let's keep you away from the fire. Look at this little blunt-headed tree snake. - [Lex] Wow.\n- Such an incredible. - [Lex] So tell me about this snake. - Harmless little snake. If you put your hand out, he'll probably just crawl onto your hand. Just be real careful with the fire. So look, I'm just gonna put\nhim like this and we're gonna yeah, let's just snake safety. So he's a tree snake. Yeah, nice and slow, nice\nand slow, nice and slow, so you nice and slow, just really slow. Just be the tree, be the\ntree that he climbs on. And this is like, again, this is a snake that's\nso thin and so small. There you go, there you go, nice and slow. Just be the tree, let him crawl around. So he is gonna try and do all this stuff. Let me see if I can just\ncalm him down for a sec. Lemme just see. He's very active little snake. So see, like the snake the other night, okay, just, gosh, look at this. I can see the light through his body. To me, this is an alien. This is this strange little life form. His eyes are two thirds of his head. I'm not joking, you look at their skull. - [Lex] He's so tiny.\n- He's so tiny. - For people listening, there's a snake in Paul's hands right now. It is very, it's long of course, but very skinny. - Very, very skinny.\n- [Lex] Very light. - And the also for everyone listening, the odds of that as we're sitting here doing this podcast, that a snake would just be\ncrawling by in the jungle might sound like something\nthat would happen but the density of snakes\nin the Amazon rainforest makes this a very unique experience. - Can you tell me a little bit\nabout the coloration scheme? - [Paul] Yeah, so.\n- A little bit brown. - Yeah just to describe this\nas we were talking here, it's just a sort of banded\nwhite and brown snake with this tiny, little head\nabout the size of my pinky nail. Two thirds of this snake's\neye, head is made up of its gigantic eyes. It's got a small mouth and it's about a third as thick as a pencil. It's basically a moving shoestring. It's incredibly, incredibly thin. The only thing I am thinking,\nLex, though, is that if we have Dan come and\njust do some shots of. - [Lex] Yeah, that's true.\n- Dan. - [Lex] So what are we looking at here? - The snake that was crawling\nbehind us in the jungle that I, we were talking\nabout Junglekeepers and what we could do. And this snake just\nshowed up at that moment. And this is a very active little snake who's out for a hunt tonight and wants to find something to eat. So this is a blunt-headed tree snake. Totally harmless, little, literally a moving shoestring. Super beautiful little animal. When you talk about aliens,\nto me this is an alien. Like, what are you thinking? What are you doing right now? What do you think about the\nfact that we are handled, being handled by these giant humans? - [Lex] And as you were saying,\nit reaches up to the leaves, you get closer.\n- Yeah, the snake just naturally knows to go, look. You just put 'em anywhere\nnear leaves and he is like, I got this. He just wants to go\nright up into that tree. I just want you to try holding him and real gentle just be the tree. Yeah, and just kind of do the same thing you learned last night,\njust nice and gentle. Yeah, and see he's holding\nonto my finger right now. He is just going up, there you go. Perfect, nice and easy. He's a little erratic,\nhe's a little goofy. - Maybe he's camera shy. Maybe a fan of the podcast and gigantic eyes\nrelative to his body size. - [Paul] Huge. - Oh, hello moth.\n- [Paul] Jeez. - Traffic, traffic in the jungle. - And then for everyone listening, as we're handling the snake that we found that was crawling by us, like literally by our shoulders, as we're talking, a bat flies through, no joke, eight inches from Lex's ear, like just zips past his head as he's holding a snake\nwhile we're sitting here in the jungle is just, we're just in it now. Now he is gonna try and back up. - And how do you.\n- [Paul] Yeah, why don't you, let's encourage him to come back this way. - He's weaved this way. - [Paul] He's okay, he's okay. He's just trying to back up. Yeah, right there, release. - Oh, release. - Okay I'm gonna, this\nis what I'm gonna do. We're gonna say thank you, Mr. Snake. - [Lex] Thank you, Mr. Snake. - Thank you, Mr. Snake. Back up into the tree. Here we go, there you go,\nthere you go, there you go. And then we can resume\nnormal podcasting now. (Lex laughs) 'Cause our.\n- [Lex] We really are in the jungle right now. - We really are in the jungle. That's one of my favorite snakes. That's one of my favorite\nlittle aliens on this planet. Look at that. - [Lex] And it's going on some\nlong journey that's gonna. - Up into the canopy. - Carry the rest of the night. So that little snake\nis one of the millions of life forms, heartbeats\nthat you're trying to protect. - Exactly. To me, I, after almost 20 years down here, the people here have become my friends, the caiman on the river, the monkeys. I, when I fall asleep at night, I think about all the\ndifferent heartbeats, all the different little creatures here that when they bulldoze this forest, when they chop down these\ntrees, that they vanish, that we take away their world. And in that very\nevolutionary, historical sense of remembering the primordial soup, it's like this, these,\nthis little creature surviving out here somehow. And we have the chance to save it. And even if you don't care\nabout the little creature on the pale blue dot, each of these little creatures contributes to this massive orchestral\nhole that creates climactic stability on this planet. And the Amazon is one of the\nmost important parts of that. And each of these little guys\nis playing a role in there. - So one of the other\nfascinating life forms is other humans, but living a\nvery different kind of life. So uncontacted tribes, what do you find most\nfascinating about them? - What I find most fascinating\nabout the uncontacted tribes is that while me and you are sitting here with microphones and a light, somewhere out there in that darkness, in that direction, not so\nfar away as the crow flies, there are people sitting\naround a fire in the dark, probably with little more than\na few leaves over their heads who don't even have\nthe use of stone tools, who only have metal\nobjects that they've stolen from nearby communities. They're living such primitive,\nisolated nomadic lives in the modern world, and they're still living\nnaked out in the jungle. It's truly incredible,\nit's truly remarkable. And I think that it's because they can't\nadvocate for themselves, they can't protect themselves,\nit's sort of like, well, we can let them get shot up by loggers and get their, let their land\nget bulldozed while they hide. They have no idea that their\nworld is being destroyed. But they're sort of the scariest and most fascinating\nthing out there right now in the jungle. - What do you think they're, 'cause you've spoken about\nthem being dangerous. What do you think their\nrelationship with violence is? - [Paul] I think there's.\n- Why is violence part of their approach\nto the external world? - So from the best I understand it, that at the turn of the\ncentury, industrial revolution, we had sudden immense need for rubber for hoses and gaskets and wires and tires and the war machine. And the only way to get\nrubber was to come down to the Amazon rainforest\nand get the local people who knew the jungle to\ngo out into the jungle and cut rubber trees\nand collect the latex. And Henry Ford tried doing Fordlandia, tried having rubber plantations, but leaf blight killed it. And so you had this period\nof horrendous extraction in the Amazon where the\nrubber barons were coming down and just raping and pillaging the tribes and making them go out to tap these trees. And the uncontacted tribes said no. They had their six foot long longbows, seven foot long arrows\nwith giant bamboo tips. And they moved further back\ninto the forest and they said, \"We will not be conquered.\" And since that time,\nthey've been out there and it's confusing because in a way, they're still running\nscared a century later. And their grandparents\nwould've told them, you know, the outside world, everyone\nyou see in the outside world is trying to kill you, so kill them first. So can you blame them for being violent? No. Is this river still wild because loggers were scared to go here? For a long time, for\nalmost a century late. That's why this forest is still here, yes. And so is it a human rights\nissue that we protect the last people on Earth\nthat have no government, no affiliation, no language\nthat we can explain? We don't know what their\nmedicinal plant knowledge is. We don't know their creation myths. We know nothing about them. And they're just out there\nright now with bows and arrows living in the dark,\nsurviving in the jungle, naked without even spoons. Forget about the wheel,\nforget about iPhones. They got nothing and\nthey're making it work. - We don't know their creation myths. So they have a very primitive existence. Well, do you think their values, first of all, do you think\ntheir nature is similar to ours? And how do their values differ from ours? - This is complicated because the anthropologist in me wants to say that they have a historical\nreason for the violent life that they have. You know, they experienced\nincredible generational trauma some time ago. And that, and because\nthey've been living isolated in the jungle, that has permeated\nto become their culture. They've become a culture of violence. But yet the contacted,\nmodern Indigenous communities that we work with, that are\nmy friends that work here, just the other day we were\nspeaking to one of them who was pulling spikes out of your hand while he was explaining\nthat he tried to help them. The brothers, (speaks foreign language), he tried to help them. He tried to give them a gift. And what did they do? They shot him in the head. - Yeah, he said, \"They're our brothers.\" And he tried to give them a bananas.\n- [Paul] Mm-hmm, plantains. - Plantains, boat full of plantains. And they shot at him. - They shot three arrows at him and one of them actually\nhit him in the skull and put him in the hospital, and he got helicopter\nevacuated from his community. And so he's brave for surviving, but he's a lucky survivor. They are incredibly accurate with those bamboo-tipped arrows and those arrows are seven feet long. So when you get hit by one, they come at a velocity\nthat can rip through you. And the range on a shotgun is way shorter than the range on a longbow. You're talking about a couple\nhundred meters on a longbow. And they're deadly accurate. They can take spider\nmonkeys out of a tree. And so there's stories of loggers, and I've seen the photos\nof the bodies of loggers who attract, who attacked\none of the tribes. And the tribes hadn't done anything but these loggers came around a bend, they started shooting\nshotguns at the tribe, and the tribes scattered into the forest. And as the loggers'\nboat went around a bend, they just started flying arrows, took out the boat driver,\nboat skidded to the side and then everybody was\nstanding in the river and you can't run. And the tribe just descended on them and just porcupined them full of arrows. - Shotgun versus bow. There's a shotgun shell here, by the way. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- From the loggers. - Mm-hmm, yeah, we\npicked that up yesterday. Was that yesterday? - That was, I don't know. - [Paul] I don't know, I think it was yesterday.\n- One of the things that happens here is time loses meaning in some kind of deep way that it does when you're in a big\ncity in the United States, for example, and there's\nschedules and meetings and all this kind of stuff. It transforms the meaning,\nyour experience of time, your interaction with time,\nthe role of time, all of this. I've forgotten time and I've forgotten the\nexistence of the outside world. - And how does that feel? - It feels more honest. It also puts in perspective\nlike all the busyness, all the, it kind of takes the ant out\nof the ant colony and says, \"Hey, this, you're just an ant and this is just an ant colony. And there's a big world out there.\" Yeah, it's a chance to be grateful, to celebrate this Earth of ours and the things that\nmake it worth living on, including the simple things that make the individual life worth\nliving, which is water, and then food and the\nrest is just details. Of course, the friendships\nand social interaction. That's a really big one, actually. That one I'm taking for granted 'cause I didn't get a chance\nyet to really spend time alone. - [Paul] Hmm.\n- And when I came here, I've gotten a chance to hang out with you. And there's a kind of camaraderie, there's a friendship there\nthat if that's broken, that's a tough one too. And you spent quite a lot\nof time alone in the jungle. You ever get alone out here? - Yeah, yeah. I mean, the first 15\nyears we were doing this, we, there would be times that JJ would be busy in town with his family. And I would, for sheer\nlove of the rainforest, I would have to come alone out here. And we didn't have running, I didn't have running\nwater, I didn't have lights. All I had was a couple of\ncandles in the darkness and a tent and I was\n20-something years old, living in the Amazon by myself. Your boat sunk. And yeah, it's incredibly lonely. I had to learn through experience 'cause I thought there was a period, I think when you're,\nyou know, you're young, as a young man, I had this thing like I wanted to prove that I\ncould be like the explorers. I wanted to prove that I\ncould handle the elements, that I could go out alone, that I could have these\ndeep, connective moments with the jungle. And it's like, I did\nthat and that's great. And you know what the kid\nfrom \"Into the Wild\" learned right before he died in that bus? That if you don't have\nsomebody to share it with, it doesn't matter. - But on some kind of like, even just deep, human level, like even if you have\nsomebody to share it with, you ever just get alone out here? Just like this sense of\nlike existential dread of like what, you know, the jungle has a way of not caring about any individual organism because it just kinda turns, it's like, it makes you realize that life is finite quite intensely. - Hmm. For me, it's comforting being out here 'cause I find the rat race,\nthe national narrative, the need to make money,\nthe, to worry about war, to be outraged about the newest thing that that politician said\nand what that actor did, and it just, there's always\njust this just unending sort of media storm. And everyone's worried and\neveryone's trying to optimize their sunlight exposure\nand find the solution and buy the right, new thing. And to me coming out here, first of all, I mean something out here 'cause I can help someone. I can help people, I\ncan help these animals. And so I find my meaning out here. But also, you know, there's\nthe losing the madness over the mountains. It's nature has always\nand for many people been where things make sense. And to me, I think I'm a\nsimple analog type of person that it makes sense that when it rains, you get in the river to\nstay warm and you know, you wait for the dawn and\nyou see a little tree snake and you see it just, it makes more sense. And I think that the\noverwhelming, teeming complexity that is inside the ant\nmound of society can be dizzying for some people. And I think that maybe it's the dyslexia, maybe it's just that I love nature. But now if I, when I land in JFK, I feel like a frightened animal on like a. (Lex laughs) It is as if you released like a, some animal that had\nnever seen it onto like, into Times Square. And you could just imagine\nthis dog with its ears back running away from taxis and\njust cowering from the noise. And it's just hustle and\nbustle and people are brutal. And how much you want it for,\nget in the car, you know? Screaming over the intercom\nand just everything, everything sensory changes. And let's get home, okay, let's go. You got a meeting, you\ngotta get to the next place. You gotta give a talk, you gotta sign. Out here, when we finish up\nhere, what are we gonna do? We're gonna eat some food,\nmaybe go catch a crocodile. (Lex laughs) Go walk around the jungle at night. Like it's slower, it makes sense. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And there's that again, there's that deep meaning of that here, where we can be the guardians for good. We can be, we can hold that candle up and know for sure that\nwe're protecting the trees from being destroyed. And it's that simple thing\nof just, this is good. There you go.\n- [Lex] It's simple. - In society, I feel like everyone's always losing their minds and forgetting the most basic of fundamental truths. And out here, you can't\nreally argue with them. You know, when we needed\nwater, it was like shit, if we don't get water, we're fucked. And that's to me, that's where\nthe camaraderie comes from. Because no matter what, we'll be, we could go to the most\nfancy ass restaurant through the biggest, most\nfamous people in the world. Doesn't matter, we still\nremember what it was like standing around in the jungle going, \"Fuck, we're scared and\nwe don't have water.\" We got reduced to the\nsimplest form of humans. And that's something. And we survived, and that's cool. - And you take all the, all those people in their nice dresses in those fancy restaurants\nand you put them in those conditions, they're all gonna want the\nsame thing, just water and. - Yes.\n- [Lex] It's all the same thing.\n- All the beautiful people. - How has your view of\nyour own mortality evolved over your interaction with the jungle? How often do you think about your death? - Well, I don't anymore 'cause the, I've come to believe that\nthere is a benevolent god, spirit, creator taking care of us. And I don't think about my own death. We have a little bit of time here and we clearly know nothing\nabout what we're doing here. And it seems like we just\nhave to do the best we can. And so I just, it doesn't scare me. I've come close to dying a lot of times and I just don't think I, you don't wanna have a\nbad death, first of all. You don't wanna be a statistic. You don't wanna find out. You don't wanna like try out a, be the first to try out\na new product and oops, it crushed you. You know, that's a terrible way to go. Or the people that used to, you know, in the Gold Rush they were using mercury and they were all getting, or\nlead, it was lead poisoning. And it's like, oh, you know, a few million people died that way. And it's like, you wanna, you\nwant a good death, you know? You wanna, staring down\nthe eyes of a tiger or hanging off the edge of a cliff, saving somebody's life, something, something worthy, warrior's death. - Mm-hmm, riding a 16-foot\nblack caiman, just. - Boots on, screaming. Yeah, that would be fun,\nthat'd be a good one. - A lot of people say that you carry the spirit of Steve Irwin in your heart, in the way you\ncarry yourself in this world. I mean, he, that guy was full of joy. - If I have a percentage of\nSteve Irwin, I would be honored. But that guy, I think\nthere's only one Steve. I think that he was, he occupied his own strata\nof just shining light. Everything was positive, enthusiasm, love and happiness, and save the animals and do better and let's make it fun. And that was so infectious\nthat it sort of transcended his TV show. It transcended his conservation work. It transcended business\nand entrepreneurship. It just, through sheer\nmagnetism and enthusiasm, he just, I mean, everyone\nknew who Steve was. Everyone loved Steve. We still all love Steve. And so it's just amazing\nwhat one spirit can do. So if anybody, you know,\nmakes that comparison, I get really uncomfortable because to me, Steve Irwin is like just the GOAT. And so I'm okay with that. - Well, I at least agree\nwith that comparison. Having spent time with you, there's just an eternal flame of joy and adventure too, just pulling you. A dark question, but do\nyou think you might meet the same end, giving your life in some\nway to something you love? - That is a dark question, but I think most likely\nI'll get whacked by loggers. I think that loggers or gold\nminers will take me out. I don't picture myself\ngoing from animals, but. - That would be heartbreaking too. - Yeah, it would but yeah,\nat the same time though, like the Kurt Cobain value of that, if I died doing what I\nlove, to protect the river, that'd be so worth so much more. A lot, like we'd get the 30\nmillion if I died tomorrow, for sure. So we've already talked\nabout this with my friends. I'm like, if I get whacked.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Do the foundation, make the documentary, protect the river, protect the heartbeats. Call it \"The Heartbeats\", \"Junglekeepers: the Heartbeats\", you know? Be ready for it because\nthese things do happen. People get pissed if you get in their way and as many happy people as\nand whose lives we're changing, there's also gonna be some\njealous, shitty, upset people who are mad that they\ncan't make prostitutes out of young girls and\nkeep destroying the planet. And so they might just erase you. Me. - Well, I hope you, like a Clint Eastwood character,\njust impossible to kill. - I hope so. - I like how you squinted your eyes. (Paul and Lex laugh) On cue. Who do you think will play you in a movie? - God, somebody with the right nose. - Yeah. - Somebody who can live\nup to this (indistinct). - Yeah, all right, Italian.\n- [Paul] Yeah. - It's funny. Do you think of yourself as\nItalian or human, American? - That's the thing I don't, you know, my life has been the\nUnited Nations of whatever. Like I just, every, to\nme, I just, I don't, that's the other thing. You go back to society and\neveryone's obsessed with race. To me, I'm like, look,\nleopards have black babies and yellow babies, one mother,\nlike, they're all leopards. And I'm so colorblind and race\nblind and everything else. I've lived in India. My friends are Peruvian. My family, we got Italian,\nFilipino, just everything. And so I've, I'm so immersed in it that when I find it very\njarring and disconcerting how much time we spend talking\nabout different religions and just the differences in humans. I'm like, dude, we're\ntalking about whether or not our ecosystems are gonna\nbe able to provide for us. We're talking about nuclear, what we're talking about\nthis some pretty serious shit on the table. And we're over here arguing\nover like shades of gray of, it's so trivial.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And that shit drives me crazy. And as does the outrage\nwhere it's like, no, you have to care. I've been criticized for not\ncaring enough about that. And I'm like, I'm gonna, who cares what the hell I am? Who gives a shit, what the hell? I'm a human, we're all human.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It's not that easy, but\nit's kind of fun sometimes. And we're at a better time and hit like when you think\nabout like the Middle Ages, like even if you were a king, you still didn't have it that good. You didn't have pineapples in the winter. You didn't even know what\nthe fuck a pineapple was. We have pineapples whenever we want them. We can fly on planes to other countries. - By the way, let's clarify. We, you mean a large\nfraction of the world. You know, I mentioned to you\none of the biggest things I've noticed when I immigrated\nfrom the Soviet Union to the United States is the how plentiful bananas and pineapples were. - [Paul] Yeah.\n- The fruit section, the produce section of the, didn't have to wait in\nline at the grocery store, could just eat as many\nbananas and pineapples and cherries and watermelon as you want. That's, not everybody has that. - No, that's true, not\neverybody has that, but. - But everybody could be\nthat king now, pineapple. - But a growing number of people today. - Can feast on pineapple. - Can feast on pineapple and have toasters and new, distracting apps\nall the way until the grave. - That's the thing that I also noticed is I don't think so much about\npolitics when I'm here, or. - We haven't even talked about it. - We haven't, don't talk about the stupid differences between humans. - [Paul] Nah.\n- Except to just kind of laugh at the absurdity of it on occasion. - I've been too busy\ntrying to survive glaciers and jungles and avalanches\nand all kinds of shit. - Do you think nature is brutal as Warner Herzog showed it? Or is it beautiful? - I think the brutality\nof nature is the chaos. And I think that we\nare the only ones in it that are capable of organizing in the direction of order and light. So yes, there are gonna be\nhyenas tearing each other apart. Yes, there's gonna be war-torn nations and poor, starving children, but we as humans have the power to work towards something\nmore organized than that. - So there is a force within nature that's always searching\nfor order, for good. - It's kind of a unifying\ntheory if you think about it. I mean, all of the chaos of history and the wars and the chaos of nature, we, through technology and organization, there's so many people, more people today than ever before I think who are so concerned, who realize that the incredible power, like what Jane Goodall\nsays about, you know, how you can affect the people around you, how you can do good in the world, how you can change the\nnarrative of conservation from one of loss and darkness to one of innovation and light. Like, we can do incredible things. We are the masters as humans. And I think that we're at, on the cusp of sort of understanding the true potential of that. Like I just think that\nmore than ever, people, people have harnessed this\nability to do good in the world and be proud of it and just change the darkness into something else. - When you have lived here and taken in the ways\nof the Amazon jungle, how have your views of God, you mentioned, how have your views of God changed? Who is God? - I've come to believe that, again, back to that Christ wasn't a Christian, Muhammad wasn't a Muslim,\nand Buddha wasn't a Buddhist. That like the game, the game is love and compassion and the universe is chaotic and dangerous and nature is chaotic and dangerous. But we, if this is some sort\nof a biological video game, that our reality, that the test is can we be good? And we go through it every day. Can you be good to your parent? Can you be good to your partner? Can you be good to your coworkers? Can, it's so difficult. And we see how people can cheat and steal and hurt and destroy and the incredible impact\nthat it has on the world, the returning, exponential impact that one act of kindness,\none act of good can do. And so I see nature as God. I see the religions as different\ncultural manifestations of the same truth, the same creative force. Maybe me and you have the same beliefs and your aliens are my angels. - Well, thank you for being one of the humans trying\nto do good in this world. And thank you for bringing\nme along for some adventure and I believe more adventure awaits. - Thank you for being\nenough of a psychopath to actually just sign on to\ncome into the Amazon rainforest in a suit. And a year ago when you told\nme that you were gonna do this, I truly didn't believe you. So for being a man of your word and for the incredible work\nyou do to connect humans and to create dialogue and\nto do good in the world and for all the adventures that we've had, thank you so much. - Thank you, brother. - Lex, thanks man. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Paul Rosolie. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Joseph Campbell. The big question is whether\nyou are going to be able to say a hearty yes to your adventure. Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
