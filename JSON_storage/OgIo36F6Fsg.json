So that one, I'm really happy with. I just think it's a really funny concept, and also I executed the build well. - [Lex] So it's an arm? - [Simone] Hm-mm. - [Lex] What's the build? - [Simone] I built it\noff of an old lamp arm. Yeah, basically, it's\njust a motorized arm, and this kind of torso of a person. - [Lex] Was this, so it's\nactually a hand, right? - [Simone] It's just laser cut plywood, and it kinda has like, it looks creepy. - [Lex] Yeah. - And yeah, it's says \"Proud of you, son.\" Because I just thought\nthat sounded more funny than \"Proud of you, daughter,\" and also, \"Proud of you, son,\" just, it immediately communicates\nthat it's a parent. It's not just like a\ncolleague or something. He's like, \"Proud of you.\" - (laughs) Yeah. - [Simone] And it charges\nyou a quarter for it. - Yeah, but you add like\nChatGPT on top of that, and fine tune it on\nconversations you've had with your parents, and all of a sudden, you have a thing that can fundamentally transform your psyche. - [Simone] Yeah. - The following is a conversation with Simone Giertz, and an\ninventor, designer, engineer, and roboticist famous for\na combination of humor and brilliant creative\ndesign in the systems and products she creates, including, as part of her new product\ndesign company called Yetch, she has a popular YouTube channel, where she has demonstrated\na lot of her incredible and fun designs and inventions\nfrom quote, \"shitty robots,\" to a Tesla Model 3 converted into a truck, but where she also revealed\nher personal journey, after having been diagnosed\nwith a brain tumor. Simone is a brilliant, fun,\nand inspiring human being. It was truly an honor for\nme to get to meet her, and to have this chat. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Simone Giertz."

      "section": "Early creations",
      "text": "What was the first cool thing you built, where you fell in love with\nthe process of making stuff? - You know, I think, in the\nbeginning of building stuff, you run into the limitations\nof your skills so much. So I feel like honestly, building gets less and less frustrating, or I love it more and\nmore, the more I know. - So all the limitations aren't fun? Like when it's-\n- The limitations are fun, but it's like when you\nhave an idea of something and you wanna make it a certain level, and then you just have to compromise with the materials and the\ntools and the skills you have. So I can't remember first\ntime where I felt like- - [Lex] I'm proud of this. - Wow, this was so smooth,\nI'm so proud of it. I feel like a lot of people,\nI watch them build stuff, and it's just like\nwatching water pour down, it's just so easy, and for me, it's just like trying to\nshove a toy car into a wall. - So you're not able\nto step back and marvel at the early creations, even like, we're not even talking the\nArduino stuff, even before then. - I'm from Sweden, and you\nhave to choose either sewing or woodworking, and I chose\nwoodworking in middle school, and I remember the sense\nof pride when I got to bring something home\nand that thing of like, oh my God, I get to show my parents this. And I think that is kind of\nthe feeling that I've built my job around. It's the sense of pride, and wanting to show people\nsomething that I made, and back then, it was a\nlittle wooden spoon, and now, it's a slightly larger wooden spoon. - Wood spoon. Yeah. That is dynamic, and moves,\nand has a mind of its own. You first started doing\nmore engineering type-stuff with Arduino boards at Punch Through Design, which\nis an SF engineering firm. What are, just from your memory there, what are some cool things you built there? - So the thing is, I went\nto advertising school, and I just, like a\nvocational study's a year, and I realized there\nthat I didn't care much for advertising, but I\nthought it was really fun to build stuff and program, so I just completely focused on that, and there I built my\nfirst hardware project or electronics project,\nwhich was this iPhone case with retractable guitar strings. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - So basically, I imagined\nthat you could pull out guitar strings from\nthe bottom of your iPhone, and you could pluck it to your belt, and then you could hold\na chord on the screen. And I built that together\nwith my friend Jonathan. And I was like, oh, this is dope. I thought it was so much\nfun, and I considered, oh, should I go to school for this? But then I thought, hmm,\nmaybe I can get a job, and I could get paid to\nlearn about electronics. So, just based off of that one project, I got the job at Punch Through\nDesign, where actually, it was a one-year internship. - Can you explain what\nwe're talking about here? So it's a case. - [Simone] Hm-mm. - With guitar strings attached to it. - [Simone] Yeah. - Does it actually work at all? - It does. - These are not on the\nscreen guitar strings? - No, so they're actual\nstrings that you pull out. So there's a mechanism that's almost like a seatbelt mechanism\nand, yeah, you pull them out from the bottom of your phone, and you can attach them to your belt. I mean, it's terrible. There's a few different ways to decide if somebody's touching a guitar string. And what you do in a real\nguitar is, you have the little, it's like measuring the\nvibration or the change in the, yeah, you're measuring how\nthe guitar is vibrating, and you can't really do that, because I can't have a receiving sensor, because the guitar strings are gonna move in relationship to that\nbecause you don't have this rigid neck. And this is, yeah, this was\nmy first electronics project. I was a little fledging baby maker, but what I decided was\nto use capacitive touch, 'cause that is independent\non if the guitar strings are moving in relationship to something, or in relation to something. So basically, there was just this little Bluetooth Arduino board that this company, Punched Through Design made,\nso that was how I found them. And I measured the capacitive touch. So like whenever the\nguitar string was measured, there was this little\nmicrocontroller that was like, oh my god, a guitar string\ngot measured, or it touched, and then that sent a signal\nover Bluetooth to my phone, and I'd built a little\niPhone app that interpreted those Bluetooth signals,\nand then checked what type of chord I was holding on the screen, and then played the coherent sound. - So you holding the chords on the screen. - So you're doing the\nmulti-touch sensing there. - [Simone] Hm-mm. - That's incredible. - I honestly cannot believe\nthat I pulled it off, because I think I was,\nignorance was definitely bliss, because that was like, yeah, the first hardware project I'd ever built, the first iPhone app I'd ever programmed. And now, if somebody was like, \"Hey, I want this to be my first project,\" I would probably be\nlike, \"Oh, that's a lot,\" but I pulled it off. - That's such an interesting\nthing for people to hear, because it's your first project, and a lot of people stop\nbecause of the difficulty of their first project. They never truly discover\ntheir own genius, because they stop at the\nfirst, and you didn't stop. So it'd be interesting\nto kind of psychoanalyze you on the couch, of why you didn't stop. 'Cause you have to build an app. - [Simone] Yeah. - To figure out how to, did you know how to program much, or no? - [Simone] No. - Okay.\n- I mean a little bit, but I never programmed\nin or done any iOS apps. - Okay, so you have to\nfigure out how to get, forget what the app does, just get the app running and\nworking and then you have to figure out how to get\nthe sensors in real time, the finger touching,\nand you have to connect how to get the capacitor touch working with the microcontrollers. Do you know anything about\nthe capacitor touch sensors at that time? - No, I mean, it's pretty easy now. It's basically-\n- Everything's easy. You know, rockets are pretty easy. - Hey, you sound like my grandma. She's like, I have an Italian grandma, and I'm always trying to get her, we're trying to get\nher to tell her recipes and every recipe starts\nwith, \"It's very simple.\" And then there's 45 minutes of\nher explaining it. (laughing) - It's like with gymnastics\nat the Olympics, they make it look easy. The best people in the world always make the impossible seem easy. - I pride myself with making\nbuildings look really hard, 'cause I feel like I'm\nalways struggling so much. - [Lex] You make the easy seem impossible. - Yeah, yes. - [Lex] No. So how many strings was it? Was it just one? - Oh gosh, I mean this\nis such a long time ago. No, it was six. - Six strings, and you could\ntouch it, and then there's, wow, and it can, and then the\nphone itself makes a sound? - Uh-huh, and I still think\nit's such a cool concept to have this mobile, I'm\nnot even a guitar player. I don't know, I mean I got\nthe idea because I was kind of strumming on my\ncharge cord of my phone. - Oh, like an air guitar, but on a cord? - Yeah, but I've been thinking\nabout it 'cause I'm like, oh man, it would be really fun to go back to that project with what I know now, but the problem with it is\nthat when you're producing the tension in your\nstring just with your arm, you can't make it taut\nenough to actually play. It kinda becomes playing\nthese saggy strings. - [Lex] Yep. - So as you're not really\ngetting that experience. And I think that's why, I mean I, yeah. I haven't really pursued it. I wonder if there's a way\nto generate the tightness from the case itself, get a\ndevice that unfolds, and then, with some kind of tightening mechanisms. - Yeah, but then it kind of\nbecomes this whole thing- - [Lex] A guitar. - A guitar, then it just\nbecomes a really shitty guitar. - [Lex] Yeah. - Which, this is a really shitty guitar, but it's also not a guitar. - But it's so shitty, It's awesome. - Yeah, I don't know.\n- But it's cool that you have an interface between a device that's capable of incredible computational power, and an actual hardware thing. Is there something that\nyou can psychoanalyze that made you finish, that others could hear in\ntheir own struggle to do their first project like that? Because you were a non-engineering\nperson, technically, and you did a pretty cool\nrenegade, out-there, wild, no-instructions engineering project. - No, it definitely was an off-road build, where it's like if you're\nbuilding a Lego kit, it's very much on the road, and you're following\ninstructions and this is like, you have no idea if\nyou're headed for a cliff or a dead end, or you're gonna get stuck. I think it had a natural pressure to it, because it was a school project. - [Lex] Yeah. - So, it did have deadlines built into it, and stuff like that, so\nthat definitely helped. But I think also, it was just so incredibly\nmotivating when I realized that I might be able to pull it off. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like that was, I felt like a bloodhound, you're just like, \"Oh my God, I can actually make this happen.\" And I think if I hadn't\nseen that at the horizon, it would've been harder to stick through. - Were you able to see\nthe end of the tunnel pretty early on? - No, not really. (laughs) - So there's something to\njust suffering for a while. - I don't know how your\nbrain works, but it's like, if I have a problem, I can't\nstop thinking about it. It's so fun to think about it. I spent two and a half years\ndesigning a coat hanger, and I just can't stop thinking about it. I get so into it, 'cause\nI think it's so much fun. - Take me to this two-year\njourney of the coat hanger. - (laughing) The coat hanger. - [Lex] How did it begin? - How did it begin? It began with a corner in\nmy home where I couldn't fit a coat rack. The thing is, I shouldn't\nhave brought this up, because I'm gonna release it as a product, probably in a year. - Oh, an actual product.\n- Mm-hm. - Okay, well let's view it as a mystery. - [Simone] It's a mystery, yeah. - It's what it is, it solves a fundamental\nproblem in the human condition. - Yes, and I am so excited\nabout it, and I cannot, I don't think, yeah, but this\nis, I get so pumped about it, because I see, it's just this issue, or this problem that I wanna solve, and I can't put it to rest until I have. - Speaking of coat hangers, doorknobs have always\nbeen interesting to me. Is cool how there's\nthings that everybody uses that somebody designed. - [Simone] Lex. - Yeah? - Oh my God, so, okay, so\nthis is, so I have two big, so basically, I started on\nYouTube, and I have been doing that for the last\nseven or eight years. And I've been thinking of,\nokay, what's next for me? 'Cause I wanna keep on\ntrying out new things. And I'm kind of going into\ntwo different avenues. One is the product\nbusiness that I started, coat hanger is TBD, and then I am working on a pilot episode of a show, where each episode is\nabout an everyday object, and why they look the way that they do. So we've written a pilot\nepisode about forks, and it's all about, why do\nthey look the way that they do? - [Lex] That's awesome. - Why did this became the\neating implement of the West? Why are we ruled by an iron\nfork? How did that happen? And everyday object that you have, and that you just take for granted, somebody's just made it up. - Yeah, we're all sheep.\nWe all keep using it. - [Simone] Yeah. - Even if it's not, I mean, presumably most objects\nare optimal, you hope, or at least-\n- But they're not, yeah. And that's what I think is\nso like the world around us, and this is why I love building things, is because it just opens up this idea that the world around us is so malleable, and you can make objects\nwork for you better. I spent, I made this fruit\nbowl, I had a fruit bowl, and I was always annoyed\nthat I had either too little or too much fruit for it. So I made a fruit bowl where\nI can change the diameter of it, has a mechanism so you\ncan make it bigger or smaller. And that's just the thing\nof being like bowls. Why are they the way that they are? I can make them different. And I think like I wanna make\nan episode about doorknobs. I think it's so interesting,\nwhy are they the way they are? Why are they placed\nthe way where they are? - I think that's gonna be a rabbit hole from which you'll never return. - I would happily live in\nthat rabbit hole forever. Like if I can like dig out a\nlittle niche for myself there, because I think it's like... They go so deep. - They're also on\ndifferent sides of doors. You never, like the push/pull\nsituation on doors in general? That's one of the main\nproblems of humanity is figuring out-\n- Push/pull doors? (laughs) - [Lex] Figuring out which- - Is embarrassing, yeah. - Okay, how many, there's\n8 billion people on Earth. Every single second, there\nis millions of people being embarrassed by the confusion... - Real life stats. - Right now there's somebody, some guy, first time in college, he's trying to be impressive\nto everybody, he pushes on it, and he plays it off like it's\ncool, oh, shit, I knew that, over and over. - And it affects our behaviors. That was why I think it's\nso interesting with forks, is that forks actually\naffect our eating behaviors, and they can get you to\neat faster or slower, take bigger bites or smaller bites. And they're all these\nways, or like the social, I mean the reason that chopsticks work is because they do the food\nchopping in the kitchen, rather than on the plate. And also you have a bowl\nthat you bring to your mouth, whereas a plate you keep on the, there are just all these ways in which these objects\naffect our behavior, opening and closing doors. And I think it's such an\ninteresting take on culture, and human behavior, through these objects that we use every day, and we\nnever question them really. - Yeah, and then there's\ninstitutions that are controlling our mind that don't\nwant us to know the truth. Why are sporks not more popular? Have you asked yourself that question? - Yeah, no, it's all Big\nUtensil is behind all of it. (both laughing) - All right, so, in those early days, did you suffer from imposter syndrome? That leap to being an engineer? Was there, especially when\nyou started working on parts of the design on a team of\nengineers, was there insecurity? - Both yes and no. I think I always try to\nflip my flaws into selling points and for that, so\ngetting that job, I was like, oh, you're a team of engineers. Everybody working here is an engineer. Your customers are not all engineers. You need somebody who can\nbe your filter and tell you when something's gonna be too hard for your customers to understand. So it was more me being like, oh no, it might seem that me not\nhaving skills is a bad thing, but actually, it's a\ngreat thing, you need it. - I represent the everyday person. I understand deeply what\neverybody needs and wants. - Yes, that is me, the\nrepresentation of the average human. But I mean, I remember that, so I studied physics for\na year in college and then I dropped out, and I had\nthis rule for myself, that whenever I did not\nunderstand something, I would ask a question. So I was always raising my hand in class, and it's this room, entire auditorium, filled with incredibly intelligent people who are mortified of seeming stupid. And I think that was really, and I remember people at the\nend of the year coming up to me and being like, \"Thank you so much for all\nthe questions you asked, because whenever there was\nsomething that I was too scared to ask, you\nalways raised your hand.\" So I think it is a bit of a skill, and I think that is kind of how I channel my imposter syndrome is, I'm just like, no, let's lay it all out there. (laughs) - So you're okay being\nalmost self-deprecating, just coming off, I mean,\nI'm definitely that, I kind of lean into it,\nI call myself an idiot. I lean into being stupid. I\nthink not all heroes wear capes. And the guy and girl who\nasks the stupid question is everybody's hero. Including the poor teachers. - Yeah, I think it's both.\nIt's a double-edged sword. I started out on the internet,\nI kind of got the moniker, the Queen of Shitty Robots\nbecause I posted a lot of stuff on /r/shittyrobots\non Reddit, and people"

      "section": "Sh*tty Robots",
      "text": "started calling me the\nQueen of /r/shittyrobots, and then, the /r kind of dropped. So what I'm trying to say is, I did not come up with that myself, but I did happily adopt it. So I definitely came from\na place of like building things that didn't\nwork, and kind of, yeah, everything going wrong every time. Like happily failing. And\nI think that was amazing. It was a really powerful\ntool for me to not get my perfectionism in the way, because if I set out to\ndo something that's great, then I'm never gonna start. And I was like, no, I just need\nsomething that looks funny. But what I've realized\nnow is that it was also a defense mechanism. Being self-deprecating\nis always beating people to the punch. It kind of was a survival\ntactic on the internet, of being never daring\nto set out as an expert. And I still do that, I'm terrified to tell\npeople how to do something, even if I know, because it opens\nyou up for being shot down, so I think I definitely have a conflicted relationship with it. And now especially, as I'm getting older, I am more skilled than I was before, I mean I'm a CEO of three\nbusinesses, and I'm like, I don't need to keep on talking\nmyself down all the time. So yeah, I think it's\ndefinitely something that has served me really, really well, and that is still a thing\nthat I have in my work life and in my relationships, but I'm also trying to only\ndo it when it's beneficial to me and not when it's harmful. - Yeah, but when you're\nas successful as you are, I feel like people like it when you're self-deprecating and you don't take yourself seriously. You have that humility.\n- Yeah. - I think it's probably the hardest when you're starting out. - Yeah? No, I think it\nwas easier then, almost. I dunno. - But nobody takes you seriously, right? When you're starting\nout, when you're young. - You know, I just realized\nthat I played a lot more stupid than I was. And I think it's also, oh gosh, I can't believe I'm\nthe one bringing this up, but being a woman in a\nmale-dominated field, and you're like, I was\njust trying to make myself the least amount threatening\nor really unthreatening, because people are threatened\nby you in different ways, and it's like, you have such\na thin line that you can walk where you're like, okay, I need to be just attractive\nenough for people to not be offended by my appearance, but just unattractive enough for people to not sexualize me. I have to be just smart\nand witty enough for people to be like, \"Oh my god,\nthat's really cool.\" But also shoot myself down\nenough for other people not to be able to do it or be like, oh yeah, watch this woman try, thinking that she knows\nhow to build electronics. So it's like... - That's an interesting skill to build, especially when you put yourself\nout there on the internet. - [Simone] Yeah. - Unfortunately, that's the\nreality of the internet, and it's a skill you have to develop, and it's actually why a\nlot of really brilliant people avoid the internet. - [Simone] Yeah. - There's not many people,\nlike at MIT for example, there's not many brilliant\nprofessors or PhD students and so on, just putting\ntheir stuff out there, because if they really put their heart and soul into a thing, first of\nall, that's really hard, and nobody sees it, and\nthen everyone's like, \"Eh, this is boring.\" So there's so many failure\nmodes like, \"This is boring.\" Or, like, like you said, you're coming off as\ntoo much of an expert, you're not self-deprecating enough or there's just so many failure modes and it's terrifying for people. But I feel like that's a\nskill you should learn, because most people, like at\nMIT, at university, and so on, are doing a lot of awesome stuff. - [Simone] Yeah. - And they should show it off. But I feel like you figured out a really good\nprocess of showing it off, of when you fail, when\nyou succeed, all of it. Not taking yourself too seriously, but also revealing through the humor and the self-deprecation a kind of genius, a kind of intelligence and curiosity. - Okay, I just wanna snapshot that quote, and put it on my LinkedIn,\nand the back of my book. - [Lex] When is your\nautobiography coming out? - Oh, never. (laughs) - You don't wanna say that,\nbecause a year from now. - Oh God, I don't wanna\nshit on autobiographies. - Yeah.\n- No. But even, just by saying that, I'm on shitting on autobiographies. I just, me being interested\nenough in somebody to wanna read 600 pages about them talking about themselves, it's a... - No, well, (laughing) that's\nexactly the kind of person that should write one. - But also I'm fucking 32 years old, what do I have to write about? I went through puberty,\nI lost my virginity, and here we are, I dunno,\nit's such a... (laughs) - Three chapters, it's a\ncoloring book (laughing). - Chapter seven, I learn\nto tie my own shoelaces. - I feel like it would be\nawesome. Anyway, what's the Queen? So how did you achieve\nthe status of royalty? The Queen of Shitty Robots?\nWhat's the origin story there? - I have officially\nrenounced my title now. - Can you still speak\nof the time when you- - I can still speak of the time. - [Lex] Your kingdom? - Yes. No, I mean it started on because I- - Did you rule by love or fear? - By fear of rejection, from me, that people would reject me. So I, yeah, I started\nmaking these little gifs. The early projects that I\ndid were very gif-forward. It was always like, I only did it because they\ncould be translated into a gif. - Gif-forward. I like it. - Yeah, but honestly it was like, it's a really good mental exercise, to vet if your project is\neasy enough to be explained by a seven-second looping\nvideo without audio, and because nobody's gonna care\nthat it also has Bluetooth. It's really like, is it\nself-explanatory enough to be explained through a gif, so yeah. - Could I just pause, I'm\nsorry to interrupt but- - [Simone] No, go for it. - I feel like all scientific\npapers and projects should go through that exercise. - Can it be explained as a gif? - Yeah, actually, Deepmind\ndoes a good job of this. Like, we saw a protein\nfolding, here's a gif, that's literally what they do. - [Simone] Yeah. - Because who's gonna\nread the Nature paper? So, you have to like, how do\nwe communicate this visually, in a sexy, clean way, where people can intuitively understand, even if you don't know what a protein is, even if you don't know what\nprotein folding is, yeah. It's a cool exercise. - No, it's very like, yeah, if somebody comes outta context, and that's been really interesting, also, building this product\nbusiness and trying to do the marketing around that. And I'm like, if somebody comes in, and they have no idea\nabout what this product is, will they get it explained\nto them in this ad? And I don't know, but it's definitely a\nworthwhile exercise to do. So I started making\nthese projects that got translated into gifs, and I posted them on /r/shittyrobots on Reddit. - So that subReddit existed? - Yeah, and I loved it. I thought it was really\nfun and I was like, I wanna contribute with content here. - [Lex] Conquer it. - I don't, I mean, I don't know. I was voted, I think I was\nvoted top user of 2015. So yeah, that's an old merit. - Once you win a Nobel\nPrize, you always have the Nobel Prize.\n- (laughing) Yeah. - Okay, so what was the first, do you remember the early\ngifs that you created? - So this is when I was at Punch Through Design in\nSan Francisco, I was building a lot of hardware projects for them. But I also felt, and they\nwere so supportive of me, but I also, it's such a different way, representing a brand versus\nrepresenting yourself. So there were some projects\nthat I just ruled out, 'cause I was like, this feels\ntoo weird for this brand. And I started building them on the side. One of them was a\ntoothbrush helmet, and yeah, so it's like a skateboard\nhelmet with a robot arm on the forehead, kind\nof like a unicorn horn, and it brushes your teeth for you. - Was that the first\nYouTube video you uploaded? - It was the first gif that I uploaded. So actually, I wanted to... I wanted to do a kids'\nshow about electronics in Sweden, 'cause I was\nlike, I love electronics, I think it's fucking dope. I could do a kids' show about it. So I filmed this terrible,\nterrible pilot episode in my bedroom in San Francisco, and that's when I built the toothbrush helmet\nand I emailed it to them, I mean just cold email,\nI had no in or anything, but I was like, \"Hey, I wanna do this,\" and they didn't get back\nto me, nobody surprised, and I was like, well I\nhave this thing I built, I might as well post it on the internet. So that's why I made the little gif, and I posted it on /r/shittyrobots. I think it got like 50,000\nviews, and I was like, wow. And from there, I just\nkept on building things, and I think within six months,\nit was my full-time job. - Can you go through the detailed design of this toothbrush helmet? So it's a motor, it's like\na servo, what's the motor? Is an Arduino involved? - Yeah. So I built it off of\nthis robot arm called MeArm. So it's just this acrylic robot arm, and I think it has three servomotors, and it's all controlled by an\nArduino, all the electronics. - The arm's already prebuilt? - It was a kit, so I assembled it. - How do you make sure the\nlength of the arm is the proper? - I mean the arm came down so it's like, I mean I just programmed it\nto come down to my mouth, and then poorly brush my front teeth. - Yeah. - [Simone] Yeah. - And it was just swung\nback and forth, I mean... - Trial and error, is how I did that. - What was the challenges\nof that, do you remember? - [Simone] Oh gosh. - Or was that one not much of a struggle? - No, it was definitely a struggle. - [Lex] Because also, how do\nyou loop it with a nice gif? - I mean, it loops. It loops fine. - Yeah, it loops pretty\nfine. That's not that hard? - No, I mean it doesn't\nhave to be perfect. It's a gif, it's the internet. Things are shitty all the time. I think the biggest struggle\nof that was that I had this intention for it to be the show, and then them not giving back. And I was like, well,\nif they don't want it, then maybe YouTube will have me. - They don't notice my genius yet. - [Simone] Yep. - What was so bad about\nthe pilot, do you remember? What's the most embarrassing? - It's so cringey. Yeah, I mean it's thankfully\nnot on the internet, so nobody can find it. But it's very much me being\nin what I called host mode, which is where I'm like, \"Okay, so what we're\ngonna learn today is that, we're gonna look at this is\nsomething called a servomotor,\" and the intonation and\neverything is really different. And I'm actually, I mean\nthinking back on that, I'm so happy that they\ndidn't get back to me, because it's such a\ndifferent thing to start your career in your living room, running back and forth\nto the camera and filming something and then looking at it, and I got to really find my\nown voice in a different way. And then a year later,\nthey offered me a show, but then I was so off\nand running, I was like, no, I don't wanna do this. - You didn't fall into that\nplace of being a actor, like a YouTuber, where you're presenting\na kind of personality. You're more focused on the\nproduct you're creating. - I mean, I think it's\na combination of it. I think of it as acting sometimes, but I only play the role of myself. But of course it's like when\nyou're shooting something for the seventh time, like you have to be able\nto muster that enthusiasm. But no, it's not a kind of, think of everyday life me\nas a watered-down version of the YouTube version. It's like-\n- It's a cheap knockoff? - Yeah, (laughing) the wish.com version. No, it's just like, add a few\nparts water, and you have me. But on YouTube, it's just so condensed, 'cause you have jump cuts, and yeah, I'll script jokes and make\nsure that everything lands, and there's music and stuff,\nand then in real life, you don't have any of that. But it's still me. - What are some other cool\nrobots in the early days that stand out to you? I mean there's a million we\ncan go through, but what, maybe, what was a challenging one? Like a really challenging\none, in the early days? - I mean I remember the breakfast robot, which was my second project,\nwas a challenging one, so... - Was it eating cereal? - Yeah, it's a robot that\npours milk and cereal, and feeds me with a spoon. It was mostly challenging\nbecause it was so, everything had to be\nin the right location, and there were so many takes\nbefore I got everything right. And by right, I mean it\nmakes an absolute mess. Yeah, that one was challenging. - [Lex] How many takes was that one? - I don't know, probably 12, 10 something. - [Lex] Just a mess everywhere. - It was a mess, and also, I\nused Cheerios for the cereals, and it's shot in my old bedroom in San Francisco, and\nthe floors were sticky for weeks afterwards. - See, this could go\ninto your autobiography. - [Simone] (laughing) Yeah. - It's nice. - We can just type out this podcast. - [Lex] Make a transcript. - And I'll release it, my\nmanager would be stoked. - We'll fix it in post. Yeah, the feed, 'cause you have a couple\nof feeding ones, right? There's soup, isn't there a soup one? - Yeah, there's a soup robot.\nThere's a beer-pouring robot. - I mean, that's awesome. That's a difficult robotics problem, in the shitty and the perfect version, of having an arm that interacts intimately with a human being. And one of the most\nintimate things you can do with a human being\nthat's PG is to feed it. - That's what I was thinking,\n(laughing) don't go there. - [Lex] Where is he going with this? - Oh my God, he's a YouTube\ncomic come live. Like, dammit. - So, to me there's a, feeding is tricky, or even like getting a beer,\neven pouring a beer, is tough, into a glass.\n- Yeah, it's trickier than anyone\nwho hasn't tried it thinks. And even making it, I think what I realized\nis that making things really shitty, or failing\nin a spectacular way is also its own sort of skill, because, the shittiest robot is the\none that doesn't turn on, but that isn't much to watch. So it was always wanting\nfor it to fail in these kind of spectacular ways. No, there's a lot of stuff to be said about engineering in it."

That was always the confusing thing to me about robotics is that most\nroboticists run away from that. - Yeah.\n- It's weird, 'cause it's obviously gonna be, robots are obviously gonna be everywhere. - Yeah.\n- Obviously. - But it's also humans\nare sensitive and squishy and there's so much liability. - Oh.\n- Yeah. - Yeah. But humans are sensitive and squishy when they interact with\neach other and they hurt each other all the time.

'Cause you spent on a few of them, you spent quite a long time. - [Simone] Mm-hm. - Which is also inspiring\nwhen you take so long on a project. - Yeah, I think kind\nof in the more like fun whimsical department\nrather than shitty robots. I built recently this music box. So like a small music box\nthat kind of has a barrel with little spikes and it plays a song. But I did a large version\nof that that pops a sheet of bubble wrap and then like\nplays tones into a pan flute. So yeah, you can actually program it to play different songs. That one kicked my butt\nin so many creative ways and it was such a pain. I think that is probably\nthe like weird funny project that's taken\nme the longest and like the biggest engineering effort. - [Lex] Where's the sound coming from? - So if you, it all came from me realizing\nthat if you pop bubble wrap and you pop it right\nin front of the opening of a pan flute or like one\nof the pipes you can have it play different tones. So that's what it does. So I built this music\ninstrument off of that. - Okay. If it's okay, can you\ndescribe some something like how it works, some of the\ntechnical details here? - Yeah.\n- It's fascinating. - So basically, I mean one\nof the big issues that I had, so I worked with as of\na year and a half back, I hired an engineer, Stu, So we were collaborating on it. But a big issue that we had\nwas feeding in the bubble wrap sheet and like\nmaking sure that it feeds in straight and doesn't\nget skewed because you need to make like the popping feet, which is where you\nprogram this barrel to pop different bubbles need to\nbe so perfectly aligned on the bubble of the\nbubble wrap for it to pop in the right location. - So there's a feeder for the bubble wrap. That's a challenge. And then you have to have\na barrel with the little baby feet on it.\n- Yeah. - That pops the bubble\nwrap. Why is it so exciting? - That barrel was a pain. - Yeah.\n- As well. I had to get a, like this rotary set\nup for my CNC and yeah, it was a lot of work, but that was really\nfun and it's just like, this is probably my\nfavorite privilege of my job is that I can go down any rabbit hole I think find interesting. - Did you have a lot of\njoy from popping the... - Yeah. That's-\n- The bubbles. - That's a lot of self soothing,\nand like I got to spend, I think I spent a week trying to figure out the best material\nto pop bubble wrap with, because if you have two, if you kind of put them\ntwo through or through, if you put a sheet of bubble\nwrap through two rigid tubes, the air kind of just escapes from one side of the bubble into the other. So what I realized was that if\nyou have a squishy material, like kind of a yoga mat\nmaterial in between it, it actually, it prevents that and pops\nit a lot more reliably. But like increasing the\npop reliability was a huge effort as well. - You have to pop a squishy thing with another squishy thing. - Because you don't need a lot of force. - Yeah.\n- Like you just need it to not, air to not be\nable to escape anywhere. - Wow.\n- But then also we had, there was different\nqualities of bubble wrap where there was a lot of transference between different bubbles. So instead of the bubble popping, it would just seep the air\ninto a neighboring bubble and that like membrane\nwould kind of, so, you know, I just, like getting\nto spend weeks on weeks of just studying bubble wrap. - Did you ever think about\nlike publishing academic work on bubble wrap? - No.\n- Wouldn't that be epic? 'Cause nobody's done this. I bet you nobody's done squishing, Squishy versus squishy for popping. - I bet somebody has. But you know, I always, I thought I was gonna go into academia. Like I was such an ambitious\nstudent. I loved school. I actually applied to\nMIT but then I pulled out 'cause I was like,\nno, I don't wanna do it. But now I realize it's\nreally good that I didn't because I'm too much of a spaz. - Too much of a spaz? Now I'm distracted. I'm thinking, there must be\npapers about when you have two bubbles, yeah. You need to know the\nphysics of two bubble, when you have two bubbles colliding, one will pop first and there\nhas to be good models of that. But that has to do with chemistry and whatever the material\nthe bubble was made from. But then, no, there's materials in here. Somebody must understand\nbubble wrap deeply. Like deeply. - So I'm just gonna take\na quick restroom break because Lex is on his own train now. And I'm just gonna leave\nyou to talk about bubble. Yeah. Actually don't need to go\nto the restroom. (laughs) - I'm gonna insert like a\ntwo hour instructional here with like a blackboard where I... - It's the skill of a podcaster. I feel like I could throw you any topic and you could just go on about it. - I don't know if I have\nthat skill. I just... I love bubble wrap. (laughs) Okay. - Bubble on bubble interaction.

I think first of all,\nyou shouldn't listen to me. - That should be the name\nof your autobiography. - First of all, you\nshouldn't listen to me. I, you know, I realized that I was there for the wrong reasons. I had this deep, I got completely, like starting to get grades in school, which in Sweden at that\ntime we started getting it at 8th grade, so when I was 14, it just kind of hijacked my brain because I realized\nthat I could put a number on how smart I was and\nI got obsessed with it. And I wanted to study\nmechanical engineering because I was like, I like machines. But then physics was\nkind of the hardest thing you could do when I had\nthis like deep need to prove to myself that I was smart. So I started studying physics, realized I wasn't that smart. I realized, or I mean\njust mostly that I like, I love math but I don't\nlove math 10 hours a day. - [Lex] Yeah. - And also I think I am a\ngeneralist through and through. Like I'm decent at a\nfair amount of things, but definitely not a\nspecialist in any ways. And this, it was such a\nspecialist type of area that I felt like the other\nparts of my brain kind of just dwindled and died. So I think most of all, if people are thinking\nabout going to college and especially if you're here in the States and it's so\nfucking expensive, really... Okay, there's two things I wanna do. One is like actually go to\na workplace where people are doing the job that\nyou think you wanna do. If you wanna become a doctor, like be at a hospital and\nlike try to see how doctors work and if you actually like it, because I feel like\npeople have a lot of ideas of what it's gonna be\nlike and it just doesn't match with reality. And then I think when people\nfigure out what they wanna do, there's kind of, that's\ntwo separate questions or there's two questions that\nyou could split out of that. One is like what do you actually wanna do? That for me for the last\n10 years is building stuff. But then there's a second\npart to that question, which is what context\ndo you wanna do that? Do you wanna build stuff at a startup or at a big corporation? Do you wanna build\nstuff for an art gallery or for the movies or for YouTube? And I think that's often\nlike people only learn how to answer the first question, but then it's like the\ncontext means as much. Because I was building stuff at Punch Through Design\nand I wasn't getting that like deep fulfillment. Like I felt like I\nwasn't fully using myself and like hitting all of my gears because I just wasn't that\nmotivated about building stuff for other people. And I changed the context\nand everything changed. - And so sometimes you do\nneed to consider resume and stuff like that,\ndepending on the, but some, I think people consider that way too much, especially in modern times. I feel like you don't\nneed to go to college just for the resume. I feel like the biggest\nbenefit of college, I mean there's a bunch, but\none is just to do hard things. But you could do hard things anywhere. But some people need to be, I was probably one of those people, to be forced to do hard things. And the other is to\nmeet fascinating humans from all walks of life that are pursuing, that have all kinds of\ndifferent passions and allows you to learn, depending on the major, you can learn generally\nand you can search, if you're doing it efficiently, about what actually inspires you. And the other thing is the resume thing. - [Simone] Yeah. - But ultimately you\ndon't need college to find your passion to run with it. - I mean I have so much\ncollege FOMO though. Like I think it's, I chose a different set of experiences and when I applied to MIT I was, I think I was 24, 'cause I was like, oh, maybe I should become\nan electrical engineer because I really liked electronics. But then I remember seeing\nthat the average age was 18 and I was like, oh fuck\nno, I can't hang out, or like be in a room\nfilled with 18 year olds who are smarter than me.\n- Yeah. - So I think I definitely\nlike missed the train on having that experience. But at the same time I\ndid so many other things and I chose other experiences\nand I wouldn't trade them. But I still like, I mean I'll go to on a campus\nand I'll be like, oh... - [Lex] Yeah. - But I think it's also\nbecause I have a dreamy idea of what it is because I never had to do it and practice fully. - Exactly. It's the FOMO. - Yeah.\n- Huh. Yeah. A lot of people really\nstruggle with that burden. They'll go, it doesn't matter\nhow long you go through, if you don't go all the way to the PhD, a lot of people have the FOMO. It doesn't, it's a silly, silly, silly little notion I think\n'cause I think you should be doing college or school\nuntil you find something that lights your heart aflame,\nwhere you're like, fuck yes, I wanna do this. - Yeah.\n- And run with it. - I mean you can find that\nin other contexts as well. I've I found it.\n- Yeah. Exactly. - Yeah. But it is a buffet of\nexperiences that you can have."

So like tambour, like\nyou'll have on like old record player, like it's\nthese like thin slats of wood with fabric on\nthe back and you can kind of get them to go around curves. So basically one of the\ntabletops or table surfaces is tambour and then there's a little crank and you can kind of\nroll it off to the side and it reveals another\ntabletop under it that you can then lift up 'cause it's on cams, so you can switch between the two.

It's like, it's a decision\nthat I made really early on where I was like, I think often people misinterpret what I'm doing as being for children, which I think is part\nbecause like my projects were always really cool, colorful and fun. But I think it also has some sprinkles of sexism of being like, oh,\nit's a woman doing something, she must be doing it for the children. And I'm like, oh, fuck the children. I'm doing it for myself.\n- Yes. Good. - So I think I was just really\nearly on decided of like, oh no, I'm not gonna try to cater to that. Which like still, I mean\nI get a lot of messages from parents being like, can you please stop\ncussing in your videos? And I'm also like, I get it, but also that is not what's\ngonna mess up your kids. - Yeah.\n- Like I really try to be- - Yeah.\n- Thoughtful and a decent enough role model, but I'll also acknowledge\nthat humans fuck. - Yeah.\n- It's okay. - Somehow that you being\nable to say the F you to the system.\n- What word? Word? - F.\n- What do... - I can't. I'm scared.\n(Simone laughing) It sounds better when you\nsay F you, it's a dance. I should, oh boy. Have you ever made a robot\nthat dances with you? - No.\n- Okay. - You need a dance partner. (laughs) - [Lex] I get lonely sometimes. - Yeah. I feel like that's the\ntheme of this whole podcast. Yeah. - Oh. (laughs) - What's the most\nembarrassed you've ever been on your podcast? - So, I don't know if\nyou've experienced this, but I am generally embarrassed\nby most things I say inside my head.\n- Yeah. - So like when I say\nsomething, like now, it's just, there's a voice inside\nmy head that goes, oh... - Yeah.\n- Like what... (laughs) You're a disappointment. Like the parent patting you on the back, the hand stops working. - Yeah.\n- Just slows down. Yeah. And then there's an awkward silence. You don't know what to say next. That's really embarrassing usually. - Yeah. So I used to work as\na journalist so I know how to sit with the silence\nand try to drag it out of you. - [Lex] See what I did there? (laughs) - You gave up. You pulled out. - I quit.\n- You're like... - I'm sweating. I quit. I'm literally sweating. Okay. - Also 'cause you're\nin a full fucking suit. What is that, like, how\ndid that come about? - Actually it was probably\nMIT is because everybody was dressing in like\nsweatpants, a very chill wear, and I was like, I like\ntaking everything seriously. It just felt like a, it was my way of saying F\nyou to the way things are. 'Cause I like, I always admire Richard Feynman and I\nlike it how there's like a classiness to it. So I don't know if it's\nfor visual purposes but it's just how I feel\nwhen I put on a suit. It makes me feel like I'm gonna take this really, really seriously. - Yeah.\n- And if I embarrass myself, it's all my fault 'cause I tried... There's no excuse. I tried 100%."

      "text": "The interesting thing about your TED talk, to go to a dark topic... - Mm. This is what happened\nwhen I walked off stage? - [Lex] No, what happened\nwhen you walked off stage? - Found out that I had a brain tumor. Was that not where you're going? - Yes.\n- There's something else dark about my, yeah.\n- Well, yes. I thought you knew through the TED talk, you found out right after. - I mean the reason that\nI found out was partly because of the TED talk\n'cause my mom came into town to be there for it, and my right eyelid was\nswollen and it had kind of been swelling over a while. And I even got comments\nabout it on my YouTube channel and I thought it was\nallergies 'cause I was like, oh, it's just pollen allergies, it's just affecting my one\neye 'cause maybe I sleep mostly on that side. I don't know. And my mom came into the States and then Vancouver for my TED talk and she's like, Simone, you have to like\nhave a scan or see what's up. Like, we have to go to the doctor. And she really pushed me to do it 'cause I was like, I'm fine. And I had an MRI scan on like 5:00 PM on a Friday night. My boyfriend at the time\nwas there and I remember like halfway through an MRI scan, they kind of pull you out and they inject contrast fluid or this\nlike thing that, yeah, just gives 'em another type of scan. And the nurse looked at me\nin this way and was like, how long have you had symptoms for? And that's when I knew\nthat they'd found something and then they like shove\nyou back into the machine for another 20 minutes. And my ex was just seeing\nlike them like zooming in and out of my scans and there was like this obviously something\nthat just looked wrong in there and they sent\nme to the ER and I found out that I had a brain tumor\nthe size of a golf ball that probably had been growing\nsince I was a teenager. So it'd been growing\nover like 10, 15 years. And yeah, I had surgery to\nremove it and then it kept on growing, the parts\nthat they couldn't remove and I went through radiation treatment. So that was like two years\nthat just was kind of dedicated to just getting better and getting back to where I am now. And I remember like I\nwas so stoked about 2020 'cause I was like this is\nthe first year that I'm not held back by my health and\nI'm like finally gonna be able to do everything I'm better, and then the pandemic happens and\nyou're kind of just like, okay, just in the backseat of\nwhat's happening and things that are outta my control again. - In your public, you made\na couple of videos about... - Yeah. - About it. I have a brain\ntumor, my brain tumor's back. You kind of, you know, you name your tumor\nBrian, you kind of make it a light-hearted thing, but so you don't reveal\nmuch of the darkness. But were you scared? What\nwere some low points? - Yeah, of course I was scared. I mean it's terrifying. It's like, and also when\nit's in your brain, like, you know, I was like\ntake any other part of me but don't take my brain. No. It's this unfathomable thing\nthat happens when you're like, I'm healthy, how could this\npossibly be a brain tumor? Like my eye is swollen.\nLike there's nothing there. I haven't had any seizures, I haven't had any cognitive issues, I haven't had any headaches even, like how is that even possible? So you go through a\nlot of different stages of just trying to understand what it is. And I think I remember being\nhit like right as I found out when we were in like\nan Uber, poor Uber driver, from where I had my MRI scan\nto the ER where they sent me. And I was really both really\ngrateful that I've gotten so much more outta life\nthan I ever thought I would. Like I've had a hell of a life and even if it would've\nended really early, I would've done so much\nmore than I ever thought. But I was also really, really sad that I hadn't had kids yet. Like that was my big grief of like, fuck, I haven't had time to have kids yet. But no, it's terrifying. I mean the prospect of\nsomebody cutting up your head, like that's terrifying. But it honestly wasn't as bad\nas I thought it was gonna be. - What about the radiation treatment? What are some things that,\nyou know, people should, well you learned about it, about the process and about yourself through that that people\nmight be interested about? - I think surgery was\nboth harder and easier than radiation treatment because... It was harder because it\nwas so much more intense and it's such a dramatic thing, like going to the hospital\nthat morning and being like, I don't know, and you feel so\nawful when you wake up and... But then the recovery\nfrom it was pretty linear. Like almost every week I\nwould get a little bit better. The thing about radiation is\nthat it was not linear at all, and it kind of drained me in this weird, like it was so hard to predict. And also they put me on these, I spent months feeling like\nI was high out of my mind, and I couldn't process reality in a way that I normally would. Like, everything just felt\noff, like I felt, yeah, I felt like I was high on drugs, and I kept on asking my\ndoctors what was going on and they're like, no, no, no, no, don't think it's anything related. And I was on this Alzheimer's\nmedicine that they put you on to prevent dementia\nfrom radiation treatment, like kind of as a preventative. And I found all these\nsubreddits of people using that Alzheimer's medicine to\nget high, and people be like, \"Oh my god bro, I took like 20 milligrams\nyesterday and I was high out of my mind,\" and I'm like,\nI'm on 30 milligrams a day. Like of course it feels weird. And that was honestly\none of the scariest parts of it because that was the\nfirst time where I felt like it genuinely affected my\nway of processing reality. And yeah, I was so relieved\nwhen I found out that that was what was causing it. 'Cause I felt like I was going crazy. But even after surgery, like I woke up and I felt like myself. Like everything was,\nI got no brain injury. So obviously this is like\nmy experience from somebody who came out of it pretty unscathed, who didn't get any brain\ninjuries and didn't have to do any of that recovery. It's more just the recovery\nfrom like the physical act of somebody cutting your\nskull open and taking a large chunk out. - Did you research all the\nthings that can go wrong? - No.\n- During surgery? - No. I honestly am, I'm a\nbit surprised by how I acted. Just pausing for you to pour.\nYou're welcome, editors. - This is like a commercial. - (laughs) This is like work\ninjury from being a YouTuber. This all like freeze if\nthere's audio that comes in. - Ah...\n- Ah. Yeah. Sponsored by tap water. I was surprised by how\nlittle I was willing to think critically about\nwhat my doctors told me to do. Like I, very early on, the neurologist that I worked with, he was the one who was\non call at the ER the day where I came in and he was\nthe one who ended up doing my surgery and he kind\nof became like my rock in this and I just 100%\ntrusted him and he turned out to be an amazing doctor\nand like did a great job and was just like, and... So I got so, so lucky. But I remember my mom being like, oh, but we should like talk about\nsecond opinions and like we should try to do more research. And I was like so unwilling\nto do that because opening up to the idea that there are multiple ways or multiple things that might be right or wrong was so terrifying. Like I wanted there to just be like, no, this is the only option,\nthis is what we need to do. And if I started questioning\nthat then I don't know if I would've been able\nto go through with it. So yeah, it was a strange, I just really wanted to trust the doctors that I worked with and I\nwas very scared to question them in any way."

      "text": "- How did that process change\nyour relationship with death? Are you afraid of death? - No.\n- Do you ponder your mortality?\n- Yeah, I think it took away a part of youth for me. - [Lex] Like the innocence? - Yeah, I mean you kind of\nthink of terrible things as something that happens to other people, and death and illness... So I think it kind of\nfast tracked that for me, but it mostly changed\nmy relationship to life. It changed, it's made me so\nmuch more gentle with myself. Like going through illness, it forces you to redefine\nwhat it means to be good. And before being good had been\npushing myself really hard. It had been working, and I don't know, just being really hard with\nmyself and disciplined, and when you're healing from something, being good is listening to\nyour body, it's resting. It's like really being in tune with what your health,\nwhere your health is at. And I think that is something\nthat's kind of stuck with me since then. I'm like so much more gentle\nand delicate with myself. - And with others? Are you? - Ah fuck it. I think it definitely, it's like when you're young and healthy it's really hard to-\n- Yeah. - Know what it feels like to be ill. And I remember, you know, you like go to yoga class\nand you'd be like, oh my god, this is too slow. Like I want it to be, I have so much more\nenergy like I need to... And when I was recovering\nfrom my brain surgery, there was this yoga studio nearby my house and they had yoga for\nseniors and I was so stoked 'cause I was like, oh, this is the yoga class\nI'll be able to take. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I think that was really\neye-opening of just like, there's no, you kind of imagine\nthat it's just like, oh, just push yourself harder. But no, that's not it. With age or sickness or it's just, you gotta be so gentle\nwith yourself and you have to cater to people where they're at. - Yeah. And just appreciation of\nthis like biological vehicle you get and you should take care of it? - Being sick sucks. - Yeah.\n- It's awful. And I really am really\nmotivated to postpone that for as much as I can. And also I was so tremendously\ngrateful when I got ill that I felt like I\nhad so much to take from, like I had so many energy reservoirs, I'd spent my life taking\npretty decent care of my body and like exercising and\neating well and like not wrecking my body in any way. And I felt like this was the\nfirst time where that was so critical and I felt like\nmy body was ready for it. You know? - I thought you were\ngonna go the other way. Like, you can take care of your\nbody all you want and it's, bad stuff happens. So you should go on drug\nbinges and go wild and do crazy things and... - I mean I also had that\nthought where I was like, I fucking floss every day. How do I have a brain\ntumor? I've been good. Like why does this happen to me? But more so it was like\nmy body was so resilient and ready for it, and I was\nreally, really proud of it. - Yeah, it's amazing that\nthe human body's able to recover from even the harshest things. - Yeah, it's wild. And my brain. So after, after surgery, 'cause yeah, I had a brain tumor the\nsize of a golf ball kinda behind my right eye. And after brain surgery\nyou kind of just have this big hole in your\nhead, like this void, and usually your brain stays that way. Like it retains the shape\neven after the brain tumor is gone. But for some reason my\nbrain was feeling really ambitious and it has\ncompletely flopped back and I have almost like a\nnormal looking brain now, where doctors are like, oh, we would almost not be able\nto tell that you had one. So yeah, that just blew my mind\nof being like, when did it, was that why I had all those\nheadaches after surgery? It's just my brain being like, ah. - Trying, working. Yeah."

      "text": "Oh, pretty cool Thing I wanted to ask you about is the Every Day\nCalendar that you worked on. - [Simone] Mm-hm. - That was a long time.\nThat took a long time. - Yeah, so basically I\ndesigned this calendar, like I wanted to start\nmeditating every day, but it's really hard to\nmeditate every day to like kind of build that habit. And what I would do is\nI would make these grids in my notebooks where I\ncould like check a box for every day. Like I just wanted like a little, ding, I did it and like this\nthing of accountability, but then I was like, this is, I don't wanna have a\nnotebook that I do this in. Like I want an art piece\nthat I can hang on my wall, like accountability art. And I made this thing called the Every Day Calendar, which\nhas an entire year on it. So it's 365 days and if\nyou tap any of the days you light it up and we\nturn it into a Kickstarter campaign and it's now a\nproduct that I'm selling through my product\nbusiness, the Yetch Store. - What's it called?\n- The Yetch Store. - Yeah. And that for people who are\nconfused is the right way to pronounce your last name. - It's right but it's so wrong. It makes, my last name\nis spelled G-I-E-R-T-Z. - Who does that song? \"If Loving You Is Wrong I\nDon't Want to Be Right.\" - Yeah. Pronouncing my last name, yeah. - That's all makes\nbecause, what's his name? From the Office. He covers it... From the British Office, which\nis the better Office. Okay. Tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent. So you said you created the\nEvery Day Calendar to make a more beautiful, in quotes, and more sacred gold\nstar system on a wall, not a notebook that gets\nthrown into a drawer. - Yeah. Wow. Well said, past me. - (laughs) You said that\nmaking this calendar taught you a lot, in quotes. I feel like a real\ninvestigative journalist. You've said, in 2018- - Yeah, I'm waiting for the gotcha. - Can you share some of\nthe lessons you've learned? Like what do you mean you've learned a lot from making this calendar.\n- Oh. - What are we talking about? - As somebody who builds things, manufacturing something is\nsuch an unrelated process, like making one of\nsomething and making 10,000 of something, like they're\nnot even distant cousins. Like it's completely\ndifferent beasts to tackle. And yeah, so that was one of it. Everything takes so much\nlonger than you think it's going to. I did a Kickstarter\ncampaign that we launched in 2018 after my surgery and, yeah, it's just, you know, you think you're so\ngenerous with the timelines, we still ended up being a\nyear late but we shipped. We're good. But yeah, I mean I'm trying\nto get my product business off the ground. We launched in May and it's\njust, yeah it's just a pain. As somebody who's terrified\nof disappointing people, I'm like why have I\nchosen some of the jobs where it's the easiest\nto disappoint people? - [Lex] You can disappoint\npeople at scale. No. - Yeah, I can disappoint\npeople at scale and also them actually having paid me\nmoney to deliver on something, which is a terrible transaction, but it's, I am just stoked to realize\nthat I love the job still. Like I love the product\ndevelopment aspect of it. I love trying to design\nstuff for manufacturing and figure it out and like\nanticipate how people are gonna use your products and like the Every Day Calendar, I\nmean we've sold thousands of them now, they're all over the world and it's like people\nactually finding something useful that I made and\nimplementing them into their lives. It's just mind boggling. - Especially 'cause this is\ntracking habits, good habits. So this is... - Or bad ones, you can do it wherever. You can use it however you want. - I went in a drinking binge again today. - Yeah.\n- Success. Great success. - Kicked another kid. - What does it take to\nmass manufacture something? What did you learn about that? Like what are, can you\nlike elucidate the gap between the one, the\nprototype versus the like product development for mass manufacturer? - I mean for one of it is\nlike, yeah, the manufacturing, the tooling that they use in manufacturing and to do things in a cost effective way is really different. Like I can make a one-off, then it's gonna take me 17 hours, but obviously you can't\nspend 17 hours per calendar when you're doing something in factory. I think it's that, like quality\ncontrol is such a beast. You cannot trust anybody\ntelling you that things are gonna be okay. Like you have to have such trust issues, and it's also terrifying. I mean as somebody who's doing\neverything independently, I haven't raised any capital for it. Like it's all self\ninvested and we're doing it all in-house. It's just, you know, yeah, I could buy 10,000 calendars\nbut then what if all of them are, have a\nmanufacturing issue or, you know, it's just terrifying because\nthe risks are so high, but also I got to this\npoint where, for one, this is something that I\nwanted to do for a long time, but something that going\nthrough health problems taught me is how fragile my business model is. Because, I mean, I'm basically running an influencer business where\nI make videos oh YouTube, and then I have an ad spot\nand I talk about a brand. So like I'm a human\nbillboard, which is fine, it grants me a lot of\nfreedom to play around. But if I am not well enough to\nbe on a stage, giving talks, or be in front of a\ncamera, everything stops. Like it's such a pillar\nof a business and it can topple over at any given\nmoment or like YouTube could change the algorithm, like legislation could catch up and change how you're able to\nadvertise on the internet. Like it's so frail and I\nreally felt like I need to diversify what I'm\ndoing and also just to keep it interesting for myself. So what I decided was to\nstart a product business because also it's kind of\nthis perfect combination of businesses where I can\nturn my YouTube channel into an R&D department\n'cause I have a reason to constantly be exploring\nthings and turning out new products. I can also do that as early\naudience testing and see what people are actually excited about. And if there's something\nthat I think would make an interesting product, I can pass that over to the product business and then once I'm ready to market that and sell it, I can pass it over to the YouTube channel. So it's like, I can kind of, once I realized that YouTube\ndidn't feel like an end goal for me, I was like, okay, then I can use it as a tool to accomplish these other things that\nI wanna do and this was one of them. So yeah, it's a lot that went into it. - And one of the tools, like I said, is R&D but it's also kind of advertisement for the cool stuff that you're doing. I think Mr. Beast is one of the creators that's also starting to\nunderstand this power of this reputation that\nyou've built of like people trust you, like they love\nyou, to do cool stuff, they trust that you put your\nheart and soul into a thing. - Yeah.\n- And so like, and they feel your pain\nand the struggle too. You know? Like if a product, like, for example, say the Every Day Calendar,\nlike there was issues in manufacturing something like this- - It would be hard. Yeah. - They would feel the pain of that and they would still support. I mean that that's the\nbeauty of it when you have the actual person right there struggling with their lows and highs. - That's a decision\nthat I made really early on where I was like, the Yetch Store is supported by me but it's separate from me. It's not merchandise. You don't have to know who\nI am or care about who I am to be interested in this product. And if you go on the website, yetch.store, plug, it's like it's, I'm on the about page, Y-E-T-C-H.store, like you have to go to\nthe about page to find anything about me. Like it's definitely not\nlike this is Simone's brand, and I think anybody who's\nfollowed me for a long time will see that like my\npersonality is sprinkled into it, but it's still like clean off of me. And I think that's also\nbecause I wanted something that was separate from me. 'Cause I am also running\nout of narcissism, believe it or not. I'm like, I don't feel like I wanna, I don't want it to be about me and I want it to be something that\ncan also run independently of me and doesn't, like I wanna\nbe able to retire my face, and still do like the other\nstuff because I think it's fun, but I don't want that\nto be the core of it. - What other kind of stuff have you worked on for the product design, for Yetch? - So I mean a lot of the products, I decided to launch the\nstore with a really small roster of products because\ndeveloping products is such a, it's such upfront, heavy, like cost-wise and just\ninvestment, such a, it's very big upfront investment. So, and I know that it would take a while, or I knew it would take a\nwhile for me to kind of find the right tonality and visual\nlanguage for the brand. So I just wanted to launch\nit, have it be out there, start working on it, start like learning more\nabout what it entails, even if we just had a\nsmall roster of products. So we've released it with,\nwe have a puzzle... (laughs) - Yes.\n- This is just a whim, but I wanted to release a puzzle that has one piece missing. So it's actually, as far as I can tell, it's the world's first\nofficially incomplete puzzle. You get 499 outta 500 pieces.\nI keep the 500th piece. So I have a box in my workshop with everybody's missing pieces. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I don't know what to do with it yet, but someday it will come to me. - Profound artistic statement. - It is something, it's definitely something\nand I'm surprised by how many of them we've\nsold, which I've also like, I kind of wanted to have\nthat product out there. 'Cause I was like, can you\nimagine having a pitch deck, if I do ever raise money of being like, you know how good I am at selling things? I sold people 5,000 incomplete puzzles. - Incomplete puzzles.\n- Yeah. Also have, you know, it's\nlike a lot of the products, I call them basket fillers, like they're kind of just like\nstuff where I'm like, yeah, this is like easy to\nthrow into your basket. I mean we have these\nrings, I'm wearing them. So there's a screwdriver ring, which is a Phillips head screwdriver, and then a screw ring\nthat kind of has a recess, like a Phillips head screw, have these sawdust socks\nthat make you look like your feet are covered in sawdust. Like you spend all time\nin the all day in the shop without having to put any\nof the actual effort in. But then we have four more\nproducts in the pipeline that we're working on and\nthat are kind of the more, the big ambitious products\nthat are more in line with what I want the brand to be. Like the tagline is unique\nsolutions to every day problems. And it's just a lot of\nlike trying to develop novel takes on existing products. - So something where the\nfunction becomes a bigger part of the design?\n- Yeah. - And so what's the process of creating something like that? Like even Every Day Calendar? So like what are some challenges that are interesting along the way? So you have to sketch it out,\nyou have to like brainstorm, draw things out and then\ncreate a schematic and see like how, how do you know what it's\ngoing to look like visually? - You don't. So the Every Day Calendar, the first, so I just built it for myself first. Like that did not come\nas a product idea first. And that's kind of been\nthe process that I've had for a lot of things. Like I make it for myself\nand then I'm like, oh, maybe other people would\nfind this useful too. So the Every Day Calendar,\nthe first prototype I made, it had actually physical\nmechanical toggle switches. So 365 toggle switches\nthat you could flip. So if you worked out\nthat day or meditated, for me it was meditating, you can just flip that\nswitch and that was great. But when I started evaluating\nit as a product, it's, if you have 365 of something in a product, like the runaway cost is crazy. So the cheapest option, most reliable option we could\nfind was capacitive touch. So basically it's a touch\ninterface and the front plate is a circuit board itself. So it's this like circuit\nboard that's designed in this really fancy way. So it looks like a beautiful piece of art. Not to toot my own horn too much, but it's actually a circuit board, which I also thought was\nreally interesting of like using this that people\nusually hide away in products. And it felt like a nod to\nmy career in electronics as well of being like, no, let's make it pretty and let's make it, put it front and forward. But yeah, I mean what I'm\nrealizing now more and more is like, there's so many of, like I would love to turn the\npuzzle table into a product, but then it's like that\nwould be a $7,000 table. And I don't wanna sell a table for $7,000. So you're kind of limited\nto the price bracket you're in and it's like\nyour margins are tough. Like maintaining your margins\nare really, really tough. And as somebody who's like, I would love to sell the stuff\nthat we're doing cheaper, but you just, it's just not feasible. Like you need those\nmargins to survive. And... - Well one of the genius\nthings in the conversations I've had with Elon is\nthe ability through sort of systematic questioning\nof how things have been done in the past to discuss\nwhat is the lowest cost way to solve a problem. And so he's very good at getting to, like with Optimus robot for\nexample, the humanoid robot, how do you get the cost down? - [Lex] Yeah. - And that seems to be like\none of the essential things to do in any product that\nyou have to mass manufacture is constantly discuss like\nhow do we simplify, simplify? - It's definitely a design\nlimitation that's interesting, it's both hard and interesting to work within and that's such a\ndifferent thing as well. It's like, I mean as\nI talked about before, like what is the context in\nwhich you're creating things? Like I'm still building things,\nI'm still inventing things, but I change the context\nand it has a very different set of limitations and\nconstantly trying to simplify your product to make it cheaper and, yeah, it's a really interesting\nand different type of design process. - You can lose some of\nthe magic though, right? Like people can do that\na little bit too much. I think Apple is famous, like Jony Ive is famous\nfor sort of focusing on the design first and not\nworrying about the cost later, 'cause you don't wanna sacrifice... There's some stuff that's gonna\ncost more, but it keeps... - Yeah.\n- Some of the magic. - I think it's for some of the products that we're working on,\nit's like, I'm like, let's just make it the best\nwe think it can be and then we can scale back from there. Like, just like let's not\nimpose these limitations on ourselves upfront. Like let's just make it\nthe most beautiful version of itself and then we\ncan decide what we wanna compromise with or compromise on. Yeah. - That's what I say every day\nwhen I look in the mirror. You just make the most beautiful... - And then we can compromise. Yeah. - [Lex] We'll just discuss- - It's why you put on that suit. - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - And then see how goes\nwrong later. All right.

Where\ndid the idea come from? - The idea came from that I really wanted an electric pickup truck.\n- Yeah. - Like I'm only really\ndriven electric because I got my driver's license pretty\nlate and I'm like one of that first generation drivers, it's like probably never\ngonna have a gas vehicle. But yeah. This was in 2018 as well. 2018 was a big year.\n- Yeah. - Yeah. Or 2019, I can't remember. And I figured that we\ncould just make our own. - So you took a Tesla?\n- Tesla Model 3. - Model 3.\n- Mm-hm. - And you cut off a\npiece of it and you turn into a pickup truck. What's the, (laughs)\nit looks pretty badass. So like what are some of the\nchallenges of doing that? It's unlike other projects you've done. - Yeah, it's very much\noutside of my realm. Like I'm not a car person. I haven't worked on cars\nbefore so we brought in a big team and had\nanother project manager for it and stuff. 'Cause also like, cars, you definitely don't\nwant things to go wrong. Like there's no part of me\nthat wants to fuck around and make something that's\ngonna be really unsafe for me or for other people who\nare driving with me. So yeah, I mean it was\nabout a year of planning, and then we got the car\nand then we spent a month just tearing it apart\nand trying to make it... I was so set like I really wanted the car just for its function, and I was like, I'm so fine\nwith it if it's really ugly. But then we managed to make\nit actually look really good. - Oh so that wasn't\npart of the discussion, like how the final thing looks? - I wasn't that fussed about it. I was like I just want\nit for its function. Like I really want this car, I don't want it because it looks cool. But then it ended up\nlooking pretty cool as well. And I'm really, I mean\neven now a couple of years later when there are some\nmore options of electric pickup trucks, I still stan Truckla. Like, she's, like Rivian, Ford F-150, like they're all great but they're giant. - You're sitting there on a\nporch in your cowboy hat... - Yep.\n- Drinking whiskey and saying- - With my cattle dog. Yeah. - Shotguns... - I wanted like small '90s pickup truck. - Back to shitty robots. You used parts of previous robots a lot. What's like a memorable example of that? It's just the graveyard\nof parts? In the workshop? - I've gotten better at\nkeeping projects intact. In the beginning I used to disassemble every project 'cause it was also a much more stringent budget. So if I needed a motor then\nI would like steal it off of an existing robot or a previous robot. But I've got a really good\nat not doing that now, because I'm like, maybe\none day I wanna have a museum exhibit and then\nthey would be nice to have all of those machines\nintact and not having to rebuild them. - Centuries from now, they'll, you know, you can look at Benjamin\nFranklin's house... - [Simone] Oh yeah, nobody's\ngonna look at my house. Yeah. - Simone Giertz's house. - No.\n- Just some weird shit. - Yeah. That goes great\nwith my idea of myself. - (laughs) With the autobiography? Yeah. - Yeah. - You said that people keep requesting in the comments that... - That I put a on dildo on it?\n- Yeah. - [Lex] I have- - Wait was that actually\nwhat you were gonna ask? - Yeah, I have dildo written in my notes. - I thought I just made it\ninto a raunchy punchline. You were actually gonna get there. Yeah, that was in the early\ndays in the shitty robot days. But now I have a filter\non my YouTube channel for every possible spelling of dildo. - So I mean, people want to probably\nsexualize robots, right? Or they put-\n- They wanna sexualize my relationship with them. Yeah.\n- Oh... - You know, 'cause I have\nmajority male followers, and they're so sweet and\nso like respectful, 99%. But I realize like, there is a lot of, I've realized that\nsociety hasn't taught men how to have female role models, and the way that people channel\nit is through being like, oh, it's because I wanna\nfuck her or I wanna date her or I wanna marry her. And I'm like, I don't think\nyou want any of those things. I think you actually just admire my work, but you don't know how\nto look up to a woman. - Yeah. That's beautifully put."

And it was almost scary\nwhere I was like, oh, I've just been like playing around with these tiny versions of\nthis and I'm like, oh my god, everybody, robotics is cool and fun! And then you get in there and you're like, this is kind of terrifying. - You were platforming\nthe very things that will destroy human civilization.\n- Yes. - You're making it fun and entertaining. - I'm the mouthpiece and\nI'm like getting people into robotics and\nengineering and we're all just building our demise. - Yeah.\n- At accelerating speed. No, but I mean I had\nthat in like as the same with also with like\ncompanies who are saying that they're never gonna\nput weapons on their robots and then have military\ncontracts and stuff like that and you're like,\nthis is dark and scary. Fortunately I haven't gotten\na lot of requests for it. - Yeah. Drones are terrifying. Especially... - Drones are fucking terrifying, and it's really, everything... I mean we humans are so\ngood at creative ways of killing and fucking each other. It's like almost how everything goes. It's like, and it's, yeah, I'm terrified of the future\nwhere we are gonna use more robots to kill each other. - And come up with new and\nnew creative ways to kill and hurt each other.\n- Yeah. - Emotionally,\npsychologically, physically. - [Simone] Yeah. - Speaking of which, what\nare your thoughts about, I don't know if you've\nbeen paying attention, but ChatGPT, the advancement\nin language models and artificial intelligence. Have you added speaking\ncapabilities to any of your devices? - I have Siri on. Yeah. I used to have an Amazon Echo in my house, but then I removed it. It just freaked me out\nthat I could whisper from my bed and it heard me. - Yeah.\n- I'd be like, \"Alexa, play Spotify.\" It'd be like, \"Playing Spotify!\" - Yeah.\n- Oh fuck. I... I think it is a powerful\ntool that we are not fully ready for. - Yeah.\n- And I don't know, I think the internet is\nkind of a parade of us using powerful things in\nharmful ways and I think chatbots are really, really exciting. I am stoked to have a\npersonal assistant that's like a virtual assistant that\nactually does a good job and can solve problems for me. But, yeah, it also feels like it can get dark really, really quickly. - Yeah. 'Cause you can form close connections like we're talking about with\nit and then it can be used to manipulate you. Manipulate you in terms of what is true and manipulating you in terms of getting you to buy stuff.\n- Yeah. - Or maybe because at least\nfor now it's centralized, getting everybody to think the same way. - I mean for, I mean it's the same in like algorithms being used to radicalize people or kind of having that as a consequence of\nthe way that they work and combine that with a\nreally advanced language model and like you can control\npeople's worldview in a way that you couldn't. I mean it's just, it's wild and I think\nwe're not ready for it.

So I wanted other people\nto anthropomorphize them, but I don't think I did necessarily. I'm trying to think of\na piece of technology that I've kind of projected\nfeelings upon, but no, I can't. - So sometimes what makes me\nanthropomorphize something, even though I built it, is\nthere's element of surprise. So especially with machine learning, you're surprised by the\nkind of things it does. Have you ever been surprised by a robot? - No. 'Cause they're all pretty dumb.

I was like, hey, can I\ncome and write for you? And they were like, oh, actually we are going to an\nevent in Gothenburg tomorrow, do you wanna come? - [Lex] Yeah. - And I was like, wow, this is a lot. It's like 11:00 PM at\nnight, but sure, I'll come. And I went there to their office, I'd never really met them. And I'm like, this is kind of scary.

They'd like, I went there and\nI was like, \"Hey, what's up?\" And they were all kind of\nignoring me and just like not looking at me or interacting with me, until they realized that Simon was a girl because we'd only talked over\nemail and they were like, oh, this guy named Simon is gonna come. And then they were like, oh, fuck, Simon. It's actually Simone. - Yeah.\n- And it's a girl. So I kind of like slid\ninto that in a very, very strange way. And I did that for a year, but then I got kicked out of an interview with Alexander Gustafsson,\nand I was like, oh- - Your pronunciation is so good. - Yeah. (laughs) And then I just kind of\nnever went back and I was done with it and now I'm\nnot allowed to do martial arts because of brain stuff. So, I've kind of put\nall of that behind me.

And I'm just not as, cannot as 100% just cheer\nas somebody beats somebody else up into a pulp. - Yeah. Especially considering\nthe effects you might have on the brain.\n- Mm-hm. - May I ask why you got kicked out of this Alexander\nGustafsson interview. Was it anything fun? - So, it is, no, it wasn't. I didn't intend to get kicked out. I didn't realize I was\ngonna get kicked out. So it was, Alexander Gustafsson\nwas gonna fight Jon Jones. - Yeah.\n- And he had just, he was kind of like this golden boy in Sweden and he had just\ncome out to the press that he had actually been\nto jail for violent crimes, and all I wanted to ask, all I asked was what was\nthe reason that you wanted to bring that forward now? And apparently that was\ncompletely like blacklisted, but I hadn't gotten\nbriefed about it at all. And the PR man, head a PR of the UFC\nwas just yelling at me and they kicked me out of,\nGrand Hotel in Stockholm. And I immediately called my\nmom and I was like, \"Mom, you will not believe what just happened. I got kicked out of an\ninterview in at Grand Hotel.\" Because in the '90s she got\nkicked out of an interview with Mel Gibson from the Grand Hotel, so that's like runs in the\nfamily.

Those are like technologically speaking just such fundamentally different places. - I mean I moved to China when I was 16. - Yeah.\n- And I went there as an exchange student. So that is before I had ever\ntouched upon those things. And it was, and then I went\nback when I was 19 to work as an English teacher for a little bit. It was... It was incredibly challenging to be there. - The language barrier,\nthe language, the culture? - All of it. I mean I was like, now when\nI look at 16 year olds, I'm like, you're a baby. And I moved, sorry, 10 to 16\nyear olds listening to this. But like, I just can't believe I did that. And yeah, I didn't speak the language, I got placed in like a small city with almost no foreigners. It was just a constant audience\nof people staring at you, because they haven't interacted with a lot of foreigners before.

I know so many things. What do you think this is? - Is it from when I have\nmy Amazon Echo installed? - Yeah-\n- Yeah, so... - [Lex] Made a few contacts. - I came home from China first\ntime I was there for a year. It's one of the most turned\nupside down days of my life. I spent a year there and I was so excited. I had really rough year\nand I was so excited just to come home and\nlike be a child again. I remember thinking and just\nlike feeling like I belonged. And then I came home and I\nfound out that my parents had separated when I was gone. And they hadn't told me\nbecause they wanted to like not affect my stay there, which I think was 100% the\nright decision of them to make. But I kind of came home to\na house that was starting to get picked apart. And- - Such a big shock to you world. - It was, both yes and no. I think I remember I\njust sat down on my bed and I was like, well, this\nisn't what I expected, but I guess I'll move to\nKenya because I was one of the few, there were a\nfew Swedish boarding schools in the world. There was one in Brussels, Paris, London, and then one in Nairobi. And I didn't wanna miss more\nschool because I'd taken a gap year when I went to China. So I was like, I guess I'll go to Nairobi. And I'm thinking now, like I think if my parents\nhad stayed together, granted, it was amazing that they did, made the right decision in every way. But my roots kind of never\ngrew back after that. And I think I just kept on\nmoving abroad and moving around and being really\nrestless and, yeah... And... - Have you ever been able\nto find a home, spiritually? - No, I have a home. Yeah. I mean I have a home in the\npeople around me and I have a lot of different homes. You know, it's, I think\nwhat I'm realizing more and more is like you cannot live without consequence and compromise. And sometimes I can envy\npeople who have that like same friend group that they\nhad their entire life or that, you know, just really belong in a place. And I realize that would be amazing. But I've chosen different experiences. And one of the upsides\nof that is I can feel home almost anywhere. One of the downsides of\nthat is that I cannot feel fully at home anywhere. - Wow. That's deeply and darkly poetic. - [Simone] Yeah. Do you feel at home? - Probably the way you put\nit is really beautifully put. Yeah. No, I have to find\nhome in the people I love. - [Simone] Yeah."

Maybe high school students,\nmaybe college students, on how they can have a\ncareer they can be proud of, or life they can be proud of? - Oh my god, Lex. Hmm... You know, it's, this is not the advice, but there are very few\nmoments in a career that feel as good as you think they are going to. And there are very few\nmoments of feeling really proud of yourself. Like, I feel like I often\njust feel like I'm not doing it well enough or big enough or, and now I just had one of\nthose moments like hearing you say that I'm like, oh,\nI'm actually doing okay. I think my main advice is\nenthusiasm is a much more potent fuel in life than duty. And just because something\nis boring doesn't mean that it's important. I kind of realized for\nmyself that like I'm so much better at the things I enjoy, but school doesn't really\nteach us how to stay excited about something and how to stay enthusiastic about something. And if you can find that, then like you got a\ngold mine of potential. So I kind of had to\nreprogram myself to be like, just because this is fun, doesn't mean that it's not important, because I had so much guilt\nabout it in this weird way or where I'm like, no, this is too fun. This can't be work. And I'm\nlike, no, it's still work. The boring stuff isn't more important. - And the vice versa as you said, just because it's boring\nand hard doesn't mean it's the right thing to do? - Yeah.\n- That's interesting. I'm gonna have to take that\nadvice and think through it. 'Cause I'm, genetically, I'm built a little bit like\nif this is really unpleasant, it's probably good for me. - [Simone] Yeah. - And it's a dangerous thing to think. Sometimes it's true, sometimes it's not. - Yeah. No. And it's like what comes\nreally easy and where do you have that kind of effortless momentum and enthusiasm and that\nis kind of the sweet spot. I think that I'm also really\nhappy that I spent time trying out so many different jobs. I mean, I've had so many\ndifferent jobs before I did it and I would do things\nfor a year and then I quit and it feels like I tried\non a bunch of different pants and you're like, okay,\nI can kind of wear this, but they're like not super\ncomfortable or I don't love the look of them or whatever. And now I feel like I've\nfound this pair of pants that just like fits me\nperfectly and that perfectly caters to my strengths and my weaknesses. Like I used to work as an editor for the Swedish government,\nand I remember thinking like, oh, I need to be okay\nthat not a lot of things are happening and that\nthings are moving slowly and that the work is\nkind of like monotonous. And then I realize like, or maybe I should be in a workplace where it's a benefit or\nstrength that I want a lot of things to happen and that\nI can handle a high speed. - [Lex] Yeah. - You know, and I think\nthat is really such a good question to ask as well. Like what are my strengths?\nWhat are my weaknesses? And then what context are most\nof these things strengths? - If you're know that, if\nyou know the measurements, you can find the right fitting pants? - Yeah.

I mean, as much as I'm working\nwith a team, it's like, yeah, I just wanna work in\na bigger project and kind of have that sense of, wow,\nwe're like doing this together. 'Cause I think that accesses\nmy pride a lot better than just being proud of myself. It's so much easier for\nme to be proud of a team than for me to be proud of myself. - That's probably good\nadvice for people who are doing creative work on YouTube too. To work on a team. - Yeah.

Like anything you do on\nthe internet is kind of, I think of things as\ntattoos on my internet and on my internet self. And I'm really happy that\nI said no to some things early in my career that I know that I would've regretted now. And you know, just think\nof it in the long term, like going viral is\noverwhelming and so stressful and so fun, but like so intense. And I'm really happy\nthat I managed to build that into a more long-term\ncareer than just have it be something that passed. - And come down from the viral moment and maintain your humanity? - Yeah. And also really deliberately\ndefining what success means to you, because\nthere are so many reasons or so many definitions that\nother people will give you. And especially when you're\nworking on the internet, there are just numbers\nupon numbers that are like, you're doing well, you're not doing well. And something I'm really\nhappy that I did was early on, I really try to think of like, what does success look like for me? And I realized that it's\nnot having the world's biggest YouTube channel, it's being proud of the projects that I put\nout and having full say in how I spend my time. Like that is the most\nimportant thing to me. And if I had a huge YouTube\nchannel and I was making so much money, but I kind\nof had this machine run me rather than the other way around, like to me it's so important\nto be able to wake up in the morning and be like, I\ndon't wanna do this any more. And for that to be okay. And I think I defined\nthat for myself early on and I've really tried\nto live by it and made decisions after that. And I'm really happy that I did that. - And also you're, with the store, with the design you're doing now, you're putting a little\nbit of love in the products you create at scale. I mean, that's what Jony Ive\ndid. That's the cool thing. So you can create something\nbeautiful and then people can share that love at scale. - It's terrifying and beautiful\nand I'm so here for it. - I'm here for it too. I'm a big fan. I'm a big fan of who you are, I'm a big fan of everything you do, of putting yourself out there, putting your love out there in terms of the designs you create.

  "full_text": "- It's a machine, it was my friend Daniel\nBeauchamp and I, we had this long running joke\nabout a proud parent machine that you could give a quarter, and it pats you on the shoulder,\nand says, \"Proud of you.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So yeah, I still have\nthat hanging on my wall in my workshop. So that one, I'm really happy with. I just think it's a really funny concept, and also I executed the build well. - [Lex] So it's an arm? - [Simone] Hm-mm. - [Lex] What's the build? - [Simone] I built it\noff of an old lamp arm. Yeah, basically, it's\njust a motorized arm, and this kind of torso of a person. - [Lex] Was this, so it's\nactually a hand, right? - [Simone] It's just laser cut plywood, and it kinda has like, it looks creepy. - [Lex] Yeah. - And yeah, it's says \"Proud of you, son.\" Because I just thought\nthat sounded more funny than \"Proud of you, daughter,\" and also, \"Proud of you, son,\" just, it immediately communicates\nthat it's a parent. It's not just like a\ncolleague or something. He's like, \"Proud of you.\" - (laughs) Yeah. - [Simone] And it charges\nyou a quarter for it. - Yeah, but you add like\nChatGPT on top of that, and fine tune it on\nconversations you've had with your parents, and all of a sudden, you have a thing that can fundamentally transform your psyche. - [Simone] Yeah. - The following is a conversation with Simone Giertz, and an\ninventor, designer, engineer, and roboticist famous for\na combination of humor and brilliant creative\ndesign in the systems and products she creates, including, as part of her new product\ndesign company called Yetch, she has a popular YouTube channel, where she has demonstrated\na lot of her incredible and fun designs and inventions\nfrom quote, \"shitty robots,\" to a Tesla Model 3 converted into a truck, but where she also revealed\nher personal journey, after having been diagnosed\nwith a brain tumor. Simone is a brilliant, fun,\nand inspiring human being. It was truly an honor for\nme to get to meet her, and to have this chat. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Simone Giertz. What was the first cool thing you built, where you fell in love with\nthe process of making stuff? - You know, I think, in the\nbeginning of building stuff, you run into the limitations\nof your skills so much. So I feel like honestly, building gets less and less frustrating, or I love it more and\nmore, the more I know. - So all the limitations aren't fun? Like when it's-\n- The limitations are fun, but it's like when you\nhave an idea of something and you wanna make it a certain level, and then you just have to compromise with the materials and the\ntools and the skills you have. So I can't remember first\ntime where I felt like- - [Lex] I'm proud of this. - Wow, this was so smooth,\nI'm so proud of it. I feel like a lot of people,\nI watch them build stuff, and it's just like\nwatching water pour down, it's just so easy, and for me, it's just like trying to\nshove a toy car into a wall. - So you're not able\nto step back and marvel at the early creations, even like, we're not even talking the\nArduino stuff, even before then. - I'm from Sweden, and you\nhave to choose either sewing or woodworking, and I chose\nwoodworking in middle school, and I remember the sense\nof pride when I got to bring something home\nand that thing of like, oh my God, I get to show my parents this. And I think that is kind of\nthe feeling that I've built my job around. It's the sense of pride, and wanting to show people\nsomething that I made, and back then, it was a\nlittle wooden spoon, and now, it's a slightly larger wooden spoon. - Wood spoon. Yeah. That is dynamic, and moves,\nand has a mind of its own. You first started doing\nmore engineering type-stuff with Arduino boards at Punch Through Design, which\nis an SF engineering firm. What are, just from your memory there, what are some cool things you built there? - So the thing is, I went\nto advertising school, and I just, like a\nvocational study's a year, and I realized there\nthat I didn't care much for advertising, but I\nthought it was really fun to build stuff and program, so I just completely focused on that, and there I built my\nfirst hardware project or electronics project,\nwhich was this iPhone case with retractable guitar strings. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - So basically, I imagined\nthat you could pull out guitar strings from\nthe bottom of your iPhone, and you could pluck it to your belt, and then you could hold\na chord on the screen. And I built that together\nwith my friend Jonathan. And I was like, oh, this is dope. I thought it was so much\nfun, and I considered, oh, should I go to school for this? But then I thought, hmm,\nmaybe I can get a job, and I could get paid to\nlearn about electronics. So, just based off of that one project, I got the job at Punch Through\nDesign, where actually, it was a one-year internship. - Can you explain what\nwe're talking about here? So it's a case. - [Simone] Hm-mm. - With guitar strings attached to it. - [Simone] Yeah. - Does it actually work at all? - It does. - These are not on the\nscreen guitar strings? - No, so they're actual\nstrings that you pull out. So there's a mechanism that's almost like a seatbelt mechanism\nand, yeah, you pull them out from the bottom of your phone, and you can attach them to your belt. I mean, it's terrible. There's a few different ways to decide if somebody's touching a guitar string. And what you do in a real\nguitar is, you have the little, it's like measuring the\nvibration or the change in the, yeah, you're measuring how\nthe guitar is vibrating, and you can't really do that, because I can't have a receiving sensor, because the guitar strings are gonna move in relationship to that\nbecause you don't have this rigid neck. And this is, yeah, this was\nmy first electronics project. I was a little fledging baby maker, but what I decided was\nto use capacitive touch, 'cause that is independent\non if the guitar strings are moving in relationship to something, or in relation to something. So basically, there was just this little Bluetooth Arduino board that this company, Punched Through Design made,\nso that was how I found them. And I measured the capacitive touch. So like whenever the\nguitar string was measured, there was this little\nmicrocontroller that was like, oh my god, a guitar string\ngot measured, or it touched, and then that sent a signal\nover Bluetooth to my phone, and I'd built a little\niPhone app that interpreted those Bluetooth signals,\nand then checked what type of chord I was holding on the screen, and then played the coherent sound. - So you holding the chords on the screen. - So you're doing the\nmulti-touch sensing there. - [Simone] Hm-mm. - That's incredible. - I honestly cannot believe\nthat I pulled it off, because I think I was,\nignorance was definitely bliss, because that was like, yeah, the first hardware project I'd ever built, the first iPhone app I'd ever programmed. And now, if somebody was like, \"Hey, I want this to be my first project,\" I would probably be\nlike, \"Oh, that's a lot,\" but I pulled it off. - That's such an interesting\nthing for people to hear, because it's your first project, and a lot of people stop\nbecause of the difficulty of their first project. They never truly discover\ntheir own genius, because they stop at the\nfirst, and you didn't stop. So it'd be interesting\nto kind of psychoanalyze you on the couch, of why you didn't stop. 'Cause you have to build an app. - [Simone] Yeah. - To figure out how to, did you know how to program much, or no? - [Simone] No. - Okay.\n- I mean a little bit, but I never programmed\nin or done any iOS apps. - Okay, so you have to\nfigure out how to get, forget what the app does, just get the app running and\nworking and then you have to figure out how to get\nthe sensors in real time, the finger touching,\nand you have to connect how to get the capacitor touch working with the microcontrollers. Do you know anything about\nthe capacitor touch sensors at that time? - No, I mean, it's pretty easy now. It's basically-\n- Everything's easy. You know, rockets are pretty easy. - Hey, you sound like my grandma. She's like, I have an Italian grandma, and I'm always trying to get her, we're trying to get\nher to tell her recipes and every recipe starts\nwith, \"It's very simple.\" And then there's 45 minutes of\nher explaining it. (laughing) - It's like with gymnastics\nat the Olympics, they make it look easy. The best people in the world always make the impossible seem easy. - I pride myself with making\nbuildings look really hard, 'cause I feel like I'm\nalways struggling so much. - [Lex] You make the easy seem impossible. - Yeah, yes. - [Lex] No. So how many strings was it? Was it just one? - Oh gosh, I mean this\nis such a long time ago. No, it was six. - Six strings, and you could\ntouch it, and then there's, wow, and it can, and then the\nphone itself makes a sound? - Uh-huh, and I still think\nit's such a cool concept to have this mobile, I'm\nnot even a guitar player. I don't know, I mean I got\nthe idea because I was kind of strumming on my\ncharge cord of my phone. - Oh, like an air guitar, but on a cord? - Yeah, but I've been thinking\nabout it 'cause I'm like, oh man, it would be really fun to go back to that project with what I know now, but the problem with it is\nthat when you're producing the tension in your\nstring just with your arm, you can't make it taut\nenough to actually play. It kinda becomes playing\nthese saggy strings. - [Lex] Yep. - So as you're not really\ngetting that experience. And I think that's why, I mean I, yeah. I haven't really pursued it. I wonder if there's a way\nto generate the tightness from the case itself, get a\ndevice that unfolds, and then, with some kind of tightening mechanisms. - Yeah, but then it kind of\nbecomes this whole thing- - [Lex] A guitar. - A guitar, then it just\nbecomes a really shitty guitar. - [Lex] Yeah. - Which, this is a really shitty guitar, but it's also not a guitar. - But it's so shitty, It's awesome. - Yeah, I don't know.\n- But it's cool that you have an interface between a device that's capable of incredible computational power, and an actual hardware thing. Is there something that\nyou can psychoanalyze that made you finish, that others could hear in\ntheir own struggle to do their first project like that? Because you were a non-engineering\nperson, technically, and you did a pretty cool\nrenegade, out-there, wild, no-instructions engineering project. - No, it definitely was an off-road build, where it's like if you're\nbuilding a Lego kit, it's very much on the road, and you're following\ninstructions and this is like, you have no idea if\nyou're headed for a cliff or a dead end, or you're gonna get stuck. I think it had a natural pressure to it, because it was a school project. - [Lex] Yeah. - So, it did have deadlines built into it, and stuff like that, so\nthat definitely helped. But I think also, it was just so incredibly\nmotivating when I realized that I might be able to pull it off. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like that was, I felt like a bloodhound, you're just like, \"Oh my God, I can actually make this happen.\" And I think if I hadn't\nseen that at the horizon, it would've been harder to stick through. - Were you able to see\nthe end of the tunnel pretty early on? - No, not really. (laughs) - So there's something to\njust suffering for a while. - I don't know how your\nbrain works, but it's like, if I have a problem, I can't\nstop thinking about it. It's so fun to think about it. I spent two and a half years\ndesigning a coat hanger, and I just can't stop thinking about it. I get so into it, 'cause\nI think it's so much fun. - Take me to this two-year\njourney of the coat hanger. - (laughing) The coat hanger. - [Lex] How did it begin? - How did it begin? It began with a corner in\nmy home where I couldn't fit a coat rack. The thing is, I shouldn't\nhave brought this up, because I'm gonna release it as a product, probably in a year. - Oh, an actual product.\n- Mm-hm. - Okay, well let's view it as a mystery. - [Simone] It's a mystery, yeah. - It's what it is, it solves a fundamental\nproblem in the human condition. - Yes, and I am so excited\nabout it, and I cannot, I don't think, yeah, but this\nis, I get so pumped about it, because I see, it's just this issue, or this problem that I wanna solve, and I can't put it to rest until I have. - Speaking of coat hangers, doorknobs have always\nbeen interesting to me. Is cool how there's\nthings that everybody uses that somebody designed. - [Simone] Lex. - Yeah? - Oh my God, so, okay, so\nthis is, so I have two big, so basically, I started on\nYouTube, and I have been doing that for the last\nseven or eight years. And I've been thinking of,\nokay, what's next for me? 'Cause I wanna keep on\ntrying out new things. And I'm kind of going into\ntwo different avenues. One is the product\nbusiness that I started, coat hanger is TBD, and then I am working on a pilot episode of a show, where each episode is\nabout an everyday object, and why they look the way that they do. So we've written a pilot\nepisode about forks, and it's all about, why do\nthey look the way that they do? - [Lex] That's awesome. - Why did this became the\neating implement of the West? Why are we ruled by an iron\nfork? How did that happen? And everyday object that you have, and that you just take for granted, somebody's just made it up. - Yeah, we're all sheep.\nWe all keep using it. - [Simone] Yeah. - Even if it's not, I mean, presumably most objects\nare optimal, you hope, or at least-\n- But they're not, yeah. And that's what I think is\nso like the world around us, and this is why I love building things, is because it just opens up this idea that the world around us is so malleable, and you can make objects\nwork for you better. I spent, I made this fruit\nbowl, I had a fruit bowl, and I was always annoyed\nthat I had either too little or too much fruit for it. So I made a fruit bowl where\nI can change the diameter of it, has a mechanism so you\ncan make it bigger or smaller. And that's just the thing\nof being like bowls. Why are they the way that they are? I can make them different. And I think like I wanna make\nan episode about doorknobs. I think it's so interesting,\nwhy are they the way they are? Why are they placed\nthe way where they are? - I think that's gonna be a rabbit hole from which you'll never return. - I would happily live in\nthat rabbit hole forever. Like if I can like dig out a\nlittle niche for myself there, because I think it's like... They go so deep. - They're also on\ndifferent sides of doors. You never, like the push/pull\nsituation on doors in general? That's one of the main\nproblems of humanity is figuring out-\n- Push/pull doors? (laughs) - [Lex] Figuring out which- - Is embarrassing, yeah. - Okay, how many, there's\n8 billion people on Earth. Every single second, there\nis millions of people being embarrassed by the confusion... - Real life stats. - Right now there's somebody, some guy, first time in college, he's trying to be impressive\nto everybody, he pushes on it, and he plays it off like it's\ncool, oh, shit, I knew that, over and over. - And it affects our behaviors. That was why I think it's\nso interesting with forks, is that forks actually\naffect our eating behaviors, and they can get you to\neat faster or slower, take bigger bites or smaller bites. And they're all these\nways, or like the social, I mean the reason that chopsticks work is because they do the food\nchopping in the kitchen, rather than on the plate. And also you have a bowl\nthat you bring to your mouth, whereas a plate you keep on the, there are just all these ways in which these objects\naffect our behavior, opening and closing doors. And I think it's such an\ninteresting take on culture, and human behavior, through these objects that we use every day, and we\nnever question them really. - Yeah, and then there's\ninstitutions that are controlling our mind that don't\nwant us to know the truth. Why are sporks not more popular? Have you asked yourself that question? - Yeah, no, it's all Big\nUtensil is behind all of it. (both laughing) - All right, so, in those early days, did you suffer from imposter syndrome? That leap to being an engineer? Was there, especially when\nyou started working on parts of the design on a team of\nengineers, was there insecurity? - Both yes and no. I think I always try to\nflip my flaws into selling points and for that, so\ngetting that job, I was like, oh, you're a team of engineers. Everybody working here is an engineer. Your customers are not all engineers. You need somebody who can\nbe your filter and tell you when something's gonna be too hard for your customers to understand. So it was more me being like, oh no, it might seem that me not\nhaving skills is a bad thing, but actually, it's a\ngreat thing, you need it. - I represent the everyday person. I understand deeply what\neverybody needs and wants. - Yes, that is me, the\nrepresentation of the average human. But I mean, I remember that, so I studied physics for\na year in college and then I dropped out, and I had\nthis rule for myself, that whenever I did not\nunderstand something, I would ask a question. So I was always raising my hand in class, and it's this room, entire auditorium, filled with incredibly intelligent people who are mortified of seeming stupid. And I think that was really, and I remember people at the\nend of the year coming up to me and being like, \"Thank you so much for all\nthe questions you asked, because whenever there was\nsomething that I was too scared to ask, you\nalways raised your hand.\" So I think it is a bit of a skill, and I think that is kind of how I channel my imposter syndrome is, I'm just like, no, let's lay it all out there. (laughs) - So you're okay being\nalmost self-deprecating, just coming off, I mean,\nI'm definitely that, I kind of lean into it,\nI call myself an idiot. I lean into being stupid. I\nthink not all heroes wear capes. And the guy and girl who\nasks the stupid question is everybody's hero. Including the poor teachers. - Yeah, I think it's both.\nIt's a double-edged sword. I started out on the internet,\nI kind of got the moniker, the Queen of Shitty Robots\nbecause I posted a lot of stuff on /r/shittyrobots\non Reddit, and people started calling me the\nQueen of /r/shittyrobots, and then, the /r kind of dropped. So what I'm trying to say is, I did not come up with that myself, but I did happily adopt it. So I definitely came from\na place of like building things that didn't\nwork, and kind of, yeah, everything going wrong every time. Like happily failing. And\nI think that was amazing. It was a really powerful\ntool for me to not get my perfectionism in the way, because if I set out to\ndo something that's great, then I'm never gonna start. And I was like, no, I just need\nsomething that looks funny. But what I've realized\nnow is that it was also a defense mechanism. Being self-deprecating\nis always beating people to the punch. It kind of was a survival\ntactic on the internet, of being never daring\nto set out as an expert. And I still do that, I'm terrified to tell\npeople how to do something, even if I know, because it opens\nyou up for being shot down, so I think I definitely have a conflicted relationship with it. And now especially, as I'm getting older, I am more skilled than I was before, I mean I'm a CEO of three\nbusinesses, and I'm like, I don't need to keep on talking\nmyself down all the time. So yeah, I think it's\ndefinitely something that has served me really, really well, and that is still a thing\nthat I have in my work life and in my relationships, but I'm also trying to only\ndo it when it's beneficial to me and not when it's harmful. - Yeah, but when you're\nas successful as you are, I feel like people like it when you're self-deprecating and you don't take yourself seriously. You have that humility.\n- Yeah. - I think it's probably the hardest when you're starting out. - Yeah? No, I think it\nwas easier then, almost. I dunno. - But nobody takes you seriously, right? When you're starting\nout, when you're young. - You know, I just realized\nthat I played a lot more stupid than I was. And I think it's also, oh gosh, I can't believe I'm\nthe one bringing this up, but being a woman in a\nmale-dominated field, and you're like, I was\njust trying to make myself the least amount threatening\nor really unthreatening, because people are threatened\nby you in different ways, and it's like, you have such\na thin line that you can walk where you're like, okay, I need to be just attractive\nenough for people to not be offended by my appearance, but just unattractive enough for people to not sexualize me. I have to be just smart\nand witty enough for people to be like, \"Oh my god,\nthat's really cool.\" But also shoot myself down\nenough for other people not to be able to do it or be like, oh yeah, watch this woman try, thinking that she knows\nhow to build electronics. So it's like... - That's an interesting skill to build, especially when you put yourself\nout there on the internet. - [Simone] Yeah. - Unfortunately, that's the\nreality of the internet, and it's a skill you have to develop, and it's actually why a\nlot of really brilliant people avoid the internet. - [Simone] Yeah. - There's not many people,\nlike at MIT for example, there's not many brilliant\nprofessors or PhD students and so on, just putting\ntheir stuff out there, because if they really put their heart and soul into a thing, first of\nall, that's really hard, and nobody sees it, and\nthen everyone's like, \"Eh, this is boring.\" So there's so many failure\nmodes like, \"This is boring.\" Or, like, like you said, you're coming off as\ntoo much of an expert, you're not self-deprecating enough or there's just so many failure modes and it's terrifying for people. But I feel like that's a\nskill you should learn, because most people, like at\nMIT, at university, and so on, are doing a lot of awesome stuff. - [Simone] Yeah. - And they should show it off. But I feel like you figured out a really good\nprocess of showing it off, of when you fail, when\nyou succeed, all of it. Not taking yourself too seriously, but also revealing through the humor and the self-deprecation a kind of genius, a kind of intelligence and curiosity. - Okay, I just wanna snapshot that quote, and put it on my LinkedIn,\nand the back of my book. - [Lex] When is your\nautobiography coming out? - Oh, never. (laughs) - You don't wanna say that,\nbecause a year from now. - Oh God, I don't wanna\nshit on autobiographies. - Yeah.\n- No. But even, just by saying that, I'm on shitting on autobiographies. I just, me being interested\nenough in somebody to wanna read 600 pages about them talking about themselves, it's a... - No, well, (laughing) that's\nexactly the kind of person that should write one. - But also I'm fucking 32 years old, what do I have to write about? I went through puberty,\nI lost my virginity, and here we are, I dunno,\nit's such a... (laughs) - Three chapters, it's a\ncoloring book (laughing). - Chapter seven, I learn\nto tie my own shoelaces. - I feel like it would be\nawesome. Anyway, what's the Queen? So how did you achieve\nthe status of royalty? The Queen of Shitty Robots?\nWhat's the origin story there? - I have officially\nrenounced my title now. - Can you still speak\nof the time when you- - I can still speak of the time. - [Lex] Your kingdom? - Yes. No, I mean it started on because I- - Did you rule by love or fear? - By fear of rejection, from me, that people would reject me. So I, yeah, I started\nmaking these little gifs. The early projects that I\ndid were very gif-forward. It was always like, I only did it because they\ncould be translated into a gif. - Gif-forward. I like it. - Yeah, but honestly it was like, it's a really good mental exercise, to vet if your project is\neasy enough to be explained by a seven-second looping\nvideo without audio, and because nobody's gonna care\nthat it also has Bluetooth. It's really like, is it\nself-explanatory enough to be explained through a gif, so yeah. - Could I just pause, I'm\nsorry to interrupt but- - [Simone] No, go for it. - I feel like all scientific\npapers and projects should go through that exercise. - Can it be explained as a gif? - Yeah, actually, Deepmind\ndoes a good job of this. Like, we saw a protein\nfolding, here's a gif, that's literally what they do. - [Simone] Yeah. - Because who's gonna\nread the Nature paper? So, you have to like, how do\nwe communicate this visually, in a sexy, clean way, where people can intuitively understand, even if you don't know what a protein is, even if you don't know what\nprotein folding is, yeah. It's a cool exercise. - No, it's very like, yeah, if somebody comes outta context, and that's been really interesting, also, building this product\nbusiness and trying to do the marketing around that. And I'm like, if somebody comes in, and they have no idea\nabout what this product is, will they get it explained\nto them in this ad? And I don't know, but it's definitely a\nworthwhile exercise to do. So I started making\nthese projects that got translated into gifs, and I posted them on /r/shittyrobots on Reddit. - So that subReddit existed? - Yeah, and I loved it. I thought it was really\nfun and I was like, I wanna contribute with content here. - [Lex] Conquer it. - I don't, I mean, I don't know. I was voted, I think I was\nvoted top user of 2015. So yeah, that's an old merit. - Once you win a Nobel\nPrize, you always have the Nobel Prize.\n- (laughing) Yeah. - Okay, so what was the first, do you remember the early\ngifs that you created? - So this is when I was at Punch Through Design in\nSan Francisco, I was building a lot of hardware projects for them. But I also felt, and they\nwere so supportive of me, but I also, it's such a different way, representing a brand versus\nrepresenting yourself. So there were some projects\nthat I just ruled out, 'cause I was like, this feels\ntoo weird for this brand. And I started building them on the side. One of them was a\ntoothbrush helmet, and yeah, so it's like a skateboard\nhelmet with a robot arm on the forehead, kind\nof like a unicorn horn, and it brushes your teeth for you. - Was that the first\nYouTube video you uploaded? - It was the first gif that I uploaded. So actually, I wanted to... I wanted to do a kids'\nshow about electronics in Sweden, 'cause I was\nlike, I love electronics, I think it's fucking dope. I could do a kids' show about it. So I filmed this terrible,\nterrible pilot episode in my bedroom in San Francisco, and that's when I built the toothbrush helmet\nand I emailed it to them, I mean just cold email,\nI had no in or anything, but I was like, \"Hey, I wanna do this,\" and they didn't get back\nto me, nobody surprised, and I was like, well I\nhave this thing I built, I might as well post it on the internet. So that's why I made the little gif, and I posted it on /r/shittyrobots. I think it got like 50,000\nviews, and I was like, wow. And from there, I just\nkept on building things, and I think within six months,\nit was my full-time job. - Can you go through the detailed design of this toothbrush helmet? So it's a motor, it's like\na servo, what's the motor? Is an Arduino involved? - Yeah. So I built it off of\nthis robot arm called MeArm. So it's just this acrylic robot arm, and I think it has three servomotors, and it's all controlled by an\nArduino, all the electronics. - The arm's already prebuilt? - It was a kit, so I assembled it. - How do you make sure the\nlength of the arm is the proper? - I mean the arm came down so it's like, I mean I just programmed it\nto come down to my mouth, and then poorly brush my front teeth. - Yeah. - [Simone] Yeah. - And it was just swung\nback and forth, I mean... - Trial and error, is how I did that. - What was the challenges\nof that, do you remember? - [Simone] Oh gosh. - Or was that one not much of a struggle? - No, it was definitely a struggle. - [Lex] Because also, how do\nyou loop it with a nice gif? - I mean, it loops. It loops fine. - Yeah, it loops pretty\nfine. That's not that hard? - No, I mean it doesn't\nhave to be perfect. It's a gif, it's the internet. Things are shitty all the time. I think the biggest struggle\nof that was that I had this intention for it to be the show, and then them not giving back. And I was like, well,\nif they don't want it, then maybe YouTube will have me. - They don't notice my genius yet. - [Simone] Yep. - What was so bad about\nthe pilot, do you remember? What's the most embarrassing? - It's so cringey. Yeah, I mean it's thankfully\nnot on the internet, so nobody can find it. But it's very much me being\nin what I called host mode, which is where I'm like, \"Okay, so what we're\ngonna learn today is that, we're gonna look at this is\nsomething called a servomotor,\" and the intonation and\neverything is really different. And I'm actually, I mean\nthinking back on that, I'm so happy that they\ndidn't get back to me, because it's such a\ndifferent thing to start your career in your living room, running back and forth\nto the camera and filming something and then looking at it, and I got to really find my\nown voice in a different way. And then a year later,\nthey offered me a show, but then I was so off\nand running, I was like, no, I don't wanna do this. - You didn't fall into that\nplace of being a actor, like a YouTuber, where you're presenting\na kind of personality. You're more focused on the\nproduct you're creating. - I mean, I think it's\na combination of it. I think of it as acting sometimes, but I only play the role of myself. But of course it's like when\nyou're shooting something for the seventh time, like you have to be able\nto muster that enthusiasm. But no, it's not a kind of, think of everyday life me\nas a watered-down version of the YouTube version. It's like-\n- It's a cheap knockoff? - Yeah, (laughing) the wish.com version. No, it's just like, add a few\nparts water, and you have me. But on YouTube, it's just so condensed, 'cause you have jump cuts, and yeah, I'll script jokes and make\nsure that everything lands, and there's music and stuff,\nand then in real life, you don't have any of that. But it's still me. - What are some other cool\nrobots in the early days that stand out to you? I mean there's a million we\ncan go through, but what, maybe, what was a challenging one? Like a really challenging\none, in the early days? - I mean I remember the breakfast robot, which was my second project,\nwas a challenging one, so... - Was it eating cereal? - Yeah, it's a robot that\npours milk and cereal, and feeds me with a spoon. It was mostly challenging\nbecause it was so, everything had to be\nin the right location, and there were so many takes\nbefore I got everything right. And by right, I mean it\nmakes an absolute mess. Yeah, that one was challenging. - [Lex] How many takes was that one? - I don't know, probably 12, 10 something. - [Lex] Just a mess everywhere. - It was a mess, and also, I\nused Cheerios for the cereals, and it's shot in my old bedroom in San Francisco, and\nthe floors were sticky for weeks afterwards. - See, this could go\ninto your autobiography. - [Simone] (laughing) Yeah. - It's nice. - We can just type out this podcast. - [Lex] Make a transcript. - And I'll release it, my\nmanager would be stoked. - We'll fix it in post. Yeah, the feed, 'cause you have a couple\nof feeding ones, right? There's soup, isn't there a soup one? - Yeah, there's a soup robot.\nThere's a beer-pouring robot. - I mean, that's awesome. That's a difficult robotics problem, in the shitty and the perfect version, of having an arm that interacts intimately with a human being. And one of the most\nintimate things you can do with a human being\nthat's PG is to feed it. - That's what I was thinking,\n(laughing) don't go there. - [Lex] Where is he going with this? - Oh my God, he's a YouTube\ncomic come live. Like, dammit. - So, to me there's a, feeding is tricky, or even like getting a beer,\neven pouring a beer, is tough, into a glass.\n- Yeah, it's trickier than anyone\nwho hasn't tried it thinks. And even making it, I think what I realized\nis that making things really shitty, or failing\nin a spectacular way is also its own sort of skill, because, the shittiest robot is the\none that doesn't turn on, but that isn't much to watch. So it was always wanting\nfor it to fail in these kind of spectacular ways. No, there's a lot of stuff to be said about engineering in it. - Is there something to\nbe said on a philosophical level about the value of a flawed robot? So like... The kind of robots you want\nis to be partially flawed? Do you think the kind of\nrobots we'll have in the home, that are friends and, you\nknow, almost like pets, wouldn't they need to be kind of shitty, because we can love, somehow\nwe humans love the shitty. - I mean it's kind of endearing, and 'cause I think it kind of, I'm gonna mess up this word,\nanthropomorphizes them. I mean, I never feel as deeply connected to my Roomba as when it's\nlike, \"I'm on a cliff.\" I'm like... - Have you had Roombas talk-\n- This tiny ledge. - No.\n- I really, yeah, I've done that a lot. - Yeah?\n- When they talk to you. Yeah. And you immediately anthropomorphize them. - Yeah. - [Simone] And then you\nhave, if they have a name, which is why most\nroboticists don't give names or gender to robots. 'Cause you become connected to them. I'm of the opposite mind. You should have like, an intimate\nrelationship sounds weird, but you should have a\nclose connection to robots. I mean there's power in that. There's a social element\nof robotics, even an arm. I don't know, there's\nsomething about us humans that gains so much value\nfrom our interaction with dynamic objects\nand we should like lean into that as opposed to run away from it. That was always the confusing thing to me about robotics is that most\nroboticists run away from that. - Yeah.\n- It's weird, 'cause it's obviously gonna be, robots are obviously gonna be everywhere. - Yeah.\n- Obviously. - But it's also humans\nare sensitive and squishy and there's so much liability. - Oh.\n- Yeah. - Yeah. But humans are sensitive and squishy when they interact with\neach other and they hurt each other all the time. Like sometimes they get\ntogether and they're like, oh you're the best, no you're the best. And then they leave each\nother and then they break each other's heart. - Sorry about your breakup, Lex. - Yeah, I'm just trying to get over this. I'm actually drunk for this interview. (laughs) Haven't been able to sleep- - Have you slept all night? - But from a safety protocol perspective, people think about like physical damage, not emotional damage. I know this sounds ridiculous, I know this sounds\nridiculous, but it won't be. It's already happening. There's an app called\nReplica where people have an intimate relationship\nwith an AI chat bot and they hurt themselves. - I was thinking about this. - Yeah.\n- Okay. In dating... What if you, 'cause you\ncan drain like a chat bot to kinda mimic the way\nthat you talk to people and interact with people. - Go on.\n- Yeah. But then I'm like, okay, but what if we could all\nmake AI versions of ourselves and have them date... - Yeah.\n- Like thousands of thousands of other AI people and have that as a way to\nturn out potential candidates. Like I feel like that's\ngonna be, what's the... Yeah. - What's the, what?\n- No, but what's the point of\nlike meeting 20 people if you're like, oh, but if we just had our AI\nversions of ourselves interact, they'd be like, oh, your method of conflict\nis not gonna match. Or... - What if the AI version\nof you like sleeps around with all the other AI\nand it becomes famous for that and it starts\nthis on OnlyFans and then it become, and you're\nlike, what did you do? You come back home you'd\nrealize like, I don't, I didn't want any, I... - Created a monster?\n- Created a monster. - I mean, do I get a cut? - Exactly. That's the\nquestion I'd be asking. - But I think it's definitely like, yeah the human technology interaction is really interesting because\nI feel like I don't love any of the machines\nthat I have in my life. - [Lex] Oh really? You haven't... - I mean, I don't love my phone. I touch it all the time and it's there and it's like constantly, it's a constant presence, but there's nothing than\nme that feels like, oh, I love this object. Like I kind of despise it. - Well, that might be the way\nyou show love. I don't know. Yeah. That's a deeper, that's\nanother psychoanalysis thing. So you don't, there's not\nrobots whom you've taken apart that you miss? - No, they're all terrible. I mean I have objects\nthat I built that I love, none of the robots I think. But that's also because\nthere was a different, that was a different era\nwhere I wasn't really putting a lot of care into the projects I built. - So the more care you put into it, into the design to actually make it look, to make it functional and look good, that's where you put the love in. - Yeah. I mean it is, it's like I feel like\nany technology company that figures out a way\nto get you to actually genuinely love your Roomba\nor like love it in the way that you would love a pet\nhas a lot to be gained. - Yeah. And I think it's scary,\ndepending on who the company is, because then they can manipulate you. - Yeah.\n- If you love your Roomba and all of a sudden your Roomba starts telling\nyou to buy stuff... - Yeah.\n- Or it's leaving. - To put lotion on Jeff Bezos's head. - Yeah. I don't know where\nthe lotion came in, but yes. Maybe buy certain-\n- I just... I just imagine my Amazon\nEcho being like, \"Hey...\" - Hey.\n- Jeff Bezos, he is really a great guy. - (laughs) But even though you haven't, do you think it's possible\nto fall in love with a robot? - Yeah. I mean people fall in\nlove with things all the time. - Well people have fallen in love with your shitty robots, probably. I guarantee you there's people listening to this that are a little\nbit heartbroken saying that you've never fallen in\nlove with your shitty robot. They're like, but I had a relationship. Like I have an emotional\nconnection to that robot. Like the one with a parent,\npats you on the back. - Oh, that one. That one I do like. I like that one a lot. That's probably my favorite,\nlike, shitty robot. - Can you explain it?\n- So it's a machine, it was my friend Daniel\nBeauchamp and I, we had this long running joke\nabout a proud parent machine that you could give a quarter, and it pats you on the shoulder,\nand says, \"Proud of you.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So yeah, I still have\nthat hanging on my wall in my workshop. So that one, I'm really happy with. I just think it's a really funny concept, and also I executed the build well. - So it's an arm?\n- Hm-mm. - What's the build? - I built it off of an old lamp arm. Yeah, basically, it's\njust a motorized arm, and this torso of a person. - Was this, so it's\nactually a hand, right? - It's just laser cut plywood,\nand it kinda has like, it looks creepy. - Yeah.\n- Which I like. - Yeah. The creepy helps with the... - And yeah, it's says \"Proud of you, son.\" Because I just thought\nthat sounded more funny than \"Proud of you, daughter,\" and also, \"Proud of you, son,\" just, it immediately communicates\nthat it's a parent. It's not just like a\ncolleague or something. He's like, \"Proud of you.\" - (laughs) Yeah. - [Simone] And it charges\nyou a quarter for it. - Yeah, but you add like\nChatGPT on top of that, and fine tune it on\nconversations you've had with your parents, and all of a sudden, you have a thing that can fundamentally transform your psyche.\n- Yeah. - That's all it takes.\nThat's a beautiful creation. How'd you come up with that creation? - Oh it was my friend Daniel and I who had a long-running joke about it. - High level, can you speak\nto your creative process? - I think a lot of it,\nI mean it's changed... - [Lex] For the shitty\nrobots. That's actually- - For the shitty robot. Yeah. I mean it has a lot of overlap, so it's identifying everyday problems and in the shitty robot\nera I would kind of take an everyday problem like oh\nI have a hard time getting up in the morning and I would solve it in the most ridiculous, spectacular way I could think of. So if we're waking up in the morning, it was having an alarm clock that slaps me in the face with a rubber hand. And what I'm doing now\nis still identifying everyday problems, but I'm actually trying to like product design my way out of it. - What in your experience\nwas the funniest thing? Is it violence? Like\nthe hand slapping you? Food eating? Is there is, or\nis it just case dependent? - I think the funniest is... No, I think it's more like\nthe proud parent machine. It's not violent. It doesn't,\nyeah, there's no nothing. It's just emotional and\nit's kind of a commentary on this fraught relationship\nthat we sometimes have with our parents and they're proud of us. - Sometimes? Every time.\n- Sometimes. My dad visited like last\nweek and he was like, \"I just wanna say I'm so\nproud of you and for the life you've built for yourself.\" And that was really sweet.\n- Yeah. Really good. - I'll put that on the back\nof my autobiography too. - Yeah, it's not your fault,\nSimone. It's not your fault. - Some stuff is my fault. - What was the longest one to complete for the shitty robots that you remember? 'Cause you spent on a few of them, you spent quite a long time. - [Simone] Mm-hm. - Which is also inspiring\nwhen you take so long on a project. - Yeah, I think kind\nof in the more like fun whimsical department\nrather than shitty robots. I built recently this music box. So like a small music box\nthat kind of has a barrel with little spikes and it plays a song. But I did a large version\nof that that pops a sheet of bubble wrap and then like\nplays tones into a pan flute. So yeah, you can actually program it to play different songs. That one kicked my butt\nin so many creative ways and it was such a pain. I think that is probably\nthe like weird funny project that's taken\nme the longest and like the biggest engineering effort. - [Lex] Where's the sound coming from? - So if you, it all came from me realizing\nthat if you pop bubble wrap and you pop it right\nin front of the opening of a pan flute or like one\nof the pipes you can have it play different tones. So that's what it does. So I built this music\ninstrument off of that. - Okay. If it's okay, can you\ndescribe some something like how it works, some of the\ntechnical details here? - Yeah.\n- It's fascinating. - So basically, I mean one\nof the big issues that I had, so I worked with as of\na year and a half back, I hired an engineer, Stu, So we were collaborating on it. But a big issue that we had\nwas feeding in the bubble wrap sheet and like\nmaking sure that it feeds in straight and doesn't\nget skewed because you need to make like the popping feet, which is where you\nprogram this barrel to pop different bubbles need to\nbe so perfectly aligned on the bubble of the\nbubble wrap for it to pop in the right location. - So there's a feeder for the bubble wrap. That's a challenge. And then you have to have\na barrel with the little baby feet on it.\n- Yeah. - That pops the bubble\nwrap. Why is it so exciting? - That barrel was a pain. - Yeah.\n- As well. I had to get a, like this rotary set\nup for my CNC and yeah, it was a lot of work, but that was really\nfun and it's just like, this is probably my\nfavorite privilege of my job is that I can go down any rabbit hole I think find interesting. - Did you have a lot of\njoy from popping the... - Yeah. That's-\n- The bubbles. - That's a lot of self soothing,\nand like I got to spend, I think I spent a week trying to figure out the best material\nto pop bubble wrap with, because if you have two, if you kind of put them\ntwo through or through, if you put a sheet of bubble\nwrap through two rigid tubes, the air kind of just escapes from one side of the bubble into the other. So what I realized was that if\nyou have a squishy material, like kind of a yoga mat\nmaterial in between it, it actually, it prevents that and pops\nit a lot more reliably. But like increasing the\npop reliability was a huge effort as well. - You have to pop a squishy thing with another squishy thing. - Because you don't need a lot of force. - Yeah.\n- Like you just need it to not, air to not be\nable to escape anywhere. - Wow.\n- But then also we had, there was different\nqualities of bubble wrap where there was a lot of transference between different bubbles. So instead of the bubble popping, it would just seep the air\ninto a neighboring bubble and that like membrane\nwould kind of, so, you know, I just, like getting\nto spend weeks on weeks of just studying bubble wrap. - Did you ever think about\nlike publishing academic work on bubble wrap? - No.\n- Wouldn't that be epic? 'Cause nobody's done this. I bet you nobody's done squishing, Squishy versus squishy for popping. - I bet somebody has. But you know, I always, I thought I was gonna go into academia. Like I was such an ambitious\nstudent. I loved school. I actually applied to\nMIT but then I pulled out 'cause I was like,\nno, I don't wanna do it. But now I realize it's\nreally good that I didn't because I'm too much of a spaz. - Too much of a spaz? Now I'm distracted. I'm thinking, there must be\npapers about when you have two bubbles, yeah. You need to know the\nphysics of two bubble, when you have two bubbles colliding, one will pop first and there\nhas to be good models of that. But that has to do with chemistry and whatever the material\nthe bubble was made from. But then, no, there's materials in here. Somebody must understand\nbubble wrap deeply. Like deeply. - So I'm just gonna take\na quick restroom break because Lex is on his own train now. And I'm just gonna leave\nyou to talk about bubble. Yeah. Actually don't need to go\nto the restroom. (laughs) - I'm gonna insert like a\ntwo hour instructional here with like a blackboard where I... - It's the skill of a podcaster. I feel like I could throw you any topic and you could just go on about it. - I don't know if I have\nthat skill. I just... I love bubble wrap. (laughs) Okay. - Bubble on bubble interaction. Go. - So you did mention\nMIT, you went to college for physics for one year\nand you dropped out. What do you learn from that? Who do you think should and\nshouldn't go to college? - Hmm. I think first of all,\nyou shouldn't listen to me. - That should be the name\nof your autobiography. - First of all, you\nshouldn't listen to me. I, you know, I realized that I was there for the wrong reasons. I had this deep, I got completely, like starting to get grades in school, which in Sweden at that\ntime we started getting it at 8th grade, so when I was 14, it just kind of hijacked my brain because I realized\nthat I could put a number on how smart I was and\nI got obsessed with it. And I wanted to study\nmechanical engineering because I was like, I like machines. But then physics was\nkind of the hardest thing you could do when I had\nthis like deep need to prove to myself that I was smart. So I started studying physics, realized I wasn't that smart. I realized, or I mean\njust mostly that I like, I love math but I don't\nlove math 10 hours a day. - [Lex] Yeah. - And also I think I am a\ngeneralist through and through. Like I'm decent at a\nfair amount of things, but definitely not a\nspecialist in any ways. And this, it was such a\nspecialist type of area that I felt like the other\nparts of my brain kind of just dwindled and died. So I think most of all, if people are thinking\nabout going to college and especially if you're here in the States and it's so\nfucking expensive, really... Okay, there's two things I wanna do. One is like actually go to\na workplace where people are doing the job that\nyou think you wanna do. If you wanna become a doctor, like be at a hospital and\nlike try to see how doctors work and if you actually like it, because I feel like\npeople have a lot of ideas of what it's gonna be\nlike and it just doesn't match with reality. And then I think when people\nfigure out what they wanna do, there's kind of, that's\ntwo separate questions or there's two questions that\nyou could split out of that. One is like what do you actually wanna do? That for me for the last\n10 years is building stuff. But then there's a second\npart to that question, which is what context\ndo you wanna do that? Do you wanna build stuff at a startup or at a big corporation? Do you wanna build\nstuff for an art gallery or for the movies or for YouTube? And I think that's often\nlike people only learn how to answer the first question, but then it's like the\ncontext means as much. Because I was building stuff at Punch Through Design\nand I wasn't getting that like deep fulfillment. Like I felt like I\nwasn't fully using myself and like hitting all of my gears because I just wasn't that\nmotivated about building stuff for other people. And I changed the context\nand everything changed. - And so sometimes you do\nneed to consider resume and stuff like that,\ndepending on the, but some, I think people consider that way too much, especially in modern times. I feel like you don't\nneed to go to college just for the resume. I feel like the biggest\nbenefit of college, I mean there's a bunch, but\none is just to do hard things. But you could do hard things anywhere. But some people need to be, I was probably one of those people, to be forced to do hard things. And the other is to\nmeet fascinating humans from all walks of life that are pursuing, that have all kinds of\ndifferent passions and allows you to learn, depending on the major, you can learn generally\nand you can search, if you're doing it efficiently, about what actually inspires you. And the other thing is the resume thing. - [Simone] Yeah. - But ultimately you\ndon't need college to find your passion to run with it. - I mean I have so much\ncollege FOMO though. Like I think it's, I chose a different set of experiences and when I applied to MIT I was, I think I was 24, 'cause I was like, oh, maybe I should become\nan electrical engineer because I really liked electronics. But then I remember seeing\nthat the average age was 18 and I was like, oh fuck\nno, I can't hang out, or like be in a room\nfilled with 18 year olds who are smarter than me.\n- Yeah. - So I think I definitely\nlike missed the train on having that experience. But at the same time I\ndid so many other things and I chose other experiences\nand I wouldn't trade them. But I still like, I mean I'll go to on a campus\nand I'll be like, oh... - [Lex] Yeah. - But I think it's also\nbecause I have a dreamy idea of what it is because I never had to do it and practice fully. - Exactly. It's the FOMO. - Yeah.\n- Huh. Yeah. A lot of people really\nstruggle with that burden. They'll go, it doesn't matter\nhow long you go through, if you don't go all the way to the PhD, a lot of people have the FOMO. It doesn't, it's a silly, silly, silly little notion I think\n'cause I think you should be doing college or school\nuntil you find something that lights your heart aflame,\nwhere you're like, fuck yes, I wanna do this. - Yeah.\n- And run with it. - I mean you can find that\nin other contexts as well. I've I found it.\n- Yeah. Exactly. - Yeah. But it is a buffet of\nexperiences that you can have. - What about what was the\nmost fun robot to make or musical artistic creation, where the process was the most fun? - Oh, they're all painful\nin different ways. - So pain.\n- Yeah. - Do you find pain fun?\n- No, but it definitely, the pride of me getting to pull something off or like\nmanaging to pull something off even when it was really\ndifficult is very satisfying. - What was the difficult\nthing that you pulled off? You were like, yeah, this is cool. - Mm... I like working on jigsaw puzzles, but I don't like how much\ntable space they take up because I like just have one\nbig table where I can do it. And that's also my dining table. So I made this mechanical\ntable where you can switch between two tabletops and that was an incredibly painful\nproject and I'm really happy with the outcome and like\nso proud that I managed to pull it off. - How does this switch tabletops? - It's tambour mechanism. So like tambour, like\nyou'll have on like old record player, like it's\nthese like thin slats of wood with fabric on\nthe back and you can kind of get them to go around curves. So basically one of the\ntabletops or table surfaces is tambour and then there's a little crank and you can kind of\nroll it off to the side and it reveals another\ntabletop under it that you can then lift up 'cause it's on cams, so you can switch between the two. I think that one was both\nreally difficult to pull off and it's also one of\nfew projects that I use in my every day life. Like I use it almost every day. - You know what a really\ncool one was that, that was part of your TED talk, where there's a rotating\nthing that you wear on your shoulders. Was that hard to make? So for people who haven't\nseen your TED talk. They should of course.\nBut it's how you describe- - [Simone] Oh, they cut out the best joke. - You put, how would you call\nthat device? Sorry I have. - I don't even know. I never used it beyond the\nTED talk, really. Yeah. But basically it's the shoulder\nrig and it has this like, almost like Saturn ring looking\nplatform that goes around. I can't even remember what\nthe problem proposition was that I was trying to solve. - Variety, probably, introduce\nvariety into your life? - [Simone] Yeah, maybe. - And the in an element of\nsurprise because you can put popcorn as you did\non it and it goes around as a little hand. Why is the like a tiny hand funny? I don't know, but it just slams whatever is on that finger into your face. - Yeah. I don't know.\n- Was that easy to make? - Yeah, that one was fine. I can't, there was, I mean\nmy TED talk was so, yeah, for one, once again they\ncut out my best joke. - [Lex] What was the best joke? - My best joke. And they\ndidn't even ask me about it. It was, so there's this\nwhole lead up where I built a chopping machine. So it's a machine that\nchops vegetables and it has two giant knives and it goes dun-dun-dun and it's kind of terrifying. And I show a video of it\nand then it ends on this gif of it chopping up a banana\nand I'm kind of scrunching up my face being like, ugh, ugh. - [Lex] Yeah. - And the whole reason I show that project is because I'm leading it\nup to the punchline of, oh, and as a bonus, this gif right here is the\nperfect response if anyone ever sends you dick pics you don't want, which brought down the\nhouse, it does it every time. And they cut it out without asking me. 'Cause they were like, oh, but we wanted people to be\nable to show it in classrooms. And I was like, I have abandoned the hope of being shown in classrooms for... Years ago. - I think that's a good joke.\n- Thank you. Thank you. - That's a really good one.\n- Yeah. - So you're okay going\nsometimes a little bit edgy? - I mean, I say that I'm\ncrude and wholesome... Because I can be very crude,\nbut I also try really, really hard to be a good person. - [Lex] Yeah. - And to like, I'll say shit\nand fuck and all that stuff, which I don't even think is crude. But, yeah. But I really, really try to\nwield the power that I have in a thoughtful way. So no, I wouldn't call\nme edgy because I'm not, I don't think it's edgy. It's all like- - Chopping a banana with\nknives and saying it's a good gif response to anyone\nthat sends you dick pics is definitely not edgy. You're correct. Yeah. - I think it's funny. It's a funny joke. - Yeah, it's pretty funny.\n- Yeah. - I feel bad that TED cut that. - I mean it's fine. It's like, it's a decision\nthat I made really early on where I was like, I think often people misinterpret what I'm doing as being for children, which I think is part\nbecause like my projects were always really cool, colorful and fun. But I think it also has some sprinkles of sexism of being like, oh,\nit's a woman doing something, she must be doing it for the children. And I'm like, oh, fuck the children. I'm doing it for myself.\n- Yes. Good. - So I think I was just really\nearly on decided of like, oh no, I'm not gonna try to cater to that. Which like still, I mean\nI get a lot of messages from parents being like, can you please stop\ncussing in your videos? And I'm also like, I get it, but also that is not what's\ngonna mess up your kids. - Yeah.\n- Like I really try to be- - Yeah.\n- Thoughtful and a decent enough role model, but I'll also acknowledge\nthat humans fuck. - Yeah.\n- It's okay. - Somehow that you being\nable to say the F you to the system.\n- What word? Word? - F.\n- What do... - I can't. I'm scared.\n(Simone laughing) It sounds better when you\nsay F you, it's a dance. I should, oh boy. Have you ever made a robot\nthat dances with you? - No.\n- Okay. - You need a dance partner. (laughs) - [Lex] I get lonely sometimes. - Yeah. I feel like that's the\ntheme of this whole podcast. Yeah. - Oh. (laughs) - What's the most\nembarrassed you've ever been on your podcast? - So, I don't know if\nyou've experienced this, but I am generally embarrassed\nby most things I say inside my head.\n- Yeah. - So like when I say\nsomething, like now, it's just, there's a voice inside\nmy head that goes, oh... - Yeah.\n- Like what... (laughs) You're a disappointment. Like the parent patting you on the back, the hand stops working. - Yeah.\n- Just slows down. Yeah. And then there's an awkward silence. You don't know what to say next. That's really embarrassing usually. - Yeah. So I used to work as\na journalist so I know how to sit with the silence\nand try to drag it out of you. - [Lex] See what I did there? (laughs) - You gave up. You pulled out. - I quit.\n- You're like... - I'm sweating. I quit. I'm literally sweating. Okay. - Also 'cause you're\nin a full fucking suit. What is that, like, how\ndid that come about? - Actually it was probably\nMIT is because everybody was dressing in like\nsweatpants, a very chill wear, and I was like, I like\ntaking everything seriously. It just felt like a, it was my way of saying F\nyou to the way things are. 'Cause I like, I always admire Richard Feynman and I\nlike it how there's like a classiness to it. So I don't know if it's\nfor visual purposes but it's just how I feel\nwhen I put on a suit. It makes me feel like I'm gonna take this really, really seriously. - Yeah.\n- And if I embarrass myself, it's all my fault 'cause I tried... There's no excuse. I tried 100%. The interesting thing about your TED talk, to go to a dark topic... - Mm. This is what happened\nwhen I walked off stage? - [Lex] No, what happened\nwhen you walked off stage? - Found out that I had a brain tumor. Was that not where you're going? - Yes.\n- There's something else dark about my, yeah.\n- Well, yes. I thought you knew through the TED talk, you found out right after. - I mean the reason that\nI found out was partly because of the TED talk\n'cause my mom came into town to be there for it, and my right eyelid was\nswollen and it had kind of been swelling over a while. And I even got comments\nabout it on my YouTube channel and I thought it was\nallergies 'cause I was like, oh, it's just pollen allergies, it's just affecting my one\neye 'cause maybe I sleep mostly on that side. I don't know. And my mom came into the States and then Vancouver for my TED talk and she's like, Simone, you have to like\nhave a scan or see what's up. Like, we have to go to the doctor. And she really pushed me to do it 'cause I was like, I'm fine. And I had an MRI scan on like 5:00 PM on a Friday night. My boyfriend at the time\nwas there and I remember like halfway through an MRI scan, they kind of pull you out and they inject contrast fluid or this\nlike thing that, yeah, just gives 'em another type of scan. And the nurse looked at me\nin this way and was like, how long have you had symptoms for? And that's when I knew\nthat they'd found something and then they like shove\nyou back into the machine for another 20 minutes. And my ex was just seeing\nlike them like zooming in and out of my scans and there was like this obviously something\nthat just looked wrong in there and they sent\nme to the ER and I found out that I had a brain tumor\nthe size of a golf ball that probably had been growing\nsince I was a teenager. So it'd been growing\nover like 10, 15 years. And yeah, I had surgery to\nremove it and then it kept on growing, the parts\nthat they couldn't remove and I went through radiation treatment. So that was like two years\nthat just was kind of dedicated to just getting better and getting back to where I am now. And I remember like I\nwas so stoked about 2020 'cause I was like this is\nthe first year that I'm not held back by my health and\nI'm like finally gonna be able to do everything I'm better, and then the pandemic happens and\nyou're kind of just like, okay, just in the backseat of\nwhat's happening and things that are outta my control again. - In your public, you made\na couple of videos about... - Yeah. - About it. I have a brain\ntumor, my brain tumor's back. You kind of, you know, you name your tumor\nBrian, you kind of make it a light-hearted thing, but so you don't reveal\nmuch of the darkness. But were you scared? What\nwere some low points? - Yeah, of course I was scared. I mean it's terrifying. It's like, and also when\nit's in your brain, like, you know, I was like\ntake any other part of me but don't take my brain. No. It's this unfathomable thing\nthat happens when you're like, I'm healthy, how could this\npossibly be a brain tumor? Like my eye is swollen.\nLike there's nothing there. I haven't had any seizures, I haven't had any cognitive issues, I haven't had any headaches even, like how is that even possible? So you go through a\nlot of different stages of just trying to understand what it is. And I think I remember being\nhit like right as I found out when we were in like\nan Uber, poor Uber driver, from where I had my MRI scan\nto the ER where they sent me. And I was really both really\ngrateful that I've gotten so much more outta life\nthan I ever thought I would. Like I've had a hell of a life and even if it would've\nended really early, I would've done so much\nmore than I ever thought. But I was also really, really sad that I hadn't had kids yet. Like that was my big grief of like, fuck, I haven't had time to have kids yet. But no, it's terrifying. I mean the prospect of\nsomebody cutting up your head, like that's terrifying. But it honestly wasn't as bad\nas I thought it was gonna be. - What about the radiation treatment? What are some things that,\nyou know, people should, well you learned about it, about the process and about yourself through that that people\nmight be interested about? - I think surgery was\nboth harder and easier than radiation treatment because... It was harder because it\nwas so much more intense and it's such a dramatic thing, like going to the hospital\nthat morning and being like, I don't know, and you feel so\nawful when you wake up and... But then the recovery\nfrom it was pretty linear. Like almost every week I\nwould get a little bit better. The thing about radiation is\nthat it was not linear at all, and it kind of drained me in this weird, like it was so hard to predict. And also they put me on these, I spent months feeling like\nI was high out of my mind, and I couldn't process reality in a way that I normally would. Like, everything just felt\noff, like I felt, yeah, I felt like I was high on drugs, and I kept on asking my\ndoctors what was going on and they're like, no, no, no, no, don't think it's anything related. And I was on this Alzheimer's\nmedicine that they put you on to prevent dementia\nfrom radiation treatment, like kind of as a preventative. And I found all these\nsubreddits of people using that Alzheimer's medicine to\nget high, and people be like, \"Oh my god bro, I took like 20 milligrams\nyesterday and I was high out of my mind,\" and I'm like,\nI'm on 30 milligrams a day. Like of course it feels weird. And that was honestly\none of the scariest parts of it because that was the\nfirst time where I felt like it genuinely affected my\nway of processing reality. And yeah, I was so relieved\nwhen I found out that that was what was causing it. 'Cause I felt like I was going crazy. But even after surgery, like I woke up and I felt like myself. Like everything was,\nI got no brain injury. So obviously this is like\nmy experience from somebody who came out of it pretty unscathed, who didn't get any brain\ninjuries and didn't have to do any of that recovery. It's more just the recovery\nfrom like the physical act of somebody cutting your\nskull open and taking a large chunk out. - Did you research all the\nthings that can go wrong? - No.\n- During surgery? - No. I honestly am, I'm a\nbit surprised by how I acted. Just pausing for you to pour.\nYou're welcome, editors. - This is like a commercial. - (laughs) This is like work\ninjury from being a YouTuber. This all like freeze if\nthere's audio that comes in. - Ah...\n- Ah. Yeah. Sponsored by tap water. I was surprised by how\nlittle I was willing to think critically about\nwhat my doctors told me to do. Like I, very early on, the neurologist that I worked with, he was the one who was\non call at the ER the day where I came in and he was\nthe one who ended up doing my surgery and he kind\nof became like my rock in this and I just 100%\ntrusted him and he turned out to be an amazing doctor\nand like did a great job and was just like, and... So I got so, so lucky. But I remember my mom being like, oh, but we should like talk about\nsecond opinions and like we should try to do more research. And I was like so unwilling\nto do that because opening up to the idea that there are multiple ways or multiple things that might be right or wrong was so terrifying. Like I wanted there to just be like, no, this is the only option,\nthis is what we need to do. And if I started questioning\nthat then I don't know if I would've been able\nto go through with it. So yeah, it was a strange, I just really wanted to trust the doctors that I worked with and I\nwas very scared to question them in any way. - How did that process change\nyour relationship with death? Are you afraid of death? - No.\n- Do you ponder your mortality?\n- Yeah, I think it took away a part of youth for me. - [Lex] Like the innocence? - Yeah, I mean you kind of\nthink of terrible things as something that happens to other people, and death and illness... So I think it kind of\nfast tracked that for me, but it mostly changed\nmy relationship to life. It changed, it's made me so\nmuch more gentle with myself. Like going through illness, it forces you to redefine\nwhat it means to be good. And before being good had been\npushing myself really hard. It had been working, and I don't know, just being really hard with\nmyself and disciplined, and when you're healing from something, being good is listening to\nyour body, it's resting. It's like really being in tune with what your health,\nwhere your health is at. And I think that is something\nthat's kind of stuck with me since then. I'm like so much more gentle\nand delicate with myself. - And with others? Are you? - Ah fuck it. I think it definitely, it's like when you're young and healthy it's really hard to-\n- Yeah. - Know what it feels like to be ill. And I remember, you know, you like go to yoga class\nand you'd be like, oh my god, this is too slow. Like I want it to be, I have so much more\nenergy like I need to... And when I was recovering\nfrom my brain surgery, there was this yoga studio nearby my house and they had yoga for\nseniors and I was so stoked 'cause I was like, oh, this is the yoga class\nI'll be able to take. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I think that was really\neye-opening of just like, there's no, you kind of imagine\nthat it's just like, oh, just push yourself harder. But no, that's not it. With age or sickness or it's just, you gotta be so gentle\nwith yourself and you have to cater to people where they're at. - Yeah. And just appreciation of\nthis like biological vehicle you get and you should take care of it? - Being sick sucks. - Yeah.\n- It's awful. And I really am really\nmotivated to postpone that for as much as I can. And also I was so tremendously\ngrateful when I got ill that I felt like I\nhad so much to take from, like I had so many energy reservoirs, I'd spent my life taking\npretty decent care of my body and like exercising and\neating well and like not wrecking my body in any way. And I felt like this was the\nfirst time where that was so critical and I felt like\nmy body was ready for it. You know? - I thought you were\ngonna go the other way. Like, you can take care of your\nbody all you want and it's, bad stuff happens. So you should go on drug\nbinges and go wild and do crazy things and... - I mean I also had that\nthought where I was like, I fucking floss every day. How do I have a brain\ntumor? I've been good. Like why does this happen to me? But more so it was like\nmy body was so resilient and ready for it, and I was\nreally, really proud of it. - Yeah, it's amazing that\nthe human body's able to recover from even the harshest things. - Yeah, it's wild. And my brain. So after, after surgery, 'cause yeah, I had a brain tumor the\nsize of a golf ball kinda behind my right eye. And after brain surgery\nyou kind of just have this big hole in your\nhead, like this void, and usually your brain stays that way. Like it retains the shape\neven after the brain tumor is gone. But for some reason my\nbrain was feeling really ambitious and it has\ncompletely flopped back and I have almost like a\nnormal looking brain now, where doctors are like, oh, we would almost not be able\nto tell that you had one. So yeah, that just blew my mind\nof being like, when did it, was that why I had all those\nheadaches after surgery? It's just my brain being like, ah. - Trying, working. Yeah. Oh, pretty cool Thing I wanted to ask you about is the Every Day\nCalendar that you worked on. - [Simone] Mm-hm. - That was a long time.\nThat took a long time. - Yeah, so basically I\ndesigned this calendar, like I wanted to start\nmeditating every day, but it's really hard to\nmeditate every day to like kind of build that habit. And what I would do is\nI would make these grids in my notebooks where I\ncould like check a box for every day. Like I just wanted like a little, ding, I did it and like this\nthing of accountability, but then I was like, this is, I don't wanna have a\nnotebook that I do this in. Like I want an art piece\nthat I can hang on my wall, like accountability art. And I made this thing called the Every Day Calendar, which\nhas an entire year on it. So it's 365 days and if\nyou tap any of the days you light it up and we\nturn it into a Kickstarter campaign and it's now a\nproduct that I'm selling through my product\nbusiness, the Yetch Store. - What's it called?\n- The Yetch Store. - Yeah. And that for people who are\nconfused is the right way to pronounce your last name. - It's right but it's so wrong. It makes, my last name\nis spelled G-I-E-R-T-Z. - Who does that song? \"If Loving You Is Wrong I\nDon't Want to Be Right.\" - Yeah. Pronouncing my last name, yeah. - That's all makes\nbecause, what's his name? From the Office. He covers it... From the British Office, which\nis the better Office. Okay. Tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent. So you said you created the\nEvery Day Calendar to make a more beautiful, in quotes, and more sacred gold\nstar system on a wall, not a notebook that gets\nthrown into a drawer. - Yeah. Wow. Well said, past me. - (laughs) You said that\nmaking this calendar taught you a lot, in quotes. I feel like a real\ninvestigative journalist. You've said, in 2018- - Yeah, I'm waiting for the gotcha. - Can you share some of\nthe lessons you've learned? Like what do you mean you've learned a lot from making this calendar.\n- Oh. - What are we talking about? - As somebody who builds things, manufacturing something is\nsuch an unrelated process, like making one of\nsomething and making 10,000 of something, like they're\nnot even distant cousins. Like it's completely\ndifferent beasts to tackle. And yeah, so that was one of it. Everything takes so much\nlonger than you think it's going to. I did a Kickstarter\ncampaign that we launched in 2018 after my surgery and, yeah, it's just, you know, you think you're so\ngenerous with the timelines, we still ended up being a\nyear late but we shipped. We're good. But yeah, I mean I'm trying\nto get my product business off the ground. We launched in May and it's\njust, yeah it's just a pain. As somebody who's terrified\nof disappointing people, I'm like why have I\nchosen some of the jobs where it's the easiest\nto disappoint people? - [Lex] You can disappoint\npeople at scale. No. - Yeah, I can disappoint\npeople at scale and also them actually having paid me\nmoney to deliver on something, which is a terrible transaction, but it's, I am just stoked to realize\nthat I love the job still. Like I love the product\ndevelopment aspect of it. I love trying to design\nstuff for manufacturing and figure it out and like\nanticipate how people are gonna use your products and like the Every Day Calendar, I\nmean we've sold thousands of them now, they're all over the world and it's like people\nactually finding something useful that I made and\nimplementing them into their lives. It's just mind boggling. - Especially 'cause this is\ntracking habits, good habits. So this is... - Or bad ones, you can do it wherever. You can use it however you want. - I went in a drinking binge again today. - Yeah.\n- Success. Great success. - Kicked another kid. - What does it take to\nmass manufacture something? What did you learn about that? Like what are, can you\nlike elucidate the gap between the one, the\nprototype versus the like product development for mass manufacturer? - I mean for one of it is\nlike, yeah, the manufacturing, the tooling that they use in manufacturing and to do things in a cost effective way is really different. Like I can make a one-off, then it's gonna take me 17 hours, but obviously you can't\nspend 17 hours per calendar when you're doing something in factory. I think it's that, like quality\ncontrol is such a beast. You cannot trust anybody\ntelling you that things are gonna be okay. Like you have to have such trust issues, and it's also terrifying. I mean as somebody who's doing\neverything independently, I haven't raised any capital for it. Like it's all self\ninvested and we're doing it all in-house. It's just, you know, yeah, I could buy 10,000 calendars\nbut then what if all of them are, have a\nmanufacturing issue or, you know, it's just terrifying because\nthe risks are so high, but also I got to this\npoint where, for one, this is something that I\nwanted to do for a long time, but something that going\nthrough health problems taught me is how fragile my business model is. Because, I mean, I'm basically running an influencer business where\nI make videos oh YouTube, and then I have an ad spot\nand I talk about a brand. So like I'm a human\nbillboard, which is fine, it grants me a lot of\nfreedom to play around. But if I am not well enough to\nbe on a stage, giving talks, or be in front of a\ncamera, everything stops. Like it's such a pillar\nof a business and it can topple over at any given\nmoment or like YouTube could change the algorithm, like legislation could catch up and change how you're able to\nadvertise on the internet. Like it's so frail and I\nreally felt like I need to diversify what I'm\ndoing and also just to keep it interesting for myself. So what I decided was to\nstart a product business because also it's kind of\nthis perfect combination of businesses where I can\nturn my YouTube channel into an R&D department\n'cause I have a reason to constantly be exploring\nthings and turning out new products. I can also do that as early\naudience testing and see what people are actually excited about. And if there's something\nthat I think would make an interesting product, I can pass that over to the product business and then once I'm ready to market that and sell it, I can pass it over to the YouTube channel. So it's like, I can kind of, once I realized that YouTube\ndidn't feel like an end goal for me, I was like, okay, then I can use it as a tool to accomplish these other things that\nI wanna do and this was one of them. So yeah, it's a lot that went into it. - And one of the tools, like I said, is R&D but it's also kind of advertisement for the cool stuff that you're doing. I think Mr. Beast is one of the creators that's also starting to\nunderstand this power of this reputation that\nyou've built of like people trust you, like they love\nyou, to do cool stuff, they trust that you put your\nheart and soul into a thing. - Yeah.\n- And so like, and they feel your pain\nand the struggle too. You know? Like if a product, like, for example, say the Every Day Calendar,\nlike there was issues in manufacturing something like this- - It would be hard. Yeah. - They would feel the pain of that and they would still support. I mean that that's the\nbeauty of it when you have the actual person right there struggling with their lows and highs. - That's a decision\nthat I made really early on where I was like, the Yetch Store is supported by me but it's separate from me. It's not merchandise. You don't have to know who\nI am or care about who I am to be interested in this product. And if you go on the website, yetch.store, plug, it's like it's, I'm on the about page, Y-E-T-C-H.store, like you have to go to\nthe about page to find anything about me. Like it's definitely not\nlike this is Simone's brand, and I think anybody who's\nfollowed me for a long time will see that like my\npersonality is sprinkled into it, but it's still like clean off of me. And I think that's also\nbecause I wanted something that was separate from me. 'Cause I am also running\nout of narcissism, believe it or not. I'm like, I don't feel like I wanna, I don't want it to be about me and I want it to be something that\ncan also run independently of me and doesn't, like I wanna\nbe able to retire my face, and still do like the other\nstuff because I think it's fun, but I don't want that\nto be the core of it. - What other kind of stuff have you worked on for the product design, for Yetch? - So I mean a lot of the products, I decided to launch the\nstore with a really small roster of products because\ndeveloping products is such a, it's such upfront, heavy, like cost-wise and just\ninvestment, such a, it's very big upfront investment. So, and I know that it would take a while, or I knew it would take a\nwhile for me to kind of find the right tonality and visual\nlanguage for the brand. So I just wanted to launch\nit, have it be out there, start working on it, start like learning more\nabout what it entails, even if we just had a\nsmall roster of products. So we've released it with,\nwe have a puzzle... (laughs) - Yes.\n- This is just a whim, but I wanted to release a puzzle that has one piece missing. So it's actually, as far as I can tell, it's the world's first\nofficially incomplete puzzle. You get 499 outta 500 pieces.\nI keep the 500th piece. So I have a box in my workshop with everybody's missing pieces. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I don't know what to do with it yet, but someday it will come to me. - Profound artistic statement. - It is something, it's definitely something\nand I'm surprised by how many of them we've\nsold, which I've also like, I kind of wanted to have\nthat product out there. 'Cause I was like, can you\nimagine having a pitch deck, if I do ever raise money of being like, you know how good I am at selling things? I sold people 5,000 incomplete puzzles. - Incomplete puzzles.\n- Yeah. Also have, you know, it's\nlike a lot of the products, I call them basket fillers, like they're kind of just like\nstuff where I'm like, yeah, this is like easy to\nthrow into your basket. I mean we have these\nrings, I'm wearing them. So there's a screwdriver ring, which is a Phillips head screwdriver, and then a screw ring\nthat kind of has a recess, like a Phillips head screw, have these sawdust socks\nthat make you look like your feet are covered in sawdust. Like you spend all time\nin the all day in the shop without having to put any\nof the actual effort in. But then we have four more\nproducts in the pipeline that we're working on and\nthat are kind of the more, the big ambitious products\nthat are more in line with what I want the brand to be. Like the tagline is unique\nsolutions to every day problems. And it's just a lot of\nlike trying to develop novel takes on existing products. - So something where the\nfunction becomes a bigger part of the design?\n- Yeah. - And so what's the process of creating something like that? Like even Every Day Calendar? So like what are some challenges that are interesting along the way? So you have to sketch it out,\nyou have to like brainstorm, draw things out and then\ncreate a schematic and see like how, how do you know what it's\ngoing to look like visually? - You don't. So the Every Day Calendar, the first, so I just built it for myself first. Like that did not come\nas a product idea first. And that's kind of been\nthe process that I've had for a lot of things. Like I make it for myself\nand then I'm like, oh, maybe other people would\nfind this useful too. So the Every Day Calendar,\nthe first prototype I made, it had actually physical\nmechanical toggle switches. So 365 toggle switches\nthat you could flip. So if you worked out\nthat day or meditated, for me it was meditating, you can just flip that\nswitch and that was great. But when I started evaluating\nit as a product, it's, if you have 365 of something in a product, like the runaway cost is crazy. So the cheapest option, most reliable option we could\nfind was capacitive touch. So basically it's a touch\ninterface and the front plate is a circuit board itself. So it's this like circuit\nboard that's designed in this really fancy way. So it looks like a beautiful piece of art. Not to toot my own horn too much, but it's actually a circuit board, which I also thought was\nreally interesting of like using this that people\nusually hide away in products. And it felt like a nod to\nmy career in electronics as well of being like, no, let's make it pretty and let's make it, put it front and forward. But yeah, I mean what I'm\nrealizing now more and more is like, there's so many of, like I would love to turn the\npuzzle table into a product, but then it's like that\nwould be a $7,000 table. And I don't wanna sell a table for $7,000. So you're kind of limited\nto the price bracket you're in and it's like\nyour margins are tough. Like maintaining your margins\nare really, really tough. And as somebody who's like, I would love to sell the stuff\nthat we're doing cheaper, but you just, it's just not feasible. Like you need those\nmargins to survive. And... - Well one of the genius\nthings in the conversations I've had with Elon is\nthe ability through sort of systematic questioning\nof how things have been done in the past to discuss\nwhat is the lowest cost way to solve a problem. And so he's very good at getting to, like with Optimus robot for\nexample, the humanoid robot, how do you get the cost down? - [Lex] Yeah. - And that seems to be like\none of the essential things to do in any product that\nyou have to mass manufacture is constantly discuss like\nhow do we simplify, simplify? - It's definitely a design\nlimitation that's interesting, it's both hard and interesting to work within and that's such a\ndifferent thing as well. It's like, I mean as\nI talked about before, like what is the context in\nwhich you're creating things? Like I'm still building things,\nI'm still inventing things, but I change the context\nand it has a very different set of limitations and\nconstantly trying to simplify your product to make it cheaper and, yeah, it's a really interesting\nand different type of design process. - You can lose some of\nthe magic though, right? Like people can do that\na little bit too much. I think Apple is famous, like Jony Ive is famous\nfor sort of focusing on the design first and not\nworrying about the cost later, 'cause you don't wanna sacrifice... There's some stuff that's gonna\ncost more, but it keeps... - Yeah.\n- Some of the magic. - I think it's for some of the products that we're working on,\nit's like, I'm like, let's just make it the best\nwe think it can be and then we can scale back from there. Like, just like let's not\nimpose these limitations on ourselves upfront. Like let's just make it\nthe most beautiful version of itself and then we\ncan decide what we wanna compromise with or compromise on. Yeah. - That's what I say every day\nwhen I look in the mirror. You just make the most beautiful... - And then we can compromise. Yeah. - [Lex] We'll just discuss- - It's why you put on that suit. - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - And then see how goes\nwrong later. All right. Back a little bit to the robots just, or actually to one of\nyour more epic projects. I mean they're all epic, but Truckla. - [Simone] Yeah. - You cutting into a Tesla and turning it into an epic truck. What was that like? Where\ndid the idea come from? - The idea came from that I really wanted an electric pickup truck.\n- Yeah. - Like I'm only really\ndriven electric because I got my driver's license pretty\nlate and I'm like one of that first generation drivers, it's like probably never\ngonna have a gas vehicle. But yeah. This was in 2018 as well. 2018 was a big year.\n- Yeah. - Yeah. Or 2019, I can't remember. And I figured that we\ncould just make our own. - So you took a Tesla?\n- Tesla Model 3. - Model 3.\n- Mm-hm. - And you cut off a\npiece of it and you turn into a pickup truck. What's the, (laughs)\nit looks pretty badass. So like what are some of the\nchallenges of doing that? It's unlike other projects you've done. - Yeah, it's very much\noutside of my realm. Like I'm not a car person. I haven't worked on cars\nbefore so we brought in a big team and had\nanother project manager for it and stuff. 'Cause also like, cars, you definitely don't\nwant things to go wrong. Like there's no part of me\nthat wants to fuck around and make something that's\ngonna be really unsafe for me or for other people who\nare driving with me. So yeah, I mean it was\nabout a year of planning, and then we got the car\nand then we spent a month just tearing it apart\nand trying to make it... I was so set like I really wanted the car just for its function, and I was like, I'm so fine\nwith it if it's really ugly. But then we managed to make\nit actually look really good. - Oh so that wasn't\npart of the discussion, like how the final thing looks? - I wasn't that fussed about it. I was like I just want\nit for its function. Like I really want this car, I don't want it because it looks cool. But then it ended up\nlooking pretty cool as well. And I'm really, I mean\neven now a couple of years later when there are some\nmore options of electric pickup trucks, I still stan Truckla. Like, she's, like Rivian, Ford F-150, like they're all great but they're giant. - You're sitting there on a\nporch in your cowboy hat... - Yep.\n- Drinking whiskey and saying- - With my cattle dog. Yeah. - Shotguns... - I wanted like small '90s pickup truck. - Back to shitty robots. You used parts of previous robots a lot. What's like a memorable example of that? It's just the graveyard\nof parts? In the workshop? - I've gotten better at\nkeeping projects intact. In the beginning I used to disassemble every project 'cause it was also a much more stringent budget. So if I needed a motor then\nI would like steal it off of an existing robot or a previous robot. But I've got a really good\nat not doing that now, because I'm like, maybe\none day I wanna have a museum exhibit and then\nthey would be nice to have all of those machines\nintact and not having to rebuild them. - Centuries from now, they'll, you know, you can look at Benjamin\nFranklin's house... - [Simone] Oh yeah, nobody's\ngonna look at my house. Yeah. - Simone Giertz's house. - No.\n- Just some weird shit. - Yeah. That goes great\nwith my idea of myself. - (laughs) With the autobiography? Yeah. - Yeah. - You said that people keep requesting in the comments that... - That I put a on dildo on it?\n- Yeah. - [Lex] I have- - Wait was that actually\nwhat you were gonna ask? - Yeah, I have dildo written in my notes. - I thought I just made it\ninto a raunchy punchline. You were actually gonna get there. Yeah, that was in the early\ndays in the shitty robot days. But now I have a filter\non my YouTube channel for every possible spelling of dildo. - So I mean, people want to probably\nsexualize robots, right? Or they put-\n- They wanna sexualize my relationship with them. Yeah.\n- Oh... - You know, 'cause I have\nmajority male followers, and they're so sweet and\nso like respectful, 99%. But I realize like, there is a lot of, I've realized that\nsociety hasn't taught men how to have female role models, and the way that people channel\nit is through being like, oh, it's because I wanna\nfuck her or I wanna date her or I wanna marry her. And I'm like, I don't think\nyou want any of those things. I think you actually just admire my work, but you don't know how\nto look up to a woman. - Yeah. That's beautifully put. What about weapons? Do you get requests to\nput weapons on a thing? - No. It's interesting, I kind\nof started in robotics as just like a happy camper who is really into like tinkering and\nnow I'm kind of seeing some of the darker parts of it, and I remember first time\nI went to a proper factory and I saw like big industrial\nworld robot arms at work and I was like, oh wow, this\nis what it is about, you know? And it was almost scary\nwhere I was like, oh, I've just been like playing around with these tiny versions of\nthis and I'm like, oh my god, everybody, robotics is cool and fun! And then you get in there and you're like, this is kind of terrifying. - You were platforming\nthe very things that will destroy human civilization.\n- Yes. - You're making it fun and entertaining. - I'm the mouthpiece and\nI'm like getting people into robotics and\nengineering and we're all just building our demise. - Yeah.\n- At accelerating speed. No, but I mean I had\nthat in like as the same with also with like\ncompanies who are saying that they're never gonna\nput weapons on their robots and then have military\ncontracts and stuff like that and you're like,\nthis is dark and scary. Fortunately I haven't gotten\na lot of requests for it. - Yeah. Drones are terrifying. Especially... - Drones are fucking terrifying, and it's really, everything... I mean we humans are so\ngood at creative ways of killing and fucking each other. It's like almost how everything goes. It's like, and it's, yeah, I'm terrified of the future\nwhere we are gonna use more robots to kill each other. - And come up with new and\nnew creative ways to kill and hurt each other.\n- Yeah. - Emotionally,\npsychologically, physically. - [Simone] Yeah. - Speaking of which, what\nare your thoughts about, I don't know if you've\nbeen paying attention, but ChatGPT, the advancement\nin language models and artificial intelligence. Have you added speaking\ncapabilities to any of your devices? - I have Siri on. Yeah. I used to have an Amazon Echo in my house, but then I removed it. It just freaked me out\nthat I could whisper from my bed and it heard me. - Yeah.\n- I'd be like, \"Alexa, play Spotify.\" It'd be like, \"Playing Spotify!\" - Yeah.\n- Oh fuck. I... I think it is a powerful\ntool that we are not fully ready for. - Yeah.\n- And I don't know, I think the internet is\nkind of a parade of us using powerful things in\nharmful ways and I think chatbots are really, really exciting. I am stoked to have a\npersonal assistant that's like a virtual assistant that\nactually does a good job and can solve problems for me. But, yeah, it also feels like it can get dark really, really quickly. - Yeah. 'Cause you can form close connections like we're talking about with\nit and then it can be used to manipulate you. Manipulate you in terms of what is true and manipulating you in terms of getting you to buy stuff.\n- Yeah. - Or maybe because at least\nfor now it's centralized, getting everybody to think the same way. - I mean for, I mean it's the same in like algorithms being used to radicalize people or kind of having that as a consequence of\nthe way that they work and combine that with a\nreally advanced language model and like you can control\npeople's worldview in a way that you couldn't. I mean it's just, it's wild and I think\nwe're not ready for it. And I don't know if we ever would be because we're very impressionable, little squishy flash bags. - [Lex] Takes us back to the one, the squishy flesh bags interact. Which one pops first, still- - Oh yeah, the bubble.\n- The bubble wrap. - Bubble on bubble. New paper coming out. - What we were talking about.\nOh, what about consciousness? So you never anthropomorphized the robots? Did they ever come to life for you? Where you kind of thought... - No, 'cause I've built them\nand I know how they work. - [Lex] So that prevents you from being able to see the magic? - I don't know. Yeah. But I think it's like, I definitely when I did a lot\nof the shitty robot stuff, like I wanted them to\nmove like a human or like in a more organic way and not\njust like point A to point B. - [Lex] Yeah. - Which is easiest way to program stuff. So I wanted other people\nto anthropomorphize them, but I don't think I did necessarily. I'm trying to think of\na piece of technology that I've kind of projected\nfeelings upon, but no, I can't. - So sometimes what makes me\nanthropomorphize something, even though I built it, is\nthere's element of surprise. So especially with machine learning, you're surprised by the\nkind of things it does. Have you ever been surprised by a robot? - No. 'Cause they're all pretty dumb. Like also the robots I built, it's like they're all\njust servos moving from, I mean they're, I don't\nthink I've built anything with a huge amount of sensors, like they're just moving in\na pattern that I programmed them to move. - What's the most complex\nthing you've built? - I mean, probably Truckla.\n- Truckla. - Yeah. Was complex just for the sheer\nscale of it and like the, I mean both, I think that\nwas my biggest project both in terms of build scope\nbut also in terms of impact that it had. Like that project just\nwent wild. But then, yeah. Then I don't know. The\nbubble wrap music box? I don't know. They're all\ncomplicated in different ways. - That one is epic. How does the bubble wrap\nconnect to the flute by the way? How does that work? - The flute is just right where, like mounted it right where it pops it. - Okay.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] That's so fascinating.\nI gotta watch that video. - Yeah. Have fun. - Funny enough, in my, in deep investigative\njournalistic research of you... - [Simone] Yeah? - Says you used to be an MMA reporter. - Yeah.\n- How? How? How? How did that happen? How'd you get into it? - I was really into martial arts. I was like a huge UFC buff.\nI mean, this is 2010, maybe. - [Lex] Did you practice\nmartial arts yourself? - I did, yeah. I was,\nmostly stand up, I did. Or like, I did a lot of\nMuay Thai and then some Brazilian jujitsu and\njust, yeah, I was really, the thing is I get really\nintense about my hobbies and I was so into it.\n- So you went all in. - I was all in.\n- Awesome. - And I had worked a\nlittle bit as a journalist and I was like, oh, I should like do MMA\nreporting and I emailed this MMA website in Sweden. I was like, hey, can I\ncome and write for you? And they were like, oh, actually we are going to an\nevent in Gothenburg tomorrow, do you wanna come? - [Lex] Yeah. - And I was like, wow, this is a lot. It's like 11:00 PM at\nnight, but sure, I'll come. And I went there to their office, I'd never really met them. And I'm like, this is kind of scary. Like I'm a 20 year old\ngirl and going there with a group of men,\nand they were so rude. They'd like, I went there and\nI was like, \"Hey, what's up?\" And they were all kind of\nignoring me and just like not looking at me or interacting with me, until they realized that Simon was a girl because we'd only talked over\nemail and they were like, oh, this guy named Simon is gonna come. And then they were like, oh, fuck, Simon. It's actually Simone. - Yeah.\n- And it's a girl. So I kind of like slid\ninto that in a very, very strange way. And I did that for a year, but then I got kicked out of an interview with Alexander Gustafsson,\nand I was like, oh- - Your pronunciation is so good. - Yeah. (laughs) And then I just kind of\nnever went back and I was done with it and now I'm\nnot allowed to do martial arts because of brain stuff. So, I've kind of put\nall of that behind me. And it's interesting. It's like I definitely see the athleticism in it and the skill that goes into it. I think as the older I get, the more concerned I am\nabout the health impacts of the sport and of the\npeople who are practicing it on an elite level. And I'm just not as, cannot as 100% just cheer\nas somebody beats somebody else up into a pulp. - Yeah. Especially considering\nthe effects you might have on the brain.\n- Mm-hm. - May I ask why you got kicked out of this Alexander\nGustafsson interview. Was it anything fun? - So, it is, no, it wasn't. I didn't intend to get kicked out. I didn't realize I was\ngonna get kicked out. So it was, Alexander Gustafsson\nwas gonna fight Jon Jones. - Yeah.\n- And he had just, he was kind of like this golden boy in Sweden and he had just\ncome out to the press that he had actually been\nto jail for violent crimes, and all I wanted to ask, all I asked was what was\nthe reason that you wanted to bring that forward now? And apparently that was\ncompletely like blacklisted, but I hadn't gotten\nbriefed about it at all. And the PR man, head a PR of the UFC\nwas just yelling at me and they kicked me out of,\nGrand Hotel in Stockholm. And I immediately called my\nmom and I was like, \"Mom, you will not believe what just happened. I got kicked out of an\ninterview in at Grand Hotel.\" Because in the '90s she got\nkicked out of an interview with Mel Gibson from the Grand Hotel, so that's like runs in the\nfamily. So I was just so... - Like she proud of you?\n- So yeah, no, it was just this weird\ngenerational skip where we both gotten kicked out of\ninterviews at the same hotel. - You spent quite a bit of\ntime in China as a student. Is that something you could speak to? The differences in culturally, maybe even from like a student in an engineering perspective\nbetween China and US, maybe even Sweden. Those are like technologically speaking just such fundamentally different places. - I mean I moved to China when I was 16. - Yeah.\n- And I went there as an exchange student. So that is before I had ever\ntouched upon those things. And it was, and then I went\nback when I was 19 to work as an English teacher for a little bit. It was... It was incredibly challenging to be there. - The language barrier,\nthe language, the culture? - All of it. I mean I was like, now when\nI look at 16 year olds, I'm like, you're a baby. And I moved, sorry, 10 to 16\nyear olds listening to this. But like, I just can't believe I did that. And yeah, I didn't speak the language, I got placed in like a small city with almost no foreigners. It was just a constant audience\nof people staring at you, because they haven't interacted with a lot of foreigners before. And yeah, it definitely, and then after that I\nmoved to Kenya and I think that was one of the reasons\nwhy it was so interesting to move to the States\nbecause people were like, oh, isn't it like hard with\nthe language barrier or the cultural difference? And I was like, dude, this is nothing. And I could speak the\nlanguage like I could speak English well and I could kind of pass as an American even just as I moved here. And it was such a relief\nwhere I was like, wow, I'm like an undercover foreigner, because I got to a point\nwhere I realized like, it doesn't matter how good my mandarin is, people are never gonna\nfully accept me here. So, yeah.\n- And you moved, you went to Kenya,\nyou've spoken about this, after your parents got divorced? - Yeah. When did I talk about that? Didn't realize I told that story. - [Lex] I know... I know so many things. What do you think this is? - Is it from when I have\nmy Amazon Echo installed? - Yeah-\n- Yeah, so... - [Lex] Made a few contacts. - I came home from China first\ntime I was there for a year. It's one of the most turned\nupside down days of my life. I spent a year there and I was so excited. I had really rough year\nand I was so excited just to come home and\nlike be a child again. I remember thinking and just\nlike feeling like I belonged. And then I came home and I\nfound out that my parents had separated when I was gone. And they hadn't told me\nbecause they wanted to like not affect my stay there, which I think was 100% the\nright decision of them to make. But I kind of came home to\na house that was starting to get picked apart. And- - Such a big shock to you world. - It was, both yes and no. I think I remember I\njust sat down on my bed and I was like, well, this\nisn't what I expected, but I guess I'll move to\nKenya because I was one of the few, there were a\nfew Swedish boarding schools in the world. There was one in Brussels, Paris, London, and then one in Nairobi. And I didn't wanna miss more\nschool because I'd taken a gap year when I went to China. So I was like, I guess I'll go to Nairobi. And I'm thinking now, like I think if my parents\nhad stayed together, granted, it was amazing that they did, made the right decision in every way. But my roots kind of never\ngrew back after that. And I think I just kept on\nmoving abroad and moving around and being really\nrestless and, yeah... And... - Have you ever been able\nto find a home, spiritually? - No, I have a home. Yeah. I mean I have a home in the\npeople around me and I have a lot of different homes. You know, it's, I think\nwhat I'm realizing more and more is like you cannot live without consequence and compromise. And sometimes I can envy\npeople who have that like same friend group that they\nhad their entire life or that, you know, just really belong in a place. And I realize that would be amazing. But I've chosen different experiences. And one of the upsides\nof that is I can feel home almost anywhere. One of the downsides of\nthat is that I cannot feel fully at home anywhere. - Wow. That's deeply and darkly poetic. - [Simone] Yeah. Do you feel at home? - Probably the way you put\nit is really beautifully put. Yeah. No, I have to find\nhome in the people I love. - [Simone] Yeah. - What advice would you give\nto young people that look at your stellar life, the trajectory of your\ncareer as a human being, as a creator, as a\nengineer, as a designer, as a incredibly interesting personality, who's working on an autobiography. What advice would you give them? Like how to make their way in this life? Maybe high school students,\nmaybe college students, on how they can have a\ncareer they can be proud of, or life they can be proud of? - Oh my god, Lex. Hmm... You know, it's, this is not the advice, but there are very few\nmoments in a career that feel as good as you think they are going to. And there are very few\nmoments of feeling really proud of yourself. Like, I feel like I often\njust feel like I'm not doing it well enough or big enough or, and now I just had one of\nthose moments like hearing you say that I'm like, oh,\nI'm actually doing okay. I think my main advice is\nenthusiasm is a much more potent fuel in life than duty. And just because something\nis boring doesn't mean that it's important. I kind of realized for\nmyself that like I'm so much better at the things I enjoy, but school doesn't really\nteach us how to stay excited about something and how to stay enthusiastic about something. And if you can find that, then like you got a\ngold mine of potential. So I kind of had to\nreprogram myself to be like, just because this is fun, doesn't mean that it's not important, because I had so much guilt\nabout it in this weird way or where I'm like, no, this is too fun. This can't be work. And I'm\nlike, no, it's still work. The boring stuff isn't more important. - And the vice versa as you said, just because it's boring\nand hard doesn't mean it's the right thing to do? - Yeah.\n- That's interesting. I'm gonna have to take that\nadvice and think through it. 'Cause I'm, genetically, I'm built a little bit like\nif this is really unpleasant, it's probably good for me. - [Simone] Yeah. - And it's a dangerous thing to think. Sometimes it's true, sometimes it's not. - Yeah. No. And it's like what comes\nreally easy and where do you have that kind of effortless momentum and enthusiasm and that\nis kind of the sweet spot. I think that I'm also really\nhappy that I spent time trying out so many different jobs. I mean, I've had so many\ndifferent jobs before I did it and I would do things\nfor a year and then I quit and it feels like I tried\non a bunch of different pants and you're like, okay,\nI can kind of wear this, but they're like not super\ncomfortable or I don't love the look of them or whatever. And now I feel like I've\nfound this pair of pants that just like fits me\nperfectly and that perfectly caters to my strengths and my weaknesses. Like I used to work as an editor for the Swedish government,\nand I remember thinking like, oh, I need to be okay\nthat not a lot of things are happening and that\nthings are moving slowly and that the work is\nkind of like monotonous. And then I realize like, or maybe I should be in a workplace where it's a benefit or\nstrength that I want a lot of things to happen and that\nI can handle a high speed. - [Lex] Yeah. - You know, and I think\nthat is really such a good question to ask as well. Like what are my strengths?\nWhat are my weaknesses? And then what context are most\nof these things strengths? - If you're know that, if\nyou know the measurements, you can find the right fitting pants? - Yeah. Or the right suit,\nas Lex will tell you. - What do you think is a meaning of life? - [Simone] Oh, I don't\nthink there's any meaning. - It's a meaningless void? - No, just that it doesn't\nhave any meaning doesn't mean that it's meaningless. I don't think that there's\nthis big grand meaning. I think a more important question is what brings you substantial\njoy in your life? To me it's the relationships\nwith people that I have. - [Lex] Love? - Yeah. I mean love in all\ndifferent kinds of form. It's, I'm really working on\nfiguring out how to build more community, especially\nin a society that isn't really made for it. I want more passive hangouts with people, where like I just want\npeople who are there. - Together?\n- To get high? - No, together.\n- Okay. To get high? - Together?\n- Yeah. I mean, I, like, I think seeing somebody for\nlunch and kind of shooting the shit and what's the\nlatest with you is great, but like what I want is\nsomebody to just roll up in sweatpants and open my\nfridge and like be like, what are you gonna do? I don't know. Maybe I'll read a book. Like, yeah. I think that... - Just sharing kinda like silence. - Sharing silence, being alone together. And that just, that type\nof community I think is what I'm really seeking out now. 'Cause I think, yeah. And also like working on a goal, on a joint goal together\nwith other people. And I think being a YouTuber\ncan be really lonely. I mean, as much as I'm working\nwith a team, it's like, yeah, I just wanna work in\na bigger project and kind of have that sense of, wow,\nwe're like doing this together. 'Cause I think that accesses\nmy pride a lot better than just being proud of myself. It's so much easier for\nme to be proud of a team than for me to be proud of myself. - That's probably good\nadvice for people who are doing creative work on YouTube too. To work on a team. - Yeah. And just choose, try to do things, and take it from the\nQueen of Shitty Robots. But like, try to do things with integrity. - [Lex] Former. - Former Queen of Shitty Robots.\nDo things with integrity. Like anything you do on\nthe internet is kind of, I think of things as\ntattoos on my internet and on my internet self. And I'm really happy that\nI said no to some things early in my career that I know that I would've regretted now. And you know, just think\nof it in the long term, like going viral is\noverwhelming and so stressful and so fun, but like so intense. And I'm really happy\nthat I managed to build that into a more long-term\ncareer than just have it be something that passed. - And come down from the viral moment and maintain your humanity? - Yeah. And also really deliberately\ndefining what success means to you, because\nthere are so many reasons or so many definitions that\nother people will give you. And especially when you're\nworking on the internet, there are just numbers\nupon numbers that are like, you're doing well, you're not doing well. And something I'm really\nhappy that I did was early on, I really try to think of like, what does success look like for me? And I realized that it's\nnot having the world's biggest YouTube channel, it's being proud of the projects that I put\nout and having full say in how I spend my time. Like that is the most\nimportant thing to me. And if I had a huge YouTube\nchannel and I was making so much money, but I kind\nof had this machine run me rather than the other way around, like to me it's so important\nto be able to wake up in the morning and be like, I\ndon't wanna do this any more. And for that to be okay. And I think I defined\nthat for myself early on and I've really tried\nto live by it and made decisions after that. And I'm really happy that I did that. - And also you're, with the store, with the design you're doing now, you're putting a little\nbit of love in the products you create at scale. I mean, that's what Jony Ive\ndid. That's the cool thing. So you can create something\nbeautiful and then people can share that love at scale. - It's terrifying and beautiful\nand I'm so here for it. - I'm here for it too. I'm a big fan. I'm a big fan of who you are, I'm a big fan of everything you do, of putting yourself out there, putting your love out there in terms of the designs you create. Also, just because I'm a fan of robotics, I think you inspire a lot of people. Like the shitty robots are\nactually incredible robots, and it's incredible\nengineering, that's all, that's the best combination\nof design and engineering and fun, all of it together. So thank you for doing that. I'm a big fan. You're an inspiration. And thank you for sitting\ndown with me. This is awesome. - Thank you so much for having me. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Simone Giertz. To support this podcast\nplease check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Kurt Vonnegut. \"We have to continually\nbe jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
