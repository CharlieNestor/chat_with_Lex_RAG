      "text": "- It's not our business to\nchange the Russian government. And anybody who thinks it's a\ngood idea to do regime change, in Russia, which has more\nnuclear weapons than we do, is, I think, irresponsible. And, you know, Vladimir\nPutin himself has had, you know, we will not live\nin a world without Russia. And it was clear when he said that, that he was talking about himself, and he has his hand on a button\nthat could bring, you know, Armageddon to the entire planet. So why are we messing with this? It's not our job to change that regime. And, we should be making\nfriends with the Russians. We shouldn't be treating him as an enemy. Now, we've pushed him\ninto the camp with China. That's not a good thing for our country. And by the way, you know, what we're doing now does not appear to be weakening Putin at all. - The following is a conversation\nwith Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Candidate for the President\nof the United States, running as a Democrat. Robert is an activist, lawyer and author, who has challenged some of\nthe world's most powerful corporations seeking to\nhold them accountable, for the harm they may cause. I love science and engineering. These two pursuits are, to me, the most beautiful and powerful, in the history of human civilization. Science is our journey, our fight, for uncovering the laws of\nnature and leveraging them, to understand the universe and to lessen the amount of suffering in the world. Some of the greatest human\nbeings I've ever met, including most of my good friends, are scientists and engineers. Again, I love science, but science cannot\nflourish without epistemic, humility without debate,\nboth in the pages of academic journals and in the public square. In good faith, long form conversations. Agree or disagree, I\nbelieve Robert's voice should be part of the debate. To call him a conspiracy theorist, and arrogantly dismiss everything he says, without addressing it,\ndiminishes the public's trust, in the scientific process. At the same time, dogmatic skepticism of all scientific output\non controversial topics, like the pandemic is equally, if not more, dishonest and destructive. I recommend that people read and listen, to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. His arguments and his ideas. But I also recommend, as I\nsay in this conversation, that people read and listen\nto Vincent Racaniello, from \"This Week in Virology,\" Dan Wilson from \"Debunk The Funk,\" and the Twitter and books\nof Paul Offit, Eric Topol, and others who are outspoken, in their disagreement with Robert. It is disagreement, not conformity, that bends the long arc of\nhumanity toward truth and wisdom. In this process of disagreement, everybody has a lesson to teach you, but we must have the humility to hear it, and to learn from it. This is \"The Lex Fridman\nPodcast,\" to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Robert F. Kennedy Jr."

      "text": "It's the 4th of July Independence Day. So simple question, simple, big question. What do you love about this country, the United States of America? - I would say, well, there's so many things that\nI love about the country on, you know, the landscapes and\nthe waterways and the people, et cetera, but on the kind of a, you know, the higher level, people argue about whether\nwe're an exemplary nation. And, that term has been given a bad name, particularly by the neocons,\nthe actions, the neocons, in recent decades who have turned that, that phrase into kind of a justification, for forcing people to adopt\nAmerican systems or values, at the barrel of a gun. But my father and uncle used\nit in a very different way, and they were very proud of it. I grew up very proud of\nthis country because, we were the exemplary nation, in the sense that we were an example, of democracy all over the world. When we first launched\nour democracy in 1780, we were the only democracy on Earth. And by the Civil War, by 1865,\nthere were six democracies. Today there's probably\n190 and all of them, in one way or another, are modeled, on the American experience. And it's kind of\nextraordinary because sort of, our first contact with, our first serious and sustained contact, with the European culture and continent, was in 1608 when John Winthrop came over, with his puritans in the Arbella, and Winthrop gave this\nfamous speech where he said, \"this is a gonna be a city on a hill. This is gonna be an example for, you know, all the other nations in the world.\" And he warned that his fellow puritans, they were, you know, sitting at the, this great expanse of land. And he said, \"we can't be, we can't be seduced, by the lure of real estate, or by the carnal\nopportunities of this land. We have to take this\ncountry as a gift from God, and then turn it into an example, for the rest of the world of God's love, of God's will, and wisdom.\" And 200 years later, 250 years later, a different generation. They're mainly deists. They are people who had a belief in God, but not so much a love, of particularly religious cosmologies. You know, the framers, the Constitution, believe that we were creating something, that would be replicated around the world. And that it was an example. It would, in democracy,\nthere would be this kind of wisdom from the collective, you know, and the word wisdom means\na knowledge of God's will. And that somehow God would\nspeak through the collective, in a way that, that he or\nshe could not speak through, you know, through totalitarian regimes. And, you know, I think\nthat that's something, that even though Winthrop was\na white man and a Protestant, that every immigrant\ngroup who came after them, kind of adopted that belief. And I know my family when, you know, my family came over, all of\nmy grandparents came over, in 1848 during the potato famine. And, they saw this country\nis unique in history, is something that, you know, that was part of kind of a\nbroader spiritual mission. And so, I'd say that from\na 30,000 foot level that, I grew up so proud of this\ncountry and believing that it was the greatest country in the\nworld, and for those reasons."

      "section": "Freedom",
      "text": "- Well, I immigrated to this country. And one of the things that really embodies America to me is the ideal of freedom. Hunter S. Thompson said, \"freedom is something that\ndies unless it's used.\" What does freedom mean to you? - To me, freedom does not\nmean, you know, chaos. And it does not mean anarchy. It means that, it has to be accompanied by restraint. If it's going to live up to its promise, in the self-restraint, what it means is the\ncapacity for human beings, to exercise and to fulfill their, their creative energies unrestrained, as much as possible by government. - So this point that Hunter\nS. Thompson has made, it \"dies unless it's used.\" Do you agree with that? - Yeah, I do agree with that. And you know, he was not\nunique in saying that, you know, Thomas Jefferson\nsaid that the Tree of Liberty had to be watered with the\nblood of each generation. And what he meant by that is that, you can't live off, we can't live off the laurels of the American Revolution. That, you know, we had a group, we had a generation where between 25,000, and 70,000 Americans died. They gave their lives, they\ngave their livelihoods, they gave their status,\nthey gave their property, and they put it all on the line, to give us our bill of rights and that. But those Bill of Rights, the moment that we signed them, there were forces within our society, that began trying to chip away at them. And that, you know, happens\nin every generation. And it is the obligation\nof every generation, to safeguard and protect those freedoms. - The blood of each generation."

      "section": "Camus",
      "text": "You mentioned your interest, your admiration of\nAlbert Camus of stoicism, perhaps your interest in existentialism. Camus said, I believe,\nin \"Myth of Sisyphus,\" \"the only way to deal\nwith an unfree world, is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is\nan act of rebellion.\" What do you think he means by that? - I suppose the way that\nCamus viewed the world, and the way that the stoics did, and a lot of the existentialists was, that it was so absurd and that, the problems and the\ntasks that were given, just to live a life are so insurmountable, that the only way that we can\nkind of get back at the gods for giving us this, you know, this impossible task of living life, was to embrace it and to enjoy it, and to do our best at it. I mean, to me, you know, I read Camus, and particularly in\nthe \"Myth of Sisyphus,\" kind of as a parable that, and it's the same lesson that I think, he writes about in \"The Plague,\" where we're all given\nthese insurmountable tasks, in our lives, but that by doing our duty, by being of service to others, we can bring meaning\nto a meaningless chaos, and we can bring order to the universe. And, you know, Sisyphus, was kind of the iconic hero of the stoics. And he was a man because he did, because he did something good. He delivered a gift to humanity. He angered the gods,\nand they condemned him, to push a rock up the hill every day. And then it would roll down. When he got to the top,\nit would roll down, and he'd spend the night\ngoing back down the hill, to collect it and then rolling it back, back up the hill again. And the task was absurd,\nit was insurmountable. He could never win. But the last line of that book\nis one of the great lines, which is something to the\nextent that, you know, \"I can picture Sisyphus smiling.\" Because Camus' belief\nwas that even though, his task was insurmountable,\nthat he was a happy man, and he was a happy man because he put his shoulder to the stone. He took his duty, he embraced the task, and the absurdity of life, and he pushed the stone up the hill. And that if we do that, and if, you know, we find ways of being\nof service to others, that is, you know, the ultimate,\nthat's the key to the lock. That's the solution to the puzzle. - Each individual person in\nthat way can rebel against absurdity by discovering meaning\nto this whole messy thing. - And we can bring meaning\nnot only to our own lives, but we can bring meaning\nto the universe as well. We can bring some kind of order to life. And, you know, the embrace of those tasks, and the commitment to service\nresonates out from us, to the rest of humanity in some way."

      "section": "Hitler and WW2",
      "text": "- So you mentioned \"The Plague,\" by Camus. There's a lot of different\nways to read that book, but one of them, especially\ngiven how it was written, is that the plague\nsymbolizes Nazi Germany, and the Hitler regime. What do you learn about human nature, from a figure like Adolf Hitler? That he's able to captivate\nthe minds of millions, rise to power and take on, pull in the whole world into a global war? - I was born nine years after\nthe end of World War II, and I grew up in a generation\nthat was, you know, with my parents who were fixated on that, on what happened. And my father at that time, you know, the resolution in the\nminds of most Americans, and I think people around\nthe world is that there was, there had been something\nwrong with the German people, that, you know, the Germans had been particularly susceptible to\nthis kind of demagoguery, and to following a powerful leader, and just industrializing\ncruelty, and murder. And my father always differed with that. My father said, this is\nnot a German problem. This could happen to all of us, we're all just inches away from barbarity. And the thing that keeps\nus safe in this country, are the institutions of our\ndemocracy, our constitution. It's not our nature, you\nknow, our nature has to, has to be restrained and that\ncomes through self-restraint. But it also, you know,\nthe beauty of our country, is that we develop, we\ndevise these institutions, that are designed to allow us to flourish, but at the same time, not to give us enough freedom to flourish,\nbut also create enough order, to keep us from collapsing into barbarity. So, you know, one of the\nother things that my father talked about from when\nI was little, you know, he would ask us this question. If you were the family and\nAnne Frank came to your door, and asked you to hide her, would you be one of\nthe people who hid her? Like, risk your own life, or would you be one of the\npeople who turned her in? And of course we would all say, well, of course we would hide Anne\nFrank and take the risk. But, you know, that's been something, kind of a lesson, a\nchallenge that has been, that has always been near\nthe forefront of my mind, that if a totalitarian system ever occurs, in the United States, which my father thought\nwas quite possible. He was conscious about how\nfragile democracy actually is. That would I be one of\nthe ones who would resist, the totalitarianism or would\nI be one of the people, who went along with it? Would I be one of the people\nwho was at the train station, and, you know, in Kraków or, even Berlin and saw people\nbeing shipped off to camps, and just put my head down\nand pretend I didn't see it, because talking about\nit would be destructive to my career and maybe my\nfreedom and even my life. So, you know, that has been\na challenge that my father gave to me and all of\nmy brothers and sisters. And it's something that\nI've never forgotten. - A lot of us would like\nto believe we would resist, in that situation, but the\nreality is most of us wouldn't. And that's a good thing to think about, that human nature is\nsuch that we're selfish, even when there's an atrocity\ngoing on all around us. - And we also, you know, we have the capacity to deceive ourselves, and all of us tend to\nkind of judge ourselves, by our intentions and our actions. - What have you learned about life, from your father, Robert F. Kennedy? - First of all, I'll\nsay this about my uncle, 'cause you know, I'm\ngonna apply that question to my uncle and my father, my uncle was asked when he\nfirst met Jackie Bouvier, who later became Jackie Kennedy. She was a reporter for a\nnewspaper, and she was doing, she had a kind of column where she'd do, these kind of pithy interviews\nwith both famous people, and kind of man in the street interviews. And she was interviewing\nhim and she asked him, she thought what he believed\nhis best quality was, his strongest virtue. And she thought that he would say courage, because he had been a war hero. He was the only president who, and this when he was senator, by the way, who received the Purple Heart. And you know, he had a\nvery kind of famous story, of him as a hero in World War II. And then he had come home\nand he had written a book, on moral courage among\nAmerican politicians, and won the Pulitzer Prize, that book \"Profiles and Courage.\" And which was a series of incidents, where American political\nleaders made decisions, to embrace principle,\neven though their careers were at stake and in most cases, were destroyed by their choice. She thought he was gonna\nsay courage, but he didn't. He said curiosity. And I think, you know,\nlooking back at his life, that the best, that it was true, and that was the quality that allowed him, to put himself in the\nshoes of his adversaries. And he always said that if you, if the only way that\nwe're gonna have peace, is if we're able to put ourselves, in the shoes of our adversaries, understand their behavior\nand that context. And that's why he was able\nto, you know, during the, he was able to resist the\nintelligence apparatus, and the military during the\nBay of Pigs, when they said, you've gotta send in the\nEssex, the aircraft carrier. And he said, no, even though\nhe'd only been in month, two months in office, he was able to stand up to them, because he was able to\nput himself in the shoes, of both Castro and\nKhrushchev and understand, there's gotta be another solution to this. And then during the Cuban missile crisis, he was able to endure\none, the narrative was, okay, Khrushchev acted in a way, as an aggressor to put\nmissiles in our hemisphere. How dare he do that? And Jack and my father were able to say, well, wait a minute, he's doing that, because we put missiles\nin Turkey and Italy, that were right on, you know, and the Turkish ones, right\non the Russian border. And they then made a\nsecret deal with Dobrynin, with Ambassador Dobrynin, and, you know, with Khrushchev, to remove\nthe missiles, in Turkey, if he moved the Jupiter\nmissiles from Turkey, so long as Khrushchev\nremoved them, from Cuba, there were 13 men on the end, what they call the End CON Committee, which was the group of\npeople who were deciding, you know, what the action was, what they were gonna do to\nend the Cuban missile crisis. And virtually I, and of those men, 11 of them wanted to invade\nand wanted to bomb and invade. And it was Jack, and\nthen later on, my father, and Bob McNamara, who\nwere the only people, who were with him. Because he was able to see the world, from Khrushchev's point of view, he believed that there\nwas another solution. And then he also had the moral courage. So my father, you know, to\nget back to your question, famously said that moral courage, is the most important\nquality, and it's more rare, than courage on the football field, or courage in battle\nthan physical courage. It's much more difficult to come by, but it's the most important\nquality in a human being. - And you think that kind of empathy, that you referred to, that\nrequires moral courage. - It certainly requires\nmoral courage, to act on it, you know, and particularly, any time that a nation is at war, there's kind of a momentum\nor an inertia that says, okay, let's not look at this, from the other person's point of view. And that's the time we\nreally need to do that."

      "section": "War in Ukraine",
      "text": "- Well, if we can apply\nthat style of empathy, style of curiosity to the\ncurrent war in Ukraine, what is your understanding of why Russia, invaded Ukraine in February, 2022? - Vladimir Putin could have\navoided the war in the Ukraine. His invasion was illegal,\nit was unnecessary, and it was brutal. But I think it's important for us, to move beyond these kind\nof comic book depictions. Of this insane,\navaricious, Russian leader, who wants to, you know,\nrestore the Soviet Empire. And that, that's why, and\nwho made a unprovoked, unprovoked invasion of the Ukraine. He was provoked and we were provoking him, and we were provoking him, since 1997. And it's not just me\nthat's saying that, I mean, before Russia, before Putin never came in, we were provoking Russia, Russians, in this way unnecessarily. And to go back that time in 1992, when the Russians moved out of, when the Soviet Union was collapsing, the Russians moved out of East Germany, and they did that, which was\na huge concession to them. They had 400,000 troops in\nEast Germany at that time, and they were facing NATO troops, on the other side of the wall. So Gorbachev made this huge concession, where he said to George Bush, \"I'm gonna move all of our troops out, and you can then reunify\nGermany under NATO,\" which was a hostile army to the Soviet. It was created to, you know, with hostile intent\ntoward the Soviet Union. And he said, \"you can take\nGermany, but I want your promise that you will not move NATO, to the east.\" And James Baker, who was\nhis secretary of State, famously said, \"I will not move NATO. We will not move NATO\none inch to the East.\" So then five years later in\n1997, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was kind of the father of the neocons, who was a Democrat at that time, served in the Carter administration. He said, he published\na paper, a blueprint, for moving NATO right up\nto the Russian border, a thousand miles to the East, and taking over 14 nations. And at that time, George Kennon, who was the kind of the\ndeity of American diplomats, he was probably, arguably\nthe most important diplomat in American history. He was the architect of the containment policy during World War II. And he said, \"this is\ninsane and it's unnecessary. And if you do this, it's\ngonna provoke the Soviet, I mean, the Russians\nto a violent response. And we should be making\nfriends with the Russians. They lost the Cold War. We should be treating 'em\nthe way that we treated our adversaries after World War II, like with a Marshall Plan to\ntry to help them incorporate, into Europe and to be part\nof the brotherhood of, you know, of man and of western nations. We shouldn't continue to be\ntreating him as an enemy, and particularly surrounding\nthem at their borders.\" William Perry, who was then, the Secretary of defense\nunder Bill Clinton, threatened to resign. He was so upset by this plan\nto move NATO to the east. And William Burns, who was\nthen the US Ambassador, of the Soviet Union, who\nis now at this moment, the head of the CIA, said\nat the time, the same thing. \"If you do this, it is going to provoke the Russians toward a military response.\" And we moved it, we\nmoved all around Russia, we moved to 14 nations a\nthousand miles to the East, and we put Asia's missile\nsystems in two nations, in Romania and Poland,\nso we did what, you know, what the Russians had done to\nus in 1962 that had provoked, would've provoked an invasion of Cuba. We put those missile systems back there, and then we'd walk away,\nunilaterally walk away, from the two nuclear missile treaties, the intermediate nuclear missile treaties, that we had with this Soviet, with Russia. And, neither of us would put on those missile systems on the borders. We walk away from that and we\nput Asia's missile systems, which are nuclear capable. They can carry the tomahawk missiles, which have nuclear warheads. So the last country that they\ndidn't take was the Ukraine. And the Russians said, and\nin fact Bill Perry said this, or William Burns said, it is now the head of the CIA. It is a red line, if we go, if we bring NATO into Ukraine, that is a red line for the Russians. They cannot live with it,\nthey cannot live with it. Russia has been invaded three\ntimes through the Ukraine. The last time it was invaded, we killed, or the Germans killed one\nout of every seven Russians. They destroyed, my uncle\ndescribed what happened to Russia, in his famous American\nuniversity speech, in 1963, 60 years ago this month, or last month, 60 years ago, in June, June 10th, 1963. He told, that speech was\ntelling American people, put yourself in the shoes of the Russians. We need to do that if we're gonna, if we're gonna make peace. And he said, \"all of us\nhave been taught, you know, that we won the war, but\nwe didn't win the war. The Russians, if anybody\nwon the war against Hitler, it was the Russians, their\ncountry was destroyed. All of their cities.\" And he said, \"imagine if all of the cities\nfrom the east coast of Chicago were reduced to rubble and\nall of the fields, burned, all of the forests, burned. That's what happened to\nRussia, that's what they gave. So that we could get rid of Adolf Hitler.\" And he had them put\nthemselves in their position. And you know, today, there's\nnone of that happening. We have refused repeatedly,\nto talk to the Russians. We've broken up, there's two treaties, the Minsk agreements, which the Russians were willing to sign, and\nthey said, \"we will stay out.\" The Russians didn't want the Ukraine. They showed that, when the Donbas, when they voted 90 to 10\nto leave and go to Russia, Putin said, \"no, we want\nUkraine to stay intact, but we want you to sign a Minsk accords,\" to, you know, the Russians\nwere very worried, because of the US involvement in the coup, in Ukraine in 2014. And then the oppression, you know, and the killing of 14,000 ethnic Russians. And Russia hasn't had, the same way, that if Mexico, with\nAsia's missile systems, from China or Russia on our border, and then killed 14,000 expats American, we would go in there. Oh, he does have a national security interest in the Ukraine. He has an interest in protecting the Russian speaking\npeople of the Ukraine, the ethnic Russians. And the Minsk accords did that. It left Ukraine as part of Russia. It left them as a semi-autonomous region, that could continued to\nuse their own language, which is essentially banned by the coup, by the government we put in, in 2014. And, we wouldn't, we\nsabotaged that agreement. And, we now know in April of 2022, Zelensky and Putin had\ninked a deal already, to another peace agreement. And that the United\nStates and Boris Johnson, the neocons in the White\nHouse and Boris Johnson, over to the Ukraine to\nsabotage that agreement. So what do I think? I think this is a proxy war. I think this is a, you know, this is a war that the neocons\nin the White House wanted. They've said for two decades\nthey wanted this war, and that they wanted to\nuse Ukraine as a pawn, in a proxy war between\nUnited States and Russia, the same as we used Afghanistan. And in fact, they say\nit, this is the model, let's use the Afghanistan model, that was said again and again, and to get the Russians to\noverextend their troops, and then fight them using\nlocal fighters and US weapons. And when President Biden was asked, \"why are we in the Ukraine?\" He was honest, he says,\n\"to depose Vladimir Putin, regime change for Vladimir Putin.\" And when his defense\nsecretary Lloyd Austin, in April, 2022 was asked,\nyou know, \"why are we there?\" He said, \"to degrade the Russians capacity to fight anywhere, to\nexhaust the Russian army, and degrade its capacity to\nfight elsewhere in the world.\" That's not a humanitarian mission. That's not what we were told. We were told this was\nan unprovoked invasion, and that we're there to\nbring a humanitarian relief to the Ukrainians, but\nthat is the opposite. That is a war of attrition\nthat is designed to chew up, to turn this little nation\ninto an abattoir of death, for the flower of Ukrainian youth, in order to advance a\ngeopolitical ambition, of certain people within the White House. And I, you know, I think that's wrong. We should be talking to the\nRussians the way that, you know, Nixon talked to Brezhnev, the way that Bush talked to Gorbachev, the way that my uncle\ntalked to Khrushchev. We need to be talked with the Russians, we should, and negotiating. And we need to be looking about, how do we end this and\npreserve peace in Europe. - Would you as president sit down, and have a conversation\nwith Vladimir Putin, and Vladimir Zelensky separately, and together, to negotiate peace? - Absolutely, absolutely. - What about Vladimir Putin? He's been in power since 2000. So as the old adage goes, \"power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts, absolutely.\" Do you think he has been corrupted, by being in power for so long? If you think of the man,\nif you look at his mind. - Listen, I don't know exactly. I can't say because I just, I don't know enough about\nhim or about, you know, the evidence that I've seen\nis that he is homicidal, he kills his enemies, or poisons them. And you know, the reaction\nI've seen to that, to those accusations from him\nhave not been to deny that. But to kind of laugh it off, I think he's a dangerous man. And that of course, you know, there's probably corruption in his regime. But having said that, it's not our business, to\nchange the Russian government. And anybody who thinks it's a good idea, to do regime change in Russia, which has more nuclear weapons than we do, is, I think, irresponsible. And you know, Vladimir Putin\nhimself has said, you know, \"we will not live in a\nworld without Russia.\" And it was clear when he said that, that he was talking about himself, and he has his hand on a\nbutton that could bring, you know, Armageddon to the entire planet. So why are we messing with this? It's not our job to change that regime. And, we should be making\nfriends with the Russians. We shouldn't be treating him as an enemy. Now we've pushed him\ninto the camp with China. That's not a good thing for our country. And by the way, you know,\nwhat we're doing now, does not appear to be\nweakening Putin at all. Putin now, you know, if\nyou believe the polls, that are coming out of Russia,\nthey show him, you know, the most recent polls\nthat I've seen show him, with an 89% popularity\nthat people in Russia, support the war in Ukraine and that, and they support him as an individual. So, and I understand there's\nproblems with polling, you know, you don't know what to believe, but the polls consistently show that. And, you know, it's\nnot America's business, to be the policeman of the world, and to be changing regimes\nin the world, that's illegal. We shouldn't be breaking\ninternational laws. You know, we should actually be looking for ways to improve\nrelationships with Russia. Not to, you know, not to destroy Russia, not to destroy and not to\nchoose its leadership for them. That's up to the Russian people, not us. - So step one is to\nsit down and empathize, with the leaders of both\nnations to understand their history, their\nconcerns, their hopes. Just to open the door for conversation, so they're not backed into the corner. - Yeah, and I think the US can\nplay a really important role, and a US president can play\na really important role, by reassuring the Russians, that we're not gonna consider\nthem an enemy anymore, that we wanna be friends. And it doesn't mean that you\nhave to let down your guard, completely, the way that you do it, which was the way\nPresident Kennedy did it, is you do it one step at a time. You take baby steps, we\ndo a unilateral move, reduce our, you know, our\nhostility and aggression, and see if the Russians reciprocate. And, that's the way that\nwe should be doing it. And you know, we should be easing our way, into a positive relationship with Russia. We have a lot in common with Russia, and we should be friends with Russia, and with the Russian people. And you know, apparently\nthere's been 350,000 Ukrainians, who have died, at least in this war. And there's probably been\n60 or 80,000 Russians. And that should not give us any joy. It should not give us any, you know, I saw Lindsey Graham\non TV saying, you know, something to the extent that,\n\"anything we can do to kill Russians is a good use of our money.\" It is not, you know, those\nare somebody's children. They're, you know, we should\nhave compassion for them. This war is an unnecessary war. We should settle it through\nnegotiation, through diplomacy, through state graft,\nand not through weapons. - Do you think this\nwar can come to an end, purely through military operations? - No, I mean, no, I don't think\nthere's any way in the world that the Ukrainians can beat the Russians. I don't think there's\nany appetite in Europe. I think Europe is now, you know, in having severe problems\nin Germany, Italy, France, you're seeing these riots, there's internal problems\nin those countries. There is no appetite in Europe, for sending men to die in Ukraine. And the Ukrainians do\nnot have anybody left. The Ukrainians are using\npress gangs, you know, to fill the ranks, their armies, men, military aged men are\ntrying as hard as they can, to get outta the Ukraine right now, to avoid going to the front, the Russians apparently have\nbeen killing Ukrainians, at a seven to one ratio. My son fought over there\nand he told me it's, he had firefights with the\nRussians, mainly at night. But he said most of the battles, were artillery wars during the day. And the Russians now\noutgun the NATO forces, 10 to one in artillery. Oh, they're killing at a horrendous rate. Now, you know, my interpretation\nof what's happened so far, is that, Putin actually went in early on, with a small force because he expected to meet somebody on the other end of a negotiating table\nthat once he went in, and when that didn't happen, they did not have a large enough force, to be able to mount an offensive. And so they've been building\nup that force up till now, and they now have that force. And even against this\nsmall original force, the Ukrainians have been helpless. All of their offenses have died. They've now killed, you know, the head of the Ukrainian special forces, which was the, probably,\narguably, by many accounts, the best elite military\nunit in all of Europe, the commander of that\nSpecial Forces group, had gave a speech about four months ago, saying that 86% of his\nmen are dead or wounded, and cannot return to the front. He cannot rebuild that force. And the troops that are now headed, that are now filling the gaps\nof all those 350,000 men, who have been lost are scantily trained, and they're arriving green at the front. Many of them do not wanna be there. Many of them are giving up and\ngoing over the Russian side. We've seen this again and again and again, including platoon size groups, that are defecting to the Russians. And I don't think it's possible to win. And anybody, (laughs) you know, I saw, of course I've studied World\nWar II history exhaustively, but I saw a, there's a new, I\nthink it's a Netflix series, of documentaries that I highly\nrecommend to people there. They're colorized versions\nof the black and white, films from the battles of World War II but it's all the battles of World War II. So I watched all of that the\nother night, and you know, the willingness of the\nRussians to fight on, against any kind of, and\nto make huge sacrifices, of Russians, the Russians themselves, who were making the\nsacrifice with their lives, the willingness of them to do that, for their motherland is\nalmost inexhaustible. It is incomprehensible\nto think that Ukraine, can beat Russia in a war. It would be like Mexico\nbeating the United States. It's just impossible to\nthink that it can happen. And, you know, Russia has deployed a tiny, tiny fraction of its military so far. And you know, now it has China, with its mass production capacity, supporting its war effort. It's a hopeless situation,\nand we've been lied to, you know, the press in our\ncountry and our government, are just, you know, promoting this lie, that the Ukrainians are about to win, and that everything's going great. And that Putin's on the\nrun, and there's all this wishful thinking because of\nthe Wagner Group, you know- - [Lex] Prigozhin.\n- Prigozhin, and the Wagner Group, that\nthis was an internal coup, and it showed dissent\nand weakness of Putin. And none of that is true. That insurgency, which\nwasn't even an insurgency. He only got 4,000 of his men\nto follow him out of 20,000. And they were quickly stopped. And nobody in the Russian\nmilitary, the oligarchy, the political system, nobody\nsupported it, you know, and but we're being told, \"oh yeah, it's the beginning at the end for Putin. He's weakened, he's wounded,\nhe's on his way out,\" and all of these things are\njust lies that we are being fed. - So to pushback on a\nsmall aspect of this, that you kind of implied. So I've traveled to Ukraine and\none thing that I should say, similar to the Battle of\nStalingrad, it is just not, it is not only the Russians\nthat fight to the end. I think Ukrainian is a very,\nlike to fight to the end. And the morale there is quite high. I've talked to nobody,\nthis was a year ago, in August, in Kherson,\neverybody was proud, to fight and die for their country. And there's some aspect where this war unified the people, gave them a reason, and an understanding that\nthis is what it means, to be Ukrainian and I\nwill fight to the death, to defend this land. - Yeah, you know, I would agree with that, and I should have said that\nmyself at the beginning, that's one of the reasons\nmy son went over there, to fight because, you know,\nhe was inspired by the valor, of the Ukrainian people and, you know, this extraordinary willingness of them. And I think Putin thought\nit would be much easier, to sweep into Ukraine,\nand he found, you know, a stone wall of Ukrainians, ready to put their lives and their bodies on the line. But that to me makes the whole\nepisode even more tragic, is that, you know, I don't believe, I think that the US role in this has been, you know, that there\nwere many opportunities, to settle this war. And the Ukrainians wanted to settle it. Vladimir Zelensky when he ran in 2019. Here's a guy who's a\ncomedian, he's an actor. He had no political experience, and yet he won this election\nwith 70% of the vote, why? He won on a peace platform, and he won promising to\nsign the Minsk accords. And yet something happened\nwhen he got in there, that made him suddenly\npivot, and, you know, I think it's a good guess what happened. I think he was, you know,\nhe came under threat, by ultra nationalists within\nhis own administration, and the insistence of neocons\nlike Victoria Newland, in the White House, that, you know, we don't want peace with\nPutin, we want a war. - Do you worry about nuclear war? - [Robert] Yeah, I worry about it. - [Lex] It seems like a\nsilly question, but it's not, it's a serious question. - Well, the reason it's not, you know, the reason it's not, is because people seem to be in this kind of dream state about\nthat it'll never happen. And yet, you know, it can happen very easily and\nit can happen at any time. And, you know, if we push\nthe Russians too far, you know, I don't doubt that Putin, if he felt like his regime was in, or his nation was in danger, that the United States was\ngonna be able to place, you know, a Quisling on, you know, into the Kremlin that\nhe would use nuclear, you know, torpedoes. And these strategic\nweapons that they have. And that could be it, once you do that, nobody controls the trajectory."

      "section": "JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis",
      "text": "By the way, you know, I\nhave very strong memories, of the Cuban Missile\nCrisis and those 13 days, when we came closer to\nnuclear war, you know, and particularly I think it\nwas when the U2 got shot down, over Cuba, you know, and\nnobody in this country, there's a lot of people in\nWashington DC who at that point, thought that they very\nmay well may wake up dead, that the world may end at night. 30 million Americans killed\n130 million Russians. This is what our military brass wanted. They saw a war with Russia. Nuclear exchange with Russia\nis not only inevitable, but also desirable because\nthey wanted to do it now, while we still had a superiority. - Can you actually go\nthrough the feelings, you've had about the Cuban Missile Crisis? Like what are your memories of it? What are some interesting kind of- - Well, you know, in the middle, I was going to school in Washington, DC, to sit, to our Lady of Victory, which is in Washington DC. So we were, I lived in\nVirginia across Potomac, and we would cross the\nbridge every day into DC, and during the crisis, US\nMarshals came to my house, to take us, I think around day eight. My father was spending the\nnight at the White House. He wasn't coming home, he was staying with the EXCOM\ncommittee and sleeping there. And they were up, you\nknow, 24 hours a day. They were debating and\ntrying to figure out, what was happening. But we had US marshals come\nto our house to take us down. They were gonna take us down\nto White Sulfur Springs, in Southern Virginia, in\nthe Blue Ridge Mountains, where there was an underground city, essentially a bunker that was like a city. And apparently it had McDonald's in it, and a lot of other, you know, it was a full city for the US\ngovernment and their families. US Marshals came to our\nhouse to take us down there. And I was very excited about doing that. And this was at a time, you know, when we were doing the drills, we were doing the duck and\ncover drills once a week, at our school where they would tell you, when the alarms go off, then you put your head onto the table, you take, remove the\nsharps from your desk, put them inside your desk, you put your head onto\nthe table and you wait. And the initial blast,\nwill take the windows, out of the school and\nthen we all stand up, and file in an orderly\nfashion into the basement, where we're gonna be for the next six or eight months or whatever. But in the basement where, you know, we went occasionally in those corridors. were lined with freeze\ndried food canisters up to, from floor to ceiling,\nso people were, you know, we were all preparing for this. And it was, you know, Bob McNamara, who was a friend of mine\nand you know, was my father, one of my father's close\nfriends as Secretary of Defense. He later called it mass psychosis. And my father deeply\nregretted participating in the bomb shelter\nprogram because he said, \"it was part of a\npsychological psyop trick, to teach Americans, that nuclear war was acceptable,\nthat it was survivable.\" And my father, anyway, when\nthe marshals came to our house, take me and my brother Joe away, and we were the ones who\nwere home at that time, my father called and he\ntalked to us on the phone, and he said, \"I don't\nwant you going down there, because if you disappear from school, people are gonna panic. And I need you to be a good\nsoldier and go to school.\" And he said something to\nme during that period, which was that, \"if a nuclear were happen, it would be better to be among the dead, than the living,\" which\nI did not believe, okay. I mean, I had already prepared myself, for the dystopian future. And I knew I could, I spent\nevery day in the woods. I knew that I could survive\nby catching crawfish, and, you know, cooking mud puppies, and do whatever I had to do. But I felt like, okay,\nI could handle this. And I really wanted to see this set up, down in, you know, this underground city. But anyway, that was, you\nknow, part of it for me. My father was away, and you\nknow, the last days of it, my father got this idea, because Khrushchev had sent two letters. He sent one letter that was conciliatory, and then he sent a letter\nthat after his joint chiefs, and the war mongers around him, saw that letter and\nthey disapproved of it. They sent another letter that\nwas extremely belligerent. And my father had the\nidea, let's just pretend, we didn't get the second letter\nand reply to the first one. And then he went down\nto Dobrynin and who was, he met Dobrynin in the Justice Department, and Dobrynin was the Soviet ambassador. And they, you know, they\nproposed this settlement, which was a secret settlement. Eric Khrushchev would withdraw\nthe missiles from Cuba. Khrushchev had put the missiles in Cuba, 'cause we had put missiles,\nyou know, nuclear missiles in Turkey and Italy. And my uncle's secret deal was that if he, if Khrushchev removed\nthe missiles from Cuba, within six months, he would get rid of the\nJupiter missiles in Turkey. But if Khrushchev told anybody\nabout the deal, it was off. So, if news got out about\nthat secret deal, it was off, that was the actual deal and\nKhrushchev complied with it, and then my uncle complied with it. - How much of that part of human history, turned on the decisions of one person? - I think that's one of the, you know, 'cause that of course is the\nperennial question, right? Is history kind of, an automatic pilot and,\nyou know, human decisions, the decisions of leaders\nreally only have, you know, a marginal or incremental bearing, on what is gonna happen, anyway. But I think that is, and historians argue\nabout that all the time. I think that that is\na really good example, of a place in human history that, literally the world could have ended, if we had a different\nleader in the White House. And the reason for that is\nthat there were, as I recall, 64 gun emplacements, you\nknow, missile emplacements. Each one of those missile\nemplacements had a crew, of about a hundred men\nand they were Soviets. So they were, we didn't know whether, we had a couple of questions\nthat my uncle asked, Alan, or asked the CIA. And he asked, Dulles was already gone. But he asked the CIA and he\nasked his military brass, 'cause they all wanted to go\nin, everybody wanted to go in. And my uncle said, my uncle\nasked to see the aerial photos. And he examined those personally, and that's why it's\nimportant to have a leader, in the White House who can push\nback on their bureaucracies. And then he asked them, you know, \"who's manning those missile sites? And are they Russians? And if they're Russians and we bomb them, isn't it gonna force Khrushchev\nto then go into Berlin?\" And that would be the\nbeginning of a cascade effect, that would, you know, highly likely, to have a nuclear confrontation. And the military brass said to my uncle, \"oh, we don't think he'll\nhave the guts to do that.\" So he was, my uncle was like, \"that's what you're betting on?\" And you know, they all\nwanted him to go in, they wanted him to bomb the\nsites and then invade Cuba. And he said, \"if we bomb those sites, we're gonna be killing\nRussians and it's gonna force, it's gonna provoke Russia\ninto some response. And the obvious response is\nfor them to go into Berlin.\" Oh, but the thing that\nwe didn't know then, that we didn't find out\nuntil, I think, you know, it was like a 30 year anniversary, of the Cuban Missile Crisis in Havana. And what we learned then was that, from the Russians, who came to that event, it was like a symposium where everybody on both sides talked about it. And we learned a lot of stuff that never, nobody knew before. One of the insane things,\nthe most insane thing, that we learned was that\nthe weapons were already, the nuclear warheads\nwere already in place. They were ready to fire. And that the authorization to fire, was made, was delegated, to\neach of the gun crew commanders. So there were 60 people who\nhad all had authorization, to fire if they felt\nthemselves under attack. So you have to believe, that at least one of\nthem, would've launched, and that would've been\nthe beginning of the end. And, you know, if anybody had launched, you know, we knew what would happen. My uncle knew what would happen, 'cause he asked again and\nagain, \"what's gonna happen?\" And they said, \"30 million\nAmericans will be killed, but we will kill 130 million\nRussians, so we will win.\" And that was a victory for them. And my uncle said later said, he told Arthur Schlesinger\nand Kenny O'Donnell, he said, those guys, he called 'em the salad brass, the guys with all of this\nstuff on their chest. And he said, \"those guys, they don't care, 'cause they\nknow that if it happens, that they're gonna be in\nthe charge of everything, they're the ones who are gonna be running the world after that.\" So for them, you know, it\nwas, there was an incentive, to kill 130 million Russians,\nand 30 million Americans. But my uncle, he had this correspondence, with the Khrushchev. They were secretly\ncorresponding with each other. And that is what saved the world, is that they had, that both\nof them had been men of war. You know, Eisenhower famously said, \"it will not be a man of war. It will not be a soldier,\nwho starts World War III,\" 'cause a guy who's actually\nseen it, knows how bad it is. And my uncle, you know, had been in the heat of the South Pacific, his boat would've been cut\ninto by a Japanese destroyer. Many of three of his\ncrewmen have been killed. One of 'em badly burned. He pulled that guy with\na lanyard in his teeth, six miles to an island in\nthe middle of the night. And then they hid out there for 10 days. You know, and he came back, like I said, he was the only president\nof the United States, that earned in the Purple Heart. Meanwhile, Khrushchev\nhad been at Stalingrad, which was the worst place to\nbe on the planet, you know, probably in the 20th century,\nother than, you know, in Auschwitz or one of the death camps. It was, you know, it\nwas the most ferocious, horrific war with people starving people, committed cannibalism,\nyou know, eating the dogs, the cats, eating their shoe leather, or easing to death by\nthe thousands, et cetera. Khrushchev did not want, the\nlast thing he wanted was a war. And the last thing my\nuncle wanted was war. But the CIA did not know\nanything about Khrushchev. And the reason for that, is there was a mole at Langley, so that every time the CIA\ngot a spy in the Kremlin, he would immediately be killed. So they had no eyes in the Kremlin. You know, there were literally hundreds, of Russians spies who had, who had defected the United\nStates and were in the Kremlin, who were killed during that period. They had no idea anything\nabout Khrushchev, about how he saw the world. And they saw the Kremlin\nitself as a monolith. You know, that this kind of, you know, the same way that we look at Putin today, they have this ambition of world conquest, and it's driving them, and there's nothing else they think about. They're absolutely single-minded about it. But actually there was a big\ndivision between Khrushchev, and his joint chiefs and\nhis intelligence apparatus. And they both at one point discovered, they were both in the same situation. They were surrounded by\nspies and military personnel, who were intent on going to war. And they were the two guys resisting it. So when my uncle had\nthis idea of, you know, being the peace president\nfrom the beginning, he told Ben Bradley, one\nof his best friends who, you know, was the publisher\nof the Washington Post, the editor-in-chief at that time. He said, Ben Bradley asked him, \"what do you want on your gravestone?\" And my uncle said, \"he kept the peace.\" He said, \"the principle\njob of the president of the United States is to keep\nthe country out of war.\" And, so when he first became president, he actually agreed to\nmeet Khrushchev in Geneva, to do his summit, and by the way, Eisenhower wanted to do the same thing. Eisenhower wanted peace, and he was gonna meet in Vienna. But that peace summit was blown up. He was gonna try to do, you know, he was gonna try to end the Cold War. Eisenhower was in the last\nyear of his, in May of 1968. But that was torpedoed by\nthe CIA, during the U2 crash. You know, they sent a U2\nover the Soviet Union. It got shot down, and then they told, and then Alan Dulles, told Eisenhower, to deny that we had a program. They didn't know that the Russians had captured Gary Francis Powers. And that blew up the peace talks, between Eisenhower and Khrushchev. And so, you know, there\nwas a lot of tension. My uncle wanted to break that tension. He agreed to meet, with\nKhrushchev in Vienna, early on in his term. He went over there and\nKhrushchev snubbed him. Khrushchev lectured him, imperiously, about the terror of American imperialism, and rebuffed any, you know, they did agree not to go into Laos. They made an agreement that\nkept the United States, kept my uncle from sending troops to Laos, but it had been a disaster, Vienna. So then we had a spy that\nused to come to our house, all the time, a guy\ncalled Georgi Bolshakov, and he was this Russian spy. My parents had met at the embassy. They had gone to a party or a reception, at the Russian Embassy. And he had approached them, and they knew he was GRU agent and KGB. He was both, oh, he used\nto come to our house. They really liked him,\nhe was very attractive. He was always laughing and joking. He would do rope climbing\ncontests with my father. He would do pushup\ncontests with my father. He could do the Russian\ndancing, the Cossacks dancing. And he would do that for\nus and teach us that. And we knew he was a spy too. And this was at the time of, you know, the James Bond films\nwere first coming out. So it was really exciting for us, to have a actual Russian spy in our house. (Lex laughs) The State Department was horrified by it. - [Lex] Yeah. - But anyway, when\nKhrushchev, after Vienna, and after, you know, the Bay of Pigs, Khrushchev had second thoughts\nand he sent this long letter, to my uncle, and he\ndidn't wanna go through his state department or his embassy. He wanted to Enron them, and\nhe was friends with Bolshakov, so he gave Georgi the letter,\nand Georgi brought it, and handed it to Pierre Salinger, folded in the New York Times. And he gave it to my uncle. And it was this beautiful\nletter, which he said, you know, my uncle had talked to\nhim about the children, who were played, you know, how we played, 29 grandchildren, who were playing in his yard. And he's saying, \"what is our moral basis, for making a decision that\ncould kill these children? So they'll never write a poem, they'll never participate in election, they'll never run for office. How can we morally make a decision, that is going to eliminate\nlife for these beautiful kids?\" And he had said that to Khrushchev. And Khrushchev wrote\nthem this letter back, saying that he was now\nsitting at this dacha, on the Black Sea. And that he was thinking about, what my Uncle Jack had\nsaid to him at Vienna. And he regretted very\ndeeply, not having taken the olive leaf that Jack\nhad all offered him. And then he said, you\nknow, \"it occurs to me now, that we're all on an ark, and that there is not another one. And that the entire fate of the planet, and all of it's creatures\nand all of the children, are dependent on the decisions we make. And you and I have a moral obligation, to go forward with each other as friends.\" And immediately after\nthat, this was, you know, he sent that right after\nthe Berlin crisis in 1962, General Curtis LeMay tried to, had tried to provoke a war, with an incident at Checkpoint Charlie, which was the May, the entrance. The entrance exit, through\nthe Berlin Wall, in Berlin. And the Russian tanks\nhad come to the wall, the US tanks had come to the\nwall, and there was a standoff. And my uncle, had sent\na message to Khrushchev, and through Dobrynin saying,\n\"my back is at the wall. I cannot, I have no place\nto back, please back off. And then we will back off.\" And Khrushchev took his word,\nbacked his tanks off first, and then my uncle ordered LeMay to back. He had, LeMay had mounted bulldozer plows, on the front of the tanks to\nplow down the Berlin wall. And the Russians had come. So it was just, you know, it was his generals\ntrying to provoke a war. But they started talking\nto each other then. And then after he wrote that letter, they agreed that they\nwould install a hotline, so they could talk to each other, and they wouldn't have to\ngo through intermediaries. And so at Jack's house on the Cape, there was a red phone that\nwe knew if we picked it up, Khrushchev would answer. And there was another\none in the White House. - [Lex] Yeah. - But they knew it was\nimportant to talk to each other, you know, and you just wish, that we had that kind of leadership today, that can I, you know, that\njust understands our job. Look, I know you know\na lot about AI, right? And you know, how dangerous\nit is potentially, to humanity and what opportunities, it also, you know, offers. But it could kill us all. I mean, Elon said, \"first\nis gonna steal our job, then it's gonna kill us, right?\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And it's probably not hyperbole. It actually, you know, if it follows the laws of biological evolution, which are just the laws of mathematics, that's probably a good endpoint for it. You know, a potential endpoint. So it's gonna happen,\nbut we need to make sure it's regulated and it's\nregulated properly, for safety in every country. And, that includes Russia\nand China and Iran. Right now, we should be putting\nall the weapons of war aside and sitting down with\nthose guys and saying, \"how are we doing? How are we gonna do this?\" There's much more important things to do. This stuff is gonna kill us, if we don't figure out how to regulate it. And leadership needs to\nlook down the road at what, what is the real risk here? And the real risk is\nthat, you know, AI will, enslave us for one thing, you know, and then destroy us and\ndo all this other stuff. And how about biological weapons? We're now all working on\nthese biological weapons, and we're doing biological\nweapons from Ebola, you know, dengue fever and, you know, all of these other bad things. And we're making ethnic bio weapons, bio weapons that can only kill Russians, bio weapons that the Chinese\nare making that, you know, can kill people who\ndon't have Chinese genes. So all of this is now within\nreach, we're actively doing it, and we need to stop it. And we can easily, a\nbiological weapons treaty, is the easiest thing in the world to do. We can verify it, we can enforce it, and everybody wants to agree to it. Only insane people do not wanna, wanna continue this kind of research. There's no reason to do it. So there are these existential\nthreats to all of humanity, now out there, like AI and\npolitical, biological weapons. We need to star stop fighting each other, start competing on economic game fields, playing fields, instead of\nmilitary playing fields, which will be good for all of humanity. And that we need to sit\ndown with each other, and negotiate reasonable\ntreaties on how we regulate AI, and biological weapons. And nobody's talking about this, in this political race right now. Nobody's talking about it in a government. They get fixated on these\nlittle wars, you know, and these comic book\ndepictions of good versus evil, you know, and we all go, you know, hoorah, and go off to and give them\nthe weapons and enrich, you know, the military and Joshua complex, but we're on the road to\nperdition if we don't end this. - And some of this requires\nto have this kind of, phone that connects Khrushchev\nand John F. Kennedy, that cuts through all the bureaucracy. - [Robert] Yeah. - To have this communication, between heads of state\nand in the case of AI, perhaps heads of tech companies, where you can just pick up the phone, and have a conversation.\n- [Robert] Yes. - Because a lot of it, a lot of the existential threats\nof artificial intelligence, perhaps even bio weapons,\nis unintentional. It's not even strategic\nintentional effects. So you have to be\ntransparent and honest about, especially with AI, that\npeople might not know, what's the worst that's going to happen, once you release it out into the wild. And you have to have an\nhonest communication, about how to do it so that\ncompanies are not terrified of regulation, overreach of regulation. And then government is not\nterrified of tech companies, of manipulating them in some\ndirect or indirect ways. So like, there's a trust that\nbuilds, versus a distrust. That seems to, so\nbasically, that old phone, where Khrushchev can call\nJohn F. Kennedy is needed. - Yeah, and you know,\nI don't think there's, listen, I don't understand AI, okay. I do know, I can see\nfrom all this technology, how it's this kind of key totalitarianism, that once you put these\nsystems in place, you know, they can be misused to enslave people, and they can be misused in wars and, to subjugate, to kill, to\ndo all of these bad things. And I don't think there's anybody, on Capitol Hill who understands this. You know, we need to bring in\nthe tech community and say, \"tell us what these\nregulations need to look like,\" you know, so that there\ncan be freedom to innovate, so that we can milk AI for\nall of the good things, but not, you know, fall into\nthese traps that are gonna, you know, that are these\nexistential threats, that pose existential threats to humanity."

The salad brass and\ninstitutions like the CIA. So that makes it particularly\ntragic that he was killed. To what degree was CIA involved, or the various bureaucracy,\ninvolved in his death? - The evidence that the CIA was involved in my uncle's murder, and that they were subsequently\ninvolved in the coverup, and continue to be involved\nin the coverup, I mean, there's still 5,000 documents\nthat they won't release, you know, 60 years later is, I think, so insurmountable. And so, you know, mountainous\nand overwhelming that I, it's beyond any reasonable\ndoubt, including, you know, dozens of confessions of\npeople who were involved, in the assassination. But, you know, every kind of document, it came as a surprise\nrecently, to most Americans. I think the release of\nthese documents in which, the press, the American media, finally acknowledged that, yeah, Lee Harvey Oswald was the CIA asset, that he was recruited, you know, in 1957, he was Marine working at\nthe Tsui Air Force base, which was the CIA Air\nForce base in, you know, with the U2 flights,\nwhich was a CIA program. And that he was recruited\nby James Jesus Angleton, who was the director\nof counterintelligence, and then sent on a fake\ndefection to Russia, and then brought back,\nyou know, to Dallas. And people didn't know that even though, it's been known for decades. It never percolated into\nthe mainstream media, because they have such a, they have such an allergy to anything, that challenges the Warren Report. You know, when Congress\ninvestigated my uncle's murder, in the 1970s, the church committee did, and they did, you know, two\nand a half year investigation, and they had many, many more documents, and much more testimony available, to them than the Warren Commission had. And this was a decade after\nthe Warren Commission. They came to the conclusion, that my uncle was killed by a conspiracy. And there was a division\nwhere, essentially, one guy on that committee believed, it was primarily the mafia. But Richard Schweitzer, who was the senator head\nof the committee, said, straight out, \"the CIA\nwas involved in the murder of the President of the United States.\" So, and I've talked to most of\nthe staff on that committee, and they said, \"yeah, and the CIA was stonewalling us\nthe whole way through.\" And the actual people\nthat the CIA appointed, George Johan, who the CIA\nappointed as a liaison, to the committee, they\nbrought him out of retirement. He had been one of the\nmasterminds of the assassination. Oh, there's no, I mean, it's\nimpossible to even talk about, a tiny, the fraction of the evidence here. What I suggest to people, there are hundreds of\nbooks written about this, that, you know, assemble this evidence, and mobilize the evidence. The best book to me for people to read, is James Douglass's book, which\nis called \"The Unspeakable.\" And he, Douglass does this extraordinary, he is an extraordinary scholar, and he does this just an\namazing job of digesting, and summarizing and\nmobilizing all of them. You know, the probably a\nmillion documents and you know, the evidence from all these\nconfessions that have come out, into a coherent story,\nand it's riveting to read. And, you know, I recommend\npeople who do not take my word for it, you know, and don't\ntake anybody else's word, go ahead and do the research yourself. And one way to do that is, is probably the most efficient way, is to read Douglass's book. Because he has all the references there. - So if it's true that CIA had\na hand in this assassination, how is it possible for them\nto amass so much power? How is it possible for\nthem to become corrupt? And is it individuals or is\nit the entire institution? - No, it's not the entire institution. My daughter-in-law who's\nhelping to run my campaign, was a CIA, you know, in\nthe Clandestine services, for all her career. She was at Spy and Weapons\nof Mass Destruction program, in the Mid East and in China. And there's 22,000 people\nwho worked for the CIA. Probably 20,000 of those are, you know, are patriotic Americans and\nreally good public servants, and they're doing important\nwork for our country. But the institution is corrupt, and because the higher ranks\nthe institution, and in fact, Mike Pompeo said something\nlike this to me the other day, who was the director of the CIA. He said, \"when I was there, I did not do a good job of\ncleaning up that agency.\" And he said, \"the entire\nupper bureaucracy, of that agency are\npeople who do not believe in the institutions of democracy.\" This is what he said to me. So I don't know if that's\ntrue, but I know that, you know, that's significant. He's a smart person and he ran the agency, and he was the Secretary of State. But it's no mystery how that happened. We know the history. The CIA was originally, first of all, there was great reluctance\nin 1947 that we had, for the first time we\nhad a secret spy agency, in this country during\nWorld War II called the OSS. That was disbanded after the\nwar because Congress said, \"having a secret spy agency, is incompatible with a democracy.\" Secret spy agencies are\nthings that like the KGB the Stasi, East Germany,\nSlovakia and Iran, and Peep and Chile and whatever, you know, all over the world, they're all have to do with\ntotalitarian governments. They're not something\nthat you can have that, it's antithetical to\ndemocracy to have that. But... In 1947, we created, Truman signed it in, but it was initially, an espionage agency, which means information\ngathering, which is important. It's to gather and consolidate\ninformation from many, many different sources\nfrom all over the world. And then put those in reports, of the White House so the President, can make good decisions\nbased upon valid information, evidence-based, you know, decision making. But Alan Dulles, who was the, essentially the first head of the agency, made a series of legislative machinations, and political imaginations\nthat gave additional powers, to the agency and opened up the, what they called then, the plans division, which is, the plans division\nis the dirty tricks. It's the black ops fixing elections, murdering, what they\ncall executive action, which means killing foreign\nleaders and, you know, making small wars and bribing, and blackmailing people\nstealing elections, and that kind of thing. And the reason at that time, you know, we were in the middle of\nthe Cold War and Truman, and then Eisenhower did\nnot wanna go to war. They didn't wanna commit troops. And it seemed to them that, you know, this was a way of kind of\nfighting the Cold War secretly, without, and doing it at minimal cost, by changing events sort of invisibly. And so it was seductive to\nthem, but everybody, you know, Congress, when they\nfirst voted it in place, Congress, both political parties said, \"if we create this thing, it\ncould turn into a monster, and it could undermine our values.\" And today they, it's so powerful, and then nobody knows what its budget is. Plus it has its own\ninvestment fund, In-Q-Tel, which has invested, you know, made I think, 2,000\ninvestments in Silicon Valley. So it has ownership of a\nlot of these tech companies, that, you know, a lot of the\nCEOs of those tech companies, have signed state secrecy\nagreements with the CIA, which if they even reveal\nthat they have signed that, they can go to jail for 20 years, and have their assets removed, et cetera. The influence that the agency has, the capacity to influence\nevents at every level, in our country, is really frightening. And then, for most of its life,"

      "text": "the CIA was banned from\npropagandizing Americans, but we learned that they\nwere doing it anyway. So in 1973, during the\nchurch committee hearings, we learned that the CIA had a program, called Operation Mockingbird, where they had at least 400 members, leading members of the\nUnited States Press Corps, on the New York Times,\nthe Washington Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, et cetera, who were secretly working for the agency, and steering news coverage\nto support CIA priorities. And they agreed at that time, to disband Operation Mockingbird in '73. But there's indications\nthey didn't do that. And they still, the CIA today, is the biggest funder of\njournalism around the world. The biggest funder is through USAID, the USA, the United\nStates funds journalism, in almost every country in the world. You know, it owns newspapers,\nit has journalists on it, thousands and thousands of\njournalists on its payroll. They're not supposed to be\ndoing that in the United States. But, you know, in 2016,\nPresident Obama changed the law, to make it legal now for the\nCIA to propagandize Americans. And I think, you know, we\ncan't look at the Ukraine war, and how that was, you know, has been how the\nnarrative has been formed, in the minds of Americans, and say that the CIA had\nnothing to do with that. - Well, what is the\nmechanism by which the CIA, influences the narrative, do you think? It's indirectly? - [Robert] Through the press. - Indirectly through the press, or directly by funding the press? - Directly through, I mean, there's certain press organs\nthat have been linked, you know, to the agency that the people who run those organs,\nthings like the Daily Beast, now Rolling Stone, you know,\neditor of Rolling Stone, Noah Shachtman has deep relationships, with the intelligence\ncommunity Salon, Daily Coasts. - But I wonder why they would do it. So from my perspective,\nit just seems like the job of a journalist is to have an integrity, where your opinion cannot\nbe influenced or bought. - I agree with you, but I actually think, that the entire field of\njournalism has, you know, really ashamed itself\nin recent years because, it's become, the principle of\nnewspapers in this country, and the television\nstation, the legacy media, have abandoned their traditional, their tradition of, which\nwas when I was a kid, my house was filled with the\ngreatest journalists alive, at that time, people like Ben\nBradley, like Anthony Lewis, Mary McLeod, Pete Hamill, Jack Newfield, Jimmy Breslin, and many, many others. And, after my father died, they started the RFK Journalism Awards, to recognize integrity\nand courage, you know, journalistic integrity and courage. And for that generation of journalism, they thought, they believed, that the function of journalists, was to maintain this posture of fear, skepticism toward any\naggregation of power, and including government\nauthority, that you always, that people in authority lie, and they always have to be questioned. And that their job was\nto speak truth to power, and to be guardians of\nthe First Amendment right, to the free expression. But if you look, what\nhappened during the pandemic, was the inverse of that\nkind of journalism where, the major press organs\nin this country were, instead of speaking truth to power, they were doing the opposite. They were broadcasting propaganda. They became propaganda organs\nfor the government agencies. And they were actually\ncensoring the speech of dissent, anybody who dissents of the powerless. Oh, and in fact, it was\nan organized conspiracy, you know, the name of it was\nthe Trusted News Initiative. And, some of the major\npress organs in our country, signed onto it, and they\nagreed not to print stories, or facts that departed\nfrom government orthodoxy. So the Washington Post was\na signature of the UPI, the AP and then the four media, or the four social media groups, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, and Google, all signed on to the\nTrusted News Initiative. It was started by the\nBBC, organized by them. And the purpose of it\nwas to make sure nobody could print anything about government, that departed from government orthodox, and the way it worked\nis the UPI and the AP, which are the news services\nthat provide most of the news, you know, news around the country. And the Washington Post would decide, what news was permissible to print. And a lot of it was about COVID, but also Hunter Biden's laptops. Where it was the impermissible to suggest, that those were real or that, you know, they had stuff on there\nthat was compromising. And, you know, and by the way, what I'm telling you\nis all well documented, and I'm litigating on it right now, so I'm part of a lawsuit against the DNI. And so I know a lot about what happened, and I have all this documented, and people can go to our website. There's a letter on my Substack now, to Michael Cher of the\nWashington Post that outlines all this and gives all my sources, because Michael Cher accused me, of being a conspiracy theorist, when he was actually part of a conspiracy, a true conspiracy, to suppress anybody, who was departing from\ngovernment orthodoxies, by either censoring them completely, or labeling them conspiracy theorists. - I mean, you can understand\nthe intention and the action, the difference between,\nas we talked about, you can understand the intention\nof such a thing being good, that in a time of a catastrophe\nand a time of a pandemic, there's a lot of risk\nto saying untrue things. But that's a slippery\nslope that leads into- - [Robert] Yeah. - A place where the\njournalistic integrity, that we talked about is\ncompletely sacrificed. And then you can deviate from truth. - If you read their internal memorandum, including the statements of the leader, of the Trusted News Initiative, I think her name's Jennifer Cecil, you know, you can go on our\nwebsite and see her statement. And she says, \"the purpose\nof this is that we're now,\" actually, she says,\n\"when people look at us, they think we're\ncompetitors, but we're not. The real competitors are\ncoming from all these, alternative news sources\nnow all over the network, and they're hurting public trust in us, and they're hurting our economic model. And they have to be\nchoked off and crushed. And the way that we're gonna\ndo that is to make an agreement with the social media\nsites that if we say, if we label their\ninformation misinformation, the social media sites will deplatform it, or they will throttle it,\nor they will shadow ban it,\" which destroys the economic model, of those alternative competitive\nsources of information. So that's true. But the point you make\nis an important point, that the journalists themselves, who probably didn't know\nabout the TNI agreement, certainly, I'm sure they didn't, they believe that they're\ndoing the right thing, by suppressing information\nthat may challenge, you know, government\nproclamations on COVID. But I mean, there's a danger to that. And the danger is that, you know, once you appoint yourself an arbiter, of what's true and what's not true, then there's really no end\nto the power that you have now assumed for yourself. Because now, your job is no\nlonger to inform the public. Your job now is to manipulate the public. And if you end up manipulating the public, in collusion with powerful entities, then you become the instrument\nof authoritarian rule, rather than the, you\nknow, the opponent of it. And it becomes the inverse of\njournalism and a democracy."

      "text": "- You're running for\npresident as a Democrat. What to you are the strongest\nvalues that represent the left wing politics of this country? - I would say protection\nof the environment, and the commons, you know,\nthe air, the water, wildlife, fisheries, public lands,\nyou know, those assets, they cannot be reduced to\nprivate property, ownership. You know, the landscapes,\nour Purple Mountain Majesty, the protection of the most\nvulnerable people in our society. People who, which would include\nchildren and minorities, the restoration of the\nmiddle class, you know, and protection of labor, dignity, and decent pay for labor. Bodily autonomy, a\nwoman's right to choose, or an individual's right to endure, unwanted medical procedures. Peace. You know, the Democrats\nhave always been anti-war. That the refusal to use\nfear is a governing tool. FDR said, \"the only thing we\nhave to fear is fear itself.\" 'Cause he recognized that\ntyrants and dictators, could use fear to disable\ncritical thinking, and overwhelm the desire\nfor personal liberty. The freedom of government\nfrom untoward influence, by corrupt corporate power, is the end of this corrupt merger, of state and corporate\npower that is now, I think, dominating our democracy. What Eisenhower warned about, when he warned against the emergence, of the military industrial complex. And then I prefer to talk about kind of, the positive revision of\nwhat we should be doing, in our country and globally,\nwhich is, you know, I see that the corporations\nare commoditizing us, or poisoning our children, or strip mining the wealth\nfrom our middle class, and treating America as if it\nwere business and liquidation, converting assets to cash\nas quickly as possible. And, you know, and creating\nor exacerbating this, this huge disparity in\nwealth in our country, which is eliminating the\nmiddle class and creating, you know, kind of a Latin\nAmerican style feudal model. There's these huge\naggregations of wealth above, and widespread poverty below. And that's a configuration\nthat is too unstable, to support democracy sustainably. You know, and we're supposed\nto be modeling democracy, but we're losing it. And I think we have ought\nto have a foreign policy, that restores our moral\nauthority around the world. Restores America as the\nembodiment of moral authority, in which it was when\nmy uncle was president. And as a purveyor of peace rather than, you know, a war like nation. My uncle said he didn't\nwant people in Africa, and Latin America and Asia, when they think of\nAmerica to picture a man, with a gun and a bayonet. He wanted them to think of\na Peace Corps volunteer. And he refused to send\ncombat veterans abroad, combat soldiers abroad. He never sent a single\nsoldier to his death abroad. And in, you know, into combat. He sent 16,000, he\nresisted, in Berlin in '62. He resisted in Laos. In '61, he resisted in Vietnam, you know, Vietnam, they wanted him\nto put 250,000 troops. He only put 16,000 advisors, which was fewer troops. And he sent to get James Meredith, into Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi. One Black man, he sent 16,000\nand a month before he died, he'd ordered them all home. He actually, I think it\nwas October 2nd, 1963, he heard that a Green Beret had died. And he asked his aid for a combat, for a list of combat fatalities. And the aid came back\nand there was 75 men, had died in Vietnam at that point. And he said, \"that's too many. We're gonna have no more.\" And he ordered, he signed\na national security order, 263, and ordered all of those men, all Americans home from Vietnam by 1965, with the first thousand\ncoming home by December '63. And then in November, he, of course, just before that evacuation\nbegan, he was killed. And a week later, President\nJohnson remanded that order. And then a year after that,\nthe Tonkin Gulf resolution, we sent 250,000, which is what they wanted my uncle to do, which he refused. And then, and it became an American war. And then Nixon, you know,\ntopped it off at 560,000, 56,000 Americans never came home, including my cousin George Skagel, who died at the Ted Offensive. And we killed a million Vietnamese, and we got nothing for it. - So America should be\nthe symbol of peace. - And you know, today, my uncle, you know, really focused on putting\nAmerica on the side of the poor. - [Lex] Yeah. - Instead of our tradition of, you know, of fortifying oligarchies\nthat were anti-communism. That was our major criteria, if you said you were against communists, and of course the people\nwere the rich people. Our aid was going to the rich\npeople in those countries, and they were going to the military juntas our weapons were going to the juntas, to fight against the poor. And my uncle said, \"no, you know, America should be on\nthe side of the poor.\" And so he launched the Alliance\nfor Progress and USAID, which were intended to bring\naid to the poorest people in those and build middle classes, and take ourselves away. In fact, his most, his favorite trip, his two favorite trips\nwhile he was president, his most favorite trip was to Ireland, this incredible emotional homecoming, for all of the people of Ireland. But his second favorite trip\nwas when he went to Columbia, he went to Latin America, but Columbia was his favorite country. And there were, I think\nthere were 2 million people, came into Bogota to see\nhim, this vast crowd. And they were just\ndelirious, cheering for him. And the president of Columbia,\nAlberto Lleras Camargo, said to him, \"do you\nknow why they love you?\" And my uncle said, \"why?\" And he said, \"'cause they\nthink you've put America, on the side of the poor,\nagainst the oligarchs.\" And you know, when my\nuncle, after he died, today, there are more\navenues and boulevards, and hospitals and schools named, and statues, named after\nand commemorating in parks, commemorating John Kennedy\nin Africa and Latin America, than any other president\nin the United States, and probably more than all\nthe other presidents combined. And it's because, you know, he put America on the side of the poor. And that's what we ought to be doing. We ought to be projecting\neconomic power abroad, the Chinese have essentially\nstolen his playbook. And you know, we've spent\n$8 trillion on the Iraq war, in its aftermath of wars in Syria, Yemen, Libya, you know, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and what do we get for that? We got nothing, for that money. $8 trillion we got, we killed more Iraqis, than Saddam Hussein. Iraq today is much worse off, than it was when Saddam was there. It's an incoherent violent war, between Shia and Sunni death squads. We pushed Iraq into the embrace of Iran. It's now become essentially\na proxy for Iran, which is exactly the outcome, that we were trying to prevent\nfor the past, you know, 20 or 30 years, we created ISIS, we sent 2 million refugees into Europe, destabilizing all of the nations\nin Europe for generations. And we're now seeing\nthese riots, in France. And that's a direct result\nfrom the Syrian war, that we created, and our creation of ISIS. Brexit is another, you\nknow, result of that. So we, for $8 trillion,\nwe wrecked the world. And during that same period\nthat we spent $8.1 trillion, bombing bridges, ports,\nschools, hospitals, that the Chinese spent $8.1\ntrillion building schools, ports, hospitals,\nbridges, and universities. And now, you know, the Chinese, are out competing us\neverywhere in the world. Everybody wants to deal\nwith the Chinese because, they, you know, they come in, they build nice things for you, and there's no strengths attached, and they're pleasant to deal with. And, you know, as a result of that, Brazil is switching to Chinese currency, Argentina is switching, Saudi Arabia, our greatest partner that,\nyou know, we put trillions of dollars into protecting\nour oil pipelines there. And now they're saying, you know, \"we don't care what the\nUnited States think.\" That's what Mohammed bin Salman said. He said, \"we don't,\" you know, he dropped oil production in Saudi Arabia, in the middle of a US inflation spiral. They've never done that to us before, to aggravate the inflation spiral. And two weeks later, and\nthen they signed a deal, a unilateral peace deal with Iran, which has been the enemy that\nwe've been telling them to, you know, to be a bulwark\nagainst for 20 years. And two weeks after that, he said, \"we don't care what the\nUnited States thinks anymore.\" So that's what we got for spending all those trillions of dollars there. We got short term friends and\nthe United States, you know, policy abroad, and we have\nnot made ourselves safer. We've made Americans, we've\nput Americans in more jeopardy, all over the world. You know, you have to wait\nin lines to get through the airport and you have to, you know, the security state is now\ncosting us $1.3 trillion, and America is unsafer and\npoorer than it's ever been. So, you know, we're not getting, we should be doing what President Kennedy said we ought to do. And what China, the policy\nthat China has now adopted. - So that's a really eloquent\nand clear and powerful, description of the way\nyou see US should be doing geopolitics and the way you see, US should be taking care of\nthe poor in this country."

What is good that he\nhas done for the world, especially during this pandemic? - You know, I don't want to\nsit here and speak unfairly, by saying the guy didn't do anything, but I don't, I can't think of anything. I mean, if you tell me\nsomething that you think he did, you know, maybe there was\na drug that got licensed, while he was at NIH that,\nyou know, benefited people. That's certainly possible. He was there for 50 years and, in terms of of his principal programs, of the AIDS programs\nand his COVID programs, and I think that the harm\nthat he did vastly outweighs you know, the benefits. - Do you think he believes\nhe's doing good for the world? - I don't know what he believes. In fact, in that book, which\nis I think 250,000 words, I never try to look inside of his head. I deal with facts, I deal with science. So, and every factual\nassertion in that book, is cited and source to\ngovernment databases, or peer reviewed publications. And, I don't, I try not\nto speculate about things, that I don't know about or I can't prove. And I cannot tell you\nwhat his motivations were, or I mean, all of us. He's done a thing. A lot of things that I\nthink are really very, very bad things for\nhumanity, very deceptive. But we all have this\ncapacity for self deception. As I said, at the\nbeginning of this podcast, we judge ourselves on our intentions, rather than our actions.

And, you know, not\neverybody kind of lives, an examined life and is\nexamining their motivations, and the way that the\nworld might experience their professions of goodness. - Let me ask about the\ndifficulty of the job he had. Do you think it's possible\nto do that kind of job well, or is it also a fundamental\nflaw of the job, of being the centralized figure, that's supposed to a scientific policy? - No, no.

John Anthony Morris,\nmany people whose careers he destroyed because they\nwere trying to tell the truth. One after the other. The greatest scientists\nin the history of NIH, were run out of that\norganization, out of that agency. But, you know, people listening to this, probably, you know, will,\nin hearing me say that, will think that I'm bitter or that, I'm doctrinaire about him, but you know, you should really go and read my book.

Collectively, those companies\nhave paid $35 billion, in criminal penalties and\ndamages in the last decade. And I think since 2,000, about 79 billion. So these are the most corrupt\ncompanies in the world. And the problem is that\nthey're serial felons. They, you know, they do this\nagain and again and again. So they did Vioxx, you\nknow, Merck did Vioxx, which Vioxx, they killed\npeople by falsifying science. And they did it, they lied to the public. They said, this is a headache medicine, and a arthritis painkiller. But they didn't tell people that, it also gave you heart attacks. And they knew, you know,\nwe've found when we sued them, you know, the memos from\ntheir bean counters saying, \"we're gonna kill this many people, but we're still going to make money.\" So they make those calculations, and those calculations are\nmade very, very regularly. And then, you know, when they get caught, they pay a penalty. And I think they paid\nabout $7 billion for Vioxx, but then they went right\nback that same year, that they paid that penalty, they went back into the same\nthing again with Gardasil, and with a whole lot of other drugs. So the way that the system is set up, the way that it's sold to doctors, the way that, nobody ever goes to jail. So there's really no penalty that, it all becomes part of the\ncost of doing business. And you know, you can see other businesses\nthat if they're not, if there's no penalty, if there's no real, I mean these, look, these are the companies, that gave us the opioid epidemic, right? So they knew what was gonna\nhappen and we, you know, you go and see, there's a documentary, I forget what the name of it is, but it shows exactly what happened. And, you know, they corrupted FDA, they knew that this, that\noxycodone was addictive. They got FDA to tell doctors\nthat it wasn't addictive. They pressured FDA to lie. And they got their way. And they've, so far they\nled this year, you know, they got a whole generation\naddicted to oxycodone. And now, you know, when they\ngot caught and they made it, we made it harder to get oxycodone. And now all those addicted kids, are going to fentanyl and dying. And this year it killed 106,000. That's twice as many\npeople who were killed, during the 20 year Vietnam War. But in one year, twice many American kids. And they knew it was gonna happen, and they did it to make money. So I don't know what you\ncall that, other than saying, that's, you know, a criminal enterprise. - Or is it possible to have,\nwithin a capitalist system, to produce medication, to produce drugs at scale in a way that is not corrupt? - Of course it is. - [Lex] How? - Through, you know, through\na solid regulatory regimen, you know, where drugs are actually tested. You know, I mean the problem\nis, not the capitalist system, the capitalist system, you know, I have great admiration for that. Love the capitalist system, it's the greatest economic\nengine ever devised. But it has to be harnessed\nto a social purpose. Otherwise it's gonna,\nit leads us, you know, down the trail of oligarchy\nenvironmental destruction, you know, and commoditizing, poisoning, and killing human beings. That's what it will do, in the end. You need a regulatory structure, that is not corrupted by entanglements, financial entanglements with the industry. And we've set this up,\nthe way that this is, that the system is set up today, has created this system of\nregulatory capture on steroids. So almost 50% of FDA's budget, comes from pharmaceutical companies. The people who work at FDA are, you know, their money is coming,\ntheir salaries are coming, from pharma, half their salaries. So they're, you know, they know who their bosses are, and that means getting those drugs done, getting them out the door and approved, as quickly as possible, it's\ncalled fast track approval. And they pay 50% of FDA's budget, goes about 45% actually\ngoes to fast track approval. - Do you think money can buy integrity? - Oh yeah, of course it can. In the reg, yeah, I mean, that's not something\nthat is controversial. Of course it will. So, and then- - Slightly controversial to me, I would like to think\nthat science that will- - Well it may not be able\nto buy your integrity. I'm talking about population wide, I'm not talking about the individual. - But I'd like to believe that scientists, I mean, in general, a\ncareer of a scientist, is not a very high paying job. I'd like to believe that\npeople that go into science, that work at FDA, that work at NIH, are doing it for a reason, that's not even correlated\nwith money, really. - Yeah, and I think probably\nthat's why they go in there. But scientists are\ncorruptible and, you know, and the way that I can tell you that, is that I've brought over 500 losses, and almost all of 'em involve\nscientific controversies. And there are scientists\non both sides, in everyone. When we sued Monsanto, there was, on the Monsanto side,\nthere was a Yale scientist, a Stanford scientist,\nand a Harvard scientist. And on our side there\nwas a Yale, Stanford, and Harvard scientists. And they were telling, saying\nexactly the opposite things. In fact, there's a word for\nthose kind of scientists, who take money, for their opinion, and the word is biostitutes. And they are very, very common. And, you know, and I've\nbeen dealing 'em with them, my whole career, you know, I think it was Upton Sinclair that said, \"that it's very difficult\nto persuade a man of a fact, if the existence of that fact\nwill diminish his salary.\" And I think that's true for all of us. If they, you know, we find a\nway of reconciling ourselves, the things that are, to truths, actually, and worldviews that actually\nbenefit our salaries. Now, NIH has probably the worst system, which is that scientists who work for NIH, NIH itself, which used to be the premier gold standard scientific\nagency in the world, everybody looked at NIH and that. Today it's just an incubator\nfor pharmaceutical drugs. And, you know, that is\nthat gravity of economic self-interest because if you're, if NIH itself collects royalties, they have margin rights for the patents, on all the drugs that they work on. So with the Moderna vaccine, which they promoted\nincessantly and aggressively, NIH own 50% of that vaccine, is making billions and\nbillions of dollars on it. And there are four, at\nleast four scientists, that we know of, and\nprobably at least six at NIH, who themselves have margining\nrights for those patents. So if you are a scientist who work at NIH, you work on a new drug,\nyou then get margin rights, and you're entitled to\nroyalties of $150,000 a year, forever from that, forever. Your children, your children's children, as long as that product's on the market, you can collect royalties. So you have, you know, the\nModerna vaccine is paying for the top people at NIH, you know, some of the top regulators,\nit's paying for their boats, it's paying for their mortgages, it's paying for their\nchildren's education. And you know, you have to expect that, that in those kind of situations, the regulatory function would be subsumed, beneath the mercantile\nambitions of the agency itself. And the individuals who\nstand to profit enormously, from getting a drug to market. Those guys are paid by us, the taxpayer, to find problems with those\ndrugs before they get to market. But if you know that drug is\ngonna pay for your mortgage, you may overlook a little\nproblem, or even a very big one. And that's the problem. - You've talked about\nthat the media slanders you by calling you an anti-vaxxer, and you've said that\nyou're not anti-vaccine, you're pro safe vaccine. Difficult question. Can you name any vaccines\nthat you think are good? - I think some of the live virus vaccines, are probably, averting more\nproblems than they're causing. There's no vaccine that is,\nyou know, safe and effective. In fact- - Those are big words,\nwhat about the polio? - [Robert] Those are big words. - Can we talk about the p- - [Robert] Well, here's the problem. - Yes. - Here's the problem. The polio vaccine contained a, a virus called Simian virus 40, SV40. It's one of the most\ncarcinogenic materials, that is known to man. In fact, it's used now by\nscientists around the world, to induce tumors and rats\nand Guinea pigs and labs. But it was in that vaccine, 98 million people who got that vaccine. And my generation got it. And now you've had this\nexplosion of soft tissue cancers, in our generation that\nkilled many, many, many, many, many more people\nthan polio ever did. So if you say to me, did the, you know, the polio vaccine was\neffective against polio? I'm gonna say yes. And if you say to me, did\nit kill more people than, did it cause more deaths than averted? I would say, I don't know, because we don't have\nthe data on that, so. - But let's talk, well, you know, we kinda have to narrow\nin on, is it effective, against the thing it's supposed to fight? - Oh, well, a lot of them are,\nlet me give you an example. The most popular vaccine in the world, is the DTP vaccine diphtheria,\npertussis, and tetanus. It was used in this, introduced\nin this country around 1980. That vaccine caused so many injuries, (indistinct) which was the manufacturer, said to the Reagan administration, \"we are now paying $20 in\ndownstream liabilities, for every dollar that\nwe're making in profits, and we are getting out of the business, unless you give us permanent\nimmunity from liability.\" So the vaccine companies then were given, and by the way, Reagan said at that time, \"why don't you just\nmake the vaccine safe?\" And why is that? Because vaccines are inherently unsafe. They said unavoidably unsafe,\nyou cannot make them safe. And so when Reagan wrote\nthe bill and passed it, the bill says in its preambles, \"because vaccines are unavoidably unsafe.\" And the Bruce Woods case, which\nwas the Supreme Court case, that upheld that bill\nuses that same language, vaccines cannot be made safe. They're unavoidably unsafe,\nso this is what the law says. Now, I just wanna finish this story, 'cause this illustrates\nvery well, your question. The DTP vaccine was\ndiscontinued in this country, and it was discontinued in Europe, 'cause the so many kids\nwere being injured by it. However, the WHO and Bill Gates gives it to 161 million African\nchildren every year. And Bill Gates went to\nthe Danish government, and asked them to support\nthis program saying, \"we've saved 30 million kids, from dying from diphtheria,\ntetanus, and pertussis.\" The Danish government said,\n\"can you show us the data?\" And he couldn't. So the Danish government\npaid for a big study, with Novo Nordisk, which is a Scandinavian vaccine company in West Africa. And they went to West Africa\nand they looked at the DTP vaccine for 30 years\nof data and they hire, they retained the best vaccine\nscientists in the world, these kind of deities of\nAfrican vaccine program, Peter Abbey, Sigrid Morganson\nand a bunch of others. And they looked at 30 years\nof data for the DTP vaccine. And they came back and they\nwere shocked by what they found. They found that the vaccine\nwas preventing kids, from getting diphtheria,\ntetanus, and pertussis. But the girls who got that vaccine, were 10 times more likely to\ndie over the next six months, than children who didn't. Why is that? And they weren't dying from anything, anybody ever associated with the vaccine. They were dying of anemia,\nbilharzia, malaria, sepsis, and mainly pulmonary and\nrespiratory disease, pneumonia. And it turns out this, this is what the researchers found, who were all pro-vaccine by the way. They said that this vaccine\nis killing more children, than diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, prior to the introduction of the vaccine. And for 30 years nobody ever noticed it. The vaccine was providing protection, against those target illnesses, but it had ruined the\nchildren's immune systems. And they could not defend\nthemselves against random infections that were\nharmless to most children. - But isn't it nearly impossible, to prove that link, isn't it? - You can't prove the link, all you can do is for\nany particular interest, you can't, illness or death,\nyou can't prove the link. But you can show statistically, that there is, that if\nyou get that vaccine, you're more likely to die, over the next six months\nthan if you don't. And those studies unfortunately, are not done for any other vaccines. So for every other medicine, in order to get approval from the FDA, you have to do a placebo\ncontrol trial prior to licenser, where you look at health outcomes, among an exposed group,\na group that gets it, and compare those to a similarly situated group that gets a placebo. The only medical intervention\nthat does not receive, that does not undergo\nplacebo controlled trials, prior to licenser, are vaccines. Not one of the 72 vaccines\nthat are now mandated, for our children have ever undergone, a placebo controlled\ntrial prior to licenser. - So I should say that there's\na bunch, on that point, I've heard from a bunch of\nfolks that disagree with you. - Okay.\n- [Lex] Including polio. I mean, and that test testing\nis a really important point. Before licensure, placebo\ncontrol randomized trials, polio, received just that, against the saline placebo control. So, it seems unclear to me. I'm confused why you say that, that they don't go through that process. It seems like a lot of them do. - Here's the thing is that, I was saying that for many years, 'cause we couldn't find any. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And then in 2016, in March, I met President Trump, ordered Dr. Fauci to meet with me, and Dr. Fauci and Francis Collins. And I said to them, during that meeting, \"you have been saying that\nI'm not telling the truth, when I said not one of these has undergone a prior pre-licensing placebo control.\" And the polio may have\nhad one, post licensing. Most of 'em haven't. The polio may have, I don't know. But I said, \"our question\nwas prior to licenser, do you ever test these?\" And for honor, for safety, and by the way, I think the polio vaccine did undergo, a saline placebo trial, prior licensure, but not for safety, only for efficacy. So I'm talking about safety trials, now. Fauci told me that, he said,\n\"I can't find one now,\" he had a whole tray of files there. He said, \"I can't find now one\nnow, but I'll send you one.\" I said, \"just for any vaccines, send me one, for any of the 72 vaccines.\" He never did. So we sued the HHS and after\na year of stonewalling us, HHS came back and they gave us a letter, saying we have no\npre-licensing safety trial, for any of the 72 vaccines. And that the letter from HHS, which settled our lawsuit\nagainst them 'cause we had a FOIA lawsuit against them, is\nposted on CHD's website. So anybody can go look at it. So if CHD had, if HHS had any study, I assume they would've given it to us, and they can't find one. - Well, let me zoom out because, a lot of the details matter here. Pre-licensure, what does\nplacebo controlled mean? So this is, this probably requires, a rigorous analysis. And actually at this point, it would be nice for me\njust to give the shout out, to other people much smarter than me, that people should follow along\nwith Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Use their mind, learn and think. So one really awesome creator,\nI really recommend him, is Dr. Dan Wilson. He hosts the \"Debunk the Funk\" podcast. Vincent Racaniello, who hosts\n\"This Week in Virology.\" Brilliant guy, I've\nhad him on the podcast. Somebody you've been\nbattling with, is Paul Offit. Interesting Twitter, interesting books. People should read, understand,\nand read your books as well. And Eric Topol has a good\nTwitter and good books. And even Peter Hotez,\nI'll ask you about him. - And people should, because Paul Offit, had published a Substack\nrecently debunking, I think, my discussion with Joe Rogan, and we have published a\ndebunk of his debunking, and you know, so if you read his stuff, you should read-\n- [Lex] Read both. - Yes, you should read... And I would love to\ndebate any of these guys."

      "text": "- So, Joe Rogan proposed\njust such a debate, which is quite fascinating to see how much attention and how much\nfunding it garnered, the debate between you and Peter Hotez. Why do you think Peter rejected the offer? - I think it's, you know, again, I'm not gonna look into his\nhead, but what I will say is, if you're a scientist\nand you're making public recommendations based upon what you say is evidence-based science. You ought to be able to defend that. You ought to be able to\ndefend it in a public forum, and you ought to be able to defend it. against all, you know, all comers. And, you know, so you know,\nif you're a scientist, science is based on, is\nrooted in logic and reason. And if you can't use\nlogic and reason to defend your position, and by the way, I know almost all of\nthe studies, you know, I've written books on them\nand we've made a big effort, to assemble all of the\nstudies on both sides. And so I'm prepared to\ntalk about those studies, and I'm prepared to\nsubmit them in advance. You know, and for each of\nthe points, and by the way, I've done that with Peter Hotez. You know, I've actually,\nbecause I had this, this kind of informal debate\nwith him several years ago, with him, with a referee at that time. And we were debating not only by phone, but by email and on those emails. Every point that he would\nmake, I would cite science, and he could never come back with science. He could never come\nback with publications. He would give publications\nthat had nothing to do with, for example, Thimerosal and vaccines, mercury based vaccines. He sent me one time, 16\nstudies to rebut something I'd said about Thimerosal. And not one of those studies, they were all about the MMR vaccine, which doesn't contain Thimerosal. So it wasn't like a real\ndebate where you're, you know, you're using\nreason and isolating points, and having a, you know,\na rational discourse. I don't think that he, I don't blame him for not debating me, because I don't think he has the science. - Are there aspects of all the\nwork you've done on vaccines, all the advocacy you've done, that you found out that\nyou were not correct on, that you were wrong on, that\nyou've changed your mind on? - Yeah, there are many times, over a time that I, you know, I found that I've made mistakes, and we correct those mistakes. You know, I run a big organization\nand I do a lot of tweets, you know, I'm very careful. For example, my Instagram, I was taken down from for misinformation, but there was no\nmisinformation on my Instagram. Everything that I cited on\nInstagram was cited or sourced, to a government database or\nto peer reviewed science. But for example, The Defender, which was our organization's newsletter, we summarized scientific\nreports all the time. That's one of the things,\nthe services that we provide. So we watch the, you know, PubMed, and we watch the peer\nreviewed publications, and we summarize them when they come out. We have made mistakes. When we make mistake, we are rigorous, about acknowledging it, apologizing\nfor it, and changing it. That's what we do. I think we have one of the most robust fact checking operations\nanywhere in journalism today. We actually do real science. And you know, there, listen, I've put up on my Twitter\naccount, there are numerous times that I've made mistakes on\nTwitter and I apologize for it. And people say to me, you\nknow, \"oh, that's weird. I've never seen anybody\napologize on Twitter.\" But I think it's really\nimportant at the only, of course, human beings make mistakes. My book is, you know,\n230 or 40, 50,000 words. There's gonna be a mistake in there. But you know what I say at\nthe beginning of the book, if you see a mistake in\nhere, please notify me. I give a way that people can notify me. And if somebody points out a\nmistake, I'm gonna change it. I'm not gonna dig my feet\nin and say, you know, I'm not gonna acknowledge this. - So some of the things\nwe've been talking about, you've been an outspoken contrarian, on some very controversial topics. This has garnered some\nfame and recognition, in part for being attacked\nand standing strong, against those attacks, if I\nmay say, for being a martyr. Do you worry about this drug of martyrdom, that might cloud your judgment? - First of all, yeah. I don't consider myself a martyr, and I have never\nconsidered myself a victim. I make choices about my life. And I'm content with those\nchoices and peaceful with them. I'm not trying to be a martyr\nor a hero or anything else. I'm doing what I think is right, 'cause I wanna be\npeaceful inside of myself. But, the only guard I have is just, you know, fact-based reality. If you show me a scientific\nstudy that shows that I'm wrong, for example, if you come back and say, \"look, Bobby, here's a polio, here's a safety study on polio\nthat was done pre-licensing, and use an a real saline solution,\" I'm gonna put that on my Twitter, and I'm gonna say I was wrong. There is one out there. So, you know, but that's all I can do."

I start at my first meal at around noon, and then I try to stop\neating at six or seven. And then I hike every day. - [Lex] Morning, evening? - In the morning. I go to a meeting, first\nthing in the morning, 12 seven meeting. And then I go hike for, and\nI hike uphill for a mile, and a half up and a mile\nhalf down with my dogs. And I do my meditations.

      "text": "- About God, you wrote, \"God talks to human beings\nthrough many vectors, wise people, organized religion, the great books of religions, through art, music, and poetry. But nowhere with such\ndetailing grace and joy, as through creation,\nwhen we destroy nature, we diminish our capacity\nto sense the divine.\" What is your relationship, and what is your understanding\nof God, who's God? - Well, I mean, God is\nincomprehensible, you know, I mean, I guess the most\nphilosophers would say we're, you know, we're inside the mind of God. And so it would be impossible\nfor us to understand, you know, what actually, you know, what God's form is. But I mean, for me, I\nhave a, let's say this. I was raised in a very, very\ndeeply religious setting. So we went to church in the\nsummer, oftentimes twice a day, morning mass, and we went to, we definitely went every Sunday. And I went, we prayed in the morning, we prayed before and after\nevery meal, we prayed at night, we said a rosary, sometimes\nthree rosaries a night. And my father read us the Bible. Whenever he was a home, he\nwould read us, you know, we'd all get in the bed and\nhe'd read us the Bible stories. And I went to Catholic schools,\nI went to Jesuit schools, I went to the nuns and I\nwent to a Quaker school, at one point. I became a drug addict when\nI was about 15 years old, about a year after my dad died. And I was addicted to drugs for 14 years. During that time, when you're an addict, you're living against conscience. And when you're living, and I never, you know, I was always\ntrying to get off of drugs, never able to, but I never felt\ngood about what I was doing. And when you're living against conscious, you kind of push God to the\nperipheries of your life. So I'll call him he,\nrecedes and gets smaller. And then when I, when I got sober, I knew that I had a couple of experiences. One is that I had a friend of my brothers, one of my brothers who died\nof this disease of addiction, had a good friend who had\nused to take drugs with us. And he became a moonie. So, he became a follower\nof Reverend Sun Myung Moon. And he's at that point, his compulsion. He had the same kind of\ncompulsion that I had, and yet it was completely\nremoved from him. And so, and he used to\ncome and hang out with us, but he would not wanna take drugs. Even if I was taken right in front of him, he was immune to it, he'd become\nimpervious to that impulse. And, when I first got sober, I knew that I did not wanna be the kind of person who was, you know, waking up every day in white\nknuckling sobriety and just, you know, trying to resist,\nresist through willpower. And by the way, I had\niron willpower as a kid. I gave up candy for Lent when I was 12. And I didn't eat it again\nuntil I was in college. I gave up desserts the next year for Lent. And I didn't ever ate another\ndessert till I was in college. And I was trying to bulk up\nfor rugby and for sports. So I felt like I could do\nanything with my willpower. But somehow this\nparticular thing, you know, the addiction, I was\ncompletely impervious to it. And it was cunning, baffling,\nbaffling, incomprehensible. I could not understand why\nI couldn't just say no, and then never do it again like\nI did with everything else. And so I was living against conscience, and I thought about this\nguy and I, you know, reflecting my own prejudices\nat that time in my life, I said to myself, I didn't wanna be, I didn't wanna be like a drug addict, who was wanting a drug all the time, and just not being able to do it. I wanted to completely realign myself, so that I was somebody\nwho got up every day, and just didn't wanna take\ndrugs, never thought of them, you know, kissed the wife and\nchildren, and went to work, and never thought about\ndrugs the whole day. And I knew that people\nthroughout history had done that. You know, I'd read the\nlives of the saints. I knew St. Augustine had had a very, very dissolute youth and, you know, had the spiritual\nrealignment transformation. I knew the same thing had happened, to the St. Paul, you know, at Damascus. The same thing had happened. St. Francis, St. Francis also had a\ndissolute and fun loving youth, and had this deep spiritual realignment. And I knew that that happened\nto people throughout history, and I thought that's what I needed. You know, something like that. I had the example of this friend of mine, and I used to think about him. And I would think this again reflects, the bias and the, you know, probably the meanness\nof myself at that time. But I said, I'd rather\nbe dead than be a moonie. But I wish I somehow\ncould distill that power, that he got without becoming\na religious nuisance. And at that time I picked\nup a book by Carl Jung, called \"Synchronicity.\" And Jung, he was a psychiatrist, he was contemporary of\nFreud's, Freud was his mentor. And, Freud wanted him\nto be his replacement. But Freud was atheist and Jung\nwas a deeply spiritual man. He had these very intense and genuine, spiritual experiences from\nwhen he was a little boy, from really was three years old, that he remembers biography is fascinating about him 'cause he remembers\nhim with such a detail. And he had written, he was always, he was in interesting to me, because he was very faithful scientist. And I considered myself\na science-based person, from when I was little. And yet he had this\nspiritual dimension to him, which infused all of\nhis thinking and really, I think made him, you know, branded his form of\nrecovery or of treatment. And he thought that he had\nthis experiment experience, that he describes in this book, where he's sitting up on the third, he ran one of the biggest\nsanitariums in Europe in Zurich. And he was sitting up on the\nthird floor of this building, and he's talking to a patient, who was talking describing\nher dream to him. And the fulcrum of that\ndream was a scarab beetle, which was an insect that is not, is very, very uncommon, if at\nall in northern Europe, but it's a common figure\nin the iconography, of Egypt and the hieroglyphics, on the walls of the pyramids, et cetera. And he, while he was talking to her, he heard this bing, bing,\nbing on the window behind him, and he didn't want to turn around, to take his attention off her. But finally he does it. He, in exasperation, he turns around, he throws up the window and\nhis scarab beetle flies in, lands in his head and he\nshows it to the woman. And he says, \"is this\nwhat you were thinking of? Is this what you were dreaming about?\" And he was struck by that experience, which was similar to other\nexperiences he's had like that. And that's what synchronicity means. It's an incident or coincidence, you know? And like if you're talking with somebody, about somebody that you haven't\nthought about in 20 years, and that person calls on the\nphone, that's synchronicity. Oh, and he believed it was a way that God intervened in our lives that broke all the rules of nature\nthat he had set up, the rules of physics,\nthe rules of mathematics, or, you know, to reach\nin and sort of tap us on the shoulder and say, I'm here. And, so he tried to reproduce\nthat in a clinical setting, and he would put one guy in one room, and another guy in another\nroom and have them flip cards. And guess what the other guy had flipped. And he believed that if he could beat the laws of chance, laws of mathematics, that he would approve the existence, of an unnatural law, a supernatural law. And that was the first step, to proving the existence of a God. He never succeeds in doing it. But he says in the book,\n\"even though I can't prove using empirical and scientific tools, the existence of a God, I can show through anecdotal evidence, having seen thousands of patients come through this institution, that people who believe\nin God get better faster, and that the recovery is more enduring, than people who don't.\" And for me, hearing\nthat was more impactful, than if he had claimed that he had proved the existence of a God. Because I wouldn't have believed that. But, I was already at a\nmindset where I would've done anything I could to improve my chances, of never having to take\ndrugs again by even 1%. And if believing in God was gonna help me, whether there's a god up there or not, believing in one's self\nhad the power to help me, I was gonna do that. So then the question is, how do you start believing in something, that you can't see or\nsmell or hear or touch. or taste or acquire with your senses? And Jung provides the formula for that. And he says, \"act as if, you\nfake it till you make it.\" And so that's, you know,\nwhat I started doing, I just started pretending there was a God, watching me all the time. And kind of, life was a series of tests, and each, there was a\nbunch of moral decisions, that I had to make every day. And each one, you know, these were all just\nlittle things that I did. But each one now for me\nhad a moral dimension. Like when I, you know,\nwhen the alarm goes off, do I lay in bed for an extra 10 minutes, with my indolent thoughts or\ndo I jump right outta bed? Do I make my bed, most\nimportant decision of the day? Do I hang up the towels? You know, do I, when I go into the closet, and pull out my blue\njeans, and a bunch of those wire hangers fall on the ground, do I shut the door and say, \"too much, I'm too important to do that. That's somebody else's job,\" or not. And so, do I put the\nwater in the ice tray, before I put in the freezer? Do I put the shopping cart\nback in the, you know, place that it's supposed to go, in the parking lot of the Safeway? And if I make a whole bunch\nof those choices right, that I maintain myself in\na posture of surrender, which keeps me open to the\npower, to my higher power, to my God, and when I, when\nI do those things right, when I, you know, so much about addiction, is about abuse of power, you know, abuse of, all of us have some power, whether it's our, you know, good looks, or whether it's, you know,\nconnections or education, or family or whatever. And there's always a\ntemptation to use those to fill, fulfill self will. And the challenge is how\ndo you use those always, to serve instead, God's will and the, you know, the good of our community. And that to me is kind of the struggle. And, when I do that, I feel, I feel God's power coming through me, and that I can do things. I'm much more effective as a human being. That that gnawing, you know,\nanxiety that I lived with, for so many years in my gut, it's gone. And that I can kind of\nlike put down the oars, and hoist the sail and you\nknow, and the wind takes me, and I can see the\nevidence of it in my life. And you know, the big thing, temptation for me is that, when all these good things\nstart happening in my life, and the cash and prizes\nstart flowing in, you know, how do I maintain that\nposture of surrender? How do I stay surrender\nthen when my inclination, is to say to God, \"thanks\nGod, I got it from here.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And drive the car off the cliff again. And so, you know, I had\na spiritual awakening, and my desire for drugs and\nalcohol was lifted miraculously. And it, to me, it was as\nmuch a miracle as if I had, if I'd been able to walk on water. 'Cause I had tried everything earnestly, sincerely and honestly for\na decade to try to stop it, and I could not do it\non under my own power. And then all of a sudden\nit was lifted effortlessly, and you know, so I saw that evidence, early evidence of God in my life, of the power and and I see it now, you know, every day in my life. - So adding that moral dimension, to all of your actions\nis how you were able to win that Camus battle\nagainst the absurd. - [Robert] Exactly. - Sisyphus with the boulder. - It's all the same thing. It's the battle to just\nto do the right thing. - Now Sisyphus was able\nto find somehow happiness. - [Robert] Yeah. (Lex laughs) - Well, Bobby, thank you for the stroll, through some of the\nmost important moments, in recent human history and\nfor running for president. And thank you for talking today. - Thank you Lex. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words, from John F. Kennedy. \"Let us not seek the Republican answer, or the Democratic answer,\nbut the right answer. Let us not seek to fix\nthe blame for the past. Instead, let us accept our own responsibility for the future.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."

  "full_text": "- It's not our business to\nchange the Russian government. And anybody who thinks it's a\ngood idea to do regime change, in Russia, which has more\nnuclear weapons than we do, is, I think, irresponsible. And, you know, Vladimir\nPutin himself has had, you know, we will not live\nin a world without Russia. And it was clear when he said that, that he was talking about himself, and he has his hand on a button\nthat could bring, you know, Armageddon to the entire planet. So why are we messing with this? It's not our job to change that regime. And, we should be making\nfriends with the Russians. We shouldn't be treating him as an enemy. Now, we've pushed him\ninto the camp with China. That's not a good thing for our country. And by the way, you know, what we're doing now does not appear to be weakening Putin at all. - The following is a conversation\nwith Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Candidate for the President\nof the United States, running as a Democrat. Robert is an activist, lawyer and author, who has challenged some of\nthe world's most powerful corporations seeking to\nhold them accountable, for the harm they may cause. I love science and engineering. These two pursuits are, to me, the most beautiful and powerful, in the history of human civilization. Science is our journey, our fight, for uncovering the laws of\nnature and leveraging them, to understand the universe and to lessen the amount of suffering in the world. Some of the greatest human\nbeings I've ever met, including most of my good friends, are scientists and engineers. Again, I love science, but science cannot\nflourish without epistemic, humility without debate,\nboth in the pages of academic journals and in the public square. In good faith, long form conversations. Agree or disagree, I\nbelieve Robert's voice should be part of the debate. To call him a conspiracy theorist, and arrogantly dismiss everything he says, without addressing it,\ndiminishes the public's trust, in the scientific process. At the same time, dogmatic skepticism of all scientific output\non controversial topics, like the pandemic is equally, if not more, dishonest and destructive. I recommend that people read and listen, to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. His arguments and his ideas. But I also recommend, as I\nsay in this conversation, that people read and listen\nto Vincent Racaniello, from \"This Week in Virology,\" Dan Wilson from \"Debunk The Funk,\" and the Twitter and books\nof Paul Offit, Eric Topol, and others who are outspoken, in their disagreement with Robert. It is disagreement, not conformity, that bends the long arc of\nhumanity toward truth and wisdom. In this process of disagreement, everybody has a lesson to teach you, but we must have the humility to hear it, and to learn from it. This is \"The Lex Fridman\nPodcast,\" to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It's the 4th of July Independence Day. So simple question, simple, big question. What do you love about this country, the United States of America? - I would say, well, there's so many things that\nI love about the country on, you know, the landscapes and\nthe waterways and the people, et cetera, but on the kind of a, you know, the higher level, people argue about whether\nwe're an exemplary nation. And, that term has been given a bad name, particularly by the neocons,\nthe actions, the neocons, in recent decades who have turned that, that phrase into kind of a justification, for forcing people to adopt\nAmerican systems or values, at the barrel of a gun. But my father and uncle used\nit in a very different way, and they were very proud of it. I grew up very proud of\nthis country because, we were the exemplary nation, in the sense that we were an example, of democracy all over the world. When we first launched\nour democracy in 1780, we were the only democracy on Earth. And by the Civil War, by 1865,\nthere were six democracies. Today there's probably\n190 and all of them, in one way or another, are modeled, on the American experience. And it's kind of\nextraordinary because sort of, our first contact with, our first serious and sustained contact, with the European culture and continent, was in 1608 when John Winthrop came over, with his puritans in the Arbella, and Winthrop gave this\nfamous speech where he said, \"this is a gonna be a city on a hill. This is gonna be an example for, you know, all the other nations in the world.\" And he warned that his fellow puritans, they were, you know, sitting at the, this great expanse of land. And he said, \"we can't be, we can't be seduced, by the lure of real estate, or by the carnal\nopportunities of this land. We have to take this\ncountry as a gift from God, and then turn it into an example, for the rest of the world of God's love, of God's will, and wisdom.\" And 200 years later, 250 years later, a different generation. They're mainly deists. They are people who had a belief in God, but not so much a love, of particularly religious cosmologies. You know, the framers, the Constitution, believe that we were creating something, that would be replicated around the world. And that it was an example. It would, in democracy,\nthere would be this kind of wisdom from the collective, you know, and the word wisdom means\na knowledge of God's will. And that somehow God would\nspeak through the collective, in a way that, that he or\nshe could not speak through, you know, through totalitarian regimes. And, you know, I think\nthat that's something, that even though Winthrop was\na white man and a Protestant, that every immigrant\ngroup who came after them, kind of adopted that belief. And I know my family when, you know, my family came over, all of\nmy grandparents came over, in 1848 during the potato famine. And, they saw this country\nis unique in history, is something that, you know, that was part of kind of a\nbroader spiritual mission. And so, I'd say that from\na 30,000 foot level that, I grew up so proud of this\ncountry and believing that it was the greatest country in the\nworld, and for those reasons. - Well, I immigrated to this country. And one of the things that really embodies America to me is the ideal of freedom. Hunter S. Thompson said, \"freedom is something that\ndies unless it's used.\" What does freedom mean to you? - To me, freedom does not\nmean, you know, chaos. And it does not mean anarchy. It means that, it has to be accompanied by restraint. If it's going to live up to its promise, in the self-restraint, what it means is the\ncapacity for human beings, to exercise and to fulfill their, their creative energies unrestrained, as much as possible by government. - So this point that Hunter\nS. Thompson has made, it \"dies unless it's used.\" Do you agree with that? - Yeah, I do agree with that. And you know, he was not\nunique in saying that, you know, Thomas Jefferson\nsaid that the Tree of Liberty had to be watered with the\nblood of each generation. And what he meant by that is that, you can't live off, we can't live off the laurels of the American Revolution. That, you know, we had a group, we had a generation where between 25,000, and 70,000 Americans died. They gave their lives, they\ngave their livelihoods, they gave their status,\nthey gave their property, and they put it all on the line, to give us our bill of rights and that. But those Bill of Rights, the moment that we signed them, there were forces within our society, that began trying to chip away at them. And that, you know, happens\nin every generation. And it is the obligation\nof every generation, to safeguard and protect those freedoms. - The blood of each generation. You mentioned your interest, your admiration of\nAlbert Camus of stoicism, perhaps your interest in existentialism. Camus said, I believe,\nin \"Myth of Sisyphus,\" \"the only way to deal\nwith an unfree world, is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is\nan act of rebellion.\" What do you think he means by that? - I suppose the way that\nCamus viewed the world, and the way that the stoics did, and a lot of the existentialists was, that it was so absurd and that, the problems and the\ntasks that were given, just to live a life are so insurmountable, that the only way that we can\nkind of get back at the gods for giving us this, you know, this impossible task of living life, was to embrace it and to enjoy it, and to do our best at it. I mean, to me, you know, I read Camus, and particularly in\nthe \"Myth of Sisyphus,\" kind of as a parable that, and it's the same lesson that I think, he writes about in \"The Plague,\" where we're all given\nthese insurmountable tasks, in our lives, but that by doing our duty, by being of service to others, we can bring meaning\nto a meaningless chaos, and we can bring order to the universe. And, you know, Sisyphus, was kind of the iconic hero of the stoics. And he was a man because he did, because he did something good. He delivered a gift to humanity. He angered the gods,\nand they condemned him, to push a rock up the hill every day. And then it would roll down. When he got to the top,\nit would roll down, and he'd spend the night\ngoing back down the hill, to collect it and then rolling it back, back up the hill again. And the task was absurd,\nit was insurmountable. He could never win. But the last line of that book\nis one of the great lines, which is something to the\nextent that, you know, \"I can picture Sisyphus smiling.\" Because Camus' belief\nwas that even though, his task was insurmountable,\nthat he was a happy man, and he was a happy man because he put his shoulder to the stone. He took his duty, he embraced the task, and the absurdity of life, and he pushed the stone up the hill. And that if we do that, and if, you know, we find ways of being\nof service to others, that is, you know, the ultimate,\nthat's the key to the lock. That's the solution to the puzzle. - Each individual person in\nthat way can rebel against absurdity by discovering meaning\nto this whole messy thing. - And we can bring meaning\nnot only to our own lives, but we can bring meaning\nto the universe as well. We can bring some kind of order to life. And, you know, the embrace of those tasks, and the commitment to service\nresonates out from us, to the rest of humanity in some way. - So you mentioned \"The Plague,\" by Camus. There's a lot of different\nways to read that book, but one of them, especially\ngiven how it was written, is that the plague\nsymbolizes Nazi Germany, and the Hitler regime. What do you learn about human nature, from a figure like Adolf Hitler? That he's able to captivate\nthe minds of millions, rise to power and take on, pull in the whole world into a global war? - I was born nine years after\nthe end of World War II, and I grew up in a generation\nthat was, you know, with my parents who were fixated on that, on what happened. And my father at that time, you know, the resolution in the\nminds of most Americans, and I think people around\nthe world is that there was, there had been something\nwrong with the German people, that, you know, the Germans had been particularly susceptible to\nthis kind of demagoguery, and to following a powerful leader, and just industrializing\ncruelty, and murder. And my father always differed with that. My father said, this is\nnot a German problem. This could happen to all of us, we're all just inches away from barbarity. And the thing that keeps\nus safe in this country, are the institutions of our\ndemocracy, our constitution. It's not our nature, you\nknow, our nature has to, has to be restrained and that\ncomes through self-restraint. But it also, you know,\nthe beauty of our country, is that we develop, we\ndevise these institutions, that are designed to allow us to flourish, but at the same time, not to give us enough freedom to flourish,\nbut also create enough order, to keep us from collapsing into barbarity. So, you know, one of the\nother things that my father talked about from when\nI was little, you know, he would ask us this question. If you were the family and\nAnne Frank came to your door, and asked you to hide her, would you be one of\nthe people who hid her? Like, risk your own life, or would you be one of the\npeople who turned her in? And of course we would all say, well, of course we would hide Anne\nFrank and take the risk. But, you know, that's been something, kind of a lesson, a\nchallenge that has been, that has always been near\nthe forefront of my mind, that if a totalitarian system ever occurs, in the United States, which my father thought\nwas quite possible. He was conscious about how\nfragile democracy actually is. That would I be one of\nthe ones who would resist, the totalitarianism or would\nI be one of the people, who went along with it? Would I be one of the people\nwho was at the train station, and, you know, in Kraków or, even Berlin and saw people\nbeing shipped off to camps, and just put my head down\nand pretend I didn't see it, because talking about\nit would be destructive to my career and maybe my\nfreedom and even my life. So, you know, that has been\na challenge that my father gave to me and all of\nmy brothers and sisters. And it's something that\nI've never forgotten. - A lot of us would like\nto believe we would resist, in that situation, but the\nreality is most of us wouldn't. And that's a good thing to think about, that human nature is\nsuch that we're selfish, even when there's an atrocity\ngoing on all around us. - And we also, you know, we have the capacity to deceive ourselves, and all of us tend to\nkind of judge ourselves, by our intentions and our actions. - What have you learned about life, from your father, Robert F. Kennedy? - First of all, I'll\nsay this about my uncle, 'cause you know, I'm\ngonna apply that question to my uncle and my father, my uncle was asked when he\nfirst met Jackie Bouvier, who later became Jackie Kennedy. She was a reporter for a\nnewspaper, and she was doing, she had a kind of column where she'd do, these kind of pithy interviews\nwith both famous people, and kind of man in the street interviews. And she was interviewing\nhim and she asked him, she thought what he believed\nhis best quality was, his strongest virtue. And she thought that he would say courage, because he had been a war hero. He was the only president who, and this when he was senator, by the way, who received the Purple Heart. And you know, he had a\nvery kind of famous story, of him as a hero in World War II. And then he had come home\nand he had written a book, on moral courage among\nAmerican politicians, and won the Pulitzer Prize, that book \"Profiles and Courage.\" And which was a series of incidents, where American political\nleaders made decisions, to embrace principle,\neven though their careers were at stake and in most cases, were destroyed by their choice. She thought he was gonna\nsay courage, but he didn't. He said curiosity. And I think, you know,\nlooking back at his life, that the best, that it was true, and that was the quality that allowed him, to put himself in the\nshoes of his adversaries. And he always said that if you, if the only way that\nwe're gonna have peace, is if we're able to put ourselves, in the shoes of our adversaries, understand their behavior\nand that context. And that's why he was able\nto, you know, during the, he was able to resist the\nintelligence apparatus, and the military during the\nBay of Pigs, when they said, you've gotta send in the\nEssex, the aircraft carrier. And he said, no, even though\nhe'd only been in month, two months in office, he was able to stand up to them, because he was able to\nput himself in the shoes, of both Castro and\nKhrushchev and understand, there's gotta be another solution to this. And then during the Cuban missile crisis, he was able to endure\none, the narrative was, okay, Khrushchev acted in a way, as an aggressor to put\nmissiles in our hemisphere. How dare he do that? And Jack and my father were able to say, well, wait a minute, he's doing that, because we put missiles\nin Turkey and Italy, that were right on, you know, and the Turkish ones, right\non the Russian border. And they then made a\nsecret deal with Dobrynin, with Ambassador Dobrynin, and, you know, with Khrushchev, to remove\nthe missiles, in Turkey, if he moved the Jupiter\nmissiles from Turkey, so long as Khrushchev\nremoved them, from Cuba, there were 13 men on the end, what they call the End CON Committee, which was the group of\npeople who were deciding, you know, what the action was, what they were gonna do to\nend the Cuban missile crisis. And virtually I, and of those men, 11 of them wanted to invade\nand wanted to bomb and invade. And it was Jack, and\nthen later on, my father, and Bob McNamara, who\nwere the only people, who were with him. Because he was able to see the world, from Khrushchev's point of view, he believed that there\nwas another solution. And then he also had the moral courage. So my father, you know, to\nget back to your question, famously said that moral courage, is the most important\nquality, and it's more rare, than courage on the football field, or courage in battle\nthan physical courage. It's much more difficult to come by, but it's the most important\nquality in a human being. - And you think that kind of empathy, that you referred to, that\nrequires moral courage. - It certainly requires\nmoral courage, to act on it, you know, and particularly, any time that a nation is at war, there's kind of a momentum\nor an inertia that says, okay, let's not look at this, from the other person's point of view. And that's the time we\nreally need to do that. - Well, if we can apply\nthat style of empathy, style of curiosity to the\ncurrent war in Ukraine, what is your understanding of why Russia, invaded Ukraine in February, 2022? - Vladimir Putin could have\navoided the war in the Ukraine. His invasion was illegal,\nit was unnecessary, and it was brutal. But I think it's important for us, to move beyond these kind\nof comic book depictions. Of this insane,\navaricious, Russian leader, who wants to, you know,\nrestore the Soviet Empire. And that, that's why, and\nwho made a unprovoked, unprovoked invasion of the Ukraine. He was provoked and we were provoking him, and we were provoking him, since 1997. And it's not just me\nthat's saying that, I mean, before Russia, before Putin never came in, we were provoking Russia, Russians, in this way unnecessarily. And to go back that time in 1992, when the Russians moved out of, when the Soviet Union was collapsing, the Russians moved out of East Germany, and they did that, which was\na huge concession to them. They had 400,000 troops in\nEast Germany at that time, and they were facing NATO troops, on the other side of the wall. So Gorbachev made this huge concession, where he said to George Bush, \"I'm gonna move all of our troops out, and you can then reunify\nGermany under NATO,\" which was a hostile army to the Soviet. It was created to, you know, with hostile intent\ntoward the Soviet Union. And he said, \"you can take\nGermany, but I want your promise that you will not move NATO, to the east.\" And James Baker, who was\nhis secretary of State, famously said, \"I will not move NATO. We will not move NATO\none inch to the East.\" So then five years later in\n1997, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was kind of the father of the neocons, who was a Democrat at that time, served in the Carter administration. He said, he published\na paper, a blueprint, for moving NATO right up\nto the Russian border, a thousand miles to the East, and taking over 14 nations. And at that time, George Kennon, who was the kind of the\ndeity of American diplomats, he was probably, arguably\nthe most important diplomat in American history. He was the architect of the containment policy during World War II. And he said, \"this is\ninsane and it's unnecessary. And if you do this, it's\ngonna provoke the Soviet, I mean, the Russians\nto a violent response. And we should be making\nfriends with the Russians. They lost the Cold War. We should be treating 'em\nthe way that we treated our adversaries after World War II, like with a Marshall Plan to\ntry to help them incorporate, into Europe and to be part\nof the brotherhood of, you know, of man and of western nations. We shouldn't continue to be\ntreating him as an enemy, and particularly surrounding\nthem at their borders.\" William Perry, who was then, the Secretary of defense\nunder Bill Clinton, threatened to resign. He was so upset by this plan\nto move NATO to the east. And William Burns, who was\nthen the US Ambassador, of the Soviet Union, who\nis now at this moment, the head of the CIA, said\nat the time, the same thing. \"If you do this, it is going to provoke the Russians toward a military response.\" And we moved it, we\nmoved all around Russia, we moved to 14 nations a\nthousand miles to the East, and we put Asia's missile\nsystems in two nations, in Romania and Poland,\nso we did what, you know, what the Russians had done to\nus in 1962 that had provoked, would've provoked an invasion of Cuba. We put those missile systems back there, and then we'd walk away,\nunilaterally walk away, from the two nuclear missile treaties, the intermediate nuclear missile treaties, that we had with this Soviet, with Russia. And, neither of us would put on those missile systems on the borders. We walk away from that and we\nput Asia's missile systems, which are nuclear capable. They can carry the tomahawk missiles, which have nuclear warheads. So the last country that they\ndidn't take was the Ukraine. And the Russians said, and\nin fact Bill Perry said this, or William Burns said, it is now the head of the CIA. It is a red line, if we go, if we bring NATO into Ukraine, that is a red line for the Russians. They cannot live with it,\nthey cannot live with it. Russia has been invaded three\ntimes through the Ukraine. The last time it was invaded, we killed, or the Germans killed one\nout of every seven Russians. They destroyed, my uncle\ndescribed what happened to Russia, in his famous American\nuniversity speech, in 1963, 60 years ago this month, or last month, 60 years ago, in June, June 10th, 1963. He told, that speech was\ntelling American people, put yourself in the shoes of the Russians. We need to do that if we're gonna, if we're gonna make peace. And he said, \"all of us\nhave been taught, you know, that we won the war, but\nwe didn't win the war. The Russians, if anybody\nwon the war against Hitler, it was the Russians, their\ncountry was destroyed. All of their cities.\" And he said, \"imagine if all of the cities\nfrom the east coast of Chicago were reduced to rubble and\nall of the fields, burned, all of the forests, burned. That's what happened to\nRussia, that's what they gave. So that we could get rid of Adolf Hitler.\" And he had them put\nthemselves in their position. And you know, today, there's\nnone of that happening. We have refused repeatedly,\nto talk to the Russians. We've broken up, there's two treaties, the Minsk agreements, which the Russians were willing to sign, and\nthey said, \"we will stay out.\" The Russians didn't want the Ukraine. They showed that, when the Donbas, when they voted 90 to 10\nto leave and go to Russia, Putin said, \"no, we want\nUkraine to stay intact, but we want you to sign a Minsk accords,\" to, you know, the Russians\nwere very worried, because of the US involvement in the coup, in Ukraine in 2014. And then the oppression, you know, and the killing of 14,000 ethnic Russians. And Russia hasn't had, the same way, that if Mexico, with\nAsia's missile systems, from China or Russia on our border, and then killed 14,000 expats American, we would go in there. Oh, he does have a national security interest in the Ukraine. He has an interest in protecting the Russian speaking\npeople of the Ukraine, the ethnic Russians. And the Minsk accords did that. It left Ukraine as part of Russia. It left them as a semi-autonomous region, that could continued to\nuse their own language, which is essentially banned by the coup, by the government we put in, in 2014. And, we wouldn't, we\nsabotaged that agreement. And, we now know in April of 2022, Zelensky and Putin had\ninked a deal already, to another peace agreement. And that the United\nStates and Boris Johnson, the neocons in the White\nHouse and Boris Johnson, over to the Ukraine to\nsabotage that agreement. So what do I think? I think this is a proxy war. I think this is a, you know, this is a war that the neocons\nin the White House wanted. They've said for two decades\nthey wanted this war, and that they wanted to\nuse Ukraine as a pawn, in a proxy war between\nUnited States and Russia, the same as we used Afghanistan. And in fact, they say\nit, this is the model, let's use the Afghanistan model, that was said again and again, and to get the Russians to\noverextend their troops, and then fight them using\nlocal fighters and US weapons. And when President Biden was asked, \"why are we in the Ukraine?\" He was honest, he says,\n\"to depose Vladimir Putin, regime change for Vladimir Putin.\" And when his defense\nsecretary Lloyd Austin, in April, 2022 was asked,\nyou know, \"why are we there?\" He said, \"to degrade the Russians capacity to fight anywhere, to\nexhaust the Russian army, and degrade its capacity to\nfight elsewhere in the world.\" That's not a humanitarian mission. That's not what we were told. We were told this was\nan unprovoked invasion, and that we're there to\nbring a humanitarian relief to the Ukrainians, but\nthat is the opposite. That is a war of attrition\nthat is designed to chew up, to turn this little nation\ninto an abattoir of death, for the flower of Ukrainian youth, in order to advance a\ngeopolitical ambition, of certain people within the White House. And I, you know, I think that's wrong. We should be talking to the\nRussians the way that, you know, Nixon talked to Brezhnev, the way that Bush talked to Gorbachev, the way that my uncle\ntalked to Khrushchev. We need to be talked with the Russians, we should, and negotiating. And we need to be looking about, how do we end this and\npreserve peace in Europe. - Would you as president sit down, and have a conversation\nwith Vladimir Putin, and Vladimir Zelensky separately, and together, to negotiate peace? - Absolutely, absolutely. - What about Vladimir Putin? He's been in power since 2000. So as the old adage goes, \"power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts, absolutely.\" Do you think he has been corrupted, by being in power for so long? If you think of the man,\nif you look at his mind. - Listen, I don't know exactly. I can't say because I just, I don't know enough about\nhim or about, you know, the evidence that I've seen\nis that he is homicidal, he kills his enemies, or poisons them. And you know, the reaction\nI've seen to that, to those accusations from him\nhave not been to deny that. But to kind of laugh it off, I think he's a dangerous man. And that of course, you know, there's probably corruption in his regime. But having said that, it's not our business, to\nchange the Russian government. And anybody who thinks it's a good idea, to do regime change in Russia, which has more nuclear weapons than we do, is, I think, irresponsible. And you know, Vladimir Putin\nhimself has said, you know, \"we will not live in a\nworld without Russia.\" And it was clear when he said that, that he was talking about himself, and he has his hand on a\nbutton that could bring, you know, Armageddon to the entire planet. So why are we messing with this? It's not our job to change that regime. And, we should be making\nfriends with the Russians. We shouldn't be treating him as an enemy. Now we've pushed him\ninto the camp with China. That's not a good thing for our country. And by the way, you know,\nwhat we're doing now, does not appear to be\nweakening Putin at all. Putin now, you know, if\nyou believe the polls, that are coming out of Russia,\nthey show him, you know, the most recent polls\nthat I've seen show him, with an 89% popularity\nthat people in Russia, support the war in Ukraine and that, and they support him as an individual. So, and I understand there's\nproblems with polling, you know, you don't know what to believe, but the polls consistently show that. And, you know, it's\nnot America's business, to be the policeman of the world, and to be changing regimes\nin the world, that's illegal. We shouldn't be breaking\ninternational laws. You know, we should actually be looking for ways to improve\nrelationships with Russia. Not to, you know, not to destroy Russia, not to destroy and not to\nchoose its leadership for them. That's up to the Russian people, not us. - So step one is to\nsit down and empathize, with the leaders of both\nnations to understand their history, their\nconcerns, their hopes. Just to open the door for conversation, so they're not backed into the corner. - Yeah, and I think the US can\nplay a really important role, and a US president can play\na really important role, by reassuring the Russians, that we're not gonna consider\nthem an enemy anymore, that we wanna be friends. And it doesn't mean that you\nhave to let down your guard, completely, the way that you do it, which was the way\nPresident Kennedy did it, is you do it one step at a time. You take baby steps, we\ndo a unilateral move, reduce our, you know, our\nhostility and aggression, and see if the Russians reciprocate. And, that's the way that\nwe should be doing it. And you know, we should be easing our way, into a positive relationship with Russia. We have a lot in common with Russia, and we should be friends with Russia, and with the Russian people. And you know, apparently\nthere's been 350,000 Ukrainians, who have died, at least in this war. And there's probably been\n60 or 80,000 Russians. And that should not give us any joy. It should not give us any, you know, I saw Lindsey Graham\non TV saying, you know, something to the extent that,\n\"anything we can do to kill Russians is a good use of our money.\" It is not, you know, those\nare somebody's children. They're, you know, we should\nhave compassion for them. This war is an unnecessary war. We should settle it through\nnegotiation, through diplomacy, through state graft,\nand not through weapons. - Do you think this\nwar can come to an end, purely through military operations? - No, I mean, no, I don't think\nthere's any way in the world that the Ukrainians can beat the Russians. I don't think there's\nany appetite in Europe. I think Europe is now, you know, in having severe problems\nin Germany, Italy, France, you're seeing these riots, there's internal problems\nin those countries. There is no appetite in Europe, for sending men to die in Ukraine. And the Ukrainians do\nnot have anybody left. The Ukrainians are using\npress gangs, you know, to fill the ranks, their armies, men, military aged men are\ntrying as hard as they can, to get outta the Ukraine right now, to avoid going to the front, the Russians apparently have\nbeen killing Ukrainians, at a seven to one ratio. My son fought over there\nand he told me it's, he had firefights with the\nRussians, mainly at night. But he said most of the battles, were artillery wars during the day. And the Russians now\noutgun the NATO forces, 10 to one in artillery. Oh, they're killing at a horrendous rate. Now, you know, my interpretation\nof what's happened so far, is that, Putin actually went in early on, with a small force because he expected to meet somebody on the other end of a negotiating table\nthat once he went in, and when that didn't happen, they did not have a large enough force, to be able to mount an offensive. And so they've been building\nup that force up till now, and they now have that force. And even against this\nsmall original force, the Ukrainians have been helpless. All of their offenses have died. They've now killed, you know, the head of the Ukrainian special forces, which was the, probably,\narguably, by many accounts, the best elite military\nunit in all of Europe, the commander of that\nSpecial Forces group, had gave a speech about four months ago, saying that 86% of his\nmen are dead or wounded, and cannot return to the front. He cannot rebuild that force. And the troops that are now headed, that are now filling the gaps\nof all those 350,000 men, who have been lost are scantily trained, and they're arriving green at the front. Many of them do not wanna be there. Many of them are giving up and\ngoing over the Russian side. We've seen this again and again and again, including platoon size groups, that are defecting to the Russians. And I don't think it's possible to win. And anybody, (laughs) you know, I saw, of course I've studied World\nWar II history exhaustively, but I saw a, there's a new, I\nthink it's a Netflix series, of documentaries that I highly\nrecommend to people there. They're colorized versions\nof the black and white, films from the battles of World War II but it's all the battles of World War II. So I watched all of that the\nother night, and you know, the willingness of the\nRussians to fight on, against any kind of, and\nto make huge sacrifices, of Russians, the Russians themselves, who were making the\nsacrifice with their lives, the willingness of them to do that, for their motherland is\nalmost inexhaustible. It is incomprehensible\nto think that Ukraine, can beat Russia in a war. It would be like Mexico\nbeating the United States. It's just impossible to\nthink that it can happen. And, you know, Russia has deployed a tiny, tiny fraction of its military so far. And you know, now it has China, with its mass production capacity, supporting its war effort. It's a hopeless situation,\nand we've been lied to, you know, the press in our\ncountry and our government, are just, you know, promoting this lie, that the Ukrainians are about to win, and that everything's going great. And that Putin's on the\nrun, and there's all this wishful thinking because of\nthe Wagner Group, you know- - [Lex] Prigozhin.\n- Prigozhin, and the Wagner Group, that\nthis was an internal coup, and it showed dissent\nand weakness of Putin. And none of that is true. That insurgency, which\nwasn't even an insurgency. He only got 4,000 of his men\nto follow him out of 20,000. And they were quickly stopped. And nobody in the Russian\nmilitary, the oligarchy, the political system, nobody\nsupported it, you know, and but we're being told, \"oh yeah, it's the beginning at the end for Putin. He's weakened, he's wounded,\nhe's on his way out,\" and all of these things are\njust lies that we are being fed. - So to pushback on a\nsmall aspect of this, that you kind of implied. So I've traveled to Ukraine and\none thing that I should say, similar to the Battle of\nStalingrad, it is just not, it is not only the Russians\nthat fight to the end. I think Ukrainian is a very,\nlike to fight to the end. And the morale there is quite high. I've talked to nobody,\nthis was a year ago, in August, in Kherson,\neverybody was proud, to fight and die for their country. And there's some aspect where this war unified the people, gave them a reason, and an understanding that\nthis is what it means, to be Ukrainian and I\nwill fight to the death, to defend this land. - Yeah, you know, I would agree with that, and I should have said that\nmyself at the beginning, that's one of the reasons\nmy son went over there, to fight because, you know,\nhe was inspired by the valor, of the Ukrainian people and, you know, this extraordinary willingness of them. And I think Putin thought\nit would be much easier, to sweep into Ukraine,\nand he found, you know, a stone wall of Ukrainians, ready to put their lives and their bodies on the line. But that to me makes the whole\nepisode even more tragic, is that, you know, I don't believe, I think that the US role in this has been, you know, that there\nwere many opportunities, to settle this war. And the Ukrainians wanted to settle it. Vladimir Zelensky when he ran in 2019. Here's a guy who's a\ncomedian, he's an actor. He had no political experience, and yet he won this election\nwith 70% of the vote, why? He won on a peace platform, and he won promising to\nsign the Minsk accords. And yet something happened\nwhen he got in there, that made him suddenly\npivot, and, you know, I think it's a good guess what happened. I think he was, you know,\nhe came under threat, by ultra nationalists within\nhis own administration, and the insistence of neocons\nlike Victoria Newland, in the White House, that, you know, we don't want peace with\nPutin, we want a war. - Do you worry about nuclear war? - [Robert] Yeah, I worry about it. - [Lex] It seems like a\nsilly question, but it's not, it's a serious question. - Well, the reason it's not, you know, the reason it's not, is because people seem to be in this kind of dream state about\nthat it'll never happen. And yet, you know, it can happen very easily and\nit can happen at any time. And, you know, if we push\nthe Russians too far, you know, I don't doubt that Putin, if he felt like his regime was in, or his nation was in danger, that the United States was\ngonna be able to place, you know, a Quisling on, you know, into the Kremlin that\nhe would use nuclear, you know, torpedoes. And these strategic\nweapons that they have. And that could be it, once you do that, nobody controls the trajectory. By the way, you know, I\nhave very strong memories, of the Cuban Missile\nCrisis and those 13 days, when we came closer to\nnuclear war, you know, and particularly I think it\nwas when the U2 got shot down, over Cuba, you know, and\nnobody in this country, there's a lot of people in\nWashington DC who at that point, thought that they very\nmay well may wake up dead, that the world may end at night. 30 million Americans killed\n130 million Russians. This is what our military brass wanted. They saw a war with Russia. Nuclear exchange with Russia\nis not only inevitable, but also desirable because\nthey wanted to do it now, while we still had a superiority. - Can you actually go\nthrough the feelings, you've had about the Cuban Missile Crisis? Like what are your memories of it? What are some interesting kind of- - Well, you know, in the middle, I was going to school in Washington, DC, to sit, to our Lady of Victory, which is in Washington DC. So we were, I lived in\nVirginia across Potomac, and we would cross the\nbridge every day into DC, and during the crisis, US\nMarshals came to my house, to take us, I think around day eight. My father was spending the\nnight at the White House. He wasn't coming home, he was staying with the EXCOM\ncommittee and sleeping there. And they were up, you\nknow, 24 hours a day. They were debating and\ntrying to figure out, what was happening. But we had US marshals come\nto our house to take us down. They were gonna take us down\nto White Sulfur Springs, in Southern Virginia, in\nthe Blue Ridge Mountains, where there was an underground city, essentially a bunker that was like a city. And apparently it had McDonald's in it, and a lot of other, you know, it was a full city for the US\ngovernment and their families. US Marshals came to our\nhouse to take us down there. And I was very excited about doing that. And this was at a time, you know, when we were doing the drills, we were doing the duck and\ncover drills once a week, at our school where they would tell you, when the alarms go off, then you put your head onto the table, you take, remove the\nsharps from your desk, put them inside your desk, you put your head onto\nthe table and you wait. And the initial blast,\nwill take the windows, out of the school and\nthen we all stand up, and file in an orderly\nfashion into the basement, where we're gonna be for the next six or eight months or whatever. But in the basement where, you know, we went occasionally in those corridors. were lined with freeze\ndried food canisters up to, from floor to ceiling,\nso people were, you know, we were all preparing for this. And it was, you know, Bob McNamara, who was a friend of mine\nand you know, was my father, one of my father's close\nfriends as Secretary of Defense. He later called it mass psychosis. And my father deeply\nregretted participating in the bomb shelter\nprogram because he said, \"it was part of a\npsychological psyop trick, to teach Americans, that nuclear war was acceptable,\nthat it was survivable.\" And my father, anyway, when\nthe marshals came to our house, take me and my brother Joe away, and we were the ones who\nwere home at that time, my father called and he\ntalked to us on the phone, and he said, \"I don't\nwant you going down there, because if you disappear from school, people are gonna panic. And I need you to be a good\nsoldier and go to school.\" And he said something to\nme during that period, which was that, \"if a nuclear were happen, it would be better to be among the dead, than the living,\" which\nI did not believe, okay. I mean, I had already prepared myself, for the dystopian future. And I knew I could, I spent\nevery day in the woods. I knew that I could survive\nby catching crawfish, and, you know, cooking mud puppies, and do whatever I had to do. But I felt like, okay,\nI could handle this. And I really wanted to see this set up, down in, you know, this underground city. But anyway, that was, you\nknow, part of it for me. My father was away, and you\nknow, the last days of it, my father got this idea, because Khrushchev had sent two letters. He sent one letter that was conciliatory, and then he sent a letter\nthat after his joint chiefs, and the war mongers around him, saw that letter and\nthey disapproved of it. They sent another letter that\nwas extremely belligerent. And my father had the\nidea, let's just pretend, we didn't get the second letter\nand reply to the first one. And then he went down\nto Dobrynin and who was, he met Dobrynin in the Justice Department, and Dobrynin was the Soviet ambassador. And they, you know, they\nproposed this settlement, which was a secret settlement. Eric Khrushchev would withdraw\nthe missiles from Cuba. Khrushchev had put the missiles in Cuba, 'cause we had put missiles,\nyou know, nuclear missiles in Turkey and Italy. And my uncle's secret deal was that if he, if Khrushchev removed\nthe missiles from Cuba, within six months, he would get rid of the\nJupiter missiles in Turkey. But if Khrushchev told anybody\nabout the deal, it was off. So, if news got out about\nthat secret deal, it was off, that was the actual deal and\nKhrushchev complied with it, and then my uncle complied with it. - How much of that part of human history, turned on the decisions of one person? - I think that's one of the, you know, 'cause that of course is the\nperennial question, right? Is history kind of, an automatic pilot and,\nyou know, human decisions, the decisions of leaders\nreally only have, you know, a marginal or incremental bearing, on what is gonna happen, anyway. But I think that is, and historians argue\nabout that all the time. I think that that is\na really good example, of a place in human history that, literally the world could have ended, if we had a different\nleader in the White House. And the reason for that is\nthat there were, as I recall, 64 gun emplacements, you\nknow, missile emplacements. Each one of those missile\nemplacements had a crew, of about a hundred men\nand they were Soviets. So they were, we didn't know whether, we had a couple of questions\nthat my uncle asked, Alan, or asked the CIA. And he asked, Dulles was already gone. But he asked the CIA and he\nasked his military brass, 'cause they all wanted to go\nin, everybody wanted to go in. And my uncle said, my uncle\nasked to see the aerial photos. And he examined those personally, and that's why it's\nimportant to have a leader, in the White House who can push\nback on their bureaucracies. And then he asked them, you know, \"who's manning those missile sites? And are they Russians? And if they're Russians and we bomb them, isn't it gonna force Khrushchev\nto then go into Berlin?\" And that would be the\nbeginning of a cascade effect, that would, you know, highly likely, to have a nuclear confrontation. And the military brass said to my uncle, \"oh, we don't think he'll\nhave the guts to do that.\" So he was, my uncle was like, \"that's what you're betting on?\" And you know, they all\nwanted him to go in, they wanted him to bomb the\nsites and then invade Cuba. And he said, \"if we bomb those sites, we're gonna be killing\nRussians and it's gonna force, it's gonna provoke Russia\ninto some response. And the obvious response is\nfor them to go into Berlin.\" Oh, but the thing that\nwe didn't know then, that we didn't find out\nuntil, I think, you know, it was like a 30 year anniversary, of the Cuban Missile Crisis in Havana. And what we learned then was that, from the Russians, who came to that event, it was like a symposium where everybody on both sides talked about it. And we learned a lot of stuff that never, nobody knew before. One of the insane things,\nthe most insane thing, that we learned was that\nthe weapons were already, the nuclear warheads\nwere already in place. They were ready to fire. And that the authorization to fire, was made, was delegated, to\neach of the gun crew commanders. So there were 60 people who\nhad all had authorization, to fire if they felt\nthemselves under attack. So you have to believe, that at least one of\nthem, would've launched, and that would've been\nthe beginning of the end. And, you know, if anybody had launched, you know, we knew what would happen. My uncle knew what would happen, 'cause he asked again and\nagain, \"what's gonna happen?\" And they said, \"30 million\nAmericans will be killed, but we will kill 130 million\nRussians, so we will win.\" And that was a victory for them. And my uncle said later said, he told Arthur Schlesinger\nand Kenny O'Donnell, he said, those guys, he called 'em the salad brass, the guys with all of this\nstuff on their chest. And he said, \"those guys, they don't care, 'cause they\nknow that if it happens, that they're gonna be in\nthe charge of everything, they're the ones who are gonna be running the world after that.\" So for them, you know, it\nwas, there was an incentive, to kill 130 million Russians,\nand 30 million Americans. But my uncle, he had this correspondence, with the Khrushchev. They were secretly\ncorresponding with each other. And that is what saved the world, is that they had, that both\nof them had been men of war. You know, Eisenhower famously said, \"it will not be a man of war. It will not be a soldier,\nwho starts World War III,\" 'cause a guy who's actually\nseen it, knows how bad it is. And my uncle, you know, had been in the heat of the South Pacific, his boat would've been cut\ninto by a Japanese destroyer. Many of three of his\ncrewmen have been killed. One of 'em badly burned. He pulled that guy with\na lanyard in his teeth, six miles to an island in\nthe middle of the night. And then they hid out there for 10 days. You know, and he came back, like I said, he was the only president\nof the United States, that earned in the Purple Heart. Meanwhile, Khrushchev\nhad been at Stalingrad, which was the worst place to\nbe on the planet, you know, probably in the 20th century,\nother than, you know, in Auschwitz or one of the death camps. It was, you know, it\nwas the most ferocious, horrific war with people starving people, committed cannibalism,\nyou know, eating the dogs, the cats, eating their shoe leather, or easing to death by\nthe thousands, et cetera. Khrushchev did not want, the\nlast thing he wanted was a war. And the last thing my\nuncle wanted was war. But the CIA did not know\nanything about Khrushchev. And the reason for that, is there was a mole at Langley, so that every time the CIA\ngot a spy in the Kremlin, he would immediately be killed. So they had no eyes in the Kremlin. You know, there were literally hundreds, of Russians spies who had, who had defected the United\nStates and were in the Kremlin, who were killed during that period. They had no idea anything\nabout Khrushchev, about how he saw the world. And they saw the Kremlin\nitself as a monolith. You know, that this kind of, you know, the same way that we look at Putin today, they have this ambition of world conquest, and it's driving them, and there's nothing else they think about. They're absolutely single-minded about it. But actually there was a big\ndivision between Khrushchev, and his joint chiefs and\nhis intelligence apparatus. And they both at one point discovered, they were both in the same situation. They were surrounded by\nspies and military personnel, who were intent on going to war. And they were the two guys resisting it. So when my uncle had\nthis idea of, you know, being the peace president\nfrom the beginning, he told Ben Bradley, one\nof his best friends who, you know, was the publisher\nof the Washington Post, the editor-in-chief at that time. He said, Ben Bradley asked him, \"what do you want on your gravestone?\" And my uncle said, \"he kept the peace.\" He said, \"the principle\njob of the president of the United States is to keep\nthe country out of war.\" And, so when he first became president, he actually agreed to\nmeet Khrushchev in Geneva, to do his summit, and by the way, Eisenhower wanted to do the same thing. Eisenhower wanted peace, and he was gonna meet in Vienna. But that peace summit was blown up. He was gonna try to do, you know, he was gonna try to end the Cold War. Eisenhower was in the last\nyear of his, in May of 1968. But that was torpedoed by\nthe CIA, during the U2 crash. You know, they sent a U2\nover the Soviet Union. It got shot down, and then they told, and then Alan Dulles, told Eisenhower, to deny that we had a program. They didn't know that the Russians had captured Gary Francis Powers. And that blew up the peace talks, between Eisenhower and Khrushchev. And so, you know, there\nwas a lot of tension. My uncle wanted to break that tension. He agreed to meet, with\nKhrushchev in Vienna, early on in his term. He went over there and\nKhrushchev snubbed him. Khrushchev lectured him, imperiously, about the terror of American imperialism, and rebuffed any, you know, they did agree not to go into Laos. They made an agreement that\nkept the United States, kept my uncle from sending troops to Laos, but it had been a disaster, Vienna. So then we had a spy that\nused to come to our house, all the time, a guy\ncalled Georgi Bolshakov, and he was this Russian spy. My parents had met at the embassy. They had gone to a party or a reception, at the Russian Embassy. And he had approached them, and they knew he was GRU agent and KGB. He was both, oh, he used\nto come to our house. They really liked him,\nhe was very attractive. He was always laughing and joking. He would do rope climbing\ncontests with my father. He would do pushup\ncontests with my father. He could do the Russian\ndancing, the Cossacks dancing. And he would do that for\nus and teach us that. And we knew he was a spy too. And this was at the time of, you know, the James Bond films\nwere first coming out. So it was really exciting for us, to have a actual Russian spy in our house. (Lex laughs) The State Department was horrified by it. - [Lex] Yeah. - But anyway, when\nKhrushchev, after Vienna, and after, you know, the Bay of Pigs, Khrushchev had second thoughts\nand he sent this long letter, to my uncle, and he\ndidn't wanna go through his state department or his embassy. He wanted to Enron them, and\nhe was friends with Bolshakov, so he gave Georgi the letter,\nand Georgi brought it, and handed it to Pierre Salinger, folded in the New York Times. And he gave it to my uncle. And it was this beautiful\nletter, which he said, you know, my uncle had talked to\nhim about the children, who were played, you know, how we played, 29 grandchildren, who were playing in his yard. And he's saying, \"what is our moral basis, for making a decision that\ncould kill these children? So they'll never write a poem, they'll never participate in election, they'll never run for office. How can we morally make a decision, that is going to eliminate\nlife for these beautiful kids?\" And he had said that to Khrushchev. And Khrushchev wrote\nthem this letter back, saying that he was now\nsitting at this dacha, on the Black Sea. And that he was thinking about, what my Uncle Jack had\nsaid to him at Vienna. And he regretted very\ndeeply, not having taken the olive leaf that Jack\nhad all offered him. And then he said, you\nknow, \"it occurs to me now, that we're all on an ark, and that there is not another one. And that the entire fate of the planet, and all of it's creatures\nand all of the children, are dependent on the decisions we make. And you and I have a moral obligation, to go forward with each other as friends.\" And immediately after\nthat, this was, you know, he sent that right after\nthe Berlin crisis in 1962, General Curtis LeMay tried to, had tried to provoke a war, with an incident at Checkpoint Charlie, which was the May, the entrance. The entrance exit, through\nthe Berlin Wall, in Berlin. And the Russian tanks\nhad come to the wall, the US tanks had come to the\nwall, and there was a standoff. And my uncle, had sent\na message to Khrushchev, and through Dobrynin saying,\n\"my back is at the wall. I cannot, I have no place\nto back, please back off. And then we will back off.\" And Khrushchev took his word,\nbacked his tanks off first, and then my uncle ordered LeMay to back. He had, LeMay had mounted bulldozer plows, on the front of the tanks to\nplow down the Berlin wall. And the Russians had come. So it was just, you know, it was his generals\ntrying to provoke a war. But they started talking\nto each other then. And then after he wrote that letter, they agreed that they\nwould install a hotline, so they could talk to each other, and they wouldn't have to\ngo through intermediaries. And so at Jack's house on the Cape, there was a red phone that\nwe knew if we picked it up, Khrushchev would answer. And there was another\none in the White House. - [Lex] Yeah. - But they knew it was\nimportant to talk to each other, you know, and you just wish, that we had that kind of leadership today, that can I, you know, that\njust understands our job. Look, I know you know\na lot about AI, right? And you know, how dangerous\nit is potentially, to humanity and what opportunities, it also, you know, offers. But it could kill us all. I mean, Elon said, \"first\nis gonna steal our job, then it's gonna kill us, right?\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And it's probably not hyperbole. It actually, you know, if it follows the laws of biological evolution, which are just the laws of mathematics, that's probably a good endpoint for it. You know, a potential endpoint. So it's gonna happen,\nbut we need to make sure it's regulated and it's\nregulated properly, for safety in every country. And, that includes Russia\nand China and Iran. Right now, we should be putting\nall the weapons of war aside and sitting down with\nthose guys and saying, \"how are we doing? How are we gonna do this?\" There's much more important things to do. This stuff is gonna kill us, if we don't figure out how to regulate it. And leadership needs to\nlook down the road at what, what is the real risk here? And the real risk is\nthat, you know, AI will, enslave us for one thing, you know, and then destroy us and\ndo all this other stuff. And how about biological weapons? We're now all working on\nthese biological weapons, and we're doing biological\nweapons from Ebola, you know, dengue fever and, you know, all of these other bad things. And we're making ethnic bio weapons, bio weapons that can only kill Russians, bio weapons that the Chinese\nare making that, you know, can kill people who\ndon't have Chinese genes. So all of this is now within\nreach, we're actively doing it, and we need to stop it. And we can easily, a\nbiological weapons treaty, is the easiest thing in the world to do. We can verify it, we can enforce it, and everybody wants to agree to it. Only insane people do not wanna, wanna continue this kind of research. There's no reason to do it. So there are these existential\nthreats to all of humanity, now out there, like AI and\npolitical, biological weapons. We need to star stop fighting each other, start competing on economic game fields, playing fields, instead of\nmilitary playing fields, which will be good for all of humanity. And that we need to sit\ndown with each other, and negotiate reasonable\ntreaties on how we regulate AI, and biological weapons. And nobody's talking about this, in this political race right now. Nobody's talking about it in a government. They get fixated on these\nlittle wars, you know, and these comic book\ndepictions of good versus evil, you know, and we all go, you know, hoorah, and go off to and give them\nthe weapons and enrich, you know, the military and Joshua complex, but we're on the road to\nperdition if we don't end this. - And some of this requires\nto have this kind of, phone that connects Khrushchev\nand John F. Kennedy, that cuts through all the bureaucracy. - [Robert] Yeah. - To have this communication, between heads of state\nand in the case of AI, perhaps heads of tech companies, where you can just pick up the phone, and have a conversation.\n- [Robert] Yes. - Because a lot of it, a lot of the existential threats\nof artificial intelligence, perhaps even bio weapons,\nis unintentional. It's not even strategic\nintentional effects. So you have to be\ntransparent and honest about, especially with AI, that\npeople might not know, what's the worst that's going to happen, once you release it out into the wild. And you have to have an\nhonest communication, about how to do it so that\ncompanies are not terrified of regulation, overreach of regulation. And then government is not\nterrified of tech companies, of manipulating them in some\ndirect or indirect ways. So like, there's a trust that\nbuilds, versus a distrust. That seems to, so\nbasically, that old phone, where Khrushchev can call\nJohn F. Kennedy is needed. - Yeah, and you know,\nI don't think there's, listen, I don't understand AI, okay. I do know, I can see\nfrom all this technology, how it's this kind of key totalitarianism, that once you put these\nsystems in place, you know, they can be misused to enslave people, and they can be misused in wars and, to subjugate, to kill, to\ndo all of these bad things. And I don't think there's anybody, on Capitol Hill who understands this. You know, we need to bring in\nthe tech community and say, \"tell us what these\nregulations need to look like,\" you know, so that there\ncan be freedom to innovate, so that we can milk AI for\nall of the good things, but not, you know, fall into\nthese traps that are gonna, you know, that are these\nexistential threats, that pose existential threats to humanity. - It seems like John F.\nKennedy is a singular figure, in that he was able to have\nthe humility to reach out to Khrushchev and also the strength, and integrity to resist\nthe, what did you call 'em? The salad brass and\ninstitutions like the CIA. So that makes it particularly\ntragic that he was killed. To what degree was CIA involved, or the various bureaucracy,\ninvolved in his death? - The evidence that the CIA was involved in my uncle's murder, and that they were subsequently\ninvolved in the coverup, and continue to be involved\nin the coverup, I mean, there's still 5,000 documents\nthat they won't release, you know, 60 years later is, I think, so insurmountable. And so, you know, mountainous\nand overwhelming that I, it's beyond any reasonable\ndoubt, including, you know, dozens of confessions of\npeople who were involved, in the assassination. But, you know, every kind of document, it came as a surprise\nrecently, to most Americans. I think the release of\nthese documents in which, the press, the American media, finally acknowledged that, yeah, Lee Harvey Oswald was the CIA asset, that he was recruited, you know, in 1957, he was Marine working at\nthe Tsui Air Force base, which was the CIA Air\nForce base in, you know, with the U2 flights,\nwhich was a CIA program. And that he was recruited\nby James Jesus Angleton, who was the director\nof counterintelligence, and then sent on a fake\ndefection to Russia, and then brought back,\nyou know, to Dallas. And people didn't know that even though, it's been known for decades. It never percolated into\nthe mainstream media, because they have such a, they have such an allergy to anything, that challenges the Warren Report. You know, when Congress\ninvestigated my uncle's murder, in the 1970s, the church committee did, and they did, you know, two\nand a half year investigation, and they had many, many more documents, and much more testimony available, to them than the Warren Commission had. And this was a decade after\nthe Warren Commission. They came to the conclusion, that my uncle was killed by a conspiracy. And there was a division\nwhere, essentially, one guy on that committee believed, it was primarily the mafia. But Richard Schweitzer, who was the senator head\nof the committee, said, straight out, \"the CIA\nwas involved in the murder of the President of the United States.\" So, and I've talked to most of\nthe staff on that committee, and they said, \"yeah, and the CIA was stonewalling us\nthe whole way through.\" And the actual people\nthat the CIA appointed, George Johan, who the CIA\nappointed as a liaison, to the committee, they\nbrought him out of retirement. He had been one of the\nmasterminds of the assassination. Oh, there's no, I mean, it's\nimpossible to even talk about, a tiny, the fraction of the evidence here. What I suggest to people, there are hundreds of\nbooks written about this, that, you know, assemble this evidence, and mobilize the evidence. The best book to me for people to read, is James Douglass's book, which\nis called \"The Unspeakable.\" And he, Douglass does this extraordinary, he is an extraordinary scholar, and he does this just an\namazing job of digesting, and summarizing and\nmobilizing all of them. You know, the probably a\nmillion documents and you know, the evidence from all these\nconfessions that have come out, into a coherent story,\nand it's riveting to read. And, you know, I recommend\npeople who do not take my word for it, you know, and don't\ntake anybody else's word, go ahead and do the research yourself. And one way to do that is, is probably the most efficient way, is to read Douglass's book. Because he has all the references there. - So if it's true that CIA had\na hand in this assassination, how is it possible for them\nto amass so much power? How is it possible for\nthem to become corrupt? And is it individuals or is\nit the entire institution? - No, it's not the entire institution. My daughter-in-law who's\nhelping to run my campaign, was a CIA, you know, in\nthe Clandestine services, for all her career. She was at Spy and Weapons\nof Mass Destruction program, in the Mid East and in China. And there's 22,000 people\nwho worked for the CIA. Probably 20,000 of those are, you know, are patriotic Americans and\nreally good public servants, and they're doing important\nwork for our country. But the institution is corrupt, and because the higher ranks\nthe institution, and in fact, Mike Pompeo said something\nlike this to me the other day, who was the director of the CIA. He said, \"when I was there, I did not do a good job of\ncleaning up that agency.\" And he said, \"the entire\nupper bureaucracy, of that agency are\npeople who do not believe in the institutions of democracy.\" This is what he said to me. So I don't know if that's\ntrue, but I know that, you know, that's significant. He's a smart person and he ran the agency, and he was the Secretary of State. But it's no mystery how that happened. We know the history. The CIA was originally, first of all, there was great reluctance\nin 1947 that we had, for the first time we\nhad a secret spy agency, in this country during\nWorld War II called the OSS. That was disbanded after the\nwar because Congress said, \"having a secret spy agency, is incompatible with a democracy.\" Secret spy agencies are\nthings that like the KGB the Stasi, East Germany,\nSlovakia and Iran, and Peep and Chile and whatever, you know, all over the world, they're all have to do with\ntotalitarian governments. They're not something\nthat you can have that, it's antithetical to\ndemocracy to have that. But... In 1947, we created, Truman signed it in, but it was initially, an espionage agency, which means information\ngathering, which is important. It's to gather and consolidate\ninformation from many, many different sources\nfrom all over the world. And then put those in reports, of the White House so the President, can make good decisions\nbased upon valid information, evidence-based, you know, decision making. But Alan Dulles, who was the, essentially the first head of the agency, made a series of legislative machinations, and political imaginations\nthat gave additional powers, to the agency and opened up the, what they called then, the plans division, which is, the plans division\nis the dirty tricks. It's the black ops fixing elections, murdering, what they\ncall executive action, which means killing foreign\nleaders and, you know, making small wars and bribing, and blackmailing people\nstealing elections, and that kind of thing. And the reason at that time, you know, we were in the middle of\nthe Cold War and Truman, and then Eisenhower did\nnot wanna go to war. They didn't wanna commit troops. And it seemed to them that, you know, this was a way of kind of\nfighting the Cold War secretly, without, and doing it at minimal cost, by changing events sort of invisibly. And so it was seductive to\nthem, but everybody, you know, Congress, when they\nfirst voted it in place, Congress, both political parties said, \"if we create this thing, it\ncould turn into a monster, and it could undermine our values.\" And today they, it's so powerful, and then nobody knows what its budget is. Plus it has its own\ninvestment fund, In-Q-Tel, which has invested, you know, made I think, 2,000\ninvestments in Silicon Valley. So it has ownership of a\nlot of these tech companies, that, you know, a lot of the\nCEOs of those tech companies, have signed state secrecy\nagreements with the CIA, which if they even reveal\nthat they have signed that, they can go to jail for 20 years, and have their assets removed, et cetera. The influence that the agency has, the capacity to influence\nevents at every level, in our country, is really frightening. And then, for most of its life, the CIA was banned from\npropagandizing Americans, but we learned that they\nwere doing it anyway. So in 1973, during the\nchurch committee hearings, we learned that the CIA had a program, called Operation Mockingbird, where they had at least 400 members, leading members of the\nUnited States Press Corps, on the New York Times,\nthe Washington Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, et cetera, who were secretly working for the agency, and steering news coverage\nto support CIA priorities. And they agreed at that time, to disband Operation Mockingbird in '73. But there's indications\nthey didn't do that. And they still, the CIA today, is the biggest funder of\njournalism around the world. The biggest funder is through USAID, the USA, the United\nStates funds journalism, in almost every country in the world. You know, it owns newspapers,\nit has journalists on it, thousands and thousands of\njournalists on its payroll. They're not supposed to be\ndoing that in the United States. But, you know, in 2016,\nPresident Obama changed the law, to make it legal now for the\nCIA to propagandize Americans. And I think, you know, we\ncan't look at the Ukraine war, and how that was, you know, has been how the\nnarrative has been formed, in the minds of Americans, and say that the CIA had\nnothing to do with that. - Well, what is the\nmechanism by which the CIA, influences the narrative, do you think? It's indirectly? - [Robert] Through the press. - Indirectly through the press, or directly by funding the press? - Directly through, I mean, there's certain press organs\nthat have been linked, you know, to the agency that the people who run those organs,\nthings like the Daily Beast, now Rolling Stone, you know,\neditor of Rolling Stone, Noah Shachtman has deep relationships, with the intelligence\ncommunity Salon, Daily Coasts. - But I wonder why they would do it. So from my perspective,\nit just seems like the job of a journalist is to have an integrity, where your opinion cannot\nbe influenced or bought. - I agree with you, but I actually think, that the entire field of\njournalism has, you know, really ashamed itself\nin recent years because, it's become, the principle of\nnewspapers in this country, and the television\nstation, the legacy media, have abandoned their traditional, their tradition of, which\nwas when I was a kid, my house was filled with the\ngreatest journalists alive, at that time, people like Ben\nBradley, like Anthony Lewis, Mary McLeod, Pete Hamill, Jack Newfield, Jimmy Breslin, and many, many others. And, after my father died, they started the RFK Journalism Awards, to recognize integrity\nand courage, you know, journalistic integrity and courage. And for that generation of journalism, they thought, they believed, that the function of journalists, was to maintain this posture of fear, skepticism toward any\naggregation of power, and including government\nauthority, that you always, that people in authority lie, and they always have to be questioned. And that their job was\nto speak truth to power, and to be guardians of\nthe First Amendment right, to the free expression. But if you look, what\nhappened during the pandemic, was the inverse of that\nkind of journalism where, the major press organs\nin this country were, instead of speaking truth to power, they were doing the opposite. They were broadcasting propaganda. They became propaganda organs\nfor the government agencies. And they were actually\ncensoring the speech of dissent, anybody who dissents of the powerless. Oh, and in fact, it was\nan organized conspiracy, you know, the name of it was\nthe Trusted News Initiative. And, some of the major\npress organs in our country, signed onto it, and they\nagreed not to print stories, or facts that departed\nfrom government orthodoxy. So the Washington Post was\na signature of the UPI, the AP and then the four media, or the four social media groups, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, and Google, all signed on to the\nTrusted News Initiative. It was started by the\nBBC, organized by them. And the purpose of it\nwas to make sure nobody could print anything about government, that departed from government orthodox, and the way it worked\nis the UPI and the AP, which are the news services\nthat provide most of the news, you know, news around the country. And the Washington Post would decide, what news was permissible to print. And a lot of it was about COVID, but also Hunter Biden's laptops. Where it was the impermissible to suggest, that those were real or that, you know, they had stuff on there\nthat was compromising. And, you know, and by the way, what I'm telling you\nis all well documented, and I'm litigating on it right now, so I'm part of a lawsuit against the DNI. And so I know a lot about what happened, and I have all this documented, and people can go to our website. There's a letter on my Substack now, to Michael Cher of the\nWashington Post that outlines all this and gives all my sources, because Michael Cher accused me, of being a conspiracy theorist, when he was actually part of a conspiracy, a true conspiracy, to suppress anybody, who was departing from\ngovernment orthodoxies, by either censoring them completely, or labeling them conspiracy theorists. - I mean, you can understand\nthe intention and the action, the difference between,\nas we talked about, you can understand the intention\nof such a thing being good, that in a time of a catastrophe\nand a time of a pandemic, there's a lot of risk\nto saying untrue things. But that's a slippery\nslope that leads into- - [Robert] Yeah. - A place where the\njournalistic integrity, that we talked about is\ncompletely sacrificed. And then you can deviate from truth. - If you read their internal memorandum, including the statements of the leader, of the Trusted News Initiative, I think her name's Jennifer Cecil, you know, you can go on our\nwebsite and see her statement. And she says, \"the purpose\nof this is that we're now,\" actually, she says,\n\"when people look at us, they think we're\ncompetitors, but we're not. The real competitors are\ncoming from all these, alternative news sources\nnow all over the network, and they're hurting public trust in us, and they're hurting our economic model. And they have to be\nchoked off and crushed. And the way that we're gonna\ndo that is to make an agreement with the social media\nsites that if we say, if we label their\ninformation misinformation, the social media sites will deplatform it, or they will throttle it,\nor they will shadow ban it,\" which destroys the economic model, of those alternative competitive\nsources of information. So that's true. But the point you make\nis an important point, that the journalists themselves, who probably didn't know\nabout the TNI agreement, certainly, I'm sure they didn't, they believe that they're\ndoing the right thing, by suppressing information\nthat may challenge, you know, government\nproclamations on COVID. But I mean, there's a danger to that. And the danger is that, you know, once you appoint yourself an arbiter, of what's true and what's not true, then there's really no end\nto the power that you have now assumed for yourself. Because now, your job is no\nlonger to inform the public. Your job now is to manipulate the public. And if you end up manipulating the public, in collusion with powerful entities, then you become the instrument\nof authoritarian rule, rather than the, you\nknow, the opponent of it. And it becomes the inverse of\njournalism and a democracy. - You're running for\npresident as a Democrat. What to you are the strongest\nvalues that represent the left wing politics of this country? - I would say protection\nof the environment, and the commons, you know,\nthe air, the water, wildlife, fisheries, public lands,\nyou know, those assets, they cannot be reduced to\nprivate property, ownership. You know, the landscapes,\nour Purple Mountain Majesty, the protection of the most\nvulnerable people in our society. People who, which would include\nchildren and minorities, the restoration of the\nmiddle class, you know, and protection of labor, dignity, and decent pay for labor. Bodily autonomy, a\nwoman's right to choose, or an individual's right to endure, unwanted medical procedures. Peace. You know, the Democrats\nhave always been anti-war. That the refusal to use\nfear is a governing tool. FDR said, \"the only thing we\nhave to fear is fear itself.\" 'Cause he recognized that\ntyrants and dictators, could use fear to disable\ncritical thinking, and overwhelm the desire\nfor personal liberty. The freedom of government\nfrom untoward influence, by corrupt corporate power, is the end of this corrupt merger, of state and corporate\npower that is now, I think, dominating our democracy. What Eisenhower warned about, when he warned against the emergence, of the military industrial complex. And then I prefer to talk about kind of, the positive revision of\nwhat we should be doing, in our country and globally,\nwhich is, you know, I see that the corporations\nare commoditizing us, or poisoning our children, or strip mining the wealth\nfrom our middle class, and treating America as if it\nwere business and liquidation, converting assets to cash\nas quickly as possible. And, you know, and creating\nor exacerbating this, this huge disparity in\nwealth in our country, which is eliminating the\nmiddle class and creating, you know, kind of a Latin\nAmerican style feudal model. There's these huge\naggregations of wealth above, and widespread poverty below. And that's a configuration\nthat is too unstable, to support democracy sustainably. You know, and we're supposed\nto be modeling democracy, but we're losing it. And I think we have ought\nto have a foreign policy, that restores our moral\nauthority around the world. Restores America as the\nembodiment of moral authority, in which it was when\nmy uncle was president. And as a purveyor of peace rather than, you know, a war like nation. My uncle said he didn't\nwant people in Africa, and Latin America and Asia, when they think of\nAmerica to picture a man, with a gun and a bayonet. He wanted them to think of\na Peace Corps volunteer. And he refused to send\ncombat veterans abroad, combat soldiers abroad. He never sent a single\nsoldier to his death abroad. And in, you know, into combat. He sent 16,000, he\nresisted, in Berlin in '62. He resisted in Laos. In '61, he resisted in Vietnam, you know, Vietnam, they wanted him\nto put 250,000 troops. He only put 16,000 advisors, which was fewer troops. And he sent to get James Meredith, into Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi. One Black man, he sent 16,000\nand a month before he died, he'd ordered them all home. He actually, I think it\nwas October 2nd, 1963, he heard that a Green Beret had died. And he asked his aid for a combat, for a list of combat fatalities. And the aid came back\nand there was 75 men, had died in Vietnam at that point. And he said, \"that's too many. We're gonna have no more.\" And he ordered, he signed\na national security order, 263, and ordered all of those men, all Americans home from Vietnam by 1965, with the first thousand\ncoming home by December '63. And then in November, he, of course, just before that evacuation\nbegan, he was killed. And a week later, President\nJohnson remanded that order. And then a year after that,\nthe Tonkin Gulf resolution, we sent 250,000, which is what they wanted my uncle to do, which he refused. And then, and it became an American war. And then Nixon, you know,\ntopped it off at 560,000, 56,000 Americans never came home, including my cousin George Skagel, who died at the Ted Offensive. And we killed a million Vietnamese, and we got nothing for it. - So America should be\nthe symbol of peace. - And you know, today, my uncle, you know, really focused on putting\nAmerica on the side of the poor. - [Lex] Yeah. - Instead of our tradition of, you know, of fortifying oligarchies\nthat were anti-communism. That was our major criteria, if you said you were against communists, and of course the people\nwere the rich people. Our aid was going to the rich\npeople in those countries, and they were going to the military juntas our weapons were going to the juntas, to fight against the poor. And my uncle said, \"no, you know, America should be on\nthe side of the poor.\" And so he launched the Alliance\nfor Progress and USAID, which were intended to bring\naid to the poorest people in those and build middle classes, and take ourselves away. In fact, his most, his favorite trip, his two favorite trips\nwhile he was president, his most favorite trip was to Ireland, this incredible emotional homecoming, for all of the people of Ireland. But his second favorite trip\nwas when he went to Columbia, he went to Latin America, but Columbia was his favorite country. And there were, I think\nthere were 2 million people, came into Bogota to see\nhim, this vast crowd. And they were just\ndelirious, cheering for him. And the president of Columbia,\nAlberto Lleras Camargo, said to him, \"do you\nknow why they love you?\" And my uncle said, \"why?\" And he said, \"'cause they\nthink you've put America, on the side of the poor,\nagainst the oligarchs.\" And you know, when my\nuncle, after he died, today, there are more\navenues and boulevards, and hospitals and schools named, and statues, named after\nand commemorating in parks, commemorating John Kennedy\nin Africa and Latin America, than any other president\nin the United States, and probably more than all\nthe other presidents combined. And it's because, you know, he put America on the side of the poor. And that's what we ought to be doing. We ought to be projecting\neconomic power abroad, the Chinese have essentially\nstolen his playbook. And you know, we've spent\n$8 trillion on the Iraq war, in its aftermath of wars in Syria, Yemen, Libya, you know, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and what do we get for that? We got nothing, for that money. $8 trillion we got, we killed more Iraqis, than Saddam Hussein. Iraq today is much worse off, than it was when Saddam was there. It's an incoherent violent war, between Shia and Sunni death squads. We pushed Iraq into the embrace of Iran. It's now become essentially\na proxy for Iran, which is exactly the outcome, that we were trying to prevent\nfor the past, you know, 20 or 30 years, we created ISIS, we sent 2 million refugees into Europe, destabilizing all of the nations\nin Europe for generations. And we're now seeing\nthese riots, in France. And that's a direct result\nfrom the Syrian war, that we created, and our creation of ISIS. Brexit is another, you\nknow, result of that. So we, for $8 trillion,\nwe wrecked the world. And during that same period\nthat we spent $8.1 trillion, bombing bridges, ports,\nschools, hospitals, that the Chinese spent $8.1\ntrillion building schools, ports, hospitals,\nbridges, and universities. And now, you know, the Chinese, are out competing us\neverywhere in the world. Everybody wants to deal\nwith the Chinese because, they, you know, they come in, they build nice things for you, and there's no strengths attached, and they're pleasant to deal with. And, you know, as a result of that, Brazil is switching to Chinese currency, Argentina is switching, Saudi Arabia, our greatest partner that,\nyou know, we put trillions of dollars into protecting\nour oil pipelines there. And now they're saying, you know, \"we don't care what the\nUnited States think.\" That's what Mohammed bin Salman said. He said, \"we don't,\" you know, he dropped oil production in Saudi Arabia, in the middle of a US inflation spiral. They've never done that to us before, to aggravate the inflation spiral. And two weeks later, and\nthen they signed a deal, a unilateral peace deal with Iran, which has been the enemy that\nwe've been telling them to, you know, to be a bulwark\nagainst for 20 years. And two weeks after that, he said, \"we don't care what the\nUnited States thinks anymore.\" So that's what we got for spending all those trillions of dollars there. We got short term friends and\nthe United States, you know, policy abroad, and we have\nnot made ourselves safer. We've made Americans, we've\nput Americans in more jeopardy, all over the world. You know, you have to wait\nin lines to get through the airport and you have to, you know, the security state is now\ncosting us $1.3 trillion, and America is unsafer and\npoorer than it's ever been. So, you know, we're not getting, we should be doing what President Kennedy said we ought to do. And what China, the policy\nthat China has now adopted. - So that's a really eloquent\nand clear and powerful, description of the way\nyou see US should be doing geopolitics and the way you see, US should be taking care of\nthe poor in this country. Let me ask you a question\nfrom Jordan Peterson, that he asked when I told him\nthat I'm speaking with you, given everything you've said, \"when does the left go too far?\" I suppose he's referring\nto cultural issues, identity politics. - Well, you know, Jordan trying to get me, to badmouth the left the\nwhole time, I was in, (laughs) I really enjoyed my talk with him. - [Lex] Yeah. - But he seemed to have that\nagenda where he wanted me to, you know, say bad things about the left. And I just, you know, that's\nnot what my campaign is about. I wanna do the opposite. Oh, I'm not gonna badmouth the left. They try, you know, I was on shows this\nweek with David Remnick, from the New Yorker, and he tried to get me to badmouth Donald Trump, you know, and Alex Jones\nand a lot of other people, and baiting me to do it. And of course there's a lot\nof bad things I could say, about all those people,\nbut it doesn't, you know, I'm trying to find, I'm trying to find values\nthat hold us together, that we can share in common rather than to focus constantly on these disputes, and these issues that drive us apart. So me sitting here badmouthing the left, or badmouthing the right is\nnot gonna advance the ball. I really wanna figure\nout ways that, you know, what do these groups hold\nin common that we can all, you know, have a shared vision of what we want this country to look like. - Well, that's music to my ears. But in that spirit, let me ask you a difficult question then. You wrote a book harshly\ncriticizing Anthony Fauci. Let me ask you, to steelman the case, for the people who support him. What is the biggest positive thing, you think Anthony Fauci did for the world? What is good that he\nhas done for the world, especially during this pandemic? - You know, I don't want to\nsit here and speak unfairly, by saying the guy didn't do anything, but I don't, I can't think of anything. I mean, if you tell me\nsomething that you think he did, you know, maybe there was\na drug that got licensed, while he was at NIH that,\nyou know, benefited people. That's certainly possible. He was there for 50 years and, in terms of of his principal programs, of the AIDS programs\nand his COVID programs, and I think that the harm\nthat he did vastly outweighs you know, the benefits. - Do you think he believes\nhe's doing good for the world? - I don't know what he believes. In fact, in that book, which\nis I think 250,000 words, I never try to look inside of his head. I deal with facts, I deal with science. So, and every factual\nassertion in that book, is cited and source to\ngovernment databases, or peer reviewed publications. And, I don't, I try not\nto speculate about things, that I don't know about or I can't prove. And I cannot tell you\nwhat his motivations were, or I mean, all of us. He's done a thing. A lot of things that I\nthink are really very, very bad things for\nhumanity, very deceptive. But we all have this\ncapacity for self deception. As I said, at the\nbeginning of this podcast, we judge ourselves on our intentions, rather than our actions. And we all have an\nalmost infinite capacity, to convince ourselves that\nwhat we're doing is right. And, you know, not\neverybody kind of lives, an examined life and is\nexamining their motivations, and the way that the\nworld might experience their professions of goodness. - Let me ask about the\ndifficulty of the job he had. Do you think it's possible\nto do that kind of job well, or is it also a fundamental\nflaw of the job, of being the centralized figure, that's supposed to a scientific policy? - No, no. I think he was a genuinely,\na bad human being. And that there were\nmany, many good people, in that department over the years. Bernice Eddie is a really good example. John Anthony Morris,\nmany people whose careers he destroyed because they\nwere trying to tell the truth. One after the other. The greatest scientists\nin the history of NIH, were run out of that\norganization, out of that agency. But, you know, people listening to this, probably, you know, will,\nin hearing me say that, will think that I'm bitter or that, I'm doctrinaire about him, but you know, you should really go and read my book. And it's hard to summarize a, you know, I tried to be really\nmethodical to not call names, to tell, to just say what happened. - You are, the bigger picture of this is, you're an outspoken critic, of pharmaceutical companies, big pharma. What is the biggest\nproblem with big pharma, and how can it be fixed? - Well, the problem could\nbe fixed with regulation, you know, the problems, but the pharmaceutical industry is, I mean, I don't wanna say, because this is gonna seem\nextreme, a criminal enterprise, but if you look at the\nhistory that is an applicable, characterization, for example, the four biggest vaccine makers, Sanofi, Merck, Pfizer, and Glaxo, four companies that make\nall of the 72 vaccines, that are now mandated,\neffectively mandated, for American children. Collectively, those companies\nhave paid $35 billion, in criminal penalties and\ndamages in the last decade. And I think since 2,000, about 79 billion. So these are the most corrupt\ncompanies in the world. And the problem is that\nthey're serial felons. They, you know, they do this\nagain and again and again. So they did Vioxx, you\nknow, Merck did Vioxx, which Vioxx, they killed\npeople by falsifying science. And they did it, they lied to the public. They said, this is a headache medicine, and a arthritis painkiller. But they didn't tell people that, it also gave you heart attacks. And they knew, you know,\nwe've found when we sued them, you know, the memos from\ntheir bean counters saying, \"we're gonna kill this many people, but we're still going to make money.\" So they make those calculations, and those calculations are\nmade very, very regularly. And then, you know, when they get caught, they pay a penalty. And I think they paid\nabout $7 billion for Vioxx, but then they went right\nback that same year, that they paid that penalty, they went back into the same\nthing again with Gardasil, and with a whole lot of other drugs. So the way that the system is set up, the way that it's sold to doctors, the way that, nobody ever goes to jail. So there's really no penalty that, it all becomes part of the\ncost of doing business. And you know, you can see other businesses\nthat if they're not, if there's no penalty, if there's no real, I mean these, look, these are the companies, that gave us the opioid epidemic, right? So they knew what was gonna\nhappen and we, you know, you go and see, there's a documentary, I forget what the name of it is, but it shows exactly what happened. And, you know, they corrupted FDA, they knew that this, that\noxycodone was addictive. They got FDA to tell doctors\nthat it wasn't addictive. They pressured FDA to lie. And they got their way. And they've, so far they\nled this year, you know, they got a whole generation\naddicted to oxycodone. And now, you know, when they\ngot caught and they made it, we made it harder to get oxycodone. And now all those addicted kids, are going to fentanyl and dying. And this year it killed 106,000. That's twice as many\npeople who were killed, during the 20 year Vietnam War. But in one year, twice many American kids. And they knew it was gonna happen, and they did it to make money. So I don't know what you\ncall that, other than saying, that's, you know, a criminal enterprise. - Or is it possible to have,\nwithin a capitalist system, to produce medication, to produce drugs at scale in a way that is not corrupt? - Of course it is. - [Lex] How? - Through, you know, through\na solid regulatory regimen, you know, where drugs are actually tested. You know, I mean the problem\nis, not the capitalist system, the capitalist system, you know, I have great admiration for that. Love the capitalist system, it's the greatest economic\nengine ever devised. But it has to be harnessed\nto a social purpose. Otherwise it's gonna,\nit leads us, you know, down the trail of oligarchy\nenvironmental destruction, you know, and commoditizing, poisoning, and killing human beings. That's what it will do, in the end. You need a regulatory structure, that is not corrupted by entanglements, financial entanglements with the industry. And we've set this up,\nthe way that this is, that the system is set up today, has created this system of\nregulatory capture on steroids. So almost 50% of FDA's budget, comes from pharmaceutical companies. The people who work at FDA are, you know, their money is coming,\ntheir salaries are coming, from pharma, half their salaries. So they're, you know, they know who their bosses are, and that means getting those drugs done, getting them out the door and approved, as quickly as possible, it's\ncalled fast track approval. And they pay 50% of FDA's budget, goes about 45% actually\ngoes to fast track approval. - Do you think money can buy integrity? - Oh yeah, of course it can. In the reg, yeah, I mean, that's not something\nthat is controversial. Of course it will. So, and then- - Slightly controversial to me, I would like to think\nthat science that will- - Well it may not be able\nto buy your integrity. I'm talking about population wide, I'm not talking about the individual. - But I'd like to believe that scientists, I mean, in general, a\ncareer of a scientist, is not a very high paying job. I'd like to believe that\npeople that go into science, that work at FDA, that work at NIH, are doing it for a reason, that's not even correlated\nwith money, really. - Yeah, and I think probably\nthat's why they go in there. But scientists are\ncorruptible and, you know, and the way that I can tell you that, is that I've brought over 500 losses, and almost all of 'em involve\nscientific controversies. And there are scientists\non both sides, in everyone. When we sued Monsanto, there was, on the Monsanto side,\nthere was a Yale scientist, a Stanford scientist,\nand a Harvard scientist. And on our side there\nwas a Yale, Stanford, and Harvard scientists. And they were telling, saying\nexactly the opposite things. In fact, there's a word for\nthose kind of scientists, who take money, for their opinion, and the word is biostitutes. And they are very, very common. And, you know, and I've\nbeen dealing 'em with them, my whole career, you know, I think it was Upton Sinclair that said, \"that it's very difficult\nto persuade a man of a fact, if the existence of that fact\nwill diminish his salary.\" And I think that's true for all of us. If they, you know, we find a\nway of reconciling ourselves, the things that are, to truths, actually, and worldviews that actually\nbenefit our salaries. Now, NIH has probably the worst system, which is that scientists who work for NIH, NIH itself, which used to be the premier gold standard scientific\nagency in the world, everybody looked at NIH and that. Today it's just an incubator\nfor pharmaceutical drugs. And, you know, that is\nthat gravity of economic self-interest because if you're, if NIH itself collects royalties, they have margin rights for the patents, on all the drugs that they work on. So with the Moderna vaccine, which they promoted\nincessantly and aggressively, NIH own 50% of that vaccine, is making billions and\nbillions of dollars on it. And there are four, at\nleast four scientists, that we know of, and\nprobably at least six at NIH, who themselves have margining\nrights for those patents. So if you are a scientist who work at NIH, you work on a new drug,\nyou then get margin rights, and you're entitled to\nroyalties of $150,000 a year, forever from that, forever. Your children, your children's children, as long as that product's on the market, you can collect royalties. So you have, you know, the\nModerna vaccine is paying for the top people at NIH, you know, some of the top regulators,\nit's paying for their boats, it's paying for their mortgages, it's paying for their\nchildren's education. And you know, you have to expect that, that in those kind of situations, the regulatory function would be subsumed, beneath the mercantile\nambitions of the agency itself. And the individuals who\nstand to profit enormously, from getting a drug to market. Those guys are paid by us, the taxpayer, to find problems with those\ndrugs before they get to market. But if you know that drug is\ngonna pay for your mortgage, you may overlook a little\nproblem, or even a very big one. And that's the problem. - You've talked about\nthat the media slanders you by calling you an anti-vaxxer, and you've said that\nyou're not anti-vaccine, you're pro safe vaccine. Difficult question. Can you name any vaccines\nthat you think are good? - I think some of the live virus vaccines, are probably, averting more\nproblems than they're causing. There's no vaccine that is,\nyou know, safe and effective. In fact- - Those are big words,\nwhat about the polio? - [Robert] Those are big words. - Can we talk about the p- - [Robert] Well, here's the problem. - Yes. - Here's the problem. The polio vaccine contained a, a virus called Simian virus 40, SV40. It's one of the most\ncarcinogenic materials, that is known to man. In fact, it's used now by\nscientists around the world, to induce tumors and rats\nand Guinea pigs and labs. But it was in that vaccine, 98 million people who got that vaccine. And my generation got it. And now you've had this\nexplosion of soft tissue cancers, in our generation that\nkilled many, many, many, many, many more people\nthan polio ever did. So if you say to me, did the, you know, the polio vaccine was\neffective against polio? I'm gonna say yes. And if you say to me, did\nit kill more people than, did it cause more deaths than averted? I would say, I don't know, because we don't have\nthe data on that, so. - But let's talk, well, you know, we kinda have to narrow\nin on, is it effective, against the thing it's supposed to fight? - Oh, well, a lot of them are,\nlet me give you an example. The most popular vaccine in the world, is the DTP vaccine diphtheria,\npertussis, and tetanus. It was used in this, introduced\nin this country around 1980. That vaccine caused so many injuries, (indistinct) which was the manufacturer, said to the Reagan administration, \"we are now paying $20 in\ndownstream liabilities, for every dollar that\nwe're making in profits, and we are getting out of the business, unless you give us permanent\nimmunity from liability.\" So the vaccine companies then were given, and by the way, Reagan said at that time, \"why don't you just\nmake the vaccine safe?\" And why is that? Because vaccines are inherently unsafe. They said unavoidably unsafe,\nyou cannot make them safe. And so when Reagan wrote\nthe bill and passed it, the bill says in its preambles, \"because vaccines are unavoidably unsafe.\" And the Bruce Woods case, which\nwas the Supreme Court case, that upheld that bill\nuses that same language, vaccines cannot be made safe. They're unavoidably unsafe,\nso this is what the law says. Now, I just wanna finish this story, 'cause this illustrates\nvery well, your question. The DTP vaccine was\ndiscontinued in this country, and it was discontinued in Europe, 'cause the so many kids\nwere being injured by it. However, the WHO and Bill Gates gives it to 161 million African\nchildren every year. And Bill Gates went to\nthe Danish government, and asked them to support\nthis program saying, \"we've saved 30 million kids, from dying from diphtheria,\ntetanus, and pertussis.\" The Danish government said,\n\"can you show us the data?\" And he couldn't. So the Danish government\npaid for a big study, with Novo Nordisk, which is a Scandinavian vaccine company in West Africa. And they went to West Africa\nand they looked at the DTP vaccine for 30 years\nof data and they hire, they retained the best vaccine\nscientists in the world, these kind of deities of\nAfrican vaccine program, Peter Abbey, Sigrid Morganson\nand a bunch of others. And they looked at 30 years\nof data for the DTP vaccine. And they came back and they\nwere shocked by what they found. They found that the vaccine\nwas preventing kids, from getting diphtheria,\ntetanus, and pertussis. But the girls who got that vaccine, were 10 times more likely to\ndie over the next six months, than children who didn't. Why is that? And they weren't dying from anything, anybody ever associated with the vaccine. They were dying of anemia,\nbilharzia, malaria, sepsis, and mainly pulmonary and\nrespiratory disease, pneumonia. And it turns out this, this is what the researchers found, who were all pro-vaccine by the way. They said that this vaccine\nis killing more children, than diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, prior to the introduction of the vaccine. And for 30 years nobody ever noticed it. The vaccine was providing protection, against those target illnesses, but it had ruined the\nchildren's immune systems. And they could not defend\nthemselves against random infections that were\nharmless to most children. - But isn't it nearly impossible, to prove that link, isn't it? - You can't prove the link, all you can do is for\nany particular interest, you can't, illness or death,\nyou can't prove the link. But you can show statistically, that there is, that if\nyou get that vaccine, you're more likely to die, over the next six months\nthan if you don't. And those studies unfortunately, are not done for any other vaccines. So for every other medicine, in order to get approval from the FDA, you have to do a placebo\ncontrol trial prior to licenser, where you look at health outcomes, among an exposed group,\na group that gets it, and compare those to a similarly situated group that gets a placebo. The only medical intervention\nthat does not receive, that does not undergo\nplacebo controlled trials, prior to licenser, are vaccines. Not one of the 72 vaccines\nthat are now mandated, for our children have ever undergone, a placebo controlled\ntrial prior to licenser. - So I should say that there's\na bunch, on that point, I've heard from a bunch of\nfolks that disagree with you. - Okay.\n- [Lex] Including polio. I mean, and that test testing\nis a really important point. Before licensure, placebo\ncontrol randomized trials, polio, received just that, against the saline placebo control. So, it seems unclear to me. I'm confused why you say that, that they don't go through that process. It seems like a lot of them do. - Here's the thing is that, I was saying that for many years, 'cause we couldn't find any. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And then in 2016, in March, I met President Trump, ordered Dr. Fauci to meet with me, and Dr. Fauci and Francis Collins. And I said to them, during that meeting, \"you have been saying that\nI'm not telling the truth, when I said not one of these has undergone a prior pre-licensing placebo control.\" And the polio may have\nhad one, post licensing. Most of 'em haven't. The polio may have, I don't know. But I said, \"our question\nwas prior to licenser, do you ever test these?\" And for honor, for safety, and by the way, I think the polio vaccine did undergo, a saline placebo trial, prior licensure, but not for safety, only for efficacy. So I'm talking about safety trials, now. Fauci told me that, he said,\n\"I can't find one now,\" he had a whole tray of files there. He said, \"I can't find now one\nnow, but I'll send you one.\" I said, \"just for any vaccines, send me one, for any of the 72 vaccines.\" He never did. So we sued the HHS and after\na year of stonewalling us, HHS came back and they gave us a letter, saying we have no\npre-licensing safety trial, for any of the 72 vaccines. And that the letter from HHS, which settled our lawsuit\nagainst them 'cause we had a FOIA lawsuit against them, is\nposted on CHD's website. So anybody can go look at it. So if CHD had, if HHS had any study, I assume they would've given it to us, and they can't find one. - Well, let me zoom out because, a lot of the details matter here. Pre-licensure, what does\nplacebo controlled mean? So this is, this probably requires, a rigorous analysis. And actually at this point, it would be nice for me\njust to give the shout out, to other people much smarter than me, that people should follow along\nwith Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Use their mind, learn and think. So one really awesome creator,\nI really recommend him, is Dr. Dan Wilson. He hosts the \"Debunk the Funk\" podcast. Vincent Racaniello, who hosts\n\"This Week in Virology.\" Brilliant guy, I've\nhad him on the podcast. Somebody you've been\nbattling with, is Paul Offit. Interesting Twitter, interesting books. People should read, understand,\nand read your books as well. And Eric Topol has a good\nTwitter and good books. And even Peter Hotez,\nI'll ask you about him. - And people should, because Paul Offit, had published a Substack\nrecently debunking, I think, my discussion with Joe Rogan, and we have published a\ndebunk of his debunking, and you know, so if you read his stuff, you should read-\n- [Lex] Read both. - Yes, you should read... And I would love to\ndebate any of these guys. - So, Joe Rogan proposed\njust such a debate, which is quite fascinating to see how much attention and how much\nfunding it garnered, the debate between you and Peter Hotez. Why do you think Peter rejected the offer? - I think it's, you know, again, I'm not gonna look into his\nhead, but what I will say is, if you're a scientist\nand you're making public recommendations based upon what you say is evidence-based science. You ought to be able to defend that. You ought to be able to\ndefend it in a public forum, and you ought to be able to defend it. against all, you know, all comers. And, you know, so you know,\nif you're a scientist, science is based on, is\nrooted in logic and reason. And if you can't use\nlogic and reason to defend your position, and by the way, I know almost all of\nthe studies, you know, I've written books on them\nand we've made a big effort, to assemble all of the\nstudies on both sides. And so I'm prepared to\ntalk about those studies, and I'm prepared to\nsubmit them in advance. You know, and for each of\nthe points, and by the way, I've done that with Peter Hotez. You know, I've actually,\nbecause I had this, this kind of informal debate\nwith him several years ago, with him, with a referee at that time. And we were debating not only by phone, but by email and on those emails. Every point that he would\nmake, I would cite science, and he could never come back with science. He could never come\nback with publications. He would give publications\nthat had nothing to do with, for example, Thimerosal and vaccines, mercury based vaccines. He sent me one time, 16\nstudies to rebut something I'd said about Thimerosal. And not one of those studies, they were all about the MMR vaccine, which doesn't contain Thimerosal. So it wasn't like a real\ndebate where you're, you know, you're using\nreason and isolating points, and having a, you know,\na rational discourse. I don't think that he, I don't blame him for not debating me, because I don't think he has the science. - Are there aspects of all the\nwork you've done on vaccines, all the advocacy you've done, that you found out that\nyou were not correct on, that you were wrong on, that\nyou've changed your mind on? - Yeah, there are many times, over a time that I, you know, I found that I've made mistakes, and we correct those mistakes. You know, I run a big organization\nand I do a lot of tweets, you know, I'm very careful. For example, my Instagram, I was taken down from for misinformation, but there was no\nmisinformation on my Instagram. Everything that I cited on\nInstagram was cited or sourced, to a government database or\nto peer reviewed science. But for example, The Defender, which was our organization's newsletter, we summarized scientific\nreports all the time. That's one of the things,\nthe services that we provide. So we watch the, you know, PubMed, and we watch the peer\nreviewed publications, and we summarize them when they come out. We have made mistakes. When we make mistake, we are rigorous, about acknowledging it, apologizing\nfor it, and changing it. That's what we do. I think we have one of the most robust fact checking operations\nanywhere in journalism today. We actually do real science. And you know, there, listen, I've put up on my Twitter\naccount, there are numerous times that I've made mistakes on\nTwitter and I apologize for it. And people say to me, you\nknow, \"oh, that's weird. I've never seen anybody\napologize on Twitter.\" But I think it's really\nimportant at the only, of course, human beings make mistakes. My book is, you know,\n230 or 40, 50,000 words. There's gonna be a mistake in there. But you know what I say at\nthe beginning of the book, if you see a mistake in\nhere, please notify me. I give a way that people can notify me. And if somebody points out a\nmistake, I'm gonna change it. I'm not gonna dig my feet\nin and say, you know, I'm not gonna acknowledge this. - So some of the things\nwe've been talking about, you've been an outspoken contrarian, on some very controversial topics. This has garnered some\nfame and recognition, in part for being attacked\nand standing strong, against those attacks, if I\nmay say, for being a martyr. Do you worry about this drug of martyrdom, that might cloud your judgment? - First of all, yeah. I don't consider myself a martyr, and I have never\nconsidered myself a victim. I make choices about my life. And I'm content with those\nchoices and peaceful with them. I'm not trying to be a martyr\nor a hero or anything else. I'm doing what I think is right, 'cause I wanna be\npeaceful inside of myself. But, the only guard I have is just, you know, fact-based reality. If you show me a scientific\nstudy that shows that I'm wrong, for example, if you come back and say, \"look, Bobby, here's a polio, here's a safety study on polio\nthat was done pre-licensing, and use an a real saline solution,\" I'm gonna put that on my Twitter, and I'm gonna say I was wrong. There is one out there. So, you know, but that's all I can do. - All right, I have to ask,\nyou are in great shape. Can you go through your\ndiet and exercise routine? - I do intermittent fasting. So I eat between noon. I start at my first meal at around noon, and then I try to stop\neating at six or seven. And then I hike every day. - [Lex] Morning, evening? - In the morning. I go to a meeting, first\nthing in the morning, 12 seven meeting. And then I go hike for, and\nI hike uphill for a mile, and a half up and a mile\nhalf down with my dogs. And I do my meditations. And then I go to the gym and I\ngo to the gym for 35 minutes. I do it short time. I've been exercising for 50 years. And what I've found is it's sustainable. If, you know, if I do\njust a short periods, and I do four different\nroutines at the gym, and I never relax at the gym, I go in there and I have\na very intense exercise. And I live, you know, I mean, I could tell you what my routine is, but I do backs one day, chest one day, legs and then\na miscellaneous, and I do 12. My first set of everything\nis, is I try to, I try to reach failure at 12 reps. And then my fourth set of\neverything is a strip set. I do, I take a lot of vitamins. I can't even list them to you here, 'cause I couldn't even\nremember 'em at all. But I take a ton of\nvitamins and nutrients. I take, I'm on an anti-aging protocol, from my doctor that includes\ntestosterone replacement. But I don't take any steroids. I don't take any anabolic\nsteroids or anything like that. And the DRTI use is bioidentical\nto what my body produced. - What are your thoughts on\nhormone therapy in general? - I talk to a lot of doctors\nabout that stuff, you know, 'cause I'm interested\nin health and, you know, I've heard really good things\nabout it, but I don't know, I'm definitely not an expert on it. - About God, you wrote, \"God talks to human beings\nthrough many vectors, wise people, organized religion, the great books of religions, through art, music, and poetry. But nowhere with such\ndetailing grace and joy, as through creation,\nwhen we destroy nature, we diminish our capacity\nto sense the divine.\" What is your relationship, and what is your understanding\nof God, who's God? - Well, I mean, God is\nincomprehensible, you know, I mean, I guess the most\nphilosophers would say we're, you know, we're inside the mind of God. And so it would be impossible\nfor us to understand, you know, what actually, you know, what God's form is. But I mean, for me, I\nhave a, let's say this. I was raised in a very, very\ndeeply religious setting. So we went to church in the\nsummer, oftentimes twice a day, morning mass, and we went to, we definitely went every Sunday. And I went, we prayed in the morning, we prayed before and after\nevery meal, we prayed at night, we said a rosary, sometimes\nthree rosaries a night. And my father read us the Bible. Whenever he was a home, he\nwould read us, you know, we'd all get in the bed and\nhe'd read us the Bible stories. And I went to Catholic schools,\nI went to Jesuit schools, I went to the nuns and I\nwent to a Quaker school, at one point. I became a drug addict when\nI was about 15 years old, about a year after my dad died. And I was addicted to drugs for 14 years. During that time, when you're an addict, you're living against conscience. And when you're living, and I never, you know, I was always\ntrying to get off of drugs, never able to, but I never felt\ngood about what I was doing. And when you're living against conscious, you kind of push God to the\nperipheries of your life. So I'll call him he,\nrecedes and gets smaller. And then when I, when I got sober, I knew that I had a couple of experiences. One is that I had a friend of my brothers, one of my brothers who died\nof this disease of addiction, had a good friend who had\nused to take drugs with us. And he became a moonie. So, he became a follower\nof Reverend Sun Myung Moon. And he's at that point, his compulsion. He had the same kind of\ncompulsion that I had, and yet it was completely\nremoved from him. And so, and he used to\ncome and hang out with us, but he would not wanna take drugs. Even if I was taken right in front of him, he was immune to it, he'd become\nimpervious to that impulse. And, when I first got sober, I knew that I did not wanna be the kind of person who was, you know, waking up every day in white\nknuckling sobriety and just, you know, trying to resist,\nresist through willpower. And by the way, I had\niron willpower as a kid. I gave up candy for Lent when I was 12. And I didn't eat it again\nuntil I was in college. I gave up desserts the next year for Lent. And I didn't ever ate another\ndessert till I was in college. And I was trying to bulk up\nfor rugby and for sports. So I felt like I could do\nanything with my willpower. But somehow this\nparticular thing, you know, the addiction, I was\ncompletely impervious to it. And it was cunning, baffling,\nbaffling, incomprehensible. I could not understand why\nI couldn't just say no, and then never do it again like\nI did with everything else. And so I was living against conscience, and I thought about this\nguy and I, you know, reflecting my own prejudices\nat that time in my life, I said to myself, I didn't wanna be, I didn't wanna be like a drug addict, who was wanting a drug all the time, and just not being able to do it. I wanted to completely realign myself, so that I was somebody\nwho got up every day, and just didn't wanna take\ndrugs, never thought of them, you know, kissed the wife and\nchildren, and went to work, and never thought about\ndrugs the whole day. And I knew that people\nthroughout history had done that. You know, I'd read the\nlives of the saints. I knew St. Augustine had had a very, very dissolute youth and, you know, had the spiritual\nrealignment transformation. I knew the same thing had happened, to the St. Paul, you know, at Damascus. The same thing had happened. St. Francis, St. Francis also had a\ndissolute and fun loving youth, and had this deep spiritual realignment. And I knew that that happened\nto people throughout history, and I thought that's what I needed. You know, something like that. I had the example of this friend of mine, and I used to think about him. And I would think this again reflects, the bias and the, you know, probably the meanness\nof myself at that time. But I said, I'd rather\nbe dead than be a moonie. But I wish I somehow\ncould distill that power, that he got without becoming\na religious nuisance. And at that time I picked\nup a book by Carl Jung, called \"Synchronicity.\" And Jung, he was a psychiatrist, he was contemporary of\nFreud's, Freud was his mentor. And, Freud wanted him\nto be his replacement. But Freud was atheist and Jung\nwas a deeply spiritual man. He had these very intense and genuine, spiritual experiences from\nwhen he was a little boy, from really was three years old, that he remembers biography is fascinating about him 'cause he remembers\nhim with such a detail. And he had written, he was always, he was in interesting to me, because he was very faithful scientist. And I considered myself\na science-based person, from when I was little. And yet he had this\nspiritual dimension to him, which infused all of\nhis thinking and really, I think made him, you know, branded his form of\nrecovery or of treatment. And he thought that he had\nthis experiment experience, that he describes in this book, where he's sitting up on the third, he ran one of the biggest\nsanitariums in Europe in Zurich. And he was sitting up on the\nthird floor of this building, and he's talking to a patient, who was talking describing\nher dream to him. And the fulcrum of that\ndream was a scarab beetle, which was an insect that is not, is very, very uncommon, if at\nall in northern Europe, but it's a common figure\nin the iconography, of Egypt and the hieroglyphics, on the walls of the pyramids, et cetera. And he, while he was talking to her, he heard this bing, bing,\nbing on the window behind him, and he didn't want to turn around, to take his attention off her. But finally he does it. He, in exasperation, he turns around, he throws up the window and\nhis scarab beetle flies in, lands in his head and he\nshows it to the woman. And he says, \"is this\nwhat you were thinking of? Is this what you were dreaming about?\" And he was struck by that experience, which was similar to other\nexperiences he's had like that. And that's what synchronicity means. It's an incident or coincidence, you know? And like if you're talking with somebody, about somebody that you haven't\nthought about in 20 years, and that person calls on the\nphone, that's synchronicity. Oh, and he believed it was a way that God intervened in our lives that broke all the rules of nature\nthat he had set up, the rules of physics,\nthe rules of mathematics, or, you know, to reach\nin and sort of tap us on the shoulder and say, I'm here. And, so he tried to reproduce\nthat in a clinical setting, and he would put one guy in one room, and another guy in another\nroom and have them flip cards. And guess what the other guy had flipped. And he believed that if he could beat the laws of chance, laws of mathematics, that he would approve the existence, of an unnatural law, a supernatural law. And that was the first step, to proving the existence of a God. He never succeeds in doing it. But he says in the book,\n\"even though I can't prove using empirical and scientific tools, the existence of a God, I can show through anecdotal evidence, having seen thousands of patients come through this institution, that people who believe\nin God get better faster, and that the recovery is more enduring, than people who don't.\" And for me, hearing\nthat was more impactful, than if he had claimed that he had proved the existence of a God. Because I wouldn't have believed that. But, I was already at a\nmindset where I would've done anything I could to improve my chances, of never having to take\ndrugs again by even 1%. And if believing in God was gonna help me, whether there's a god up there or not, believing in one's self\nhad the power to help me, I was gonna do that. So then the question is, how do you start believing in something, that you can't see or\nsmell or hear or touch. or taste or acquire with your senses? And Jung provides the formula for that. And he says, \"act as if, you\nfake it till you make it.\" And so that's, you know,\nwhat I started doing, I just started pretending there was a God, watching me all the time. And kind of, life was a series of tests, and each, there was a\nbunch of moral decisions, that I had to make every day. And each one, you know, these were all just\nlittle things that I did. But each one now for me\nhad a moral dimension. Like when I, you know,\nwhen the alarm goes off, do I lay in bed for an extra 10 minutes, with my indolent thoughts or\ndo I jump right outta bed? Do I make my bed, most\nimportant decision of the day? Do I hang up the towels? You know, do I, when I go into the closet, and pull out my blue\njeans, and a bunch of those wire hangers fall on the ground, do I shut the door and say, \"too much, I'm too important to do that. That's somebody else's job,\" or not. And so, do I put the\nwater in the ice tray, before I put in the freezer? Do I put the shopping cart\nback in the, you know, place that it's supposed to go, in the parking lot of the Safeway? And if I make a whole bunch\nof those choices right, that I maintain myself in\na posture of surrender, which keeps me open to the\npower, to my higher power, to my God, and when I, when\nI do those things right, when I, you know, so much about addiction, is about abuse of power, you know, abuse of, all of us have some power, whether it's our, you know, good looks, or whether it's, you know,\nconnections or education, or family or whatever. And there's always a\ntemptation to use those to fill, fulfill self will. And the challenge is how\ndo you use those always, to serve instead, God's will and the, you know, the good of our community. And that to me is kind of the struggle. And, when I do that, I feel, I feel God's power coming through me, and that I can do things. I'm much more effective as a human being. That that gnawing, you know,\nanxiety that I lived with, for so many years in my gut, it's gone. And that I can kind of\nlike put down the oars, and hoist the sail and you\nknow, and the wind takes me, and I can see the\nevidence of it in my life. And you know, the big thing, temptation for me is that, when all these good things\nstart happening in my life, and the cash and prizes\nstart flowing in, you know, how do I maintain that\nposture of surrender? How do I stay surrender\nthen when my inclination, is to say to God, \"thanks\nGod, I got it from here.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And drive the car off the cliff again. And so, you know, I had\na spiritual awakening, and my desire for drugs and\nalcohol was lifted miraculously. And it, to me, it was as\nmuch a miracle as if I had, if I'd been able to walk on water. 'Cause I had tried everything earnestly, sincerely and honestly for\na decade to try to stop it, and I could not do it\non under my own power. And then all of a sudden\nit was lifted effortlessly, and you know, so I saw that evidence, early evidence of God in my life, of the power and and I see it now, you know, every day in my life. - So adding that moral dimension, to all of your actions\nis how you were able to win that Camus battle\nagainst the absurd. - [Robert] Exactly. - Sisyphus with the boulder. - It's all the same thing. It's the battle to just\nto do the right thing. - Now Sisyphus was able\nto find somehow happiness. - [Robert] Yeah. (Lex laughs) - Well, Bobby, thank you for the stroll, through some of the\nmost important moments, in recent human history and\nfor running for president. And thank you for talking today. - Thank you Lex. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words, from John F. Kennedy. \"Let us not seek the Republican answer, or the Democratic answer,\nbut the right answer. Let us not seek to fix\nthe blame for the past. Instead, let us accept our own responsibility for the future.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
