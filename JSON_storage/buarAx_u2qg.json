      "text": "- If the goal is the\nproject of human knowledge, which is to know the world as it is, you cannot know the world as it is without knowing what people really think and what people really think is an incredibly important fact to know. So every time you're actually\nsaying \"you can't say that\" you're actually depriving\nyourself of the knowledge of what people really think. You're causing what Timur Kuran, who's on our Board of Advisor, it's called preference falsification. You end up with an inaccurate\npicture of the world, which by the way, in a lot of cases, because there are activists who want to restrict more speech, they actually tend to think\nthat people are more prejudice than they might be. And actually one very real practical way it makes things worse is\nwhen you censor people, it doesn't change their opinion, it just encourages them to\nnot share it with people who will get them in trouble. So it leads them to talk to people who they already agree with and group polarization takes off. - The following is a\nconversation with Greg Lukianoff, free speech advocate,\nfirst-amendment attorney, president and CEO of FIRE, the Foundation for Individual\nRights and Expression. And he's the author of\n\"Unlearning Liberty\", co-author with Jonathan Haidt of \"Coddling of the American Mind\" and co-author with Rikki Schlott of a new book coming out in October that you should definitely\npre-order now called \"The Canceling of the American Mind\" which is a definitive\naccounting of the history, present and future of cancel culture. A term used and overused\nin public discourse, but rarely studied and understood\nwith the depth and rigor that Greg and Ricky do in this book and in part in this conversation. Freedom of speech is important, especially on college campuses, the very place that should serve as the battleground of ideas, including weird and controversial ones that should encourage bold\nrisk-taking, not conformity. This is a Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Greg Lukianoff."

      "section": "Cancel culture & freedom of speech",
      "text": "Let's start with a big question. What is cancel culture? Now, you've said that you don't\nlike the term as it's been, quote, dragged through the\nmud and abused endlessly by a whole host of controversial figures. Nevertheless, we have\nthe term, what is it? - Cancel culture is the\nuptick of campaigns, especially successful campaigns starting around 2014 to\nget people fired, expelled, deplatformed, et cetera, for speech that would\nnormally be protected by the First Amendment. And I always say would be protected because we're talking about\ncircumstances in which it isn't necessarily where\nthe First Amendment applies. But what I mean is like\nas an analog to say things you couldn't lose your\njob as a public employee for, and also the climate of fear that's resulted from that phenomenon, the fact that you can lose your job for having the wrong opinion. And it wasn't subtle that\nthere was an uptick in this, particularly on campus around 2014. John Ronson wrote a book called, \"So You've Been Publicly Shamed.\" It came out in 2015 already\ndocumenting this phenomena. I wrote a book called\n\"Freedom from Speech\" in 2014 but it really was in 2017 when you started seeing this\nbe directed at professors. And when it comes to\nthe number of professors that we've seen be targeted\nand lose their jobs. I've been doing this for 22 years and I've seen nothing like it. - So there's so many things\nI want to ask you here. But one, actually, just looking\nat the organization of FIRE, can you explain what the organization is because it's interconnected\nto this whole fight in the rise of cancel culture, in the fight for freedom of speech since 2014 and before. - So FIRE was founded in\n1999 by Harvey Silverglate. He is a famous civil liberties attorney. He's been on the show. He's the person who actually found me out in my very happy life\nout in San Francisco, but knew I was looking\nfor a first-amendment job. I'd gone to law school\nspecifically to do First Amendment. And he found me, which was pretty cool. His protege, Kathleen Sullivan was the dean of Stanford Law School and this remains the best\ncompliment I ever got in my life, is that she recommended me to Harvey. And since that's the whole\nreason why I went to law school, I was excited to be a part\nof this new organization. The other co-founder of\nFIRE is Alan Charles Kors. He's just an absolute genius. He is one of the leading\nexperts in the world on the enlightenment, and\nparticularly about Voltaire. And if any of your listeners\ndo like the great courses, he has a lecture on Blaise Pascal, and Blaise, of course, is\nfamous for the Pascal's wager. And I left it just so moved and impressed and with a depth of understanding of how important this person was. - That's interesting. You mentioned to me\noffline, connected to this, that at least it runs in parallel or there's a connection\nbetween the love of science and the love of the freedom of speech. - [Greg] Yes. - Can you maybe elaborate\nwhere that connection is? - Sure. I think that for those of\nus who are really, you know, have devoted our lives\nto freedom of speech, one thing that we are into,\nwhether we know it or not, is epistemology, the study\nand philosophy of knowledge. Freedom speech has lots of moral and philosophical dimensions, but from a pragmatic\nstandpoint, it is necessary because we're creatures of\nincredibly limited knowledge. We are incredibly self deceiving. I always love the fact that\nyou've all heard Harari refers to the enlightenment\nas the discovery of ignorance, because that's exactly what it was. It was suddenly being like,\nwow, hold on a second. All this incredibly\ninteresting folk wisdom we got which by the way can be\nsurprisingly reliable here and there when you start testing,\na lot of it is nonsense. And it doesn't hold up, even our ideas about the way things fall. As you know, Galileo established,\nlike even our intuitions, they're just wrong. And so a lot of the early\nhistory of freedom of speech, it was happening at the same time as sort of the scientific revolution. So a lot of the early debates\nabout freedom of speech were tied in. So certainly Galileo. I always point out like Kepler was probably like the\neven more radical idea that there weren't even perfect spheres. But at the same time, largely because of the\ninvention of the printing press, you also had all these\npolitical developments. And you know, I always talk\nabout Jan Hus, a famous Czech, the hero who was burned at\nthe stake and I think in 1419, but he was basically Luther\nbefore the printing press, before Luther could get his word out. He didn't stand a chance. And that was exactly what Jan Hus was. But a century later, thanks\nto the printing press, everyone could know what Luther thought. And boy did they. But it led to of course, this completely crazy\nhyper disrupted period in European history. - Well, you mentioned to\njump around a little bit, the First Amendment. First of all, what is the First Amendment and what is the connection to you between the First Amendment, the freedom of speech and cancel culture? - Sure. So I'm a First Amendment\nlawyer as I mentioned, and that's my passion. That's what I studied. And I think American First Amendment law is incredibly interesting. In one sentence, the First Amendment is\ntrying to get rid of basically all the reasons why humankind had been killing each other\nfor its entire existence. That we weren't going to\nfight anymore over opinion, we weren't gonna fight\nanymore of religion. That you have the right to\napproach your government for redress grievances. That you have the freedom to associate, that all of these things\nin one sentence we're like, \"Nope, the government\nwill no longer interfere with your right to have these\nfundamental human rights. And so one thing that makes\nFIRE a little different from other organizations is however, we're not just a First\nAmendment organization. We are a free speech organization. But at the same time, a lot of what I think free\nspeech is, can be well explained with reference to a lot\nof First Amendment law. Partially because in American history, some of our smartest people have been thinking about\nwhat the parameters of freedom of speech are in relationship to the First Amendment. And a lot of those principles, they transfer very well\njust as pragmatic ideas. So like the biggest sin\nin terms of censorship is called viewpoint discrimination. That essentially you\nallow freedom of speech except for that opinion. And it's found to be\nkind of more defensible and I think this makes sense that if you set up a forum and like we're only gonna\ntalk about economics to exclude people who wanna\ntalk about a different topic. But it's considered\nrightfully a bigger deal if you've set up a forum for economics. But we're not gonna let people talk about that kind of economics or have that opinion on\neconomics most particularly. So a lot of the principles\nfrom First Amendment law actually make a lot of philosophical sense as good principles for\nwhen, like what is protected and unprotected speech, what should get you in trouble,\nhow you actually analyze it, which is why we actually\ntry in our definition of cancel culture to work in some of the First Amendment\nnorms just in the definition. So we don't have to bog\ndown on them as well. - You're saying so many\ninteresting things, but if you can linger on the\nviewpoint discrimination, is there any gray area\nof discussion there? Like what is and isn't economics\nfor the example you gave? - [Greg] Yeah. - I mean is it a science, or is it an art to draw lines\nof what is and isn't allowed? - Yeah. You know, if you're\nsaying that something is or is not economics, well you can say everything's economics and therefore I want to talk about poetry. There'd be some line\ndrawing exercise in there, but let's say once you decide\nto open up, to poetry even it's a big difference between saying, okay, now we're open to\npoetry, but you can't say, you know, Dante was bad. Like that's a forbidden\nopinion now officially in this otherwise open forum that would immediately\nat an intuitive level strike people as a bigger problem than just saying that\npoetry isn't economics. - I mean, that intuitive\nlevel that you speak to, I hope that all of us have\nthat kind of basic intuition when a line is crossed. It's the same thing for like pornography. - Yes. - When you see it, I think there's the\nsame level of intuition that should be applied\nacross the board here. And it's when that\nintuition becomes deformed by whatever forces of society, that's when it starts\nto feel like censorship. - Yeah I mean, people\nfind it a different thing. If someone loses their job simply for their political opinion, even if that employer has every right in the world to fire you, I think Americans should\nstill be like, well it's true. They have every right in the world. And I'm not making a legal case that maybe you shouldn't fire someone for their political opinion,\nbut think that through. Like, what kind of society\ndo we wanna live in? And it's been funny watching,\nand I point this out, yes, I will defend businesses, First Amendment rights of association to be able to have the legal right to decide who works for them. But from a moral or philosophical matter, if you think through the implications of, if every business in America becomes an expressive association in addition to being a profit\nmaximizing organization, that would be a disaster for democracy because you would end up in a situation where people would actually\nbe saying to themselves, I don't think I can actually\nsay what I really think and still believe I can keep my job. And that's where I was worried,\nI felt like we were headed 'cause a lot of the initial response to people getting\ncanceled was very simply, oh, but they have the right\nto get rid of this person and that's the beginning\nand end of the discussion. And I thought that was a dodge, I thought that wasn't\nactually a very serious way that if you care about\nboth the First Amendment and the freedom of speech,\nof thinking it through. - So to you, just to clarify, the First Amendment is\nkind of a legal embodiment of the ideal of freedom of speech and then freedom of speech. - As applied to government. - And it's very specific,\napplied to government and freedom of speech is the\napplication of the principle to like everything including like kind of the high level philosophical ideal of the value of people being\nable to speak their mind. - Yeah, it's an older,\nbolder, more expansive idea. And you can have a situation, and I talk about countries\nthat have good free speech law, but not necessarily great\nfree speech culture. And I talk about how when we\nsometimes make this distinction between free speech law\nand free speech culture, we're thinking in a\nvery cloudy kind of way. And what I mean by that\nis that laws generally, particularly in a common law country, it's the reflection of norms. Judges are people too. And in a lot of cases, common law is supposed to\nactually take our intuitive ideas of fairness and place them into the law. So if you actually have a culture that doesn't appreciate free speech from a philosophical standpoint, it's not going to be able\nto protect free speech for the long haul, even in\nthe law 'cause eventually, that's one of the reasons\nwhy I worry so much about some of these terrible\ncases coming out of law schools because I fear that even though, sure, American First Amendment law is very strongly protective\nof First Amendment for now, it's not gonna stay that way. If you have generations\nof law students graduating who actually think there's nothing, there's no higher goal than shouting down you're an opponent. - Yeah, so that's why\nso much of your focus, or a large fraction of your\nfocus is on the higher education or education period, is because education is\nthe foundation of culture. - Yeah, you have this\nhistory, you know, '64, you have the free speech\nmovement on Berkeley, and in '65 you have Repressive\ntolerance by Herbert Marcuse, which was a declaration of,\nby the way, we on the left, we should have free speech, but we should have free speech for us. I mean, I went back and\nreread repressive tolerance and how clear it is. I had forgotten that it\nreally is kind of like, and these so-called\nconservatives and right wingers, we need to repress them because\nthey're regressive thinkers. It really doesn't come out to\nanything more sophisticated than the very old idea\nthat our people are good, they get free speech, they should keep it. Other side bad. We should not have, and we\nhave to retrain society. And of course, like, it\nends up being another, he was also a fan of Mao,\nso it's not surprising that of course the\nsystem would have to rely on some kind of totalitarian system. But that was a laughable\nposition, you know, say 30, 40 years ago. The idea that essentially, you know, free speech for me, not for the... As the great free speech\nchampion Hentoff used to say was something that you were\nsupposed to be embarrassed by. But I saw this when I\nwas in law school in '97. I saw this when I was\ninterning at the ACLU in '99, that there was a slow\nmotion train wreck coming that essentially there was\nthese bad ideas from campus that had been taking\non more and more steam of basically no free\nspeech for my opponent were actually becoming\nmore, more and more accepted and partially because academia was becoming less and\nless viewpoint diverse. I think that as my co-author\nJonathan Haidt points out that when you have low\nviewpoint diversity, people start thinking in\na very kind of tribal way. And if you don't have\nthe respected dissenters, you don't have the people\nthat you can point to that are like, \"Hey,\nthis is a smart person.\" This is a smart, reasonable, decent person that I disagree with. So I guess not everyone\nthinks alike on this issue. You start getting much more\nkind of like only bad people, only heretics, only\nblasphemers, only right wingers can actually think in this way."

      "section": "Left-wing vs right-wing cancel culture",
      "text": "- Every time you say something, I always have a million thoughts and a million questions that pop up. But since you mentioned\nthere's a kind of drift as you write about in the\nbook and you mentioned now there's a drift towards\nthe left in academia, which would also maybe\ndraw a distinction here between the left and the right and the cancel culture as\nyou present in your book is not necessarily associated with any one political viewpoint. That there's mechanisms on both sides. - [Greg] Oh yeah. - That result in cancellation and censorship in violation\nof freedom of speech. - So one thing I wanna\nbe really clear about is the book takes on both\nright and left cancel culture. They're different in a lot\nof ways and definitely, cancel culture from the left\nis more important in academia where the left dominates. But we talk a lot about cancel culture coming from legislatures. We talk a lot about cancel\nculture on campus as well, because even though most of the attempts that come from on campus\nto get people canceled are still from the left, there are a lot of attacks\nthat come from the right that come from attempts by\ndifferent organizations. And sometimes when there\nare stories in Fox News, like they'll go after professors and about one third of the attempts to get professors punished\nthat are successful actually do come from the right and we talk about attempts\nto get books banned, in the book, we talk about\nsuing the Florida legislature. Ron DeSantis had something\ncalled the Stop-Woke Act, which we told everyone this\nis laughably unconstitutional. They tried to ban particular\ntopics in higher ed and we're like, no, this is a joke. Like this will be laughed out of court. And they didn't listen to\nus and they brought it, they passed it and we sued and we won. Now they're trying again with something that's\nequally as unconstitutional and we will sue again and we will win. - Can you elaborate on Stop-Woke Act? This is presumably trying\nto limit certain topics from being taught in school? - Yeah, basically woke topics. It came out of the sort of attempt to get at critical race theory. So it's topics related to\nrace, gender, et cetera. I don't remember exactly how\nthey tried to cabinet it to CRT but when you actually, the law's really well established that you can't tell higher education what they're allowed to teach without violating the First Amendment. And when this got in front of\na judge, it was exactly as... He was exactly as skeptical\nof it as we thought he'd be. I think he called this dystopian\nand it wasn't a close call. - So if you're against\nthat kind of teaching, the right way to fight\nit is by making the case that it's not a good idea\nas part of the curriculum as opposed to banning\nit from the curriculum. - Yeah. The state doesn't have the\npower to simply say to ban, what professors in higher education teach. Now, it gets a little more complicated when you talk about K through 12 because the state has a role in deciding what public K through 12 teaches because they're your kids. It's taxpayer funded and generally the legislature is involved. There is democratic\noversight of that process. - So for K through 12, is there also a lean towards the left in terms of the administration\nthat manages the curriculum? - Yeah, there definitely\nis in K through 12. I mean, my kids go to public school. I have a five and a seven year old and they have lovely teachers, but we have run into a lot of problems with education schools at FIRE and a lot of the graduates\nof education school end up being the administrators who clamp down on free\nspeech in higher education. And so I've been trying\nto think of positive ways to take on some of this, some of the problems that\nI see in K through 12. I thought that the\nattempt to just dictate, you won't teach the following\n10 books or 20 books or 200 books was the wrong way to do it. Now when it comes to deciding what books are in the curriculum, again that's something a legislature\nactually can have some say in and that's pretty uncontroversial\nin terms of the law. But when it comes to how you fight it, I had something that since I'm kind of stuck with the formula I called \"Empowering of the American Mind\" I gave principles that were inconsistent with the sort of group think and heavy emphasis on identity politics that some of the critics are\nrightfully complaining about in K through 12. And that is actually in\n\"Canceling of the American Mind\" but I have a more\ndetailed explanation of it that I'm gonna be putting up on my blog, the eternally radical idea. - Is it possible it's legally... This is a silly question perhaps. Create an extra protection for certain kinds of\nliterature, 1984 or something to remain in the curriculum. I mean it's already, it's\nall protected, I guess. I guess to protect against administrators from fiddling too much\nwith the curriculum, like stabilizing the curriculum. I don't know what the machinery of the K through 12 public school. - In K through 12, state legislatures... - [Lex] They're part of that. - They're part of that\nand they can say like, you should teach the following books. Now of course people are\nalways a little bit worried that if they were to recommend, teach the Declaration of Independence, that it will end up being, well they're gonna teach the\nDeclaration of Independence was just to protect\nslavery, which it wasn't. - Yeah, so teaching a\nparticular topic matters which textbooks you choose, which perspective you take,\nall that kind of stuff. Of course there's like religion starts to creep into the\nwhole question of like, is the Bible, are you allowed to incorporate\nthat into education? - Yeah, I mean, I'm an atheist with an intense interest in religion. I actually read the entire Bible this year just 'cause I do stuff like that. And I never actually had read it from beginning to end. Then I read the Quran 'cause you know, and I'm gonna try to do the\nBook of Mormon, but, you know. - Well, you're so fascinating. Do you recommend doing that? - I think you should just to know 'cause it's such a touchstone in the way people talk about things. It can get pretty tedious. But I even made myself read through all of the very specific instructions on how tall the different\nparts of the temple need to be and how long the garbs need to be and what shape they need\nto be and what like... And those go on a lot. That surprisingly a big chunk of Exodus, I thought that was more like\nin Leviticus and Deuteronomy, but then you get to\nbooks like Job, you know? Wow. I mean Job is such a read and no way Job originally had that ending. Like Job is basically, it starts out as this perverse\nbet between God and Satan about whether or not they\ncan actually make a good man renounce God, and initially they can't. It's all going very predictably. And then they finally really tortured Job and he turns into the best. Why is God cruel? How\ncould God possibly exist? How could a kind God do these things? And he turns into like the\nbest lawyer in the entire world and he defeats everyone. All the people who come to argue with him, he argues the pants off of them. And then suddenly at the end\nGod shows up and he's like, well, you know, I am everywhere. And it's a very confusing answer. He gets an answer kind of like, I am there when Lionesses give birth and\nI am there, and by the way, there's this giant monster\nLeviathan that's very big and it's very scary and I\nhave to manage the universe and I'm kind of like, God, are you saying that you're very busy? Is that essentially your argument to Job and you don't mention the\nwhole kind of like that I have a bet, that's\nwhy I was torturing you. That doesn't come up. And then at the end he decides, Job's like, oh no, you're totally right. I was totally wrong. Sorry. And God says like, I'm gonna punish those people\nwho tried to argue with you and didn't win. So he gets rid of the... I don't know exactly what he\ndoes to them, I don't remember. And then he gives Job all his money back and he makes him super prosperous. And I'm like, no way that was the original ending of that book because this was like, this was clearly a beloved\nnovel that they were like, but it can't have that ending. - Okay. - So it's a long way of saying I actually think it's worthwhile. Some of it was, you're always kind of surprised\nwhen you end up in the part, like there are parts of it\nthat will sneak up on you, kind of like Isaiah is a trip. Ecclesiastes, Depeche mode. - And you said you also the Quran. - [Greg] Yeah which was fascinating."

      "text": "- So it'd be interesting to ask, is there a tension between\nthe study of religious texts or the following of religion\nand just believing in God and following the various\naspects of religion with freedom of speech. - In the First Amendment, we have something that we\ncall the religion clause. And I've never liked calling it just that because it's two brilliant\nthings right next to each other. The state may not establish\nan official religion, but it cannot interfere with your right to practice your religion. That's beautiful. Two things at the same time. And I think they're both exactly right and I think sometimes the\nright gets very excited of the free exercise clause and the left gets very\nexcited about establishment. And I like the fact that we\nhave both of 'em together. Now, how does this relate\nto freedom of speech and how does it relate to the curriculum like we were talking about? I actually think it would be great if public schools could teach the Bible, like in the sense of like read\nit as a historical document. But back when I was at the ACLU, every time I saw people trying this, it always turned into them\nactually advocating for, a Catholic or a Protestant\nor Orthodox even kind of like read on religion. So if you actually make it\ninto something advocating for a particular view on religion, then it crosses into the\nestablishment clause side. So Americans haven't figured\nout a way to actually teach it. So it's probably better\nthat you learn about it outside of a public school class. - Do you think it's\npossible to teach religion from like world religions kind of force without disrespecting the religions? - I think the answer is it depends on from whose perspective. - Well, like the practitioner say you're like an Orthodox follower\nof a particular religion. - [Greg] Yeah. - Is it possible to not piss you off in teaching like all the\nmajor religions of the world? - For some people, the bottom line is you\nhave to teach it as true. And with that, under those conditions, then the answer is no. You can't teach it without\noffending someone at least. - Can't you say these\npeople believe it's true? Can you reform it? So you have to walk on\neggshells essentially. - You can try really hard and you will still make some people angry, but serious people will be like, oh no, you actually tried to be\nfair to the beliefs here. And I try to be respectful\nas much as I can about a lot of this. I still find myself much\nmore drawn to both Buddhism and stoicism though. - Where do I go? Okay, one interesting thing to\nget back to college campuses"

      "section": "College rankings by freedom of speech",
      "text": "is FIRE keeps the college\nfree speech rankings. - [Greg] Yes. - At rankings.thefire.org. - [Greg] I'm very proud of them. - I highly recommend 'cause forget even just the ranking, you get to learn a lot\nabout the universities from this entirely different perspective than people are used\nto when they go to pick whatever university they want to go to. It just gives another\nperspective on the whole thing and it gives quotes from\npeople that are students there and so on, like about their experiences and it gives different- Maybe you could speak to\nthe various measures here before we talk about who's in the top five and who's in the bottom five. What are the different parameters that contribute to the evaluation? - So people have been\nasking me since day one to do a ranking of schools\naccording to freedom of speech. And even though we had the\nbest database in existence of campus speech codes, policies that universities have\nthat violate First Amendment or First Amendment norms, we\nalso have the best database of, we call the Disinvitation Database, but it's actually it's better named the deplatforming database, which is what we're gonna call it. - And these are all cases\nwhere somebody was invited as a speaker to campus\nand they were disinvited. - Disinvited or deplatforming\nalso includes shouting down. - So they showed up and\nthey couldn't really speak. - Yeah, exactly. And so having that, what we really needed in order to have some\nserious social science to really make a serious argument about what the ranking was,\nwas to be able to, one, get a better sense of how many professors were actually getting\npunished during this time. And then the biggest missing element was to be able to ask students directly what the environment\nwas like on that campus for freedom of speech. Are you comfortable\ndisagreeing with each other? Are you comfortable disagreeing\nwith your professors? Do you think violence is acceptable in response to a speaker? Do you think shouting down is okay? Do you think blocking people's\naccess to a speaker is okay? And once we were able to get\nall those elements together, we first did a test run I\nthink in 2019, about 50. And we've been doing\nit for four years now, always trying to make the\nmethodology more and more precise to better reflect the actual environment at particular schools. And this year the number one school was Michigan Technological University, which was a nice surprise. The number two school was\nactually Auburn University, which was nice to see. In the top 10, the most well-known prestigious\nschool is actually UVA, which did really well this year. University of Chicago was not happy that they weren't number one, but University of Chicago was 13 and they had been number one or in the top three for\nyears prior to that. - Really? So can you explain?\nIt's almost surprising. Is it because of like the really strong\neconomics departments and things like this or what, why? - They had a case involving a student, they wouldn't recognize a\nchapter of Turning Point USA and they made a very classic argument and classic in the bad way that we hear campuses across the country. Oh, we have a campus Republican, so we don't need this\nadditional conservative group. And we're like, no, I'm sorry. Like we've seen dozens and dozens if not hundreds of attempts to get this one particular\nconservative student group derecognized or not recognized. And so we told them like, listen like we told them at FIRE\nthat we consider this serious and they wouldn't recognize the group. So that's a point down in our ranking. And that was enough to knock them from- They probably would've been\nnumber two in the rankings, but now they're 13 out of 248. They're still one of the\nbest schools in the country. I have no problem saying that. The school that did not do\nso well at a negative 10.69, negative 10.69 and we rounded\nup to zero was Harvard. And Harvard has been not\nvery happy with that result. - The only school to\nreceive the abysmal ranking. - [Greg] Yeah, and there\nare a couple of people- - Oh, Harvard. - Oh, Harvard. And there are a couple of people who have actually been really, I think making a mistake by\ngetting very Harvard sounding by being like, I've had\nstatisticians look at this and they think your methodology is a joke and like pointing out and this\ncase wasn't that important. And that scholar wasn't that scholar. Like one of the arguments\nagainst one of the scholars that we counted against them for punishing was that that wasn't a very\nfamous or influential scholar. And I'm kind of like, so your your argument seems to be snobbery like essentially that like you're not understanding our\nmethodology for one thing. And then you're saying that actually that scholar wasn't\nimportant enough to count. And by the way, Harvard,\nby the way, Harvard... - This is the Harvard camera. - Even if we took all of\nyour arguments as true, even if we decided to get\nrid of those two professors, you would still be in negative numbers. You would still be dead last, you would still be after\nGeorgetown and Penn and neither of those schools\nare good for freedom of speech. - I should say, the bottom five is the University of Pennsylvania, like you said, Penn, the\nUniversity of South Carolina, Georgetown University,\nand Fordham University. - All very well earned. They have so many bad cases\nat all of those schools. - What's the best way to find\nyourself in the bottom five if you are a university? What's the fastest way to\nthat negative, to that zero? - A lot of deplatforming. When we looked at the bottom five, 81% of attempts to get\nspeakers deplatformed were successful at the bottom five. There were a couple of\nschools, I think Penn included, where every single attempt, every time a student like objected, a student group objected\nto that speaker coming, they canceled this speech. And I think Georgetown\nwas 100% success rate. I think Penn had 100% success rate. I think Harvard did stand up for a couple, but mostly people got\ndeplatformed there as well."

      "text": "- So how do you push\nback on deplatforming? Well, who would do it?\nIs it other students? Is it faculty? Is it the administration? What's the dynamics of\npushing back, of basically, 'cause I imagine some of it is culture, but I imagine every university\nhas a bunch of students who will protest basically every speaker. And it's a question of how\nyou respond to that protest. - Well, here's the dirty little secret about like the big change in 2014 and FIRE and me and Haidt\nhave been very clear that the big change that we saw on campus was that for most of my career, students were great on freedom of speech. They were the best\nconstituency for free speech, absolutely unambiguously\nuntil about 2013, 2014. And it was only in 2014\nwhere we had these very, kind of sad for us experience where suddenly students were the ones advocating for deplatforming\nand new speech codes kind of in a similar way that\nthey had been doing in say like the mid eighties for example. But here's the dirty little secret. It's not just the students. It's students and administrators. Sometimes only a handful of them though working together to make, to create some of these problems. And this was exactly\nwhat happened at Stanford when Kyle Duncan, a fifth circuit judge tried\nto speak at my alma mater and a fifth of the class\nshowed up to shout him down. It was a real showing\nof what was going on. That 10 minutes into the shout down of a fifth circuit judge, and\nI keep on emphasizing that 'cause I'm a constitutional lawyer, fifth circuit judges are big deals. They're one level below the Supreme Court. About a fifth of the school\nshows up to shout him down. After 10 minutes of shouting him down, an administrator, a DEI\nadministrator gets up with a prepared speech that she's written, that's a seven minute long speech where she talks about free speech, maybe the juice isn't worth the squeeze. And we're at this law school where people could learn\nto challenge these norms. So it's clear that there was coordination amongst some of these administrators. And from talking to students\nthere, they were in meetings, extensive meetings for a long time. They show up, do a shout down, then they take an additional seven minutes to lecture the speaker on free speech. The juice of free speech, not being worth the squeeze. And then for the rest of it, it's just constant\nheckling after she leaves. This is clearly and\nsomething very similar, happened a number of times at Yale where it was very clearly administrators were helping along with a\nlot of these disruptions. So I think every time there is\na shout down at a university, the investigation should\nbe first and foremost, did administrators help\ncreate this problem? Did they do anything to stop it? Because I think a lot of\nwhat's really going on here is the hyper bureaucratization\nof universities with a lot more ideological people who think of their primary job as basically like policing\nspeech more or less. They're encouraging students, sorry, they're encouraging students who have opinions they\nlike to do shout downs and that's why they really\nneed to investigate this. And it is at Stanford, the administrator who gave the prepared remarks about the juice not\nbeing worth the squeeze. She has not been invited back to Stanford, but she's one of the only\nexamples I can think of when these things happen a lot where an administrator\nclearly facilitated something that was a shout down or deplatforming or resulted in a professor getting fired or resulted in a student getting expelled where the administrator\nhas got off scot free or probably in some cases\neven gotten a promotion. - And so a small number of administrators, maybe even a single administrator could participate in the\nencouraging and the organization and thereby empower the whole process. - And that's something I've seen throughout my entire career. And the only thing, it's kind of hard to catch this sort of\nin the act, so to speak. And that's one of the reasons\nwhy it's helpful for people to know about this. There was this amazing case, this was at University of Washington and we actually featured this\nin a documentary made in 2015 that came out in 2015, 2016\ncalled, \"Can We Take A Joke?\" And this was when we started noticing something was changing on campus. We also heard that comedians were saying that they couldn't use\ntheir good humor anymore. This was right around the\ntime that Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock said that they\ndidn't wanna play on campuses 'cause they couldn't be funny. But we featured a case of a comedian who wanted to do a musical called \"The Passion of the Musical\" making fun of \"The Passion of the Christ\" with the stated goal\nof offending everyone, every group equally. It was very much a South Park mission. And it's an unusual case because we actually got\ndocumentation of administrators buying tickets for angry\nstudents and holding an event where they trained them to\njump up in the middle of it and shout \"I'm offended.\" Like, they bought them tickets, they sent them to this thing with the goal of shouting it down. Now, unsurprisingly, when you send an angry group of students to shut down a play, it's\nnot gonna end at just, \"I'm offended.\" And it got heated. There were death threats being thrown. And then the Pullman\nWashington police told Chris, Chris Lee, the guy who made the play, that they wouldn't actually protect him. Now it's not every day you're gonna have that\nkind of hard evidence that actually seeing the\nadministrators be so brazen that they recorded the fact that they bought them\ntickets and sent them. But I think a lot of\nthat stuff is going on. And I think it's a good excuse to cut down on one of the big problems in higher education today, which\nis hyper bureaucratization. - In your experience,\nis there a distinction between administrators and faculty in terms of perpetrators\nof these kinds of things? So if we got rid of all,\nlike Harvey's talked about getting rid of a large\npercentage of the administration, does that help fix the problem? Or is the faculty also... - [Greg] Yeah. - A small percent of the faculty also part of the encouraging\nin the organization of these kind of cancel models? - Yeah. And that's something that has\nbeen profoundly disappointing is that when you look at the huge uptick in attempts to get professors\nfired that we've seen over the last 10 years and\nactually over the last 22 years, as far as far back as our records go. At first they were overwhelmingly\nled by administrators, attempts to get professors punished. And that was most, you know, I'd say that was my career up until 2013 was fighting back at\nadministrative excesses. Then you start having the problem in 2014 of students trying to get people canceled. And that really accelerated in 2017. And the number, so one way, one thing that makes it easier to document are the petitions to get\nprofessors fired or punished and how disproportionately\nthat those actually do come from students. But another big uptick\nhas been fellow professors demanding that their fellow\nprofessors get punished. And that to me- - [Lex] Makes me really sad. - It's kind of shameful. You shouldn't be proud\nof signing the petition to get your fellow professor and what's even more shameful is that this has almost\nbecome a cliche within FIRE when someone is facing one of\nthese cancellation campaigns as a professor. I would get letters from\nsome of my friends saying, \"I am so sorry this has happened to you.\" And these were the same people who publicly signed the\npetition to get them fired. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Integrity. Integrity is an important\nthing in this world. And I think some of it, I'm so surprised people\ndon't stand up more for this 'cause there's so much hunger for it. And if you have the guts as\na faculty or an administrator to really stand up with\neloquence, with rigor, with integrity, I feel like it's impossible\nfor anyone to do anything because there's such a\nhunger, it's so refreshing. - [Greg] Yeah. - I think everybody agrees\nthat freedom of speech is a good thing. - [Greg] Oh, I don't, I don't. - Well, okay, sorry, sorry. - [Greg] I don't agree. - The majority of people\neven at the universities that there's a hunger, but it's almost like this\nkind of nervousness around it because there's a small\nnumber of loud voices that are doing the shouting. So I mean, again, that's where great leadership comes in. And so, presidents of universities should probably be making\nclear declarations of like, this is a place where we value\nthe freedom of expression. - And this was all throughout my career, a president, a university president who\nputs their foot down early and says, \"Nope, we are not entertaining\nfiring this professor. We are not expelling this student.\" It ends the issue often very fast. Although sometimes, and this\nis where you can really tell the administrative involvement,\nstudents will do things like take over the president's office and then that takeover will\nbe catered by the university. People will point this out\nsometimes as being kind of like, oh, it was clearly it,\nlike my friend Sam Abrams, when they tried to get him\nfired at Sarah Lawrence College. And that was one of the\ntimes that it was used as kind of like, oh, this\nwas hostile to the university because the students took\nover the president's office. And I'm like, no, they let them take over\nthe president's office. And I don't know if that\nwas one of the cases in which the takeover was catered, but if there was ever\na sort of like a sign that's kind of like, yes, this is actually\nreally quite friendly. - Well in some sense, like protesting and having\nreally strong opinions, even like ridiculous, crazy,\nwild opinions is a good thing. It's just, it shouldn't\nlead to actual firing or deplatforming of people.\nLike it's good to protest. It's just not good for\nuniversity to support that and take action based on it. - And this is one of those like\ntensions in First Amendment that actually I think has a\npretty easy release essentially. You absolutely have the\nright to devote your life to ending freedom of speech\nand ridiculing it as a concept. And there are people\nwho really can come off as very contemptible\nabout even the philosophy of freedom of speech. And we will defend your right to do that. We will also disagree with you. And if you try to get a professor fired, we'll be on the other side of that. Now I think you had Randy\nKennedy who I really, I love him. I think he's a great guy. But he criticized us for\nour deplatforming database as saying, this is saying that students can't protest speakers. I'm like, okay, that's silly. We FIRE as an organization, have defended the right\nto protest all the time. We are constantly defending\nthe rights to protestors not believing that the protestors have the right to say\nthis would like basically, that would be punishing the speakers. We're not calling for\npunishing the protestors. But what we are saying is you\ncan't let the protestors win if they're demanding someone be fired for their freedom of speech. - So the line there is\nbetween protestors protesting and the university taking\naction based on the protest. - Yeah, exactly. And of course shout downs,\nthat's just mob censorship. And that's something where the university, the way you deal with that\ntension in First Amendment law is essentially kind of\nlike the one positive duty that the government has. The negative duty, the thing that it's not\nallowed to do is censor you. But it's positive duty is that if I want to say awful\nthings or for that matter, great things that aren't\npopular in a public park, you can't let the crowd\njust shout me down. You can't allow what's\ncalled a heckler's veto. - Heckler's veto. That's so interesting 'cause I feel like that comes into play on social media somehow because there's this whole\ndiscussion about censorship and freedom of speech. But to me, the carrot question\nis almost more interesting once the freedom of speech is established is how do you incentivize\nhigh quality debate and disagreement? - I'm thinking a lot about that. And that's one of the things we talk about in \"Canceling of the American Mind\" is arguing towards truth. And that cancel culture\nis cruel, it's merciless, it's anti-intellectual, but it also will never get\nyou anywhere in your truth. And you are going to waste so much time destroying your opponents in something that can actually\nnever get you to truth through the process of course, of you never actually\nget directly at truth, you just chip away at falsity. - Yeah. But everybody having a\nmegaphone on the internet with anonymity, it seems like\nit's better than censorship, but it feels like there's\nincentives on top of that you can construct to\nincentivize better discourse. - [Greg] Yeah. - It's like to incentivize somebody who puts a huge amount of effort to make even the most\nridiculous arguments, but basically ones that don't include any of the things you highlight in terms of all the rhetorical tricks to shut down conversations, just make really good\narguments for whatever, it doesn't matter if it's\ncommunism, for fascism, whatever the heck you want to say. - [Greg] Yeah. - But do it with scale,\nwith historical context, with steelman on the other side, all those kind of elements. - We try to make three\nmajor points in the book. One is just simply cancel culture is real. It's a historic era and\nit's on a historic scale. The second one is you should\nthink of cancel culture as part of a rhetorical, as a larger lazy, rhetorical approach to what we\nrefer to as winning arguments without winning arguments. And we mean that in two senses without having winning arguments or actually having won arguments. And we talk about all the different, what we call rhetorical fortresses, that both the left and the right have that prevent you from... That allow you to just dismiss the person or dodge the argument without actually ever\ngetting to the substance of the argument. Third part is just, how do we fix it. But the rhetorical fortress stuff is actually something\nI'm very passionate about because it interferes with\nour ability to get at truth and it wastes time and\nfrankly it also can, since cancel culture is part\nof that rhetorical tactic, it can also ruin lives."

      "text": "- It would actually be really fun to talk about this particular\naspect of the book. And I highly recommend if\nyou're listening to this go pre-order the book now.\nWhen does it come out? - October 17th. - Okay, \"The Canceling\nof the American Mind.\" Okay, so in the book you also have a list of\ncheap rhetorical tactics that both the left and the right use. And then you have a list of tactics that the left uses and the right uses. So there's the rhetorical, the perfect rhetorical\nfortress that the left uses and the efficient rhetorical\nfortress that the right uses. - Yeah. - First one is whataboutism. - Yeah. - Maybe we can go through a few of them that capture your heart\nin this particular moment as we talk about it. And if you can describe examples of it or if there's aspects\nof it that you see there especially effective. So whataboutism is\ndefending against criticism of your side by bringing\nup the other side's alleged wrongdoing. - I wanna make little cards of these, of all of these tactics and start using them on X all the time because they are so commonly deployed. And whataboutism I put first for a reason. - You know it'd be an interesting idea to actually integrate\nthat into Twitter slash X where people instead of clicking heart, they can click which of the\nrhetorical tactics this is. And then 'cause you know,\nthere's actually community notes. I don't know if you've seen on X there, people can contribute notes\nand it's quite fascinating. It works really, really well. But to give it a little more structure. - Yeah. - That's a really\ninteresting method actually. - Yeah I actually, when I was thinking about\nways that X could be used to argue towards truth,\nI wouldn't wanna have it so that everybody would be bound to that. But I think that, I imagine it almost being\nlike a stream within X that was truth focused, that agrees to some additional rules on how they would argue. - Man, I would love that. Where like there's, in terms of streams that\nintersect and could be separated, the shit talking one where\npeople just enjoy talking shit. - [Greg] Okay, go for it man. - And then there's like\ntruth, and then I mean then there's humor, then\nthere's like good vibes. Like, I'm not like somebody\nwho absolutely needs good vibes all the time, but sometimes- - [Greg] It's nice to have. - It's nice to just log in and not have to see like the drama, the fighting, the bickering,\nthe cancellations, the mobs, all of this. It's good to just see, that's\nwhy I go to Reddit r aww or like one of the cute animals ones where there's cute puppies\nand kittens and it's like. - I just wanna see Ryan Reynolds\nsinging with Will Ferrell. I mean like. - Sometimes that's all you need. - I need that in my heart. - Yeah. Not all the time, just a little bit. And right back to the battle for truth. Okay, so whataboutism. - Whataboutism, yeah, that's everywhere when you look at it,\nwhen you look at Twitter, when you look at social media\nin general, and the first, what we call the obstacle\ncourse is basically time tested, old fashioned, argumentative\ndodges that everybody uses. And whataboutism is just\nbringing up something, like someone makes an\nargument like Biden is corrupt and then someone says,\nwell, Trump was worse. You know, like, and that's\nnot an illegitimate, argument to make back, but it does, it seems to happen every time\nsomeone makes an assertion, someone just points out some\nother thing that was going on and it can get increasingly attenuated from what you're actually trying to argue. And you see this all\nthe time on social media and it's kind of, you know, I was a big fan of John\nStewart's Daily Show, but an awful lot of what the humor was and what the tactic was for arguing was this thing over here. It's like, oh, I'm making this argument about this important problem. Oh actually, there's this\nother problem over here that I'm more concerned about and let's pick on the right here. So January 6th, watching everybody arguing about CHOP, like the occupied part of Seattle or the occupied part of Portland. And basically trying to like, oh, you're bringing up\nthe riot on January 6th. And by the way, I live on\nCapitol Hill, so believe me, I was very aware of like\nhow scary and bad it was. My dad grew up in Yugoslavia\nand that was a night where we all ate dinner in the basement 'cause I'm like, oh,\nwhen this shit goes down, eat in the basement. It was genuinely scary. And people would try to\ndeflect from January 6th being serious by actually\nmaking the argument that, oh, well there are crazy, horrible things happening\nall over the country. Riots that came from some of\nthe social justice protests. And of course the answer is, you can be concerned\nabout both of these things and find them both problems. But if I'm arguing about CHOP, someone bringing up January\n6th isn't super relevant to it. Or if I'm arguing about January 6th, someone bringing up the riots\nin 2020, isn't that helpful."

      "text": "- We took a long dark\njourney from whataboutism. - Yeah. - And related to that is\nstrawmanning and steelmanning. So misrepresenting the perspective of the opposing perspective\nand this is something also I guess is very prevalent and it's difficult to\ndo the reverse of that, which is steelmanning requires empathy, it requires eloquence, it\nrequires understanding, actually doing the\nresearch and understanding the alternative perspective. - My wonderful employee, Angel Eduardo has something\nthat he calls star-manning. And I find myself doing this a lot, it's nice to have two immigrant parents because I remember being in\nSan Francisco in the weird, kind of like ACLU slash\nBirmingham kind of cohort and having a friend\nthere who was an artist who would talk about hating Kansas. And that was his metaphor\nfor middle America is what he meant by it. But he was kind of proud of\nthe fact that he hated Kansas. And I'm like, you gotta understand, I still see all of you a\nlittle bit as foreigners and think about like, change\nthe name of Kansas to Croatia, change the name of Kansas to some- That's what it sounds like to me. And the star-manning idea, which I like, is the idea of being like, so you're saying that you really hate your dominant religious minority. And that's when you start\nactually detaching yourself a little bit from it. How typical, America is\nexceptional in a number of ways. But some of our dynamics\nare incredibly typical. It's one of the reasons why like when people start reading\nThomas Sowell, for example, they start getting hooked. because one of the things he does is he does comparative analysis\nof the country's problems and points out that some of these things that we think are just\nunique to the United States exist in 75% of the rest of\nthe countries in the world. Francis Fukuyama, the book\nthat I'm reading right now, \"The Origins of the Political Order\" actually does this wonderful\njob of pointing out how we're not special\nin a variety of ways. This is actually something\nthat's very much on my mind. And Fukuyama of course, it's a great book. It's stilted a little bit in its writing because his term for one of\nthe things he's concerned about what destroys societies\nis repatrimonialization which is the reversion to societies in which you favor your\nfamily and friends. And I actually think a\nlot of what I'm seeing in the United States, it makes me worried that we might be going through\na little bit of a process of repatrimonialization. And I think that's one of the reasons why people are so angry. I think the prospect\nthat we very nearly seem to have an election that was gonna be, Jeb Bush versus Hillary Clinton. It's like, are we a dynastic country now? Is that what's kind of happening? But also it's one of the reasons why people are getting so\nangry about legacy admissions, about like how much certain families seem to be able to keep their\npeople in the upper classes of the United States perpetually. And believe me, like we\nwere poor when I was a kid and I got to go to one of the fancies. I got to go to Stanford and\nI got to see how people, they treat you differently in\na way that's almost insulting. Like basically, like suddenly to a certain kind of person, I was a legitimate person. And I look at how much\nAmerica relies on Harvard, on Yale to produce its... I'm gonna use a very Marxist\nsounding term, ruling class. And that's one of the reasons why you have to be particularly worried about what goes on at these elite colleges and these elite colleges with the exception\nUniversity of Chicago and UVA do really badly regarding\nfreedom of speech. And that has all sorts of problems. It doesn't bode well for the future of the protection of freedom of speech for the rest of the society. - So can you also empathize\nthere with the folks who voted for Donald Trump? Because as precisely that as a resistance to this kind of momentum\nof the ruling class, this royalty that passes on the rule from generation to generation. - I try really hard to empathize\nwith, to a degree everybody and try to really see\nwhere they're coming from and the anger on the right, I get it. I mean, like, I feel like the book, so \"Coddling the American Mind\" was a book that could be sort of a\ncrowd pleaser to a degree, partially because we\nreally meant what we said in the subtitle that\nthese are good intentions and bad ideas that are hurting people. And if you understand\nit and read the book, you can say it's like, okay, this isn't anybody being malicious, this is people trying\nto protect their kids. They're just doing it in\na way that actually can actually lead to greater\nanxiety, depression, and strangely eventually pose\na threat to freedom of speech. But in this one, we can't be quite. Oh, I haven't even mentioned\nmy brilliant co-author Rikki Schlott, a 23 year old genius. She's amazing. I started working with\nher when she was 20, who's my co-author on this book. So when I'm saying we, I am talking about me and Rikki. - [Lex] She's a libertarian. - [Greg] Libertarian journalist. - [Lex] And a journalist. Yeah, a brilliant mind. - But we can't actually write\nthis in a way that's too kind because cancelers aren't kind. There's a cruelty and a\nmercilessness about it. I mean, I started getting\nreally depressed this past year when I was writing it, and I didn't even want to tell my staff why I was getting so\nanxious and depressed. It's partially because I'm\ntalking about people who will, in some of the cases we're talking about, go to your house, target your kids. So that's a long-winded\nway of saying the... I kind of can get what sort\nof drives the right nuts to a degree in this. I feel like they're\nconstantly feeling like they're being gaslit. Elite education is really\ninsulting to the working class. Like part of the ideology\nthat is dominant right now kind of treats almost 70%\nof the American public, we developed this a little bit in the perfect rhetorical fortress. Like they're to some way illegitimate and not worthy of respect or compassion. - Yeah, the general elitism that radiates self fueling elitism that\nradiates from the people that go to these institutions. - And what's funny is the\nelitism has been repackaged as a kind of... It masquerades as kind\nof infinite compassion that essentially it's based in\na sort of very, to be frank, overly simple ideology and\nover simple explanation of the world and breaking\npeople into groups and judging people on\nhow oppressed they are on the intersection of\ntheir various identities. And it came to that I think initially and it had appeal from\na compassionate core, but it gets used in a way\nthat can be very cruel, very dismissive, compassionless, and allows you to not take seriously most of your fellow human beings."

      "text": "- It's really weird how that happened. Maybe you can explore why a thing that kind of sounds good at first... - [Greg] Yeah. - Can become such a cruel weapon of canceling and hurting\npeople and ignoring people. I mean, this is what you described with a perfect rhetorical fortress which is a set of questions. Maybe you can elaborate on what the perfect\nrhetorical fortress is. - Yeah, so the perfect rhetorical fortress is the way that's been\ndeveloped on the left to not ever get to\nsomeone's actual argument. I wanna make a chart,\nlike a flow chart of this, about like, here's the argument and here\nis this perfect fortress that will deflect you every time from getting to the argument. And I started to notice this certainly when I was in law school, that there were lots of different ways you could dismiss people and\nperfect rhetorical fortress, step one, and I can attest to this because I was guilty of this as well, that you can dismiss people if you can argue that\nthey're conservative. They don't have to be\nconservative to be clear. You just have to say that they are. So I never read Thomas Sowell\nbecause he was a right winger. I didn't read Camille Paglia because someone had convinced\nme she was a right winger. There were lots of authors that, and when I was in law school, among a lot of very bright people, it really was already\nan intellectual habit that if you could designate\nsomething conservative, then you didn't really\nhave to think about it very much anymore or take\nit particularly seriously. That's a childish way of arguing. But nonetheless, I engaged in it. It was a common tactic. I\neven mentioned in the book, there was a time when\na gay activist friend who is I think decidedly to my left, but nonetheless had that\npragmatic experience of actually being an\nactivist, said something like, \"well, just 'cause someone's conservative doesn't mean they're wrong.\" And I remember feeling kind\nof scandalized at some level of just being like, wow,\nisn't that the whole thing what we're saying is that\nthey're just kind of bad people with bad ideas? - You can just throw, oh,\nthat guy's a right winger, you can just throw that. - Boop, don't have to\nthink about you anymore. - Yeah, if you're popular enough, it can be kind of sticky\nand it's weird because- - Because it's effective, that's why it keeps on getting used. Essentially, it should have hit someone because I have a great liberal pedigree, everything from working at\nthe ACLU to doing refugee law in Eastern Europe. I was part of an environmental\nmentoring program for inner city high school kids in DC. I can defend myself as being on the left. But I hate doing that because\nthere's also part of me that's like, \"okay, so what?\" Like, are you really saying that if you can magically make me\nargue or convince yourself that I'm on the right, that you don't have to\nlisten to me anymore? And again, that's arguing like children. And the reason why this\nhas become so popular is because even among, or\nmaybe especially among elites, that it works so effectively as a perfect weapon that\nyou can use uncritically. If I can just prove you're on the right, I don't have to think about you. It's no wonder that suddenly\nyou start seeing people calling the ACLU right wing and calling the New York Times right wing because it's been such an effective way to delegitimize people as thinkers. Stephen Pinker, who's on\nour board of advisors, he refers to academia\nas being the left pole, that essentially it's a position\nfrom that point of view, everything looks to its right. It looks as if it's on the right. But once it becomes a\ntactic that we accept, and that's one of the reasons\nwhy I'm more on the left. But I think I'm left of center liberal. Rikki is more conservative libertarian. And initially I was kind of like, should I be really be writing something with someone who's more on the right? And I'm like, absolutely I should be. I have to actually live up to\nwhat I believe on this stuff because it's ridiculous that\nwe have this primitive idea that you can dismiss\nsomeone as soon as you claim rightly or wrongly that\nthey're on the right. - Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like you were\nrecently called right wing. FIRE, maybe you by association\nbecause of that debate. - Oh, the LA Times. - [Lex] The LA Times. - Oh fun, let's talk about the LA Times. - So yes, there's an\narticle, there's a debate. I can't wait to watch it 'cause I don't think it's\navailable yet to watch on video. You have to attend in person. I can't wait to see it. But FIRE was in part\nsupporting and then LA Times wrote a scathing article about... that everybody in the\ndebate was basically right, leaning right. - Okay, so much to unpack there. Bari Weiss has this great\nproject, the Free Press, I've been very impressed. It's covering stories\nthat a lot of the media right or left isn't willing to cover. And we hosted a debate with her and we wanted to make it as fun and controversial as possible. So FIRE and the, The Free\nPress hosted a debate. \"Did the sexual revolution fail?\" So the debate was really\nexciting, really fun. The side that said that sexual\nrevolution wasn't a failure. That Grimes and Sarah\nHaider were on one won. it it was nice meaty, thoughtful night and there was a review of it\nthat was just sort of scathing about the whole thing. And it included a line saying that FIRE, which claims to believe in free speech, but only defends\nviewpoints it agrees with. I can't believe that even\nmade it into the magazine 'cause it's not just\ncalling us 'cause of course, the implication was that we're\nright wing which we're not. Actually the staff leans\ndecidedly more to the left than to the right. But we also defend people\nall over the spectrum all the time. Like that's something\nthat even the most minimal Google search would've solved. So like we've been giving\nLA Times some heat on this because it's like, yeah, if you said, in my opinion they're right\nwing, we would've argued back, you know, saying, well here's\nthe following 50,000 examples of us not being, but when you actually\nmake the factual claim that we only defend opinions\nwe agree with, first of all, there's no way for us\nto agree with opinions because we actually have a\npolitically diverse staff who won't even agree on\nwhich opinions are good and what opinions we have. But yeah, at one time when\nsomeone did something like this and they were just being\na little bit flippant about kind of like free speech being fine, I did a 70 tweet long thread, just being like, \"Hey, do you\nreally think this is fine?\" I decided not to do that\non this particular one. But the nice thing about it\nis it demonstrated two parts of the book \"Canceling of the\nAmerican Mind\" if not more. One of them is dismissing someone 'cause they're conservative and because that was the implication. Don't have to listen to FIRE\n'cause they're conservative. But the other one is something,\na term that I invented specifically for the way\npeople argue on Twitter, which is hypocrisy projection. Hi, I'm a person who only caress about one\nside of the political fence and I think everyone else is a hypocrite. And by the way, I haven't done\nany actual research on this, but I assume everyone else is a hypocrite. And you see this happen all the time and this happens to FIRE a lot\nwhere someone will be like, where is FIRE on this\ncase? And we're like, we are literally quoted\nin the link you just sent but didn't actually read. Or it's like, where's FIRE on this? It's like, here's our lawsuit\nabout it from six months ago. So it's a favorite thing. And also John Stewart Daily\nShow like the whataboutism, and the kind of like\nidea that these people must be hypocrites is\nsomething that greatest comedy. But as far as actually a rhetorical tactic that will get you the truth, just assuming that your opponent or just accusing your opponent\nof always being a hypocrite is not a good tactic for truth. But by the way, it tends\nto always come from people who aren't actually consistent\non free speech themselves. - So hence the projection. But basically not doing the research about whether the person\nis or isn't a hypocrite and assuming others or a large\nfraction of others reading it will also not do the research. And therefore this kind of statement becomes a kind of truthiness\nwithout a grounding in actual reality.\n- Yeah. - It breaks down that barrier\nbetween what is and isn't true because if the mob says something is true, it takes too much effort to correct it. - And there are three ways\nI wanna respond to this, which is just giving example after example of times where we defended\npeople on both sides of every major issue. Basically every major issue, whether it's Israel Palestine,\nwhether it's terrorism, whether it's gay marriage,\nwe have been, abortion. We have defended both\nsides of that argument. The other part, and I call these the\norphans of the culture war. I really want to urge the media to start caring about free speech cases that actually don't\nhave a political valence that are actually just\nabout good old fashioned exercise of power against\nthe little guy or little girl or little group on campus or\noff campus for that matter 'cause these cases happen, a lot of our litigation\nare just little people, just regular people being\ntold that they can't protest, that they can't hold signs. And then the last part of the argument that I want people to\nreally get is like, yeah, and by the way, right wingers get in trouble too, and there are attacks from the left. And you should take those seriously too. You should care when\nRepublicans get in trouble, you should care when\nCalifornia has a DEI program that requires this,\nCalifornia community colleges has a DEI program, a policy that actually requires\neven chemistry professors to work in different DEI ideas from intersectionality to\nanti-racism into their classroom, into their syllabus, et cetera. This is a gross violation\nof economic freedom. It is as bad as it is to tell\nprofessors what they can't say like we fought and defeated in Florida. It's even worse to tell\nthem what they must say. That's downright totalitarian\nand we're suing against this. And what I'm saying is that,\nwhen you're dismissing someone for just being on the other\nside of the political fence, you are also kind of\nclaiming, making a claim that none of these cases matter as well. And I want people to care about censorship even if it's against people they hate. - Censorship is censorship."

      "text": "If we can take that\ntangent briefly with DEI, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. What is the good and what is\nthe harm of such programs? - DEI, I know people\nwho are DEI consultants. Actually I have a dear\nfriend who I love very much who does DEI, absolutely decent people. What they want to do is create bonds of\nunderstanding, friendship, compassion among people who are different. Unfortunately, the research on what a lot of DEI actually does is oftentimes the opposite of that. And I think that it's partially a problem with some of the ideology that comes from critical race theory, which is a real thing by the way. That informs a lot of DEI, that\nactually makes it something more likely to divide than unite. We talk about this in\n\"Coddling of the American Mind\" as the difference between common\nhumanity identity politics and common enemy identity politics. And I think that, I know some\nof the people that I know who do DEI, they really want it to be common\nhumanity identity politics. But some of the actual\nideological assumptions that are baked in can\nactually cause people to feel more alienated from each other. Now, when I started at FIRE, my first cases involved\n9/11 and it was bad. Professors were getting targeted, professors were losing their jobs for saying insensitive things about 9/11. And both from the right\nand the left actually in that case, actually sometimes\na lot more from the right. And it was really bad. And about five professors lost their jobs. That's bad. Five professors over a\nrelatively short period of time being fired for a political opinion. That's something that would get written up in any previous decades. We're now evaluating\nlike how many professors have been targeted for cancellation between 2014 and middle of\nthis year, July of 2023. We're at about, well over 1,000 attempts to get professors fired or punished, usually driven by students\nand administrators, often driven by professors\nunfortunately as well. About two thirds of those result in the professor\nbeing punished in some way. Everything from having their\narticle removed to suspension, et cetera. About one fifth of those result in professors being fired. So right now, it's almost 200, it's around 190 professors being fired. So I want to give some context here. The Red Scare is generally considered to have been from 1947 to 1957. It ended by the way, in '57\nwhen it finally became clear thanks to the First Amendment, that you couldn't actually fire\npeople for their ideologies. Prior to that, a lot of universities thought they could. This guy is a very\ndoctrinaire or communist, they can't be just persuaded,\nI'm gonna fire them. They thought they actually could do that. And it was only '57 when\nthe law was established. So like right now, these are\nhappening in an environment where freedom of speech, academic freedom are clearly protected at public colleges in the United States and we're still seeing\nthese kind of numbers. During the Red Scare, the biggest study that was\ndone of what was going on I think this came out in like '55 and the evaluation was that\nthere was about 62 professors fired for being communists and\nabout 90 something professors fired for political views overall. That usually is reported\nas being about 100. So 60, 90, 100 depending\non how you look at it, I think the number is actually higher. But that's only because of hindsight. Like what I mean by\nhindsight is we can look back and we actually find\nthere were more professors who were fired as time reveals. We're at 190 professors fired. And I still have to put\nup with people saying this isn't even happening. And I'm like, in the nine and a half years of cancel culture, 190 professors fired. In the 11 years of the Red Scare probably somewhere around\n100, maybe probably more. The number's gonna keep going up. But unlike during the Red Scare where people could clearly\ntell something was happening, the craziest thing about cancel culture is I'm still dealing with\npeople who are saying this isn't happening at all. And it hasn't been subtle on campus. And we know that's a wild\nunder count by the way, because when we surveyed professors, 17% of them said that\nthey had been threatened with investigation or\nactually investigated for what they taught,\nsaid or their research. And one third of them said that they were told by administrators not to take on controversial research. So like extrapolating that out, that's a huge number and the reason why\nyou're not going to hear about a lot of these cases is because there are so\nmany different conformity inducing mechanisms in the whole thing. And that's one of the reasons why the idea that you'd add something like\nrequiring a DEI statement to be hired or to get into a school under the current environment\nis so completely nuts. We have had a genuine\ncrisis of academic freedom over the last, particularly\nsince 2017 on campuses. We have very low viewpoint\ndiversity to begin with. And under these circumstances, administrators just start saying, you know what the problem is, we have too much heterogeneous thought. We're not homogeneous enough. We actually need... We need another political\nlitmus test, which is nuts. And that's what a DEI\nstatement effectively is 'cause there's no way to\nactually fill out a DEI statement without someone evaluating\nyou on your politics. It's crystal clear. We even did an experiment on this. Nate Honeycutt, he got something like\nalmost like 3,000 professors to participate evaluating\ndifferent kinds of DEI statements. And one was basically like the standard kind of identity politics,\nintersectionality one, one was about viewpoint diversity, one was about religious diversity and one was about socioeconomic diversity. And as far as where my heart really is, it's that we have too little\nsocioeconomic diversity, particularly in elite higher ed, but also in education period. So the experiment was, had large participation\nreally interestingly set up and it tried to model the way\na lot of these DEI policies were actually implemented. And one of the ways these\nhave been implemented and I think in some of\nthe California schools is that administrators go\nthrough the DEI statements before anyone else looks at them and then eliminates people off the top depending on how they feel\nabout their DEI statements. And the one on viewpoint diversity, I think like half of the\npeople who reviewed it would eliminate it right out. And I think it was basically the same for religious diversity. It was slightly better, like 40% for socioeconomic diversity. But that kills me. Like the idea that kind of like, yeah, that actually is the kind of\ndiversity that I think we need a great deal more of in higher education. It's not hostile to the\nother kinds by the way, but the idea that we need\nmore people from the bottom, of three quarters of American society, like in higher education, I think should be something\nwe could all get around. That the only one that really succeeded was the one that spouted back exactly the kind of ideology that they thought the readers would like. Which is like, okay, there's no way this couldn't\nbe a political litmus test. We've proved that it's\na political litmus test and still school after school is adding these to its application process to make schools still more\nideologically homogenous. - Why does that have a negative effect? Is it because it enforces\na kind of group think where people are afraid, start becoming afraid to sort\nof think and speak freely, liberally about whatever? - Well one, it selects\nfor people who tend to be, farther to the left in a situation where you already have people, a situation where universities\ndo lean decidedly that way. But it also establishes\nessentially a set of sacred ideas that if you're being quizzed on whether what you've done to advance anti-racism, how you've been conscious\nof intersectionality, it's unlikely that you'd\nactually get in if you said, \"by the way, I actually think\nthese are dubious concepts. I think they're thin. I think they're philosophically\nnot very defensible.\" Basically like if your position was, I actually actually reject these concepts as being over simple. You're not gonna get\nin and I think that... The person that I always think\nof that wasn't a right winger that would be like \"go to hell\" if you made him fill\none of these things out, it's Feynman. I feel like if you gave\none of these things to Richard Feynman, he'd be like, he would tear it to pieces. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And then not get the job. - Yeah, there's some element of it that creates this hard to pin down fear. So you said like the firing, the thing I wanted to say is, firing 100 people or 200 people, the point is even firing one\nperson, I've just seen it, it can create this quiet\nripple effect of fear. - Oh, of course. - That single firing of a faculty- - [Greg] Oh absolutely. - Has a ripple effect across\ntens of thousands of people, of educators, of who is hired, what kind of conversations are being had, what kind of textbooks are chosen, what kind of self censorship\nand different flavors of that is happening. It's hard to measure that. - Yeah I mean, when you\nask professors about, are they intimidated under\nthe current environment, the answer is yes. And particularly conservative professors, already reporting that\nthey're afraid for their jobs in a lot of different cases. - You have a lot of good\nstatistics in the book. Things like self-censorship. One provided with a\ndefinition of self-censorship, at least a quarter of students said they self-censor\nfairly often or very often during conversations with\nother students, with professors and during classroom discussions. 25%, 27% and 28% respectively. A quarter of students also\nsaid that they are more likely to self-censor on campus now\nat the time they were surveyed than they were when they\nfirst started college. So sort of colleges kind of instilling this\nidea of censorship, self-censorship. - [Greg] And back to the\nRed Scare comparison, and this is one of the interesting things about the data as well, is that that same study\nthat I was talking about, the most comprehensive\nstudy of the Red Scare, there was polling about\nwhether or not professors were self-censoring due to\nthe fear of the environment. And 9% of professors said\nthat they were self-censoring their research and what they were saying. 9% is really bad. That's almost a 10th of professors saying that they were actually, their speech was chilled. When we did this question for professors on our\nlatest faculty survey, when you factor together, we asked them are they\nself-censoring in their research, are they self-censoring in class, are they self-censoring online, et cetera. It was 90% of professors. So the idea that we're\nactually in an environment that is historic in terms of\nlike how scared people are actually of expressing\ncontroversial views, I think that it's the reason why we're gonna actually be\nstudying this in 50 years. The same way we studied the Red Scare. The idea that this isn't happening is we'll just be correctly\nviewed as insane."

      "section": "Why colleges lean left",
      "text": "- So maybe we can just\ndiscuss the leaning, the current leaning of\nacademia towards the left which you describe in various\ndifferent perspectives. So one, there's a voter\nregistration ratio chart that you have by department,\nwhich I think is interesting. Can you explain this chart and can you explain what it shows? - [Greg] Yeah, when I\nstarted FIRE in 2001, I didn't take the viewpoint\ndiversity issue as seriously. I thought it was just\nsomething that right wingers complained about. But I really started to get what happens when you have a community\nwith low viewpoint diversity. And actually a lot of the research that I got most interested in was done in conjunction\nwith the great Cuss Sunstein who writes a lot about group polarization and the research on this is very strong, that essentially when you have groups with political diversity, and you can see this actually\nin judges for example, it tends to produce reliably\nmore moderate outcomes. Whereas groups that have\nlow political diversity tend to sort of spiral, spiral off in their own direction. And when you have a\nsuper majority of people from just one political perspective, that's a problem for\nthe production of ideas. It creates a situation where\nthere are sacred ideas. And when you look at\nsome of the departments, I think the estimate from the Crimson is that Harvard has 3% conservatives. But when you look at\ndifferent departments, there are elite departments that have literally no\nconservatives in them. And I think that's an unhealthy\nintellectual environment. The problem is definitely\nworse as you get more elite, we definitely see more\ncases of lefty professors getting canceled at less elite schools. It gets worse as you get\ndown from the elite schools. That's where a lot of\nthe one third of attempts to get professors punished\nthat are successful, do come from the right and largely from off-campus sources. And we spend a lot of\ntime talking about that in the book as well. It's something that I do\nthink is underappreciated, but when it comes to the\nlow viewpoint diversity, it works out kind of like\nyou'd expect to a degree. Economics is what? Four to one or something like that. It's not as bad. But then when you start getting\ninto some of the humanities, like there are departments\nthat there are literally none. - Is there a good why to\nwhy did the universities university faculty\nadministration move to the left? - Yeah. I don't love, and this is an argument that\nyou'll sometimes run into on the left, just the argument that\nwell people on the left are just smarter. And it's like, okay, it's interesting because\nat least the research as of 10 years ago was indicating that if you dig a little\nbit deeper into that, a lot of the people who do\nconsider themselves on the left tend to be a little bit more libertarian. Pinker wrote a fair amount about the idea that we're just smarter. It is not an opinion I'm at\nleast bit comfortable with. I do think that departments\ntake on momentum when they become a place\nwhere you're like, wow, it'd be really unpleasant for\nme to work in this department if I'm the token conservative. And I think that takes\non a life of its own. There are also departments\nwhere a lot of the ideologies kind of explicitly leftist. You look at education schools, a lot of the stuff that\nis actually left over from what is correctly\ncalled critical race theories is present. And you end up having that in\na number of the departments. And it would be very strange\nto be in many departments, a conservative social worker professor. I'm sure they exist, but there's a lot of pressure\nto shut up if you are. - So the process on the\nleft of cancellation, as you started to talk about with the perfect rhetorical fortress, the first step is dismiss a person if you can put a label\nof conservative on them, you can dismiss 'em in that way. What other efficient or what other effective\ndismissal mechanisms are there? - Yeah, we have a little bit\nof fun with demographic numbers and I run this by height and I remember him being kind of like, don't include the actual percentage. I'm like, no, we need to include the actual percentages 'cause people are really bad at estimating what the demographics of\nthe US actually looks like, both the right and the\nleft in different ways. So we put it in the\nnumbers and we talk about, being dismissed for being white or being dismissed for being straight or being dismissed for being male. And you can already dismiss\npeople for being conservative. And so we give examples in the book of these being used to dismiss people and oftentimes on topics not related to the fact that they're a male or whether or not they're a minority. And then we get to, I think it's like layer\nsix and we're like, surprise guess what? You're\ndown to 0.4% of the population and none of it mattered because if you have the wrong opinion, even if you're in that 0.4% of the most intersectional\nperson who ever lived and you have the wrong\nopinion, you're a heretic and you actually probably\nwill be hated even more. And the most interesting part of the research we did for this was just asking every\nprominent black conservative and moderate that we knew personally. Have you been told that\nyou're not really black for an opinion you had? Every single one of\nthem was like, oh yeah. And it's kind of funny\n'cause it's like oftentimes white lefties telling them that's like, oh, do you consider yourself black? John McWhorter talked\nabout having a reporter when he showed that he dissented from some of what he described\nas kind of like woke racism in his book \"Woke Ideas.\" The reporter actually is like, so do you consider yourself black? He's like, what? He was like, what, are you crazy? Of course I do. And Coleman Hughes had one\nof the best quotes on it. He said, \"I'm constantly being told\nthat the most important thing to how legitimate my opinion is, is whether or not I'm black. But then when I have a dissenting opinion, I get told I'm not really black.\" So, perfect. Like, there's no way to\nfalsify this argument. That investigation really struck me. - And you lay this out\nreally nicely in the book, that there is this process of\nsaying, are you conservative? Yes, you can dismiss the person. Are you white? Dismiss the person. Are you male? You can dismiss the person. There's these categories\nthat make it easier for you to dismiss a\nperson's ideas based on that. And like you said, you end\nup in that tiny percentage and you could still dismiss. - And it's not just dismiss. We talk about this from\na practical standpoint, the way the limitations on reality. And one of 'em is time and\na lot of cancel culture as cultural norms, as this\nway of winning arguments without winning arguments is\nabout running up the clock because by the time you\nget down to the bottom or actually even you get a couple of steps into the perfect rhetorical fortress and where has the time gone? You probably just give up trying to actually have the argument and you never get to the\nargument in the first place. - And all of these things are\npretty sticky on social media. - Social media practically invented the perfect rhetorical fortress. - So that each one of those\nstages has a virality to it. - [Greg] Yeah. - So it could stick and then it can get people really excited. - It allows you to feel\noutraged and superiority. - Yeah because of that, at the scale of the virality allows you to never get to the actual\ndiscussion of the point."

It's more efficient. - [Greg] Yeah. - So you don't have to listen to liberals and anyone can be labeled a liberal if they have a wrong opinion. I've seen liberal and\nleft and leftist all used in the same kind of way. That's leftist nonsense. You don't have to listen to experts. Even conservative experts, if\nthey have the wrong opinion, you don't have to listen to journalists, even conservative journalists if they have the wrong opinion. And among the MAGA wing\nthere's a fourth proposition, there's a fourth provision. You don't need to listen to\nanyone who isn't pro-Trump. - Yeah, and we call it efficient because it eliminates a lot of people you probably should listen\nto at least sometimes, like we point out sometimes\nlike how cancel culture can interfere with faith and expertise. So we get kind of being a\nlittle suspicious of experts, but at the same time, if you follow that and\nyou follow it mechanically and I think everybody in the US probably has some older uncle\nwho exercises some of these. It is a really efficient way\nto sort of wall yourself off from the rest of the world and dismiss, at least some people you\nreally should be listening to. - The way you laid it out. It made me realize that we just take up so much of our\nbrain power with these things it's literally time- - We could be solving things. - And you get like, you kind of exhaust yourself\nthrough this process of being outraged based on these labels. And you never get to actually, there's almost not enough time for empathy for like looking at a person thinking, well maybe they're right 'cause you're so busy categorizing them. And it's fascinating. - What's the fun in empathy? And I mean, what's so\ninteresting about this is that so much societal energy seems to be spent on these nasty, primal desires where\nessentially a lot of it's like, please tell me who I'm allowed to hate. Where can I legitimately be cruel? Where can I actually exercise some aggression against somebody? And it seems to sometimes be just finding new justifications for that\nand it's an understandable, human failing that sometimes\ncan be used to defend justice, but again, it will never get\nyou anywhere near the truth. - One interesting case that you cover, about expertise is with COVID. - [Greg] Yeah. - So how did cancel culture come into play on the topic of COVID? - Yeah, I think that COVID was\na big blow to people's faith and expertise and cancel culture\nplayed a big role in that. I think one of the best examples of this is Jennifer Sey at Levi's.\nShe is a lovely woman. She was a vice president at Levi's. She talked about actually potentially to be the president of Levi's jeans. And she was a big advocate for kids. And when they started\nshutting down the schools, she started saying, this\nis going to be a disaster. This is going to hurt the poor and disadvantaged kids the most. We have to figure out a way\nto open the schools back up. And that was such a\nheretical point of view. And the typical kind of\ncancel culture wave took over because we had all sorts of\npetitions for her to be fired and that she needed to apologize\nand all this kind of stuff. And you know, she was offered I think like\na million dollar severance, which she wouldn't take 'cause\nshe wanted to tell the world what she thought about this and that she wanted to continue saying that she hadn't changed her mind. That this was a disaster for young people. And now that's kind of\nthe conventional wisdom and the research is quite clear that this was devastating to particularly disadvantaged youths. Like people understand\nthis now as being okay. She was probably right. But one of the really sad\naspects of cancel culture is people forget why you are canceled and they just know they hate you. There's this lingering kind of like, well I don't have to take\nthem seriously anymore. By the way, did you notice\nthey happened to be right on something very important? Now, one funny thing\nabout freedom of speech, freedom of speech wouldn't exist if you didn't also have the right to say things that were wrong because if you can't engage in ideaphoria, if you can't actually speculate, you'll never actually get\nto something that's right in the first place. But it's especially galling\nwhen people who were right were censored and never\nactually get the credit that they deserve."

However, every time someone mentions CRT, they should also say\nthe very first project of the people who founded CRT, Richard Delgado, Mary Metsuda, et cetera, was to create this new\ncategory of unprotected speech called hate speech. And to get it banned, the person who enabled\nthis drift of course was Herbert Marcuse in 1965 basically questioning\nwhether or not free speech should be a sacred value on the left. And he was on the losing\nside for a really long time. The liberals, the way I\ngrew up that was basically being pro-free speech was\nsynonymous with being a liberal, but that started to be\netched away on campus. And the way it was was with\nthe idea of hate speech that essentially, oh, but we can designate\nparticularly bad speech as not protected and\nwho's gonna enforce it? Who's gonna decide what\nhate speech actually is? Well it's usually\noverwhelmingly can only happen in an environment of really\nlow viewpoint diversity because you have to actually agree on what the most hateful\nand wrong things are. And there's a bedrock principle. it's referred to this in a\ngreat case about flag burning in the First Amendment that I think all the\nworld could benefit from. You can't ban speech just\n'cause it's offensive, it's too subjective. It's one of the reasons\nwhy these kind of codes have been more happily\nadopted in places like Europe where they have a sense that\nthere's like a modal German or a modal Englishman. And I think this is offensive\nand therefore I can say that this is wrong. In a more multicultural, in a\ngenuinely more diverse country that's never actually\nhad an honest thought that there is a single kind of American. There's never been, like we\nhad the idea of Uncle Sam, but that was always kind of a joke. Boston always knew it wasn't,\nRichmond always knew it wasn't Georgia always knew it\nwasn't, you know, Alaska. Like we've always been a hodgepodge and we get in a society that diverse that you can't ban things simply 'cause they're offensive. And that's one of the reasons why hate speech is not an\nunprotected category of speech. And I go further, my\ntheory on freedom of speech is slightly different than most other constitutional lawyers. And I think that's partially\nbecause some of the ways, some of these theories, although a lot of them are\nreally good, are inadequate, they're not expansive enough. And I sometimes call my theory\nthe pure informational theory of freedom of speech or\nsometimes when I wanna be fancy the lab and the looking glass theory. And it's most important tenet is that if the goal is the project\nof human knowledge, which is to know the world as it is, you cannot know the world as it is without knowing what people really think and what people really think is an incredibly important fact to know. So every time you're actually\nsaying \"you can't say that\" you're actually depriving\nyourself of the knowledge of what people really think. You're causing what Timur Kuran who's on our board of advisor, it's called preference falsification. You end up with an inaccurate\npicture of the world. Which by the way, in a lot of cases, because there are activists who want to restrict more speech, they actually tend to think\nthat people are more prejudice than they might be. And actually these kind of restrictions, there was a book called \"Racial Paranoia\" that came out about 15 years ago that was making the\npoint that the imposition of some of these codes\ncan sometimes make people think that the only thing holding you back from being a raging\nracist are these codes. So it must be really, really bad. It can actually make\nall these things worse. And one, which we talk about in the book, one very real practical\nway it makes things worse is when you censor people, it\ndoesn't change their opinion, it just encourages them to\nnot share it with people who will get them in trouble. So it leads them to talk to people who they already agree with and group polarization takes off. So we have some interesting\ndata in the book about how driving people\noff of Twitter, for example, in 2017 and then again I think in 2020, driving people to gab led\nto greater radicalization among those people. It's a very predictable force. Censorship doesn't actually\nchange people's minds and it pushes them in\ndirections that actually by very solid research will actually make them more radicalized. So yeah, I think that the\nattempt to ban hate speech, it doesn't really protect us from it, but it gives the government\nsuch a vast weapon to use against us that we will\nregret giving them. - Is there a ways to sort of, to look at extreme cases to\ntest this idea out a little bit? So if you look on campus, what's your view about allowing say, white supremacists on\ncampus to do speeches? KKK. - I think you should be able\nto study what people think and I think it's important\nthat we actually do. So I think that, let's\ntake for example QAnon. Yeah, QAnon is wrong, but\nwhere did it come from? Why did they think that?\nWhat's the motivation? Who taught them it? Who\ncame up with these ideas? This is important to understand history, it's important to understand\nmodern American politics. And so if you put your scholar hat on, and which you should be\ncurious about kind of everyone, about where they're coming from. Daryl Davis, who I'm sure\nyou're familiar with, part of his goal was just\nsimply to get to know where people were coming from. And in the process he\nactually deradicalized a number of clans members when they actually realized\nthat this black man who would befriended them\nactually was compassionate, was a decent person. They realized all their\npreconceptions were wrong. So it can have a deradicalizing\nfactor by the way, but even when it doesn't, it's still really important to know what the bad people in your society think. Honestly, in some ways\nit's for your own safety, it's probably more important to know what the bad people in your\nsociety actually think. - I personally, I don't know\nwhat you think about that, but I personally think\nthat freedom of speech in cases like that, like KKK on campus can do more harm in the short term, but much more benefit in the long term 'cause you can sometimes argue for like, this is going to hurt in the short term. But I mean, Harvey said this, like consider the alternative.\n- Yeah. - Because you've just kind\nof made the case for like, this potentially would be a good thing even in the short term\nand it often is I think especially in a stable society like ours with a strong middle class,\nall these kinds of things where people have like the comforts to reason through things. But you know, to me it's like, even if it hurts in the short term, even if it does create more\nhate in the short term, the freedom of speech has\nthis really beneficial thing, which is it helps you\nmove towards the truth, the entirety of society towards a deeper, more accurate understanding\nof life on earth, of society, of how people function,\nof ethics, of metaphysics, of everything. And that in the long\nterm is a huge benefit. It gets rid of the Nazis in the long term, even if it adds to the number\nof Nazis in the short term. - Yeah. Well, and meanwhile, just for, and the reality check part of this is people always bring up, what\nabout the Klan on campus? I'm like, they're never invited. I haven't seen a case\nwhere they've been invited. Usually the Klan argument gets thrown out when people are trying to excuse and that's why we\nshouted down Ben Shapiro. And that's why you can't\nhave Bill Maher on campus. And it's like, okay. And it's a little bit of\nthat whataboutism again about being like, well that thing over there is terrible and therefore this\ncomedian shouldn't come. - So I do have a question\nmaybe by way of advice - Sure."

      "text": "- You know, interviewing\nfolks and seeing this, like a podcast has a platform\nin deciding who to talk to or not, that's something I\nhave to come face to face with on occasion. My natural inclination\nbefore I started the podcast was I would talk to anyone and including people which\nI'm still interested in, who are current members of the KKK. And to me there's a responsibility\nto do that with skill. And that responsibility has been weighing\nheavier and heavier on me because you realize how\nmuch skill it actually takes because you have to know,\nto understand so much because I've come to understand that the devil is always\ngoing to be charismatic. The devil's not gonna look like the devil. And so you have to realize, you can't always come to the\ntable with a deep compassion for another human being. You have to have like 90% compassion and another 90% deep historical knowledge about the context of the battles around this particular issue. And that takes just a\nhuge amount of effort. But I don't know if there's\nthoughts you have about this, how to handle speech in\na way without censoring bringing it to the surface, but in a way that creates\nmore love in the world. - I remember Steve Bannon got disinvited from the New Yorker festival\nand Jim Carrey freaked out and all sorts of other people freaked out and they got disinvited and I got invited to speak\non Serash about this. And I was saying like, listen, you don't have people to your conference because you agree with them. Like we have to get out of this idea because they were trying\nto make it sound like that's an endorsement of Steve Bannon. Like that's nonsense. Like if you actually look at the opinions of all the people who are there, you can't possibly\nendorse all the opinions that all these other people\nwho are gonna be there actually have. And in the process of\nmaking that argument, and also of course, the very classic, it's very valuable to know\nwhat Steve Bannon thinks. You should be curious about that and I remember someone\narguing back saying, well, would you want\nsomeone to interview Jihadi? And I'm like, because at the moment, like\nit was at the time when ISIS was really going for it. And I was like, would you not want to go to a talk where someone was trying to figure out what makes some of these people tick? But that changes your framing\nthat essentially it's like no, it's curiosity. is the cure\nfor a lot of this stuff and we need a great deal more curiosity and a lot less unwarranted certainty. - And there's a question of like, how do you conduct such conversations? - [Greg] Sure. - And I feel deeply underqualified. - Who do you think is\nespecially good at that? - I feel like documentary filmmakers usually do a much better job. And the best job is usually\ndone by biographers. So the more time you give\nto a particular conversation like really deep thought\nand historical context and studying the people, how they think, looking at all different perspectives. Looking at the psychology\nof the person, upbringing, their parents, their\ngrandparents, all of this. The more time you spend with that, the better the quality\nof the conversation is because you get to understand, you get to really\nempathize with the person, with the people he or she represents and you get to see the common humanity. All of this. Interviewers often don't do that work. - [Greg] Yeah. - So like the best stuff\nI've seen is interviews that are part of a documentary. But even now, documentaries are like, there's a huge incentive to\ndo as quickly as possible. There's not an incentive\nto really spend time with the person. - There's a great new\ndocumentary about Floyd Abrams that I really recommend. We did a documentary about Ira\nGlasser called \"Mighty Ira\" which was my video team and my protege, Nico Purino and Chris Malby\nand Aaron Reese put it together and it just follows the life\nand times of Ira Glasser, the former head of the ACLU. - If you could just linger on that, that's a fascinating story. - [Greg] Oh, yeah.\n- Who's Ira? - Ira's amazing. Ira, he wasn't a lawyer. He started working at the NYCLU, in the New York Civil\nLiberties Union back in I think the sixties. I think Robert Kennedy recommended that he go in that direction and he became the president\nof the ACLU right at the time that they were suffering\nfrom defending the Nazis at Skokie and Nico and Aaron\nand Chris put together this and they'd never done a documentary before and it came out so, so well, and it tells the story\nof the Nazis in Skokie. It tells the story of the case around it, it tells the story of the ACLU at the time and what a great leader Ira Glasser was. And one of the things that's so great is like when you get to\nsee the Nazis in Skokie, they come off like the idiots\nthat you would expect them to. There's a moment when the\nrally's not going very well and the leader gets flustered and it almost seems like\nhe's gonna like shout out kind of like, \"you're making\nthis Nazi rally into a mockery\" so it showed how actually allowing the Nazis to speak at Skokie kind of took the wind out of their sails. Like the whole movement,\neverybody was kind of, it all kind of dissolved after that because they looked like\nracist fools that they were, even \"Blues Brothers\"\nmade jokes about them. And it didn't turn into the disaster that people thought it was going to be just by letting them speak. And Ira Glassier. Okay, so he has this wonderful story about how Jackie Robinson\njoined the Brooklyn Dodgers and how there was a moment\nwhen it was seeing someone, an African American\nliterally on their team and how that really got 'em excited about the cause of racial equality and that became a big\npart of what his life was. And I just think of that\nas such a great metaphor is expanding your circle and seeing more people as being\nquite literally on your team is the solution to so\nmany of these problems. And I worry that one of the\nthings that is absolutely just a fact of life in America is like we do see each other more as enemy camps as opposed to people on the same team. And that was actually\nsomething in the early days, like me and Will Creeley, the legal director of FIRE\nwrote about the forthcoming free speech challenges of\neveryone being on Facebook. And one thing that I was hoping was that as more people were\nexposing more of their lives, we had realized a lot of these\nthings we knew intellectually like kids go to the bar and\nget drunk and do stupid things. That when we started seeing the evidence of them doing stupid things that we might be shocked at first, but then eventually get more\nsophisticated and be like, well, come on. People are like that. That never actually\nreally seemed to happen. That I don't think, I think that there are plenty of things we know about human nature and we know about dumb things people say, and we've made it into an environment where there's just someone out there waiting to be kind of like, oh, remember that dumb thing\nyou said when we were 14. Well I'm gonna make sure that you don't get into your\ndream school because of that. - That's offense archeology. - [Greg] That's not my term though. - Oh, okay.\n- [Greg] It's a great term. - Well that's a great term.\nWe steal from the best. Digging through someone's past comments to find a speech that hasn't aged well. - And that one's tactical, like that one isn't just\nsomeone not being empathetic. They're like, I'm gonna\npunish you for this and that's one of the\nreasons why I got depressed writing this book because there's already\npeople who don't love me because of \"Coddling of the American Mind\" usually based on a misunderstanding\nof what we actually said in \"Coddling of the American\nMind\" but nonetheless, but on this one, like I'm calling out\npeople for being very cruel in a lot of cases, but one thing that was really scary about studying a lot of these cases is that once you have\nthat target on your back, what they're gonna try to cancel\nyou for could be anything. They might go back into your old books, find something that you said in 1995, do something where essentially it looks like it's this\nentire other thing, but really what's going on is\nthey didn't like your opinion, they didn't like your\npoint of view on something and they're gonna find\na way that from now on anytime your name comes up, it's like, oh, remember this\nthing I didn't like about 'em. And it's, again, it's cruel. It doesn't get you anywhere\ncloser to the truth but it is a little scary\nto stick your neck out. - Okay, in terms of solutions. I'm gonna ask you a few things. So one, parenting. - Yeah, five and seven year old. - So I'm sure you've\nfigured it all out then. - Oh God, no. - From a free speech perspective. - [Greg] Yeah. - From a free speech culture perspective, how to be a good parent. - Yeah. I think the first quality\nyou should be cultivating in your children if you want\nto have a free speech culture is curiosity and an\nawareness of the vastness that will always be unknown. And getting my kids excited\nabout the idea that's like, we're gonna spend our whole\nlives learning about stuff and it's fast and exciting and endless"

      "text": "and we'll never make a big dent in it, but the journey will be amazing, but only fools think they know everything. And sometimes dangerous fools at that. So giving the sense of\nintellectual humility early on being also, saying things\nthat actually do sound kind of old fashioned. I\nsay things to my kids like, \"listen, if you enjoy study and work, both things that I very\nmuch enjoy, I do for fun, your life is going to feel great and it's going to feel easy.\" So some of those old fashioned virtues are things I try to preach. Counterintuitive stuff\nlike outdoor time playing, having time that are not\nintermediated experiences is really important. And little things. Like I talk about in the book about when my kids are\nwatching something that's scary and I'm not talking\nabout like zombie movies, I'm talking about like a cartoon that has kind of a scary moment and saying that they\nwant to turn the TV off. And I talk to them and I say, \"listen, I'm gonna sit next to you and\nwe're gonna finish this show and I want you to tell me what you think of this afterwards.\" And I sat next to my sons\nand by the end of it, every single time when I asked them, \"was that as scary as you\nthought it was gonna be?\" And they was like, \"no\ndaddy, that was fine.\" And I'm like, \"that's one of\nthe great lessons in life. The fear that you don't go through becomes much bigger in your head than actually simply facing it.\" That's one of the reason\nwhy I'm fighting back against this culture. I'd love for all of our\nkids to be able to grow up in an environment where\npeople give you grace and accept the fact that sometimes people are gonna say\nthings that piss you off. Take seriously the\npossibility they may be wrong and be curious. - Well I have hope that\nthe thing you mentioned, which is because so much\nof young people's stuff is on the internet that they're going to\ngive each other a break 'cause then everybody's cancel worthy. - Generation Z hates\ncancel culture the most. And that's another reason\nwhy it's like people still claiming this is even happening. It's kind of like, no,\nyou actually can ask, kids what they think of cancel\nculture and they hate it. - Yeah. Well I kind of think of them\nas like the immune system that's like, that's the\nculture waking up to like, no, this is not a good thing. - I am glad though. I mean, I'm one of those kids who, is really glad that I was a\nlittle kid in the eighties and a teenager in the nineties because having everything\npotentially online, it's not an upbringing I envy. - Well because you can also\ndo the absolutest free speech. I like leaning into it where I hope for a future where a lot of our insecurities, flaws, everything's out there. And to be raw, honest with it, I think that leads to a better world 'cause the flaws are beautiful. I mean, the flaws is the basic ingredients of human connection. - Robert Wright, he\nwrote a book on Buddhism and I talked about trying\nto use social media from a Buddhist perspective\nand like as if you're- As if it's the collective\nunconscious meditating and seeing those little like angry bits that are trying to cancel\nyou or get you to shut up. And just kind of like\nletting them go the same way you're supposed to watch your\nthoughts kind of trail off. - I would love to see\nthat, like visualized, whatever the drama going on, just seeing the sea of it, of the collective consciousness\njust processing this and having a little like panic attack and just kind of like breathing it in. - Looking at the little\nsort of hateful angry voices kind of pop up and be\nlike, okay, there you are. And I'm still focused on that thing because that is one of\nthe things is okay, yeah, actually this is probably late in the game to be giving my grand\ntheory on this stuff. (Lex laughs) - Never too late. - So what I was studying in law school, when I ran out of First Amendment classes, I decided to study censorship\nduring the Tudor Dynasty because that's where we get\nour ideas of prior restraint that come from the licensing\nof the printing press, which was something that Henry\nVIII was the first to do. Where basically the idea was that if you can't print\nanything in England, unless it's with these, your\nMajesty approved printers, it will prevent heretical work and anti-Henry VIII stuff from coming out. Pretty, pretty, pretty,\npretty, pretty efficient idea if nothing else. And I always, so he started getting angry at the printing press around 1521 and then passed something\nthat required prints to be along with parliament in 1538. And I always think of that as\nkind of like where we are now because back then we had the\noriginal disruptive technology, writing was probably that. But the next one, which\nwas the printing press, which was absolutely calamitous. And I say calamitous on purpose\nbecause in the short term the witch hunts went up like crazy because the printing press\nallowed you to get that manual on how to find witches that\nthe religious wars went crazy. It led to all sorts of\ndistress, misinformation, nastiness. And Henry VIII was trying\nto put the genie back in the bottle. You know, he was kind of like, I want to use this for good. Like I feel like it could be used, but he was in an unavoidable\nperiod of epistemic anarchy. There's nothing you can do to make the period after\nthe printing press came out to be a non-disruptive, non-crazy period other than like absolute totalitarianism and destroy all the print presses, which simply was not possible in Europe. So I feel like that's kind\nof like where we are now. That disruption came from adding, I think several million people\nto the European conversation and then eventually the\nglobal conversation. But eventually it became the\nbest tool for disconfirmation for getting rid of falsity,\nfor spotting bad ideas. And it's the benefits, the long-term benefits\nof the printing press are incalculably great. And that's what gives me some\noptimism for where we are now with social media 'cause we are in that\nunavoidably anarchical period. And I do worry that there are attempts\nin states to pass things to try to put the genie\nback in the bottle. Like if we ban TikTok or\nwe say that nobody under 18 can be on the internet unless\nthey have parental permission. We're going at something that\nno amount of sort of top-down is going to be able to fix it. We have to culturally\nadapt to the fact of it in ways that make us wiser that actually and allow it potentially\nto be that wonderful engine for disconfirmation that we're\nnowhere near yet, by the way. But think about it, additional\nmillions of eyes on problems, thanks to the printing press helped create the scientific\nrevolution, the enlightenment, the discovery, ignorance. We now have added billions\nof eyes and voices to solving problems and we're using them for\ncat videos and canceling. - But those are just the early\ndays of the printing press. - Exactly. - It all starts with the\ncats and the canceling. Is there something about X, about Twitter, which is perhaps the most\nenergetic source of cats and canceling. - It seems like the collective\nunconscious of the species. I mean like, it's one of these things\nwhere the tendency to want to see patterns in history sometimes can limit the actual\nbatshit crazy experience of what history actually is because yes, we have these\nnice comforting ideas that it's gonna be like last time, we don't know, it hasn't happened yet. And I think how unusual Twitter is because I think of it as like the... Because people talk about\nwriting and mass communications and as being expanding the\nsize of our collective brain, but now we're kind of looking\nat our collective brain in real time and it's filled\njust like our own brains with all sorts of like little\ncrazy things that pop up and appear like virtual particles\nkind of all over the place of people reacting in real time to things. There's never been anything\neven vaguely like it. And it can be at its worst, awful to see. At its best sometimes seeing people like just getting euphoric\nover something going on and cracking absolutely\nbrilliant immediate jokes. At the same time, it can\neven be a joyful experience. I feel like, and I live in a neighborhood now on X where I mostly deal\nwith people that I think are actually thoughtful,\neven if I disagree with 'em and it's not such a bad experience. I occasionally run into\nthose other sort of what I call neighborhoods on X, where it's just all\ncanceling, all nastiness and it's always kind of an\nunpleasant visit to those places. I'm not saying the whole thing needs to be like my experience, but I do think that the reason why people keep on coming back to it is it reveals raw aspects of humanity that sometimes we prefer\nto pretend don't exist. - Yeah but also, it's\ntotally new, like you said. It's just the virality, the\nspeed, the news travels, the opinions travel that the\nbattle over ideas travels. - The battle over information too. - Yeah, of what is true\nand not, lies travel. The old Mark Twain thing\npretty fast on the thing. And then it changes your understanding of how to interpret information. - It can also stress you out to no end. Remember to get off it sometimes. The stats are pretty bad on\nmental health with young people. And I'm definitely in the\ncamp of people who think that social media is part of that. I understand the debate, but I'm pretty persuaded\nthat one of the things that it hasn't been\ngreat for mental health, I mean of people is just\nconstantly being exposed. - Yeah, absolutely. I think it's possible\nto create social media that makes a huge amount of\nmoney, makes people happy. To me, like it's possible\nto align the incentives. So in terms of, yeah, making teenagers, making every stage of life, giving you long-term\nfulfillment and happiness with your physical existence\noutside of social media and on social media. Helping you grow as a human being, helping challenge you\njust in the right amount and just the right amount of cat videos, whatever gives this full\nrich human experience. I think it's just a\nmachine learning problem. It's like, it's not easy... - [Greg] Interesting. - To create a feed. So the easiest feed you could do is like maximize engagement. - [Greg] Yeah. - But that's just like\na really dumb algorithm. It's like for the algorithm\nto learn enough about you to understand what will\nmake you truly happy as a human being to grow long term, that's just a very\ndifficult problem to solve. - Have you ever watched \"Fleabag?\" It's absolutely brilliant. A British show and it sets you up. One of the reasons why\nlike people love it so much is it sets you up that you're\nwatching like a raunchy British \"Sex in the City\"\nexcept the main character is the most promiscuous one. And it's like okay. And you kind of roll\nyour eyes a little bit and it's kind of funny\nand it's kind of cute and kind of spicy. And then you realize that the person is actually kind of suffering\nand having a hard time and it gets deeper and\ndeeper as the show goes on. And she will do these incredible speeches about tell me what to do. Like I know there's experts out there, I know there's knowledge out there. I know there's an optimal\nway to live my life, so why can't someone\njust tell me what to do? And it's this wonderfully like, accurate I think aspect of human desire that what if something\ncould actually tell me the optimal way to go 'cause I think there is a desire to give up some amount of your\nown freedom and discretion in order to be told to do\nthe optimally right thing. But that path scares me to death. - Yeah, but see the way you phrased it, that scares me too. So there's several things. One, you could be constantly\ndistracted in a TikTok way by things that keep you engaged. So removing that and giving you a bunch\nof options constantly and learning from long-term what results in your\nactual long-term happiness. So like which amounts of\nchallenging ideas are good for you. For somebody like me.\n- Four. Just four. - But there is a number\nlike that for you, Greg. For me, that number is pretty high. I love debate. I love the feeling of like realizing, holy shit, I've been wrong. - Yes! - But like, I would love for the algorithm to know that about me and to help me, but always giving me options if I want to descend into\nCat videos and so on. - But the educational aspect of it. - [Lex] Yes, educational, yes. - Like the idea of kind of\nlike both going the speed that you need to and\nrunning as fast as you can. - Yeah. I mean there's the whole flow thing. I just feel YouTube\nrecommendation for better or worse if used correctly, it feels like it does a pretty good job whenever I just refuse to click on stuff that's just dopamine based and click on only educational things, the recommendation it\nprovides are really damn good. So I feel like it's a solvable problem, at least in the space of\neducation, of challenging yourself but also expanding your realm of knowledge and all this kind of stuff. - And I'm definitely more in the, we're in an inescapably anarchical period and require big cultural adjustments and there's no way that this isn't gonna be\na difficult transition. - Is there any specific\nlittle or big things that you'd like to see X do, Twitter do? - I have lots of thoughts on that. With the printing press,\nan extra millions of eyes on any problem can tear\ndown any institution, any person or any idea and\nthat's good in some ways 'cause a lot of medieval\ninstitutions needed to be torn down and some people did too. And a lot of ideas needed to be torn down. Same thing is true now. An extra billions of eyes on every problem can tear down any person,\nidea or institution. And some, again, some of those things\nneeded to be torn down, but it can't build yet. We are not at the stage\nthat can build yet. But it has shown us how\nthin our knowledge was. It's one of the reasons\nwhy we're also aware of the replication crisis. It's one of the reasons\nwhy we're also aware of how kind of shoddy our research is. How much our expert class\nis arrogant in many cases. But people don't wanna live in a world where they don't have\npeople that they respect and they can look at. And I think what's happening possibly now, but will continue to happen is people are gonna establish themselves as being high integrity. That they will always be honest. I think you are establishing yourself as someone who is high integrity, where they can trust that person. FIRE wants to be the institution\nthat people can come to. It's like if it's free speech,\nwe will defend it, period. And I think that people\nneed to have authorities that they can actually trust. And I think that if you\nactually had a stream that maybe people can watch in action but not flood with stupid\ncancel culture stuff or dumb cat memes, where it is actually a serious discussion, bounded around rules. No perfect rhetorical fortress, no efficient rhetorical fortress, none of the the BS ways we debate. I think you could start to\nactually create something that could actually be a major improvement in the speed with which we\ncome up with new better ideas and establish and separate\ntruth from falsity. - Yeah, if it's done well, it can inspire a large number of people to become higher and higher integrity and it can create integrity\nas a value to strive for. - [Greg] Yeah. - And like, there's been\nprojects throughout the internet that have done incredible job of that, but have been also very flawed. Like Wikipedia is an example\nof a big leap forward in doing that. - [Greg] It's pretty damn impressive. What's your overall take? I mean, I'm mostly impressed. - So there's a few really powerful ideas for the people who edit Wikipedia. One of which is each editor\nkind of for themselves declares, I'm into politics and I really kind of\nam a left-leaning guy, so I really shouldn't be\nediting political articles 'cause I have bias. - [Greg] Oh, that's great. - They declare their biases\nand they often do a good job of actually declaring the\nbiases, but they'll still, like, they'll find a way to justify themselves. Like something will piss them off and they want to correct it 'cause they love correcting\nuntruth into truth, but the perspective of what is true or not is affected by their bias. - [Greg] Truth is hard to know. - And it is true that there\nis a left-leaning bias on the editors of Wikipedia. So for that, what happens is on articles,\nwhich I mostly appreciate that don't have a\npolitical aspect to them, scientific articles or technical articles, they can be really strong, even history just describing\nthe facts of history that don't have a subjective element. Strong. Also just using my own brain, I can kind of filter out if it's something about January\n6th or something like this, I know I'm going to be like, I'm not, whatever's going on here,\nI'm gonna kind of read it. But most I'm gonna look to other sources. I'm gonna look to a bunch of\ndifferent perspectives on it. It's going to be very tense. There's probably going\nto be some kind of bias, maybe some wording will be such, which is where Wikipedia does its thing. The way they word stuff will\nbe biased, the choice of words. But the Wikipedia editors\nthemselves are so self-reflective. They literally have articles\ndescribing these very effects of how you can use words to inject bias in all the ways that you talk about it. - [Greg] That's healthier\nthan most environments. - It's incredibly healthy, but\nI think you could do better. One of the big flaws of Wikipedia to me that community notes on X does better is the accessibility\nof becoming an editor. It's difficult to become an editor and it's not as visible\nthe process of editing. So I would love, like you said, a stream for everyone to be able\nto observe this debate between people with integrity of when they discuss\nthings like January 6th, of very controversial topics to just see how the\nprocess of the debate goes as opposed to being hidden in the shadows, which it currently is in Wikipedia. You can access that. It's just hard to access and I've also seen how they\nwill use certain articles like on certain people, like articles about people\nI've learned to trust less and less because they\nliterally will use those to make personal attacks. And this is something you write about, they'll use descriptions\nof different controversies to paint a picture of a person that doesn't, to me at least, feel like an accurate\nrepresentation of the person. And it's like writing an\narticle about Einstein, mentioning something\nabout theory of relativity and then saying that he\nwas a womanizer and abuser and like controversy, you know? Yeah, he is fine man also, you know, they're not exactly the perfect\nhuman in terms of women, but like there's other\naspects to this human and to capture that human properly, there's a certain way to do it. I think Wikipedia will often lean, they really try to be\nself-reflective and try to stop this, but they will lean into the\ndrama if it matches the bias. But again, much better than the world, I believe is much better\nbecause Wikipedia exists. But now that we're in\nthese adolescent stages, we're growing and trying to come up with different technologies,\nthe idea of a stream is really, really interesting because you get more and more\npeople into this discourse that where the value is\nlet's try to get the truth. - Yeah. And that basically, you know, you get little cards for\nnope wrong, nope wrong. - And the different rhetorical techniques that are being used to\navoid actually discussing. - Yeah. And I think I actually can\nmake it a little bit fun by getting a limited number of them. You know, it's kind of like you\nget three whataboutism cards - So gamifying the whole thing? Absolutely. - [Greg] Yeah. - Let me ask you about,"

      "section": "Depression",
      "text": "so you mentioned going\ninto some difficult moments in your life.\n- [Greg] Sure. - What has been your\nexperience with depression? What has been your\nexperience getting out of it, overcoming it? - Yeah, I mean the whole\nthing, the whole journey, with \"Coddling of the\nAmerican Mind\" began with me at the Belmont Psychiatric\nfacility in Philadelphia back in 2007. I had called 911 in a moment of clarity because I'd gone to the hardware store to make sure that when I\nkilled myself, that it stuck. I wanted to make sure\nthat I had my head wrapped and everything. So like, if all the drugs I was\nplanning to take didn't work that I wouldn't be able\nto claw my way out. It'd been a really rough year. And I always had issues with depression, but they were getting worse. And frankly, one of the reasons why\nthis cancel culture stuff is so important to me is that the thing that I\ndidn't emphasize as much in \"Coddling of the American\nMind\" which by the way, that description that I give\nof trying to kill myself was the first time I'd\never written it down. Nobody in my family was\naware of it being like that. My wife had never seen it. And basically the only way\nI was able to write that was by doing, you know how you\ncan kind of trick yourself? And I was like, I'm\ngoing to convince myself that this is just between\nme and my computer and nobody will see it. And it's probably now\nthe most public thing I've ever written. But what I didn't emphasize in that was how much the culture war played into how depressed I got because I was originally\nthe legal director of FIRE, then I became president of FIRE in 2005, moved to Philadelphia\nwhere I get depressed and, I don't have family there. There's something about the town. They don't seem to like me very much. But the main thing was\nbeing in the culture world all the time. There was a girl that I\nwas dating, I remember, she didn't seem to really\napprove of what I did. And a lot of people didn't\nreally seem to, and meanwhile, like I was defending people\non the left all the time, and they'd be like, oh, that's good that you're\ndefending someone on the left. But they still would never forgive me for defending someone on the right and I remember saying\nat one point, I'm like, listen, I'm a true believer in this stuff. I'm willing to defend Nazis. I'm certainly willing\nto defend Republicans. And she actually said, I think\nRepublicans might be worse. And that relationship didn't go very well. And then I've nearly gotten\nfistfights a couple of times with people on the right because they found out I\ndefended people who crack jokes about 9/11. Like, this happened more than once. And by that time I'm in my twenties, I'm not fist fighting again. But yeah, it was always like that. You see how hypocritical people can be, you can see how friends can turn on you if they don't like your politics. So I got a early preview of this, of what the culture we were heading into by being the president of\nFIRE and it was exhausting. And that was one of the main\nthings that led me to be, suicidally depressed. At the Belmont Center, if you told me that that\nwould be the beginning of a new and better life for me, I would've laughed if I could have. You can tell I'm okay\nif I'm still laughing. And I wasn't laughing at that point. So I got a doctor and I started doing\ncognitive behavioral therapy. I started having all\nthese voices in my head that were catastrophizing and it gave overgeneralization\nand fortune telling, mind reading, all of these things that they teach you not to do. And what you do in CBT is essentially something makes you upset\nand then you just write down what the thought was and something minor could\nhappen and your response was, \"well the date didn't seem to go very well and that's because I'm\nbroken and will die alone.\" And you're like, okay, okay, okay. What are the following? That's catastrophizing. That's mind reading,\nthat's fortune telling. That's all this stuff. And you have to do this\nseveral times a day forever. I actually need to brush\nup on it at the moment. And it slowly over time, voices in my head that\nhave been saying horrible, horrible internal talk, it just didn't sound as convincing anymore which was really a kind\nof like subtle effect. Like it was just kind of like, oh wait, I don't buy that I'm broken. Like, that doesn't sound true. That doesn't sound like truth from God like it used to. And nine months after I was\nplanning to kill myself, I was probably happier\nthan I'd been in a decade. And that was one of the things that the CBT is what led me to notice this in my own work, that\nit felt like administrators were kind of selling\ncognitive distortions, but students weren't buying yet. And then when I started noticing\nthat they seemed to come in actually already believing\nin a lot of this stuff, that it would be very dangerous. And that led to \"Coddling\nof the American Mind\" and all that stuff. But the thing that was rough about writing \"The Canceling\nof the American Mind\" and I've mentioned this\nalready a couple of times. I got really depressed this past year because I was studying. There's a friend in\nthere that I talked about who killed himself after being canceled. I talked to him a week\nbefore he killed himself. And I hadn't actually checked in with him because he seemed so confident. I thought he would be totally fine 'cause he had an insensitive\ntweet in June of 2020 and got forced out in a way that didn't actually sound as bad as a lot of the other professors. He actually at least\ngot a severance package. But they knew he'd sue and\nwin 'cause he had before. And so I waited to check in on him 'cause we were so overwhelmed\nwith the request for help and he was saying people were\ncoming to his house still. And then he shot himself the next week. And because everyone knows I'm so public about my struggles with this stuff, everybody who fights\nthis stuff comes to me when they're having a hard time. And this is a very hard\npsychologically taxing business to be in, and even\nadmitting this right now, like I think about like\nall the vultures out there, they'll have fun with it. Just like the same way when my friend Mike Adams killed himself, there were people like\ncelebrating on Twitter that a man was dead because\nthey didn't like his tweets. But somehow that made them compassionate for some abstract other person. So I was getting a little\ndepressed and anxious. And the thing that really helped\nme more than anything else was confessing to my staff... Books take a lot of energy so I knew they didn't want to hear that. Not only was this taking\na lot of the boss's time, this was making him depressed and anxious. But when I finally told\nthe leadership of my staff, people that even though I try to maintain a lot of distance from,\nI love very, very much, it made such a difference, because I could be open about that. And the other thing was, have you heard there's\nconference dialogue? - Oh yes. - It's like an invite only thing. It's Orrin Hoffman runs it, it intentionally tries to get people over the political\nspectrum to come together and have off the record\nconversations about big issues. And it was nice to be in a room\nwhere liberal, conservative, none of the above were all like, oh, thank God someone's\ntaking on cancel culture. And where it felt like, it felt like maybe this\nwon't be the disaster for me and my family hat I was\nstarting to be afraid of. It would be that taking the stand might actually have a happy ending. - One thing that just stands out from that is the pain of cancellation\ncan be really intense. And that doesn't necessarily\nmean losing your job, but just even you can call it bullying, you can call it whatever name, but just some number of\npeople on the internet. And that number can be small kind of saying bad things to you, that can be a pretty powerful\nforce to the human psyche, which was very surprising. And then the flip side also of that, it really makes me sad\nhow cruel people can be. - Yeah, thinking that your\ncause is social justice in many cases can lead people to think, I can be as cruel as I\nwant in pursuit of this when a lot of times, it's just a way to sort\nof vent some aggression, on a person that you think\nof only as an abstraction. - So I think it's important\nfor people to realize that like whatever negative energy, whatever negativity you\nwant to put out there. Like there's real people\nthat can get hurt. Like you can really get people to one, be the worst version of themselves or to possibly take their own\nlife and it's not as real. - Yeah, well that's one of the\nthings that we do in the book to really kind of address\npeople who still try to claim this isn't real, is we just\nquote, we quote the Pope, we quote Obama, we quote James Carville, we quote Taylor Swift on cancel culture. And Taylor Swift's quote is essentially about like\nhow behind all of this, when it gets particularly nasty, there's this very clear, kill yourself kind of\nundercurrent to it and it's cruel. And the problem is that in\nan environment so wide open, there's always going to be someone who wants to be so transgressive\nand say the most hurtful, terrible thing. But then you have to remember\nthe misrepresentation, getting back to the old idioms. Sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me, has been re-imagined in campus debates in the most asinine way. People will literally say stuff like, but now we know words can hurt. And it's like, now we know words can hurt? Guys, you didn't have to come\nup with a special little thing that you teach children\nto make words hurt less if they never hurt in the first place. It wouldn't even make sense the saying, it's a saying that you repeat to yourself to give yourself strength when the bullies have noticed\nyou're a little weird. This might be a little personal. And it helps, it really does\nhelp to be like, \"listen, okay, assholes are\ngonna say asshole things and I can't let them have\nthat kind of power over me.\" - Yeah, it still is a learning experience 'cause it does hurt. - But for the good people\nout there who actually, just sometimes think that they're venting, you know, think about it. Remember that there are people\non the other side of it. - Yeah, for me it hurts my\nkind of faith in humanity. I know it shouldn't, but it does sometimes when I just see people\nbeing cruel to each other, it kind of, it floats a\ncloud over my perspective of the world that I wish\ndidn't have to be there. - Yeah, that was always\nmy sort of flippant. But the answer to that, if mankind is basically\ngood or basically evil being like the biggest debate\nin philosophy and being like, well the problem first is there's nothing basic about humanity."

      "text": "- Yeah, what gives you hope\nabout this whole thing, about this dark state that\nwe're in as you describe, how can we get out? What gives you hope that we will get out? - I think that people are sick of it. I think people are sick of not\nbeing able to be authentic. And that's really what censorship is. It's basically telling\nyou don't be yourself. Don't actually say what you think. Don't show your personality,\ndon't dissent, don't be weird, don't be wrong. And that's not sustainable. I think that people have\nkind of had enough of it, but one thing I definitely\nwanna say to your audience is it can't just be up to us\narguers to try to fix this. And I think that, and this may sound like\nit's an unrelated problem, I think if there were highly respected, let's say extremely\ndifficult ways to prove that you're extremely\nsmart and hardworking, that cost little or nothing that actually can give the Harvards and the Yales of the world\na run for their money, I think think that might\nbe the most positive thing we could do to deal with a\nlot of these problems and why. I think the fact that we\nhave become a weird America with a great anti-elitist tradition has become weirdly elitist in\nthe respect that we not only, again are our leadership coming from these few fancy schools, we actually have like\ngreat admiration for them. We kind of look up to them. But I think we'd have a\nlot healthier of a society if people could prove their excellence in ways that are coming from\ncompletely different streams and that are highly respected. I sometimes talk about\nthere should be a test that anyone who passes it gets like a BA in the\nhumanities, like a super BA. Something like someone not a GED, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about something that like, one out of only a couple,\nlike 100 people can pass. Some other way of actually of not going through\nthese massive, bloated, expensive institutions that\npeople can raise their hands and say, \"I'm smart and hardworking.\" I think that could be an\nincredibly healthy way. I think we need additional\nstreams for creative people to be solving problems,\nwhether that's on X or someplace else. I think that there's lots of\nthings that technology could do to really help with this. I think some of the stuff\nthat Sal Khan is working on at Khan Academy could really help. So I think there's a lot of ways, but they exist largely around coming up with new ways of doing things. Not just expecting the\nold things that have say $40 billion in the bank that they're going to reform themselves. And I've been picking on Harvard a lot, but I'm gonna pick on\n'em a little bit more. And I talk a lot about class again. And there's a great book called\n\"Poison Ivy\" by Evan Mandery which I recommend to everybody. It's outrageous, it sounds like me in a rant at Stanford, and I think the stat is,\nelite higher education has more kids from the top 1% than they have from the bottom 50 or 60% depending on the school. And when you look at how much they actually like\nreplicate class privilege, it's really distressing. So everybody should read \"Poison Ivy.\" - And above all else, if you're\nweird, continue being weird. - [Greg] Yeah, please. - And you're one of the most interesting, one of the weirdest in\nthe most beautiful way people I've ever met, Greg. Thank you for the really\nimportant work you do. - Everybody watch Kid Cosmic. - I appreciate the class, the hilarity that you\nbrought here today, man, this is an amazing conversation. Thank you for the work you do. Thank you, thank you. And for me, who deeply\ncares about education, higher education, thank you for holding the MITs\nand the Harvard's accountable for doing right by the\npeople that walk their halls. So thank you so much for talking today. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Greg Lukianoff. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with\nsome words from Noam Chomsky. \"If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of\nspeech for views you don't like. Gables was in favor of freedom\nof speech for views he liked, so was Stalin. If you're in favor of freedom of speech, that means you're in\nfavor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."

  "full_text": "- If the goal is the\nproject of human knowledge, which is to know the world as it is, you cannot know the world as it is without knowing what people really think and what people really think is an incredibly important fact to know. So every time you're actually\nsaying \"you can't say that\" you're actually depriving\nyourself of the knowledge of what people really think. You're causing what Timur Kuran, who's on our Board of Advisor, it's called preference falsification. You end up with an inaccurate\npicture of the world, which by the way, in a lot of cases, because there are activists who want to restrict more speech, they actually tend to think\nthat people are more prejudice than they might be. And actually one very real practical way it makes things worse is\nwhen you censor people, it doesn't change their opinion, it just encourages them to\nnot share it with people who will get them in trouble. So it leads them to talk to people who they already agree with and group polarization takes off. - The following is a\nconversation with Greg Lukianoff, free speech advocate,\nfirst-amendment attorney, president and CEO of FIRE, the Foundation for Individual\nRights and Expression. And he's the author of\n\"Unlearning Liberty\", co-author with Jonathan Haidt of \"Coddling of the American Mind\" and co-author with Rikki Schlott of a new book coming out in October that you should definitely\npre-order now called \"The Canceling of the American Mind\" which is a definitive\naccounting of the history, present and future of cancel culture. A term used and overused\nin public discourse, but rarely studied and understood\nwith the depth and rigor that Greg and Ricky do in this book and in part in this conversation. Freedom of speech is important, especially on college campuses, the very place that should serve as the battleground of ideas, including weird and controversial ones that should encourage bold\nrisk-taking, not conformity. This is a Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Greg Lukianoff. Let's start with a big question. What is cancel culture? Now, you've said that you don't\nlike the term as it's been, quote, dragged through the\nmud and abused endlessly by a whole host of controversial figures. Nevertheless, we have\nthe term, what is it? - Cancel culture is the\nuptick of campaigns, especially successful campaigns starting around 2014 to\nget people fired, expelled, deplatformed, et cetera, for speech that would\nnormally be protected by the First Amendment. And I always say would be protected because we're talking about\ncircumstances in which it isn't necessarily where\nthe First Amendment applies. But what I mean is like\nas an analog to say things you couldn't lose your\njob as a public employee for, and also the climate of fear that's resulted from that phenomenon, the fact that you can lose your job for having the wrong opinion. And it wasn't subtle that\nthere was an uptick in this, particularly on campus around 2014. John Ronson wrote a book called, \"So You've Been Publicly Shamed.\" It came out in 2015 already\ndocumenting this phenomena. I wrote a book called\n\"Freedom from Speech\" in 2014 but it really was in 2017 when you started seeing this\nbe directed at professors. And when it comes to\nthe number of professors that we've seen be targeted\nand lose their jobs. I've been doing this for 22 years and I've seen nothing like it. - So there's so many things\nI want to ask you here. But one, actually, just looking\nat the organization of FIRE, can you explain what the organization is because it's interconnected\nto this whole fight in the rise of cancel culture, in the fight for freedom of speech since 2014 and before. - So FIRE was founded in\n1999 by Harvey Silverglate. He is a famous civil liberties attorney. He's been on the show. He's the person who actually found me out in my very happy life\nout in San Francisco, but knew I was looking\nfor a first-amendment job. I'd gone to law school\nspecifically to do First Amendment. And he found me, which was pretty cool. His protege, Kathleen Sullivan was the dean of Stanford Law School and this remains the best\ncompliment I ever got in my life, is that she recommended me to Harvey. And since that's the whole\nreason why I went to law school, I was excited to be a part\nof this new organization. The other co-founder of\nFIRE is Alan Charles Kors. He's just an absolute genius. He is one of the leading\nexperts in the world on the enlightenment, and\nparticularly about Voltaire. And if any of your listeners\ndo like the great courses, he has a lecture on Blaise Pascal, and Blaise, of course, is\nfamous for the Pascal's wager. And I left it just so moved and impressed and with a depth of understanding of how important this person was. - That's interesting. You mentioned to me\noffline, connected to this, that at least it runs in parallel or there's a connection\nbetween the love of science and the love of the freedom of speech. - [Greg] Yes. - Can you maybe elaborate\nwhere that connection is? - Sure. I think that for those of\nus who are really, you know, have devoted our lives\nto freedom of speech, one thing that we are into,\nwhether we know it or not, is epistemology, the study\nand philosophy of knowledge. Freedom speech has lots of moral and philosophical dimensions, but from a pragmatic\nstandpoint, it is necessary because we're creatures of\nincredibly limited knowledge. We are incredibly self deceiving. I always love the fact that\nyou've all heard Harari refers to the enlightenment\nas the discovery of ignorance, because that's exactly what it was. It was suddenly being like,\nwow, hold on a second. All this incredibly\ninteresting folk wisdom we got which by the way can be\nsurprisingly reliable here and there when you start testing,\na lot of it is nonsense. And it doesn't hold up, even our ideas about the way things fall. As you know, Galileo established,\nlike even our intuitions, they're just wrong. And so a lot of the early\nhistory of freedom of speech, it was happening at the same time as sort of the scientific revolution. So a lot of the early debates\nabout freedom of speech were tied in. So certainly Galileo. I always point out like Kepler was probably like the\neven more radical idea that there weren't even perfect spheres. But at the same time, largely because of the\ninvention of the printing press, you also had all these\npolitical developments. And you know, I always talk\nabout Jan Hus, a famous Czech, the hero who was burned at\nthe stake and I think in 1419, but he was basically Luther\nbefore the printing press, before Luther could get his word out. He didn't stand a chance. And that was exactly what Jan Hus was. But a century later, thanks\nto the printing press, everyone could know what Luther thought. And boy did they. But it led to of course, this completely crazy\nhyper disrupted period in European history. - Well, you mentioned to\njump around a little bit, the First Amendment. First of all, what is the First Amendment and what is the connection to you between the First Amendment, the freedom of speech and cancel culture? - Sure. So I'm a First Amendment\nlawyer as I mentioned, and that's my passion. That's what I studied. And I think American First Amendment law is incredibly interesting. In one sentence, the First Amendment is\ntrying to get rid of basically all the reasons why humankind had been killing each other\nfor its entire existence. That we weren't going to\nfight anymore over opinion, we weren't gonna fight\nanymore of religion. That you have the right to\napproach your government for redress grievances. That you have the freedom to associate, that all of these things\nin one sentence we're like, \"Nope, the government\nwill no longer interfere with your right to have these\nfundamental human rights. And so one thing that makes\nFIRE a little different from other organizations is however, we're not just a First\nAmendment organization. We are a free speech organization. But at the same time, a lot of what I think free\nspeech is, can be well explained with reference to a lot\nof First Amendment law. Partially because in American history, some of our smartest people have been thinking about\nwhat the parameters of freedom of speech are in relationship to the First Amendment. And a lot of those principles, they transfer very well\njust as pragmatic ideas. So like the biggest sin\nin terms of censorship is called viewpoint discrimination. That essentially you\nallow freedom of speech except for that opinion. And it's found to be\nkind of more defensible and I think this makes sense that if you set up a forum and like we're only gonna\ntalk about economics to exclude people who wanna\ntalk about a different topic. But it's considered\nrightfully a bigger deal if you've set up a forum for economics. But we're not gonna let people talk about that kind of economics or have that opinion on\neconomics most particularly. So a lot of the principles\nfrom First Amendment law actually make a lot of philosophical sense as good principles for\nwhen, like what is protected and unprotected speech, what should get you in trouble,\nhow you actually analyze it, which is why we actually\ntry in our definition of cancel culture to work in some of the First Amendment\nnorms just in the definition. So we don't have to bog\ndown on them as well. - You're saying so many\ninteresting things, but if you can linger on the\nviewpoint discrimination, is there any gray area\nof discussion there? Like what is and isn't economics\nfor the example you gave? - [Greg] Yeah. - I mean is it a science, or is it an art to draw lines\nof what is and isn't allowed? - Yeah. You know, if you're\nsaying that something is or is not economics, well you can say everything's economics and therefore I want to talk about poetry. There'd be some line\ndrawing exercise in there, but let's say once you decide\nto open up, to poetry even it's a big difference between saying, okay, now we're open to\npoetry, but you can't say, you know, Dante was bad. Like that's a forbidden\nopinion now officially in this otherwise open forum that would immediately\nat an intuitive level strike people as a bigger problem than just saying that\npoetry isn't economics. - I mean, that intuitive\nlevel that you speak to, I hope that all of us have\nthat kind of basic intuition when a line is crossed. It's the same thing for like pornography. - Yes. - When you see it, I think there's the\nsame level of intuition that should be applied\nacross the board here. And it's when that\nintuition becomes deformed by whatever forces of society, that's when it starts\nto feel like censorship. - Yeah I mean, people\nfind it a different thing. If someone loses their job simply for their political opinion, even if that employer has every right in the world to fire you, I think Americans should\nstill be like, well it's true. They have every right in the world. And I'm not making a legal case that maybe you shouldn't fire someone for their political opinion,\nbut think that through. Like, what kind of society\ndo we wanna live in? And it's been funny watching,\nand I point this out, yes, I will defend businesses, First Amendment rights of association to be able to have the legal right to decide who works for them. But from a moral or philosophical matter, if you think through the implications of, if every business in America becomes an expressive association in addition to being a profit\nmaximizing organization, that would be a disaster for democracy because you would end up in a situation where people would actually\nbe saying to themselves, I don't think I can actually\nsay what I really think and still believe I can keep my job. And that's where I was worried,\nI felt like we were headed 'cause a lot of the initial response to people getting\ncanceled was very simply, oh, but they have the right\nto get rid of this person and that's the beginning\nand end of the discussion. And I thought that was a dodge, I thought that wasn't\nactually a very serious way that if you care about\nboth the First Amendment and the freedom of speech,\nof thinking it through. - So to you, just to clarify, the First Amendment is\nkind of a legal embodiment of the ideal of freedom of speech and then freedom of speech. - As applied to government. - And it's very specific,\napplied to government and freedom of speech is the\napplication of the principle to like everything including like kind of the high level philosophical ideal of the value of people being\nable to speak their mind. - Yeah, it's an older,\nbolder, more expansive idea. And you can have a situation, and I talk about countries\nthat have good free speech law, but not necessarily great\nfree speech culture. And I talk about how when we\nsometimes make this distinction between free speech law\nand free speech culture, we're thinking in a\nvery cloudy kind of way. And what I mean by that\nis that laws generally, particularly in a common law country, it's the reflection of norms. Judges are people too. And in a lot of cases, common law is supposed to\nactually take our intuitive ideas of fairness and place them into the law. So if you actually have a culture that doesn't appreciate free speech from a philosophical standpoint, it's not going to be able\nto protect free speech for the long haul, even in\nthe law 'cause eventually, that's one of the reasons\nwhy I worry so much about some of these terrible\ncases coming out of law schools because I fear that even though, sure, American First Amendment law is very strongly protective\nof First Amendment for now, it's not gonna stay that way. If you have generations\nof law students graduating who actually think there's nothing, there's no higher goal than shouting down you're an opponent. - Yeah, so that's why\nso much of your focus, or a large fraction of your\nfocus is on the higher education or education period, is because education is\nthe foundation of culture. - Yeah, you have this\nhistory, you know, '64, you have the free speech\nmovement on Berkeley, and in '65 you have Repressive\ntolerance by Herbert Marcuse, which was a declaration of,\nby the way, we on the left, we should have free speech, but we should have free speech for us. I mean, I went back and\nreread repressive tolerance and how clear it is. I had forgotten that it\nreally is kind of like, and these so-called\nconservatives and right wingers, we need to repress them because\nthey're regressive thinkers. It really doesn't come out to\nanything more sophisticated than the very old idea\nthat our people are good, they get free speech, they should keep it. Other side bad. We should not have, and we\nhave to retrain society. And of course, like, it\nends up being another, he was also a fan of Mao,\nso it's not surprising that of course the\nsystem would have to rely on some kind of totalitarian system. But that was a laughable\nposition, you know, say 30, 40 years ago. The idea that essentially, you know, free speech for me, not for the... As the great free speech\nchampion Hentoff used to say was something that you were\nsupposed to be embarrassed by. But I saw this when I\nwas in law school in '97. I saw this when I was\ninterning at the ACLU in '99, that there was a slow\nmotion train wreck coming that essentially there was\nthese bad ideas from campus that had been taking\non more and more steam of basically no free\nspeech for my opponent were actually becoming\nmore, more and more accepted and partially because academia was becoming less and\nless viewpoint diverse. I think that as my co-author\nJonathan Haidt points out that when you have low\nviewpoint diversity, people start thinking in\na very kind of tribal way. And if you don't have\nthe respected dissenters, you don't have the people\nthat you can point to that are like, \"Hey,\nthis is a smart person.\" This is a smart, reasonable, decent person that I disagree with. So I guess not everyone\nthinks alike on this issue. You start getting much more\nkind of like only bad people, only heretics, only\nblasphemers, only right wingers can actually think in this way. - Every time you say something, I always have a million thoughts and a million questions that pop up. But since you mentioned\nthere's a kind of drift as you write about in the\nbook and you mentioned now there's a drift towards\nthe left in academia, which would also maybe\ndraw a distinction here between the left and the right and the cancel culture as\nyou present in your book is not necessarily associated with any one political viewpoint. That there's mechanisms on both sides. - [Greg] Oh yeah. - That result in cancellation and censorship in violation\nof freedom of speech. - So one thing I wanna\nbe really clear about is the book takes on both\nright and left cancel culture. They're different in a lot\nof ways and definitely, cancel culture from the left\nis more important in academia where the left dominates. But we talk a lot about cancel culture coming from legislatures. We talk a lot about cancel\nculture on campus as well, because even though most of the attempts that come from on campus\nto get people canceled are still from the left, there are a lot of attacks\nthat come from the right that come from attempts by\ndifferent organizations. And sometimes when there\nare stories in Fox News, like they'll go after professors and about one third of the attempts to get professors punished\nthat are successful actually do come from the right and we talk about attempts\nto get books banned, in the book, we talk about\nsuing the Florida legislature. Ron DeSantis had something\ncalled the Stop-Woke Act, which we told everyone this\nis laughably unconstitutional. They tried to ban particular\ntopics in higher ed and we're like, no, this is a joke. Like this will be laughed out of court. And they didn't listen to\nus and they brought it, they passed it and we sued and we won. Now they're trying again with something that's\nequally as unconstitutional and we will sue again and we will win. - Can you elaborate on Stop-Woke Act? This is presumably trying\nto limit certain topics from being taught in school? - Yeah, basically woke topics. It came out of the sort of attempt to get at critical race theory. So it's topics related to\nrace, gender, et cetera. I don't remember exactly how\nthey tried to cabinet it to CRT but when you actually, the law's really well established that you can't tell higher education what they're allowed to teach without violating the First Amendment. And when this got in front of\na judge, it was exactly as... He was exactly as skeptical\nof it as we thought he'd be. I think he called this dystopian\nand it wasn't a close call. - So if you're against\nthat kind of teaching, the right way to fight\nit is by making the case that it's not a good idea\nas part of the curriculum as opposed to banning\nit from the curriculum. - Yeah. The state doesn't have the\npower to simply say to ban, what professors in higher education teach. Now, it gets a little more complicated when you talk about K through 12 because the state has a role in deciding what public K through 12 teaches because they're your kids. It's taxpayer funded and generally the legislature is involved. There is democratic\noversight of that process. - So for K through 12, is there also a lean towards the left in terms of the administration\nthat manages the curriculum? - Yeah, there definitely\nis in K through 12. I mean, my kids go to public school. I have a five and a seven year old and they have lovely teachers, but we have run into a lot of problems with education schools at FIRE and a lot of the graduates\nof education school end up being the administrators who clamp down on free\nspeech in higher education. And so I've been trying\nto think of positive ways to take on some of this, some of the problems that\nI see in K through 12. I thought that the\nattempt to just dictate, you won't teach the following\n10 books or 20 books or 200 books was the wrong way to do it. Now when it comes to deciding what books are in the curriculum, again that's something a legislature\nactually can have some say in and that's pretty uncontroversial\nin terms of the law. But when it comes to how you fight it, I had something that since I'm kind of stuck with the formula I called \"Empowering of the American Mind\" I gave principles that were inconsistent with the sort of group think and heavy emphasis on identity politics that some of the critics are\nrightfully complaining about in K through 12. And that is actually in\n\"Canceling of the American Mind\" but I have a more\ndetailed explanation of it that I'm gonna be putting up on my blog, the eternally radical idea. - Is it possible it's legally... This is a silly question perhaps. Create an extra protection for certain kinds of\nliterature, 1984 or something to remain in the curriculum. I mean it's already, it's\nall protected, I guess. I guess to protect against administrators from fiddling too much\nwith the curriculum, like stabilizing the curriculum. I don't know what the machinery of the K through 12 public school. - In K through 12, state legislatures... - [Lex] They're part of that. - They're part of that\nand they can say like, you should teach the following books. Now of course people are\nalways a little bit worried that if they were to recommend, teach the Declaration of Independence, that it will end up being, well they're gonna teach the\nDeclaration of Independence was just to protect\nslavery, which it wasn't. - Yeah, so teaching a\nparticular topic matters which textbooks you choose, which perspective you take,\nall that kind of stuff. Of course there's like religion starts to creep into the\nwhole question of like, is the Bible, are you allowed to incorporate\nthat into education? - Yeah, I mean, I'm an atheist with an intense interest in religion. I actually read the entire Bible this year just 'cause I do stuff like that. And I never actually had read it from beginning to end. Then I read the Quran 'cause you know, and I'm gonna try to do the\nBook of Mormon, but, you know. - Well, you're so fascinating. Do you recommend doing that? - I think you should just to know 'cause it's such a touchstone in the way people talk about things. It can get pretty tedious. But I even made myself read through all of the very specific instructions on how tall the different\nparts of the temple need to be and how long the garbs need to be and what shape they need\nto be and what like... And those go on a lot. That surprisingly a big chunk of Exodus, I thought that was more like\nin Leviticus and Deuteronomy, but then you get to\nbooks like Job, you know? Wow. I mean Job is such a read and no way Job originally had that ending. Like Job is basically, it starts out as this perverse\nbet between God and Satan about whether or not they\ncan actually make a good man renounce God, and initially they can't. It's all going very predictably. And then they finally really tortured Job and he turns into the best. Why is God cruel? How\ncould God possibly exist? How could a kind God do these things? And he turns into like the\nbest lawyer in the entire world and he defeats everyone. All the people who come to argue with him, he argues the pants off of them. And then suddenly at the end\nGod shows up and he's like, well, you know, I am everywhere. And it's a very confusing answer. He gets an answer kind of like, I am there when Lionesses give birth and\nI am there, and by the way, there's this giant monster\nLeviathan that's very big and it's very scary and I\nhave to manage the universe and I'm kind of like, God, are you saying that you're very busy? Is that essentially your argument to Job and you don't mention the\nwhole kind of like that I have a bet, that's\nwhy I was torturing you. That doesn't come up. And then at the end he decides, Job's like, oh no, you're totally right. I was totally wrong. Sorry. And God says like, I'm gonna punish those people\nwho tried to argue with you and didn't win. So he gets rid of the... I don't know exactly what he\ndoes to them, I don't remember. And then he gives Job all his money back and he makes him super prosperous. And I'm like, no way that was the original ending of that book because this was like, this was clearly a beloved\nnovel that they were like, but it can't have that ending. - Okay. - So it's a long way of saying I actually think it's worthwhile. Some of it was, you're always kind of surprised\nwhen you end up in the part, like there are parts of it\nthat will sneak up on you, kind of like Isaiah is a trip. Ecclesiastes, Depeche mode. - And you said you also the Quran. - [Greg] Yeah which was fascinating. - So it'd be interesting to ask, is there a tension between\nthe study of religious texts or the following of religion\nand just believing in God and following the various\naspects of religion with freedom of speech. - In the First Amendment, we have something that we\ncall the religion clause. And I've never liked calling it just that because it's two brilliant\nthings right next to each other. The state may not establish\nan official religion, but it cannot interfere with your right to practice your religion. That's beautiful. Two things at the same time. And I think they're both exactly right and I think sometimes the\nright gets very excited of the free exercise clause and the left gets very\nexcited about establishment. And I like the fact that we\nhave both of 'em together. Now, how does this relate\nto freedom of speech and how does it relate to the curriculum like we were talking about? I actually think it would be great if public schools could teach the Bible, like in the sense of like read\nit as a historical document. But back when I was at the ACLU, every time I saw people trying this, it always turned into them\nactually advocating for, a Catholic or a Protestant\nor Orthodox even kind of like read on religion. So if you actually make it\ninto something advocating for a particular view on religion, then it crosses into the\nestablishment clause side. So Americans haven't figured\nout a way to actually teach it. So it's probably better\nthat you learn about it outside of a public school class. - Do you think it's\npossible to teach religion from like world religions kind of force without disrespecting the religions? - I think the answer is it depends on from whose perspective. - Well, like the practitioner say you're like an Orthodox follower\nof a particular religion. - [Greg] Yeah. - Is it possible to not piss you off in teaching like all the\nmajor religions of the world? - For some people, the bottom line is you\nhave to teach it as true. And with that, under those conditions, then the answer is no. You can't teach it without\noffending someone at least. - Can't you say these\npeople believe it's true? Can you reform it? So you have to walk on\neggshells essentially. - You can try really hard and you will still make some people angry, but serious people will be like, oh no, you actually tried to be\nfair to the beliefs here. And I try to be respectful\nas much as I can about a lot of this. I still find myself much\nmore drawn to both Buddhism and stoicism though. - Where do I go? Okay, one interesting thing to\nget back to college campuses is FIRE keeps the college\nfree speech rankings. - [Greg] Yes. - At rankings.thefire.org. - [Greg] I'm very proud of them. - I highly recommend 'cause forget even just the ranking, you get to learn a lot\nabout the universities from this entirely different perspective than people are used\nto when they go to pick whatever university they want to go to. It just gives another\nperspective on the whole thing and it gives quotes from\npeople that are students there and so on, like about their experiences and it gives different- Maybe you could speak to\nthe various measures here before we talk about who's in the top five and who's in the bottom five. What are the different parameters that contribute to the evaluation? - So people have been\nasking me since day one to do a ranking of schools\naccording to freedom of speech. And even though we had the\nbest database in existence of campus speech codes, policies that universities have\nthat violate First Amendment or First Amendment norms, we\nalso have the best database of, we call the Disinvitation Database, but it's actually it's better named the deplatforming database, which is what we're gonna call it. - And these are all cases\nwhere somebody was invited as a speaker to campus\nand they were disinvited. - Disinvited or deplatforming\nalso includes shouting down. - So they showed up and\nthey couldn't really speak. - Yeah, exactly. And so having that, what we really needed in order to have some\nserious social science to really make a serious argument about what the ranking was,\nwas to be able to, one, get a better sense of how many professors were actually getting\npunished during this time. And then the biggest missing element was to be able to ask students directly what the environment\nwas like on that campus for freedom of speech. Are you comfortable\ndisagreeing with each other? Are you comfortable disagreeing\nwith your professors? Do you think violence is acceptable in response to a speaker? Do you think shouting down is okay? Do you think blocking people's\naccess to a speaker is okay? And once we were able to get\nall those elements together, we first did a test run I\nthink in 2019, about 50. And we've been doing\nit for four years now, always trying to make the\nmethodology more and more precise to better reflect the actual environment at particular schools. And this year the number one school was Michigan Technological University, which was a nice surprise. The number two school was\nactually Auburn University, which was nice to see. In the top 10, the most well-known prestigious\nschool is actually UVA, which did really well this year. University of Chicago was not happy that they weren't number one, but University of Chicago was 13 and they had been number one or in the top three for\nyears prior to that. - Really? So can you explain?\nIt's almost surprising. Is it because of like the really strong\neconomics departments and things like this or what, why? - They had a case involving a student, they wouldn't recognize a\nchapter of Turning Point USA and they made a very classic argument and classic in the bad way that we hear campuses across the country. Oh, we have a campus Republican, so we don't need this\nadditional conservative group. And we're like, no, I'm sorry. Like we've seen dozens and dozens if not hundreds of attempts to get this one particular\nconservative student group derecognized or not recognized. And so we told them like, listen like we told them at FIRE\nthat we consider this serious and they wouldn't recognize the group. So that's a point down in our ranking. And that was enough to knock them from- They probably would've been\nnumber two in the rankings, but now they're 13 out of 248. They're still one of the\nbest schools in the country. I have no problem saying that. The school that did not do\nso well at a negative 10.69, negative 10.69 and we rounded\nup to zero was Harvard. And Harvard has been not\nvery happy with that result. - The only school to\nreceive the abysmal ranking. - [Greg] Yeah, and there\nare a couple of people- - Oh, Harvard. - Oh, Harvard. And there are a couple of people who have actually been really, I think making a mistake by\ngetting very Harvard sounding by being like, I've had\nstatisticians look at this and they think your methodology is a joke and like pointing out and this\ncase wasn't that important. And that scholar wasn't that scholar. Like one of the arguments\nagainst one of the scholars that we counted against them for punishing was that that wasn't a very\nfamous or influential scholar. And I'm kind of like, so your your argument seems to be snobbery like essentially that like you're not understanding our\nmethodology for one thing. And then you're saying that actually that scholar wasn't\nimportant enough to count. And by the way, Harvard,\nby the way, Harvard... - This is the Harvard camera. - Even if we took all of\nyour arguments as true, even if we decided to get\nrid of those two professors, you would still be in negative numbers. You would still be dead last, you would still be after\nGeorgetown and Penn and neither of those schools\nare good for freedom of speech. - I should say, the bottom five is the University of Pennsylvania, like you said, Penn, the\nUniversity of South Carolina, Georgetown University,\nand Fordham University. - All very well earned. They have so many bad cases\nat all of those schools. - What's the best way to find\nyourself in the bottom five if you are a university? What's the fastest way to\nthat negative, to that zero? - A lot of deplatforming. When we looked at the bottom five, 81% of attempts to get\nspeakers deplatformed were successful at the bottom five. There were a couple of\nschools, I think Penn included, where every single attempt, every time a student like objected, a student group objected\nto that speaker coming, they canceled this speech. And I think Georgetown\nwas 100% success rate. I think Penn had 100% success rate. I think Harvard did stand up for a couple, but mostly people got\ndeplatformed there as well. - So how do you push\nback on deplatforming? Well, who would do it?\nIs it other students? Is it faculty? Is it the administration? What's the dynamics of\npushing back, of basically, 'cause I imagine some of it is culture, but I imagine every university\nhas a bunch of students who will protest basically every speaker. And it's a question of how\nyou respond to that protest. - Well, here's the dirty little secret about like the big change in 2014 and FIRE and me and Haidt\nhave been very clear that the big change that we saw on campus was that for most of my career, students were great on freedom of speech. They were the best\nconstituency for free speech, absolutely unambiguously\nuntil about 2013, 2014. And it was only in 2014\nwhere we had these very, kind of sad for us experience where suddenly students were the ones advocating for deplatforming\nand new speech codes kind of in a similar way that\nthey had been doing in say like the mid eighties for example. But here's the dirty little secret. It's not just the students. It's students and administrators. Sometimes only a handful of them though working together to make, to create some of these problems. And this was exactly\nwhat happened at Stanford when Kyle Duncan, a fifth circuit judge tried\nto speak at my alma mater and a fifth of the class\nshowed up to shout him down. It was a real showing\nof what was going on. That 10 minutes into the shout down of a fifth circuit judge, and\nI keep on emphasizing that 'cause I'm a constitutional lawyer, fifth circuit judges are big deals. They're one level below the Supreme Court. About a fifth of the school\nshows up to shout him down. After 10 minutes of shouting him down, an administrator, a DEI\nadministrator gets up with a prepared speech that she's written, that's a seven minute long speech where she talks about free speech, maybe the juice isn't worth the squeeze. And we're at this law school where people could learn\nto challenge these norms. So it's clear that there was coordination amongst some of these administrators. And from talking to students\nthere, they were in meetings, extensive meetings for a long time. They show up, do a shout down, then they take an additional seven minutes to lecture the speaker on free speech. The juice of free speech, not being worth the squeeze. And then for the rest of it, it's just constant\nheckling after she leaves. This is clearly and\nsomething very similar, happened a number of times at Yale where it was very clearly administrators were helping along with a\nlot of these disruptions. So I think every time there is\na shout down at a university, the investigation should\nbe first and foremost, did administrators help\ncreate this problem? Did they do anything to stop it? Because I think a lot of\nwhat's really going on here is the hyper bureaucratization\nof universities with a lot more ideological people who think of their primary job as basically like policing\nspeech more or less. They're encouraging students, sorry, they're encouraging students who have opinions they\nlike to do shout downs and that's why they really\nneed to investigate this. And it is at Stanford, the administrator who gave the prepared remarks about the juice not\nbeing worth the squeeze. She has not been invited back to Stanford, but she's one of the only\nexamples I can think of when these things happen a lot where an administrator\nclearly facilitated something that was a shout down or deplatforming or resulted in a professor getting fired or resulted in a student getting expelled where the administrator\nhas got off scot free or probably in some cases\neven gotten a promotion. - And so a small number of administrators, maybe even a single administrator could participate in the\nencouraging and the organization and thereby empower the whole process. - And that's something I've seen throughout my entire career. And the only thing, it's kind of hard to catch this sort of\nin the act, so to speak. And that's one of the reasons\nwhy it's helpful for people to know about this. There was this amazing case, this was at University of Washington and we actually featured this\nin a documentary made in 2015 that came out in 2015, 2016\ncalled, \"Can We Take A Joke?\" And this was when we started noticing something was changing on campus. We also heard that comedians were saying that they couldn't use\ntheir good humor anymore. This was right around the\ntime that Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock said that they\ndidn't wanna play on campuses 'cause they couldn't be funny. But we featured a case of a comedian who wanted to do a musical called \"The Passion of the Musical\" making fun of \"The Passion of the Christ\" with the stated goal\nof offending everyone, every group equally. It was very much a South Park mission. And it's an unusual case because we actually got\ndocumentation of administrators buying tickets for angry\nstudents and holding an event where they trained them to\njump up in the middle of it and shout \"I'm offended.\" Like, they bought them tickets, they sent them to this thing with the goal of shouting it down. Now, unsurprisingly, when you send an angry group of students to shut down a play, it's\nnot gonna end at just, \"I'm offended.\" And it got heated. There were death threats being thrown. And then the Pullman\nWashington police told Chris, Chris Lee, the guy who made the play, that they wouldn't actually protect him. Now it's not every day you're gonna have that\nkind of hard evidence that actually seeing the\nadministrators be so brazen that they recorded the fact that they bought them\ntickets and sent them. But I think a lot of\nthat stuff is going on. And I think it's a good excuse to cut down on one of the big problems in higher education today, which\nis hyper bureaucratization. - In your experience,\nis there a distinction between administrators and faculty in terms of perpetrators\nof these kinds of things? So if we got rid of all,\nlike Harvey's talked about getting rid of a large\npercentage of the administration, does that help fix the problem? Or is the faculty also... - [Greg] Yeah. - A small percent of the faculty also part of the encouraging\nin the organization of these kind of cancel models? - Yeah. And that's something that has\nbeen profoundly disappointing is that when you look at the huge uptick in attempts to get professors\nfired that we've seen over the last 10 years and\nactually over the last 22 years, as far as far back as our records go. At first they were overwhelmingly\nled by administrators, attempts to get professors punished. And that was most, you know, I'd say that was my career up until 2013 was fighting back at\nadministrative excesses. Then you start having the problem in 2014 of students trying to get people canceled. And that really accelerated in 2017. And the number, so one way, one thing that makes it easier to document are the petitions to get\nprofessors fired or punished and how disproportionately\nthat those actually do come from students. But another big uptick\nhas been fellow professors demanding that their fellow\nprofessors get punished. And that to me- - [Lex] Makes me really sad. - It's kind of shameful. You shouldn't be proud\nof signing the petition to get your fellow professor and what's even more shameful is that this has almost\nbecome a cliche within FIRE when someone is facing one of\nthese cancellation campaigns as a professor. I would get letters from\nsome of my friends saying, \"I am so sorry this has happened to you.\" And these were the same people who publicly signed the\npetition to get them fired. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Integrity. Integrity is an important\nthing in this world. And I think some of it, I'm so surprised people\ndon't stand up more for this 'cause there's so much hunger for it. And if you have the guts as\na faculty or an administrator to really stand up with\neloquence, with rigor, with integrity, I feel like it's impossible\nfor anyone to do anything because there's such a\nhunger, it's so refreshing. - [Greg] Yeah. - I think everybody agrees\nthat freedom of speech is a good thing. - [Greg] Oh, I don't, I don't. - Well, okay, sorry, sorry. - [Greg] I don't agree. - The majority of people\neven at the universities that there's a hunger, but it's almost like this\nkind of nervousness around it because there's a small\nnumber of loud voices that are doing the shouting. So I mean, again, that's where great leadership comes in. And so, presidents of universities should probably be making\nclear declarations of like, this is a place where we value\nthe freedom of expression. - And this was all throughout my career, a president, a university president who\nputs their foot down early and says, \"Nope, we are not entertaining\nfiring this professor. We are not expelling this student.\" It ends the issue often very fast. Although sometimes, and this\nis where you can really tell the administrative involvement,\nstudents will do things like take over the president's office and then that takeover will\nbe catered by the university. People will point this out\nsometimes as being kind of like, oh, it was clearly it,\nlike my friend Sam Abrams, when they tried to get him\nfired at Sarah Lawrence College. And that was one of the\ntimes that it was used as kind of like, oh, this\nwas hostile to the university because the students took\nover the president's office. And I'm like, no, they let them take over\nthe president's office. And I don't know if that\nwas one of the cases in which the takeover was catered, but if there was ever\na sort of like a sign that's kind of like, yes, this is actually\nreally quite friendly. - Well in some sense, like protesting and having\nreally strong opinions, even like ridiculous, crazy,\nwild opinions is a good thing. It's just, it shouldn't\nlead to actual firing or deplatforming of people.\nLike it's good to protest. It's just not good for\nuniversity to support that and take action based on it. - And this is one of those like\ntensions in First Amendment that actually I think has a\npretty easy release essentially. You absolutely have the\nright to devote your life to ending freedom of speech\nand ridiculing it as a concept. And there are people\nwho really can come off as very contemptible\nabout even the philosophy of freedom of speech. And we will defend your right to do that. We will also disagree with you. And if you try to get a professor fired, we'll be on the other side of that. Now I think you had Randy\nKennedy who I really, I love him. I think he's a great guy. But he criticized us for\nour deplatforming database as saying, this is saying that students can't protest speakers. I'm like, okay, that's silly. We FIRE as an organization, have defended the right\nto protest all the time. We are constantly defending\nthe rights to protestors not believing that the protestors have the right to say\nthis would like basically, that would be punishing the speakers. We're not calling for\npunishing the protestors. But what we are saying is you\ncan't let the protestors win if they're demanding someone be fired for their freedom of speech. - So the line there is\nbetween protestors protesting and the university taking\naction based on the protest. - Yeah, exactly. And of course shout downs,\nthat's just mob censorship. And that's something where the university, the way you deal with that\ntension in First Amendment law is essentially kind of\nlike the one positive duty that the government has. The negative duty, the thing that it's not\nallowed to do is censor you. But it's positive duty is that if I want to say awful\nthings or for that matter, great things that aren't\npopular in a public park, you can't let the crowd\njust shout me down. You can't allow what's\ncalled a heckler's veto. - Heckler's veto. That's so interesting 'cause I feel like that comes into play on social media somehow because there's this whole\ndiscussion about censorship and freedom of speech. But to me, the carrot question\nis almost more interesting once the freedom of speech is established is how do you incentivize\nhigh quality debate and disagreement? - I'm thinking a lot about that. And that's one of the things we talk about in \"Canceling of the American Mind\" is arguing towards truth. And that cancel culture\nis cruel, it's merciless, it's anti-intellectual, but it also will never get\nyou anywhere in your truth. And you are going to waste so much time destroying your opponents in something that can actually\nnever get you to truth through the process of course, of you never actually\nget directly at truth, you just chip away at falsity. - Yeah. But everybody having a\nmegaphone on the internet with anonymity, it seems like\nit's better than censorship, but it feels like there's\nincentives on top of that you can construct to\nincentivize better discourse. - [Greg] Yeah. - It's like to incentivize somebody who puts a huge amount of effort to make even the most\nridiculous arguments, but basically ones that don't include any of the things you highlight in terms of all the rhetorical tricks to shut down conversations, just make really good\narguments for whatever, it doesn't matter if it's\ncommunism, for fascism, whatever the heck you want to say. - [Greg] Yeah. - But do it with scale,\nwith historical context, with steelman on the other side, all those kind of elements. - We try to make three\nmajor points in the book. One is just simply cancel culture is real. It's a historic era and\nit's on a historic scale. The second one is you should\nthink of cancel culture as part of a rhetorical, as a larger lazy, rhetorical approach to what we\nrefer to as winning arguments without winning arguments. And we mean that in two senses without having winning arguments or actually having won arguments. And we talk about all the different, what we call rhetorical fortresses, that both the left and the right have that prevent you from... That allow you to just dismiss the person or dodge the argument without actually ever\ngetting to the substance of the argument. Third part is just, how do we fix it. But the rhetorical fortress stuff is actually something\nI'm very passionate about because it interferes with\nour ability to get at truth and it wastes time and\nfrankly it also can, since cancel culture is part\nof that rhetorical tactic, it can also ruin lives. - It would actually be really fun to talk about this particular\naspect of the book. And I highly recommend if\nyou're listening to this go pre-order the book now.\nWhen does it come out? - October 17th. - Okay, \"The Canceling\nof the American Mind.\" Okay, so in the book you also have a list of\ncheap rhetorical tactics that both the left and the right use. And then you have a list of tactics that the left uses and the right uses. So there's the rhetorical, the perfect rhetorical\nfortress that the left uses and the efficient rhetorical\nfortress that the right uses. - Yeah. - First one is whataboutism. - Yeah. - Maybe we can go through a few of them that capture your heart\nin this particular moment as we talk about it. And if you can describe examples of it or if there's aspects\nof it that you see there especially effective. So whataboutism is\ndefending against criticism of your side by bringing\nup the other side's alleged wrongdoing. - I wanna make little cards of these, of all of these tactics and start using them on X all the time because they are so commonly deployed. And whataboutism I put first for a reason. - You know it'd be an interesting idea to actually integrate\nthat into Twitter slash X where people instead of clicking heart, they can click which of the\nrhetorical tactics this is. And then 'cause you know,\nthere's actually community notes. I don't know if you've seen on X there, people can contribute notes\nand it's quite fascinating. It works really, really well. But to give it a little more structure. - Yeah. - That's a really\ninteresting method actually. - Yeah I actually, when I was thinking about\nways that X could be used to argue towards truth,\nI wouldn't wanna have it so that everybody would be bound to that. But I think that, I imagine it almost being\nlike a stream within X that was truth focused, that agrees to some additional rules on how they would argue. - Man, I would love that. Where like there's, in terms of streams that\nintersect and could be separated, the shit talking one where\npeople just enjoy talking shit. - [Greg] Okay, go for it man. - And then there's like\ntruth, and then I mean then there's humor, then\nthere's like good vibes. Like, I'm not like somebody\nwho absolutely needs good vibes all the time, but sometimes- - [Greg] It's nice to have. - It's nice to just log in and not have to see like the drama, the fighting, the bickering,\nthe cancellations, the mobs, all of this. It's good to just see, that's\nwhy I go to Reddit r aww or like one of the cute animals ones where there's cute puppies\nand kittens and it's like. - I just wanna see Ryan Reynolds\nsinging with Will Ferrell. I mean like. - Sometimes that's all you need. - I need that in my heart. - Yeah. Not all the time, just a little bit. And right back to the battle for truth. Okay, so whataboutism. - Whataboutism, yeah, that's everywhere when you look at it,\nwhen you look at Twitter, when you look at social media\nin general, and the first, what we call the obstacle\ncourse is basically time tested, old fashioned, argumentative\ndodges that everybody uses. And whataboutism is just\nbringing up something, like someone makes an\nargument like Biden is corrupt and then someone says,\nwell, Trump was worse. You know, like, and that's\nnot an illegitimate, argument to make back, but it does, it seems to happen every time\nsomeone makes an assertion, someone just points out some\nother thing that was going on and it can get increasingly attenuated from what you're actually trying to argue. And you see this all\nthe time on social media and it's kind of, you know, I was a big fan of John\nStewart's Daily Show, but an awful lot of what the humor was and what the tactic was for arguing was this thing over here. It's like, oh, I'm making this argument about this important problem. Oh actually, there's this\nother problem over here that I'm more concerned about and let's pick on the right here. So January 6th, watching everybody arguing about CHOP, like the occupied part of Seattle or the occupied part of Portland. And basically trying to like, oh, you're bringing up\nthe riot on January 6th. And by the way, I live on\nCapitol Hill, so believe me, I was very aware of like\nhow scary and bad it was. My dad grew up in Yugoslavia\nand that was a night where we all ate dinner in the basement 'cause I'm like, oh,\nwhen this shit goes down, eat in the basement. It was genuinely scary. And people would try to\ndeflect from January 6th being serious by actually\nmaking the argument that, oh, well there are crazy, horrible things happening\nall over the country. Riots that came from some of\nthe social justice protests. And of course the answer is, you can be concerned\nabout both of these things and find them both problems. But if I'm arguing about CHOP, someone bringing up January\n6th isn't super relevant to it. Or if I'm arguing about January 6th, someone bringing up the riots\nin 2020, isn't that helpful. - We took a long dark\njourney from whataboutism. - Yeah. - And related to that is\nstrawmanning and steelmanning. So misrepresenting the perspective of the opposing perspective\nand this is something also I guess is very prevalent and it's difficult to\ndo the reverse of that, which is steelmanning requires empathy, it requires eloquence, it\nrequires understanding, actually doing the\nresearch and understanding the alternative perspective. - My wonderful employee, Angel Eduardo has something\nthat he calls star-manning. And I find myself doing this a lot, it's nice to have two immigrant parents because I remember being in\nSan Francisco in the weird, kind of like ACLU slash\nBirmingham kind of cohort and having a friend\nthere who was an artist who would talk about hating Kansas. And that was his metaphor\nfor middle America is what he meant by it. But he was kind of proud of\nthe fact that he hated Kansas. And I'm like, you gotta understand, I still see all of you a\nlittle bit as foreigners and think about like, change\nthe name of Kansas to Croatia, change the name of Kansas to some- That's what it sounds like to me. And the star-manning idea, which I like, is the idea of being like, so you're saying that you really hate your dominant religious minority. And that's when you start\nactually detaching yourself a little bit from it. How typical, America is\nexceptional in a number of ways. But some of our dynamics\nare incredibly typical. It's one of the reasons why like when people start reading\nThomas Sowell, for example, they start getting hooked. because one of the things he does is he does comparative analysis\nof the country's problems and points out that some of these things that we think are just\nunique to the United States exist in 75% of the rest of\nthe countries in the world. Francis Fukuyama, the book\nthat I'm reading right now, \"The Origins of the Political Order\" actually does this wonderful\njob of pointing out how we're not special\nin a variety of ways. This is actually something\nthat's very much on my mind. And Fukuyama of course, it's a great book. It's stilted a little bit in its writing because his term for one of\nthe things he's concerned about what destroys societies\nis repatrimonialization which is the reversion to societies in which you favor your\nfamily and friends. And I actually think a\nlot of what I'm seeing in the United States, it makes me worried that we might be going through\na little bit of a process of repatrimonialization. And I think that's one of the reasons why people are so angry. I think the prospect\nthat we very nearly seem to have an election that was gonna be, Jeb Bush versus Hillary Clinton. It's like, are we a dynastic country now? Is that what's kind of happening? But also it's one of the reasons why people are getting so\nangry about legacy admissions, about like how much certain families seem to be able to keep their\npeople in the upper classes of the United States perpetually. And believe me, like we\nwere poor when I was a kid and I got to go to one of the fancies. I got to go to Stanford and\nI got to see how people, they treat you differently in\na way that's almost insulting. Like basically, like suddenly to a certain kind of person, I was a legitimate person. And I look at how much\nAmerica relies on Harvard, on Yale to produce its... I'm gonna use a very Marxist\nsounding term, ruling class. And that's one of the reasons why you have to be particularly worried about what goes on at these elite colleges and these elite colleges with the exception\nUniversity of Chicago and UVA do really badly regarding\nfreedom of speech. And that has all sorts of problems. It doesn't bode well for the future of the protection of freedom of speech for the rest of the society. - So can you also empathize\nthere with the folks who voted for Donald Trump? Because as precisely that as a resistance to this kind of momentum\nof the ruling class, this royalty that passes on the rule from generation to generation. - I try really hard to empathize\nwith, to a degree everybody and try to really see\nwhere they're coming from and the anger on the right, I get it. I mean, like, I feel like the book, so \"Coddling the American Mind\" was a book that could be sort of a\ncrowd pleaser to a degree, partially because we\nreally meant what we said in the subtitle that\nthese are good intentions and bad ideas that are hurting people. And if you understand\nit and read the book, you can say it's like, okay, this isn't anybody being malicious, this is people trying\nto protect their kids. They're just doing it in\na way that actually can actually lead to greater\nanxiety, depression, and strangely eventually pose\na threat to freedom of speech. But in this one, we can't be quite. Oh, I haven't even mentioned\nmy brilliant co-author Rikki Schlott, a 23 year old genius. She's amazing. I started working with\nher when she was 20, who's my co-author on this book. So when I'm saying we, I am talking about me and Rikki. - [Lex] She's a libertarian. - [Greg] Libertarian journalist. - [Lex] And a journalist. Yeah, a brilliant mind. - But we can't actually write\nthis in a way that's too kind because cancelers aren't kind. There's a cruelty and a\nmercilessness about it. I mean, I started getting\nreally depressed this past year when I was writing it, and I didn't even want to tell my staff why I was getting so\nanxious and depressed. It's partially because I'm\ntalking about people who will, in some of the cases we're talking about, go to your house, target your kids. So that's a long-winded\nway of saying the... I kind of can get what sort\nof drives the right nuts to a degree in this. I feel like they're\nconstantly feeling like they're being gaslit. Elite education is really\ninsulting to the working class. Like part of the ideology\nthat is dominant right now kind of treats almost 70%\nof the American public, we developed this a little bit in the perfect rhetorical fortress. Like they're to some way illegitimate and not worthy of respect or compassion. - Yeah, the general elitism that radiates self fueling elitism that\nradiates from the people that go to these institutions. - And what's funny is the\nelitism has been repackaged as a kind of... It masquerades as kind\nof infinite compassion that essentially it's based in\na sort of very, to be frank, overly simple ideology and\nover simple explanation of the world and breaking\npeople into groups and judging people on\nhow oppressed they are on the intersection of\ntheir various identities. And it came to that I think initially and it had appeal from\na compassionate core, but it gets used in a way\nthat can be very cruel, very dismissive, compassionless, and allows you to not take seriously most of your fellow human beings. - It's really weird how that happened. Maybe you can explore why a thing that kind of sounds good at first... - [Greg] Yeah. - Can become such a cruel weapon of canceling and hurting\npeople and ignoring people. I mean, this is what you described with a perfect rhetorical fortress which is a set of questions. Maybe you can elaborate on what the perfect\nrhetorical fortress is. - Yeah, so the perfect rhetorical fortress is the way that's been\ndeveloped on the left to not ever get to\nsomeone's actual argument. I wanna make a chart,\nlike a flow chart of this, about like, here's the argument and here\nis this perfect fortress that will deflect you every time from getting to the argument. And I started to notice this certainly when I was in law school, that there were lots of different ways you could dismiss people and\nperfect rhetorical fortress, step one, and I can attest to this because I was guilty of this as well, that you can dismiss people if you can argue that\nthey're conservative. They don't have to be\nconservative to be clear. You just have to say that they are. So I never read Thomas Sowell\nbecause he was a right winger. I didn't read Camille Paglia because someone had convinced\nme she was a right winger. There were lots of authors that, and when I was in law school, among a lot of very bright people, it really was already\nan intellectual habit that if you could designate\nsomething conservative, then you didn't really\nhave to think about it very much anymore or take\nit particularly seriously. That's a childish way of arguing. But nonetheless, I engaged in it. It was a common tactic. I\neven mentioned in the book, there was a time when\na gay activist friend who is I think decidedly to my left, but nonetheless had that\npragmatic experience of actually being an\nactivist, said something like, \"well, just 'cause someone's conservative doesn't mean they're wrong.\" And I remember feeling kind\nof scandalized at some level of just being like, wow,\nisn't that the whole thing what we're saying is that\nthey're just kind of bad people with bad ideas? - You can just throw, oh,\nthat guy's a right winger, you can just throw that. - Boop, don't have to\nthink about you anymore. - Yeah, if you're popular enough, it can be kind of sticky\nand it's weird because- - Because it's effective, that's why it keeps on getting used. Essentially, it should have hit someone because I have a great liberal pedigree, everything from working at\nthe ACLU to doing refugee law in Eastern Europe. I was part of an environmental\nmentoring program for inner city high school kids in DC. I can defend myself as being on the left. But I hate doing that because\nthere's also part of me that's like, \"okay, so what?\" Like, are you really saying that if you can magically make me\nargue or convince yourself that I'm on the right, that you don't have to\nlisten to me anymore? And again, that's arguing like children. And the reason why this\nhas become so popular is because even among, or\nmaybe especially among elites, that it works so effectively as a perfect weapon that\nyou can use uncritically. If I can just prove you're on the right, I don't have to think about you. It's no wonder that suddenly\nyou start seeing people calling the ACLU right wing and calling the New York Times right wing because it's been such an effective way to delegitimize people as thinkers. Stephen Pinker, who's on\nour board of advisors, he refers to academia\nas being the left pole, that essentially it's a position\nfrom that point of view, everything looks to its right. It looks as if it's on the right. But once it becomes a\ntactic that we accept, and that's one of the reasons\nwhy I'm more on the left. But I think I'm left of center liberal. Rikki is more conservative libertarian. And initially I was kind of like, should I be really be writing something with someone who's more on the right? And I'm like, absolutely I should be. I have to actually live up to\nwhat I believe on this stuff because it's ridiculous that\nwe have this primitive idea that you can dismiss\nsomeone as soon as you claim rightly or wrongly that\nthey're on the right. - Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like you were\nrecently called right wing. FIRE, maybe you by association\nbecause of that debate. - Oh, the LA Times. - [Lex] The LA Times. - Oh fun, let's talk about the LA Times. - So yes, there's an\narticle, there's a debate. I can't wait to watch it 'cause I don't think it's\navailable yet to watch on video. You have to attend in person. I can't wait to see it. But FIRE was in part\nsupporting and then LA Times wrote a scathing article about... that everybody in the\ndebate was basically right, leaning right. - Okay, so much to unpack there. Bari Weiss has this great\nproject, the Free Press, I've been very impressed. It's covering stories\nthat a lot of the media right or left isn't willing to cover. And we hosted a debate with her and we wanted to make it as fun and controversial as possible. So FIRE and the, The Free\nPress hosted a debate. \"Did the sexual revolution fail?\" So the debate was really\nexciting, really fun. The side that said that sexual\nrevolution wasn't a failure. That Grimes and Sarah\nHaider were on one won. it it was nice meaty, thoughtful night and there was a review of it\nthat was just sort of scathing about the whole thing. And it included a line saying that FIRE, which claims to believe in free speech, but only defends\nviewpoints it agrees with. I can't believe that even\nmade it into the magazine 'cause it's not just\ncalling us 'cause of course, the implication was that we're\nright wing which we're not. Actually the staff leans\ndecidedly more to the left than to the right. But we also defend people\nall over the spectrum all the time. Like that's something\nthat even the most minimal Google search would've solved. So like we've been giving\nLA Times some heat on this because it's like, yeah, if you said, in my opinion they're right\nwing, we would've argued back, you know, saying, well here's\nthe following 50,000 examples of us not being, but when you actually\nmake the factual claim that we only defend opinions\nwe agree with, first of all, there's no way for us\nto agree with opinions because we actually have a\npolitically diverse staff who won't even agree on\nwhich opinions are good and what opinions we have. But yeah, at one time when\nsomeone did something like this and they were just being\na little bit flippant about kind of like free speech being fine, I did a 70 tweet long thread, just being like, \"Hey, do you\nreally think this is fine?\" I decided not to do that\non this particular one. But the nice thing about it\nis it demonstrated two parts of the book \"Canceling of the\nAmerican Mind\" if not more. One of them is dismissing someone 'cause they're conservative and because that was the implication. Don't have to listen to FIRE\n'cause they're conservative. But the other one is something,\na term that I invented specifically for the way\npeople argue on Twitter, which is hypocrisy projection. Hi, I'm a person who only caress about one\nside of the political fence and I think everyone else is a hypocrite. And by the way, I haven't done\nany actual research on this, but I assume everyone else is a hypocrite. And you see this happen all the time and this happens to FIRE a lot\nwhere someone will be like, where is FIRE on this\ncase? And we're like, we are literally quoted\nin the link you just sent but didn't actually read. Or it's like, where's FIRE on this? It's like, here's our lawsuit\nabout it from six months ago. So it's a favorite thing. And also John Stewart Daily\nShow like the whataboutism, and the kind of like\nidea that these people must be hypocrites is\nsomething that greatest comedy. But as far as actually a rhetorical tactic that will get you the truth, just assuming that your opponent or just accusing your opponent\nof always being a hypocrite is not a good tactic for truth. But by the way, it tends\nto always come from people who aren't actually consistent\non free speech themselves. - So hence the projection. But basically not doing the research about whether the person\nis or isn't a hypocrite and assuming others or a large\nfraction of others reading it will also not do the research. And therefore this kind of statement becomes a kind of truthiness\nwithout a grounding in actual reality.\n- Yeah. - It breaks down that barrier\nbetween what is and isn't true because if the mob says something is true, it takes too much effort to correct it. - And there are three ways\nI wanna respond to this, which is just giving example after example of times where we defended\npeople on both sides of every major issue. Basically every major issue, whether it's Israel Palestine,\nwhether it's terrorism, whether it's gay marriage,\nwe have been, abortion. We have defended both\nsides of that argument. The other part, and I call these the\norphans of the culture war. I really want to urge the media to start caring about free speech cases that actually don't\nhave a political valence that are actually just\nabout good old fashioned exercise of power against\nthe little guy or little girl or little group on campus or\noff campus for that matter 'cause these cases happen, a lot of our litigation\nare just little people, just regular people being\ntold that they can't protest, that they can't hold signs. And then the last part of the argument that I want people to\nreally get is like, yeah, and by the way, right wingers get in trouble too, and there are attacks from the left. And you should take those seriously too. You should care when\nRepublicans get in trouble, you should care when\nCalifornia has a DEI program that requires this,\nCalifornia community colleges has a DEI program, a policy that actually requires\neven chemistry professors to work in different DEI ideas from intersectionality to\nanti-racism into their classroom, into their syllabus, et cetera. This is a gross violation\nof economic freedom. It is as bad as it is to tell\nprofessors what they can't say like we fought and defeated in Florida. It's even worse to tell\nthem what they must say. That's downright totalitarian\nand we're suing against this. And what I'm saying is that,\nwhen you're dismissing someone for just being on the other\nside of the political fence, you are also kind of\nclaiming, making a claim that none of these cases matter as well. And I want people to care about censorship even if it's against people they hate. - Censorship is censorship. If we can take that\ntangent briefly with DEI, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. What is the good and what is\nthe harm of such programs? - DEI, I know people\nwho are DEI consultants. Actually I have a dear\nfriend who I love very much who does DEI, absolutely decent people. What they want to do is create bonds of\nunderstanding, friendship, compassion among people who are different. Unfortunately, the research on what a lot of DEI actually does is oftentimes the opposite of that. And I think that it's partially a problem with some of the ideology that comes from critical race theory, which is a real thing by the way. That informs a lot of DEI, that\nactually makes it something more likely to divide than unite. We talk about this in\n\"Coddling of the American Mind\" as the difference between common\nhumanity identity politics and common enemy identity politics. And I think that, I know some\nof the people that I know who do DEI, they really want it to be common\nhumanity identity politics. But some of the actual\nideological assumptions that are baked in can\nactually cause people to feel more alienated from each other. Now, when I started at FIRE, my first cases involved\n9/11 and it was bad. Professors were getting targeted, professors were losing their jobs for saying insensitive things about 9/11. And both from the right\nand the left actually in that case, actually sometimes\na lot more from the right. And it was really bad. And about five professors lost their jobs. That's bad. Five professors over a\nrelatively short period of time being fired for a political opinion. That's something that would get written up in any previous decades. We're now evaluating\nlike how many professors have been targeted for cancellation between 2014 and middle of\nthis year, July of 2023. We're at about, well over 1,000 attempts to get professors fired or punished, usually driven by students\nand administrators, often driven by professors\nunfortunately as well. About two thirds of those result in the professor\nbeing punished in some way. Everything from having their\narticle removed to suspension, et cetera. About one fifth of those result in professors being fired. So right now, it's almost 200, it's around 190 professors being fired. So I want to give some context here. The Red Scare is generally considered to have been from 1947 to 1957. It ended by the way, in '57\nwhen it finally became clear thanks to the First Amendment, that you couldn't actually fire\npeople for their ideologies. Prior to that, a lot of universities thought they could. This guy is a very\ndoctrinaire or communist, they can't be just persuaded,\nI'm gonna fire them. They thought they actually could do that. And it was only '57 when\nthe law was established. So like right now, these are\nhappening in an environment where freedom of speech, academic freedom are clearly protected at public colleges in the United States and we're still seeing\nthese kind of numbers. During the Red Scare, the biggest study that was\ndone of what was going on I think this came out in like '55 and the evaluation was that\nthere was about 62 professors fired for being communists and\nabout 90 something professors fired for political views overall. That usually is reported\nas being about 100. So 60, 90, 100 depending\non how you look at it, I think the number is actually higher. But that's only because of hindsight. Like what I mean by\nhindsight is we can look back and we actually find\nthere were more professors who were fired as time reveals. We're at 190 professors fired. And I still have to put\nup with people saying this isn't even happening. And I'm like, in the nine and a half years of cancel culture, 190 professors fired. In the 11 years of the Red Scare probably somewhere around\n100, maybe probably more. The number's gonna keep going up. But unlike during the Red Scare where people could clearly\ntell something was happening, the craziest thing about cancel culture is I'm still dealing with\npeople who are saying this isn't happening at all. And it hasn't been subtle on campus. And we know that's a wild\nunder count by the way, because when we surveyed professors, 17% of them said that\nthey had been threatened with investigation or\nactually investigated for what they taught,\nsaid or their research. And one third of them said that they were told by administrators not to take on controversial research. So like extrapolating that out, that's a huge number and the reason why\nyou're not going to hear about a lot of these cases is because there are so\nmany different conformity inducing mechanisms in the whole thing. And that's one of the reasons why the idea that you'd add something like\nrequiring a DEI statement to be hired or to get into a school under the current environment\nis so completely nuts. We have had a genuine\ncrisis of academic freedom over the last, particularly\nsince 2017 on campuses. We have very low viewpoint\ndiversity to begin with. And under these circumstances, administrators just start saying, you know what the problem is, we have too much heterogeneous thought. We're not homogeneous enough. We actually need... We need another political\nlitmus test, which is nuts. And that's what a DEI\nstatement effectively is 'cause there's no way to\nactually fill out a DEI statement without someone evaluating\nyou on your politics. It's crystal clear. We even did an experiment on this. Nate Honeycutt, he got something like\nalmost like 3,000 professors to participate evaluating\ndifferent kinds of DEI statements. And one was basically like the standard kind of identity politics,\nintersectionality one, one was about viewpoint diversity, one was about religious diversity and one was about socioeconomic diversity. And as far as where my heart really is, it's that we have too little\nsocioeconomic diversity, particularly in elite higher ed, but also in education period. So the experiment was, had large participation\nreally interestingly set up and it tried to model the way\na lot of these DEI policies were actually implemented. And one of the ways these\nhave been implemented and I think in some of\nthe California schools is that administrators go\nthrough the DEI statements before anyone else looks at them and then eliminates people off the top depending on how they feel\nabout their DEI statements. And the one on viewpoint diversity, I think like half of the\npeople who reviewed it would eliminate it right out. And I think it was basically the same for religious diversity. It was slightly better, like 40% for socioeconomic diversity. But that kills me. Like the idea that kind of like, yeah, that actually is the kind of\ndiversity that I think we need a great deal more of in higher education. It's not hostile to the\nother kinds by the way, but the idea that we need\nmore people from the bottom, of three quarters of American society, like in higher education, I think should be something\nwe could all get around. That the only one that really succeeded was the one that spouted back exactly the kind of ideology that they thought the readers would like. Which is like, okay, there's no way this couldn't\nbe a political litmus test. We've proved that it's\na political litmus test and still school after school is adding these to its application process to make schools still more\nideologically homogenous. - Why does that have a negative effect? Is it because it enforces\na kind of group think where people are afraid, start becoming afraid to sort\nof think and speak freely, liberally about whatever? - Well one, it selects\nfor people who tend to be, farther to the left in a situation where you already have people, a situation where universities\ndo lean decidedly that way. But it also establishes\nessentially a set of sacred ideas that if you're being quizzed on whether what you've done to advance anti-racism, how you've been conscious\nof intersectionality, it's unlikely that you'd\nactually get in if you said, \"by the way, I actually think\nthese are dubious concepts. I think they're thin. I think they're philosophically\nnot very defensible.\" Basically like if your position was, I actually actually reject these concepts as being over simple. You're not gonna get\nin and I think that... The person that I always think\nof that wasn't a right winger that would be like \"go to hell\" if you made him fill\none of these things out, it's Feynman. I feel like if you gave\none of these things to Richard Feynman, he'd be like, he would tear it to pieces. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And then not get the job. - Yeah, there's some element of it that creates this hard to pin down fear. So you said like the firing, the thing I wanted to say is, firing 100 people or 200 people, the point is even firing one\nperson, I've just seen it, it can create this quiet\nripple effect of fear. - Oh, of course. - That single firing of a faculty- - [Greg] Oh absolutely. - Has a ripple effect across\ntens of thousands of people, of educators, of who is hired, what kind of conversations are being had, what kind of textbooks are chosen, what kind of self censorship\nand different flavors of that is happening. It's hard to measure that. - Yeah I mean, when you\nask professors about, are they intimidated under\nthe current environment, the answer is yes. And particularly conservative professors, already reporting that\nthey're afraid for their jobs in a lot of different cases. - You have a lot of good\nstatistics in the book. Things like self-censorship. One provided with a\ndefinition of self-censorship, at least a quarter of students said they self-censor\nfairly often or very often during conversations with\nother students, with professors and during classroom discussions. 25%, 27% and 28% respectively. A quarter of students also\nsaid that they are more likely to self-censor on campus now\nat the time they were surveyed than they were when they\nfirst started college. So sort of colleges kind of instilling this\nidea of censorship, self-censorship. - [Greg] And back to the\nRed Scare comparison, and this is one of the interesting things about the data as well, is that that same study\nthat I was talking about, the most comprehensive\nstudy of the Red Scare, there was polling about\nwhether or not professors were self-censoring due to\nthe fear of the environment. And 9% of professors said\nthat they were self-censoring their research and what they were saying. 9% is really bad. That's almost a 10th of professors saying that they were actually, their speech was chilled. When we did this question for professors on our\nlatest faculty survey, when you factor together, we asked them are they\nself-censoring in their research, are they self-censoring in class, are they self-censoring online, et cetera. It was 90% of professors. So the idea that we're\nactually in an environment that is historic in terms of\nlike how scared people are actually of expressing\ncontroversial views, I think that it's the reason why we're gonna actually be\nstudying this in 50 years. The same way we studied the Red Scare. The idea that this isn't happening is we'll just be correctly\nviewed as insane. - So maybe we can just\ndiscuss the leaning, the current leaning of\nacademia towards the left which you describe in various\ndifferent perspectives. So one, there's a voter\nregistration ratio chart that you have by department,\nwhich I think is interesting. Can you explain this chart and can you explain what it shows? - [Greg] Yeah, when I\nstarted FIRE in 2001, I didn't take the viewpoint\ndiversity issue as seriously. I thought it was just\nsomething that right wingers complained about. But I really started to get what happens when you have a community\nwith low viewpoint diversity. And actually a lot of the research that I got most interested in was done in conjunction\nwith the great Cuss Sunstein who writes a lot about group polarization and the research on this is very strong, that essentially when you have groups with political diversity, and you can see this actually\nin judges for example, it tends to produce reliably\nmore moderate outcomes. Whereas groups that have\nlow political diversity tend to sort of spiral, spiral off in their own direction. And when you have a\nsuper majority of people from just one political perspective, that's a problem for\nthe production of ideas. It creates a situation where\nthere are sacred ideas. And when you look at\nsome of the departments, I think the estimate from the Crimson is that Harvard has 3% conservatives. But when you look at\ndifferent departments, there are elite departments that have literally no\nconservatives in them. And I think that's an unhealthy\nintellectual environment. The problem is definitely\nworse as you get more elite, we definitely see more\ncases of lefty professors getting canceled at less elite schools. It gets worse as you get\ndown from the elite schools. That's where a lot of\nthe one third of attempts to get professors punished\nthat are successful, do come from the right and largely from off-campus sources. And we spend a lot of\ntime talking about that in the book as well. It's something that I do\nthink is underappreciated, but when it comes to the\nlow viewpoint diversity, it works out kind of like\nyou'd expect to a degree. Economics is what? Four to one or something like that. It's not as bad. But then when you start getting\ninto some of the humanities, like there are departments\nthat there are literally none. - Is there a good why to\nwhy did the universities university faculty\nadministration move to the left? - Yeah. I don't love, and this is an argument that\nyou'll sometimes run into on the left, just the argument that\nwell people on the left are just smarter. And it's like, okay, it's interesting because\nat least the research as of 10 years ago was indicating that if you dig a little\nbit deeper into that, a lot of the people who do\nconsider themselves on the left tend to be a little bit more libertarian. Pinker wrote a fair amount about the idea that we're just smarter. It is not an opinion I'm at\nleast bit comfortable with. I do think that departments\ntake on momentum when they become a place\nwhere you're like, wow, it'd be really unpleasant for\nme to work in this department if I'm the token conservative. And I think that takes\non a life of its own. There are also departments\nwhere a lot of the ideologies kind of explicitly leftist. You look at education schools, a lot of the stuff that\nis actually left over from what is correctly\ncalled critical race theories is present. And you end up having that in\na number of the departments. And it would be very strange\nto be in many departments, a conservative social worker professor. I'm sure they exist, but there's a lot of pressure\nto shut up if you are. - So the process on the\nleft of cancellation, as you started to talk about with the perfect rhetorical fortress, the first step is dismiss a person if you can put a label\nof conservative on them, you can dismiss 'em in that way. What other efficient or what other effective\ndismissal mechanisms are there? - Yeah, we have a little bit\nof fun with demographic numbers and I run this by height and I remember him being kind of like, don't include the actual percentage. I'm like, no, we need to include the actual percentages 'cause people are really bad at estimating what the demographics of\nthe US actually looks like, both the right and the\nleft in different ways. So we put it in the\nnumbers and we talk about, being dismissed for being white or being dismissed for being straight or being dismissed for being male. And you can already dismiss\npeople for being conservative. And so we give examples in the book of these being used to dismiss people and oftentimes on topics not related to the fact that they're a male or whether or not they're a minority. And then we get to, I think it's like layer\nsix and we're like, surprise guess what? You're\ndown to 0.4% of the population and none of it mattered because if you have the wrong opinion, even if you're in that 0.4% of the most intersectional\nperson who ever lived and you have the wrong\nopinion, you're a heretic and you actually probably\nwill be hated even more. And the most interesting part of the research we did for this was just asking every\nprominent black conservative and moderate that we knew personally. Have you been told that\nyou're not really black for an opinion you had? Every single one of\nthem was like, oh yeah. And it's kind of funny\n'cause it's like oftentimes white lefties telling them that's like, oh, do you consider yourself black? John McWhorter talked\nabout having a reporter when he showed that he dissented from some of what he described\nas kind of like woke racism in his book \"Woke Ideas.\" The reporter actually is like, so do you consider yourself black? He's like, what? He was like, what, are you crazy? Of course I do. And Coleman Hughes had one\nof the best quotes on it. He said, \"I'm constantly being told\nthat the most important thing to how legitimate my opinion is, is whether or not I'm black. But then when I have a dissenting opinion, I get told I'm not really black.\" So, perfect. Like, there's no way to\nfalsify this argument. That investigation really struck me. - And you lay this out\nreally nicely in the book, that there is this process of\nsaying, are you conservative? Yes, you can dismiss the person. Are you white? Dismiss the person. Are you male? You can dismiss the person. There's these categories\nthat make it easier for you to dismiss a\nperson's ideas based on that. And like you said, you end\nup in that tiny percentage and you could still dismiss. - And it's not just dismiss. We talk about this from\na practical standpoint, the way the limitations on reality. And one of 'em is time and\na lot of cancel culture as cultural norms, as this\nway of winning arguments without winning arguments is\nabout running up the clock because by the time you\nget down to the bottom or actually even you get a couple of steps into the perfect rhetorical fortress and where has the time gone? You probably just give up trying to actually have the argument and you never get to the\nargument in the first place. - And all of these things are\npretty sticky on social media. - Social media practically invented the perfect rhetorical fortress. - So that each one of those\nstages has a virality to it. - [Greg] Yeah. - So it could stick and then it can get people really excited. - It allows you to feel\noutraged and superiority. - Yeah because of that, at the scale of the virality allows you to never get to the actual\ndiscussion of the point. So, but it's not just the left, it's the right also, the\nefficient rhetorical fortress. So something to be proud of on the right. It's more efficient. - [Greg] Yeah. - So you don't have to listen to liberals and anyone can be labeled a liberal if they have a wrong opinion. I've seen liberal and\nleft and leftist all used in the same kind of way. That's leftist nonsense. You don't have to listen to experts. Even conservative experts, if\nthey have the wrong opinion, you don't have to listen to journalists, even conservative journalists if they have the wrong opinion. And among the MAGA wing\nthere's a fourth proposition, there's a fourth provision. You don't need to listen to\nanyone who isn't pro-Trump. - Yeah, and we call it efficient because it eliminates a lot of people you probably should listen\nto at least sometimes, like we point out sometimes\nlike how cancel culture can interfere with faith and expertise. So we get kind of being a\nlittle suspicious of experts, but at the same time, if you follow that and\nyou follow it mechanically and I think everybody in the US probably has some older uncle\nwho exercises some of these. It is a really efficient way\nto sort of wall yourself off from the rest of the world and dismiss, at least some people you\nreally should be listening to. - The way you laid it out. It made me realize that we just take up so much of our\nbrain power with these things it's literally time- - We could be solving things. - And you get like, you kind of exhaust yourself\nthrough this process of being outraged based on these labels. And you never get to actually, there's almost not enough time for empathy for like looking at a person thinking, well maybe they're right 'cause you're so busy categorizing them. And it's fascinating. - What's the fun in empathy? And I mean, what's so\ninteresting about this is that so much societal energy seems to be spent on these nasty, primal desires where\nessentially a lot of it's like, please tell me who I'm allowed to hate. Where can I legitimately be cruel? Where can I actually exercise some aggression against somebody? And it seems to sometimes be just finding new justifications for that\nand it's an understandable, human failing that sometimes\ncan be used to defend justice, but again, it will never get\nyou anywhere near the truth. - One interesting case that you cover, about expertise is with COVID. - [Greg] Yeah. - So how did cancel culture come into play on the topic of COVID? - Yeah, I think that COVID was\na big blow to people's faith and expertise and cancel culture\nplayed a big role in that. I think one of the best examples of this is Jennifer Sey at Levi's.\nShe is a lovely woman. She was a vice president at Levi's. She talked about actually potentially to be the president of Levi's jeans. And she was a big advocate for kids. And when they started\nshutting down the schools, she started saying, this\nis going to be a disaster. This is going to hurt the poor and disadvantaged kids the most. We have to figure out a way\nto open the schools back up. And that was such a\nheretical point of view. And the typical kind of\ncancel culture wave took over because we had all sorts of\npetitions for her to be fired and that she needed to apologize\nand all this kind of stuff. And you know, she was offered I think like\na million dollar severance, which she wouldn't take 'cause\nshe wanted to tell the world what she thought about this and that she wanted to continue saying that she hadn't changed her mind. That this was a disaster for young people. And now that's kind of\nthe conventional wisdom and the research is quite clear that this was devastating to particularly disadvantaged youths. Like people understand\nthis now as being okay. She was probably right. But one of the really sad\naspects of cancel culture is people forget why you are canceled and they just know they hate you. There's this lingering kind of like, well I don't have to take\nthem seriously anymore. By the way, did you notice\nthey happened to be right on something very important? Now, one funny thing\nabout freedom of speech, freedom of speech wouldn't exist if you didn't also have the right to say things that were wrong because if you can't engage in ideaphoria, if you can't actually speculate, you'll never actually get\nto something that's right in the first place. But it's especially galling\nwhen people who were right were censored and never\nactually get the credit that they deserve. - Well this might be a good place to ask a little bit more about\nthe freedom of speech. And so you said that included\nin the freedom of speech is to say things that are wrong. What is your perspective on hate speech? - Hate speech is the best\nmarketing campaign for censorship and it came from academia\nof the 20th century. And that when I talked about\nthe anti-free speech movement, that was one of their first inventions. There was a lot of talk\nabout critical race theory and being against critical\nrace theory and FIRE will sue if you say that people can't\nadvocate for it or teach it or research it because you\ndo absolutely have the right to pursue it academically. However, every time someone mentions CRT, they should also say\nthe very first project of the people who founded CRT, Richard Delgado, Mary Metsuda, et cetera, was to create this new\ncategory of unprotected speech called hate speech. And to get it banned, the person who enabled\nthis drift of course was Herbert Marcuse in 1965 basically questioning\nwhether or not free speech should be a sacred value on the left. And he was on the losing\nside for a really long time. The liberals, the way I\ngrew up that was basically being pro-free speech was\nsynonymous with being a liberal, but that started to be\netched away on campus. And the way it was was with\nthe idea of hate speech that essentially, oh, but we can designate\nparticularly bad speech as not protected and\nwho's gonna enforce it? Who's gonna decide what\nhate speech actually is? Well it's usually\noverwhelmingly can only happen in an environment of really\nlow viewpoint diversity because you have to actually agree on what the most hateful\nand wrong things are. And there's a bedrock principle. it's referred to this in a\ngreat case about flag burning in the First Amendment that I think all the\nworld could benefit from. You can't ban speech just\n'cause it's offensive, it's too subjective. It's one of the reasons\nwhy these kind of codes have been more happily\nadopted in places like Europe where they have a sense that\nthere's like a modal German or a modal Englishman. And I think this is offensive\nand therefore I can say that this is wrong. In a more multicultural, in a\ngenuinely more diverse country that's never actually\nhad an honest thought that there is a single kind of American. There's never been, like we\nhad the idea of Uncle Sam, but that was always kind of a joke. Boston always knew it wasn't,\nRichmond always knew it wasn't Georgia always knew it\nwasn't, you know, Alaska. Like we've always been a hodgepodge and we get in a society that diverse that you can't ban things simply 'cause they're offensive. And that's one of the reasons why hate speech is not an\nunprotected category of speech. And I go further, my\ntheory on freedom of speech is slightly different than most other constitutional lawyers. And I think that's partially\nbecause some of the ways, some of these theories, although a lot of them are\nreally good, are inadequate, they're not expansive enough. And I sometimes call my theory\nthe pure informational theory of freedom of speech or\nsometimes when I wanna be fancy the lab and the looking glass theory. And it's most important tenet is that if the goal is the project\nof human knowledge, which is to know the world as it is, you cannot know the world as it is without knowing what people really think and what people really think is an incredibly important fact to know. So every time you're actually\nsaying \"you can't say that\" you're actually depriving\nyourself of the knowledge of what people really think. You're causing what Timur Kuran who's on our board of advisor, it's called preference falsification. You end up with an inaccurate\npicture of the world. Which by the way, in a lot of cases, because there are activists who want to restrict more speech, they actually tend to think\nthat people are more prejudice than they might be. And actually these kind of restrictions, there was a book called \"Racial Paranoia\" that came out about 15 years ago that was making the\npoint that the imposition of some of these codes\ncan sometimes make people think that the only thing holding you back from being a raging\nracist are these codes. So it must be really, really bad. It can actually make\nall these things worse. And one, which we talk about in the book, one very real practical\nway it makes things worse is when you censor people, it\ndoesn't change their opinion, it just encourages them to\nnot share it with people who will get them in trouble. So it leads them to talk to people who they already agree with and group polarization takes off. So we have some interesting\ndata in the book about how driving people\noff of Twitter, for example, in 2017 and then again I think in 2020, driving people to gab led\nto greater radicalization among those people. It's a very predictable force. Censorship doesn't actually\nchange people's minds and it pushes them in\ndirections that actually by very solid research will actually make them more radicalized. So yeah, I think that the\nattempt to ban hate speech, it doesn't really protect us from it, but it gives the government\nsuch a vast weapon to use against us that we will\nregret giving them. - Is there a ways to sort of, to look at extreme cases to\ntest this idea out a little bit? So if you look on campus, what's your view about allowing say, white supremacists on\ncampus to do speeches? KKK. - I think you should be able\nto study what people think and I think it's important\nthat we actually do. So I think that, let's\ntake for example QAnon. Yeah, QAnon is wrong, but\nwhere did it come from? Why did they think that?\nWhat's the motivation? Who taught them it? Who\ncame up with these ideas? This is important to understand history, it's important to understand\nmodern American politics. And so if you put your scholar hat on, and which you should be\ncurious about kind of everyone, about where they're coming from. Daryl Davis, who I'm sure\nyou're familiar with, part of his goal was just\nsimply to get to know where people were coming from. And in the process he\nactually deradicalized a number of clans members when they actually realized\nthat this black man who would befriended them\nactually was compassionate, was a decent person. They realized all their\npreconceptions were wrong. So it can have a deradicalizing\nfactor by the way, but even when it doesn't, it's still really important to know what the bad people in your society think. Honestly, in some ways\nit's for your own safety, it's probably more important to know what the bad people in your\nsociety actually think. - I personally, I don't know\nwhat you think about that, but I personally think\nthat freedom of speech in cases like that, like KKK on campus can do more harm in the short term, but much more benefit in the long term 'cause you can sometimes argue for like, this is going to hurt in the short term. But I mean, Harvey said this, like consider the alternative.\n- Yeah. - Because you've just kind\nof made the case for like, this potentially would be a good thing even in the short term\nand it often is I think especially in a stable society like ours with a strong middle class,\nall these kinds of things where people have like the comforts to reason through things. But you know, to me it's like, even if it hurts in the short term, even if it does create more\nhate in the short term, the freedom of speech has\nthis really beneficial thing, which is it helps you\nmove towards the truth, the entirety of society towards a deeper, more accurate understanding\nof life on earth, of society, of how people function,\nof ethics, of metaphysics, of everything. And that in the long\nterm is a huge benefit. It gets rid of the Nazis in the long term, even if it adds to the number\nof Nazis in the short term. - Yeah. Well, and meanwhile, just for, and the reality check part of this is people always bring up, what\nabout the Klan on campus? I'm like, they're never invited. I haven't seen a case\nwhere they've been invited. Usually the Klan argument gets thrown out when people are trying to excuse and that's why we\nshouted down Ben Shapiro. And that's why you can't\nhave Bill Maher on campus. And it's like, okay. And it's a little bit of\nthat whataboutism again about being like, well that thing over there is terrible and therefore this\ncomedian shouldn't come. - So I do have a question\nmaybe by way of advice - Sure. - You know, interviewing\nfolks and seeing this, like a podcast has a platform\nin deciding who to talk to or not, that's something I\nhave to come face to face with on occasion. My natural inclination\nbefore I started the podcast was I would talk to anyone and including people which\nI'm still interested in, who are current members of the KKK. And to me there's a responsibility\nto do that with skill. And that responsibility has been weighing\nheavier and heavier on me because you realize how\nmuch skill it actually takes because you have to know,\nto understand so much because I've come to understand that the devil is always\ngoing to be charismatic. The devil's not gonna look like the devil. And so you have to realize, you can't always come to the\ntable with a deep compassion for another human being. You have to have like 90% compassion and another 90% deep historical knowledge about the context of the battles around this particular issue. And that takes just a\nhuge amount of effort. But I don't know if there's\nthoughts you have about this, how to handle speech in\na way without censoring bringing it to the surface, but in a way that creates\nmore love in the world. - I remember Steve Bannon got disinvited from the New Yorker festival\nand Jim Carrey freaked out and all sorts of other people freaked out and they got disinvited and I got invited to speak\non Serash about this. And I was saying like, listen, you don't have people to your conference because you agree with them. Like we have to get out of this idea because they were trying\nto make it sound like that's an endorsement of Steve Bannon. Like that's nonsense. Like if you actually look at the opinions of all the people who are there, you can't possibly\nendorse all the opinions that all these other people\nwho are gonna be there actually have. And in the process of\nmaking that argument, and also of course, the very classic, it's very valuable to know\nwhat Steve Bannon thinks. You should be curious about that and I remember someone\narguing back saying, well, would you want\nsomeone to interview Jihadi? And I'm like, because at the moment, like\nit was at the time when ISIS was really going for it. And I was like, would you not want to go to a talk where someone was trying to figure out what makes some of these people tick? But that changes your framing\nthat essentially it's like no, it's curiosity. is the cure\nfor a lot of this stuff and we need a great deal more curiosity and a lot less unwarranted certainty. - And there's a question of like, how do you conduct such conversations? - [Greg] Sure. - And I feel deeply underqualified. - Who do you think is\nespecially good at that? - I feel like documentary filmmakers usually do a much better job. And the best job is usually\ndone by biographers. So the more time you give\nto a particular conversation like really deep thought\nand historical context and studying the people, how they think, looking at all different perspectives. Looking at the psychology\nof the person, upbringing, their parents, their\ngrandparents, all of this. The more time you spend with that, the better the quality\nof the conversation is because you get to understand, you get to really\nempathize with the person, with the people he or she represents and you get to see the common humanity. All of this. Interviewers often don't do that work. - [Greg] Yeah. - So like the best stuff\nI've seen is interviews that are part of a documentary. But even now, documentaries are like, there's a huge incentive to\ndo as quickly as possible. There's not an incentive\nto really spend time with the person. - There's a great new\ndocumentary about Floyd Abrams that I really recommend. We did a documentary about Ira\nGlasser called \"Mighty Ira\" which was my video team and my protege, Nico Purino and Chris Malby\nand Aaron Reese put it together and it just follows the life\nand times of Ira Glasser, the former head of the ACLU. - If you could just linger on that, that's a fascinating story. - [Greg] Oh, yeah.\n- Who's Ira? - Ira's amazing. Ira, he wasn't a lawyer. He started working at the NYCLU, in the New York Civil\nLiberties Union back in I think the sixties. I think Robert Kennedy recommended that he go in that direction and he became the president\nof the ACLU right at the time that they were suffering\nfrom defending the Nazis at Skokie and Nico and Aaron\nand Chris put together this and they'd never done a documentary before and it came out so, so well, and it tells the story\nof the Nazis in Skokie. It tells the story of the case around it, it tells the story of the ACLU at the time and what a great leader Ira Glasser was. And one of the things that's so great is like when you get to\nsee the Nazis in Skokie, they come off like the idiots\nthat you would expect them to. There's a moment when the\nrally's not going very well and the leader gets flustered and it almost seems like\nhe's gonna like shout out kind of like, \"you're making\nthis Nazi rally into a mockery\" so it showed how actually allowing the Nazis to speak at Skokie kind of took the wind out of their sails. Like the whole movement,\neverybody was kind of, it all kind of dissolved after that because they looked like\nracist fools that they were, even \"Blues Brothers\"\nmade jokes about them. And it didn't turn into the disaster that people thought it was going to be just by letting them speak. And Ira Glassier. Okay, so he has this wonderful story about how Jackie Robinson\njoined the Brooklyn Dodgers and how there was a moment\nwhen it was seeing someone, an African American\nliterally on their team and how that really got 'em excited about the cause of racial equality and that became a big\npart of what his life was. And I just think of that\nas such a great metaphor is expanding your circle and seeing more people as being\nquite literally on your team is the solution to so\nmany of these problems. And I worry that one of the\nthings that is absolutely just a fact of life in America is like we do see each other more as enemy camps as opposed to people on the same team. And that was actually\nsomething in the early days, like me and Will Creeley, the legal director of FIRE\nwrote about the forthcoming free speech challenges of\neveryone being on Facebook. And one thing that I was hoping was that as more people were\nexposing more of their lives, we had realized a lot of these\nthings we knew intellectually like kids go to the bar and\nget drunk and do stupid things. That when we started seeing the evidence of them doing stupid things that we might be shocked at first, but then eventually get more\nsophisticated and be like, well, come on. People are like that. That never actually\nreally seemed to happen. That I don't think, I think that there are plenty of things we know about human nature and we know about dumb things people say, and we've made it into an environment where there's just someone out there waiting to be kind of like, oh, remember that dumb thing\nyou said when we were 14. Well I'm gonna make sure that you don't get into your\ndream school because of that. - That's offense archeology. - [Greg] That's not my term though. - Oh, okay.\n- [Greg] It's a great term. - Well that's a great term.\nWe steal from the best. Digging through someone's past comments to find a speech that hasn't aged well. - And that one's tactical, like that one isn't just\nsomeone not being empathetic. They're like, I'm gonna\npunish you for this and that's one of the\nreasons why I got depressed writing this book because there's already\npeople who don't love me because of \"Coddling of the American Mind\" usually based on a misunderstanding\nof what we actually said in \"Coddling of the American\nMind\" but nonetheless, but on this one, like I'm calling out\npeople for being very cruel in a lot of cases, but one thing that was really scary about studying a lot of these cases is that once you have\nthat target on your back, what they're gonna try to cancel\nyou for could be anything. They might go back into your old books, find something that you said in 1995, do something where essentially it looks like it's this\nentire other thing, but really what's going on is\nthey didn't like your opinion, they didn't like your\npoint of view on something and they're gonna find\na way that from now on anytime your name comes up, it's like, oh, remember this\nthing I didn't like about 'em. And it's, again, it's cruel. It doesn't get you anywhere\ncloser to the truth but it is a little scary\nto stick your neck out. - Okay, in terms of solutions. I'm gonna ask you a few things. So one, parenting. - Yeah, five and seven year old. - So I'm sure you've\nfigured it all out then. - Oh God, no. - From a free speech perspective. - [Greg] Yeah. - From a free speech culture perspective, how to be a good parent. - Yeah. I think the first quality\nyou should be cultivating in your children if you want\nto have a free speech culture is curiosity and an\nawareness of the vastness that will always be unknown. And getting my kids excited\nabout the idea that's like, we're gonna spend our whole\nlives learning about stuff and it's fast and exciting and endless and we'll never make a big dent in it, but the journey will be amazing, but only fools think they know everything. And sometimes dangerous fools at that. So giving the sense of\nintellectual humility early on being also, saying things\nthat actually do sound kind of old fashioned. I\nsay things to my kids like, \"listen, if you enjoy study and work, both things that I very\nmuch enjoy, I do for fun, your life is going to feel great and it's going to feel easy.\" So some of those old fashioned virtues are things I try to preach. Counterintuitive stuff\nlike outdoor time playing, having time that are not\nintermediated experiences is really important. And little things. Like I talk about in the book about when my kids are\nwatching something that's scary and I'm not talking\nabout like zombie movies, I'm talking about like a cartoon that has kind of a scary moment and saying that they\nwant to turn the TV off. And I talk to them and I say, \"listen, I'm gonna sit next to you and\nwe're gonna finish this show and I want you to tell me what you think of this afterwards.\" And I sat next to my sons\nand by the end of it, every single time when I asked them, \"was that as scary as you\nthought it was gonna be?\" And they was like, \"no\ndaddy, that was fine.\" And I'm like, \"that's one of\nthe great lessons in life. The fear that you don't go through becomes much bigger in your head than actually simply facing it.\" That's one of the reason\nwhy I'm fighting back against this culture. I'd love for all of our\nkids to be able to grow up in an environment where\npeople give you grace and accept the fact that sometimes people are gonna say\nthings that piss you off. Take seriously the\npossibility they may be wrong and be curious. - Well I have hope that\nthe thing you mentioned, which is because so much\nof young people's stuff is on the internet that they're going to\ngive each other a break 'cause then everybody's cancel worthy. - Generation Z hates\ncancel culture the most. And that's another reason\nwhy it's like people still claiming this is even happening. It's kind of like, no,\nyou actually can ask, kids what they think of cancel\nculture and they hate it. - Yeah. Well I kind of think of them\nas like the immune system that's like, that's the\nculture waking up to like, no, this is not a good thing. - I am glad though. I mean, I'm one of those kids who, is really glad that I was a\nlittle kid in the eighties and a teenager in the nineties because having everything\npotentially online, it's not an upbringing I envy. - Well because you can also\ndo the absolutest free speech. I like leaning into it where I hope for a future where a lot of our insecurities, flaws, everything's out there. And to be raw, honest with it, I think that leads to a better world 'cause the flaws are beautiful. I mean, the flaws is the basic ingredients of human connection. - Robert Wright, he\nwrote a book on Buddhism and I talked about trying\nto use social media from a Buddhist perspective\nand like as if you're- As if it's the collective\nunconscious meditating and seeing those little like angry bits that are trying to cancel\nyou or get you to shut up. And just kind of like\nletting them go the same way you're supposed to watch your\nthoughts kind of trail off. - I would love to see\nthat, like visualized, whatever the drama going on, just seeing the sea of it, of the collective consciousness\njust processing this and having a little like panic attack and just kind of like breathing it in. - Looking at the little\nsort of hateful angry voices kind of pop up and be\nlike, okay, there you are. And I'm still focused on that thing because that is one of\nthe things is okay, yeah, actually this is probably late in the game to be giving my grand\ntheory on this stuff. (Lex laughs) - Never too late. - So what I was studying in law school, when I ran out of First Amendment classes, I decided to study censorship\nduring the Tudor Dynasty because that's where we get\nour ideas of prior restraint that come from the licensing\nof the printing press, which was something that Henry\nVIII was the first to do. Where basically the idea was that if you can't print\nanything in England, unless it's with these, your\nMajesty approved printers, it will prevent heretical work and anti-Henry VIII stuff from coming out. Pretty, pretty, pretty,\npretty, pretty efficient idea if nothing else. And I always, so he started getting angry at the printing press around 1521 and then passed something\nthat required prints to be along with parliament in 1538. And I always think of that as\nkind of like where we are now because back then we had the\noriginal disruptive technology, writing was probably that. But the next one, which\nwas the printing press, which was absolutely calamitous. And I say calamitous on purpose\nbecause in the short term the witch hunts went up like crazy because the printing press\nallowed you to get that manual on how to find witches that\nthe religious wars went crazy. It led to all sorts of\ndistress, misinformation, nastiness. And Henry VIII was trying\nto put the genie back in the bottle. You know, he was kind of like, I want to use this for good. Like I feel like it could be used, but he was in an unavoidable\nperiod of epistemic anarchy. There's nothing you can do to make the period after\nthe printing press came out to be a non-disruptive, non-crazy period other than like absolute totalitarianism and destroy all the print presses, which simply was not possible in Europe. So I feel like that's kind\nof like where we are now. That disruption came from adding, I think several million people\nto the European conversation and then eventually the\nglobal conversation. But eventually it became the\nbest tool for disconfirmation for getting rid of falsity,\nfor spotting bad ideas. And it's the benefits, the long-term benefits\nof the printing press are incalculably great. And that's what gives me some\noptimism for where we are now with social media 'cause we are in that\nunavoidably anarchical period. And I do worry that there are attempts\nin states to pass things to try to put the genie\nback in the bottle. Like if we ban TikTok or\nwe say that nobody under 18 can be on the internet unless\nthey have parental permission. We're going at something that\nno amount of sort of top-down is going to be able to fix it. We have to culturally\nadapt to the fact of it in ways that make us wiser that actually and allow it potentially\nto be that wonderful engine for disconfirmation that we're\nnowhere near yet, by the way. But think about it, additional\nmillions of eyes on problems, thanks to the printing press helped create the scientific\nrevolution, the enlightenment, the discovery, ignorance. We now have added billions\nof eyes and voices to solving problems and we're using them for\ncat videos and canceling. - But those are just the early\ndays of the printing press. - Exactly. - It all starts with the\ncats and the canceling. Is there something about X, about Twitter, which is perhaps the most\nenergetic source of cats and canceling. - It seems like the collective\nunconscious of the species. I mean like, it's one of these things\nwhere the tendency to want to see patterns in history sometimes can limit the actual\nbatshit crazy experience of what history actually is because yes, we have these\nnice comforting ideas that it's gonna be like last time, we don't know, it hasn't happened yet. And I think how unusual Twitter is because I think of it as like the... Because people talk about\nwriting and mass communications and as being expanding the\nsize of our collective brain, but now we're kind of looking\nat our collective brain in real time and it's filled\njust like our own brains with all sorts of like little\ncrazy things that pop up and appear like virtual particles\nkind of all over the place of people reacting in real time to things. There's never been anything\neven vaguely like it. And it can be at its worst, awful to see. At its best sometimes seeing people like just getting euphoric\nover something going on and cracking absolutely\nbrilliant immediate jokes. At the same time, it can\neven be a joyful experience. I feel like, and I live in a neighborhood now on X where I mostly deal\nwith people that I think are actually thoughtful,\neven if I disagree with 'em and it's not such a bad experience. I occasionally run into\nthose other sort of what I call neighborhoods on X, where it's just all\ncanceling, all nastiness and it's always kind of an\nunpleasant visit to those places. I'm not saying the whole thing needs to be like my experience, but I do think that the reason why people keep on coming back to it is it reveals raw aspects of humanity that sometimes we prefer\nto pretend don't exist. - Yeah but also, it's\ntotally new, like you said. It's just the virality, the\nspeed, the news travels, the opinions travel that the\nbattle over ideas travels. - The battle over information too. - Yeah, of what is true\nand not, lies travel. The old Mark Twain thing\npretty fast on the thing. And then it changes your understanding of how to interpret information. - It can also stress you out to no end. Remember to get off it sometimes. The stats are pretty bad on\nmental health with young people. And I'm definitely in the\ncamp of people who think that social media is part of that. I understand the debate, but I'm pretty persuaded\nthat one of the things that it hasn't been\ngreat for mental health, I mean of people is just\nconstantly being exposed. - Yeah, absolutely. I think it's possible\nto create social media that makes a huge amount of\nmoney, makes people happy. To me, like it's possible\nto align the incentives. So in terms of, yeah, making teenagers, making every stage of life, giving you long-term\nfulfillment and happiness with your physical existence\noutside of social media and on social media. Helping you grow as a human being, helping challenge you\njust in the right amount and just the right amount of cat videos, whatever gives this full\nrich human experience. I think it's just a\nmachine learning problem. It's like, it's not easy... - [Greg] Interesting. - To create a feed. So the easiest feed you could do is like maximize engagement. - [Greg] Yeah. - But that's just like\na really dumb algorithm. It's like for the algorithm\nto learn enough about you to understand what will\nmake you truly happy as a human being to grow long term, that's just a very\ndifficult problem to solve. - Have you ever watched \"Fleabag?\" It's absolutely brilliant. A British show and it sets you up. One of the reasons why\nlike people love it so much is it sets you up that you're\nwatching like a raunchy British \"Sex in the City\"\nexcept the main character is the most promiscuous one. And it's like okay. And you kind of roll\nyour eyes a little bit and it's kind of funny\nand it's kind of cute and kind of spicy. And then you realize that the person is actually kind of suffering\nand having a hard time and it gets deeper and\ndeeper as the show goes on. And she will do these incredible speeches about tell me what to do. Like I know there's experts out there, I know there's knowledge out there. I know there's an optimal\nway to live my life, so why can't someone\njust tell me what to do? And it's this wonderfully like, accurate I think aspect of human desire that what if something\ncould actually tell me the optimal way to go 'cause I think there is a desire to give up some amount of your\nown freedom and discretion in order to be told to do\nthe optimally right thing. But that path scares me to death. - Yeah, but see the way you phrased it, that scares me too. So there's several things. One, you could be constantly\ndistracted in a TikTok way by things that keep you engaged. So removing that and giving you a bunch\nof options constantly and learning from long-term what results in your\nactual long-term happiness. So like which amounts of\nchallenging ideas are good for you. For somebody like me.\n- Four. Just four. - But there is a number\nlike that for you, Greg. For me, that number is pretty high. I love debate. I love the feeling of like realizing, holy shit, I've been wrong. - Yes! - But like, I would love for the algorithm to know that about me and to help me, but always giving me options if I want to descend into\nCat videos and so on. - But the educational aspect of it. - [Lex] Yes, educational, yes. - Like the idea of kind of\nlike both going the speed that you need to and\nrunning as fast as you can. - Yeah. I mean there's the whole flow thing. I just feel YouTube\nrecommendation for better or worse if used correctly, it feels like it does a pretty good job whenever I just refuse to click on stuff that's just dopamine based and click on only educational things, the recommendation it\nprovides are really damn good. So I feel like it's a solvable problem, at least in the space of\neducation, of challenging yourself but also expanding your realm of knowledge and all this kind of stuff. - And I'm definitely more in the, we're in an inescapably anarchical period and require big cultural adjustments and there's no way that this isn't gonna be\na difficult transition. - Is there any specific\nlittle or big things that you'd like to see X do, Twitter do? - I have lots of thoughts on that. With the printing press,\nan extra millions of eyes on any problem can tear\ndown any institution, any person or any idea and\nthat's good in some ways 'cause a lot of medieval\ninstitutions needed to be torn down and some people did too. And a lot of ideas needed to be torn down. Same thing is true now. An extra billions of eyes on every problem can tear down any person,\nidea or institution. And some, again, some of those things\nneeded to be torn down, but it can't build yet. We are not at the stage\nthat can build yet. But it has shown us how\nthin our knowledge was. It's one of the reasons\nwhy we're also aware of the replication crisis. It's one of the reasons\nwhy we're also aware of how kind of shoddy our research is. How much our expert class\nis arrogant in many cases. But people don't wanna live in a world where they don't have\npeople that they respect and they can look at. And I think what's happening possibly now, but will continue to happen is people are gonna establish themselves as being high integrity. That they will always be honest. I think you are establishing yourself as someone who is high integrity, where they can trust that person. FIRE wants to be the institution\nthat people can come to. It's like if it's free speech,\nwe will defend it, period. And I think that people\nneed to have authorities that they can actually trust. And I think that if you\nactually had a stream that maybe people can watch in action but not flood with stupid\ncancel culture stuff or dumb cat memes, where it is actually a serious discussion, bounded around rules. No perfect rhetorical fortress, no efficient rhetorical fortress, none of the the BS ways we debate. I think you could start to\nactually create something that could actually be a major improvement in the speed with which we\ncome up with new better ideas and establish and separate\ntruth from falsity. - Yeah, if it's done well, it can inspire a large number of people to become higher and higher integrity and it can create integrity\nas a value to strive for. - [Greg] Yeah. - And like, there's been\nprojects throughout the internet that have done incredible job of that, but have been also very flawed. Like Wikipedia is an example\nof a big leap forward in doing that. - [Greg] It's pretty damn impressive. What's your overall take? I mean, I'm mostly impressed. - So there's a few really powerful ideas for the people who edit Wikipedia. One of which is each editor\nkind of for themselves declares, I'm into politics and I really kind of\nam a left-leaning guy, so I really shouldn't be\nediting political articles 'cause I have bias. - [Greg] Oh, that's great. - They declare their biases\nand they often do a good job of actually declaring the\nbiases, but they'll still, like, they'll find a way to justify themselves. Like something will piss them off and they want to correct it 'cause they love correcting\nuntruth into truth, but the perspective of what is true or not is affected by their bias. - [Greg] Truth is hard to know. - And it is true that there\nis a left-leaning bias on the editors of Wikipedia. So for that, what happens is on articles,\nwhich I mostly appreciate that don't have a\npolitical aspect to them, scientific articles or technical articles, they can be really strong, even history just describing\nthe facts of history that don't have a subjective element. Strong. Also just using my own brain, I can kind of filter out if it's something about January\n6th or something like this, I know I'm going to be like, I'm not, whatever's going on here,\nI'm gonna kind of read it. But most I'm gonna look to other sources. I'm gonna look to a bunch of\ndifferent perspectives on it. It's going to be very tense. There's probably going\nto be some kind of bias, maybe some wording will be such, which is where Wikipedia does its thing. The way they word stuff will\nbe biased, the choice of words. But the Wikipedia editors\nthemselves are so self-reflective. They literally have articles\ndescribing these very effects of how you can use words to inject bias in all the ways that you talk about it. - [Greg] That's healthier\nthan most environments. - It's incredibly healthy, but\nI think you could do better. One of the big flaws of Wikipedia to me that community notes on X does better is the accessibility\nof becoming an editor. It's difficult to become an editor and it's not as visible\nthe process of editing. So I would love, like you said, a stream for everyone to be able\nto observe this debate between people with integrity of when they discuss\nthings like January 6th, of very controversial topics to just see how the\nprocess of the debate goes as opposed to being hidden in the shadows, which it currently is in Wikipedia. You can access that. It's just hard to access and I've also seen how they\nwill use certain articles like on certain people, like articles about people\nI've learned to trust less and less because they\nliterally will use those to make personal attacks. And this is something you write about, they'll use descriptions\nof different controversies to paint a picture of a person that doesn't, to me at least, feel like an accurate\nrepresentation of the person. And it's like writing an\narticle about Einstein, mentioning something\nabout theory of relativity and then saying that he\nwas a womanizer and abuser and like controversy, you know? Yeah, he is fine man also, you know, they're not exactly the perfect\nhuman in terms of women, but like there's other\naspects to this human and to capture that human properly, there's a certain way to do it. I think Wikipedia will often lean, they really try to be\nself-reflective and try to stop this, but they will lean into the\ndrama if it matches the bias. But again, much better than the world, I believe is much better\nbecause Wikipedia exists. But now that we're in\nthese adolescent stages, we're growing and trying to come up with different technologies,\nthe idea of a stream is really, really interesting because you get more and more\npeople into this discourse that where the value is\nlet's try to get the truth. - Yeah. And that basically, you know, you get little cards for\nnope wrong, nope wrong. - And the different rhetorical techniques that are being used to\navoid actually discussing. - Yeah. And I think I actually can\nmake it a little bit fun by getting a limited number of them. You know, it's kind of like you\nget three whataboutism cards - So gamifying the whole thing? Absolutely. - [Greg] Yeah. - Let me ask you about, so you mentioned going\ninto some difficult moments in your life.\n- [Greg] Sure. - What has been your\nexperience with depression? What has been your\nexperience getting out of it, overcoming it? - Yeah, I mean the whole\nthing, the whole journey, with \"Coddling of the\nAmerican Mind\" began with me at the Belmont Psychiatric\nfacility in Philadelphia back in 2007. I had called 911 in a moment of clarity because I'd gone to the hardware store to make sure that when I\nkilled myself, that it stuck. I wanted to make sure\nthat I had my head wrapped and everything. So like, if all the drugs I was\nplanning to take didn't work that I wouldn't be able\nto claw my way out. It'd been a really rough year. And I always had issues with depression, but they were getting worse. And frankly, one of the reasons why\nthis cancel culture stuff is so important to me is that the thing that I\ndidn't emphasize as much in \"Coddling of the American\nMind\" which by the way, that description that I give\nof trying to kill myself was the first time I'd\never written it down. Nobody in my family was\naware of it being like that. My wife had never seen it. And basically the only way\nI was able to write that was by doing, you know how you\ncan kind of trick yourself? And I was like, I'm\ngoing to convince myself that this is just between\nme and my computer and nobody will see it. And it's probably now\nthe most public thing I've ever written. But what I didn't emphasize in that was how much the culture war played into how depressed I got because I was originally\nthe legal director of FIRE, then I became president of FIRE in 2005, moved to Philadelphia\nwhere I get depressed and, I don't have family there. There's something about the town. They don't seem to like me very much. But the main thing was\nbeing in the culture world all the time. There was a girl that I\nwas dating, I remember, she didn't seem to really\napprove of what I did. And a lot of people didn't\nreally seem to, and meanwhile, like I was defending people\non the left all the time, and they'd be like, oh, that's good that you're\ndefending someone on the left. But they still would never forgive me for defending someone on the right and I remember saying\nat one point, I'm like, listen, I'm a true believer in this stuff. I'm willing to defend Nazis. I'm certainly willing\nto defend Republicans. And she actually said, I think\nRepublicans might be worse. And that relationship didn't go very well. And then I've nearly gotten\nfistfights a couple of times with people on the right because they found out I\ndefended people who crack jokes about 9/11. Like, this happened more than once. And by that time I'm in my twenties, I'm not fist fighting again. But yeah, it was always like that. You see how hypocritical people can be, you can see how friends can turn on you if they don't like your politics. So I got a early preview of this, of what the culture we were heading into by being the president of\nFIRE and it was exhausting. And that was one of the main\nthings that led me to be, suicidally depressed. At the Belmont Center, if you told me that that\nwould be the beginning of a new and better life for me, I would've laughed if I could have. You can tell I'm okay\nif I'm still laughing. And I wasn't laughing at that point. So I got a doctor and I started doing\ncognitive behavioral therapy. I started having all\nthese voices in my head that were catastrophizing and it gave overgeneralization\nand fortune telling, mind reading, all of these things that they teach you not to do. And what you do in CBT is essentially something makes you upset\nand then you just write down what the thought was and something minor could\nhappen and your response was, \"well the date didn't seem to go very well and that's because I'm\nbroken and will die alone.\" And you're like, okay, okay, okay. What are the following? That's catastrophizing. That's mind reading,\nthat's fortune telling. That's all this stuff. And you have to do this\nseveral times a day forever. I actually need to brush\nup on it at the moment. And it slowly over time, voices in my head that\nhave been saying horrible, horrible internal talk, it just didn't sound as convincing anymore which was really a kind\nof like subtle effect. Like it was just kind of like, oh wait, I don't buy that I'm broken. Like, that doesn't sound true. That doesn't sound like truth from God like it used to. And nine months after I was\nplanning to kill myself, I was probably happier\nthan I'd been in a decade. And that was one of the things that the CBT is what led me to notice this in my own work, that\nit felt like administrators were kind of selling\ncognitive distortions, but students weren't buying yet. And then when I started noticing\nthat they seemed to come in actually already believing\nin a lot of this stuff, that it would be very dangerous. And that led to \"Coddling\nof the American Mind\" and all that stuff. But the thing that was rough about writing \"The Canceling\nof the American Mind\" and I've mentioned this\nalready a couple of times. I got really depressed this past year because I was studying. There's a friend in\nthere that I talked about who killed himself after being canceled. I talked to him a week\nbefore he killed himself. And I hadn't actually checked in with him because he seemed so confident. I thought he would be totally fine 'cause he had an insensitive\ntweet in June of 2020 and got forced out in a way that didn't actually sound as bad as a lot of the other professors. He actually at least\ngot a severance package. But they knew he'd sue and\nwin 'cause he had before. And so I waited to check in on him 'cause we were so overwhelmed\nwith the request for help and he was saying people were\ncoming to his house still. And then he shot himself the next week. And because everyone knows I'm so public about my struggles with this stuff, everybody who fights\nthis stuff comes to me when they're having a hard time. And this is a very hard\npsychologically taxing business to be in, and even\nadmitting this right now, like I think about like\nall the vultures out there, they'll have fun with it. Just like the same way when my friend Mike Adams killed himself, there were people like\ncelebrating on Twitter that a man was dead because\nthey didn't like his tweets. But somehow that made them compassionate for some abstract other person. So I was getting a little\ndepressed and anxious. And the thing that really helped\nme more than anything else was confessing to my staff... Books take a lot of energy so I knew they didn't want to hear that. Not only was this taking\na lot of the boss's time, this was making him depressed and anxious. But when I finally told\nthe leadership of my staff, people that even though I try to maintain a lot of distance from,\nI love very, very much, it made such a difference, because I could be open about that. And the other thing was, have you heard there's\nconference dialogue? - Oh yes. - It's like an invite only thing. It's Orrin Hoffman runs it, it intentionally tries to get people over the political\nspectrum to come together and have off the record\nconversations about big issues. And it was nice to be in a room\nwhere liberal, conservative, none of the above were all like, oh, thank God someone's\ntaking on cancel culture. And where it felt like, it felt like maybe this\nwon't be the disaster for me and my family hat I was\nstarting to be afraid of. It would be that taking the stand might actually have a happy ending. - One thing that just stands out from that is the pain of cancellation\ncan be really intense. And that doesn't necessarily\nmean losing your job, but just even you can call it bullying, you can call it whatever name, but just some number of\npeople on the internet. And that number can be small kind of saying bad things to you, that can be a pretty powerful\nforce to the human psyche, which was very surprising. And then the flip side also of that, it really makes me sad\nhow cruel people can be. - Yeah, thinking that your\ncause is social justice in many cases can lead people to think, I can be as cruel as I\nwant in pursuit of this when a lot of times, it's just a way to sort\nof vent some aggression, on a person that you think\nof only as an abstraction. - So I think it's important\nfor people to realize that like whatever negative energy, whatever negativity you\nwant to put out there. Like there's real people\nthat can get hurt. Like you can really get people to one, be the worst version of themselves or to possibly take their own\nlife and it's not as real. - Yeah, well that's one of the\nthings that we do in the book to really kind of address\npeople who still try to claim this isn't real, is we just\nquote, we quote the Pope, we quote Obama, we quote James Carville, we quote Taylor Swift on cancel culture. And Taylor Swift's quote is essentially about like\nhow behind all of this, when it gets particularly nasty, there's this very clear, kill yourself kind of\nundercurrent to it and it's cruel. And the problem is that in\nan environment so wide open, there's always going to be someone who wants to be so transgressive\nand say the most hurtful, terrible thing. But then you have to remember\nthe misrepresentation, getting back to the old idioms. Sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me, has been re-imagined in campus debates in the most asinine way. People will literally say stuff like, but now we know words can hurt. And it's like, now we know words can hurt? Guys, you didn't have to come\nup with a special little thing that you teach children\nto make words hurt less if they never hurt in the first place. It wouldn't even make sense the saying, it's a saying that you repeat to yourself to give yourself strength when the bullies have noticed\nyou're a little weird. This might be a little personal. And it helps, it really does\nhelp to be like, \"listen, okay, assholes are\ngonna say asshole things and I can't let them have\nthat kind of power over me.\" - Yeah, it still is a learning experience 'cause it does hurt. - But for the good people\nout there who actually, just sometimes think that they're venting, you know, think about it. Remember that there are people\non the other side of it. - Yeah, for me it hurts my\nkind of faith in humanity. I know it shouldn't, but it does sometimes when I just see people\nbeing cruel to each other, it kind of, it floats a\ncloud over my perspective of the world that I wish\ndidn't have to be there. - Yeah, that was always\nmy sort of flippant. But the answer to that, if mankind is basically\ngood or basically evil being like the biggest debate\nin philosophy and being like, well the problem first is there's nothing basic about humanity. - Yeah, what gives you hope\nabout this whole thing, about this dark state that\nwe're in as you describe, how can we get out? What gives you hope that we will get out? - I think that people are sick of it. I think people are sick of not\nbeing able to be authentic. And that's really what censorship is. It's basically telling\nyou don't be yourself. Don't actually say what you think. Don't show your personality,\ndon't dissent, don't be weird, don't be wrong. And that's not sustainable. I think that people have\nkind of had enough of it, but one thing I definitely\nwanna say to your audience is it can't just be up to us\narguers to try to fix this. And I think that, and this may sound like\nit's an unrelated problem, I think if there were highly respected, let's say extremely\ndifficult ways to prove that you're extremely\nsmart and hardworking, that cost little or nothing that actually can give the Harvards and the Yales of the world\na run for their money, I think think that might\nbe the most positive thing we could do to deal with a\nlot of these problems and why. I think the fact that we\nhave become a weird America with a great anti-elitist tradition has become weirdly elitist in\nthe respect that we not only, again are our leadership coming from these few fancy schools, we actually have like\ngreat admiration for them. We kind of look up to them. But I think we'd have a\nlot healthier of a society if people could prove their excellence in ways that are coming from\ncompletely different streams and that are highly respected. I sometimes talk about\nthere should be a test that anyone who passes it gets like a BA in the\nhumanities, like a super BA. Something like someone not a GED, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about something that like, one out of only a couple,\nlike 100 people can pass. Some other way of actually of not going through\nthese massive, bloated, expensive institutions that\npeople can raise their hands and say, \"I'm smart and hardworking.\" I think that could be an\nincredibly healthy way. I think we need additional\nstreams for creative people to be solving problems,\nwhether that's on X or someplace else. I think that there's lots of\nthings that technology could do to really help with this. I think some of the stuff\nthat Sal Khan is working on at Khan Academy could really help. So I think there's a lot of ways, but they exist largely around coming up with new ways of doing things. Not just expecting the\nold things that have say $40 billion in the bank that they're going to reform themselves. And I've been picking on Harvard a lot, but I'm gonna pick on\n'em a little bit more. And I talk a lot about class again. And there's a great book called\n\"Poison Ivy\" by Evan Mandery which I recommend to everybody. It's outrageous, it sounds like me in a rant at Stanford, and I think the stat is,\nelite higher education has more kids from the top 1% than they have from the bottom 50 or 60% depending on the school. And when you look at how much they actually like\nreplicate class privilege, it's really distressing. So everybody should read \"Poison Ivy.\" - And above all else, if you're\nweird, continue being weird. - [Greg] Yeah, please. - And you're one of the most interesting, one of the weirdest in\nthe most beautiful way people I've ever met, Greg. Thank you for the really\nimportant work you do. - Everybody watch Kid Cosmic. - I appreciate the class, the hilarity that you\nbrought here today, man, this is an amazing conversation. Thank you for the work you do. Thank you, thank you. And for me, who deeply\ncares about education, higher education, thank you for holding the MITs\nand the Harvard's accountable for doing right by the\npeople that walk their halls. So thank you so much for talking today. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Greg Lukianoff. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with\nsome words from Noam Chomsky. \"If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of\nspeech for views you don't like. Gables was in favor of freedom\nof speech for views he liked, so was Stalin. If you're in favor of freedom of speech, that means you're in\nfavor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
