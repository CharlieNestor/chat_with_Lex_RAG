      "text": "- The United States has 1,770 nuclear weapons deployed, meaning those weapons could launch in as little as 60 seconds\nand up to a couple minutes. Some of them on the bombers\nmight take an hour or so. Russia has 1,674 deployed nuclear weapons, same scenario, their weapon systems are on par with ours. That's not to mention the\n12,500 nuclear weapons amongst the nine nuclear armed nations. The sucking up into the nuclear stem, 300 mile an hour winds,\nyou're talking about people miles out getting sucked\nup into that stem. When you see the mushroom cloud, Lex, that would be people, 30, 40 mile wide mushroom cloud blocking out the sun. And that speaks nothing of the radiation poisoning that follows. In addition to the launch\non warning concept, there's this other insane concept called sole presidential authority. And you might think, in a\ndemocracy that's impossible, you can't just start a war. Well, you can just start a nuclear war if you are the commander in chief, the President of the United States. In fact, you're the only\none who can do that. We are one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away\nfrom nuclear Armageddon. No matter how nuclear war starts, it ends with everyone dead. - The following is a\nconversation with Annie Jacobsen, an investigative journalist,\nPulitzer Prize finalist, and author of several\namazing books on war, weapons, government secrecy,\nand national security, including the books titled \"Area 51\", \"Operation Paperclip\", \"The\nPentagon's Brain Phenomena\", \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\", and her new book, \"Nuclear War\". This is a Lex Fridman\npodcast, to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Annie Jacobsen."

      "section": "Nuclear war",
      "text": "Let's start with an immensely dark topic, nuclear war, how many\npeople would a nuclear war between the United States and Russia kill? - So I'm coming back\nat you with a very dark answer and a very big number. And that number is 5 billion people. - You go second by\nsecond, minute by minute, hour by hour what would happen if the nuclear war started. So there's a lot of angles\nfrom which I would love to talk to you about this. First, how would the deaths happen in the short term and the long term? - So to start off, the\nreason I wrote the book is so that readers like you could see in appalling detail just how horrific nuclear war would be. And as you said, second\nby second, minute minute. The book covers nuclear\nlaunch to nuclear winter. I purposely don't get into the\npolitics that lead up to that or the national security maneuvers or the posturing or any of that, I just want people to know nuclear war is insane. And every source I\ninterviewed for this book, from Secretary of Defense, all retired, nuclear sub force commander,\nStratcom commander, FEMA director, on and on and on, nuclear weapons engineers,\nthey all shared with me the common denominator\nthat nuclear war is insane. First millions, then tens of millions, then hundreds of millions\nof people will die in the first 72 minutes of a nuclear war. And then comes nuclear winter where the billions happen from starvation. And so the shock power\nof all of this is meant for each and every one\nof us to say, wait, what? This actually exists behind\nthe veil of national security, most people do not think about\nnuclear war on a daily basis, and yet hundreds of thousands of people in the nuclear command and control are at the ready in the event it happens. - But it doesn't take too\nmany people to start one. - In the words of Richard Garwin, who was the nuclear weapons engineer who drew the plans for the\nIvy Mike thermonuclear bomb, the first thermonuclear bomb ever exploded in 1952. Garwin shared with me his opinion that all it takes is one nihilistic madman with a nuclear arsenal\nto start a nuclear war. And that's how I begin the scenario. - What are the different\nways it could start? Like literally, who presses a button, and what does it take to press a button? - So the way it starts is in space, meaning the US Defense Department has a early warning system. And the system in space is called SBIRS, a constellation of satellites\nthat is keeping an eye on all of America's enemies, so that the moment an ICBM launches, the satellite in space,\nand I'm talking about one 10th of the way to the moon, that's how powerful these\nsatellites are in geosync, they see the hot rocket exhaust on the ICBM in a fraction of a second after it launches, a fraction of a second. And so there begins this horrifying policy called launch on warning, and\nthat's the US counter attack. Meaning the reason that the United States is so ferociously watching\nfor a nuclear launch somewhere around the globe is\nso that the nuclear command and control system in the\nUS can move into action to immediately make a counterstrike. Because we have that\npolicy, launch on warning, which is exactly like it says, it means the United States will not wait to absorb a nuclear attack. It will launch nuclear weapons in response before the bomb actually hits."

      "section": "Launch procedure",
      "text": "- So the president, as part of the launch on warning policy, has six minutes. I guess it can't launch for six minutes, but at six minute mark\nfrom that first warning, the president can launch. - And that was one of the\nmost remarkable details to really nail down for this book when I was reporting this book and talking to Secretary\nof Defenses, for example, who are the people who\nadvise the president on this matter, you say to yourself, wait a minute, how could that possibly be? And so let's unpack that,\nso in addition to the launch on warning concept, there's\nthis other insane concept called sole presidential authority. And you might think, in a\ndemocracy that's impossible, you can't just start a war. Well, you can just start a nuclear war if you are the commander in chief, the President of the United States, in fact, you're the only\none who can do that. And we can get into later why that exists, I was able to get the origin story of that concept from Los Alamos, they declassified it for the book. But the idea behind that is that nuclear war will unfold so fast, only one person can be\nin charge, the president, he asked permission of no one, not the Secretary of\nDefense, not the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of\nStaff, not the US Congress. So built into that is\nthis extraordinary speed, you talk about the six minute window, and some people say,\noh, that's ridiculous, how do we know that six minute window? Well, here's the best\nsort of hitting the nail on the head statement I can give you, which is, in President Reagan's memoirs, he refers to the six\nminute window and he says, he calls it irrational, which it is, he says, \"How can anyone\nmake a decision to launch nuclear weapons based on\na blip on a radar scope?\" His words, to unleash Armageddon. And yet, that is the\nreality behind nuclear war. - Just imagine sitting there, one person, because a president is a\nhuman being, sitting there, just got the warning that Russia launched. You have six minutes. I meditate on my mortality every day, and here you would be\nsitting and meditating, contemplating not just your own mortality, but the mortality of all the\npeople you know, loved ones. Just imagining, like what\nwould be going through my head is all the people I know and love, like personally, and knowing\nthat they'll be no more, most likely, and if they somehow survive, they will be suffering\nand will eventually die. I guess the question\nthat kept coming up is, how do we stop this? Is it inevitable that\nit's going to be escalated to a full on nuclear war\nthat destroys everything? And it seems like it\nwill be, it's inevitable. In the position of the president, it's almost inevitable\nthat they have to respond. - I mean, one of the\nthings I found shocking was how little, apparently\nmost presidents know about the responsibility that\nliterally lays at their feet. So you may think through\nthis six minute window, I may think through\nthis six minute window, but what I learned, like for example, former Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, was really helpful in\nexplaining this to me, because before he was SecDef, he served as the director of the CIA. And before that he was the\nWhite House Chief of Staff. And so he has seen these different roles that have been so close to the president, but he explained to me that when he was the White House Chief of\nStaff for President Clinton, he noticed how President\nClinton didn't want to ever really deal\nwith the nuclear issue, because he had so many\nother issues to deal with. And that only when Panetta became Secretary of Defense, he told me, did he really realize the\nweight of all of this. Because he knew he would be the person that the president would turn to, were he to be notified\nof a nuclear attack. And by the way, it's\nthe launch on warning, it's the ballistic missile seen from outer space by the satellite, and then there also must\nbe a second confirmation from a ground radar system. But in that process, which\nis just a couple minutes, everyone is getting ready\nto notify the president, and one of the first\npeople that gets notified by NORAD, or by Stratcom, or by NRO, these different parties that all see the early warning data, one of the first peoples that's notified is the Secretary of Defense\nas well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, because those two together are\ngoing to brief the president about, sir, you have\nsix minutes to decide. And that's where you realize\nthe immediacy of all of this is so counter to imagining the scenario."

      "section": "Deterrence",
      "text": "And again, all the\npresidents come into office, I have learned, understanding\nthe idea of deterrence, this idea that we have\nthese massive arsenals of nuclear weapons pointed at one another, ready to launch, so that\nwe never have nuclear war. But what we're talking\nabout now is what if we did? What if we did? And what you've raised is like, this really spooky, eerie subtext of the world right now, because many of the nuclear armed nations are in direct conflict with other nations. And for the first time in decades, nuclear threats are actually coming out of the mouths of leaders,\nthis is shocking. - So deterrence, the polite, implied assumption is\nthat nobody will launch, and if they did, we would launch back and everybody would be dead. But that assumption\nfalls apart completely, the whole philosophy of it falls apart once the first launch happens. - Absolutely.\n- Then you have six minutes to decide, wait a minute,\nare we going to hit back and kill everybody on earth? Or do we turn the other cheek in the most horrific way possible? - Well, when nuclear war starts, there's no like battle for\nNew York or battle for Moscow, it's just literally, it\nwas called in the Cold War push button warfare, but in\nessence, that is what it is. Let's get some numbers on\nthe table if you don't mind, because when you're saying\nlike, wait a minute, we're just hoping that it holds, let's just talk about Russia and the US, the arsenals that are literally pointed at one another right now. So the United States has 1,770 nuclear weapons deployed, meaning those weapons could launch in as little as 60 seconds\nand up to a couple minutes. Some of them on the bombers\nmight take an hour or so. Russia has 1,674 deployed nuclear weapons, same scenario, their weapon\nsystems are on par with ours. That's not to mention the\n12,500 nuclear weapons amongst the nine nuclear armed nations. But when you think about\nthose kind of arsenals of just between the\nUnited States and Russia, and you realize everything\ncan be launched in seconds and minutes, then you\nrealize the madness of mad, that this idea that no one would launch because it would assure\neveryone's destruction, yes, but what if someone did? And in my interviews\nwith scores of top tier national security advisors,\npeople who advise the president, people who are responsible\nfor these decisions, if they had to be made, every single one of them\nsaid it could happen. They didn't say this would never happen. And so the idea is worth thinking about, because I believe that it pulls back the veil on a fundamental security that if someone were to use\na tactical nuclear weapon, oh well, it's just an escalation. It's far more than that."

      "section": "Tactical nukes",
      "text": "- So to you, the use of a\ntactical nuclear weapon, maybe you can draw the\nline between a tactical and a strategic nuclear weapon,\nthat could be a catalyst, like that's a very difficult\nthing to walk back from. - Oh my God, almost certainly, and again, every person in the national\nsecurity environment will agree with that,\ncertainly on the American side. Strategic weapons, those are\nlike big weapons systems, America has a nuclear\ntriad, we have our ICBMs, which are the silo-based missiles that have a nuclear\nwarhead in the nose cone, and they can get from one continent to the other in roughly 30 minutes. Then we have our bombers, B-52s and B-2s that are nuclear capable. Those take travel time to\nget to another continent, those can also be recalled,\nthe ICBMs cannot be recalled or redirected once launched. - That one is a\nparticularly terrifying one. So land launched missiles, rockets with a warhead, can't be recalled. - Cannot be recalled or redirected. And speaking of how little\nthe presidents generally know, as we were talking a moment ago, President Reagan in 1983\ngave a press conference where he misstated that submarine launched ballistic missiles could be recalled. They cannot be recalled. Here's the guy in charge of the arsenal if it has to get let loose, and he doesn't even know\nthat they cannot be recalled. So this is the kind of\nmisinformation and disinformation. UN Secretary General, Antonio\nGuterres, recently said, when he was talking about\nthe conflicts rising around the world, he said,\n\"We are one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away\nfrom nuclear Armageddon.\" - So just to sort of linger\non the previous point of tactical nukes, so you were\ndescribing strategic nukes, land launched bombers, submarine launched, what are tactical nukes? - So that's the triad,\nand we have the triad and Russia has the triad. Tactical nuclear weapons\nare smaller warheads that were designed to be used in battle. And that is what Russia\nis sort of threatening to use right now, that is\nthis idea that you would make a decision on the battlefield in an operational environment to use a tactical nuclear weapon. You're just sort of upping the ante. But the problem is that all treaties are based on this idea of no nuclear use. You cannot cross that line. And so the what would happen\nif the line is crossed is so devastating to even consider, I think that the conversation\nis well worth having among everyone that is\nin a power of position. As the UN Secretary General\nsaid, \"This is madness.\" This is madness, we must\ncome back from the brink, we are at the brink. - Can we talk about some other numbers? So you mentioned the number of warheads, so land launched, how long\ndoes it take to travel across the ocean from the\nUnited States to Russia, from Russia to the United States, from China to the United\nStates, approximately how long? - When I was writing an\nearlier book on DARPA, the Pentagon Science Agency, I went to a library down in San Diego called the Giza Library, to\nlook at Herb York's papers, Herb Bjork was the first chief scientist for the Pentagon for\nDARPA, then called ARPA. And I had been trying to get the number from the various agencies\nthat be, to answer you, like, what is the exact\nnumber and how do we know it? And like, does it change? And as technology advances,\ndoes that number reduce? All these kinds of questions, and no one will answer that\nquestion on an official level. And so much to my surprise, I found the answer in Herb\nYork's dusty archive of papers. And this is information\nthat was jealously guarded, I mean, it's not necessarily classified, but it certainly wasn't out there. And I felt like, wow, Herb\nYork left these behind for someone like me to find. And he wanted to know the\nanswer to your question, and as the guy in charge of it all, so he hired this group\nof scientists who then, and still are in many ways, like the Superman\nscientists of the Pentagon, and they're called the JASON Scientists, many conspiracies about them abound, I interviewed their founder and have interviewed many of them, but they whittled the\nnumber down to seconds. Specifically for Herb York,\nand it goes like this, 'cause this is where my jaw\ndropped and I went, wow, okay. So 26 minutes and 40 seconds from a launchpad in the Soviet\nUnion to the East coast. And it happens in three phases, very simple and interesting to remember, 'cause then suddenly all\nof this makes more sense, boost phase, mid-course phase,\nand then terminal phase. Boost phase, five minutes, that's when the rocket launches. So you just imagine a rocket\ngoing off the launchpad and the fire beneath it, again, that's why the satellites can see it, now it's becoming visual,\nnow it makes sense to me. Five minutes, and that's where\nthe rocket can be tracked. And then imagine learning, wait a minute, after five minutes, the\nrocket can no longer be seen from space. The satellite can only see\nthe hot rocket exhaust. Then the missile enters its\nmid-course phase, 20 minutes. And that's the ballistic part of it, where it's kind of\nflying up at between 500 and 700 miles above the earth, and moving very fast and with the earth, until it gets very close to its target, and the last 100 seconds\nare terminal phase. It's where the warhead reenters the atmosphere and detonates, 26 minutes and 40 seconds. Now, in my scenario, I open with North Korea launching a\none megaton nuclear warhead at Washington DC, that's the\nnihilistic madman maneuver, that's the bolt out of the blue attack that everyone in Washington\nwill tell you they're afraid of. And North Korea has a little\nbit different geography, and so I had MIT professor\nemeritus Ted Postol do the math, 33 minutes from a launchpad in Pyongyang to the East\nCoast of the United States. You get the idea, it's about 30 minutes, but hopefully now that allows readers to suddenly see all this as a real, you almost see it as poetry, as terrible as that may sound, you can visualize it and\nsuddenly it makes sense. And I think the sensemaking part of it is really what I'm after in this book, because I want people to\nunderstand, on the one hand, it's incredibly simple,\nit's just the people that have made it so complicated. - But it's one of those\nthings that can change all of world history\nin a matter of minutes. We just don't, as a human civilization, have experience with that. But it doesn't mean it'll never happen. It can happen just like that. - I mean, I think what you're after, and I couldn't agree more with is like, why is this fundamentally annihilating system, a\nsystem of mass genocide, as John Rubel, in the book refers to it, why does it still exist? We've had 75 years since there have been two superpowers with the nuclear bomb. So that threat has been there for 75 years and we have managed to stay alive. One of the reasons why\nso many of the sources in the book agreed to talk to me, people who had not\npreviously gone on the record about all of this, was because\nthey are now approaching the end of their lives. They spent their lives dedicated to preventing nuclear World War iii. And they'll be the\nfirst people to tell you we're closer to this as a\nreality than ever before. And so the only bright side of any of this is that the answer lies most\ndefinitely in communication."

      "section": "Nuclear submarines",
      "text": "- So there's a million\nother questions here. I think the details are fascinating and important to understand. So one, you also say nuclear submarines, you mentioned about 30\nminutes, 26, 33 minutes, but with nuclear submarines, that number can be much, much lower. So how long does it take\nfor a warhead missile to reach the East Coast\nof the United States from a submarine? - Just when you thought it was really bad, and then you kind of realize\nabout the submarines, I mean, the submarines are what are called second strike capacity, and\nsubmarines were described to me this way, they are as\ndangerous to civilization, and let me say, a nuclear armed,\nnuclear powered submarine, is as dangerous to\ncivilization as an asteroid. They are unstoppable,\nthey are unlocatable. The former chief of the\nnuclear submarine forces, Admiral Michael Conner, told me, \"It's easier to find a\ngrapefruit sized object in space than a submarine under the sea.\" So these things are like hell machines, and they're moving around\nthroughout the oceans, ours, Russia's, China's, maybe\nNorth Korea's, constantly, and we now know they're\nsneaking up to the east and west coast of the United States within a couple hundred miles. How do we know that, why do we know that? Well, I found a document\ninside of a budget that the defense department\nwas going to congress for more money recently and showed maps of precisely where these submarines, how close they were getting\nto the eastern seaboard. - So wait, wait, wait, so nuclear subs are getting within 200 miles? - Couple hundred miles, yes, they weren't precise on the number, but when you look at the map-\n- Couple hundred. - Yep, and that's when\nyou're talking about under 10 minutes from launch to strike. - Undetectable. - And they're undetectable,\nthe map making is done after the fact because\nof a lot of underwater surveillance systems that we have, but in real time, you cannot\nfind a nuclear submarine. And just the way a submarine launches, goes 150 feet below the surface to launch its ballistic missile. I mean, it comes out of the missile tube, and with enough thrust, the thrusters, they ignite outside the water and then they move into boost. And so the technology involved is just stunning and shocking, and again, trillions of dollars\nspent so that we never have a nuclear war, but\nmy God, what if we did. - As you write, they're called the handmaidens of the apocalypse. What a terrifying label. I mean, one of the things\nyou also write about,"

      "section": "Nuclear missiles",
      "text": "so for the land launched ones, they're presumably underground. So the silos, how long does it take to go from like pressing the button to them emerging from\nunderground for launch? And is that part detectable\nor it's only the heat. - So what's interesting about the silos, America has 400 silos, we've had more. But we have 400 and they're underground, and they're called Minuteman, after the Revolutionary War heroes. But the sort of joke in Washington is they're not called\nMinuteman for nothing, because they can launch in one minute. So the president orders\nthe launch of the ICBMs, ICBM stands for Intercontinental\nBallistic Missile, he orders the launch and\nthey launch 60 seconds later, and then they take 30 some odd minutes to get to where they're going. The submarines take about 14 or 15 minutes from the launch command\nto actually launching. And that has to do, I surmise, with the location of the\nsubmarine, its depth. Some of these things are\nso highly classified, and other details are shockingly available if you look deep enough or\nif you ask enough questions, and you can go from one\ndocument to the next to the next and really find these answers. - Not to ask top secret questions, but to what degree do you think the Russians know the\nlocations of the silos in the US and vice versa? - Lex, you and I can find\nthe location of every silo right now.\n- Oh no. - They're all there, and before\nthey were there on Google, they were there in maps,\nbecause we're a democracy and we make these things known. Now, what's tricky is that\nRussia and North Korea rely upon what are called\nRoad Mobile Launchers. So Russia has a lot of underground silos, all of the scenario takes you through these different facilities\nthat really do exist, and they're all sourced with\nhow many weapons they have and their launch procedures and whatnot. But in addition to\nhaving underground silos, they have road mobile launchers. And that means you just have\none of these giant ICBMs on a 22 axle truck that can move stealthily around the country\nso that it can't be targeted by the US Defense Department. We don't have those in\nAmerica, because presumably, the average American\nisn't gonna go for like, the ICBM road mobile launcher driving down the street\nin your town or city, which is why the defense\ndepartment will justify we need the second strike\ncapacity capability, the submarines, because I mean, the wonky stuff that is worth looking into if you really dig the book\nand are like, wait a minute, it's all footnoted\nwhere you can learn more about how these systems\nhave changed over time, and why more than anything,\nit's very difficult to get out of this catch 22 conundrum that we need nuclear\nweapons to keep us safe, that is the real enigma, because the other guys have them. And the other guys have\nsort of more sinister ways of using them, or at least\nthat's what the nomenclature out of the Pentagon will always\nbe when anyone tries to say, we just need to really think\nabout full disarmament. - You've written about\nintelligence agencies. How good are the intelligence\nagencies on this? How much does CIA know about the Russian launch\nsites, and capabilities, and command and control procedures and all of this, and vice versa? - I mean, all of this,\nbecause it's decades old, is really well known. If you go to the Federation\nof American Scientists, they have a team led by a\nguy called Hans Kristensen who runs what's called\nthe nuclear notebook, and he and his team every\nyear are keeping track of this number of warheads on these number of weapons systems, and because of the treaties,\nthe different signatories to the treaty all report these numbers, and of course, the different\nintelligence community people are keeping track of what's being revealed honestly and\nreported with transparency and what is being hidden. The real issue is the new systems that Russia is working on right now, and that will lead us, we are kind of moving into an era whereby the threat of actually\nhaving new weapon systems that are nuclear capable is very real, because of the escalating\ntensions around the world. And that's where the CIA, I would guess, is doing most of its work right now. - So most of your research\nis kind of looking at the older versions of the system, and presumably there's potentially secret development of new ones? Hopefully not.\n- Which violates treaties. - Yes.\n- So yes, that is where the intelligence agencies. But at a point it's overkill, literally and figuratively. People are up in arms about\nthese hypersonic weapons, well, we have a hypersonic\nweapons program, FALCON, Google Black Swift,\nthis is Lockheed's doing. DARPA exists to create\nthe vast weapon systems of the future, that is its job, it has been doing that\nsince its creation in 1957. I would never believe that\nwe aren't ahead of everyone, call me over informed or\nnaive, one or the other. That would be my position, because DARPA works from the\nchicken or the egg scenario, that once you learn about something, once you learn Russia's\ncreated this typhoon submarine, which may or may not be viable, it's too late if you\ndon't already have one. - We'll probably talk\nabout DARPA a little bit. One of the things that\nmakes me sad about Lockheed, many things makes me sad about Lockheed, but one of the things is\nbecause it's very top secret, you can't show off all\nthe incredible engineering going on there, the other thing\nthat's more philosophical, DARPA also, is that war seems to stimulate most of our, not most, but a large percent of our exciting innovation in engineering. But that's also the pragmatic\nfact of life on earth, is that the risk of annihilation is a great motivator for innovation, for engineering and so on. But yes, I would not\ndiscount the United States in its ability to build\nthe weapons of the future, nuclear included, again, terrifying."

      "section": "Nuclear football",
      "text": "Can you tell me about the\nnuclear football as it's called? - I think Americans are\nfamiliar with the football, at least anyone who sort of follows national security concepts,\nbecause it's a satchel, it's a leather satchel that\nis always with a military aid, in secret service nomenclature,\nthat's the mill aid. And he's trailing around\nthe president 24/7, 365 days a year, and also the\nvice president, by the way, with the ability to launch nuclear war in that six minute window all the time. That is also called the football, and it's always with the president. To report this part of the book, I interviewed a lot of\npeople in the Secret Service that are with the president\nand talk about this. And the director of the Secret Service, a guy called Lew Merletti, told me a story that I just really found fascinating. He was also in charge of\nthe president's detail, president Clinton, this was, before he was director\nof the Secret Service. And he told me the story about how, he said, \"The football\nis with the president at all times, period.\" They were traveling to Syria, and Clinton was meeting\nwith President Assad, and they got into an elevator, Clinton and the Secret Service team, and one of Assad's guys was like, no, like about the mill aid. And Lew said it was like a standoff, because there was no way,\nthey were not going to have the president with his\nfootball in an elevator. And it kind of sums up, for me anyways, you realize what goes\ninto every single one of these decisions. You realize the massive system of systems behind every item you might just see in passing and glancing on the news as you see the mill aid\ncarrying that satchel, well, what's in that satchel? I really dug into that\nto report this book. - What is in that satchel? (both giggling) - Well, okay, first of all, people always say it's\nincredibly classified, I mean, people talk about\nUFOs, it's incredibly, I mean, come on guys,\nthat is nothing burger, you wanna know what's really classified, what's in that football,\nwhat's in that satchel? But the PEAD, presidential\nemergency action directives, those have never been leaked,\nno one knows what they are. What we do know from one of the mill aids who spoke on the record, a\nguy called Buzz Patterson, he describes the president's orders, so if a nuclear war has begun, if the president has been told\nthere are nuclear missiles, one or more coming at the United States, you have to launch in a counter attack. The red clock is ticking, you have to get the blue\nimpact clock ticking. He needs to look at this list to decide what targets to strike and\nwhat weapon systems to use. And that is what is on,\naccording to Buzz Patterson, a piece of sort of laminated plastic, he described it like a Denny's menu. And from that menu, the president chooses targets and chooses weapon systems. - And it's probably super old school, like all top secret systems are, because they have to be\ntested over, and over, and over, and over, and over. - Yes, and it's non-digital. - Non-digital, it might literally be a Denny's menu from hell. - Right, and meanwhile I learned this only in reporting the book,\nthere is a identical black book inside the Stratcom bunker in Nebraska. Three command bunkers are\ninvolved when nuclear war begins, there's the bunker beneath the Pentagon, which is called the National\nMilitary Command Center. Then there is the bunker\nbeneath Cheyenne Mountain, which everyone, or many\npeople have heard of because it's been made famous in movies, that is a very real bunker. And then there is a third bunker, which people are not so familiar with, which is the bunker beneath\nstrategic command in Nebraska. And so it's described to me this way, the Pentagon bunker is the beating heart, the Cheyenne Mountain\nbunker is the brains, and the Stratcom bunker is the muscle. The Stratcom commander will receive word from the president, launch orders, and then directs the 150,000 people beneath him what to do, from the bunker beneath Stratcom. He gets the orders, then he\nhas to run out of the building and jump onto what's\ncalled the doomsday plane, we'll get into that in a minute, let me just finish the, I mean, but again- - This is good.\n- These are the details, this is like, these are the systematic sequential details that happen in seconds and minutes, and reporting them, I never ceased to be amazed by what a system it is. A follows B, it's just numerical. - Yeah, but as we discuss this procedure, each individual person\nthat follows that procedure might lose the big picture\nof the whole thing. I mean, especially when you\nrealize what is happening, that almost out of fear,\nyou just follow the steps. - Yep, or, okay, so imagine this, imagine being the president\nand you got that six minute, you're looking at your\nlist of strike options, you're being briefed by your chairman of the Joint Chiefs of\nStaff and your SecDef, and this other really spooky detail, in the Stratcom bunker, in addition to the nuclear strike\nadvisor who can answer very specific questions\nif the president's like, wait a minute, why are we\nstriking that, not that? There's also a weather officer, and this is the kind of human detail that kept me up at night,\nbecause that weather officer is in charge of explaining\nto the president really fast, how many people are going\nto die and how many people are going to die in minutes, weeks, months, and years\nfrom radiation fallout. - Because a lot of that has to do with the weather system.\n- Yes. Yes, and so the humanness balanced out with the\nmechanization of it all, it's just really grotesque. - So the doomsday plane\nfrom Stratcom, what's that? Where's it going, what's on it? - Okay, ready? It's gonna fly in circles. That's where it's going,\nit's flying in circles around the United States of America, so that nuclear weapons can be launched from the air after the ground systems are taken out by the incoming ICBMs, or the incoming submarine\nlaunched ballistic missiles. This has been in play since the fifties. These are the contingency plans for when nuclear war happens. So again, going back\nto this absurd paradox, nuclear war will never happen. Mutual assured destruction, that is why deterrence will hold. Well, I found a talk\nthat the deputy director of Stratcom gave to a\nvery close knit group, where he said, \"Yes, deterrence will hold, but if it fails, everything unravels.\" And think about that word unravels, and the unraveling is the\ndoomsday plane launches, the Stratcom commander jumps\nin, he's in that plane, he's flying around the United States, and he's making decisions, because the Pentagon's been taken out. At 9/11, by the way, Bush\nwas in the doomsday plane. - And Bush had to make decisions quickly, but not so quickly, not as quickly as he would've needed to have done if there's a nuclear launch. - I mean.\n- Six minutes. - It basically happens in three acts. There's the first 24\nminutes, the next 24 minutes, and the last 24 minutes. And that is the reality\nof nuclear weapons."

      "text": "- What is the interceptor\ncapabilities of the United States? How many nuclear missiles can be stopped? - I was at a dinner party\nwith a very informed person, like somebody who really\nshould have known this. This is what I was considering writing and reporting this\nbook, and he said to me, \"Oh Annie, that would never happen, because of our powerful\ninterceptor system.\" Okay, well, he's wrong,\nlet me tell you about our powerful interceptor system. First of all, we have\n44 interceptor missiles total, period, full\nstop, let me repeat, 44. Earlier we were talking\nabout Russia's 1,670 deployed nuclear weapons, how are those 44 interceptor\nmissiles gonna work? And they also have a\nsuccess rate of around 50%, so they work 50% of the time. There are 40 of them in Alaska, and there are four of them at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara. And they are responsible\nat about nine minutes into the scenario, after\nthe ICBM has finished that five minute boost\nphase we talked about, now it's in mid-course phase, and the ground radar\nsystems have identified, yes, this is an incoming ICBM, and now the interceptor\nmissiles have to launch. It's essentially shooting\na missile with a missile, inside the interceptor, which\nis just a big giant rocket, in its nose cone, it has what's called, the aptly named\nExoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. There's no explosives in that thing, it's literally just going to take out the warhead, ideally, with force. So one of them is going like mock 20, and I mean, the speeds at\nwhich these two moving objects hurdling through space\nare going is astonishing, and the fact that\ninterception is even possible is really remarkable,\nbut it's only possible 50% of the time. - Is it possible that\nwe only know about 44, but there could be a lot more? - No, impossible. That I would be willing to bet. - And how well tested\nare these interceptors? - Well, that's where\nwe get the success rate that's around 50% because of the tests. And actually, the interceptor program is, are you ready for this? It's on strategic pause right now, meaning the interceptor\nmissiles are there, but developing them and making them more effective is on strategic pause, because they can't be made more effective. People have these fantasies that we have a system like the Iron Dome, and they see this in current events, and they're like, oh, our\ninterceptors would do that, it's just simply not true. - Why can't an Iron Dome-like system be constructed for nuclear warheads? - We have systems I write\nabout called the THAAD system, which is ground based,\nand then the Edge system, which is on vessels, and these are great at shooting down some rockets, but they can only shoot\nthem sort of one at a time, you cannot shoot the mother\nload as it's coming in. Those are the smaller systems, the tactical nuclear weapons. And by the way, our THAAD systems\nare all deployed overseas, and our Edge systems are all out at sea. And again, reporting that,\nI was like, wait, what? You have to really hunker\ndown, are we sure about this? People really don't wanna\nbelieve this is an actual fact. After 9/11, Congress considered putting Edge's missiles and\nmaybe even THAAD systems along the west coast of the United States to specifically deal with the threats against nuclear armed North Korea. But it hasn't done so yet, and again, you have to ask yourself, wait\na minute, this is insanity, one nuclear weapon gets\nby any of these systems and it's full out nuclear warfare. So that's not the solution, more nuclear weapons is not the solution."

      "text": "- I'm looking for a hopeful\nthing here about North Korea. How many deployed nuclear\nwarheads does North Korea have? So does the current\nsystem, as we described it, the interceptors and so on, have a hope against the\nNorth Korean attack? The one that you mentioned\npeople are worried about. - So North Korea has 50, let's say 50 nuclear weapons right now. Some NGOs put it at more than 100, it's impossible to know\nbecause North Korea's nuclear weapons program\nhas no transparency. They're the only nuclear armed nation that doesn't announce when they do a ballistic missile\ntest, everyone else does, no one wants to start a\nnuclear war by accident. So if Russia's gonna launch\nan ICBM, they tell us, if we're gonna launch one, and\nI'm talking test runs here, with the dummy warhead, we\ntell them, not North Korea. That's a fact. So we're constantly up against\nthe fear of North Korea. In the scenario, I have the incoming North Korean one megaton weapon coming in, and the interceptor system\ntries to shoot it down. So there's not enough time, and this, by the way, I ran by all generals from the Pentagon\nwho run these scenarios for NORAD, and confirmed\nall of this as fact, this is the situation. So in the scenario I have\nthe nuclear ICBM coming in, the interceptor missiles try\nto shoot down the warhead, the capability is not like\nwhat's called shoot and look, there's not enough time to go, like, and we're gonna try to\nget it, we missed it, okay, let's go for another\none, so you have to go. (mimicking shooting) So in my scenario, we fire off four, which is about what I\nwas told, one to four, because you're worried about the next one that's gonna come in. You're gonna use up 10%\nof your missile force, of your interceptor force\non one and all four miss, and that's totally plausible, - Right, how likely are mistakes, accidents, false alarms taken as real, all this kind of stuff in this picture? So like, we've kind of assumed the detection works correctly. How likely is it possible? You've described this long\nchain of events that can happen, how possible is it just to make a mistake, a stupid human mistake along the way? - There have been at least\nsix known, like absolute, like, oh my God, close calls, thank God this happened, type scenarios. One was described to me with\nan actual personal participant, former secretary of defense, Bill Perry, and he described what\nhappened to him in 1979. He was not yet secretary of defense, he was the deputy director of\nthe research and engineering, which is like a big job at the Pentagon. The night watch fell on him, essentially, and he gets this call in\nthe middle of the night, he's told that Russia has launched, not just ICBMs, but submarine\nlaunched ballistic missiles are coming at the United States. And he's about to notify the president that the six minute window has to begin, when he learns it was a mistake. The mistake was that\nthere was a training tape with a nuclear war scenario. We haven't even begun to\ntalk about the nuclear war scenarios that the Pentagon runs, an actual VHS training tape\nhad been incorrectly inserted into a system at the Pentagon. And so this nuclear launch showed up at that bunker beneath the Pentagon and at the bunker beneath Stratcom, because they're connected, as being real. And then it was like, oh, whoops, it's actually a simulation test tape. And Perry described to\nme what that was like, the pause in his spirit, and his mind, and his heart when he realized I'm about to have to tell the president that he needs to launch nuclear weapons. And he learned just in the neck of time that it was an error. And that's one of five examples. - Can you speak to maybe,\nis there any more color to the feelings he was feeling? Like what was your sense? And given all the\nexperts you've talked to, what can be said about the seconds that one feels once finding\nout that a launch has happened, even if that information\nis false information? - For me personally, that's\nthe only firsthand story that I ever heard, because it's\nso rare and it's so unique. And most people in the\nnational security system, at least in the past, have been loathed to talk about any of this. It's like the sacred oath, it's taboo. It's taboo to go against\nthe system of systems that is making sure\nnuclear war never happens. Bill Perry was one of the\nfirst people who did this. And a lot of it, I believe, at least in my lengthy conversations with him, we had a lot of Zoom calls over Covid when I began reporting this, and he had a lot to do with me feeling like I could write\nthis book from a human point of view and not just\nfrom the mechanized systems. And I only lightly touch upon this, because it's such a\nfast, sweeping scenario, but Perry, for example,\nspent his whole life dedicated to building weapons of war, only later in life to\nrealize this is madness. And he shared with me that it was that idea about one's\ngrandchildren inheriting these nuclear arsenals, and the lack of wisdom that comes with their origin stories. When you're involved in\nthe ground up, apparently, perhaps your different kind of steward of these systems than if\nyou just inherit them, and they are pages in a manual. - People forget, you mentioned"

      "text": "the kind of nuclear war\nscenarios that the Pentagon runs. What do you know about those? - I mean, again, they are very classified. I mean, it was interesting coming across levels of classification I\ndidn't even know existed, like ECI, for example, is exceptionally controlled information. But the Pentagon nuclear\nwar gaming scenarios, they're almost all still classified. One of them was declassified recently, if you can call it that. I show an image of it in the book and it's just basically like, almost entirely redacted, and then like, there'll be a date, or it'll say like, phase one, and that one\nwas called Proud Prophet. But what was incredible about\nthe declassification process of that is it allowed a couple of people who were there to talk about it, and that's why we have that information. And I write about Proud\nProphet in the book, because it was super\nsignificant in many ways. One, it was happening right, in 1983, it was an insane moment in nuclear arsenals, there were 60,000 nuclear weapons, right now there's 12,500, so we've come a long way baby in terms of disarmament,\nbut there were 60,000. And by the way, that was\nnot the ultimate high, the ultimate high was 70,000. This is insane, and Ronald\nReagan was president and he orders this war\ngame called Proud Prophet. And everyone that mattered was involved, they were running the war game scenarios, and what we learned from\nhis declassification is that no matter how nuclear war starts, there was a bunch of different scenarios, with NATO involved, without NATO, all different scenarios, no\nmatter how nuclear war starts, it ends in Armageddon, it\nends with everyone dead. I mean, this is shocking\nwhen you think about that coupled with the idea\nthat all that has been done in the 40 some odd years since is, okay, let's just really lean in even harder to this theoretical\nphenomena of deterrence, 'cause that's all it is,\nit's just a statement, Lex, like deterrence will hold. Okay, well, what if it doesn't? Well, we know from Proud Prophet\nwhat happens if it doesn't. - Almost always, so there's no\nmechanisms in the human mind, in the human soul that stops it, in the governments that we've created. The procedure escalates always. - I mean, here's a crazy nomenclature jargon thing for you, ready? Escalate to deescalate,\nthat's what comes out of it. Think about what I just\nsaid, escalate to deescalate. So someone strikes you\nwith a nuclear weapon, you're gonna escalate it. General Hayden recently said,\nhe was Stratcom commander, he was sort of saber rattling\nwith North Korea during Covid and he said, \"They need to know, if they launch one nuclear\nweapon, we launch one, if they launch two, we launch two.\" But it's actually more than that, they launch one, we launch 80. That's called escalate\nto deescalate, like pound the you know what out of\nthem to get them to stop. - But I mean, there is,\nto make a case for that, there is a reason to the madness, because you want to threaten\nthis gigantic response. But when it comes to\nit, the seconds before, there is still a probability\nthat you'll pull back. - Which brings us to the\nmost terrifying facts that I learned in all of that, and that has to do with errors. Not errors of, like we\nspoke about a minute ago with a simulation test tape, I'm talking about if one madman, one nihilistic madman were\nto launch a nuclear weapon as I write in this scenario, and we needed to escalate to deescalate, we needed to send nuclear weapons at, let's say North Korea\nas I do in my scenario. Well, what is completely unknown to 98% of the planet is that not only do the Russians\nhave a very flawed satellite system, so that\nthey cannot interpret what is happening properly, but there is a absolutely\nexistential flaw in the system, which Secretary of Defense,\nLeon Panneta confirmed with me. Which is that our ICBMs\ndo not have enough range, if we launch a counter attack\nagainst, say North Korea, our ICBMs must fly over Russia. They must fly over Russia. So imagine saying, oh no, no, these 82 warheads that are gonna actually strike the Northern Korean peninsula are not coming for you Russia,\nour adversary right now that we're sort of saber\nrattling with, just trust us. And that is where nuclear\nwar unfolds into Armageddon. And that hole in national\nsecurity is shocking, and as Panetta told me, no\none wants to discuss it. - And if one nuclear weapon\ndoes reach its target, I presume communication\nbreaks down completely, or like there's a high risk\nof breakdown of communication. - Well, let's back up, we are\nboth presumptuous to assume that communication could\neven happen prior to, and let me give you a\nvery specific example, during the Ukraine war,\nif perhaps you remember, I think it was in November of 2022, news reports erroneously stated that a Russian rocket, a Russian\nmissile had hit Poland, a NATO country, it turned\nout to be a mistake, but for several hours, this\nwas actually the information that was all over the news, breaking news. 36 hours later, the chairman\nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley,\ngave a press conference and talked about this and admitted that he could not reach\nhis Russian counterpart during those 36 hours. He could not reach him. How are you going to not have an absolute Armageddon-like furor with nuclear weapons in the air if people can't get on the phone during a ground war? - I'd like to believe that there's people in major nations that don't give a damn about the bullshit of politics and can always just pick up the phone, sort of very close to the\ntop, but not at the very top, and just cut through the bullshit of it in situations like this. - I hope that's true, I doubt it is, and lemme tell you why, and neither you nor I are\npolitical from what I gather, so I just write about Potus,\nPresident of the United States. You have no idea what my politics are, because they shouldn't matter, no one should be for nuclear war, or no one should be for\nnational insecurity, yes, you wanna have a strong nation, but once you get into politics, then you're talking about sycophants. And the more a political\nleader becomes divisive, becomes polemic, the more his platform is predicated on hating the other side, either within his own country or with alleged enemy nations. The more you surround yourself, as we see in the current\nday, with sycophants, with people who will tell\nyou not only what they think you wanna hear, but will\nhelp them to hold onto power. So you don't have wise decision makers, long gone are the days\nwhere we had presidents who had advisors on\nboth sides of the aisle. That's really important,\nbecause you wanna have differing opinions, but as\nthings become more viperous, both here in the United States and in nuclear armed nations, all bets are off at whether your advisors are gonna give you good advice."

Maybe you could speak\nto the detail of that, but also to the spirit of\nthe way they see the world, how many of them are warmongers? How many of them are kind\nof big picture peace, humanity type of thinkers? - Well, again, we're talking\nabout that six minute window, so it's not exactly like you can, let me put a pot of coffee\non and really tell me what you think and we can strategize here, you have your SecDef and your chairman, maybe the vice chairman, and, okay, we haven't even begun\nto talk about the fact that at the same time\nthese advisors also have a parallel concern and that's called continuity of government. So while they're trying to advise on the nuclear counterstrike in response to the incoming nuclear missile,\nthey have to be thinking how are we gonna keep the\ngovernment functioning when the missiles start hitting, when the bombs start going off? And that is about getting yourself out of the Pentagon, let's say, getting yourself to one\nof these nuclear bunkers that I write about at length in the book. So how much can you ask of a human? Because it comes down to a human, secretary of defense is a human. And imagine that job while\ntrying to advise the president. And then there's also a\nreally interesting term, which I learned about called\njamming the president, which is often understood in Washington that the military advisors would, we don't know if this is\nlegit, we've never seen it put to the test, but\njamming the president means the military advisors are gonna push for a really aggressive\ncounter attack immediately. And again, you're the\npresident who's not really been paying attention to this, because he has many other\nthings to deal with, speed is not conducive to wisdom. - Can you speak to the\njamming the president? So your sense is the advisors would by default be pushing for\naggressive counter attack. - That is a term in sort\nof the national security nuclear command and control\nhistorical documentation that many of the people\nthat you might call the more dovish type\npeople are worried about, that the more hawkish people are going to, the military advisors are\ngonna be jamming the president to make these decisions\nabout which targets, not if, but what.\n- Right, which targets. The argument will be about which targets, - Yes,\n- not about if. - Yes. - I hope that even the war mongers would at this moment,\nbecause what underlies the idea of you wanting to go to war? It's power, it's like\nwanting to destroy the enemy and be the big kid on the block. But with nuclear war, it just\nfeels like that falls apart. Do do you think war\nmongers actually believe they can win a nuclear war? - Well, you've raised a\nreally important question that we look to the historical\nrecord for that answer, because astonishingly, all of this began, like when Russia first got the bomb in 1949, the powers that be, and I write about them in the book in a setup for the moment of launch, it's called how we got here. And you see, and I cite\ndeclassified documents from some of these early meetings where nuclear war plans\nwere being laid out. And absolutely, back in\nthe 1950s, the generals and the admirals that were\nrunning the nuclear command and control system believed\nthat we could fight and win a nuclear war despite hundreds of millions of people dying. This was the prevailing thought. And only over time did the kind of concept\ncome into play that no, we can never have a nuclear war, it's the famous Gorbachev\nand Reagan joint statement. A nuclear war cannot be won\nand must never be fought. But before that, many people\nbelieved that it could be won, and they were preparing for that."

      "text": "- Not to be political\nand not to be ageist, but do cognitive abilities and all that kind of\nstuff come into play here? So if so much is riding on the president, is there tests that are conducted? Is there regular training procedures on the president that you're aware of? Do you know? - I don't think that has\nanything to do with ageism. I think it's an earnest\nquestion, a really powerful one, and if people were to ask\nthat question of themselves, or their sort of dinner party guests, or their family around\nthe dinner table guests, you might come to a real good conclusion about how bad our political system is and how bad our\npresidential candidates are. Because why on earth there\nwould be two candidates, one of whom has cognitive problems, and the other of whom\nhas judgment problems. These are the two biggest issues with the nuclear launch,\njudgment and cognition. And so where's the young-ish, thoughtful, forward-looking wise, dedicated civil servant running for president? I know that sounds fantastical, but I wish it weren't. - So that's one of the things\nyou should really think about when voting for president,\nis this scenario that we've been describing,\nthese six minutes. Imagine the man or woman\nsitting there for six minutes waiting for the pot of coffee. - But I think about that issue with any war, I mean, prior to writing \"Nuclear War, A Scenario\",\nI previously wrote six books on military and intelligence programs\ndesigned to prevent nuclear war. And I believe, the president\nas commander in chief, should be of the highest\ncharacter possible, because the programs, the wars that we have fought since\nWorld War ii have all been, how many octogenarian\nsources have I interviewed? I'm talking about Nobel\nlaureates, and weapons designer, and spy pilots, and engineers in general, they've all said to me with great pride, we prevented World War\niii, nuclear World War iii. But that idea that the commander in chief and everyone within the\nnational security apparatus, should be making really\ngood decisions about war, it's the oldest cliche in the world that the wars are fought by the young kids, and that is not a cliche, it's true. And so the character\npart about the president should be in play whether we're\nthinking about nuclear war or any war, in my opinion. - Well, I agree with you first of all, but it feels like when nuclear war, one person becomes, like\nexponentially more important, with regular war, the\ndecision to go to war or not, advisors start mattering\nmore, there's judgment issues. You could start to make arguments for sort of more leeway in terms of what kind of people we elect. It seems like with nuclear\nwar, there's no leeway, it's like one person can resist the jamming the president\nforce, the war mongers, all the calculation\ninvolved in considering what are the errors, the mistakes, the missiles flying over\nRussia, the full dynamics of the geopolitics going on in the world, consider all of humanity,\nthe history of humanity, the future of humanity, all of it just loaded\nin to make a decision, then it becomes much more important that your cognitive abilities are strong and your judgment abilities against powerful, wise people just as a human being are strong. So I think that's something\nto really, really consider when you vote for president. But to which degree is it\nreally on the president versus to the people advising. - Oh no, it's on the president, the president has to make the call. And that six minute\nwindow happens so fast, I mean, the president is gonna be being moved for part of that time, the Secret Service is gonna\nbe up against Stratcom, Stratcom saying, we\nneed the launch orders, and the Secret Service is gonna be saying, we need to move the president. So it's not as much that\nhe's delegating the issues, it's more like the issue\nis being postponed, because there is only one issue, for the president to say these targets, for him to choose from the Denny's menu, okay, this is what we're gonna go with. And then this astonishing thing happens, the president takes out his wallet, he has a card in it that's\ncolloquially called the biscuit, and that card with the\ncodes matches up an item in the briefcase in the football, that then is received by an\nofficer underneath the bunk, underneath the Pentagon in that bunker, it's a call and response,\nLex, it's like alpha zeta, that's it, and then back so that the individual in the bunker\nrealizes they are getting the command from the president. And then that order is passed to Stratcom. And Stratcom, the commander of Stratcom, and I interviewed a former\ncommander of Stratcom, commander of Stratcom then follows orders, which is he delivers the launch orders to the nuclear triad. And what's done is done."

      "text": "- What would you do if\nyou were the commander of Stratcom in that\nsituation, what would you do? Because my gut reaction right now, if you just throw me in\nthere, I would refuse orders. - Okay, so good question,\nI asked that exact question to one of my very helpful\nsources on the book, Dr. Glenn McDuff, who is at Los Alamos, and who for a while was the classified, they have a museum that's\nclassified within the lab, and he was the historian in charge of it. So he's a nuclear weapons engineer, he worked on Star Wars\nduring the Reagan era, and he does a lot having\nto do with the history of Los Alamos, and by the way, the Oppenheimer movie really, 'cause I've reported on nuclear\nweapons for 12 years now, and Oppenheimer movie had a very, to me, positive impact on Los Alamos's transparency with people like me. They had a real willingness\nto share information. I think before, perhaps\nthey were on their heels feeling they needed to\nbe on the defensive, but now they're much more forthcoming, they were super helpful. I can tell you the origin\nstory of the football, which they declassified for the book. But I asked this question\nto Dr. Glenn McDuff, like in a different manner, I said, \"Is there a chance that\nthe Stratcom commander would defy orders? And he said, \"Annie, you have a better chance\nwinning Powerball.\" - Why do you think, what's\nhis intuition behind that? - You don't wind up a Stratcom commander unless you are someone who follows orders. You follow orders. - You don't think there's\na deep humanity there? Because his intuition is about everything we know so\nfar, but this situation has never happened in\nthe history of earth. - All right, so you're\nraising a really tricky, interesting conundrum\nhere, because during COVID, when President Trump and\nthe leader of North Korea were kind of locked in\nvarious relationships with one another, good, bad, threatening, non-threatening, friendly,\njust bananas you might say, like not presidential behavior. If you were someone\nwatching c-span like I do, nerding out on what Stratcom was actually saying about all this, you noticed that Stratcom\ncommanders were speaking out publicly to Congress more so than I had ever seen before. And this issue came up, would\nyou defy presidential order? So the caveat, I would\nsay, to Mcduff's answer of easier to win the Powerball, is that if the commander of Stratcom interpreted the president's behavior to be unreliable, to be non-presidential, then dot dot dot, but now you're into some really radical territory. - Well, I mean, fundamentally, it feels like just looking\nat all the presidents of the United States in my lifetime, it feels like none of them are qualified for this six minutes. I could see as being the\ncommander of Stratcom and being like, this guy, like basically respecting no president. I know you're supposed to\nthe commander in chief, but in this situation, saying like, I mean, everybody, Bush,\nObama, Trump, Biden, if I was a commander of\nStratcom, I would be like, what does this guy know about any of this? I would defy orders, I\nmean, in this situation, when the future of human civilization hangs in the balance, I mean, to be the person that says, yes, launch, no matter what, I just can't\nsee a human being on earth being able to do that in the\nUnited States of America. That's a hell of a\ndecision, like, this is it, that's it.\n- That's it. - Well, but now you've raised a great important presentation essentially, because what you're\nsaying is people be aware, be aware of like why you're voting or why certain individuals\nare being escalated to even being able to run for president. What does that mean? Why are people in America\nnot more involved? As citizens, do we have a\nresponsibility for that? Because you've opened up the\ndoor for people to understand, okay, the ultimate thing is\nthe nuclear launch decision. So if a person can't be trusted with that, everything unravels from there. - Also, I wanna look up who's\nthe commander of Stratcom now. (Lex giggling) Speaking of which, you've interviewed a lot of experts for this book. Is there some commonalities about the way, you've talked about this a little bit, but in the way they see\nthis whole situation, what like scares them the most about this whole system and the whole\npossibility of nuclear war? - I first learned about nuclear\nweapons from a guy called Al O'Donnell, who appears\nin my earlier books, because I interviewed\nhim for over a period of four and a half years,\nbecause he was an engineer who actually wired nuclear\nbombs in the 1950s. He was a member of the\nManhattan Project in 1946, worked on Operation Crossroads, the first explosions of nuclear\nbombs after the war ended, after World War II ended, and went on to arm, wire, and fire 186 out of the 200 some odd atmospheric nuclear tests that the United States did before this was banned. And so I learned from him\nthe power of these weapons. And I learned from him this very, almost nationalistic\nidea about how important it was to have nuclear weapons. And while I learned a\nlot about his human side, I also saw the side of him\nthat was very Cold War warrior. So he was kind of the first,\nand then, I don't know, there've been a hundred\npeople that have been directly involved in nuclear\nweapons along the way. Billy Waugh, who was my subject of my main sort of central figure in a book I wrote about\nthe CIA's paramilitary called \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\". And Waugh HALO jumped a tactical nuclear weapon\ninto the Nevada test site with a small team,\nalmost unknown to anyone. Only recently declassified. And so his position was like, tactical nuclear weapons\nmay end up being used. So I'm trying to speak here to the scope of different people I have\ninterviewed over the years. And what has happened is, as I've gotten closer to\nthe present day in arrears, there seems to be a growing movement from some of these cold warriors, off the position of nuclear weapons make us great and strong, toward something must be done to reduce this threat."

      "text": "- How much do you know, in the same way that you\nknow about the United States, how much do you know\nabout the Russian side, maybe the Chinese side, Indian, Pakistan, all of this, like how their\nthinking differs perhaps? - Yes, well, for that, you\nwanna go to the experts. So for Russia, for example, there's a guy called Pavel Podvig, who is probably the West's top expert on Russian nuclear forces. He works in parallel with the UN, he also studied in Moscow. So my information comes from him, like you do all the footwork\nto know what questions to ask, and then you take the very\nspecific questions to him. And I learned from him about how the Russian command\nand control goes down. And it's very similar to ours, because America and Russia have been at sort of nuclear dueling with one another for 75 years now, and so\neverything we have, they have, with the exception of we\nhave a great satellite system and they have a super flawed\none, theirs is called Tundra, and even Pavel Podvig admitted that there's serious flaws in Tundra. The Russian satellite system, for example, can mistake sunlight for flames, can mistake clouds for a\nnuclear launch, this is a fact. And what was interesting\nin interviewing him was also this recent very, very dangerous shift in Russian nuclear\npolicy, which is this, many Russian experts will tell you that Russia has always maintained that it never had a\nlaunch on warning policy. Now, I don't know if\nI believe that's true, but I'm just telling you what they say. And this is coming from the generals, the Cold War generals\nin Soviet Russia saying, \"Oh, no, no, no, we would wait,\" they were kind of playing\nthe noble warrior, \"we would wait to absorb a nuclear attack until we launched.\" So many American experts will tell you that that's just posturing and propaganda, but that was their official position. And that changed just two years ago when Putin gave a speech, and he said that their\nposition had changed, that they will no longer\nwait to absorb an attack, once they learn of, how did he phrase it? He called it like the\ntrajectory of the missiles, which is a way of talking about parody, the same way we see the missile\ncoming over in midcourse, Putin made that same statement\nand said we would launch. - What do you know of the way Putin thinks about nuclear weapons and nuclear war? Is it just something to\nallude to in a speech or do you think he contemplates the possibilities of nuclear war? - I don't know, but if I had\nto guess it would go like this, I would look at his background, and he comes from the intelligence world. So my experience in\ninterviewing old timers who've spent decades working\nfor the CIA, or even NRO, or NSA, I know the way they think from having spent hundreds\nof hours interviewing them. And then I know the way that military men think, and\nit's very different. So Putin's not a military person per se, he's an intelligence officer. So what would concern me there, if I had to guess about his mindset, has to do with paranoia. Most intelligence officers\nmust have a degree of healthy paranoia or\nthey're gonna wind up dead. And so that's not a great quality to have. - You would be more trigger happy perhaps. So you would be more prone to respond to erroneous signals. - And you'd be suspicious,\nand you can see that now. There's such a incredible distrust and sort of real conflict between Russia, between its leader and NATO, between its leader and all of the west. And then that is fueled by his closest advisors, kind of, they seem to be, from the\nstatements they have made that I've read in translation,\nthey seem to be fostering that same idea that NATO really has it in for Russia, America really has it in, and that is so dangerous\nand disheartening. - And perhaps makes it less likely that the president would pick up the phone and talk to the other president. - Or that the close\nadvisors near the president would make that happen. - You were talking about the\nprocedure with the football."

And the nuclear command\nand control system, and really the triad, functions on analog systems, it functions on old school systems, if there's not digital interface,\nyou can't hack into it. So most of the issues\nthat I raise in the book have to do with what happens to cyber after a nuclear attack. What happens to cyber in the minutes after a bomb, a nuclear weapon strikes America? And how that impacts the ability for people to communicate\nwith one another. And that's when chaos takes control. - Well, let's talk about it."

      "text": "So God forbid, if a nuclear weapon reaches its target, what happens? Perhaps you could say what you think would be the first target\nhit, would it be the Pentagon? - I was told by many people I interviewed that the biggest fear in Washington DC is what's called a bolt\nout of the blue attack. That's an unwarranted nuclear\nattack against Washington DC. The target would be the Pentagon, and that's what I begin the scenario with. And I reported in graphic, horrifying detail what happens. - Yes you did.\n- Because I don't know what's worse, me writing that all out or the fact that it's all documented\nby the defense department. I mean, they have been\ndocumenting the effect of nuclear weapons on people,\nand animals, and things since the earliest days of the Cold War. And all of the details I pull\nare from these documents, like the effects of nuclear weapons. And again, this document was\nthe original information, the original data in this document come from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was all classified,\nand then it was built upon by those 200 some odd atmospheric nuclear weapons test we did. And we're talking about\nlike millimeters and inches, we're talking about the defense\ndepartment knowing that, oh, seven and a half miles out, the upholstery on cars\nwill spontaneously combust, the pine needles will catch on fire, they will start more fires. You have all kinds of\nmayhem and chaos happening based on reported facts from observations. And this is really shocking and grotesque at the same time. - So one warhead reaches the Pentagon, everybody in the Pentagon parishes. - 180 million degrees. The fireball on a one\nmegaton nuclear weapon is 19 football fields of fire. Think about that, nothing remains. Nothing remains. - And there's then a radius where people die immediately, and then there's people\nthat are dead when found. And then there's people\nthat will die slowly. - Yes.\n- And eccentric rings. - And again, rings defined\nby defense scientists, but before that, the bomb goes off, then there's this blast wave that's like several hundred miles an hour, pushing out like a bulldozer,\nknocking everything down. Bridges, buildings, I mean, you can read FEMA manuals about what\nthe rubble will be like, you're talking about 30 feet deep rubble as the buildings go over\n6, 7, 8, 10 miles out. That speaks nothing of the mega\nfires that will then ensue. So once all these people die, and third degree radiation burns, did you even know there was such a thing as fourth degree radiation burns? We're talking about the\nwind ripping the skin off people's faces many miles out. And then you have a sucking action, many people are familiar with what the nuclear mushroom\ncloud looks like, and its stem actually creates, and again, this is from physicists who advise the defense department on this, the sucking up into the nuclear stem, 300 mile an hour winds,\nyou're talking about people miles out getting sucked\nup into that stem. When you see the mushroom cloud, Lex, in a nuclear war, that would be people, those are like the remnants of people and of things in the cloud, 30, 40 mile wide mushroom cloud blocking out the sun,\nand that speaks nothing of the radiation poisoning that follows. - And then the power grid goes out. Basically everything we rely on in terms of systems in\nour way of life goes out."

      "text": "You write, quote, \"Those\nwho somehow manage to escape death by the\ninitial blast, shockwave, and firestorm suddenly\nrealize an insidious truth about nuclear war, that\nthey're entirely on their own. Here begins a, quote,\n'Fight for food and water.'\" I mean, that is a wake up call on top of a wake up call, that we go back to a kind of primitive fight for survival each on their own. - And by the way, those\ndetails were given to me by Obama's FEMA director, Craig Fugate. So FEMA is the agency in America\nthat plans for nuclear war, and what Fugate said to me was, \"Annie, we plan for asteroid strikes, these are called low probability, but high consequence events.\" And FEMA is the organization that when there's a\nhurricane, or an earthquake, or a flood, FEMA steps in, and they do what's called\npopulation protection planning. They take care of people. And what Fugate told me\nis, after a nuclear strike, after a bolt out of the blue\nattack, he used those terms, there is no population\nprotection, everyone's dead. And he means that metaphorically, but also kind of more literally, because he just said, \"At that point, you just hope that you stocked Pedialyte.\" - What do you think happens to humans? Like how does human nature manifest itself in such conditions? Do you think like brutality will come out, like people will, just for survival, will steal, will murder? - I can't imagine that not happening, I think that's why people\nlove post-apocalyptic television shows and films,\nbecause they see that, and then of course, there's\nalways one great charismatic person who's trying to restore morality. And these are great\nnarratives that people like to tell themselves in the\nworld of science fiction. But what we're dealing\nwith is science fact in this scenario, and it is meant to terrify people into\nrealizing, wait a minute, this is a conversation that\nabsolutely should be had while it can still be had. Because the reality is,\nwhen you have the director of FEMA telling you this,\nit's a real wake up call. And by the way, Craig Fugate was so transparently human with me, and I quote him directly in the book, but he spoke about, you\nasked me earlier about, like what would be going\nthrough the president's mind, and we don't know, I don't know, but Craig Fugate told me what would be going through his mind. And he said along the\nlines, I'm paraphrasing, \"Like it's almost something\nyou couldn't even comprehend, it would just like ruin you.\" His words are really\npowerful, and of course, the FEMA director in the scenario is notified in that first window, while the ballistic missile is on its way and no one in America yet knows, and I have the FEMA director\npull over to the side of the road and jump in\na helicopter sent for him to take him to the\nbunker that FEMA goes to, which is called Mount Weather. And so Fugate was aware\nthat as FEMA director you would likely be taken to a safe place, however many hours you're gonna be safe, or days, or maybe weeks, or maybe months. But as I also learned from the\ncyber people I interviewed, that there's a complete fallacy that these military bases\ncan continue functioning. They run on diesel fuel, and when the fuel stops pumping,\nthere's no more generators. - Electricity's gone, communication lines are all gone, the food supply, all of it, all the supply chains gone. It's terrifying. And that's just in the first few days, first few hours."

      "section": "Nuclear winter",
      "text": "In part five, you described the 24 months and beyond after this first\nhour we've been talking about. So what happens to earth,\nwhat happens to humans if a full on nuclear war happens? - So for that, I was super privileged to talk to Professor Brian Toon, who is one of the original five authors of the nuclear winter theory. And that theory was developed in, was published in the early 1980s. One of Professor Toon's\nprofessors was Carl Sagan, who was sort of the most famous author of the nuclear winter theory. And there were all kinds of controversies about it when it came out, including the Defense Department saying it was Soviet propaganda, which it wasn't. And what the nuclear winter authors conceded back in the eighties was that their modeling was just the best it could be based on what\nthey had at the time. And so now flash forward\nto where we are in 2024, and talking to professor\nToon, who's been working on this issue for all these decades since, he shared with me how the climate models today\nwith the systems we have, the computer systems reveal that actually nuclear winter is worse. So to answer your questions, the bombs stop falling, in my scenario, 72 minutes after they first launch, the bombs stop falling, and\nthen the mega fires begin. Each nuclear weapon will have, according to the Defense Department, a mega fire that will burn\nbetween 100 and 300 square miles. So 1,000 weapons, 1,500 weapons, think about those mega fires. Everything is burning, forests, cities, think about the pyro toxins in all the cities, high rises burning. And all of this soot\ngets lofted into the air, according to Toon, some 300 billion pounds of soot. And what happens, it blocks out the sun. And without sun, we have nuclear winter, we have a situation whereby ice sheets form, you're talking about bodies of water in places like Iowa being frozen for 10 years. - So temperature drops. - Temperature plummets. And there are all kinds of papers that have been written about this, using modern systems. And the numbers vary, but the bottom line is agriculture fails. - Foods obviously dies. So the agriculture system\ncompletely shuts down, so the food sources shut down. So there's no food, there's no sun, temperature drops\ncompletely, no electricity. - And we haven't even spoken\nof radiation poisoning, because the radiation\npoisoning kills many people in the aftermath of the nuclear exchange. But after the nuclear freeze ends, after nuclear winter, after\nthe sun starts to come back, let's say 8, 9, 10 years, now you have no ozone layer, or you have a severely\ndepleted ozone layer, and so the sun's rays are now poisonous. So if you have people living underground, and you have this great thawing, and with that great thawing\ncomes pathogens and plague, and you have this system where\nthe small bodied animals, the insects and whatnot begin\nreproducing really fast, and the larger body\nanimals, like you and me, begin to go extinct. Professor Toon said it\nto me this way, he said, \"66 million years ago,\nan asteroid hit earth, killed all the dinosaurs and wiped out 70% of the species, and nuclear\nwar would likely do the same.\" And so here we are talking about this because there is a difference. There's nothing you can\ndo about an asteroid, but there is something you\ncan do about a nuclear war. - Do you think it's\npossible that some humans will survive all of this? So if we look, I mean,\nhow long would it be? Would it be decades? Would it be centuries before the earth starts to have the\ncapacity to grow food again? - Carl Sagan talked about\nthat in this amazing book that he wrote with two\nscientist colleagues called \"The Cold and the Dark\". And there's a bunch of\nessays about exactly this, like what would happen and\nhow long would it take? It's really interesting, it's dated, it's from the eighties,\nbut man, is it shocking. And you think about that where, okay, so men return to sort of the worst, most base versions of\nthemselves, civilization is gone, meaning civil society,\nthere's no rule of law, it's just fend for yourself. There's people fighting\nover what little resources there are, man returns to\na hunter gatherer state. And to really think about\nthis idea, I looked at the oldest known archeological\nsite in the world in Turkey, which is called Gobekli Tepe. And it's really fascinating to me, because I interviewed one\nof the two archeologists who first found this site\nin the early nineties. And the lead archeologist was\na guy named Klaus Schmidt, and Michael Morsch was\nthe young graduate student who was with him. And Morsch's description\nof like coming upon this like rumored to be site, there was something called\na wishing tree on the site, which I just found so human and perfect that it was this magical\nplace and it was locatable, because there was a\nwishing tree on a hill, and it's where people went to wish and to hope that their wishes came true, I mean, how human is that? And that is where,\nbeneath the wishing tree, kind of like in the shadow\nof the wishing tree, there was a tepe, which is a hill. And beneath that, there\nis the oldest known civilization in the\nworld, 12,000 years ago, a group of hunter\ngatherers built this site, why, we don't know. But I imagined through\nMorsch's descriptions of coming upon, like he tripped on a rock, he told me, he tripped over a stone that turned out to be the top part of a 12,000 year old sculpted man, giant pillar. And he talked about coming upon that, and then no one knows really\nwhat Gobekli Tepe was for. And that makes my mind try and answer the question you asked me internally. Just as like a human who's here on earth for the amount of time I'm here, like if there were a nuclear\nwar, what would it be like? What would it be like when\nsomeone in the future, would we become archeologists one day? Would civilization rebuild? Would we develop computers? Who knows, it's\ninteresting to think about, I hope we never have to. - What would we remember about this time? It is terrifying to think that most of it will be forgotten. Everything we kind of assume\nwill not be forgotten. We think maybe some of the\ntechnological developments will be forgotten, but we assume, like some of history won't be forgotten. But realistically, especially us descending into primitive survival, probably everything\nsince the industrial age will be forgotten, like everything. Maybe some religious ideas will persist, some stories and myths will persist. But like all the wisdom we've gathered, higher level sort of technological\nwisdom would be gone. Like that's terrifying to think about. And like, maybe even, as you touch on, the very fact of nuclear\nwar might be forgotten, like the lessons of nuclear\nwar might be forgotten. That there are these weapons, sort of the obvious elephant in the room would be one of the things\nthat's completely forgotten, or become so vague in the\nrecollection of humans that our understanding will change. It's almost as if a God descended on earth and destroyed everything,\nmaybe that's how it'll persist. Sort of like mythological interpretation of what nuclear weapons are. That's terrifying, 'cause\nthen it could repeat again. - But I think for me, the idea of what is buried becomes very\ninteresting and very human, and in a strange way,\noptimistic and positive. Because if you can\nvisualize that wishing tree, and I have a picture of it in the book from one of the archeologists\nwho work on that. You think, what were they wishing? What were they wishing for? And then you think of your own self, what do I wish for in this world? Because I do think all things come from what happens metaphorically around the dinner table. Like what people put their eyes on becomes interesting and\nexpands what people talk about. And ultimately, when you think\nabout the long arc of time and human civilization,\nit does kind of make you wanna communicate more with your enemies, with your adversaries. And I think about the quote, what Einstein has said to have said, which is that he was asked what weapons World War\nIII would be fought with. And he said, \"I don't know, but I know that World\nWar IV will be fought with sticks and stones.\""

      "text": "- Lemme ask you about the Great Filter. When you look up into our galaxy, into our universe, look up at the sky, do you think there's\nother alien civilizations that are contending with\nsome similar questions? And perhaps the reason we have not definitively seen alien civilizations is because the others have failed to find a solution to this great filter, something like nuclear weapons? - I'm not sure, I'm gonna have\nto think about that question. But what does come to mind is an answer that was given to me similarly, by Ed Mitchell who went to the moon. And he was the sixth\nman to walk on the moon. And so his opinion, I think\nmight count a little more than mine on that subject, because his lens is so much greater. And Mitchell was vilified when he got back from the moon, because it became known that he believed in things like extrasensory perception, and this kind of mystical, metaphysical way of looking at the world. And he really suffered from that, I mean, he was ridiculed and he lost a lot of his career and his friends. But what he said to me in our interview about his trip home from the moon answers that great filter question, I think in a way I might wanna adopt. Which is this, that he said that, as they were returning\nfrom the moon to earth, he looked down at the earth, and I'm paraphrasing him, I write all this in \"Phenomena\", an earlier book, but the paraphrasing is that\nhe looked down from the earth, and it was 1971, and he\nthought about all the conflict going on down below,\nparticularly the Vietnam War where many of his friends were. And then he looked behind\nhim into the great vast galaxy, and he had a moment, he says, that was like an epiphany, like not a near death experience, but a sort of near life experience, where he believed that\nthe human consciousness, which is where so much\nof this thoughtfulness about metaphysics and ESP perhaps come from. Mitchell's theory was\nthat human consciousness, the way to understand\nit had something to do with realizing that man's inner life and man's outer life are deeply connected, in the same way that man\nis connected to the galaxy. And he said it much more eloquently, but you kind of get the idea, and I think it's why humans have always loved to look up. That there's more there, and\nit's a bit like the wish, it's like the big version\nof the wishing tree. What do I wish for, for myself? And what is maybe perhaps\nthe realignment of thinking for those of us in search of happiness, instead of war is, what does it mean to have a conscience, to have consciousness? What does it mean to be a thinking person? What does it mean to be on this earth, to be born, to live, to die? And then there is legacy,\nand so all of those ideas, I think, foster the kind of conversation that deescalates conflict. - Yeah, so in some deep way, so the mysteries of what's out there when we look out to the\nstars are the same mysteries that we find when trying to\nunderstand the human mind. And they're coupled in some way. For me, thinking about alien\ncivilizations out there is really the same kind\nof question, which is, what are we, what is this? What are we doing here? How did we come here? Why does it seem to be so magical and beautiful and powerful? Where's it going? Because it feels like we're really, perhaps the first time in history are in a moment where we\ncan destroy ourselves. And so naturally you ask, well, where's others like us? Is it perhaps, are we inevitably going to a place where\nwe'll destroy ourselves? Is it basically inevitable\nthat we destroy ourselves, we become too powerful? And insufficiently wise to know what to do with that power, But like you said, probably the\nanswers to that are in here. We don't need to look out there."

      "text": "I'd love to ask you about\nthe extrasensory perception. You've written, like you said, the book \"Phenomena\" on the secret history of the US government's investigations into extrasensory perception\nand psychokinesis. What are some of the more\ninteresting extrasensory abilities that were explored by the government, and maybe just in\ngeneral, ESP, what is it? What do you know of it? - The book was so interesting to report, because I spend so much\ntime dealing with like, mechanized systems,\nmachines, war machines, and yet the military\nand intelligence were, and continue to be incredibly interested in the human mind, in consciousness. And so if one is called hard science, this, what we're talking about now is called squishy science. And it was really interesting\nto delve into that world, it just couldn't be farther from weapons and war or could it? And then I really began thinking, well, before science and technology, sort of the supernatural ruled the world, the oracle of Delphi in Greece exists before the common error rulers to go and beg to learn from the powers that be what was going to happen. So all ESP programs, I think, pull from that origin story. The leader's desire to know. And so I really found it amazing that many people think these systems, or rather these programs\nstarted in the seventies, I learned they actually began\nright after World War ii. And that was because, and in my reporting, I find all things sort\nof always circle back to the Third Reich, to the Nazis. The Nazis had a massive occult program, an ESP program, psychokinesis\nprogram, astrology, both Hitler and Himmler\nwere deeply interested in these occult concepts. I learned from records\nat the National Archives that after the war, half of everything went\nto the Soviets Union, and I'm talking about the\ntrove of Nazi documents from which the superpowers were then going to learn to fight future wars, and half of them went\nto the United States. And so we got this trove of documents about all of this, and\nthe Soviets got the other, and so it set off a kind\nof psychic arms race, which in a weird way paralleled\nthe nuclear arms race, which we've been talking about, in as much that it led one side to constantly wonder\nwhat the other side had. - Have they been able to\nfind anything interesting in this squishy science analysis of trying to see how the human mind could be used as a weapon? - The CIA most definitely believed, from my reading of the documents, that there was something very legit, shall we say, about ESP. It was uncontrollable, it was unreliable, but nonetheless it existed. And being the intelligence\nagency that they are, they cared less about why it worked, they just wanted to know\nhow they could use it. And then it got into all kinds of elements of placebo effect. And when the military stepped in and got involved in the programs, that was a complete\ndisaster in my opinion, because the military needs\nto control everything in a mechanized, systematic way. And so they started, for\nexample, teaching people to be psychic, which is a\nreally, really, really bad idea. Flash forward to where we are today, these programs still exist, there's a navy program\nwhich is working on, based on a lot of data\nthat came back from the war on terror with certain soldiers knowing, wait, don't walk down that\npath, there is an IED there. And they call this the spidey sense, and they actually have a\nprogram that works from this. So these things never go away, they kind of circle around in terms of being made fun of and then taken seriously and a little of this and of that. My biggest takeaway from writing that book was a quote that I\nreferenced in the beginning, which is the Thomas theorem, and it says, \"If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.\" - Yeah, I mean, placebo,\nas you've mentioned, is a fascinating concept. By the way, a short plug,\nI started listening to it, Andrew Huberman just released a podcast on placebo, the placebo effect. - Does he know the\norigin story of placebo? We'll have to ask him. - We'll have to ask him.\n- But, are you ready for this? CIA.\n(Lex laughing) And not only that, I can tell\nyou that Dr. Henry Beecher, Harvard, I think he was\nalso at MIT for a bit, he came up with that term, and you might even say for the CIA. - Does that trouble you\nthat so much of this is coming from the CIA first? - You mean the placebo concept or the- - The placebo concept, but a lot of the sort of\nscientific investigations. - Listen, I have such mixed\nfeelings about the CIA, as one should, I think you\nshould have mixed feelings about anything that you\ncover as a reporter, or as a human, and maybe change that from mixed to conflicting. Because there are really positive elements of every organization within\nthe federal government. I mean, my first learning about the CIA came from the work I did\non the \"Area 51\" book about their aerial\nreconnaissance programs, which were set up, again,\nto prevent World War iii. Nuclear World War iii, it was this idea that information was king. The U-2 spy plane was\ndeveloped out at Area 51, and I interviewed Hervey Stockman, the first man to fly over\nthe Soviet Union in a U-2. Gathered all this\nintelligence, prevented wars. Later I wrote a book about\nthe CIA's paramilitary, \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\". So like, just when I was thinking, wow, the CIA is doing all this amazing non-kinetic activity with\naerial reconnaissance, then you learn about their kill programs, and that's a whole\ndifferent set of issues. - It turns out, as you write in that book, that the CIA assassinates\npeople sometimes, and we'll talk about it. But anyway, like you said,\nconflicting feelings. - I mean, I work with\nsources to report my books, and so put yourself in my shoes. I interview for dozens\nor hundreds of hours, my primary sources, in the case of the \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\" book, I traveled with Billy Waugh, the longest serving CIA operator, back to the scene of the crime, back to the battle, we went\nto Hanoi, we went to Havana. And you really get to know someone, and that's when I say conflicting, I work with sources on a real trust basis, and sometimes people will\ntell me things, they'll say, \"Annie, this is off the record, this is for you to know about me on deep background because I\nwant you to know who I am.\" And that's powerful, and a\nlot of times it's personal, it's personal, it's about\ntheir personal life. And it isn't apropos to\nwhat I'm writing about, but I need to know that,\nand that's where it gets conflicted, because you, in a good way, because you realize where we're all such creatures of our personal lives. So you have a professional life where your national\nsecurity are in your hands. I don't know what that is like. - I wonder if you could\njust speak to that. You've interviewed so\nmany powerful people, so many fascinating people. And as you've spoken about, trust is fundamental to that. So they open up and really\nshow you into their world. What does it take to do that? - I think willingness, we were talking about trust earlier, I have to trust that there's a reason I find myself in a certain situation. Otherwise, it would just be a constant doubt paradox, why am I\nhere, what am I doing? And so I trust that I'm going to learn something of value. And so I'm willing to listen, I really am willing to listen. And so far it's always proven, the expectations I might have going into something are dwarfed by the outcome, because people are so interesting, and because the people that I interview, because I write about war, and weapons, and national security,\nand government secrets, and the people I interview are\nat the heart of all of this. I mean, they are really capable people, intellectually brilliant,\nphysically capable. They go so far out on the\nlimb to do their jobs. And by the way, the reason\nthey're talking to me is 'cause they're still alive, and so many of their colleagues are dead. So it gives them also a wisdom about life, about sacrifice, not in cliched, sort of nationalistic\njingoistic terms whatsoever. I'm talking like real, real, what is their real truth? When I went to Vietnam with Billy Waugh, I mean, so much of it was, the details are just, every detail, I mean, starting with the fact that he showed up at my house\nwith a giant suitcase and a bunch of clothes, dry cleaning, pressed clothes in plastic\nhangers, carrying them. I'm like, \"Billy, we're going to Vietnam and we're going back into the jungle to find the Oscar Eight battle site, like, what are you carrying?\" And he got really mad at me, he did not like anyone correcting him. And I got my husband on the job, like, Kevin, you gotta sort this out. And what transpired was that Billy Waugh had never taken a trip\nfor personal reasons. He operated, I think in 62 countries, every single time for the CIA. And it would go like this, Billy, go to there and get to there. And that's what he would\ndo, and when he arrived, whatever he needed, he would just get. It's not a fashion trip, so he had no idea how to\npack for an overseas trip, this was like, oh my God, how can you not have the hugest smile on your face going into this? I'm with a guy who's 89 years\nold, he's got eight bullet, he's had eight purple hearts from Vietnam. I mean, he operated\nagainst Osama Bin Laden 10 years before 9/11. He went after Bin Laden in\nAfghanistan when he was 72. And he went after Kadafi\nduring the Arab Spring when he was 82, and now here\nhe is with me going Hanoi. The details, those human details. But my husband repacked his bag, and got him a proper\nsuitcase that was carryable and small and didn't have the hangers, he wasn't trailing the hangers, but it was the trip home in the taxi that I got at this really big reveal. Billy reached into that\nsmall suitcase my husband had given him and pulled out\na rolled up American flag. And he had taken this flag, 'cause I had tried to help him\npack and he wouldn't let me, and I just thought it was like\nan old guy being stubborn, but he didn't want me to see that he was bringing an\nAmerican flag to Vietnam, which is not legal. And he wanted to bring that flag and take it around everywhere with him, as he explained to me later,\nto honor all of his friends who died there 50 years ago. And then when the trip was finished, he gave me that flag\nand it's in my office. And that's the kind of\nrelationship that you can develop with people as a reporter\nif you're willing to go the extra mile\nwith them, to trust them, that they'll tell you things of value. And to me, something\nlike that is as of value as any secret mission I'm\nable to get declassified, because we are a nation of people. - And probably there's\na bunch of human details that you can't possibly express in words, things left unspoken, but\nyou saw in the silence, exchange between the\ntwo of you, the sadness. Maybe you could see on his\nface, looking back at memories of the people he is lost,\nall that kind of stuff. - All that kind of stuff."

      "text": "- You mentioned you\nwrote a book on Area 51, for people who don't know, you've written a lot about security, the military, secrets,\nall of this kind of stuff. So Area 51 is one of the legendary centers of all of these kinds of topics. So high level first is, what is Area 51 as you understand it,\nas you've written about, the lore and the reality? - I think everybody wants\nto know about Area 51, because it's like this American enigma. It's like to some people\nit's the Shangri-La of testbed aerospace programs. And to others, it's the\nplace of captured aliens, and everything in between. I had the great fortune\nof interviewing 75 people who lived and worked at that base for extended periods of time. Mostly leading up to the nineties, because everything since\nthen is classified. So things get declassified after decades, not everything, but some, and that allows you to\npiece together stories. - So you talked to a lot of\npeople that worked there. What can you describe as the history of technological development\nthat went on there? - I mean, Area 51 is huge by the way, and it's a top secret military facility inside a top secret military facility, inside the Nevada test and training range, which is this massive,\nnot secret facility. So you're just talking about layers, talk about peeling the onion in reverse, and it began as a place\nto test the U-2 spy plane. And literally, the CIA set up shop there to build this plane away from the public eye. And then that led to\nanother espionage platform called the A-12 Oxcart, which is, anyone who's seen the X-Men movies knows about the SR-71,\nand that's a two-seater. And before that, there\nwas the A-12 Oxcart, and that was the CIA's\nstealth mock three spy plane. Think about that in the early 1960s, it's astonishing, and I\ninterviewed the pilots who flew it. - What did they say about it? What was it like?\n- Oh my God. I mean, look, I describe\nin detail in \"Area 51\", but also the amazing thing,\nLex, about that was that, and I just look back on\nthat with such fondness, this is like in 2009 when\nI was reporting that, and many of the guys who\nwere in their eighties and nineties were World War II heroes, like serious World War II\nheroes, like Colonel Slater, who was the commander of Area\n51, he flew the U-2 on the, the missions called\nthe Black Cat missions, over China in the early 1960s to see about their Lop\nNur nuclear facility. So all of these things tie\nin when you're reporting on military and intelligence programs, but these guys had been\nWorld War II heroes, and then were given this\ncushy job out at Area 51, and it just came with all these perks. Colonel Slater told me this\none perk, I just love so much, they all had a hankering\nfor lobster one day. And here they are in the\nmiddle of the desert in Nevada, and they have these really fast planes, and they literally called,\nlike they arranged, they didn't take the\nOxcart out for that one, but they got some lobsters\nfrom Massachusetts, like delivered to them\nin like record time, they didn't even need to put them on ice. And again, those are these\ndetails where you're like, thank God, at least for me,\nthank God I got these details, these guys are all passed now. - So there's a lot of\nincredible technological work"

      "section": "UFOs and aliens",
      "text": "going on there, so the legend, the lore, like you said, aliens, were there ever aliens in\nArea 51 as you understand it? - So I've interviewed hundreds of people. - That worked there. - Well, not just at Area 51, but in all the different national security and military intelligence\nand intelligence programs. And I personally have no reason to believe that aliens have ever visited earth, that's just me personally.\n- Visited earth, period. - I have no information that causes me to\nconclude that's the case. Now, with that said, many\nof the primary players in this present day, there are aliens among us narrative, are\nin my \"Phenomena\" book, I continue to communicate\nwith a lot of these people. I'm talking about astrophysicists, who fundamentally believe that\nthere are aliens among us. So we beg to differ on that issue. - But for you, in terms of doing research on government agencies that do top secret military work,\nI mean, they would know. So you have interviewed a lot of people at every layer of the onion. You don't see evidence or a reason to believe\nthat there was ever aliens or UFOs captured from out of this world? - That is correct, and even\nperhaps more important, and perhaps this colors my thinking, but I am uniquely familiar\nwith disinformation programs put forth by the CIA, or the agency as it's called by insiders. And I've learned firsthand\nabout these program, or rather learned from\nfirsthand participants in strategic deception\ncampaigns that the CIA has engaged in, beginning with Area 51. The idea that all these reports of this U-2 spy plane, this giant, long winged aircraft\nflying 70,000 feet up, people didn't think airplanes\ncould fly that high, and it's the sun shining off of it, it looked like a UFO, and\nall the reports coming in, and the CIA opened up a UFO disinformation campaign office, headed by a guy named Toto Otirenco, specifically for this reason. Now, does that mean\nthat every UFO sighting in the world has been a U-2? No, but I come from it\nfrom that lane of thinking, and there are so many\nstrategic deception campaigns, and as I look over the decades of how these same UFO stories, and again, this is just my\nopinion based on my reporting, this narrative that keeps reoccurring, it seems to me like a very large catchall to keep the public's attention\non that, not on that. - So to you, sexy stories like UFOs are going to be leveraged by the CIA\nfor strategic deception? - 100%, I mean, Google Paul Bennewitz, I'm always amazed that\nPaul Bennewitz' story is not more widely spoken of. And I think that's because people, there's like the sort of\nufologists or the people who are like absolutely convinced\nthat aliens are among us, and I use that term loosely,\nbut you know what I mean, and then there's the,\nquote unquote, \"skeptics\", and the skeptics tend to be\nsort of like self-righteous. And I would never wanna be self-righteous, so I'm not a skeptic, I'm just agnostic I suppose. But Google Paul Bennewitz, and you can learn the story of that man, who thought he saw a UFO in\nthe seventies, early eighties, and the Air Force, because the Air Force intelligence community works\nhand in glove with CIA a lot, and some of the other\nintelligence agencies, of course, there's 17, not just the CIA, and they destroyed Paul Bennewitz, they sent him to a mental institution, by pulling a massive\nstrategic deception campaign against him because they\ndidn't want him to know about the technology that he was seeing at Kirkland Air Force Base. So look that up, and\nthen you go, oh my God, and to my eye, you can apply any of these other names,\nsubstitute in Paul Bennewitz, or any of the current individuals who really become convinced of X, Y, or Z, when in fact there's a strategic deception campaign going on. - Yeah, there's a lot\nof incentive for the CIA and other intelligence agencies to get you to look the other way on whatever, well, whatever is happening. Plus, from a enemy perspective, whenever two nations are at war, to try to create hysteria in the other. - But then you have the Thomas theorem that becomes applicable there too. If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences. So this idea of like UFOs and we're being lied to, it becomes real to many people. And then that creates a\nwhole subset of problems, to the point where things\nare spiraling out of control. And there is no center anymore, so a lot of people that\nare briefed on programs maybe aren't even aware of their position within a greater campaign. Or I'm wrong and there\nare aliens among us. - Right, so I appreciate you, the possibility of acknowledging\nthat you might be wrong. From everything you know\nabout the US government, if there was an alien spacecraft, like what do you think would happen? Would they be able to hold onto those secrets for decades? Like, would they want to\nhold onto those secrets? Like what would they do? What's your sense? - I can't imagine that kind of exciting situation not\nbecoming public information. And the counter to that is this, which is, this is a very strong argument for why this is a big strategic\ndeception campaign. Think about the Defense Department, think about how jealously\nthey guard its airspace. I mean, you had a Chinese\nballoon flying over and the whole world went crazy. It was front page news. So the fact that one element, or a couple people in\nthe Defense Department have made this statement,\nwe've lost control of our airspace, over this UFO, alleged UFO craft that they can't explain. I don't buy that at all. Zero.\n- But of course it's possible that it is alien\nspacecraft, if it is that, and they operate under\na very different set of technologically capabilities in theory. - In my interviews with Jacques Vallee, who is the kind of\ngrandfather of all ufology, and he's such an interesting person and has such a really unique origin story about how he came into all of this, and he's such a scientist. And he is profoundly\ndedicated to this issue and stands completely on the opposite end of the spectrum from\nme, and knows a lot more and has studied this for decades more, but what he said to me is\nthe most interesting thing, which is that, \"It's\nnot a military problem, it's an intelligence problem.\" Because Jacques believes that this is some kind of intelligence, which really, the closest I can do to wrapping my head around that takes me to consciousness, the idea of what is consciousness. And I think that's where it\nbecomes very interesting. I think the government is\nhiding bodies and crafts is very Paul Bennewitz,\nread it, Google it, look into it.\n(Lex laughing) - Yeah, I think this kind\nof flying saucer thing is a trivialization of, if there's alien civilizations out there. - Trivialization, that's a great word, trivialization, I agree with you. - I tend to believe that there is, like a very large number of\nalien civilizations out there. And I believe we would\nhave trouble comprehending what that even looks\nlike, were they to visit. I tend to believe they are\nalready here or have visited and were too dumb to understand\nwhat that even means. And they certainly would not appear as flying objects to defy\ngravity for brief moments of time on low resolution video. I tend to have humility\nabout all this kind of stuff, but I think radical humility\nis required to even like, open your eyes to what\nan alien intelligence would actually look like. And to me, it's beyond\nmilitary applications, it's like the basic\nhuman question of like, what is even this thing, like you mentioned\nconsciousness that's going on. Like where does this come from? Why is it so powerful? Is it unique in the universe? I tend to believe not, of course, I hang out a bunch with other folks, like Elon who believe we are alone, but I think that belief, just like you said, has power, because it actually manifests itself in reality, so if you\nbelieve that we're alone in this universe, that's a great motivator to build rockets and\nbecome multi-planetary and save ourselves, especially\nin the case of nuclear war. Because otherwise whatever\nthe special sauce, this flame of consciousness will go out if we destroy ourselves on this earth. And for people like Elon,\nit's too high of a probability that we destroy ourselves on earth not to try to become multi-planetary. In your book on Area 51,\nyou propose an explanation"

      "text": "that I think some people have\ncriticized at the very end, that this might have been a\ndisinformation campaign from, I guess Stalin, that the Roswell incident was a remotely piloted\nplane with a, quote, \"grotesque child size aviator.\" Just looking back at all\nthat now, years later, what's the probability that it's true? What's the probability it's not? - So I've never revealed to that sources. - Yes.\n- Did you know that? - I knew.\n- You want me to tell you? - What the source?\n- Yeah. - Okay, who was the source? - So before I say anything on that, let me speak to the\nquestion that you asked. So what you asked me,\nwhat's the probability that that is still standing as an idea, 12, 13, 14 years later. So I continued to work with that source for years afterwards,\nwe talked about this, look, I mean, his whole family knew it was him, and I knew his family, 'cause I was an integral part of, I was at his house, met\nall his kids, grandkids. - And we should say the source\nis the main expert advisor behind the story that it\nwas, maybe you can explain what the story is that\nyou report in the book, that it was a disinformation campaign created by Stalin to cause mass hysteria in the United States. - Yes.\n- That's the very kind that we've been speaking\nabout with the CIA and so on. - Yes, predicated on the narrative of the \"War of the Worlds\". And the \"War of the Worlds\",\nwhen it was a radio program in the United States,\nmade people go crazy, oh my God, we're being invaded by aliens. Well, the government was always\ninterested in this story, and Joseph Stalin was too, we know that from declassified documents. And so the source told me that the reason for this program and that the real Roswell\ncrash remains were, in fact, it was a black propaganda\nhoax infiltrated, or rather predicated at this idea that you were gonna overwhelm\nAmerica's early warning air defense system, cause mayhem, and maybe be able to\nattack the United States. That was the plan, and\nStalin was also messing with the United States,\nmessing with Truman, who sort of turned his\nback on him at Potsdam. And the reason that the\nsource is important, and unlike a lot of people,\nI saw this, I saw that, I learned that, was\naccording to the source, once it was determined\nthat this was a hoax and that Stalin was able to get a craft over the United States and it crashed, and it had people inside of it, they were people that\nwere sort of deformed and meant surgically\naltered to look like aliens, the United States government\ndecided that it needed to know what on earth that was all about, and if it was possible for\nus to have the same program. This according to the source. And so it sounds preposterous, and if it was just someone saying, you might say, well, it's ridiculous, get them onto another subject. But the difference was, is this source, who is very well placed and friends with all of the other 75 people, told me this as a confession. A real tearful confession, because what he said is he was involved in the American program\nto do the same thing, and people died because there were human experiments that went on. And I write about this in the\nlast 12 pages of \"Area 51\", it was a explosive revelation, and I felt very confident in writing this because the source wanted it written, why? Because he said, \"I'm\ndedicated to my country. I know about being committed\nto national security, and this kind of thing must never happen. And if you give people too much power, they would take advantage of it.\" And he wanted it on the record. And his wife of 60 years did not know until after the book published,\nnor did his children. So after the book published,\nI was called to his house and sat there with his family, and they said, \"Tell us this isn't true.\" And he said, \"It is true.\" Now, that source is Al O'Donnell, who is the nuclear weapons engineer who armed, wired, and fired 186 nuclear weapons. So if you wanna talk about somebody.\n- Ah. - And you're the first person\nI've told that on the record, but it's kind of about time. - Wow, well, you received a lot of criticism over this story and it confused me why, because given the context of\neverything you've described with the CIA and other\nintelligence agencies, it is reasonable that such\na action would be taken. - And the source is\nextraordinarily credible. If you wanted to take the position, well, that person isn't very reliable, then you have to ask\nyourself, why did they have top secret clearances\nthat are higher than any in the United States whatsoever? Because he was responsible\nfor arming nuclear bombs. He was called the trigger man. And by the way, he told\nme that I could tell the world who he was. There's a lot of details\nthat are really dark involving that program. And when is it appropriate? Well, it feels appropriate\nnow, first of all, 'cause you and I have been\ntalking for several hours, so this is what is a truly\na long form conversation, and it's the outcome of a very long time of my reporting, and also being judicious about closing the loop on that. Because I do think it's important for people to know that sources have revelations. - And like you said, the programs, both on the Soviet side\nand the American side, conflicting, I think is the\nterm we used previously, ethically, morally on all fronts. People have done some horrible things in the name of security."

      "section": "CIA assassinations",
      "text": "In your book, \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\", you write about the CIA and the so-called\nPresident's third option. It turns out, so first of all, first option being diplomacy, and second option being war. So when diplomacy is inadequate\nand war's a terrible idea we would go to the third option. And this third option\nis about covert action and it's about assassination. So how much of that does the CIA do? - That is open to debate. We know from the historical record that the CIA was heavily involved in assassination during the\nCold War, that's non-negotiable. Even the names of the programs that were assigned to\nperform assassinations are fascinating and now declassified, like Eisenhower's, for example, was the health alteration committee. - Well, at least to have a sense of humor to this dark topic. - Then the more modern\nnames are targeted killing. Executive action, targeted killing. I mean, drone striking is\nessentially assassination. And people jump up and down and say that's not true, well, I spent quite a long time interviewing the CIA's lead council, John\nRizzo, he died recently. But Rizzo was very forthcoming with me, of course, never sharing\nclassified information, but going up to the edge of\nwhat can legally be known. Rizzo was thrown under the bus by sort of the general public for, he was the fall guy for\nthe torture campaign, the CIA calls it enhanced interrogation. And so Rizzo had this long career, he began working under\nthe Carter administration, and was responsible for the torture memos, was responsible for legally making sure the president's ass was covered, and then got thrown under the bus. And so he was very forthcoming,\nnot in a bitter way, but in a very earnest way about a lot of how these programs\nare made to be legal, because if the president\nof the United States says they're legal, they're legal. Executive Order 12333, it says we don't assassinate, but it can be overwritten\nby another order, that's straight out of Rizzo's mouth. Also really important to keep in mind is that the military operates under what's called Title 50. It's part of the National\nSecurity Code that gives, like, sort of rules et cetera, how you must behave in a war theater. Well, the CIA is under no such rules, it operates under what's called Title 50. And it's interesting to me as a reporter, 'cause before I wrote the book and reported openly about Title 50, it was not really discussed, and now you even see operators\nthemselves on podcast talking about Title 50,\nwhich is kind of great, because it's like the\ncat's out of the bag guys, that's what it's called,\nand that's how it works, it means what we say goes. - Can you elaborate on what Title 50, so it basically says\nassassination is allowed? - It says what the president wants, the president gets. And so, I mean, the best example is the killing of Bin Laden. We were not at war with Pakistan,\nso Title 50 doesn't apply, you can't have a military\noperation in a country you're not at war with. I mean the lines, my God,\nnow they've really blurred, but even then they were\na little more honored. And so what do you do? Well, Leon Panetta was the CIA director, and you work out a scenario whereby the Seals, and by the way, there was a rotational on\nthat killer capture mission, which was really just a kill mission. Seals were practicing,\nDelta was practicing, and Special Activities\ndivision was practicing. They were all practicing\nat a secret facility in North Carolina. And it was just like, they're ready until they get the go order, and it just happened to be the Seals. So the Seals operate under Title 10. So they had to get, what\nI call sheep dipped, because that's what the insiders call it, and that is a term that\ncomes from, interestingly, Area 51, the U-2 pilots\nwere Air Force pilots, they needed to be sheep\ndipped over to the CIA, so they could do things\nthat defied the law. So you can see how these all entwined and you become more and more\ninformed and you go, aha. So that's how Title 50 worked. So the night of that mission,\nit was a CIA mission, because the CIA is allowed\nto go into Pakistan and kill someone, and the military can't. - That's fascinating, so people talk about the Navy Seals doing it, but it's really, legally speaking to get\nthe permission to do it within the whole legal framework of the United States, it was the CIA. - And if you look at their\nuniforms that they were wearing, and now that you know this, oh, you'll see, there's no\nnomenclature on them. So they're just meant to\nbe completely untraceable, were they to be shot down and captured, it's like, wait, who are these guys? Oh, a bunch of rogue guys. And this goes back, the\norigin story of all that is in Vietnam with MACV-SOG, and these cross border operations that I chronicle in\n\"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\", which still amaze me to this day. I mean, SOG missions, they\ncalled it suicide on the ground, 'cause that's what it was. And these guys had no identifiable, nothing, I mean, they were\nessentially in pajamas. Even their weapons were\nespecially designed by the CIA to have no\nserial numbers, no nothing. So if they were captured\nand they became POWs, I don't know who these guys are. - What do you think, and\nhow much do they think at the highest levels of power, about the ethics of assassination and about the role of that in geopolitics and military operations? Like to you maybe also, does assassination make sense as a good methodology of war? - I mean, again, I try to remain\nagnostic on the policy part of it and just report the\noperator's perspective. Because this is what people do, and this is what people are asked to do. And it depends on the individual, I mean, Billy Waugh went\non a lot of those missions, I mean the saying is like, oh, Billy Waugh, he killed\nmore people than cancer. Did Billy Waugh ever tell me\nabout direct assassinations? No, because they're all classified. Did he tell me about some failed ones? Yes, I'll give you an example,\nit's really interesting. He would show me these PowerPoints that were just fantastic,\nlate in his life, he was constantly being\nasked to go up to Fort Bragg and lecture to the young soldiers, and everybody loved him. And he would drive all night to get there and he would create these PowerPoints, and then he would show me the PowerPoints, all unclassified, but at one point, when Hugo Chavez was in power, Billy Waugh was kind of\nasked, that's how it works, like, if you had to think\nabout doing something, what would it look like,\nlet's just say hypothetically. So he took me through this\nPowerPoint that never happened, whereby he and a group of operators, agency operators were gonna HALO jump in to the palace and grab\nChavez and probably kill him, 'cause he wouldn't allow\nhimself to be captured. And by the way, HALO\njumping, for those listeners who don't know, high\naltitude, low opening. So you jump out of an aircraft, and you go down like a pencil\nuntil you're really low to the deck, like 1,000 feet,\nyou pull your parachute cord, and that way you're\nnot picked up on radar, and you're also not traceable\nwhen you get to the ground, 'cause it's so fast. Billy Waugh took the second HALO jump in history into a war theater in Laos during the Vietnam War. So he's like this famous HALO jumper. So he and the team were\ngonna go in, grab Chavez, and he said to me a very interesting thing that was kind of\na one moment in time where I saw a different side\nof Billy Waugh, where he said, \"I'm so glad we didn't do that, even though I really\nwanted to at the time.\" Because can you imagine that country's problems where it is now? Can you imagine how we\nwould have been blamed? And it was like, an interesting\nrare moment for Billy Waugh to comment on the bigger picture that you're asking me about. I think pretty much the operators I know, they just stick to the mission. - So in the technical\ndifficulty of those missions, just your big sense, how\nhard is it to assassinate, to assassinate a target on\nthe soil of that nation? - I suppose that just depends. All right, here's another insightful thing Billy Waugh said to me, and\nI'm answering the question around because I don't\nknow, because again, I never had anyone say to\nme, here's how it went down. Because you can't, that would be, first of all, those are classified, so I'm never gonna receive\nclassified information. I did hear a lot about\nreconnaissance missions when people would be in charge of, you have to be able to,\nwhat's called make book, on the target before. And making book on the target\nmeans photographing them, then that gets run up the chain of command to make sure this is really Imad Mughniyeh we're about to kill. But I once asked Billy, when I was trying to get the question and\nhe wouldn't answer it, and I said, so there's\nanother person in my book named Rick Proto, who's also\nlike a legendary agency guy, he's like 20 years younger than Billy. And I said, \"Billy, if you and Rick had to kill\neach other, like who would win?\" I was trying to imagine\nthis like hypothetical, like how would that work, who would win? And I posed the question to each of them. And of course, each of them said me. Then I went back to them and Billy said, \"Let me tell you how I would win.\" And he said, \"I'd cheat. I'd show up before the\ndual and I'd kill him.\" - I have a lot of friends\nwho were Navy Seals, it's such a guy conversation. - Well, you would be amazed\nat what the women do, let me just tell you that. Women are part of the\nspecial activities division, a big part of it. - Can you comment on that? - I can, women can get a hell\nof a lot closer to a target. And I mean that literally. - The special operations, do you mean, is this part of the CIA? - The special activities division, now it's called the\nSpecial Activity Center, but originally, that's the umbrella agency that has the different paramilitary\norganizations under it. So the most lethal one is ground branch. And that's what I reported on\nin \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\", and its origins go way back\nto the Guerrilla Warfare Corps that was started in\n1947 for the president. - So women are also a part of the alleged assassination? - Absolutely. - And you're saying they can, at times be more effective. I'm just gonna leave that pause there. The reason I ask of how\ndifficult the assassinations are, with Bin Laden, it took a long time. So I guess the reconnaissance,\nthe intelligence for finding the target,\nI imagine with Mossad, maybe the CIA now, the\nleadership of Hamas, or the military branch of Hamas is much wanted from a\nassassination perspective. So to me as an outside observer, it seems like it's more\ndifficult than you would imagine, but perhaps that's the\nintelligence aspect of it, not the actual assassination\nof locating the person. - Well, I think it's because\nmostly from what I understand, it's a really dirty game and\npeople are covering for people. And I'll give you the\nexample of Billy Waugh and Imad Mughniyeh, if I may. So Imad Mughniyeh was\nthe most wanted terrorist in the world before Bin Laden, Hezbollah's chief of operations. And he was wanted by every, Mossad, John down, but\nno one could find him, he was missing for 20 years, there wasn't even a photograph of him. And then he resurfaced, and of all places he\nresurfaced in Saudi Arabia. That's when I say it's a dirty game, Hezbollah, Iran, Hezbollah, Iran, enemies with Saudi Arabia. Why on earth was Imad\nMughniyeh in Saudi Arabia? Well, that's where he\nwas, there was a Navy Seal who was doing reconnaissance on him, this is according to Billy\nWaugh, and this is around 2005. So Billy's in his eighties at this point, late seventies, eighties. And he gets word that the Seal who has been tracking Mughniyeh\nto get photographs of him to give the photographs to Mossad and CIA so they can do a joint\noperation to kill him, which they did with a\ncar bomb in Damascus, that's the end of the\nstory, but how we got there was the CIA needed confirmation, you can't kill the wrong person. So the Seal panicked,\naccording to Billy Waugh, and was just like, I'm outta\nhere, this is too dangerous, and I do not wanna wind\nup in a Saudi prison. So who do you send in? Billy Waugh, he shows up, he's there for 24 hours, he knows where Mughniyeh\nlives from the Seal. He positions himself in\na cafe across the street, which is run by Sudanese men, and of course Waugh speaks some Sudanese because he operated in Sudan. And he's shooting the shit\nwith him, by his own words, he had the most foul mouth that was just absolutely\ndelightful to listen to. And then in between him and\nMughniyeh's house is a dumpster. And Billy Waugh being Billy Waugh, who will go to any lengths to do the job, decides to conduct reconnaissance from inside the dumpster. And that is where he is\nwhen he takes the picture of Imad Mughniyeh, living\nso comfortably in Saudi that Mughniyeh came, according to Billy, came out of his a apartment building with dry cleaner plastic bag\nhangers over his shoulder. That's how comfortable, he lived there. It was his neighborhood. Click, click, click, Billy\nWaugh takes the photographs, runs 'em to the CIA headquarters\nin Saudi at the embassy, oh my God, it's Mughniyeh,\nget the hell out of here, he gets to the airport, he leaves. Those photographs get sent to the agency, and then they do the\noperation with Mossad, and Mughniyeh is dead. Now the truth about that\nbeing a co CIA mission was not reported for many\nyears after the fact. Mossad took credit as the CIA often likes to just give other people credit. They just want the job done. - Well, speaking of Mossad,\nwhat in your understanding of all the intelligence agencies, what are the strengths and weaknesses of the different intelligence\nagencies out there? CIA, Mossad, MI6, SVR, and FSB, and Chinese Intelligence, all this kind of stuff. Is there some interesting differences, insights that you have from\nall your studying of CIA? - That's a really interesting question. I don't know, and here's why, it's because I've never interviewed any intelligence officer\nwith those other agencies. I've interviewed a couple people with Shin Bet in Israel. But until I speak to an actual source whose job it was, I don't know. And so the information that I'm getting is based on perception of others, which one would think\nwould be deeply clouded by the idea that America's the greatest. (Lex giggles) - [Lex] Right, right. - We're better than them. - Yes, well, actually\nthe fascinating thing is, 'cause you've spoken to a\nlot of people about the CIA, how do you know they're telling the truth? And this actually\nprobably applies generally to your interviews with\nvery secretive people. How do you get past the bullshit? - Well, that's just\nlike multiple sourcing. So you find the story\nout and then you have to, you go to the national archives,\nand you find the operation, and then you learn all about this, and then you interview\nother people who were there, and you put the story together\nto the best of your ability, and you make very specific\nchoices with quote, so and so said, end quote, said so and so. And very rarely do I\nreport on a single source, as I did in the end of Area 51, and then it says essentially, look, dear reader, this is\nwhat the source told me, I have no way of corroborating it, this is legit and here it is. So that's an area to make\nyour reader comfortable with the information\nthat they're being given. And then in all of my books, whether there are three or 400 pages, there's always 100 pages\nof notes at the end. So you can see all the sourcing, and you can begin to get an understanding of how journalism in the\nnational security world works. And also great opportunity for me to say, I'm often standing on the\nshoulders of journalists before me who did an incredible\njob digging into something and being able to report what they knew. Often the books are 10, 20, 30 years old, and so much more has come to light since. - And I also would just like\nto say that I appreciate that you said great\nquestion, I don't know. Not enough people say I don't know, and that's a sign of a great journalist. But speaking about things\nyou might not know about, (Lex giggling)"

      "text": "let me ask you about\nsomething going on currently. So recently, Alexei Navalny died in prison, perhaps\nwas killed in prison. What's your sense from looking at it? Do you think he died of\nnatural causes in prison? Do you think it's possible\nhe was assassinated? Russia, Ukraine, Mossad, CIA, whoever has interest\nin this particular war? - For that, I look directly\nto the historical record. Having written about Russian\nassassination campaigns and programs since the\nearliest days of the Cold War. And Russia has a long history of assassinating, murdering dissidents. And in \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\", I tell the story of an actual KGB assassin named Khokhlov, who knocked on the door of the man he was assigned to kill. And by the way, this all comes from a book that Khokhlov wrote later, because he defected to the United States, he knocks on the door, and\nthe guy answers the door, and instead of killing him,\nhe has like this moment of conscious of crisis,\nor crisis of conscience, and says like, \"I can't kill you, even though that's what\nI'm supposed to do.\" And then sits down with the guy and together decides,\nokay, we're gonna defect, we're gonna let the Western\nintelligence agencies know what we're doing here. And the CIA got involved, but Russian assassins were able to poison Khokhlov with polonium, what happens to him is insane and it's a miracle he\ndidn't die, but he doesn't, and then he defects to the West and he writes these books, and he tells lots of incredible secrets\nabout the Russian assassination programs and their poison labs, and they're really,\nreally, really interesting. And so to answer that question, I mean, to my eye, of course, I don't know, but it certainly looks\nlike Russia is acting in the same vein that it has always acted, taking care of dissidents\nthat go against Mother Russia. - So in the style of KGB assassinations."

      "text": "Is there something you can comment on about the ways that KGB\noperates versus the CIA when we look at the history\nof the two organizations, the Cold War, after World War II, and the leading up to today? - I mean, my feeling\non that is always that there's a thread somewhere in declassified documentation about these programs of America working to maintain a semblance of democratic ideals. However surprising that may be. In other words, always trying to, I don't wanna say fight fair, because killing people isn't fair, but versus a certain ruthlessness, a real sinister, totalitarian type ruthlessness, certainly from Soviet Russia. I'm far less familiar with modern day Russian assassination activities, although we certainly know on\nthe record that they exist. Some people have done\ngreat reporting on that. But there seems to be a kind of, almost a sadism about the Russian programs that I personally have not\nseen in the American programs. - What about on the surveillance side? It seems like America's pretty\ngood at mass surveillance, or at least has been revealed through NSA and all this kind of reporting, and leaks, and whistleblowers. Can you comment to the degree\nto how much surveillance is done by the US government,\ninternally and externally? - If you'd asked me five years ago, I would've a very different answer, first of all, they're looking\nfor a needle in the haystack, they're looking for the Bin Laden, and they can't find the\nneedle in the haystack, but they continue to create the haystack and survey the haystack. But the real problem, what has happened, and I write about this in\nmy book, \"First Platoon\", which is about a group of young soldiers who goes to Afghanistan and\nunwittingly becomes part of the Defense Department's biome efforts to capture biometrics on 85% of the population of Afghanistan. Which, by the way, China then emulated in their own biometric\nsurveillance program. And I think this is a terrible idea, but what has happened,\nthese biometric systems that have been created, and biometrics are of course fingerprints, facial images, DNA, and IRIS scans,\nthat allow you to tag, track, and locate people. And what has happened in the five years since this question was\nfirst on everybody's minds about NSA surveillance, is\nthat the civilian sector companies have essentially done all the Defense Department's biometric surveillance job for them. By all of us sharing our\nfacially recognizable images on Instagram, and Facebook,\nand everywhere else, X, by sharing information,\nby writing up narratives about ourselves, this\ninformation has become part of the database. Five years ago when I was\nreporting First Platoon, I was interviewing the\npolice chief of El Segundo, which is kind of like\non the outskirts of LA, it's right near the airport. And why it's important is 'cause it's like defense contractor haven. So they have like massive surveillance. And Chief Whalen, when I\nposed this question to him, he said to me, \"Annie, let\nme show you something.\" And he had Clearwater AI, the recognition software on his phone. And this was still when it was like, quasi not supposed to have to, you have that for law enforcement, and he said, \"I want\nyou to go down the block and I want you to just turn the corner and come back toward me.\" Which I did. And he just didn't even hold up his phone, it looked like his hand\nand his phone was on me. And he went back down, it was\nlike the tiniest movement. And when I came back to\nhim, he went like this and he showed me, there I\nwas, everything about me, everything about me, facts, and figures, and all images. And he knew who I was\nbefore I even got to him. So is that a good thing or a bad thing? I mean, we could have another three hour conversation about that alone. - So you're saying more and\nmore you don't need an NSA where we're giving over the data ourselves publicly or semi publicly? - Yeah, during the War on terror, people were just like incensed to learn that there's a drone that's flying at something like 20,000\nfeet, it's called ARGUS-IS. And it can capture, it's not a license plate, it's like, it can basically capture\nwhat's written on a golf ball from 17,000 feet, 20,000 feet up. And people went crazy over this, like, oh my God, it's Big Brother. Well, one of the lead engineers on that, Pat Bilgin, is someone\nI talk to regularly, because we talk about surveillance a lot, 'cause he thinks about it a\nlot 'cause he has kids now. And he has given so much thoughtful, really thinks about this issue, because he believes, just like you stated, that what we are turning\nover about ourselves actually exceeds anything\nthat ARGUS-IS could do from above because we're\ndoing it willfully. And so what it's doing is\nit's creating an ability, if someone wants to know about you, if someone, let's say in government, wants to know about Lex Fridman, they can find out everything about you. And then that gets used for tagging, tracking, and ultimately. In the war theater, it was\ncalled find, fix, finish, well, what do you think the\nfinish is in that statement? - It's not pleasant. - It's called a drone strike. Find, find them with the biometric, fix him, meaning fix his position, we know he's moving in a\ncar, that's him, that's him. Finish him, call it\nin, drone strike, boom."

If we go back to World War II, we look at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the dropping of the two bombs. I would love to get your opinion on whether we should or\nshouldn't have done that, and also to get your opinion on what would've happened if Hitler and Germany built the bomb first. Do you think it was possible he could have built the bomb first? - In my researching Third Reich weapons for \"Operation Paperclip\",\nbecause of course, we got a lot of those scientists after. - Which is another great book and a terrifyingly complicated operation. - Yes, at what point do the ends justify the means? But in looking at those programs, and we acquired Hitler's\nfavorite weapons designers, and I'm talking about\nweapons of mass destruction, like chemical weapons\nand biological weapons. But of course, America was\nahead in the nuclear program, and an interesting detail\nreading Albert Speer's memoirs, was Speer referring to\na conversation he had with Hitler where Hitler said, \"No, I don't wanna do that,\nthat's Jewish science.\" And so because of\nHitler's own racial ethnic prejudices, they didn't develop the bomb. As far as should we have\ndropped the bombs on Hiroshima, I've interviewed all kinds of people with different opinions, most of them that had ended the war. The best interview and\nmost meaningful perhaps that I ever did was with Al O'Donnell, who was a participant in\nthe Battle of Okinawa, which was like this insane, just to read stories about Okinawa, it makes your hair stand on end. And O'Donnell, like so many others, was slated to invade mainland Japan to his\nalmost certain death. So somebody like that, it makes sense right from the get go why he would be pro nuclear weapons. It saved his own personal life and it saved everyone that he knew that he was fighting with,\nand it ended the war. - Do you think it sent a signal, like without that we wouldn't have known perhaps about the power of the weapons? In the long arc of that\nhistory, 70 years plus, it is the reason why\ndeterrence has worked so far. - Yes, that's an interesting thought. My thought goes to this idea of more, that everybody always wants more. It's a very dangerous,\nit's like more power, literally, not just figure, more power. And what is more confounding to me beyond the fact that we\ndropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki\nand the war ended, is that this decision was then made to develop the thermonuclear bomb. The degree of magnitude of\nthat power is mind-boggling, I mean, even projects\nwithin the Manhattan Project defined thermonuclear weapon, the thermonuclear weapon\nas the evil thing, like it was evil, it's\na weapon of genocide. Atomic weapons destroy cities, thermonuclear weapons\ndestroy civilizations."

Do you think that there\nis some deep human way in which we're attending to this kind of global war eternally? - Well, the optimistic answer of that would be that we could evolve beyond that. Because certainly, if we\nlook at our ancestors, they had not developed their consciousness as far as we have, to be able to build the tools that we have. And so the hopeful answer is, we will evolve beyond\nthis kind of brute force, kill the other guy attitude. Certainly, these are questions that will become more obvious over time.

  "full_text": "- The United States has 1,770 nuclear weapons deployed, meaning those weapons could launch in as little as 60 seconds\nand up to a couple minutes. Some of them on the bombers\nmight take an hour or so. Russia has 1,674 deployed nuclear weapons, same scenario, their weapon systems are on par with ours. That's not to mention the\n12,500 nuclear weapons amongst the nine nuclear armed nations. The sucking up into the nuclear stem, 300 mile an hour winds,\nyou're talking about people miles out getting sucked\nup into that stem. When you see the mushroom cloud, Lex, that would be people, 30, 40 mile wide mushroom cloud blocking out the sun. And that speaks nothing of the radiation poisoning that follows. In addition to the launch\non warning concept, there's this other insane concept called sole presidential authority. And you might think, in a\ndemocracy that's impossible, you can't just start a war. Well, you can just start a nuclear war if you are the commander in chief, the President of the United States. In fact, you're the only\none who can do that. We are one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away\nfrom nuclear Armageddon. No matter how nuclear war starts, it ends with everyone dead. - The following is a\nconversation with Annie Jacobsen, an investigative journalist,\nPulitzer Prize finalist, and author of several\namazing books on war, weapons, government secrecy,\nand national security, including the books titled \"Area 51\", \"Operation Paperclip\", \"The\nPentagon's Brain Phenomena\", \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\", and her new book, \"Nuclear War\". This is a Lex Fridman\npodcast, to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Annie Jacobsen. Let's start with an immensely dark topic, nuclear war, how many\npeople would a nuclear war between the United States and Russia kill? - So I'm coming back\nat you with a very dark answer and a very big number. And that number is 5 billion people. - You go second by\nsecond, minute by minute, hour by hour what would happen if the nuclear war started. So there's a lot of angles\nfrom which I would love to talk to you about this. First, how would the deaths happen in the short term and the long term? - So to start off, the\nreason I wrote the book is so that readers like you could see in appalling detail just how horrific nuclear war would be. And as you said, second\nby second, minute minute. The book covers nuclear\nlaunch to nuclear winter. I purposely don't get into the\npolitics that lead up to that or the national security maneuvers or the posturing or any of that, I just want people to know nuclear war is insane. And every source I\ninterviewed for this book, from Secretary of Defense, all retired, nuclear sub force commander,\nStratcom commander, FEMA director, on and on and on, nuclear weapons engineers,\nthey all shared with me the common denominator\nthat nuclear war is insane. First millions, then tens of millions, then hundreds of millions\nof people will die in the first 72 minutes of a nuclear war. And then comes nuclear winter where the billions happen from starvation. And so the shock power\nof all of this is meant for each and every one\nof us to say, wait, what? This actually exists behind\nthe veil of national security, most people do not think about\nnuclear war on a daily basis, and yet hundreds of thousands of people in the nuclear command and control are at the ready in the event it happens. - But it doesn't take too\nmany people to start one. - In the words of Richard Garwin, who was the nuclear weapons engineer who drew the plans for the\nIvy Mike thermonuclear bomb, the first thermonuclear bomb ever exploded in 1952. Garwin shared with me his opinion that all it takes is one nihilistic madman with a nuclear arsenal\nto start a nuclear war. And that's how I begin the scenario. - What are the different\nways it could start? Like literally, who presses a button, and what does it take to press a button? - So the way it starts is in space, meaning the US Defense Department has a early warning system. And the system in space is called SBIRS, a constellation of satellites\nthat is keeping an eye on all of America's enemies, so that the moment an ICBM launches, the satellite in space,\nand I'm talking about one 10th of the way to the moon, that's how powerful these\nsatellites are in geosync, they see the hot rocket exhaust on the ICBM in a fraction of a second after it launches, a fraction of a second. And so there begins this horrifying policy called launch on warning, and\nthat's the US counter attack. Meaning the reason that the United States is so ferociously watching\nfor a nuclear launch somewhere around the globe is\nso that the nuclear command and control system in the\nUS can move into action to immediately make a counterstrike. Because we have that\npolicy, launch on warning, which is exactly like it says, it means the United States will not wait to absorb a nuclear attack. It will launch nuclear weapons in response before the bomb actually hits. - So the president, as part of the launch on warning policy, has six minutes. I guess it can't launch for six minutes, but at six minute mark\nfrom that first warning, the president can launch. - And that was one of the\nmost remarkable details to really nail down for this book when I was reporting this book and talking to Secretary\nof Defenses, for example, who are the people who\nadvise the president on this matter, you say to yourself, wait a minute, how could that possibly be? And so let's unpack that,\nso in addition to the launch on warning concept, there's\nthis other insane concept called sole presidential authority. And you might think, in a\ndemocracy that's impossible, you can't just start a war. Well, you can just start a nuclear war if you are the commander in chief, the President of the United States, in fact, you're the only\none who can do that. And we can get into later why that exists, I was able to get the origin story of that concept from Los Alamos, they declassified it for the book. But the idea behind that is that nuclear war will unfold so fast, only one person can be\nin charge, the president, he asked permission of no one, not the Secretary of\nDefense, not the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of\nStaff, not the US Congress. So built into that is\nthis extraordinary speed, you talk about the six minute window, and some people say,\noh, that's ridiculous, how do we know that six minute window? Well, here's the best\nsort of hitting the nail on the head statement I can give you, which is, in President Reagan's memoirs, he refers to the six\nminute window and he says, he calls it irrational, which it is, he says, \"How can anyone\nmake a decision to launch nuclear weapons based on\na blip on a radar scope?\" His words, to unleash Armageddon. And yet, that is the\nreality behind nuclear war. - Just imagine sitting there, one person, because a president is a\nhuman being, sitting there, just got the warning that Russia launched. You have six minutes. I meditate on my mortality every day, and here you would be\nsitting and meditating, contemplating not just your own mortality, but the mortality of all the\npeople you know, loved ones. Just imagining, like what\nwould be going through my head is all the people I know and love, like personally, and knowing\nthat they'll be no more, most likely, and if they somehow survive, they will be suffering\nand will eventually die. I guess the question\nthat kept coming up is, how do we stop this? Is it inevitable that\nit's going to be escalated to a full on nuclear war\nthat destroys everything? And it seems like it\nwill be, it's inevitable. In the position of the president, it's almost inevitable\nthat they have to respond. - I mean, one of the\nthings I found shocking was how little, apparently\nmost presidents know about the responsibility that\nliterally lays at their feet. So you may think through\nthis six minute window, I may think through\nthis six minute window, but what I learned, like for example, former Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, was really helpful in\nexplaining this to me, because before he was SecDef, he served as the director of the CIA. And before that he was the\nWhite House Chief of Staff. And so he has seen these different roles that have been so close to the president, but he explained to me that when he was the White House Chief of\nStaff for President Clinton, he noticed how President\nClinton didn't want to ever really deal\nwith the nuclear issue, because he had so many\nother issues to deal with. And that only when Panetta became Secretary of Defense, he told me, did he really realize the\nweight of all of this. Because he knew he would be the person that the president would turn to, were he to be notified\nof a nuclear attack. And by the way, it's\nthe launch on warning, it's the ballistic missile seen from outer space by the satellite, and then there also must\nbe a second confirmation from a ground radar system. But in that process, which\nis just a couple minutes, everyone is getting ready\nto notify the president, and one of the first\npeople that gets notified by NORAD, or by Stratcom, or by NRO, these different parties that all see the early warning data, one of the first peoples that's notified is the Secretary of Defense\nas well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, because those two together are\ngoing to brief the president about, sir, you have\nsix minutes to decide. And that's where you realize\nthe immediacy of all of this is so counter to imagining the scenario. And again, all the\npresidents come into office, I have learned, understanding\nthe idea of deterrence, this idea that we have\nthese massive arsenals of nuclear weapons pointed at one another, ready to launch, so that\nwe never have nuclear war. But what we're talking\nabout now is what if we did? What if we did? And what you've raised is like, this really spooky, eerie subtext of the world right now, because many of the nuclear armed nations are in direct conflict with other nations. And for the first time in decades, nuclear threats are actually coming out of the mouths of leaders,\nthis is shocking. - So deterrence, the polite, implied assumption is\nthat nobody will launch, and if they did, we would launch back and everybody would be dead. But that assumption\nfalls apart completely, the whole philosophy of it falls apart once the first launch happens. - Absolutely.\n- Then you have six minutes to decide, wait a minute,\nare we going to hit back and kill everybody on earth? Or do we turn the other cheek in the most horrific way possible? - Well, when nuclear war starts, there's no like battle for\nNew York or battle for Moscow, it's just literally, it\nwas called in the Cold War push button warfare, but in\nessence, that is what it is. Let's get some numbers on\nthe table if you don't mind, because when you're saying\nlike, wait a minute, we're just hoping that it holds, let's just talk about Russia and the US, the arsenals that are literally pointed at one another right now. So the United States has 1,770 nuclear weapons deployed, meaning those weapons could launch in as little as 60 seconds\nand up to a couple minutes. Some of them on the bombers\nmight take an hour or so. Russia has 1,674 deployed nuclear weapons, same scenario, their weapon\nsystems are on par with ours. That's not to mention the\n12,500 nuclear weapons amongst the nine nuclear armed nations. But when you think about\nthose kind of arsenals of just between the\nUnited States and Russia, and you realize everything\ncan be launched in seconds and minutes, then you\nrealize the madness of mad, that this idea that no one would launch because it would assure\neveryone's destruction, yes, but what if someone did? And in my interviews\nwith scores of top tier national security advisors,\npeople who advise the president, people who are responsible\nfor these decisions, if they had to be made, every single one of them\nsaid it could happen. They didn't say this would never happen. And so the idea is worth thinking about, because I believe that it pulls back the veil on a fundamental security that if someone were to use\na tactical nuclear weapon, oh well, it's just an escalation. It's far more than that. - So to you, the use of a\ntactical nuclear weapon, maybe you can draw the\nline between a tactical and a strategic nuclear weapon,\nthat could be a catalyst, like that's a very difficult\nthing to walk back from. - Oh my God, almost certainly, and again, every person in the national\nsecurity environment will agree with that,\ncertainly on the American side. Strategic weapons, those are\nlike big weapons systems, America has a nuclear\ntriad, we have our ICBMs, which are the silo-based missiles that have a nuclear\nwarhead in the nose cone, and they can get from one continent to the other in roughly 30 minutes. Then we have our bombers, B-52s and B-2s that are nuclear capable. Those take travel time to\nget to another continent, those can also be recalled,\nthe ICBMs cannot be recalled or redirected once launched. - That one is a\nparticularly terrifying one. So land launched missiles, rockets with a warhead, can't be recalled. - Cannot be recalled or redirected. And speaking of how little\nthe presidents generally know, as we were talking a moment ago, President Reagan in 1983\ngave a press conference where he misstated that submarine launched ballistic missiles could be recalled. They cannot be recalled. Here's the guy in charge of the arsenal if it has to get let loose, and he doesn't even know\nthat they cannot be recalled. So this is the kind of\nmisinformation and disinformation. UN Secretary General, Antonio\nGuterres, recently said, when he was talking about\nthe conflicts rising around the world, he said,\n\"We are one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away\nfrom nuclear Armageddon.\" - So just to sort of linger\non the previous point of tactical nukes, so you were\ndescribing strategic nukes, land launched bombers, submarine launched, what are tactical nukes? - So that's the triad,\nand we have the triad and Russia has the triad. Tactical nuclear weapons\nare smaller warheads that were designed to be used in battle. And that is what Russia\nis sort of threatening to use right now, that is\nthis idea that you would make a decision on the battlefield in an operational environment to use a tactical nuclear weapon. You're just sort of upping the ante. But the problem is that all treaties are based on this idea of no nuclear use. You cannot cross that line. And so the what would happen\nif the line is crossed is so devastating to even consider, I think that the conversation\nis well worth having among everyone that is\nin a power of position. As the UN Secretary General\nsaid, \"This is madness.\" This is madness, we must\ncome back from the brink, we are at the brink. - Can we talk about some other numbers? So you mentioned the number of warheads, so land launched, how long\ndoes it take to travel across the ocean from the\nUnited States to Russia, from Russia to the United States, from China to the United\nStates, approximately how long? - When I was writing an\nearlier book on DARPA, the Pentagon Science Agency, I went to a library down in San Diego called the Giza Library, to\nlook at Herb York's papers, Herb Bjork was the first chief scientist for the Pentagon for\nDARPA, then called ARPA. And I had been trying to get the number from the various agencies\nthat be, to answer you, like, what is the exact\nnumber and how do we know it? And like, does it change? And as technology advances,\ndoes that number reduce? All these kinds of questions, and no one will answer that\nquestion on an official level. And so much to my surprise, I found the answer in Herb\nYork's dusty archive of papers. And this is information\nthat was jealously guarded, I mean, it's not necessarily classified, but it certainly wasn't out there. And I felt like, wow, Herb\nYork left these behind for someone like me to find. And he wanted to know the\nanswer to your question, and as the guy in charge of it all, so he hired this group\nof scientists who then, and still are in many ways, like the Superman\nscientists of the Pentagon, and they're called the JASON Scientists, many conspiracies about them abound, I interviewed their founder and have interviewed many of them, but they whittled the\nnumber down to seconds. Specifically for Herb York,\nand it goes like this, 'cause this is where my jaw\ndropped and I went, wow, okay. So 26 minutes and 40 seconds from a launchpad in the Soviet\nUnion to the East coast. And it happens in three phases, very simple and interesting to remember, 'cause then suddenly all\nof this makes more sense, boost phase, mid-course phase,\nand then terminal phase. Boost phase, five minutes, that's when the rocket launches. So you just imagine a rocket\ngoing off the launchpad and the fire beneath it, again, that's why the satellites can see it, now it's becoming visual,\nnow it makes sense to me. Five minutes, and that's where\nthe rocket can be tracked. And then imagine learning, wait a minute, after five minutes, the\nrocket can no longer be seen from space. The satellite can only see\nthe hot rocket exhaust. Then the missile enters its\nmid-course phase, 20 minutes. And that's the ballistic part of it, where it's kind of\nflying up at between 500 and 700 miles above the earth, and moving very fast and with the earth, until it gets very close to its target, and the last 100 seconds\nare terminal phase. It's where the warhead reenters the atmosphere and detonates, 26 minutes and 40 seconds. Now, in my scenario, I open with North Korea launching a\none megaton nuclear warhead at Washington DC, that's the\nnihilistic madman maneuver, that's the bolt out of the blue attack that everyone in Washington\nwill tell you they're afraid of. And North Korea has a little\nbit different geography, and so I had MIT professor\nemeritus Ted Postol do the math, 33 minutes from a launchpad in Pyongyang to the East\nCoast of the United States. You get the idea, it's about 30 minutes, but hopefully now that allows readers to suddenly see all this as a real, you almost see it as poetry, as terrible as that may sound, you can visualize it and\nsuddenly it makes sense. And I think the sensemaking part of it is really what I'm after in this book, because I want people to\nunderstand, on the one hand, it's incredibly simple,\nit's just the people that have made it so complicated. - But it's one of those\nthings that can change all of world history\nin a matter of minutes. We just don't, as a human civilization, have experience with that. But it doesn't mean it'll never happen. It can happen just like that. - I mean, I think what you're after, and I couldn't agree more with is like, why is this fundamentally annihilating system, a\nsystem of mass genocide, as John Rubel, in the book refers to it, why does it still exist? We've had 75 years since there have been two superpowers with the nuclear bomb. So that threat has been there for 75 years and we have managed to stay alive. One of the reasons why\nso many of the sources in the book agreed to talk to me, people who had not\npreviously gone on the record about all of this, was because\nthey are now approaching the end of their lives. They spent their lives dedicated to preventing nuclear World War iii. And they'll be the\nfirst people to tell you we're closer to this as a\nreality than ever before. And so the only bright side of any of this is that the answer lies most\ndefinitely in communication. - So there's a million\nother questions here. I think the details are fascinating and important to understand. So one, you also say nuclear submarines, you mentioned about 30\nminutes, 26, 33 minutes, but with nuclear submarines, that number can be much, much lower. So how long does it take\nfor a warhead missile to reach the East Coast\nof the United States from a submarine? - Just when you thought it was really bad, and then you kind of realize\nabout the submarines, I mean, the submarines are what are called second strike capacity, and\nsubmarines were described to me this way, they are as\ndangerous to civilization, and let me say, a nuclear armed,\nnuclear powered submarine, is as dangerous to\ncivilization as an asteroid. They are unstoppable,\nthey are unlocatable. The former chief of the\nnuclear submarine forces, Admiral Michael Conner, told me, \"It's easier to find a\ngrapefruit sized object in space than a submarine under the sea.\" So these things are like hell machines, and they're moving around\nthroughout the oceans, ours, Russia's, China's, maybe\nNorth Korea's, constantly, and we now know they're\nsneaking up to the east and west coast of the United States within a couple hundred miles. How do we know that, why do we know that? Well, I found a document\ninside of a budget that the defense department\nwas going to congress for more money recently and showed maps of precisely where these submarines, how close they were getting\nto the eastern seaboard. - So wait, wait, wait, so nuclear subs are getting within 200 miles? - Couple hundred miles, yes, they weren't precise on the number, but when you look at the map-\n- Couple hundred. - Yep, and that's when\nyou're talking about under 10 minutes from launch to strike. - Undetectable. - And they're undetectable,\nthe map making is done after the fact because\nof a lot of underwater surveillance systems that we have, but in real time, you cannot\nfind a nuclear submarine. And just the way a submarine launches, goes 150 feet below the surface to launch its ballistic missile. I mean, it comes out of the missile tube, and with enough thrust, the thrusters, they ignite outside the water and then they move into boost. And so the technology involved is just stunning and shocking, and again, trillions of dollars\nspent so that we never have a nuclear war, but\nmy God, what if we did. - As you write, they're called the handmaidens of the apocalypse. What a terrifying label. I mean, one of the things\nyou also write about, so for the land launched ones, they're presumably underground. So the silos, how long does it take to go from like pressing the button to them emerging from\nunderground for launch? And is that part detectable\nor it's only the heat. - So what's interesting about the silos, America has 400 silos, we've had more. But we have 400 and they're underground, and they're called Minuteman, after the Revolutionary War heroes. But the sort of joke in Washington is they're not called\nMinuteman for nothing, because they can launch in one minute. So the president orders\nthe launch of the ICBMs, ICBM stands for Intercontinental\nBallistic Missile, he orders the launch and\nthey launch 60 seconds later, and then they take 30 some odd minutes to get to where they're going. The submarines take about 14 or 15 minutes from the launch command\nto actually launching. And that has to do, I surmise, with the location of the\nsubmarine, its depth. Some of these things are\nso highly classified, and other details are shockingly available if you look deep enough or\nif you ask enough questions, and you can go from one\ndocument to the next to the next and really find these answers. - Not to ask top secret questions, but to what degree do you think the Russians know the\nlocations of the silos in the US and vice versa? - Lex, you and I can find\nthe location of every silo right now.\n- Oh no. - They're all there, and before\nthey were there on Google, they were there in maps,\nbecause we're a democracy and we make these things known. Now, what's tricky is that\nRussia and North Korea rely upon what are called\nRoad Mobile Launchers. So Russia has a lot of underground silos, all of the scenario takes you through these different facilities\nthat really do exist, and they're all sourced with\nhow many weapons they have and their launch procedures and whatnot. But in addition to\nhaving underground silos, they have road mobile launchers. And that means you just have\none of these giant ICBMs on a 22 axle truck that can move stealthily around the country\nso that it can't be targeted by the US Defense Department. We don't have those in\nAmerica, because presumably, the average American\nisn't gonna go for like, the ICBM road mobile launcher driving down the street\nin your town or city, which is why the defense\ndepartment will justify we need the second strike\ncapacity capability, the submarines, because I mean, the wonky stuff that is worth looking into if you really dig the book\nand are like, wait a minute, it's all footnoted\nwhere you can learn more about how these systems\nhave changed over time, and why more than anything,\nit's very difficult to get out of this catch 22 conundrum that we need nuclear\nweapons to keep us safe, that is the real enigma, because the other guys have them. And the other guys have\nsort of more sinister ways of using them, or at least\nthat's what the nomenclature out of the Pentagon will always\nbe when anyone tries to say, we just need to really think\nabout full disarmament. - You've written about\nintelligence agencies. How good are the intelligence\nagencies on this? How much does CIA know about the Russian launch\nsites, and capabilities, and command and control procedures and all of this, and vice versa? - I mean, all of this,\nbecause it's decades old, is really well known. If you go to the Federation\nof American Scientists, they have a team led by a\nguy called Hans Kristensen who runs what's called\nthe nuclear notebook, and he and his team every\nyear are keeping track of this number of warheads on these number of weapons systems, and because of the treaties,\nthe different signatories to the treaty all report these numbers, and of course, the different\nintelligence community people are keeping track of what's being revealed honestly and\nreported with transparency and what is being hidden. The real issue is the new systems that Russia is working on right now, and that will lead us, we are kind of moving into an era whereby the threat of actually\nhaving new weapon systems that are nuclear capable is very real, because of the escalating\ntensions around the world. And that's where the CIA, I would guess, is doing most of its work right now. - So most of your research\nis kind of looking at the older versions of the system, and presumably there's potentially secret development of new ones? Hopefully not.\n- Which violates treaties. - Yes.\n- So yes, that is where the intelligence agencies. But at a point it's overkill, literally and figuratively. People are up in arms about\nthese hypersonic weapons, well, we have a hypersonic\nweapons program, FALCON, Google Black Swift,\nthis is Lockheed's doing. DARPA exists to create\nthe vast weapon systems of the future, that is its job, it has been doing that\nsince its creation in 1957. I would never believe that\nwe aren't ahead of everyone, call me over informed or\nnaive, one or the other. That would be my position, because DARPA works from the\nchicken or the egg scenario, that once you learn about something, once you learn Russia's\ncreated this typhoon submarine, which may or may not be viable, it's too late if you\ndon't already have one. - We'll probably talk\nabout DARPA a little bit. One of the things that\nmakes me sad about Lockheed, many things makes me sad about Lockheed, but one of the things is\nbecause it's very top secret, you can't show off all\nthe incredible engineering going on there, the other thing\nthat's more philosophical, DARPA also, is that war seems to stimulate most of our, not most, but a large percent of our exciting innovation in engineering. But that's also the pragmatic\nfact of life on earth, is that the risk of annihilation is a great motivator for innovation, for engineering and so on. But yes, I would not\ndiscount the United States in its ability to build\nthe weapons of the future, nuclear included, again, terrifying. Can you tell me about the\nnuclear football as it's called? - I think Americans are\nfamiliar with the football, at least anyone who sort of follows national security concepts,\nbecause it's a satchel, it's a leather satchel that\nis always with a military aid, in secret service nomenclature,\nthat's the mill aid. And he's trailing around\nthe president 24/7, 365 days a year, and also the\nvice president, by the way, with the ability to launch nuclear war in that six minute window all the time. That is also called the football, and it's always with the president. To report this part of the book, I interviewed a lot of\npeople in the Secret Service that are with the president\nand talk about this. And the director of the Secret Service, a guy called Lew Merletti, told me a story that I just really found fascinating. He was also in charge of\nthe president's detail, president Clinton, this was, before he was director\nof the Secret Service. And he told me the story about how, he said, \"The football\nis with the president at all times, period.\" They were traveling to Syria, and Clinton was meeting\nwith President Assad, and they got into an elevator, Clinton and the Secret Service team, and one of Assad's guys was like, no, like about the mill aid. And Lew said it was like a standoff, because there was no way,\nthey were not going to have the president with his\nfootball in an elevator. And it kind of sums up, for me anyways, you realize what goes\ninto every single one of these decisions. You realize the massive system of systems behind every item you might just see in passing and glancing on the news as you see the mill aid\ncarrying that satchel, well, what's in that satchel? I really dug into that\nto report this book. - What is in that satchel? (both giggling) - Well, okay, first of all, people always say it's\nincredibly classified, I mean, people talk about\nUFOs, it's incredibly, I mean, come on guys,\nthat is nothing burger, you wanna know what's really classified, what's in that football,\nwhat's in that satchel? But the PEAD, presidential\nemergency action directives, those have never been leaked,\nno one knows what they are. What we do know from one of the mill aids who spoke on the record, a\nguy called Buzz Patterson, he describes the president's orders, so if a nuclear war has begun, if the president has been told\nthere are nuclear missiles, one or more coming at the United States, you have to launch in a counter attack. The red clock is ticking, you have to get the blue\nimpact clock ticking. He needs to look at this list to decide what targets to strike and\nwhat weapon systems to use. And that is what is on,\naccording to Buzz Patterson, a piece of sort of laminated plastic, he described it like a Denny's menu. And from that menu, the president chooses targets and chooses weapon systems. - And it's probably super old school, like all top secret systems are, because they have to be\ntested over, and over, and over, and over, and over. - Yes, and it's non-digital. - Non-digital, it might literally be a Denny's menu from hell. - Right, and meanwhile I learned this only in reporting the book,\nthere is a identical black book inside the Stratcom bunker in Nebraska. Three command bunkers are\ninvolved when nuclear war begins, there's the bunker beneath the Pentagon, which is called the National\nMilitary Command Center. Then there is the bunker\nbeneath Cheyenne Mountain, which everyone, or many\npeople have heard of because it's been made famous in movies, that is a very real bunker. And then there is a third bunker, which people are not so familiar with, which is the bunker beneath\nstrategic command in Nebraska. And so it's described to me this way, the Pentagon bunker is the beating heart, the Cheyenne Mountain\nbunker is the brains, and the Stratcom bunker is the muscle. The Stratcom commander will receive word from the president, launch orders, and then directs the 150,000 people beneath him what to do, from the bunker beneath Stratcom. He gets the orders, then he\nhas to run out of the building and jump onto what's\ncalled the doomsday plane, we'll get into that in a minute, let me just finish the, I mean, but again- - This is good.\n- These are the details, this is like, these are the systematic sequential details that happen in seconds and minutes, and reporting them, I never ceased to be amazed by what a system it is. A follows B, it's just numerical. - Yeah, but as we discuss this procedure, each individual person\nthat follows that procedure might lose the big picture\nof the whole thing. I mean, especially when you\nrealize what is happening, that almost out of fear,\nyou just follow the steps. - Yep, or, okay, so imagine this, imagine being the president\nand you got that six minute, you're looking at your\nlist of strike options, you're being briefed by your chairman of the Joint Chiefs of\nStaff and your SecDef, and this other really spooky detail, in the Stratcom bunker, in addition to the nuclear strike\nadvisor who can answer very specific questions\nif the president's like, wait a minute, why are we\nstriking that, not that? There's also a weather officer, and this is the kind of human detail that kept me up at night,\nbecause that weather officer is in charge of explaining\nto the president really fast, how many people are going\nto die and how many people are going to die in minutes, weeks, months, and years\nfrom radiation fallout. - Because a lot of that has to do with the weather system.\n- Yes. Yes, and so the humanness balanced out with the\nmechanization of it all, it's just really grotesque. - So the doomsday plane\nfrom Stratcom, what's that? Where's it going, what's on it? - Okay, ready? It's gonna fly in circles. That's where it's going,\nit's flying in circles around the United States of America, so that nuclear weapons can be launched from the air after the ground systems are taken out by the incoming ICBMs, or the incoming submarine\nlaunched ballistic missiles. This has been in play since the fifties. These are the contingency plans for when nuclear war happens. So again, going back\nto this absurd paradox, nuclear war will never happen. Mutual assured destruction, that is why deterrence will hold. Well, I found a talk\nthat the deputy director of Stratcom gave to a\nvery close knit group, where he said, \"Yes, deterrence will hold, but if it fails, everything unravels.\" And think about that word unravels, and the unraveling is the\ndoomsday plane launches, the Stratcom commander jumps\nin, he's in that plane, he's flying around the United States, and he's making decisions, because the Pentagon's been taken out. At 9/11, by the way, Bush\nwas in the doomsday plane. - And Bush had to make decisions quickly, but not so quickly, not as quickly as he would've needed to have done if there's a nuclear launch. - I mean.\n- Six minutes. - It basically happens in three acts. There's the first 24\nminutes, the next 24 minutes, and the last 24 minutes. And that is the reality\nof nuclear weapons. - What is the interceptor\ncapabilities of the United States? How many nuclear missiles can be stopped? - I was at a dinner party\nwith a very informed person, like somebody who really\nshould have known this. This is what I was considering writing and reporting this\nbook, and he said to me, \"Oh Annie, that would never happen, because of our powerful\ninterceptor system.\" Okay, well, he's wrong,\nlet me tell you about our powerful interceptor system. First of all, we have\n44 interceptor missiles total, period, full\nstop, let me repeat, 44. Earlier we were talking\nabout Russia's 1,670 deployed nuclear weapons, how are those 44 interceptor\nmissiles gonna work? And they also have a\nsuccess rate of around 50%, so they work 50% of the time. There are 40 of them in Alaska, and there are four of them at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara. And they are responsible\nat about nine minutes into the scenario, after\nthe ICBM has finished that five minute boost\nphase we talked about, now it's in mid-course phase, and the ground radar\nsystems have identified, yes, this is an incoming ICBM, and now the interceptor\nmissiles have to launch. It's essentially shooting\na missile with a missile, inside the interceptor, which\nis just a big giant rocket, in its nose cone, it has what's called, the aptly named\nExoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. There's no explosives in that thing, it's literally just going to take out the warhead, ideally, with force. So one of them is going like mock 20, and I mean, the speeds at\nwhich these two moving objects hurdling through space\nare going is astonishing, and the fact that\ninterception is even possible is really remarkable,\nbut it's only possible 50% of the time. - Is it possible that\nwe only know about 44, but there could be a lot more? - No, impossible. That I would be willing to bet. - And how well tested\nare these interceptors? - Well, that's where\nwe get the success rate that's around 50% because of the tests. And actually, the interceptor program is, are you ready for this? It's on strategic pause right now, meaning the interceptor\nmissiles are there, but developing them and making them more effective is on strategic pause, because they can't be made more effective. People have these fantasies that we have a system like the Iron Dome, and they see this in current events, and they're like, oh, our\ninterceptors would do that, it's just simply not true. - Why can't an Iron Dome-like system be constructed for nuclear warheads? - We have systems I write\nabout called the THAAD system, which is ground based,\nand then the Edge system, which is on vessels, and these are great at shooting down some rockets, but they can only shoot\nthem sort of one at a time, you cannot shoot the mother\nload as it's coming in. Those are the smaller systems, the tactical nuclear weapons. And by the way, our THAAD systems\nare all deployed overseas, and our Edge systems are all out at sea. And again, reporting that,\nI was like, wait, what? You have to really hunker\ndown, are we sure about this? People really don't wanna\nbelieve this is an actual fact. After 9/11, Congress considered putting Edge's missiles and\nmaybe even THAAD systems along the west coast of the United States to specifically deal with the threats against nuclear armed North Korea. But it hasn't done so yet, and again, you have to ask yourself, wait\na minute, this is insanity, one nuclear weapon gets\nby any of these systems and it's full out nuclear warfare. So that's not the solution, more nuclear weapons is not the solution. - I'm looking for a hopeful\nthing here about North Korea. How many deployed nuclear\nwarheads does North Korea have? So does the current\nsystem, as we described it, the interceptors and so on, have a hope against the\nNorth Korean attack? The one that you mentioned\npeople are worried about. - So North Korea has 50, let's say 50 nuclear weapons right now. Some NGOs put it at more than 100, it's impossible to know\nbecause North Korea's nuclear weapons program\nhas no transparency. They're the only nuclear armed nation that doesn't announce when they do a ballistic missile\ntest, everyone else does, no one wants to start a\nnuclear war by accident. So if Russia's gonna launch\nan ICBM, they tell us, if we're gonna launch one, and\nI'm talking test runs here, with the dummy warhead, we\ntell them, not North Korea. That's a fact. So we're constantly up against\nthe fear of North Korea. In the scenario, I have the incoming North Korean one megaton weapon coming in, and the interceptor system\ntries to shoot it down. So there's not enough time, and this, by the way, I ran by all generals from the Pentagon\nwho run these scenarios for NORAD, and confirmed\nall of this as fact, this is the situation. So in the scenario I have\nthe nuclear ICBM coming in, the interceptor missiles try\nto shoot down the warhead, the capability is not like\nwhat's called shoot and look, there's not enough time to go, like, and we're gonna try to\nget it, we missed it, okay, let's go for another\none, so you have to go. (mimicking shooting) So in my scenario, we fire off four, which is about what I\nwas told, one to four, because you're worried about the next one that's gonna come in. You're gonna use up 10%\nof your missile force, of your interceptor force\non one and all four miss, and that's totally plausible, - Right, how likely are mistakes, accidents, false alarms taken as real, all this kind of stuff in this picture? So like, we've kind of assumed the detection works correctly. How likely is it possible? You've described this long\nchain of events that can happen, how possible is it just to make a mistake, a stupid human mistake along the way? - There have been at least\nsix known, like absolute, like, oh my God, close calls, thank God this happened, type scenarios. One was described to me with\nan actual personal participant, former secretary of defense, Bill Perry, and he described what\nhappened to him in 1979. He was not yet secretary of defense, he was the deputy director of\nthe research and engineering, which is like a big job at the Pentagon. The night watch fell on him, essentially, and he gets this call in\nthe middle of the night, he's told that Russia has launched, not just ICBMs, but submarine\nlaunched ballistic missiles are coming at the United States. And he's about to notify the president that the six minute window has to begin, when he learns it was a mistake. The mistake was that\nthere was a training tape with a nuclear war scenario. We haven't even begun to\ntalk about the nuclear war scenarios that the Pentagon runs, an actual VHS training tape\nhad been incorrectly inserted into a system at the Pentagon. And so this nuclear launch showed up at that bunker beneath the Pentagon and at the bunker beneath Stratcom, because they're connected, as being real. And then it was like, oh, whoops, it's actually a simulation test tape. And Perry described to\nme what that was like, the pause in his spirit, and his mind, and his heart when he realized I'm about to have to tell the president that he needs to launch nuclear weapons. And he learned just in the neck of time that it was an error. And that's one of five examples. - Can you speak to maybe,\nis there any more color to the feelings he was feeling? Like what was your sense? And given all the\nexperts you've talked to, what can be said about the seconds that one feels once finding\nout that a launch has happened, even if that information\nis false information? - For me personally, that's\nthe only firsthand story that I ever heard, because it's\nso rare and it's so unique. And most people in the\nnational security system, at least in the past, have been loathed to talk about any of this. It's like the sacred oath, it's taboo. It's taboo to go against\nthe system of systems that is making sure\nnuclear war never happens. Bill Perry was one of the\nfirst people who did this. And a lot of it, I believe, at least in my lengthy conversations with him, we had a lot of Zoom calls over Covid when I began reporting this, and he had a lot to do with me feeling like I could write\nthis book from a human point of view and not just\nfrom the mechanized systems. And I only lightly touch upon this, because it's such a\nfast, sweeping scenario, but Perry, for example,\nspent his whole life dedicated to building weapons of war, only later in life to\nrealize this is madness. And he shared with me that it was that idea about one's\ngrandchildren inheriting these nuclear arsenals, and the lack of wisdom that comes with their origin stories. When you're involved in\nthe ground up, apparently, perhaps your different kind of steward of these systems than if\nyou just inherit them, and they are pages in a manual. - People forget, you mentioned the kind of nuclear war\nscenarios that the Pentagon runs. What do you know about those? - I mean, again, they are very classified. I mean, it was interesting coming across levels of classification I\ndidn't even know existed, like ECI, for example, is exceptionally controlled information. But the Pentagon nuclear\nwar gaming scenarios, they're almost all still classified. One of them was declassified recently, if you can call it that. I show an image of it in the book and it's just basically like, almost entirely redacted, and then like, there'll be a date, or it'll say like, phase one, and that one\nwas called Proud Prophet. But what was incredible about\nthe declassification process of that is it allowed a couple of people who were there to talk about it, and that's why we have that information. And I write about Proud\nProphet in the book, because it was super\nsignificant in many ways. One, it was happening right, in 1983, it was an insane moment in nuclear arsenals, there were 60,000 nuclear weapons, right now there's 12,500, so we've come a long way baby in terms of disarmament,\nbut there were 60,000. And by the way, that was\nnot the ultimate high, the ultimate high was 70,000. This is insane, and Ronald\nReagan was president and he orders this war\ngame called Proud Prophet. And everyone that mattered was involved, they were running the war game scenarios, and what we learned from\nhis declassification is that no matter how nuclear war starts, there was a bunch of different scenarios, with NATO involved, without NATO, all different scenarios, no\nmatter how nuclear war starts, it ends in Armageddon, it\nends with everyone dead. I mean, this is shocking\nwhen you think about that coupled with the idea\nthat all that has been done in the 40 some odd years since is, okay, let's just really lean in even harder to this theoretical\nphenomena of deterrence, 'cause that's all it is,\nit's just a statement, Lex, like deterrence will hold. Okay, well, what if it doesn't? Well, we know from Proud Prophet\nwhat happens if it doesn't. - Almost always, so there's no\nmechanisms in the human mind, in the human soul that stops it, in the governments that we've created. The procedure escalates always. - I mean, here's a crazy nomenclature jargon thing for you, ready? Escalate to deescalate,\nthat's what comes out of it. Think about what I just\nsaid, escalate to deescalate. So someone strikes you\nwith a nuclear weapon, you're gonna escalate it. General Hayden recently said,\nhe was Stratcom commander, he was sort of saber rattling\nwith North Korea during Covid and he said, \"They need to know, if they launch one nuclear\nweapon, we launch one, if they launch two, we launch two.\" But it's actually more than that, they launch one, we launch 80. That's called escalate\nto deescalate, like pound the you know what out of\nthem to get them to stop. - But I mean, there is,\nto make a case for that, there is a reason to the madness, because you want to threaten\nthis gigantic response. But when it comes to\nit, the seconds before, there is still a probability\nthat you'll pull back. - Which brings us to the\nmost terrifying facts that I learned in all of that, and that has to do with errors. Not errors of, like we\nspoke about a minute ago with a simulation test tape, I'm talking about if one madman, one nihilistic madman were\nto launch a nuclear weapon as I write in this scenario, and we needed to escalate to deescalate, we needed to send nuclear weapons at, let's say North Korea\nas I do in my scenario. Well, what is completely unknown to 98% of the planet is that not only do the Russians\nhave a very flawed satellite system, so that\nthey cannot interpret what is happening properly, but there is a absolutely\nexistential flaw in the system, which Secretary of Defense,\nLeon Panneta confirmed with me. Which is that our ICBMs\ndo not have enough range, if we launch a counter attack\nagainst, say North Korea, our ICBMs must fly over Russia. They must fly over Russia. So imagine saying, oh no, no, these 82 warheads that are gonna actually strike the Northern Korean peninsula are not coming for you Russia,\nour adversary right now that we're sort of saber\nrattling with, just trust us. And that is where nuclear\nwar unfolds into Armageddon. And that hole in national\nsecurity is shocking, and as Panetta told me, no\none wants to discuss it. - And if one nuclear weapon\ndoes reach its target, I presume communication\nbreaks down completely, or like there's a high risk\nof breakdown of communication. - Well, let's back up, we are\nboth presumptuous to assume that communication could\neven happen prior to, and let me give you a\nvery specific example, during the Ukraine war,\nif perhaps you remember, I think it was in November of 2022, news reports erroneously stated that a Russian rocket, a Russian\nmissile had hit Poland, a NATO country, it turned\nout to be a mistake, but for several hours, this\nwas actually the information that was all over the news, breaking news. 36 hours later, the chairman\nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley,\ngave a press conference and talked about this and admitted that he could not reach\nhis Russian counterpart during those 36 hours. He could not reach him. How are you going to not have an absolute Armageddon-like furor with nuclear weapons in the air if people can't get on the phone during a ground war? - I'd like to believe that there's people in major nations that don't give a damn about the bullshit of politics and can always just pick up the phone, sort of very close to the\ntop, but not at the very top, and just cut through the bullshit of it in situations like this. - I hope that's true, I doubt it is, and lemme tell you why, and neither you nor I are\npolitical from what I gather, so I just write about Potus,\nPresident of the United States. You have no idea what my politics are, because they shouldn't matter, no one should be for nuclear war, or no one should be for\nnational insecurity, yes, you wanna have a strong nation, but once you get into politics, then you're talking about sycophants. And the more a political\nleader becomes divisive, becomes polemic, the more his platform is predicated on hating the other side, either within his own country or with alleged enemy nations. The more you surround yourself, as we see in the current\nday, with sycophants, with people who will tell\nyou not only what they think you wanna hear, but will\nhelp them to hold onto power. So you don't have wise decision makers, long gone are the days\nwhere we had presidents who had advisors on\nboth sides of the aisle. That's really important,\nbecause you wanna have differing opinions, but as\nthings become more viperous, both here in the United States and in nuclear armed nations, all bets are off at whether your advisors are gonna give you good advice. - Who are the people around the president of the United States that give advice in this six minute window? Maybe you could speak\nto the detail of that, but also to the spirit of\nthe way they see the world, how many of them are warmongers? How many of them are kind\nof big picture peace, humanity type of thinkers? - Well, again, we're talking\nabout that six minute window, so it's not exactly like you can, let me put a pot of coffee\non and really tell me what you think and we can strategize here, you have your SecDef and your chairman, maybe the vice chairman, and, okay, we haven't even begun\nto talk about the fact that at the same time\nthese advisors also have a parallel concern and that's called continuity of government. So while they're trying to advise on the nuclear counterstrike in response to the incoming nuclear missile,\nthey have to be thinking how are we gonna keep the\ngovernment functioning when the missiles start hitting, when the bombs start going off? And that is about getting yourself out of the Pentagon, let's say, getting yourself to one\nof these nuclear bunkers that I write about at length in the book. So how much can you ask of a human? Because it comes down to a human, secretary of defense is a human. And imagine that job while\ntrying to advise the president. And then there's also a\nreally interesting term, which I learned about called\njamming the president, which is often understood in Washington that the military advisors would, we don't know if this is\nlegit, we've never seen it put to the test, but\njamming the president means the military advisors are gonna push for a really aggressive\ncounter attack immediately. And again, you're the\npresident who's not really been paying attention to this, because he has many other\nthings to deal with, speed is not conducive to wisdom. - Can you speak to the\njamming the president? So your sense is the advisors would by default be pushing for\naggressive counter attack. - That is a term in sort\nof the national security nuclear command and control\nhistorical documentation that many of the people\nthat you might call the more dovish type\npeople are worried about, that the more hawkish people are going to, the military advisors are\ngonna be jamming the president to make these decisions\nabout which targets, not if, but what.\n- Right, which targets. The argument will be about which targets, - Yes,\n- not about if. - Yes. - I hope that even the war mongers would at this moment,\nbecause what underlies the idea of you wanting to go to war? It's power, it's like\nwanting to destroy the enemy and be the big kid on the block. But with nuclear war, it just\nfeels like that falls apart. Do do you think war\nmongers actually believe they can win a nuclear war? - Well, you've raised a\nreally important question that we look to the historical\nrecord for that answer, because astonishingly, all of this began, like when Russia first got the bomb in 1949, the powers that be, and I write about them in the book in a setup for the moment of launch, it's called how we got here. And you see, and I cite\ndeclassified documents from some of these early meetings where nuclear war plans\nwere being laid out. And absolutely, back in\nthe 1950s, the generals and the admirals that were\nrunning the nuclear command and control system believed\nthat we could fight and win a nuclear war despite hundreds of millions of people dying. This was the prevailing thought. And only over time did the kind of concept\ncome into play that no, we can never have a nuclear war, it's the famous Gorbachev\nand Reagan joint statement. A nuclear war cannot be won\nand must never be fought. But before that, many people\nbelieved that it could be won, and they were preparing for that. - Not to be political\nand not to be ageist, but do cognitive abilities and all that kind of\nstuff come into play here? So if so much is riding on the president, is there tests that are conducted? Is there regular training procedures on the president that you're aware of? Do you know? - I don't think that has\nanything to do with ageism. I think it's an earnest\nquestion, a really powerful one, and if people were to ask\nthat question of themselves, or their sort of dinner party guests, or their family around\nthe dinner table guests, you might come to a real good conclusion about how bad our political system is and how bad our\npresidential candidates are. Because why on earth there\nwould be two candidates, one of whom has cognitive problems, and the other of whom\nhas judgment problems. These are the two biggest issues with the nuclear launch,\njudgment and cognition. And so where's the young-ish, thoughtful, forward-looking wise, dedicated civil servant running for president? I know that sounds fantastical, but I wish it weren't. - So that's one of the things\nyou should really think about when voting for president,\nis this scenario that we've been describing,\nthese six minutes. Imagine the man or woman\nsitting there for six minutes waiting for the pot of coffee. - But I think about that issue with any war, I mean, prior to writing \"Nuclear War, A Scenario\",\nI previously wrote six books on military and intelligence programs\ndesigned to prevent nuclear war. And I believe, the president\nas commander in chief, should be of the highest\ncharacter possible, because the programs, the wars that we have fought since\nWorld War ii have all been, how many octogenarian\nsources have I interviewed? I'm talking about Nobel\nlaureates, and weapons designer, and spy pilots, and engineers in general, they've all said to me with great pride, we prevented World War\niii, nuclear World War iii. But that idea that the commander in chief and everyone within the\nnational security apparatus, should be making really\ngood decisions about war, it's the oldest cliche in the world that the wars are fought by the young kids, and that is not a cliche, it's true. And so the character\npart about the president should be in play whether we're\nthinking about nuclear war or any war, in my opinion. - Well, I agree with you first of all, but it feels like when nuclear war, one person becomes, like\nexponentially more important, with regular war, the\ndecision to go to war or not, advisors start mattering\nmore, there's judgment issues. You could start to make arguments for sort of more leeway in terms of what kind of people we elect. It seems like with nuclear\nwar, there's no leeway, it's like one person can resist the jamming the president\nforce, the war mongers, all the calculation\ninvolved in considering what are the errors, the mistakes, the missiles flying over\nRussia, the full dynamics of the geopolitics going on in the world, consider all of humanity,\nthe history of humanity, the future of humanity, all of it just loaded\nin to make a decision, then it becomes much more important that your cognitive abilities are strong and your judgment abilities against powerful, wise people just as a human being are strong. So I think that's something\nto really, really consider when you vote for president. But to which degree is it\nreally on the president versus to the people advising. - Oh no, it's on the president, the president has to make the call. And that six minute\nwindow happens so fast, I mean, the president is gonna be being moved for part of that time, the Secret Service is gonna\nbe up against Stratcom, Stratcom saying, we\nneed the launch orders, and the Secret Service is gonna be saying, we need to move the president. So it's not as much that\nhe's delegating the issues, it's more like the issue\nis being postponed, because there is only one issue, for the president to say these targets, for him to choose from the Denny's menu, okay, this is what we're gonna go with. And then this astonishing thing happens, the president takes out his wallet, he has a card in it that's\ncolloquially called the biscuit, and that card with the\ncodes matches up an item in the briefcase in the football, that then is received by an\nofficer underneath the bunk, underneath the Pentagon in that bunker, it's a call and response,\nLex, it's like alpha zeta, that's it, and then back so that the individual in the bunker\nrealizes they are getting the command from the president. And then that order is passed to Stratcom. And Stratcom, the commander of Stratcom, and I interviewed a former\ncommander of Stratcom, commander of Stratcom then follows orders, which is he delivers the launch orders to the nuclear triad. And what's done is done. - What would you do if\nyou were the commander of Stratcom in that\nsituation, what would you do? Because my gut reaction right now, if you just throw me in\nthere, I would refuse orders. - Okay, so good question,\nI asked that exact question to one of my very helpful\nsources on the book, Dr. Glenn McDuff, who is at Los Alamos, and who for a while was the classified, they have a museum that's\nclassified within the lab, and he was the historian in charge of it. So he's a nuclear weapons engineer, he worked on Star Wars\nduring the Reagan era, and he does a lot having\nto do with the history of Los Alamos, and by the way, the Oppenheimer movie really, 'cause I've reported on nuclear\nweapons for 12 years now, and Oppenheimer movie had a very, to me, positive impact on Los Alamos's transparency with people like me. They had a real willingness\nto share information. I think before, perhaps\nthey were on their heels feeling they needed to\nbe on the defensive, but now they're much more forthcoming, they were super helpful. I can tell you the origin\nstory of the football, which they declassified for the book. But I asked this question\nto Dr. Glenn McDuff, like in a different manner, I said, \"Is there a chance that\nthe Stratcom commander would defy orders? And he said, \"Annie, you have a better chance\nwinning Powerball.\" - Why do you think, what's\nhis intuition behind that? - You don't wind up a Stratcom commander unless you are someone who follows orders. You follow orders. - You don't think there's\na deep humanity there? Because his intuition is about everything we know so\nfar, but this situation has never happened in\nthe history of earth. - All right, so you're\nraising a really tricky, interesting conundrum\nhere, because during COVID, when President Trump and\nthe leader of North Korea were kind of locked in\nvarious relationships with one another, good, bad, threatening, non-threatening, friendly,\njust bananas you might say, like not presidential behavior. If you were someone\nwatching c-span like I do, nerding out on what Stratcom was actually saying about all this, you noticed that Stratcom\ncommanders were speaking out publicly to Congress more so than I had ever seen before. And this issue came up, would\nyou defy presidential order? So the caveat, I would\nsay, to Mcduff's answer of easier to win the Powerball, is that if the commander of Stratcom interpreted the president's behavior to be unreliable, to be non-presidential, then dot dot dot, but now you're into some really radical territory. - Well, I mean, fundamentally, it feels like just looking\nat all the presidents of the United States in my lifetime, it feels like none of them are qualified for this six minutes. I could see as being the\ncommander of Stratcom and being like, this guy, like basically respecting no president. I know you're supposed to\nthe commander in chief, but in this situation, saying like, I mean, everybody, Bush,\nObama, Trump, Biden, if I was a commander of\nStratcom, I would be like, what does this guy know about any of this? I would defy orders, I\nmean, in this situation, when the future of human civilization hangs in the balance, I mean, to be the person that says, yes, launch, no matter what, I just can't\nsee a human being on earth being able to do that in the\nUnited States of America. That's a hell of a\ndecision, like, this is it, that's it.\n- That's it. - Well, but now you've raised a great important presentation essentially, because what you're\nsaying is people be aware, be aware of like why you're voting or why certain individuals\nare being escalated to even being able to run for president. What does that mean? Why are people in America\nnot more involved? As citizens, do we have a\nresponsibility for that? Because you've opened up the\ndoor for people to understand, okay, the ultimate thing is\nthe nuclear launch decision. So if a person can't be trusted with that, everything unravels from there. - Also, I wanna look up who's\nthe commander of Stratcom now. (Lex giggling) Speaking of which, you've interviewed a lot of experts for this book. Is there some commonalities about the way, you've talked about this a little bit, but in the way they see\nthis whole situation, what like scares them the most about this whole system and the whole\npossibility of nuclear war? - I first learned about nuclear\nweapons from a guy called Al O'Donnell, who appears\nin my earlier books, because I interviewed\nhim for over a period of four and a half years,\nbecause he was an engineer who actually wired nuclear\nbombs in the 1950s. He was a member of the\nManhattan Project in 1946, worked on Operation Crossroads, the first explosions of nuclear\nbombs after the war ended, after World War II ended, and went on to arm, wire, and fire 186 out of the 200 some odd atmospheric nuclear tests that the United States did before this was banned. And so I learned from him\nthe power of these weapons. And I learned from him this very, almost nationalistic\nidea about how important it was to have nuclear weapons. And while I learned a\nlot about his human side, I also saw the side of him\nthat was very Cold War warrior. So he was kind of the first,\nand then, I don't know, there've been a hundred\npeople that have been directly involved in nuclear\nweapons along the way. Billy Waugh, who was my subject of my main sort of central figure in a book I wrote about\nthe CIA's paramilitary called \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\". And Waugh HALO jumped a tactical nuclear weapon\ninto the Nevada test site with a small team,\nalmost unknown to anyone. Only recently declassified. And so his position was like, tactical nuclear weapons\nmay end up being used. So I'm trying to speak here to the scope of different people I have\ninterviewed over the years. And what has happened is, as I've gotten closer to\nthe present day in arrears, there seems to be a growing movement from some of these cold warriors, off the position of nuclear weapons make us great and strong, toward something must be done to reduce this threat. - How much do you know, in the same way that you\nknow about the United States, how much do you know\nabout the Russian side, maybe the Chinese side, Indian, Pakistan, all of this, like how their\nthinking differs perhaps? - Yes, well, for that, you\nwanna go to the experts. So for Russia, for example, there's a guy called Pavel Podvig, who is probably the West's top expert on Russian nuclear forces. He works in parallel with the UN, he also studied in Moscow. So my information comes from him, like you do all the footwork\nto know what questions to ask, and then you take the very\nspecific questions to him. And I learned from him about how the Russian command\nand control goes down. And it's very similar to ours, because America and Russia have been at sort of nuclear dueling with one another for 75 years now, and so\neverything we have, they have, with the exception of we\nhave a great satellite system and they have a super flawed\none, theirs is called Tundra, and even Pavel Podvig admitted that there's serious flaws in Tundra. The Russian satellite system, for example, can mistake sunlight for flames, can mistake clouds for a\nnuclear launch, this is a fact. And what was interesting\nin interviewing him was also this recent very, very dangerous shift in Russian nuclear\npolicy, which is this, many Russian experts will tell you that Russia has always maintained that it never had a\nlaunch on warning policy. Now, I don't know if\nI believe that's true, but I'm just telling you what they say. And this is coming from the generals, the Cold War generals\nin Soviet Russia saying, \"Oh, no, no, no, we would wait,\" they were kind of playing\nthe noble warrior, \"we would wait to absorb a nuclear attack until we launched.\" So many American experts will tell you that that's just posturing and propaganda, but that was their official position. And that changed just two years ago when Putin gave a speech, and he said that their\nposition had changed, that they will no longer\nwait to absorb an attack, once they learn of, how did he phrase it? He called it like the\ntrajectory of the missiles, which is a way of talking about parody, the same way we see the missile\ncoming over in midcourse, Putin made that same statement\nand said we would launch. - What do you know of the way Putin thinks about nuclear weapons and nuclear war? Is it just something to\nallude to in a speech or do you think he contemplates the possibilities of nuclear war? - I don't know, but if I had\nto guess it would go like this, I would look at his background, and he comes from the intelligence world. So my experience in\ninterviewing old timers who've spent decades working\nfor the CIA, or even NRO, or NSA, I know the way they think from having spent hundreds\nof hours interviewing them. And then I know the way that military men think, and\nit's very different. So Putin's not a military person per se, he's an intelligence officer. So what would concern me there, if I had to guess about his mindset, has to do with paranoia. Most intelligence officers\nmust have a degree of healthy paranoia or\nthey're gonna wind up dead. And so that's not a great quality to have. - You would be more trigger happy perhaps. So you would be more prone to respond to erroneous signals. - And you'd be suspicious,\nand you can see that now. There's such a incredible distrust and sort of real conflict between Russia, between its leader and NATO, between its leader and all of the west. And then that is fueled by his closest advisors, kind of, they seem to be, from the\nstatements they have made that I've read in translation,\nthey seem to be fostering that same idea that NATO really has it in for Russia, America really has it in, and that is so dangerous\nand disheartening. - And perhaps makes it less likely that the president would pick up the phone and talk to the other president. - Or that the close\nadvisors near the president would make that happen. - You were talking about the\nprocedure with the football. Is there any concern for cyber attacks, for sort of security concerns at every level here, false signals, errors, shutting down the\nchannels of communication through cyber attacks,\nall that kind of stuff? - So to answer those questions, I interviewed a number of people, but most specifically General Touhill, who was Obama's Cyber Chief, and he was actually\nAmerica's first cyber chief. And the nuclear command\nand control system, and really the triad, functions on analog systems, it functions on old school systems, if there's not digital interface,\nyou can't hack into it. So most of the issues\nthat I raise in the book have to do with what happens to cyber after a nuclear attack. What happens to cyber in the minutes after a bomb, a nuclear weapon strikes America? And how that impacts the ability for people to communicate\nwith one another. And that's when chaos takes control. - Well, let's talk about it. So God forbid, if a nuclear weapon reaches its target, what happens? Perhaps you could say what you think would be the first target\nhit, would it be the Pentagon? - I was told by many people I interviewed that the biggest fear in Washington DC is what's called a bolt\nout of the blue attack. That's an unwarranted nuclear\nattack against Washington DC. The target would be the Pentagon, and that's what I begin the scenario with. And I reported in graphic, horrifying detail what happens. - Yes you did.\n- Because I don't know what's worse, me writing that all out or the fact that it's all documented\nby the defense department. I mean, they have been\ndocumenting the effect of nuclear weapons on people,\nand animals, and things since the earliest days of the Cold War. And all of the details I pull\nare from these documents, like the effects of nuclear weapons. And again, this document was\nthe original information, the original data in this document come from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was all classified,\nand then it was built upon by those 200 some odd atmospheric nuclear weapons test we did. And we're talking about\nlike millimeters and inches, we're talking about the defense\ndepartment knowing that, oh, seven and a half miles out, the upholstery on cars\nwill spontaneously combust, the pine needles will catch on fire, they will start more fires. You have all kinds of\nmayhem and chaos happening based on reported facts from observations. And this is really shocking and grotesque at the same time. - So one warhead reaches the Pentagon, everybody in the Pentagon parishes. - 180 million degrees. The fireball on a one\nmegaton nuclear weapon is 19 football fields of fire. Think about that, nothing remains. Nothing remains. - And there's then a radius where people die immediately, and then there's people\nthat are dead when found. And then there's people\nthat will die slowly. - Yes.\n- And eccentric rings. - And again, rings defined\nby defense scientists, but before that, the bomb goes off, then there's this blast wave that's like several hundred miles an hour, pushing out like a bulldozer,\nknocking everything down. Bridges, buildings, I mean, you can read FEMA manuals about what\nthe rubble will be like, you're talking about 30 feet deep rubble as the buildings go over\n6, 7, 8, 10 miles out. That speaks nothing of the mega\nfires that will then ensue. So once all these people die, and third degree radiation burns, did you even know there was such a thing as fourth degree radiation burns? We're talking about the\nwind ripping the skin off people's faces many miles out. And then you have a sucking action, many people are familiar with what the nuclear mushroom\ncloud looks like, and its stem actually creates, and again, this is from physicists who advise the defense department on this, the sucking up into the nuclear stem, 300 mile an hour winds,\nyou're talking about people miles out getting sucked\nup into that stem. When you see the mushroom cloud, Lex, in a nuclear war, that would be people, those are like the remnants of people and of things in the cloud, 30, 40 mile wide mushroom cloud blocking out the sun,\nand that speaks nothing of the radiation poisoning that follows. - And then the power grid goes out. Basically everything we rely on in terms of systems in\nour way of life goes out. You write, quote, \"Those\nwho somehow manage to escape death by the\ninitial blast, shockwave, and firestorm suddenly\nrealize an insidious truth about nuclear war, that\nthey're entirely on their own. Here begins a, quote,\n'Fight for food and water.'\" I mean, that is a wake up call on top of a wake up call, that we go back to a kind of primitive fight for survival each on their own. - And by the way, those\ndetails were given to me by Obama's FEMA director, Craig Fugate. So FEMA is the agency in America\nthat plans for nuclear war, and what Fugate said to me was, \"Annie, we plan for asteroid strikes, these are called low probability, but high consequence events.\" And FEMA is the organization that when there's a\nhurricane, or an earthquake, or a flood, FEMA steps in, and they do what's called\npopulation protection planning. They take care of people. And what Fugate told me\nis, after a nuclear strike, after a bolt out of the blue\nattack, he used those terms, there is no population\nprotection, everyone's dead. And he means that metaphorically, but also kind of more literally, because he just said, \"At that point, you just hope that you stocked Pedialyte.\" - What do you think happens to humans? Like how does human nature manifest itself in such conditions? Do you think like brutality will come out, like people will, just for survival, will steal, will murder? - I can't imagine that not happening, I think that's why people\nlove post-apocalyptic television shows and films,\nbecause they see that, and then of course, there's\nalways one great charismatic person who's trying to restore morality. And these are great\nnarratives that people like to tell themselves in the\nworld of science fiction. But what we're dealing\nwith is science fact in this scenario, and it is meant to terrify people into\nrealizing, wait a minute, this is a conversation that\nabsolutely should be had while it can still be had. Because the reality is,\nwhen you have the director of FEMA telling you this,\nit's a real wake up call. And by the way, Craig Fugate was so transparently human with me, and I quote him directly in the book, but he spoke about, you\nasked me earlier about, like what would be going\nthrough the president's mind, and we don't know, I don't know, but Craig Fugate told me what would be going through his mind. And he said along the\nlines, I'm paraphrasing, \"Like it's almost something\nyou couldn't even comprehend, it would just like ruin you.\" His words are really\npowerful, and of course, the FEMA director in the scenario is notified in that first window, while the ballistic missile is on its way and no one in America yet knows, and I have the FEMA director\npull over to the side of the road and jump in\na helicopter sent for him to take him to the\nbunker that FEMA goes to, which is called Mount Weather. And so Fugate was aware\nthat as FEMA director you would likely be taken to a safe place, however many hours you're gonna be safe, or days, or maybe weeks, or maybe months. But as I also learned from the\ncyber people I interviewed, that there's a complete fallacy that these military bases\ncan continue functioning. They run on diesel fuel, and when the fuel stops pumping,\nthere's no more generators. - Electricity's gone, communication lines are all gone, the food supply, all of it, all the supply chains gone. It's terrifying. And that's just in the first few days, first few hours. In part five, you described the 24 months and beyond after this first\nhour we've been talking about. So what happens to earth,\nwhat happens to humans if a full on nuclear war happens? - So for that, I was super privileged to talk to Professor Brian Toon, who is one of the original five authors of the nuclear winter theory. And that theory was developed in, was published in the early 1980s. One of Professor Toon's\nprofessors was Carl Sagan, who was sort of the most famous author of the nuclear winter theory. And there were all kinds of controversies about it when it came out, including the Defense Department saying it was Soviet propaganda, which it wasn't. And what the nuclear winter authors conceded back in the eighties was that their modeling was just the best it could be based on what\nthey had at the time. And so now flash forward\nto where we are in 2024, and talking to professor\nToon, who's been working on this issue for all these decades since, he shared with me how the climate models today\nwith the systems we have, the computer systems reveal that actually nuclear winter is worse. So to answer your questions, the bombs stop falling, in my scenario, 72 minutes after they first launch, the bombs stop falling, and\nthen the mega fires begin. Each nuclear weapon will have, according to the Defense Department, a mega fire that will burn\nbetween 100 and 300 square miles. So 1,000 weapons, 1,500 weapons, think about those mega fires. Everything is burning, forests, cities, think about the pyro toxins in all the cities, high rises burning. And all of this soot\ngets lofted into the air, according to Toon, some 300 billion pounds of soot. And what happens, it blocks out the sun. And without sun, we have nuclear winter, we have a situation whereby ice sheets form, you're talking about bodies of water in places like Iowa being frozen for 10 years. - So temperature drops. - Temperature plummets. And there are all kinds of papers that have been written about this, using modern systems. And the numbers vary, but the bottom line is agriculture fails. - Foods obviously dies. So the agriculture system\ncompletely shuts down, so the food sources shut down. So there's no food, there's no sun, temperature drops\ncompletely, no electricity. - And we haven't even spoken\nof radiation poisoning, because the radiation\npoisoning kills many people in the aftermath of the nuclear exchange. But after the nuclear freeze ends, after nuclear winter, after\nthe sun starts to come back, let's say 8, 9, 10 years, now you have no ozone layer, or you have a severely\ndepleted ozone layer, and so the sun's rays are now poisonous. So if you have people living underground, and you have this great thawing, and with that great thawing\ncomes pathogens and plague, and you have this system where\nthe small bodied animals, the insects and whatnot begin\nreproducing really fast, and the larger body\nanimals, like you and me, begin to go extinct. Professor Toon said it\nto me this way, he said, \"66 million years ago,\nan asteroid hit earth, killed all the dinosaurs and wiped out 70% of the species, and nuclear\nwar would likely do the same.\" And so here we are talking about this because there is a difference. There's nothing you can\ndo about an asteroid, but there is something you\ncan do about a nuclear war. - Do you think it's\npossible that some humans will survive all of this? So if we look, I mean,\nhow long would it be? Would it be decades? Would it be centuries before the earth starts to have the\ncapacity to grow food again? - Carl Sagan talked about\nthat in this amazing book that he wrote with two\nscientist colleagues called \"The Cold and the Dark\". And there's a bunch of\nessays about exactly this, like what would happen and\nhow long would it take? It's really interesting, it's dated, it's from the eighties,\nbut man, is it shocking. And you think about that where, okay, so men return to sort of the worst, most base versions of\nthemselves, civilization is gone, meaning civil society,\nthere's no rule of law, it's just fend for yourself. There's people fighting\nover what little resources there are, man returns to\na hunter gatherer state. And to really think about\nthis idea, I looked at the oldest known archeological\nsite in the world in Turkey, which is called Gobekli Tepe. And it's really fascinating to me, because I interviewed one\nof the two archeologists who first found this site\nin the early nineties. And the lead archeologist was\na guy named Klaus Schmidt, and Michael Morsch was\nthe young graduate student who was with him. And Morsch's description\nof like coming upon this like rumored to be site, there was something called\na wishing tree on the site, which I just found so human and perfect that it was this magical\nplace and it was locatable, because there was a\nwishing tree on a hill, and it's where people went to wish and to hope that their wishes came true, I mean, how human is that? And that is where,\nbeneath the wishing tree, kind of like in the shadow\nof the wishing tree, there was a tepe, which is a hill. And beneath that, there\nis the oldest known civilization in the\nworld, 12,000 years ago, a group of hunter\ngatherers built this site, why, we don't know. But I imagined through\nMorsch's descriptions of coming upon, like he tripped on a rock, he told me, he tripped over a stone that turned out to be the top part of a 12,000 year old sculpted man, giant pillar. And he talked about coming upon that, and then no one knows really\nwhat Gobekli Tepe was for. And that makes my mind try and answer the question you asked me internally. Just as like a human who's here on earth for the amount of time I'm here, like if there were a nuclear\nwar, what would it be like? What would it be like when\nsomeone in the future, would we become archeologists one day? Would civilization rebuild? Would we develop computers? Who knows, it's\ninteresting to think about, I hope we never have to. - What would we remember about this time? It is terrifying to think that most of it will be forgotten. Everything we kind of assume\nwill not be forgotten. We think maybe some of the\ntechnological developments will be forgotten, but we assume, like some of history won't be forgotten. But realistically, especially us descending into primitive survival, probably everything\nsince the industrial age will be forgotten, like everything. Maybe some religious ideas will persist, some stories and myths will persist. But like all the wisdom we've gathered, higher level sort of technological\nwisdom would be gone. Like that's terrifying to think about. And like, maybe even, as you touch on, the very fact of nuclear\nwar might be forgotten, like the lessons of nuclear\nwar might be forgotten. That there are these weapons, sort of the obvious elephant in the room would be one of the things\nthat's completely forgotten, or become so vague in the\nrecollection of humans that our understanding will change. It's almost as if a God descended on earth and destroyed everything,\nmaybe that's how it'll persist. Sort of like mythological interpretation of what nuclear weapons are. That's terrifying, 'cause\nthen it could repeat again. - But I think for me, the idea of what is buried becomes very\ninteresting and very human, and in a strange way,\noptimistic and positive. Because if you can\nvisualize that wishing tree, and I have a picture of it in the book from one of the archeologists\nwho work on that. You think, what were they wishing? What were they wishing for? And then you think of your own self, what do I wish for in this world? Because I do think all things come from what happens metaphorically around the dinner table. Like what people put their eyes on becomes interesting and\nexpands what people talk about. And ultimately, when you think\nabout the long arc of time and human civilization,\nit does kind of make you wanna communicate more with your enemies, with your adversaries. And I think about the quote, what Einstein has said to have said, which is that he was asked what weapons World War\nIII would be fought with. And he said, \"I don't know, but I know that World\nWar IV will be fought with sticks and stones.\" - Lemme ask you about the Great Filter. When you look up into our galaxy, into our universe, look up at the sky, do you think there's\nother alien civilizations that are contending with\nsome similar questions? And perhaps the reason we have not definitively seen alien civilizations is because the others have failed to find a solution to this great filter, something like nuclear weapons? - I'm not sure, I'm gonna have\nto think about that question. But what does come to mind is an answer that was given to me similarly, by Ed Mitchell who went to the moon. And he was the sixth\nman to walk on the moon. And so his opinion, I think\nmight count a little more than mine on that subject, because his lens is so much greater. And Mitchell was vilified when he got back from the moon, because it became known that he believed in things like extrasensory perception, and this kind of mystical, metaphysical way of looking at the world. And he really suffered from that, I mean, he was ridiculed and he lost a lot of his career and his friends. But what he said to me in our interview about his trip home from the moon answers that great filter question, I think in a way I might wanna adopt. Which is this, that he said that, as they were returning\nfrom the moon to earth, he looked down at the earth, and I'm paraphrasing him, I write all this in \"Phenomena\", an earlier book, but the paraphrasing is that\nhe looked down from the earth, and it was 1971, and he\nthought about all the conflict going on down below,\nparticularly the Vietnam War where many of his friends were. And then he looked behind\nhim into the great vast galaxy, and he had a moment, he says, that was like an epiphany, like not a near death experience, but a sort of near life experience, where he believed that\nthe human consciousness, which is where so much\nof this thoughtfulness about metaphysics and ESP perhaps come from. Mitchell's theory was\nthat human consciousness, the way to understand\nit had something to do with realizing that man's inner life and man's outer life are deeply connected, in the same way that man\nis connected to the galaxy. And he said it much more eloquently, but you kind of get the idea, and I think it's why humans have always loved to look up. That there's more there, and\nit's a bit like the wish, it's like the big version\nof the wishing tree. What do I wish for, for myself? And what is maybe perhaps\nthe realignment of thinking for those of us in search of happiness, instead of war is, what does it mean to have a conscience, to have consciousness? What does it mean to be a thinking person? What does it mean to be on this earth, to be born, to live, to die? And then there is legacy,\nand so all of those ideas, I think, foster the kind of conversation that deescalates conflict. - Yeah, so in some deep way, so the mysteries of what's out there when we look out to the\nstars are the same mysteries that we find when trying to\nunderstand the human mind. And they're coupled in some way. For me, thinking about alien\ncivilizations out there is really the same kind\nof question, which is, what are we, what is this? What are we doing here? How did we come here? Why does it seem to be so magical and beautiful and powerful? Where's it going? Because it feels like we're really, perhaps the first time in history are in a moment where we\ncan destroy ourselves. And so naturally you ask, well, where's others like us? Is it perhaps, are we inevitably going to a place where\nwe'll destroy ourselves? Is it basically inevitable\nthat we destroy ourselves, we become too powerful? And insufficiently wise to know what to do with that power, But like you said, probably the\nanswers to that are in here. We don't need to look out there. I'd love to ask you about\nthe extrasensory perception. You've written, like you said, the book \"Phenomena\" on the secret history of the US government's investigations into extrasensory perception\nand psychokinesis. What are some of the more\ninteresting extrasensory abilities that were explored by the government, and maybe just in\ngeneral, ESP, what is it? What do you know of it? - The book was so interesting to report, because I spend so much\ntime dealing with like, mechanized systems,\nmachines, war machines, and yet the military\nand intelligence were, and continue to be incredibly interested in the human mind, in consciousness. And so if one is called hard science, this, what we're talking about now is called squishy science. And it was really interesting\nto delve into that world, it just couldn't be farther from weapons and war or could it? And then I really began thinking, well, before science and technology, sort of the supernatural ruled the world, the oracle of Delphi in Greece exists before the common error rulers to go and beg to learn from the powers that be what was going to happen. So all ESP programs, I think, pull from that origin story. The leader's desire to know. And so I really found it amazing that many people think these systems, or rather these programs\nstarted in the seventies, I learned they actually began\nright after World War ii. And that was because, and in my reporting, I find all things sort\nof always circle back to the Third Reich, to the Nazis. The Nazis had a massive occult program, an ESP program, psychokinesis\nprogram, astrology, both Hitler and Himmler\nwere deeply interested in these occult concepts. I learned from records\nat the National Archives that after the war, half of everything went\nto the Soviets Union, and I'm talking about the\ntrove of Nazi documents from which the superpowers were then going to learn to fight future wars, and half of them went\nto the United States. And so we got this trove of documents about all of this, and\nthe Soviets got the other, and so it set off a kind\nof psychic arms race, which in a weird way paralleled\nthe nuclear arms race, which we've been talking about, in as much that it led one side to constantly wonder\nwhat the other side had. - Have they been able to\nfind anything interesting in this squishy science analysis of trying to see how the human mind could be used as a weapon? - The CIA most definitely believed, from my reading of the documents, that there was something very legit, shall we say, about ESP. It was uncontrollable, it was unreliable, but nonetheless it existed. And being the intelligence\nagency that they are, they cared less about why it worked, they just wanted to know\nhow they could use it. And then it got into all kinds of elements of placebo effect. And when the military stepped in and got involved in the programs, that was a complete\ndisaster in my opinion, because the military needs\nto control everything in a mechanized, systematic way. And so they started, for\nexample, teaching people to be psychic, which is a\nreally, really, really bad idea. Flash forward to where we are today, these programs still exist, there's a navy program\nwhich is working on, based on a lot of data\nthat came back from the war on terror with certain soldiers knowing, wait, don't walk down that\npath, there is an IED there. And they call this the spidey sense, and they actually have a\nprogram that works from this. So these things never go away, they kind of circle around in terms of being made fun of and then taken seriously and a little of this and of that. My biggest takeaway from writing that book was a quote that I\nreferenced in the beginning, which is the Thomas theorem, and it says, \"If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences.\" - Yeah, I mean, placebo,\nas you've mentioned, is a fascinating concept. By the way, a short plug,\nI started listening to it, Andrew Huberman just released a podcast on placebo, the placebo effect. - Does he know the\norigin story of placebo? We'll have to ask him. - We'll have to ask him.\n- But, are you ready for this? CIA.\n(Lex laughing) And not only that, I can tell\nyou that Dr. Henry Beecher, Harvard, I think he was\nalso at MIT for a bit, he came up with that term, and you might even say for the CIA. - Does that trouble you\nthat so much of this is coming from the CIA first? - You mean the placebo concept or the- - The placebo concept, but a lot of the sort of\nscientific investigations. - Listen, I have such mixed\nfeelings about the CIA, as one should, I think you\nshould have mixed feelings about anything that you\ncover as a reporter, or as a human, and maybe change that from mixed to conflicting. Because there are really positive elements of every organization within\nthe federal government. I mean, my first learning about the CIA came from the work I did\non the \"Area 51\" book about their aerial\nreconnaissance programs, which were set up, again,\nto prevent World War iii. Nuclear World War iii, it was this idea that information was king. The U-2 spy plane was\ndeveloped out at Area 51, and I interviewed Hervey Stockman, the first man to fly over\nthe Soviet Union in a U-2. Gathered all this\nintelligence, prevented wars. Later I wrote a book about\nthe CIA's paramilitary, \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\". So like, just when I was thinking, wow, the CIA is doing all this amazing non-kinetic activity with\naerial reconnaissance, then you learn about their kill programs, and that's a whole\ndifferent set of issues. - It turns out, as you write in that book, that the CIA assassinates\npeople sometimes, and we'll talk about it. But anyway, like you said,\nconflicting feelings. - I mean, I work with\nsources to report my books, and so put yourself in my shoes. I interview for dozens\nor hundreds of hours, my primary sources, in the case of the \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\" book, I traveled with Billy Waugh, the longest serving CIA operator, back to the scene of the crime, back to the battle, we went\nto Hanoi, we went to Havana. And you really get to know someone, and that's when I say conflicting, I work with sources on a real trust basis, and sometimes people will\ntell me things, they'll say, \"Annie, this is off the record, this is for you to know about me on deep background because I\nwant you to know who I am.\" And that's powerful, and a\nlot of times it's personal, it's personal, it's about\ntheir personal life. And it isn't apropos to\nwhat I'm writing about, but I need to know that,\nand that's where it gets conflicted, because you, in a good way, because you realize where we're all such creatures of our personal lives. So you have a professional life where your national\nsecurity are in your hands. I don't know what that is like. - I wonder if you could\njust speak to that. You've interviewed so\nmany powerful people, so many fascinating people. And as you've spoken about, trust is fundamental to that. So they open up and really\nshow you into their world. What does it take to do that? - I think willingness, we were talking about trust earlier, I have to trust that there's a reason I find myself in a certain situation. Otherwise, it would just be a constant doubt paradox, why am I\nhere, what am I doing? And so I trust that I'm going to learn something of value. And so I'm willing to listen, I really am willing to listen. And so far it's always proven, the expectations I might have going into something are dwarfed by the outcome, because people are so interesting, and because the people that I interview, because I write about war, and weapons, and national security,\nand government secrets, and the people I interview are\nat the heart of all of this. I mean, they are really capable people, intellectually brilliant,\nphysically capable. They go so far out on the\nlimb to do their jobs. And by the way, the reason\nthey're talking to me is 'cause they're still alive, and so many of their colleagues are dead. So it gives them also a wisdom about life, about sacrifice, not in cliched, sort of nationalistic\njingoistic terms whatsoever. I'm talking like real, real, what is their real truth? When I went to Vietnam with Billy Waugh, I mean, so much of it was, the details are just, every detail, I mean, starting with the fact that he showed up at my house\nwith a giant suitcase and a bunch of clothes, dry cleaning, pressed clothes in plastic\nhangers, carrying them. I'm like, \"Billy, we're going to Vietnam and we're going back into the jungle to find the Oscar Eight battle site, like, what are you carrying?\" And he got really mad at me, he did not like anyone correcting him. And I got my husband on the job, like, Kevin, you gotta sort this out. And what transpired was that Billy Waugh had never taken a trip\nfor personal reasons. He operated, I think in 62 countries, every single time for the CIA. And it would go like this, Billy, go to there and get to there. And that's what he would\ndo, and when he arrived, whatever he needed, he would just get. It's not a fashion trip, so he had no idea how to\npack for an overseas trip, this was like, oh my God, how can you not have the hugest smile on your face going into this? I'm with a guy who's 89 years\nold, he's got eight bullet, he's had eight purple hearts from Vietnam. I mean, he operated\nagainst Osama Bin Laden 10 years before 9/11. He went after Bin Laden in\nAfghanistan when he was 72. And he went after Kadafi\nduring the Arab Spring when he was 82, and now here\nhe is with me going Hanoi. The details, those human details. But my husband repacked his bag, and got him a proper\nsuitcase that was carryable and small and didn't have the hangers, he wasn't trailing the hangers, but it was the trip home in the taxi that I got at this really big reveal. Billy reached into that\nsmall suitcase my husband had given him and pulled out\na rolled up American flag. And he had taken this flag, 'cause I had tried to help him\npack and he wouldn't let me, and I just thought it was like\nan old guy being stubborn, but he didn't want me to see that he was bringing an\nAmerican flag to Vietnam, which is not legal. And he wanted to bring that flag and take it around everywhere with him, as he explained to me later,\nto honor all of his friends who died there 50 years ago. And then when the trip was finished, he gave me that flag\nand it's in my office. And that's the kind of\nrelationship that you can develop with people as a reporter\nif you're willing to go the extra mile\nwith them, to trust them, that they'll tell you things of value. And to me, something\nlike that is as of value as any secret mission I'm\nable to get declassified, because we are a nation of people. - And probably there's\na bunch of human details that you can't possibly express in words, things left unspoken, but\nyou saw in the silence, exchange between the\ntwo of you, the sadness. Maybe you could see on his\nface, looking back at memories of the people he is lost,\nall that kind of stuff. - All that kind of stuff. - You mentioned you\nwrote a book on Area 51, for people who don't know, you've written a lot about security, the military, secrets,\nall of this kind of stuff. So Area 51 is one of the legendary centers of all of these kinds of topics. So high level first is, what is Area 51 as you understand it,\nas you've written about, the lore and the reality? - I think everybody wants\nto know about Area 51, because it's like this American enigma. It's like to some people\nit's the Shangri-La of testbed aerospace programs. And to others, it's the\nplace of captured aliens, and everything in between. I had the great fortune\nof interviewing 75 people who lived and worked at that base for extended periods of time. Mostly leading up to the nineties, because everything since\nthen is classified. So things get declassified after decades, not everything, but some, and that allows you to\npiece together stories. - So you talked to a lot of\npeople that worked there. What can you describe as the history of technological development\nthat went on there? - I mean, Area 51 is huge by the way, and it's a top secret military facility inside a top secret military facility, inside the Nevada test and training range, which is this massive,\nnot secret facility. So you're just talking about layers, talk about peeling the onion in reverse, and it began as a place\nto test the U-2 spy plane. And literally, the CIA set up shop there to build this plane away from the public eye. And then that led to\nanother espionage platform called the A-12 Oxcart, which is, anyone who's seen the X-Men movies knows about the SR-71,\nand that's a two-seater. And before that, there\nwas the A-12 Oxcart, and that was the CIA's\nstealth mock three spy plane. Think about that in the early 1960s, it's astonishing, and I\ninterviewed the pilots who flew it. - What did they say about it? What was it like?\n- Oh my God. I mean, look, I describe\nin detail in \"Area 51\", but also the amazing thing,\nLex, about that was that, and I just look back on\nthat with such fondness, this is like in 2009 when\nI was reporting that, and many of the guys who\nwere in their eighties and nineties were World War II heroes, like serious World War II\nheroes, like Colonel Slater, who was the commander of Area\n51, he flew the U-2 on the, the missions called\nthe Black Cat missions, over China in the early 1960s to see about their Lop\nNur nuclear facility. So all of these things tie\nin when you're reporting on military and intelligence programs, but these guys had been\nWorld War II heroes, and then were given this\ncushy job out at Area 51, and it just came with all these perks. Colonel Slater told me this\none perk, I just love so much, they all had a hankering\nfor lobster one day. And here they are in the\nmiddle of the desert in Nevada, and they have these really fast planes, and they literally called,\nlike they arranged, they didn't take the\nOxcart out for that one, but they got some lobsters\nfrom Massachusetts, like delivered to them\nin like record time, they didn't even need to put them on ice. And again, those are these\ndetails where you're like, thank God, at least for me,\nthank God I got these details, these guys are all passed now. - So there's a lot of\nincredible technological work going on there, so the legend, the lore, like you said, aliens, were there ever aliens in\nArea 51 as you understand it? - So I've interviewed hundreds of people. - That worked there. - Well, not just at Area 51, but in all the different national security and military intelligence\nand intelligence programs. And I personally have no reason to believe that aliens have ever visited earth, that's just me personally.\n- Visited earth, period. - I have no information that causes me to\nconclude that's the case. Now, with that said, many\nof the primary players in this present day, there are aliens among us narrative, are\nin my \"Phenomena\" book, I continue to communicate\nwith a lot of these people. I'm talking about astrophysicists, who fundamentally believe that\nthere are aliens among us. So we beg to differ on that issue. - But for you, in terms of doing research on government agencies that do top secret military work,\nI mean, they would know. So you have interviewed a lot of people at every layer of the onion. You don't see evidence or a reason to believe\nthat there was ever aliens or UFOs captured from out of this world? - That is correct, and even\nperhaps more important, and perhaps this colors my thinking, but I am uniquely familiar\nwith disinformation programs put forth by the CIA, or the agency as it's called by insiders. And I've learned firsthand\nabout these program, or rather learned from\nfirsthand participants in strategic deception\ncampaigns that the CIA has engaged in, beginning with Area 51. The idea that all these reports of this U-2 spy plane, this giant, long winged aircraft\nflying 70,000 feet up, people didn't think airplanes\ncould fly that high, and it's the sun shining off of it, it looked like a UFO, and\nall the reports coming in, and the CIA opened up a UFO disinformation campaign office, headed by a guy named Toto Otirenco, specifically for this reason. Now, does that mean\nthat every UFO sighting in the world has been a U-2? No, but I come from it\nfrom that lane of thinking, and there are so many\nstrategic deception campaigns, and as I look over the decades of how these same UFO stories, and again, this is just my\nopinion based on my reporting, this narrative that keeps reoccurring, it seems to me like a very large catchall to keep the public's attention\non that, not on that. - So to you, sexy stories like UFOs are going to be leveraged by the CIA\nfor strategic deception? - 100%, I mean, Google Paul Bennewitz, I'm always amazed that\nPaul Bennewitz' story is not more widely spoken of. And I think that's because people, there's like the sort of\nufologists or the people who are like absolutely convinced\nthat aliens are among us, and I use that term loosely,\nbut you know what I mean, and then there's the,\nquote unquote, \"skeptics\", and the skeptics tend to be\nsort of like self-righteous. And I would never wanna be self-righteous, so I'm not a skeptic, I'm just agnostic I suppose. But Google Paul Bennewitz, and you can learn the story of that man, who thought he saw a UFO in\nthe seventies, early eighties, and the Air Force, because the Air Force intelligence community works\nhand in glove with CIA a lot, and some of the other\nintelligence agencies, of course, there's 17, not just the CIA, and they destroyed Paul Bennewitz, they sent him to a mental institution, by pulling a massive\nstrategic deception campaign against him because they\ndidn't want him to know about the technology that he was seeing at Kirkland Air Force Base. So look that up, and\nthen you go, oh my God, and to my eye, you can apply any of these other names,\nsubstitute in Paul Bennewitz, or any of the current individuals who really become convinced of X, Y, or Z, when in fact there's a strategic deception campaign going on. - Yeah, there's a lot\nof incentive for the CIA and other intelligence agencies to get you to look the other way on whatever, well, whatever is happening. Plus, from a enemy perspective, whenever two nations are at war, to try to create hysteria in the other. - But then you have the Thomas theorem that becomes applicable there too. If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences. So this idea of like UFOs and we're being lied to, it becomes real to many people. And then that creates a\nwhole subset of problems, to the point where things\nare spiraling out of control. And there is no center anymore, so a lot of people that\nare briefed on programs maybe aren't even aware of their position within a greater campaign. Or I'm wrong and there\nare aliens among us. - Right, so I appreciate you, the possibility of acknowledging\nthat you might be wrong. From everything you know\nabout the US government, if there was an alien spacecraft, like what do you think would happen? Would they be able to hold onto those secrets for decades? Like, would they want to\nhold onto those secrets? Like what would they do? What's your sense? - I can't imagine that kind of exciting situation not\nbecoming public information. And the counter to that is this, which is, this is a very strong argument for why this is a big strategic\ndeception campaign. Think about the Defense Department, think about how jealously\nthey guard its airspace. I mean, you had a Chinese\nballoon flying over and the whole world went crazy. It was front page news. So the fact that one element, or a couple people in\nthe Defense Department have made this statement,\nwe've lost control of our airspace, over this UFO, alleged UFO craft that they can't explain. I don't buy that at all. Zero.\n- But of course it's possible that it is alien\nspacecraft, if it is that, and they operate under\na very different set of technologically capabilities in theory. - In my interviews with Jacques Vallee, who is the kind of\ngrandfather of all ufology, and he's such an interesting person and has such a really unique origin story about how he came into all of this, and he's such a scientist. And he is profoundly\ndedicated to this issue and stands completely on the opposite end of the spectrum from\nme, and knows a lot more and has studied this for decades more, but what he said to me is\nthe most interesting thing, which is that, \"It's\nnot a military problem, it's an intelligence problem.\" Because Jacques believes that this is some kind of intelligence, which really, the closest I can do to wrapping my head around that takes me to consciousness, the idea of what is consciousness. And I think that's where it\nbecomes very interesting. I think the government is\nhiding bodies and crafts is very Paul Bennewitz,\nread it, Google it, look into it.\n(Lex laughing) - Yeah, I think this kind\nof flying saucer thing is a trivialization of, if there's alien civilizations out there. - Trivialization, that's a great word, trivialization, I agree with you. - I tend to believe that there is, like a very large number of\nalien civilizations out there. And I believe we would\nhave trouble comprehending what that even looks\nlike, were they to visit. I tend to believe they are\nalready here or have visited and were too dumb to understand\nwhat that even means. And they certainly would not appear as flying objects to defy\ngravity for brief moments of time on low resolution video. I tend to have humility\nabout all this kind of stuff, but I think radical humility\nis required to even like, open your eyes to what\nan alien intelligence would actually look like. And to me, it's beyond\nmilitary applications, it's like the basic\nhuman question of like, what is even this thing, like you mentioned\nconsciousness that's going on. Like where does this come from? Why is it so powerful? Is it unique in the universe? I tend to believe not, of course, I hang out a bunch with other folks, like Elon who believe we are alone, but I think that belief, just like you said, has power, because it actually manifests itself in reality, so if you\nbelieve that we're alone in this universe, that's a great motivator to build rockets and\nbecome multi-planetary and save ourselves, especially\nin the case of nuclear war. Because otherwise whatever\nthe special sauce, this flame of consciousness will go out if we destroy ourselves on this earth. And for people like Elon,\nit's too high of a probability that we destroy ourselves on earth not to try to become multi-planetary. In your book on Area 51,\nyou propose an explanation that I think some people have\ncriticized at the very end, that this might have been a\ndisinformation campaign from, I guess Stalin, that the Roswell incident was a remotely piloted\nplane with a, quote, \"grotesque child size aviator.\" Just looking back at all\nthat now, years later, what's the probability that it's true? What's the probability it's not? - So I've never revealed to that sources. - Yes.\n- Did you know that? - I knew.\n- You want me to tell you? - What the source?\n- Yeah. - Okay, who was the source? - So before I say anything on that, let me speak to the\nquestion that you asked. So what you asked me,\nwhat's the probability that that is still standing as an idea, 12, 13, 14 years later. So I continued to work with that source for years afterwards,\nwe talked about this, look, I mean, his whole family knew it was him, and I knew his family, 'cause I was an integral part of, I was at his house, met\nall his kids, grandkids. - And we should say the source\nis the main expert advisor behind the story that it\nwas, maybe you can explain what the story is that\nyou report in the book, that it was a disinformation campaign created by Stalin to cause mass hysteria in the United States. - Yes.\n- That's the very kind that we've been speaking\nabout with the CIA and so on. - Yes, predicated on the narrative of the \"War of the Worlds\". And the \"War of the Worlds\",\nwhen it was a radio program in the United States,\nmade people go crazy, oh my God, we're being invaded by aliens. Well, the government was always\ninterested in this story, and Joseph Stalin was too, we know that from declassified documents. And so the source told me that the reason for this program and that the real Roswell\ncrash remains were, in fact, it was a black propaganda\nhoax infiltrated, or rather predicated at this idea that you were gonna overwhelm\nAmerica's early warning air defense system, cause mayhem, and maybe be able to\nattack the United States. That was the plan, and\nStalin was also messing with the United States,\nmessing with Truman, who sort of turned his\nback on him at Potsdam. And the reason that the\nsource is important, and unlike a lot of people,\nI saw this, I saw that, I learned that, was\naccording to the source, once it was determined\nthat this was a hoax and that Stalin was able to get a craft over the United States and it crashed, and it had people inside of it, they were people that\nwere sort of deformed and meant surgically\naltered to look like aliens, the United States government\ndecided that it needed to know what on earth that was all about, and if it was possible for\nus to have the same program. This according to the source. And so it sounds preposterous, and if it was just someone saying, you might say, well, it's ridiculous, get them onto another subject. But the difference was, is this source, who is very well placed and friends with all of the other 75 people, told me this as a confession. A real tearful confession, because what he said is he was involved in the American program\nto do the same thing, and people died because there were human experiments that went on. And I write about this in the\nlast 12 pages of \"Area 51\", it was a explosive revelation, and I felt very confident in writing this because the source wanted it written, why? Because he said, \"I'm\ndedicated to my country. I know about being committed\nto national security, and this kind of thing must never happen. And if you give people too much power, they would take advantage of it.\" And he wanted it on the record. And his wife of 60 years did not know until after the book published,\nnor did his children. So after the book published,\nI was called to his house and sat there with his family, and they said, \"Tell us this isn't true.\" And he said, \"It is true.\" Now, that source is Al O'Donnell, who is the nuclear weapons engineer who armed, wired, and fired 186 nuclear weapons. So if you wanna talk about somebody.\n- Ah. - And you're the first person\nI've told that on the record, but it's kind of about time. - Wow, well, you received a lot of criticism over this story and it confused me why, because given the context of\neverything you've described with the CIA and other\nintelligence agencies, it is reasonable that such\na action would be taken. - And the source is\nextraordinarily credible. If you wanted to take the position, well, that person isn't very reliable, then you have to ask\nyourself, why did they have top secret clearances\nthat are higher than any in the United States whatsoever? Because he was responsible\nfor arming nuclear bombs. He was called the trigger man. And by the way, he told\nme that I could tell the world who he was. There's a lot of details\nthat are really dark involving that program. And when is it appropriate? Well, it feels appropriate\nnow, first of all, 'cause you and I have been\ntalking for several hours, so this is what is a truly\na long form conversation, and it's the outcome of a very long time of my reporting, and also being judicious about closing the loop on that. Because I do think it's important for people to know that sources have revelations. - And like you said, the programs, both on the Soviet side\nand the American side, conflicting, I think is the\nterm we used previously, ethically, morally on all fronts. People have done some horrible things in the name of security. In your book, \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\", you write about the CIA and the so-called\nPresident's third option. It turns out, so first of all, first option being diplomacy, and second option being war. So when diplomacy is inadequate\nand war's a terrible idea we would go to the third option. And this third option\nis about covert action and it's about assassination. So how much of that does the CIA do? - That is open to debate. We know from the historical record that the CIA was heavily involved in assassination during the\nCold War, that's non-negotiable. Even the names of the programs that were assigned to\nperform assassinations are fascinating and now declassified, like Eisenhower's, for example, was the health alteration committee. - Well, at least to have a sense of humor to this dark topic. - Then the more modern\nnames are targeted killing. Executive action, targeted killing. I mean, drone striking is\nessentially assassination. And people jump up and down and say that's not true, well, I spent quite a long time interviewing the CIA's lead council, John\nRizzo, he died recently. But Rizzo was very forthcoming with me, of course, never sharing\nclassified information, but going up to the edge of\nwhat can legally be known. Rizzo was thrown under the bus by sort of the general public for, he was the fall guy for\nthe torture campaign, the CIA calls it enhanced interrogation. And so Rizzo had this long career, he began working under\nthe Carter administration, and was responsible for the torture memos, was responsible for legally making sure the president's ass was covered, and then got thrown under the bus. And so he was very forthcoming,\nnot in a bitter way, but in a very earnest way about a lot of how these programs\nare made to be legal, because if the president\nof the United States says they're legal, they're legal. Executive Order 12333, it says we don't assassinate, but it can be overwritten\nby another order, that's straight out of Rizzo's mouth. Also really important to keep in mind is that the military operates under what's called Title 50. It's part of the National\nSecurity Code that gives, like, sort of rules et cetera, how you must behave in a war theater. Well, the CIA is under no such rules, it operates under what's called Title 50. And it's interesting to me as a reporter, 'cause before I wrote the book and reported openly about Title 50, it was not really discussed, and now you even see operators\nthemselves on podcast talking about Title 50,\nwhich is kind of great, because it's like the\ncat's out of the bag guys, that's what it's called,\nand that's how it works, it means what we say goes. - Can you elaborate on what Title 50, so it basically says\nassassination is allowed? - It says what the president wants, the president gets. And so, I mean, the best example is the killing of Bin Laden. We were not at war with Pakistan,\nso Title 50 doesn't apply, you can't have a military\noperation in a country you're not at war with. I mean the lines, my God,\nnow they've really blurred, but even then they were\na little more honored. And so what do you do? Well, Leon Panetta was the CIA director, and you work out a scenario whereby the Seals, and by the way, there was a rotational on\nthat killer capture mission, which was really just a kill mission. Seals were practicing,\nDelta was practicing, and Special Activities\ndivision was practicing. They were all practicing\nat a secret facility in North Carolina. And it was just like, they're ready until they get the go order, and it just happened to be the Seals. So the Seals operate under Title 10. So they had to get, what\nI call sheep dipped, because that's what the insiders call it, and that is a term that\ncomes from, interestingly, Area 51, the U-2 pilots\nwere Air Force pilots, they needed to be sheep\ndipped over to the CIA, so they could do things\nthat defied the law. So you can see how these all entwined and you become more and more\ninformed and you go, aha. So that's how Title 50 worked. So the night of that mission,\nit was a CIA mission, because the CIA is allowed\nto go into Pakistan and kill someone, and the military can't. - That's fascinating, so people talk about the Navy Seals doing it, but it's really, legally speaking to get\nthe permission to do it within the whole legal framework of the United States, it was the CIA. - And if you look at their\nuniforms that they were wearing, and now that you know this, oh, you'll see, there's no\nnomenclature on them. So they're just meant to\nbe completely untraceable, were they to be shot down and captured, it's like, wait, who are these guys? Oh, a bunch of rogue guys. And this goes back, the\norigin story of all that is in Vietnam with MACV-SOG, and these cross border operations that I chronicle in\n\"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\", which still amaze me to this day. I mean, SOG missions, they\ncalled it suicide on the ground, 'cause that's what it was. And these guys had no identifiable, nothing, I mean, they were\nessentially in pajamas. Even their weapons were\nespecially designed by the CIA to have no\nserial numbers, no nothing. So if they were captured\nand they became POWs, I don't know who these guys are. - What do you think, and\nhow much do they think at the highest levels of power, about the ethics of assassination and about the role of that in geopolitics and military operations? Like to you maybe also, does assassination make sense as a good methodology of war? - I mean, again, I try to remain\nagnostic on the policy part of it and just report the\noperator's perspective. Because this is what people do, and this is what people are asked to do. And it depends on the individual, I mean, Billy Waugh went\non a lot of those missions, I mean the saying is like, oh, Billy Waugh, he killed\nmore people than cancer. Did Billy Waugh ever tell me\nabout direct assassinations? No, because they're all classified. Did he tell me about some failed ones? Yes, I'll give you an example,\nit's really interesting. He would show me these PowerPoints that were just fantastic,\nlate in his life, he was constantly being\nasked to go up to Fort Bragg and lecture to the young soldiers, and everybody loved him. And he would drive all night to get there and he would create these PowerPoints, and then he would show me the PowerPoints, all unclassified, but at one point, when Hugo Chavez was in power, Billy Waugh was kind of\nasked, that's how it works, like, if you had to think\nabout doing something, what would it look like,\nlet's just say hypothetically. So he took me through this\nPowerPoint that never happened, whereby he and a group of operators, agency operators were gonna HALO jump in to the palace and grab\nChavez and probably kill him, 'cause he wouldn't allow\nhimself to be captured. And by the way, HALO\njumping, for those listeners who don't know, high\naltitude, low opening. So you jump out of an aircraft, and you go down like a pencil\nuntil you're really low to the deck, like 1,000 feet,\nyou pull your parachute cord, and that way you're\nnot picked up on radar, and you're also not traceable\nwhen you get to the ground, 'cause it's so fast. Billy Waugh took the second HALO jump in history into a war theater in Laos during the Vietnam War. So he's like this famous HALO jumper. So he and the team were\ngonna go in, grab Chavez, and he said to me a very interesting thing that was kind of\na one moment in time where I saw a different side\nof Billy Waugh, where he said, \"I'm so glad we didn't do that, even though I really\nwanted to at the time.\" Because can you imagine that country's problems where it is now? Can you imagine how we\nwould have been blamed? And it was like, an interesting\nrare moment for Billy Waugh to comment on the bigger picture that you're asking me about. I think pretty much the operators I know, they just stick to the mission. - So in the technical\ndifficulty of those missions, just your big sense, how\nhard is it to assassinate, to assassinate a target on\nthe soil of that nation? - I suppose that just depends. All right, here's another insightful thing Billy Waugh said to me, and\nI'm answering the question around because I don't\nknow, because again, I never had anyone say to\nme, here's how it went down. Because you can't, that would be, first of all, those are classified, so I'm never gonna receive\nclassified information. I did hear a lot about\nreconnaissance missions when people would be in charge of, you have to be able to,\nwhat's called make book, on the target before. And making book on the target\nmeans photographing them, then that gets run up the chain of command to make sure this is really Imad Mughniyeh we're about to kill. But I once asked Billy, when I was trying to get the question and\nhe wouldn't answer it, and I said, so there's\nanother person in my book named Rick Proto, who's also\nlike a legendary agency guy, he's like 20 years younger than Billy. And I said, \"Billy, if you and Rick had to kill\neach other, like who would win?\" I was trying to imagine\nthis like hypothetical, like how would that work, who would win? And I posed the question to each of them. And of course, each of them said me. Then I went back to them and Billy said, \"Let me tell you how I would win.\" And he said, \"I'd cheat. I'd show up before the\ndual and I'd kill him.\" - I have a lot of friends\nwho were Navy Seals, it's such a guy conversation. - Well, you would be amazed\nat what the women do, let me just tell you that. Women are part of the\nspecial activities division, a big part of it. - Can you comment on that? - I can, women can get a hell\nof a lot closer to a target. And I mean that literally. - The special operations, do you mean, is this part of the CIA? - The special activities division, now it's called the\nSpecial Activity Center, but originally, that's the umbrella agency that has the different paramilitary\norganizations under it. So the most lethal one is ground branch. And that's what I reported on\nin \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\", and its origins go way back\nto the Guerrilla Warfare Corps that was started in\n1947 for the president. - So women are also a part of the alleged assassination? - Absolutely. - And you're saying they can, at times be more effective. I'm just gonna leave that pause there. The reason I ask of how\ndifficult the assassinations are, with Bin Laden, it took a long time. So I guess the reconnaissance,\nthe intelligence for finding the target,\nI imagine with Mossad, maybe the CIA now, the\nleadership of Hamas, or the military branch of Hamas is much wanted from a\nassassination perspective. So to me as an outside observer, it seems like it's more\ndifficult than you would imagine, but perhaps that's the\nintelligence aspect of it, not the actual assassination\nof locating the person. - Well, I think it's because\nmostly from what I understand, it's a really dirty game and\npeople are covering for people. And I'll give you the\nexample of Billy Waugh and Imad Mughniyeh, if I may. So Imad Mughniyeh was\nthe most wanted terrorist in the world before Bin Laden, Hezbollah's chief of operations. And he was wanted by every, Mossad, John down, but\nno one could find him, he was missing for 20 years, there wasn't even a photograph of him. And then he resurfaced, and of all places he\nresurfaced in Saudi Arabia. That's when I say it's a dirty game, Hezbollah, Iran, Hezbollah, Iran, enemies with Saudi Arabia. Why on earth was Imad\nMughniyeh in Saudi Arabia? Well, that's where he\nwas, there was a Navy Seal who was doing reconnaissance on him, this is according to Billy\nWaugh, and this is around 2005. So Billy's in his eighties at this point, late seventies, eighties. And he gets word that the Seal who has been tracking Mughniyeh\nto get photographs of him to give the photographs to Mossad and CIA so they can do a joint\noperation to kill him, which they did with a\ncar bomb in Damascus, that's the end of the\nstory, but how we got there was the CIA needed confirmation, you can't kill the wrong person. So the Seal panicked,\naccording to Billy Waugh, and was just like, I'm outta\nhere, this is too dangerous, and I do not wanna wind\nup in a Saudi prison. So who do you send in? Billy Waugh, he shows up, he's there for 24 hours, he knows where Mughniyeh\nlives from the Seal. He positions himself in\na cafe across the street, which is run by Sudanese men, and of course Waugh speaks some Sudanese because he operated in Sudan. And he's shooting the shit\nwith him, by his own words, he had the most foul mouth that was just absolutely\ndelightful to listen to. And then in between him and\nMughniyeh's house is a dumpster. And Billy Waugh being Billy Waugh, who will go to any lengths to do the job, decides to conduct reconnaissance from inside the dumpster. And that is where he is\nwhen he takes the picture of Imad Mughniyeh, living\nso comfortably in Saudi that Mughniyeh came, according to Billy, came out of his a apartment building with dry cleaner plastic bag\nhangers over his shoulder. That's how comfortable, he lived there. It was his neighborhood. Click, click, click, Billy\nWaugh takes the photographs, runs 'em to the CIA headquarters\nin Saudi at the embassy, oh my God, it's Mughniyeh,\nget the hell out of here, he gets to the airport, he leaves. Those photographs get sent to the agency, and then they do the\noperation with Mossad, and Mughniyeh is dead. Now the truth about that\nbeing a co CIA mission was not reported for many\nyears after the fact. Mossad took credit as the CIA often likes to just give other people credit. They just want the job done. - Well, speaking of Mossad,\nwhat in your understanding of all the intelligence agencies, what are the strengths and weaknesses of the different intelligence\nagencies out there? CIA, Mossad, MI6, SVR, and FSB, and Chinese Intelligence, all this kind of stuff. Is there some interesting differences, insights that you have from\nall your studying of CIA? - That's a really interesting question. I don't know, and here's why, it's because I've never interviewed any intelligence officer\nwith those other agencies. I've interviewed a couple people with Shin Bet in Israel. But until I speak to an actual source whose job it was, I don't know. And so the information that I'm getting is based on perception of others, which one would think\nwould be deeply clouded by the idea that America's the greatest. (Lex giggles) - [Lex] Right, right. - We're better than them. - Yes, well, actually\nthe fascinating thing is, 'cause you've spoken to a\nlot of people about the CIA, how do you know they're telling the truth? And this actually\nprobably applies generally to your interviews with\nvery secretive people. How do you get past the bullshit? - Well, that's just\nlike multiple sourcing. So you find the story\nout and then you have to, you go to the national archives,\nand you find the operation, and then you learn all about this, and then you interview\nother people who were there, and you put the story together\nto the best of your ability, and you make very specific\nchoices with quote, so and so said, end quote, said so and so. And very rarely do I\nreport on a single source, as I did in the end of Area 51, and then it says essentially, look, dear reader, this is\nwhat the source told me, I have no way of corroborating it, this is legit and here it is. So that's an area to make\nyour reader comfortable with the information\nthat they're being given. And then in all of my books, whether there are three or 400 pages, there's always 100 pages\nof notes at the end. So you can see all the sourcing, and you can begin to get an understanding of how journalism in the\nnational security world works. And also great opportunity for me to say, I'm often standing on the\nshoulders of journalists before me who did an incredible\njob digging into something and being able to report what they knew. Often the books are 10, 20, 30 years old, and so much more has come to light since. - And I also would just like\nto say that I appreciate that you said great\nquestion, I don't know. Not enough people say I don't know, and that's a sign of a great journalist. But speaking about things\nyou might not know about, (Lex giggling) let me ask you about\nsomething going on currently. So recently, Alexei Navalny died in prison, perhaps\nwas killed in prison. What's your sense from looking at it? Do you think he died of\nnatural causes in prison? Do you think it's possible\nhe was assassinated? Russia, Ukraine, Mossad, CIA, whoever has interest\nin this particular war? - For that, I look directly\nto the historical record. Having written about Russian\nassassination campaigns and programs since the\nearliest days of the Cold War. And Russia has a long history of assassinating, murdering dissidents. And in \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish\", I tell the story of an actual KGB assassin named Khokhlov, who knocked on the door of the man he was assigned to kill. And by the way, this all comes from a book that Khokhlov wrote later, because he defected to the United States, he knocks on the door, and\nthe guy answers the door, and instead of killing him,\nhe has like this moment of conscious of crisis,\nor crisis of conscience, and says like, \"I can't kill you, even though that's what\nI'm supposed to do.\" And then sits down with the guy and together decides,\nokay, we're gonna defect, we're gonna let the Western\nintelligence agencies know what we're doing here. And the CIA got involved, but Russian assassins were able to poison Khokhlov with polonium, what happens to him is insane and it's a miracle he\ndidn't die, but he doesn't, and then he defects to the West and he writes these books, and he tells lots of incredible secrets\nabout the Russian assassination programs and their poison labs, and they're really,\nreally, really interesting. And so to answer that question, I mean, to my eye, of course, I don't know, but it certainly looks\nlike Russia is acting in the same vein that it has always acted, taking care of dissidents\nthat go against Mother Russia. - So in the style of KGB assassinations. Is there something you can comment on about the ways that KGB\noperates versus the CIA when we look at the history\nof the two organizations, the Cold War, after World War II, and the leading up to today? - I mean, my feeling\non that is always that there's a thread somewhere in declassified documentation about these programs of America working to maintain a semblance of democratic ideals. However surprising that may be. In other words, always trying to, I don't wanna say fight fair, because killing people isn't fair, but versus a certain ruthlessness, a real sinister, totalitarian type ruthlessness, certainly from Soviet Russia. I'm far less familiar with modern day Russian assassination activities, although we certainly know on\nthe record that they exist. Some people have done\ngreat reporting on that. But there seems to be a kind of, almost a sadism about the Russian programs that I personally have not\nseen in the American programs. - What about on the surveillance side? It seems like America's pretty\ngood at mass surveillance, or at least has been revealed through NSA and all this kind of reporting, and leaks, and whistleblowers. Can you comment to the degree\nto how much surveillance is done by the US government,\ninternally and externally? - If you'd asked me five years ago, I would've a very different answer, first of all, they're looking\nfor a needle in the haystack, they're looking for the Bin Laden, and they can't find the\nneedle in the haystack, but they continue to create the haystack and survey the haystack. But the real problem, what has happened, and I write about this in\nmy book, \"First Platoon\", which is about a group of young soldiers who goes to Afghanistan and\nunwittingly becomes part of the Defense Department's biome efforts to capture biometrics on 85% of the population of Afghanistan. Which, by the way, China then emulated in their own biometric\nsurveillance program. And I think this is a terrible idea, but what has happened,\nthese biometric systems that have been created, and biometrics are of course fingerprints, facial images, DNA, and IRIS scans,\nthat allow you to tag, track, and locate people. And what has happened in the five years since this question was\nfirst on everybody's minds about NSA surveillance, is\nthat the civilian sector companies have essentially done all the Defense Department's biometric surveillance job for them. By all of us sharing our\nfacially recognizable images on Instagram, and Facebook,\nand everywhere else, X, by sharing information,\nby writing up narratives about ourselves, this\ninformation has become part of the database. Five years ago when I was\nreporting First Platoon, I was interviewing the\npolice chief of El Segundo, which is kind of like\non the outskirts of LA, it's right near the airport. And why it's important is 'cause it's like defense contractor haven. So they have like massive surveillance. And Chief Whalen, when I\nposed this question to him, he said to me, \"Annie, let\nme show you something.\" And he had Clearwater AI, the recognition software on his phone. And this was still when it was like, quasi not supposed to have to, you have that for law enforcement, and he said, \"I want\nyou to go down the block and I want you to just turn the corner and come back toward me.\" Which I did. And he just didn't even hold up his phone, it looked like his hand\nand his phone was on me. And he went back down, it was\nlike the tiniest movement. And when I came back to\nhim, he went like this and he showed me, there I\nwas, everything about me, everything about me, facts, and figures, and all images. And he knew who I was\nbefore I even got to him. So is that a good thing or a bad thing? I mean, we could have another three hour conversation about that alone. - So you're saying more and\nmore you don't need an NSA where we're giving over the data ourselves publicly or semi publicly? - Yeah, during the War on terror, people were just like incensed to learn that there's a drone that's flying at something like 20,000\nfeet, it's called ARGUS-IS. And it can capture, it's not a license plate, it's like, it can basically capture\nwhat's written on a golf ball from 17,000 feet, 20,000 feet up. And people went crazy over this, like, oh my God, it's Big Brother. Well, one of the lead engineers on that, Pat Bilgin, is someone\nI talk to regularly, because we talk about surveillance a lot, 'cause he thinks about it a\nlot 'cause he has kids now. And he has given so much thoughtful, really thinks about this issue, because he believes, just like you stated, that what we are turning\nover about ourselves actually exceeds anything\nthat ARGUS-IS could do from above because we're\ndoing it willfully. And so what it's doing is\nit's creating an ability, if someone wants to know about you, if someone, let's say in government, wants to know about Lex Fridman, they can find out everything about you. And then that gets used for tagging, tracking, and ultimately. In the war theater, it was\ncalled find, fix, finish, well, what do you think the\nfinish is in that statement? - It's not pleasant. - It's called a drone strike. Find, find them with the biometric, fix him, meaning fix his position, we know he's moving in a\ncar, that's him, that's him. Finish him, call it\nin, drone strike, boom. - If we could return to nuclear war, you've briefly mentioned\nthat a lot of things go back to the Third Reich and Hitler. If we go back to World War II, we look at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the dropping of the two bombs. I would love to get your opinion on whether we should or\nshouldn't have done that, and also to get your opinion on what would've happened if Hitler and Germany built the bomb first. Do you think it was possible he could have built the bomb first? - In my researching Third Reich weapons for \"Operation Paperclip\",\nbecause of course, we got a lot of those scientists after. - Which is another great book and a terrifyingly complicated operation. - Yes, at what point do the ends justify the means? But in looking at those programs, and we acquired Hitler's\nfavorite weapons designers, and I'm talking about\nweapons of mass destruction, like chemical weapons\nand biological weapons. But of course, America was\nahead in the nuclear program, and an interesting detail\nreading Albert Speer's memoirs, was Speer referring to\na conversation he had with Hitler where Hitler said, \"No, I don't wanna do that,\nthat's Jewish science.\" And so because of\nHitler's own racial ethnic prejudices, they didn't develop the bomb. As far as should we have\ndropped the bombs on Hiroshima, I've interviewed all kinds of people with different opinions, most of them that had ended the war. The best interview and\nmost meaningful perhaps that I ever did was with Al O'Donnell, who was a participant in\nthe Battle of Okinawa, which was like this insane, just to read stories about Okinawa, it makes your hair stand on end. And O'Donnell, like so many others, was slated to invade mainland Japan to his\nalmost certain death. So somebody like that, it makes sense right from the get go why he would be pro nuclear weapons. It saved his own personal life and it saved everyone that he knew that he was fighting with,\nand it ended the war. - Do you think it sent a signal, like without that we wouldn't have known perhaps about the power of the weapons? In the long arc of that\nhistory, 70 years plus, it is the reason why\ndeterrence has worked so far. - Yes, that's an interesting thought. My thought goes to this idea of more, that everybody always wants more. It's a very dangerous,\nit's like more power, literally, not just figure, more power. And what is more confounding to me beyond the fact that we\ndropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki\nand the war ended, is that this decision was then made to develop the thermonuclear bomb. The degree of magnitude of\nthat power is mind-boggling, I mean, even projects\nwithin the Manhattan Project defined thermonuclear weapon, the thermonuclear weapon\nas the evil thing, like it was evil, it's\na weapon of genocide. Atomic weapons destroy cities, thermonuclear weapons\ndestroy civilizations. - You open the book\nwith a Churchill quote, \"The story of the human race is war. Except for brief and\nprecarious interludes, there has never been peace in the world, and before history began, murderous strife was\nuniversal and unending.\" Do you think there will always be war? Do you think that there\nis some deep human way in which we're attending to this kind of global war eternally? - Well, the optimistic answer of that would be that we could evolve beyond that. Because certainly, if we\nlook at our ancestors, they had not developed their consciousness as far as we have, to be able to build the tools that we have. And so the hopeful answer is, we will evolve beyond\nthis kind of brute force, kill the other guy attitude. Certainly, these are questions that will become more obvious over time. I just want to play my little part in this world that I live\nin as the storyteller, who brings information to people so that they can have\nthese kind of questions with themselves, with their\nfriends, with their families. And I think in asking that very question, what you're really saying is, why don't we evolve beyond war fighting? - It is very possible. And your book is such a\nstark and powerful reminder that human civilization as we\nknow it ends in this century. It's a good motivator to\nget our shit together. - But aren't you really saying human civilization could end, not it ends? - Could end.\n- Could end. - But the power of our\nweapons is growing rapidly. - As they say, it's time to\ncome back from the brink. And it's time to have that discussion while we're still talking. - And there's another complexity sneaking up into the picture in the form of artificial intelligence\nand in cyber war, but also in hot war, the\nuse of autonomous weapons. All of it starts becoming\nsuper complicated as we delegate some of\nthese decisions about war, including nuclear war to\nmore and more autonomy and artificial intelligence systems. It's gonna be a very interesting century. Do you, just to zoom out a little bit, hope that we become a\nmulti-planetary species? - I'm all for adventure. (both giggling) - And I too, while am for adventure, I'm all for backups in all forms. So I hope that humans start a civilization on Mars and beyond out in space. And if you zoom out across all of it, what gives you hope\nabout human civilization, about this whole thing\nwe have going on here? - I mean, I am a fundamentally\noptimistic person, I must have come outta the shoot that way, because I just am. Even though I write\nabout really grim things, I get inspired by them, because I do always believe in evolution. I also have like the greatest family ever, two kids, Jet and Finley,\nshout out to them, they're Lex Fridman fans. And my husband. So what inspires me is\nlike this idea of legacy, I think that you always\nwanna have your eye on being a good example\nto the best that you can. And passing on what you know and believing kind of\nin the next generation. And again, that's a sentiment echoed by all these cold warriors\nI've been talking to, because they also share that, that idea that, wow,\nlook at what we have done as a civilization and\nlook where we're going, whether it's exoplanetary travel or AI, it's just that the human factor of like\nthe desire to fight, the desire to have conflict, needs to be reconfigured. Because with all these new\ntechnologies that we have, the peril is growing at\nan accelerating pace, perhaps faster than the\naverage human can keep up with. - Well, Annie, thank you for\nbeing a wonderful example of a great journalist, a great\nwriter, a great human being. And I'm a big fan of yours,\nit's a huge honor to meet you, to talk with you today, so thank you so much for talking today. - Thank you for having me. - Thank you for listening to this conversation with Annie Jacobsen.
