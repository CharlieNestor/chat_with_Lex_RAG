      "text": "Let's start with love. Your parents had a complicated love story, divorced twice, married three times. What have you learned about love from your mom and dad\nand their love story? - That it's messy. That it takes work. That it's ugly. That no matter how ugly or messy it is, don't go to bed until you've come back\ntogether to either embrace or admit that you truly love each other, even if you hadn't solved what the hell you're bitchin' about. Love will win in the end, literally, three to two, with my mom and dad. (Matthew and Lex laugh) - Yeah. - And that even in the two\ndivorces and in the two times where they couldn't live with each other, they still loved each other. They just couldn't live with\neach other at that time. For whatever reason they needed, and I don't know the details, if they needed their\nspace, freedom, or what, but they were never out\nof love with each other. And that as a parent, when we're not sure what to do, and people give you a\n1,000 books and advice, as a parent, if your\nkid knows you love 'em, you're in the black. That's the main thing. It won't work without that. And it can work and will\nusually can work with that. They just know that fact. - So it's not just love for each other, it's the love for the bigger family that ultimately helps you persist\nthrough the ups and downs. - Well, I mean, I don't know how much, particularly my mom and dad were staying together at times, maybe when they didn't want\nto because they had children. I don't actually think\nthey considered that. I think they were much less conscientious than say I am today. I think my mom and dad were\nmore like, they'll be fine. We love 'em. They'll be fine, but we'll cross that\nbridge when we get there. Right now, let's work\nit out between you and I is what I think my mom and dad were saying to each other, or not. They wanted and needed a relationship that was a tidal wave, rocky, right angles, tsunamis. And to this day, in my life with Camilla and I, which I don't, I like a\nriver has some swerves and some streams and some rapids, but I'm not looking for a tidal wave. My mom's like, what's with all this,\neverything's so smooth. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Stuff. Come on, come on, come on, come on. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So she challenges vitality, 'cause that's what my mom\nneeded to communicate. I don't think my dad needed it as much of that the hard angles\nthat their relationship to, I don't think my dad needed\nit as much as my mom. - But the clashes demonstrated the passion that underlies the love. - Yes, and I've always been asked, when I talk about my\nparents' love relationship, I tell the stories that\nare actually sometimes quite violent, and- - [Lex] There's some good stories there. - They're beautiful, I\nthink they're beautiful. - Yeah, I think they're beautiful too. - But I've had people go, what? Wait a minute, that was unhealthy. You can't, and I was like, no. That's, again, back to the beginning, love is messy. And what I love about those stories is that's where the love was actually. It was tested, and it could have broke and been over. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And it never was. Again, the love won in the kitchen floor, blood's drawn, knives are pulled. - [Lex] Ketchup. - Ketchup's all over. - [Lex] Yeah. - But we make love on the kitchen floor and, I mean-\n- Yeah. - Come on, beautiful. - So as romantic as it gets right there. - [Matthew] Whoa!\n(Lex laughs)"

      "section": "Dreams",
      "text": "- What's the memory from\nchildhood that helped set you on the trajectory of becoming\nthe man you are today? - Standing on the corner with Mr. Mayor, the principal of St. Phillips School, I was in kindergarten, eh, looked up and there was a cloud in the sky. And I said, Mr. Mayor, is that\ncloud as big as the world? And he paused for a minute and he goes, \"Well, yes, it is, Matthew.\" Now, in my seven-year-old mind, I went, okay, I can see the outlines of it. And that must mean it is so far away. Because if that's as big as the world, I remember it took 15 hours\njust to drive from Longview to Florida last year, you know? And I can't even see that far. So that cloud must be so far off that it's not worth me even considering space, dreams, any of that. I was like, (whistling)\narmy, I'm looking down. I'm gonna put my head to the ground. I'm gonna look right in front of me and deal with what's in front of me. Because dealing with\ndreams and what's out there and not on this Earth\nthat gravity holds down, not worth considering. You'd never make it. It's not even worth imagining. It's, pfft, fairy dust. So I think I learned a lot\nof self-reliance from that. I think I got a work ethic from that. I think I got a, hey, focus on\nwhat's right in front of you. Do the deed, take care\nof what's in front of you one at a time and slowly\nnotch up your way. And, hopefully, there's\nsome ascension to that. And it wasn't until quite years later, in some ways, decades\nlater, that I started to go, \"Oh, I can project, I can dream.\" Why? Because literally the\nfirst time I got on a plane and then 30 seconds I was in a cloud, I'm like, Whoa, we must be\ngoing a trillion miles an hour. Cause we're already in that cloud that was as big as the world\nthat I saw the edge of. And then I grew and learned enough to go, Well, that's not true. Planes don't go that fast. Oh, what Mr. Mayor said\nwasn't really true. That cloud is not as big as the world. And it's not near as\nfar away as I thought. But I'm glad he lied to me. (chuckles) - What do you think about that\ntension of a way of living life between being a\ndreamer and a pragmatist? - [Matthew] Yeah. - Which is the better way? - Dude, the honey holds the\nreciprocity of the two of 'em. I mean, I can't be present\nunless I got a plan. I wanna have the big picture in mind, but I gotta go a day at a time. I like to write the headline or I think we need to have a North Star, something to look forward to. But we all know that\nif we're staring at it, we're tripping on the way. You read the Hallmark cards, which irk me, dream it, you can do it. I think that's a half-ass\nhorrible thing to tell somebody. (Lex chuckles)\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And then on the other side, you have things like, people say hope means nothing. Well, yes, it does. That's the dream. You just don't stop there. It's not a period after that word. Now, what do we do practically? And I think that constant tension, when that tension's a dance\nis when it's beautiful, But to see those as contradictions, I think is where it's falling short. One on their own, if we silo the two, well, if you silo the two, I guess the pragmatic's\nthe one to go with, because at least you'll\nget something done. But if you only silo the dream and don't do anything about it, you're kind of living an illusion and kind of living in a virtual reality. - Yeah, it's tricky. Even the people you love can\nsometimes suffocate the dream, can make you believe\nthat it's not possible. It feels like a lot of parents\nkinda want you to be safe, want you to be stable, want you to have a plan so that\neverything's gonna be okay. - [Matthew] Yeah. - And the dream feels\nlike a threat to that. - Yeah. How much of that, though, I\nwonder is proper initiation? Because if you throwing dreams\nout, I call it conservative, very liberal light. Let's learn to block and tackle. Let's learn that work ethic, those things, those pragmatics first, learn the rules of the road, the rules of the game, the things that we can\nall kind of rely on. This is how the world's supposed to work. Now, it doesn't always work that way. You know, you teach a child to drive, it's like, \"Hey, you stay in the lane, you go to speed limit. This is all helpful.\" But that doesn't\nguarantee that no one else is running the red light. But you learn that later. There's an initiation, I think that's proper with the dream. I mean, I think parents, my parents are very much that way. The idea of going to chase an acting career or something was, what? That was a different vernacular. That was like, not in our, I was taught to work our\nway up a company ladder, and, nine to five, do your job. But the day I brought it up and said I wanted to go to film school, and I thought my dad was gonna go, \"You wanna do what, boy?\" He was like, gave me some\nof the best advice ever and told me not to half-ass it. He said, \"Go!\" In between the lines, what he heard from me was that made him so happy\nas a father, I believe, and makes any parent happy, is when our child\ndoesn't ask us permission to go chase a dream. - [Lex] Oh, yeah. - When they're going, I'm bringing it up to\nyou with full respect. - [Lex] Yeah. - But I'm doing this with or without you. That's when a parent goes, \"Ah, yes, I've done something right enough. I helped my child be secure enough in the pragmatics to\nhave a foundation enough where they have the\ncourage to go, (whistling) I'm flying the nest.\" - To take the leap. You wrote, \"After my\ndad died, I had a dream that left me with a statement. Less impressed, more involved.\" - [Matthew] Yeah. - What do those words mean to you? - We gotta be more than\njust happy to be here. I'm big on gratitude, but we gotta be more than\njust thankful to be here. Or dream that you can do it. It's gotta be more than\njust dream you can do it. That's impressed. The dream is still other than and if I'm here, and so impressed with\ntalking to you today, if I have a reverence to an extent, I will not be able to be\ninvolved in this conversation. I'll be too impressed. I'll be anticipating, oh, what's that question he's gonna ask, oh, I think I know he's going with this, oh, I think I know what\nanswer he might love to hear, oh, I'm not involved in conversation. I'm too impressed. So I'm removed from the present. For me, what that literally meant to me, when that came to me in a\ndream and I carved it in, I remember carved it in a tree. It took a couple hours. I still know where that tree is, Santa Monica. My father had moved on,\nhe'd left this life. All of a sudden, it hit me, oh, I don't have the safety net. My dad was above law and above\nreligion to me, he had me. If I really was in the shit,\nif I really needed him, I trusted that he had my back\nabove law, above anything. All of a sudden he's gone. I'm going, okay. It hit me how much I'd been\npretending to be the young man I was trying to be, and not actually putting\nmy ass on the line and have enough courage to take risk and actually own up to the man that he was teaching me to be. And I remember the world got flat. That cloud, that Mr.\nMayor that I saw up there was not way up there. It was, it was fog in front of me now, and let's go into it. I'd say I probably\ngained even more respect for people and things, but I lost a certain amount of reverence that was keeping me from\nfeeling like I'd deserved or I'd earned things or\nlooking out for myself or holding myself to task. And I remember all the things, and I was just going into\nHollywood at the time, so fame was out there\nas one of those clouds, with being an actor and\nall of a sudden celebrity and becoming famous. The reverence I had, I remember it just (whistling) it lowered down to eye level. And I was able to realize it and go, that's not fairy dust. And don't give it so much\ncredit to make it fairy dust. Like, oh, not me. No, I could never, no,\nlook that in the eye with full respect, but less reverence. And at the same time, equidistant, almost equal sublimation. I noticed where I had been\ncondescending people and things, and patronizing and\nput things off as like, less than me and not worthy of my time. (whistling) It raised up to eye level. And so they were all flat in front of me, and the world was flat and I was able to, shoulders went back, my heart\nrose up, my chin lifted up. I looked things in the eye. I became probably less sentimental, hopefully, not to level\nthat I got callous, but I know I became less sentimental. I became more courageous because, when you have someone pass in your life, or maybe it's similar to a situation you're going on in your own\nlife with your homeland, you sober up on these mendacities that we deal with every day, and this bullshit that\nwe give too much credit or too much significance to. And you're like, what am I doing? I'm not even gonna let myself emotionally get brought down or over\nelated by this situation, 'cause it doesn't really\nmatter in the big scheme. And so with certain things\nthat I found reverence for and hesitated from in my life, I was now engaging with, because I was like, oh, it's live. This life is live. Let's look it in the eye\nand go forward through it and deal with the consequences."

      "text": "- What do you make of death? Does it scare you? - I'm not looking forward to\nit, but it does not scare me. - Do you think about it? Do you visualize it? - I do. I do. And it's a beautiful visualization and a beautiful dream when I\ngo as part of the food chain. It's not a good visualization when I go as part of a\nrandom act of violence in a fricking drive-by or something. Because the second, the accident, it breaks a story that I believe\nhas already been written. At least I don't have the capacity yet to put it into a story, a divine story of the lives that we live. And so there's something\nugly and gross about it. And it happens all the time,\nto people all the time. I just feel like when it's\npart of the food chain, when I go as part of the food chain, I'm like, ah, that's poetry. - [Lex] Part of the flow of nature. You return to nature. - Yeah, there's grace and poetry in that. - Do you miss your father? Think about him? - When I think about him, I do. Now, when do I think about him? I thought about him yesterday\nworking through a script I'm working on right now,\nworking on scene work. And I just had that quick little reaction of wanting to show him,\nhey, check the scene. That's right and then I, I don't get sad. I go, \"Yeah, he would've loved this.\" Whereas my mom wants to be on the stage, my dad would've been on the front row. (Matthew and Lex laughing) - He's more fun to show stuff too. - Yeah. He was a character. He knew characters. I've based parts of all kinds\nof characters I've played and the man that I am on\npeople that he introduced me to and who he was. He would've loved the\ncreative process of working on a script or talking about, hey, movie. It's why I always say\nI love the movie \"Mud\" because it's the one that I've visualized and seen my dad come to me so\nmany times as a 12-year-old and put his arm around me and go, \"Hey, little buddy, you see\nthis movie called 'Mud'? Goddamn it, it's a good one. Let's go watch it.\" That, now my dad never got to\nsee me start a career in film, but he was alive five days, he overlapped the first five days of me\nworking on my first film, \"Dazed and Confused\". Now, that I think is, there's something beautiful about that. He didn't never ever come to the set. We didn't talk about it, but he was alive for me to start something\nthat was more than a fad. That was something that would become something that I love to do. And I do miss, not in, you know, and then I go outta that, we talked about him two nights ago with our daughter, I was\nrubbing my daughter's feet. And my mom, who's living\nwith us, she's 91, comes in and goes, \"Oh, look\nat you just like your pop.\" He's like, \"What?\" And he goes, \"Oh.\" 'Cause my dad loved her. Rubbed somebody's feet,\nrubbed my mom's feet, rubbed all of me and my\nbrother's girlfriend's feet. (Lex laughs) When we would have a date. - [Lex] Yeah. - They would come over early because they knew they\nwere gonna get a foot rub. - [Lex] I love it.\n- From Jim McConaughey. And then we'd come out, me\nand my two older brothers, this has been on for decades, we'd come out the shower, ready to go, buttoned up. And they looked like, \"We ain't\ngoing anywhere right now.\" (Lex laughs) And so we told the story to my daughter. And I was like, oh yeah, my dad's his hands, I miss his hands, his hands could heal. - So you carry him in you. - I hope so. I hope so. It's a challenge for me. And I suppose it's like this for any son. How much do we hang on to? And how much do we let go and evolve and update the os and try it maybe better or different? It's that, there's\ncertain things that I know that I fully believe in. It's like, when do we, religious, when do we cast away our father? When do we say no, I'm\ngoing after the dream. I'm not asking your permission. I question that from time to\ntime for myself because I, and it almost feels\nblasphemic, if that's a word, sometimes I feel like what are you doing? You can't check that and go like, well no, I'm not sure if I wanna really. And then I immediately\nkinda let myself off because I believe where he is. He's going, \"Go, buddy.\" - [Lex] Yeah. (laughs) - Go, you're free, man.\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - I'm not gonna hold you back. If you misread that or\nI didn't teach you that as well as maybe I wish I could have. Go, you're free. You're not gonna lose. Trust that you're not gonna lose. It's in your DNA. It's in your lineage, young man. - Still, it's scary to\nnot have a safety net. Losing your father is scary in that way. That you realize this world is just you, in some deep fundamental\nway, it's just you. - [Matthew] Yeah. - You're alone. - Yes. But, oh, I mean also not having that, it's such a gift of\ndeliverance though as well, because I think it's an, I mean, it's an awesome feeling to know, to know we're alone, to\nknow we don't have that, to know you don't have\ntake two or take three, that it's one take. I mean, the peripheral\nvision improves, (chuckles) the link and understanding\nwith our past improves. 'Cause I know for me, I was not ever considerate\nof my past at all, 'cause my dad had that if I needed it. He was my wealth for that. Well, he's gone, like I said, he had the literally\nhad, they have our back. Well, and then when they\nlong or have our back, all of a sudden I'm going like, oh, well, maybe I need to look back and start giving some\ncredit to how I got here, what I'm doing and where I'm heading. It gave me the first time courage to even look over my shoulder. 'Cause again, I didn't have to, 'cause I don't have to look. Dad's got my back. No, dad's gone from this life. He doesn't have your back. Okay. So I mean, I don't know, me, because it's inevitable. I very quickly go to, all right, in the pain, the loss, and yes, even loneliness, which is different from\nbeing alone and loss. Pretty immediately part and\nparcel with the pain, I felt it. - In the pain, you saw the gift, the red light of losing your father. - Pretty immediately, less\nimpressed, more involved. That came like couple weeks after moving on. - Is there a trick to that? To see the gift and the pain? - That's a good question. Is there a trick to it? Not that I know of. I mean, I don't, I have to catch myself from trying to intellectualize\nmy way into the reasoning and not skip over real\nfeelings and discomfort. I mean, I did get that from my mom and I have to watch it that, that so resilient, that we just dust herself\noff and get up and go. - You wanna sit in the feeling. You wanna feel it. You're willing to deeply feel the pain. - I wanna deeply feel it. I wanna look at the\neye and deeply feel it, but I don't wanna wallow in it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Now I was raised where\nyou skip the deeply feel and let's go. And I've said it before,\nbut that will lead to having turned into a person who is a repeat offender\n(chuckles) of the same crimes, 'cause you just get up and you don't, you don't have a winter in your life. You know what I mean? You don't have, there's\nno introspective time. You don't look over your\nshoulder into the past. And so you just get up and you're like, all right, I've stepped in\nthe same pile of whatever a hundred times and I'm fine. I'll do it a hundred first doesn't hurt. Hell, it's good luck. Well, hang on a minute. Maybe we wanna stop and go. What can I learn from that? But I don't know of a trick. I think if there's any trick, I would say, it's just, how quickly can\nwe admit the inevitable? I just wanna talk about in the book back, once you know it's inevitable,\nhow do we get relative? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Not skip it, not throw it to the side, not deny it, which I'd love to talk about that. Here's sometimes too, but the value of denial sometimes- - [Lex] The value of denial.\n- Yeah. But how quickly do we, once something's inevitable, go, (claps) okay, any mind and hard time\nI'm spending about going, no, I can't believe that happened. No, did that really happen? Anytime we spend trying to deny that, what has already happened,\nthat seems to me to be, I'm not sure the value of that time. So if there's any trick, I would say once you know\nsomething's inevitable, even though how painful it\nis or how awesome it is, start getting relative with that. And in the relativity is seeing there's a gift here. And if I realize that gift I'm honoring, now I'm onto building up the beautiful passage of my\nfather leaving this life. Now I'm on the march to go. Yes, let the legacy. Let this become omnipresent. Let him live through me. Let me become more hem. - It's transformed.\n- [Matthew] Yeah."

      "text": "- So what value is there then to denial? Any? - Oh, I think there's value to denial if you really commit to it. (laughs) I get this from my mother. - [Lex] Yeah. (laughs)\n(Matthew laughs) So it's a very pragmatic value. - [Matthew] Whoa!\n- Commit to the denial. - Okay. (Lex laughs) And my mom.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Does it to an extent that I'm like, \"Mom, do you have any consideration (Lex laughs) or context of situations?\" And she does. This is the thing, every time I go, she's not a shallow woman. But if it is something, if it is something happens\nin her life that is keeping her from going\nwhere she wants to go or a joy in her life that she does, she'll straight ass deny\nit happened, didn't happen. No, didn't. Mom, (chuckles) we're right here. I heard you.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - What you said. No, I didn't, you heard something else. Mom? Now does she get some amnesty on that? She's 91. Hell yeah, she gets some amnesty on that, Yeah, does she repeat offend? Yeah, but it's misdemeanors. You know what I mean? I mean, it's like we all, it's part of that thing when\nyou got a family member, you're like, yeah,\nthat's just what they do, just go with it. And it's ingenious in a way. It's a tool, she does. I think it is more of a trick with her. But she wouldn't even so\ningrained her, it's not a trick, it's just (whistles) do it, done. Another reason I bring this up, it's outside of just my mother is, I did this Roadtrip course in this\nArt of Living event a few weeks ago. Out of hundreds of thousands\nof chats that came in and responses that came in afterwards. It seemed to me that about\n80% of people's challenges and problems, even in their life, were something in the past\nthat they were hung up on, that they could not seem to get past. And it was holding them from going where they wanted to in their future. And so I thought that was revealing. I would've thought that was,\nI don't know going in 40%. It was 80, it seemed to be 80%. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then I thought about, okay, if you're here in the live show and you wanna get the course, you're into some sort\nof therapy or education or development or self-help\nor whatever, okay. And I have a lot of friends, and I know a lot of\npeople that are in weekly and daily therapy. And then I know there's a lot of people that are on prescriptions, drugs. And while a therapy and\nthe right prescription to the right person for the\nright diagnosis is necessary. I'm questioning, is there value to going, if you're not getting past this today, this week, this month, this year, all of a sudden a decade goes\nby, and you're still hung up and you can't get rid of that thing. And your memory where we, and it's got you paralyzed and you're a victim of it, and you're doing the therapy, and you're doing the work and you're taking a prescription if that's what you're taking, where does there, is there a value in going? If it's holding you back from\ngoing where you wanna go, maybe you should just deny the fucking thing ever fuckin' happened. - [Lex] Yeah. - Kick it in the head.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Kick it off the curb. I'm done with you. I'm sick of you, I'm tired\nof hanging out with you. I'm tired of that thing, whatever it is, hold me back from going where I wanna go. So if I can't wax the car, you know, and get past this thing, just kick it. - That's so powerful. So one thing to do like with\nthe loss of your father, is to try to transform it,\nto discover the gift in it. The gift and the pain. But if you can't keep\nlooking, keep looking, you can't find the gift and the pain, just deny it ever happened. - You could call that a trick. But I think it's more than a\ntrick because let me say this, my mom, after my father died, went on and found a\nsecond love of her life for 19 years, they were together. CJ Carlick. Love you, buddy. He's moved on now. Did she check with us a little bit? Like is this okay? She gave us a little\nlingering half a second look that we knew that maybe\nwas what she was asking, and we came to her was\nlike, yes, it's okay. And you know who else is saying it's okay, who's dancing up there for you? Dad. So was that her denying that the man she was divorced from twice, and married two, three times, and had three children with, had moved on? No, but she didn't say, I'm not, well, what's the book on how\nlong I'm supposed to say single before I can be interested in another? There's not a book on these things. How do you feel? Is loving CJ mean you love dad less? No. Is finding a new life and a\nnew dance partner in this life, in CJ mean that Dad\nwasn't your dance partner, that dad wasn't the love of your life? No. So I don't know, I mean, in there maybe, maybe there's another\nword, I think it's denial, but it's not really denial 'cause it's not like it didn't happen. That's an earlier example\nI was giving my mom. She will absolutely go, that light's not on. Mom, the light's on. We just, that light's not\non, if I say it's not on, sometimes you're just\nlike, that makes no sense. You're just absolutely\ndenying what just happened. We even have it recorded. - [Lex] Yeah. - And she'll go, well,\nthe recording is lying. - [Lex] Yeah. - I mean, that's part of\na coping deal with her. But I mean, one of\nthings is more important or more valuable is to talk about this. She didn't deny my dad dying. I didn't, but she sure as hell turn the page, and said, I can still\nstart a whole new category, a new life, a new love. Let my heart love and be\nloved by someone living in this life today that\nI'm still living in. And that will not trespass\non my love for my husband, your father, Jim McConaughey. And I think, I mean we were just, thought that was beautiful. Yes, Mom, go, talk about greenlight. Go! Now for a hung up going, can't have one or the can't have 'em both, gotta have one or the other. Now we start to make a contradiction\nof the two ideas again, which darn our contradictions get us in trouble all the time, man. - That's life though. The contradictions, right? - But isn't life, if we just admit the\ncontradictions are so much, don't they become a paradox? We admit that that's part of it. - [Lex] Yeah. - If contradictions are inevitable, hence they do become\na paradox, don't they? Then we're in the honey hall, (Lex chuckles) then we're singing and dancing, and have leniency with ourself while still holding ourself to task. And I think it's holding on\nto know each contradiction. Oh, here it is again. So it's a one-off. It lives on its own. Separate from the last one. No, it doesn't. (chuckles) They're connected, that's\nwhy they are a paradox. And then that's I think that's a much, I think that's where life really is. - In the paradox.\n- [Matthew] Yes. - In the dance of it. I think the metaphor of\nred, yellow, greenlights is just so simple and so powerful. You write about some\n\"Greenlights\" being engineered and some being mystical, which I love the difference of that. What's the difference of\nthe engineered \"Greenlights\" and the mystical? Such a cool word, mystical. - Yeah. Well, the engineered ones have reason and the mystical ones have rhyme. (laughs) - [Lex] Yeah. - Life's a mystery going forward, but it's a science looking back. I prepared, I've had ideas, and written headlines and had goals and athlete gets in shape for an event, and I get in shape for a role. I read, I study, I work, I prepare, and I go and I'm prepared\nand I behave and I do it. And I look at it and I go, yes, that's what I wanted to do. It's engineered, greenlight. It's a conscious delayed gratification. It's that if I do it today, that pragmatic head down, believe there's no cloud out there, but then I trust that\nthere is one out there. If I keep my head down to do it, I'll get that to that dream. We can engineer those habit, work ethic, prep, expertise, education. Now the mystical ones though, don't make any sense. They're not supposed to make sense. They only make sense after, right when they happen, you backlog and you connect the dots with how they got there. That red light you ran into that made you 30 seconds later to get to the restaurant, as you walked in, she walked out, and you went, \"Good morning.\" And she went, \"Good morning.\" (Lex laughs) And-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Two months later, you're dating, two years later, you're married, after that you've got a family. And now you're sitting\nhere 40 years later going, I love you. Look at what we've built. And you go back and go. (Lex laughs) What if I wouldn't hit that red light. - Those 30 seconds.\n- [Matthew] You know. - Made all the difference. - [Matthew] And- - So strange that this life is this way. - Yeah, and that's just rhyme. I mean, we can't really add that up. - Yeah. - It's a science when you look back, you see, you know why it was that you were upset and ticked off that you had to pick up the\nkids' toys before you left, and they were supposed to pick 'em up and therefore, you were late for the thing that maybe you ran into, and you ran into the person\nthat was walking in the office. That's the guy that you did the interview. That's the guy you were looking\nfor, the job you wanted. And you caught him 'cause you\nwere in the elevator with him. And that 90 seconds on\nthat elevator, (claps) that's what got you that job that led to you doing what you wanna do. I mean, the significance is there, but we have to, I think\nwhat we also gotta watch is, again, in that balance, what do we chase? Because we just chased the engineering. We miss magic. If we just chased the mystical, we find ourself caught up\nin trying to give meaning to that Lego set that was on the floor that my kids didn't pick up. And what color was it? And why did I walk out that that door and see almost step on the Legos. But if I'd gone out the other door, I usually go out of,\nI would've gone there. I would've got there early and wouldn't have run into the boss. So you can start to give too\nmuch meaning on that as well. I think we can give\nsignificance in too many places. And all of a sudden, I think we've all been there where you're seeing art\nin every single thing. Oh man, that can be paralyzing. It's like, it's hard to\nleave a room (chuckles) if everything's significant, or if everything's a sign. - How much of success in life\ndo you think is engineered and how much is mystical? And how much does it different\nfrom person to person? Because I, for me\npersonally, maybe I enjoy it, maybe I'm genetically built that way, but I exist more in the mystical, so I don't make plans. I traveled last summer\nin Ukraine with no plan. I just went there. No plan. I didn't know how I'm going to meet the president of the country. I didn't know anybody. And so there's no plan,\nthere's no clear thing. You're just roaming around. And that that's how I've existed in life. There's something about giving yourself over to the flow of\nnature that I just enjoy. It makes life so much fun. - It's awesome when you can do it. Did you engineer though, I'm going to put myself in the place when you got on the plane\nto go to the destination, that was an engineered choice? - Yes, I mean the choice. - With the in intent of, and maybe I'll meet and I'll run into, and I can work up a sit down with, so the engineered choice\nwas putting your shoes on, proverbially get, I always\nsay this the hardest part about going to the gyms,\nputting your shoes on, right? So to getting on the plane, that was an engineered\nthought with the goal in mind, but I don't know how I'm gonna do it. - The choice.\n- [Matthew] Yeah. - Putting the shoes on, yeah. But there's not a clear, it's a fog what happens\nafter the shoe is gone? - Yeah, (chuckles) - [Matthew] yeah, yeah,\nyeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's gonna take that leap. So I wonder how much for people who are\nsuccessful in this world and finding what makes them\ntruly happy and fulfilled, how much of it is engineer? How much is mystical? How much was it for you? - Well, I'll say this\nlike when I went to write about \"Greenlights,\" which is basically the\nlast 40 years of my life, I thought that 85, 90% of my successes were going to be obviously engineered. Or I could see the\nscience, saw the habits, here's what I did. yep, that add up, got the\nsolution, got the conclusion. I was very surprised when I noticed it was probably less than 50%. And that most of the real success of life were when I trusted, when I trusted that I\ndidn't have to define it. That I only trusted,\nthat I didn't have to go, well what's the measurement? What's the score? What lead this leads to what? What's next? For me, that's still a challenge for me daily now is to trust and not be, because I can be, I think I can be overly practical and I think I can over overcompensate and miss out on magic because I'm still going, wait, but do you, are we giving enough the\nmeasure and credit to actuality? Am I giving enough credit to\nthese are the steps to take? And this is reality. I think I'm reminded when I trust, 'cause that\ngoing with the mystic, just to put yourself on\nthe plane was the engineer. But getting there, and as you say you roll in that mystical, that takes a lot of trust. - Yeah. (chuckles) Trust in the inevitable. - [Matthew] Amen on that. - But not knowing where\nit actually ends you up. It's a feeling more than, I don't think it's a clear vision. - [Matthew] Right. - It's kind of like a feeling\nthat guides you towards, towards a place without a clear name, without clear characteristics. It just kind of pulls you there. - Where do you get that courage and trust to go with\nyour gut, your feeling? And is there, for instance, three days later you sit down. It doesn't happen, is there a\nsense a week, two weeks later, now and you come back\nto America that like, \"Ah, I've failed.\" - Sort of looking back to try\nto analyze what went right, what went wrong, that kind of thing. Yeah, that that engine is always there. But I think what pulls me forward in life, what makes me really grateful and fulfilled is noticing\nthe thing you mentioned, noticing the magic and\nkind of going towards it, sort of just sitting back both in tragedy and then triumph. So in war, there's a lot of tragedy, but there's somehow, one of the things you see in war, and this is the first war I've experienced and seen the front is the loss, that people lose their homes, and all this kind of stuff. The thing that rises from that\nis the love for each other. So the people I've spoken with, don't give a about the home. Don't give a about on farms,\non the animals they lost. Don't give a damn about having to move and all this kind of stuff. As long as the family's still there, as long as the people\nthey love are still there. And it's like, there's a melancholy smile\nthey have on their face. Like, yeah, this world\nis full of bullshit, it's full of tragedy, but life is fucking awesome. And you just notice that in little ways everywhere. You just sit back, and\nyeah, notice the magic. And I want more of that and\njust kind of follow along. - [Matthew] Yeah.\n- Like a little ant. - [Matthew] Yeah. - Keep noticing that kind\nof thing, but I don't know. I hope you know what I think it is, is other people notice that\nyou're the kind of person that notices it and they're like, I wanna hang out with that person. He seems all right. Like he seems one of the good ones, one of the good hands. (laughs) - Do you have any certain non-negotiable structure before that freedom to\ngo with the feeling? - I think so. There's such set of principles of just basically integrity\nof being good to other people. Like whatever that means for me, there's specific things\nlike I'm really into loyalty above the law.\n- [Matthew] Right. - There's a kinda like, there's a circle of friends I have and that means everything. There's just a basics deep\nkindness to towards others. Empathy, empathy towards\npeople that other, that others might label as even evil. I have that kind of empathy. I believe all of us have the\ncapacity to do good in evil. And so I just kind of see\neverybody as little babies that grew up in different conditions. And so some do evil, some do good. And there's, yeah, there's\nall kinds of other principles. I love the dynamic between the different humans in their full diversity. I love the dynamic between the masculine and the feminine and\nenjoy it, the dance of it. - Yeah, yeah. So you have a constitution with- (Lex laughs) - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Which you embark. - [Lex] You do too. - Into chasing.\n(Lex laughs) Yes, I hope so. And yeah, for me, I'd like to, it's inspiring to hear\nsomeone like yourself go, I go and I just land and\nI'm just gonna feel it. I can go back and go, yeah. My greatest truths I've crossed, my greatest successes in my life are win. I trusted that and go,\nI took a one way ticket. - [Lex] Amazon, Africa.\n- Africa. Yeah, and those were spiritual and very pragmatic because\nthey led to dealing with succeeding in other ways\nthat are more pragmatic 100%, and gave much more meaning to those things. But that's to be able to go out, and say that's how you, do you have family? - I really wanna get\nmarried and have kids, but I'm not married and\ndon't have kids yet. - [Matthew] Okay. - So actually one of the\nnice things about that is you can take bigger risks. - [Matthew] Yes. - So while I'm not married\nand don't have kids, I feel I owe it to myself to take, just to go, go to the Amazon. - Yes.\n(Lex laughs) Go to that backpack on\nand a one way ticket. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - That does get harder to do. I miss that, sometimes the whim, a song that comes on, you know. - [Lex] Yeah. - Where's that guy from?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Oh, they're from the\nplace that I wanna go, that I dream off, I'll go there. (whistles) One way ticket,\nwhat do I gotta do? Oh, get a couple shot. Okay, go. That was fun. (Lex laughs)\nGotta do this. - Let's get up and go, you're free to. - Yeah. And go, when are you back? When I get there?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It's a beautiful,\nbeautiful thing. (laughs) - [Lex] Maybe never.\n- Yeah, yeah. - [Lex] You don't know.\n- Yeah. Gosh, you'll be coming\nto visit me (chuckles) in this new place, maybe, yeah."

      "text": "- How did the Amazon, how did\nthe trip there change you? What do you remember of it? Such a magical place. - I've stripped a lot of my past symbols and talismans while I was there. I remember getting there, and just having so much\nadrenaline on the anticipation, anticipation of getting to the Amazon. In the first 10 days, I wasn't really enjoying the trip. I was just charging to\nget to the destination to get to the banks of the\nriver that I had a dream about. And then it just humbled me. I got so fatigued on night, whatever, 12, and was so sick and tired\nof the internal dialogue I was having with myself. I was not enjoying my company (Lex laughs) that I purged and I remember, and stripped off identity markers that I had sort of been hanging onto for like, everything from, what it means to be an American. My dad's ring, him from McConaughey, a meltdown of my mom and dad's class rings from University of Kentucky,\nwere gold from her teeth, and his class ring melted down. Taking that off was really hard to go, I'm casting, am I casting out my father? And I wasn't casting him out, I was just removing to say, I don't have to rely on that\nbeing all of my identity. So to pull that off, to strip down and just to\nwhere I was just a mammal. That next morning, I was light. I got present. I remember writing something down. It was like, all that I\nwant is what I can see and what I can see is in front of me. That sense of not, I\nwasn't leaning around, looking around every corner to get there. And as soon as that hit me, talking about mystical successes\nand realities and truths, as soon as that hit me and\nfor the first time in 12 days, I didn't care about getting there or what was around the corner. Guess what was around\nthe next game corner? The Amazon (chuckles) I mean\nnot around a few corners. The next corner there it was. And that was just like a touche. Those times when the\nprime mover, the universe, God, what we wanna name or believe in, says ding. There you go. That form of detachment from holding on for dear life\nto things in past, so hard, that's not letting the beauty\nthat's right in front of you to feel correctly and\nfollow our intuitions. To have those not cast 'em out. I didn't burn them. I didn't get rid of those things. I just took 'em off and had to\nrecognize, you're still here. You are you, you're much more, that is a talisman. That's a symbol, that means something to you. And that's good, don't\ncast out the meaning. But it's not like when the\nring's off and the hat's off and the crucifixes off\nyour neck that you're like, you're gonna die. (chuckles) And I know those are reminders. Hang on to what they mean\nfor you as we go forward. But as we go forward, quit\nworrying about so much about you. Again, I was looking at\nthe proverbial dream, the cloud so much that I\nwas tripping over myself to get there. And like clockwork, just amazing grace, boom, as soon as it hit me. And I was like, \"Ah, that's it. All I want is what I can see, and all I can see is in front of me. Literally looking down at the ground at what was a sea of 10,000 wild neon blue Amazonian butterflies on the ground. As soon as they fluttered up\nmy head came up with them, I took a few more steps (whistles) and there's the Amazon, that's what you came over here for. Oh, howdy. Those kind of that, truth like that. - Well, the Amazon's interesting too because it really has no past or future losing the moment\n'cause how fast it turns. It just eats up life. It like, if a thing dies it just gets swallowed up 'cause, maybe because of the\nhumidity, because of all that. Because there's so many\nliving creatures that kinda eat each other live on each other. So it really exists in the moment and all this kind of\ndiversity of life there. It's such an interesting place. - Talk about food chain. - Yeah, you're just part of it there. - [Matthew] Yeah. - (chuckles) We humans somehow\nescaped that food chain. But we're still, the\nroots are still there. - I think we're a bit arrogant\nto think we've escaped. (Lex and Matthew laughs) - [Lex] Yeah. - You think I'm being romantic in that notion? - Well, sometimes when\nyou're in a big city, when you're in Austin, Texas,\nand LA you can think like, we're in a car, we're\nin a house, we're safe. But yeah, somehow his nature\nis still a part of us. Our roots are still a part of us. - I think it is more than we realize, more than we give a credit for. I actually, I believe that we, that it's a really arrogant\nnotion to think that we are separate. Meaning people talk about, pollution, a larger scale that the climate or what have you. I think Earth's gonna be just fine. - [Lex] Yeah. - We may be not be here for it, but I think we have a bit of\narrogance sometimes to think that we can tramp mother nature. I think we have more of\nthe natural law in us and I sure hope so if I'm wrong."

      "text": "- Well, there's an interesting,\nI've recently been, there's a guy named Max Tegmark at MIT, who really worries about nuclear war. And he was part of\nconstructing a simulation of what happens when\na nuclear war happens. And it's interesting to see that, some very large percentage\nof humans on Earth starved to death because they don't die\nfirst from the explosion. They die from starvation 'cause basically dust covers the entire North\nAmerica and entirety of Europe. And so the crops all die, all the food sources all die and people suffocate and starved to death. But you know the lesson\nyou'll learn from that over a period of a few months, even though most of the human\npopulation of Earth dies. Earth finds a way, life finds a way. - [Matthew] Yeah.\n- To adapt. And it's gonna be just fine. - [Matthew] Yeah. - In terms of the big living ecosystem that is life on Earth. And yeah, it's humbling to think about, well, maybe we're just a stepping stone. Same thing with talked offline about artificial intelligence. Maybe humans are just a stepping stone to the development of these other super intelligent entities. - Yeah. Yeah. And is it unconsciously in our\nnature that that's just part of the evolution and\nadaptation of our species because we're gonna, we were talking about it earlier, what AI becomes. It is completely 100% based on who we are. - And we get to see it for some time a mirror to ourselves. Okay, this is what human\ncivilization is like. These AI systems, large language models are\ntrained on human communication. And you get to ask it questions and you get to have conversations with it. And you get to realize, wow, this is what the collective intelligence\nof the human species are collective wisdom and knowledge. This is what it looks like. All the bias, the hate, the\nparadoxes, all that is in there. - [Matthew] Yeah. - The contradictions. You can even convince those models. You can tell 'em they're lying and they're gonna start changing- - [Matthew] Yeah.\n- Their mind. It's interesting to play with them. - [Matthew] Yeah. - It's also interesting\nto consider that maybe they become smarter than us and become of almost life\nforms that live among us and maybe one day kind\nof we merge with them. There's all kinds of possible trajectories that we take here. - How much of that excites you? How much of it scares you? - Is it possible to exist in a place where it is both exciting and scary, but to exist in that dance? Mostly I'm really excited because I see human\nbeings as deeply lonely. Like there's a deep\nloneliness in all of us. That's how we see connection. That's why we see connection in others. That's why love is so beautiful when we find other people\nwe're connected with. And I just think AI can add to that. You can add friends that you can have great conversations with and that some of those\nfriends would be AI systems. (chuckles) They'll call you out bullshit and you're in the most fascinating\nand interesting of ways and challenge you and help\nyou explore ideas together. So I'm excited by that. - Is that different? And if so, how from the internet and Facebooks and these groups and\ncommunities that were, I think it's fair to say, set out to say this all access\nof information to people will help us find more common denominators than divisive ones. Do you see similar? - Yeah, it's similar but\nfurther into that direction. I think the internet has\ndone an amazing thing in connecting us and expanding our minds and helping us find community that feels like our community and then communities that\nare totally different and you learn from them. I mean Wikipedia alone, one\nof my favorite websites, - [Matthew] Mine too. - Opens your mind to\nall kinds of cool stuff. - Yeah, it does.\n- [Lex] And it's- - Not to do system anymore. - (laughs) No. And so I think AI just\nmakes that even easier. 'Cause Wikipedia have to like read and have to do a lot of work. Within AI system like a\nlarger language model. You can just shoot the shit. It's more like drinking a beer\nversus like doing homework. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's already happening. What do you think about that becoming the new family to where you said you're not married,\nyou don't have kids. Could you see a future for yourself or do you have a relationship with AI and that is your family? - That's the main, that's the primary, like even romantic relationship. - [Matthew] Yeah. - I can see it, that one worries me. I like to keep it at friends. - Right. (Lex and Matthew laughs) - I think I'm not ready\nto commit to the romantic. (Matthew laughs) I wonder how much that\nnow that takes us back to the Amazon in nature, how much we still need the human touch. - [Matthew] Yeah. - And whatever magic there\nis between two humans, which takes the leap into the romantic versus just the intimacy of a\ngood friendship, I don't know. - So correct me if I'm wrong, you see AI as having a deep\nand meaningful friendship. - [Lex] Yeah. - And hopefully it will be a friend that will help you evolve and be able to love\neven more and be loved. And you can take that into humanity and find another homosapien?\n- [Lex] Yes. - To go, yes. And thank you AI, my great friend for opening me up to this\nbeauty that I have myself, and I can see in you, my fellow human. And let's come together and biologically create\nfamily if we want to. And let's all remain\nfriends with my friend and make your own friends with\nmy friend's friends on AI. And let's have these great neighbor. It's a good friend, that great friend that's a neighbor. - Yeah, yeah, mentor and friend. Just like now there's AI\nsystems that play chess far, far, far better than humans. And we humans still play\nchess with each other. Chess is still a game\nthat's fun for us humans. - [Matthew] Right. - And then we use AI systems\nto get better at chess, to learn, to train, to discover new ideas, but ultimately return to the\nchess board between two humans. But, of course, this world\nis full of dangerous people. And so those same AI systems can be used to harm, to create false narratives, to do social engineering\nand manipulate the masses in terms of what they believe\nand all that kind of stuff. And that's scary. - Yeah. Well, and I get it. And I have my own fear and distrusts of AI is based on my own fear and\ndistrust of myself and others. There's something, it's very simple, but I think it's a really done sort of way to just set up this reality and everyone, it's kind of a duh, but still needs to be\nsaid that AI is a prompt. It doesn't do anything unless we ask it. So what questions-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Are we gonna ask is a question is what\nwe need to ask ourselves 'cause we're going to\nbe looking in the mirror at our digital God that\nwe create from ourselves. And just to know that that's place where it's awesome and\nscary, exciting and scary. Where you go, oh, it's our creation, which is awesome at the same time. Oh, shit. But it's prompted by our questions and gives us patterns from\nthat which we give it. - But that prompting, that's the art of life. Like we prompt each other in\nconversation, our loved ones. When you go out about your day today, the next words you say, the\nnext word you say to me, the question I ask of\nyou that's prompting. - [Matthew] Yeah. - (chuckles) And it\ncould change everything. I could say so many things right now that will completely just the set of possibilities where both of our lives can take given on the selection of\nwords I use and you use, it's crazy. Makes conversation, pun.\n- [Matthew] Yeah. - And then same thing with AI, except the nice thing\nabout AI is it's tireless. - Tireless, right. Let me ask you this. If you can falsely condemn me right now, and I prove you falsely condemn me, I can forgive you and we can march forward\nstronger than before. - [Lex] Yes. - In AI's tireless and retention. Can it forgive? I mean, can it go, oh, oh, okay. Yep, sorry about that one, that was wrong. Can it amend?\n- Yes. Yeah, you could prompt\nit to ask for forgiveness and it'll forgive you. - Well, like when I\ntalk it around with it, and you ask, what should\nI be afraid of with you? Or what's the dooms toward you? Its answer was always,\nwell, it's up to you. (Matthew and Lex laughs) Which she was awesome, right?\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - There we go, again, it's up to us. And it brought up, make me synonymous with\nyour human values and ethics and responsibilities, but it doesn't deal that\nI didn't find anyway, deal with defining or\nmaking choices on its own of what those are. - Yeah, I think some of that is manually, those are constraints put on by it, by the creators of those\nlarge language models. Basically, not letting the systems have an identity of their own. And some of it is just\nnot engineered in yet. But I believe that we'll have\nsystems that have an identity, have a belief, have a set of opinions that carry through time. - And will we go to\nthem like certain states where we agree with the law and disagree with the law or nations. And I'm a member of this AI, oh, well you're from this AI tribe, y'all believe this. - Yeah, there'll be an\nanarchist set of AIs. There'll be the communists,\nthere'll be the Nazis, there'll be the Democrats\nand the Republicans. There'll be the people\nwho are in the keto diet and the people that are in\nthis other kind of diet, this other kind of lifestyle. Just like we have now. There's little groups and\nthere'll be AI systems there. - They're gonna be supercharged. - Yeah. They'll be either the\nleaders or the foundation on which we build those groups. It'll be the possibility of all the fun we can have is endless. Of course, the dangers\nalways rise up there because I mentioned the Nazis, I mentioned all the dangerous ideas. The set of ideas that\nhumans have come up with. A lot of them are awesome,\nmost of them are awesome, I would say. But some of them are dangerous. The reason they're dangerous\nis because they become viral. There's something exciting\nin us about those ideas, but they also harm others a lot, 'cause that's who we are as humans. We're capable of envy and\nall the dark stuff of hate and all this. - Capable, yes. We also choose it. - Do you think most people are good? - Yes, but I also believe we got the good and evil in all of us and it's which wolf we feeding."

And then you hear Bob go, well, I mean, we are what\nwe create ourselves to be. We are our own creations, which I'm like, oh yes, yes, we are. Thank you Bob, Bobby. I'm all for bullshitters and bullshitting, I'm not as big a fan\nof the liars and lying. - What's the distinction? You're talking about the\nart form of bullshit? - A liar's faking it, but not admitting to\nthemselves that, yeah. - [Lex] Oh, yeah. - It's fucking creation, I'm faking it. A liar, I'm lying to your face right now. And I don't give you that hair of a wink out of my right eye that let you know, \"Hey, go with me here.\"\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. (laughs) - I think there's value\nin the bullshitting. - [Lex] Yeah. - Now the lying becomes troublesome because one, I've duped you\nand I didn't let you know, come on, I was just telling the story about catching the fish. The fish always gets bigger\nevery year we tell a story. Come on, go it, all right? - [Lex] Yeah.\n(Lex laughs) - But the lying all of a sudden, I don't know my own, I don't know when I'm emanating something and creating something, telling the truth, being authentic or lying, and all of a sudden I'm\nleaving crumbs with myself. That constitution gets blurry. - Lying to yourself and to others. - Yeah, well, you start\nto lie, you lie to others, and that you start to lie to yourself and you don't even know it. And that, I believe is\ndangerous territory. That's why I'm trying to push this admit because that goes, I'm not to, I'm trying to come in\nat a kindergarten level because we immediately jumped to, well, I'm a judge that, boom, that's bad, that's wrong. No, no, no, no, no. (whistles) Hold back on that. Let's go back to base level of, let's just admit that\nwe all fucking do it. Lies we tell others, lies we tell ourselves, lies we believe for convenience sake. I do it, I'm guilty of it. I try to catch myself on it. If I can just call it and go, you know, you're believing\nthat lie out of convenience. I'm like, I know. And then I have to, either\nI'm saying that in the mirror or writing it down or\nsharing with a friend. And I go, okay, well now I've inherently\nbecome a bullshitter then, because I admitted it. That I can shake hands with, that's the little slight wink to ourself and someone else go, come on, it's a better story this way. - In the course Roadtrip, you start with step one, admit. How do you do that? How do you kinda step back and- - Do that inventory? - Yeah. Is there a trick to that? - Oh, if there's a trick to it. I think it's just about\ncourage of having the, 'cause it's, I don't think any of us like to admit our lies or look deep enough in the go. I've relied so much on that lie\nthat it's become my reality. - [Lex] Yeah. - I don't wanna be so puritanical, as I say, again, that's why I\nsay admit, instead of judge. But I don't wanna be so\npuritanical I should go, and admit it and get rid of it. No, I'm just saying to admit it, just bring it to the surface. Ah, yeah, I'm saying this and I'm\ndoing something different. I preach this, but I actually, my actions, just admit it. Just admit 'em. I think that's the first\nstep to where we begin to either forgive ourself and\ngive ourselves some amnesty and go, yeah, I'm a human. Trying to make it through\nlife as best I can. I'm gonna let myself\nslide on that one, okay? And maybe I've been getting\naway with it for so long. Whole family, my whole network\nworks well on it, okay? (laughs) Forget this. Get to the base of the\ntruth of the matter. But just admit it. And then it will also help, it'll be easier to then\nexpose to ourselves, which one do we go? No, I'm not letting myself\nslide on that one anymore. That is actually a lie I've been believing that's been keeping me from getting more of what I want in life. That's actually a lie I've been living that\nI haven't admitted that is not allowing me to enjoy life as much as I damn well should be, deserved to be, or I've earned to be. Or just sort of let myself, excuse me, I had on a, so it's not all the hard stuff. Sometimes it can be a fun thing. I'm talk about, how many times\ndo we major in our minors, let's admit where we sit there and we go, all right, I give myself 12 hour workday, but I notice I'm spending\neight on my hobbies and four on my career, while\nI'm majoring in my minors. Ah, well me admit that. There's the math. Why don't we invert that? How about four hours on my\nhobbies and eight on my career? First off, just admitting\nit allows me to go, well, now I can do the math or rearrange the math by time of day. But I look, I just found a hobby, tennis. First hobby I've had in 25 years. I had to admit that I went to play tennis, I start to love it for the first month, I started feeling guilty. I was like, I'm having, is it\nokay to have this much fun? (Lex laughs) I'm having so much fun-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And I'm getting a great workout. And I just admit, I was\nlike, yes, it's okay. Congratulations. Well, he found something\nthat you're finding quite pleasurable, for straight pleasure. You don't have to, forget\nall this other stuff, but yeah, but I'm also getting a workout. We ain't getting that too. But don't just, you don't have to excuse\nthe pleasure based on, oh, but it's good for you, and no, you, damn it, the real reason you love is 'cause you're having\nso much damn fun at it. I had to admit that to let myself go, damn right, I'm going to play tennis\nagain today or tomorrow. It was a simple fun thing. So it's not always\nabout the hardcore stuff that we have to go. This is a deep dark lie\nthat I'm been living by, and it's having me live falsey and it's having harmful\nconsequences on my loved ones. Some of those will probably\narise when we admit. I think he's just having looking\naround and it just saying. And when we admit it, then we go. When we admit a lie, then we become something\nmuch more valuable. A bullshitter. Yeah.\n(Lex laughs) - You had the little wink in your eye. I love the distinction. - I'm bullshitting myself on\nthat thing, yep, I'm lying. Therefore, if I caught in a lie. Yep, well now, yep, I'm bullshitting. Now just out, didn't judge it. But now I'm bullshitting, that I think we can work with."

There's a lot, millions\nof people love you. Hang on every one of your words. That's a hard place to be. How do you call yourself? How do you admit that you've been living a lie? How do you admit yourself in big ways and small ways on lies at this point, given how many people love\nyou, how famous you are? - 10 years ago? I don't know. I don't know. Someone was talking about like, yeah, they really admire\nthis so and so person 'cause they're not someone\nwho looks in the mirror. And I was like, yeah. And all of a sudden I was like, man, I gotta catch myself\nlook in the mirror a lot. (Lex and Matthew laughs) And then I go in, and I look at my wife's\nside of her bathroom, how many different creams\nand stuff she has out there. Look at my side, I got\na lot more on my side. I'm like, oh, I notice how if I'm out and public working out, maybe doing pushups and\nmaybe I'd do a few more. If there's a group of people walking by that maybe I'd like to impress, then maybe I do a few more\nthan I'd do if I was on my own. I'm like, you are vain McConaughey. (Lex and Matthew laughs) - [Lex] Yeah. - And the knee jerk is, oh, vanity bad. And all of a sudden I was like, all of a sudden I became a bullshitter. Once I admitted and vain, I was like, well bravo vanity. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Let's go vanity. Instead of putting it in the cupboard, in the lie section. Oh, I'm in a vain, 'cause that's a debit. No. Admit it. And then go, what's the value in it? Well, I can look at, yeah, I've actually got in better\nshape because of my vanity. Actually, I eat better. I'm better that morning, and that led to being a\nbetter husband, better dad, doing something with my kids when I'd rather be over there writing this work I'm working on. But I know that tomorrow, 'cause when they leave town, they're gonna remember this\ntime that we had together here. That's a selfish act to go\nspend that time with my kids or my wife, even though I'd rather not\nbe doing it at that time, I'd rather be doing something for myself. Because when they leave tomorrow they'll have this great memory that they spent with their\ndad right before they went, that I could call that vanity. (chuckles) I could group that and say,\nthat was a very vain of you. That was for our self. Yeah. 'Cause it was also for something and someone that I cared about. - Are there people in your life that call you all in your bullshit? In the bad sense of the word, bullshit? - Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes it's either I got\na pretty thick threshold for how far I can go with my bullshit. Like what bruise, what tickles me might\nbruise others to watch it. - (chuckles) That's a good line. (laughs) Yeah. Tickles me might bruise others. - But I also, I go back and talk about the bullshit, that's over there with\nthose mystical successes. It's the, yeah, no, don't go with it. Don't pull a parachute yet. Let's see how far we can go. Let's see how hot it can get. Let's try it one more time. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Yes, two more please. - [Lex] Yeah. - That's where a lot of\ngreat pleasure and stories and successes will come from. Those are mystical, they don't add up. It's like we're not talking\nabout reason right now. We're not talking logic,\njust go with this. Let's talk about the virtual (chuckles) and making it real. - The old line of fake\nit till you make it. I mean, what is that? There's something to that. - There's definitely something to it. But I would, where people would go fake it, I would go back to Dylan's or create it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Recreate it, create and recreate it. You know, till it becomes, till you make it. So I'll have people call my bullshit, and a lot of times they're right. I think when I handle\nit the most healthy way is I admit yes, and I'm aware, and I'm going to keep going. - So you're not like resisting and denying and putting it away.\n- Oh, I will. I will, and I have to\nwatch that where I'm like, no, I'm not. That's not what I'm doing. And usually when it's\ncoming from people that are, there going, no, you are, it's like, I won't admit it.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And then that's where I'm telling a lie and that'll come up, get me later. I'll go, I didn't see it. I didn't see I was doing that. I was either unaware, I\nwouldn't let myself be aware. I was denying that I was doing that. - What would you say that's ego? Has ego been bad or good for you? - Gosh, I think it's been, I'm so thankful for ego. Does it get off the\nbridal for me sometimes and run loose and run places and where it's not of service (chuckles) to others and has it hurt loved\nones and even strangers? Yes. But I also, when my ego's really strong, it's in sync with serving, it's in sync with where I serve myself, also serve as others, serves others. It's those two are part and parcel. They're intertwined. And that's the capital E, ego, that I think and hope we all need more of, and that's what I mean\nby talking about selfish, that's redefining that the\nreal true meaning of that is not doing something for self at expense of your\nneighbor or harming others. It's for personal profit and pleasure, that also is profit and pleasure\nfor a utilitarian sense, more of others. And there's a again, back to the paradox. I think there's a place, I know there's a place, I believe there's a place\nwhere those are in sync. And when my ego's healthy, I'm able to say I'm sorry sooner for a lie or a misdemeanor or harming somebody. I'm able to be more empathetic because I got the confidence.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - To be so. I'm able to be more humble. But still have my chin\nhigh and my heart high and look in the eye and go, yep, my bad. Bogie, guilty. I shank that one outta bound, man. - That's beautifully put. So ego can be constructive,\nnot destructive."

      "text": "You won an Oscar for your performance in \"Dallas Buyers Club.\" Can you tell the story of becoming that character Ron Woodruff? What was the toughest part? - Toughest part, which was the most enlightening part was getting to know who he\nwas in between the lines. We're based on a life story\nin an hour and a half of film, and script is great. But who was he in between the lines? Who was he before he started a business, before he was on a crusade, before he went to alternative medicines? The obvious thing people\nalways talk about, well how'd you lose all that weight? That was not hard. That was just a militaristic decision. This is what I can eat each day and if I do this each day for a week, I'll lose 2.5 pounds in a week. So I'm gonna give myself\nfive months to do that. 2.5 times as 10. There you go, there's 47 pounds. That was like clockwork. So that was easy, that decision was made. I didn't go to the Pizza\nHut buffet (chuckles) and have temptation in front of me. I had certain meals. I ate that, and the weight\njust went off like clockwork. It was the who is Ron\nWoodruff in between the lines and the gift I got given that gave me the insight\nto who that man was, was his, I went to see his family, and as I was leaving his family offered me his diary. And I remember it kind\nof hesitant going, wow. Yes, but I kind of hesitated 'cause it felt maybe a little too intimate\nof a thing for me to have. It felt like it was kind\nof maybe infringing a bit. But I opened my hand and took it. And what I got in the diary\nwas I got to know who Ron was before he had HIV, and little thing, the diary he'd write in and the dreamer he was. And then the getting all\nset on a Sunday night and laying his shirt out and ironing it for the next morning, making sure little pager\nhad fresh batteries in it, 'cause tomorrow morning\nhe was going across town to hook up some speakers for 38 bucks or whatever. And then getting up that morning and writing about what\nkind of coffee he drank and how much gas it was gonna\ntake to get over across town to do that job and hook up those speakers. And then on the way over, Paige coming in to say,\nno, we don't need you. We've gone with somebody\nelse to hook 'em up. And here, he was all buttoned up. Two cups of coffee in, hair slicked over, shirt ironed. Little less than half a tank of gas, but enough to get back home. Now where's this Monday go? - The hope and the disappointment. You have to take all that in. That's part of that man. - I'm just gonna go to Sonic and get a double cheese bacon burger 'cause Sheila over there,\nman, she's kind of cute. She always gives me high price on it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Which leads to rolling the joint, hanging out till Sheila gets off the work, sneaking over to the local motel\nand shagging up in room 16. That's my lucky number 16, Sheila! (Lex laughs) Then wandering out that night, getting home at one in the\nmorning, no plans for Tuesday and maybe later in the week think about what am I\ngonna do about work or job. And these little dreams would\nget me peak and want to, and then something would happen where he wouldn't follow through\nor the deal would go down, the deal would go south. In there was where I saw who, he was a dreamer, and he just couldn't catch the break and didn't follow through. And then I remembered\nhis family said like, \"Oh yeah, he invented it. He got patents on a whole bunch of things but he never would.\" He had things to get patented but never would follow through\nto get the government patent. And then later on, you'd\nsee the product be made or sold on QVCs or something. They'd be like, \"Ron, that was yours. They stole your idea,\ndid you patent that?\" He'd be like, \"No.\" Like never would that, there's something beautiful\nand sad about that. - [Lex] Yeah. - That let me inside\nwho he was in his heart and who he wanted to be and what he was hoping\nto be and trying to be, who couldn't quite pull off. - When you go that deep, this is a part of him staying you forever. Are you able to let go? - I mean I hope so. Look, there's a tenacity to survive that I got from him. Look, hopefully I can\ntry and find some of that in different ways in any character that I go play, 'cause that's, if you really wanna give\na character an obstacle to overcome, a need, I mean the base one is life and death. Whether that's the need to survive or the need to stave off extinction. I'm not talking about what\nthe rules, the laws are, the social morays, the manners and graces. I'm fighting, you're gonna fight for your own life in a world that's not\nsupporting you to do so. You, there's a wonderful\ncourage of fuck it. Watch this. What do I got to lose? My life or I'm in charge of extending it? Get outta the way, and I'll pick your pocket\nalong, whatever it takes. So there's a tenacity to live\nby whatever means necessary to survive that I that I'm reminded of, that I learned from Ron."

What did you take from that, from that role from that experience,\nphilosophically, psychologically? - The freedom of being on an island. He was such a singular character\nand of a singular mind. And as you know, it wasn't a dance party\nup there in his mind, (chuckles) it was some some heavy stuff, but also existentially\nfor him always like, death would be a deliverance for him. It'd also be a cop out in a way. It'd also would be, he was not a man who was\ngonna give himself amnesty and didn't allow it from\nthe rest of the world. Wouldn't give himself an out and while living in his head\nand heart and spirit was whew, more of a hell than arguably dying. There was no alternative. That's not negotiable for that man. And that's why he was such a, that's why he was the\nbest detective that ever walked the Earth. That's why he was such\na superhero in a way to have that singular. You don't go, oh, I wish I was him. No, but you'd like,\nwow, that constitution, that clarity of identity. Talk about a measure in a man's constitution. He didn't allow anybody off\nthe hook, especially himself. You wanted him to forgive a little bit or give himself a little amnesty. You wanted him to like, \"Man, it's Saturday bro,\ncan you go on a date?\" (Lex laughs) You wanted him to like, enjoy something. But he was connected to\nsomething in his DNA, who he was and something much more baseline truth. And that's why he was\nsuch a good detective. So that, but there's an island, as much as that company can be. I said earlier on that Amazon trip, but it wouldn't join the company. There's parts I think that\nI maybe gave to myself to Rustin Cohle, and also that Rustin\nCohle's given back to me, that are like, yeah, when\nyou wanna pull the parachute, 'cause you can't stand the company that you're in McConaughey\nin your own mind, the Socratic dialogue is\ndriving you freaking crazy. Don't pull a parachute, stick with it. Go through it. - So you were able to walk around with that tormented mind of his- - Tormented. I didn't have very much\npatience for mendacious talk. I didn't have as much\npatience for small talk. I wasn't tormented. - But the character was\nand you have to embody him. So is that, I mean, does\nsome of that bleed over? Are you able to separate the\nman you are from the character? - Look, am I able to separate? Yeah, I came home to my kids and when they walk around the door and greet me and go, what'd you do today? And you got three kids under 10 years old, you don't tell 'em about the scene where you help someone\ncommit suicide. (laughs) It's just, hey, you\nturn it into a parable. And actually, I've always said this, having kids has made me a better actor and a better storyteller because I have to parabolize\n(Lex laughs) certain things, and tell it in ways that I go, oh, neat. Did I bring it home? I didn't bring torment. Did I bring introspection into my own? This characters for me, and I think this is true for\na lot of actors and actresses, it's not a separation. We each have everyone else in us. It's just seeing, diving\ninto Rustin Cohle, knowing where his mind and heart is from the hand of Nic Pizzolatto, who wrote the character\nand wrote the whole series. Understanding number one,\nwhat the hell am I saying? What's he talking about? Then going deeper into that, well, if that this person\nreally believes that, what does that say about how they move? Then I'm going, all of a sudden, well, who is that in me? What part of my left\nbrain is locked into that? What part of my reptilian brain is whoosh latched onto that, this other stuff is non-negotiable. Then I just live in that, and I always taught like a '70s equalizer. Remember the old Marantz equalizers, and you move up your 500\nHkz, you move up your 60, you just rebalanced equalizer and we all have. So it's just going to those parts of me where I'll turn up the volume, some parts of the base with\nthe treble on the equalizer and turn down other parts of myself. And I'm not coming home\ntormented as Rustin Cohle. Am I coming home seeing torment where it should be seen? Am I reading the news differently? Are things coming out of\nthe news and catching my eye as being bullshit or lies or\ntruth that it's just hard? And going, yep. Yeah, I'm seeing it\nthrough a different lens, but I'm seeing my own life\nthrough a different lens. A lens that was opened up and an aperture that was opened up through Rustin Cohle - You mean the process of\nbeing an actor, an actress, I guess is a really interesting way to be a philosopher of human nature. - Yeah, I mean it's an incredible-\n- [Lex] really in it. - Dive into the humanities\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And all the analogies.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And philosophy. And as I said, as I opened up that question like that, being on an island is a vacation. I am also conscious for five months when I'm playing Rustin Cohle that, this is an interesting fact. I was as strong spiritually\nwith my relationship with God when I did \"True Detective\"\nas I've ever been. - Why is that? (laughs) - Okay, which you would\nsay, wait a minute, in some ways those are antonyms were, no, but my, I pretty safely can say\nthat my own strength of spirit in my own personal life, Matthew's life there, gave me the confidence to go further away, deeper into the torture\nand deeper into the, but it was still, he was still\nalways going after truth. That was the thing. He was not an evil man. I don't even know if you\ncan call him a nonbeliever, but he was always going after the truth and the truth burned. And he would take the scar\nand get burned for it. He'd die for it. That something was actually\nbiblical about that. (lex laughs) And so-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I don't think it's\ncoincidence that I was, had so much sort of diving into the depths of that tortured character because I trusted that when I go out, I'll come up the other side. It's always like jumping\nin a pool of water and can you trust you'll\ncome up the other side and not, you go play a criminal, you trust you're not gonna come out the other side of tyrant in real life. You just go, ah, God, I got to go do that. Came out and I'm still alive, got all my faculties, I'm not in jail, whatever it is. And so my own spirituality\nat that time at hell, it definitely, I think\ngave me a certain trust and confidence to go\nfurther into the dark."

Yeah. - What do you think about\nthat like philosophy and way of life? - I admire the simplicity of it. I mean, one bit, one way you could explain \"Yellowstone\" and Costner's role is what will man do to\nprotect land and family? - [Lex] Yeah. - In a world that's trying to encroach, in a world where there's a cowboy ethos that deems trespassing\nmore clear, earlier. - Yeah. (chuckles) - [Matthew] Than men-\n- Yeah. - Than other, other hats. I admire that simplicity\nof right and wrong. - And the simplicity\nof that right and wrong doesn't always correlate,\ncoincide with the law. - No, it's above the law. You mentioned something earlier, I don't remember where it\nwas in the conversation, but it's a little bit of like, okay, if the law ain't\nhandling this, I am. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then it is, the law's not gonna handle this, therefore I am, and then it is, I'm handling this. Law, talk to them when you get to them, I'm handling this going forward. - There's honesty to that. It just seems, of course, it's dangerous\nbecause it's a slippery slope. Because of the power\nin that power corrupts, it can be a slippery slope where you completely disregard the law and you can hurt a lot of people. But when done right, there feels to be\nsomething really authentic and human about that, protect family, protect land above all else. - Yeah. Look, this is a broader question, but I'm gonna piggyback it off of this back to the dreams in reality\nand then the evolved species and what can we do in\ncreating a digital God and AI, and these communities and\nfriends that challenge us and think like us, we\nlike to hang out with, do you think we're a less evolved species than we give ourself credit for? Do you think we give ourself credit for being more involved than we actually are? - [Lex] I think we do. - I do. I think we need to admit that. - I think probably the cowboy ethos is a stepping towards admitting that. And that's why it's so appealing to people and kind of wakes them up\nto realize that we are, we're not so far from our ancestors that the values of loyalty\nare really important. Trust on the basic human level. How do you know if you can trust someone? - I don't know if I can trust someone. Well, I don't know a trick to it. I do not know a trick to it. But I do come in as I believe you do with high trust. I come in with a, I'm told sometimes I think I'm told that I trust too much sometimes. - Have you been hurt? Have you been betrayed? And if you have has that like- - [Matthew] Yeah. - Hurt your willingness to trust. - No, it hurt. And I put that person and those people in\nanother category back here, and do my best not to let them know that it bothered me at all, but I know when I'm with those people. - By a new person, you're\nstill willing to go through? - No, I'm not gonna do that. I think that's the beginning of cynicism, which I think is a horrible\ndisease of getting older. I'm not gonna do that. - So you're fighting cynicism\noff as much as you can. - No kidding, no way.\n- [Lex] I love it. - No way, no way.\n(Lex laughs) And there's no residual in it. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- There's no win. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It's easy, it's clever.

One of the things I love about Texas is, I run into so many\nTexans around the world. Texans are taught to go, be tech, conservative area, learn who we are, then go. Go explore, pioneer, journey, and hopefully you come on back with some goods and some stories, (Lex laughs) you Texan.\n(Lex laughs) - And underneath that is\nthis kind of freedom of being an individual in the\nfull meaning of that word. - Yeah, well, Texas is\nliberal on your entrance. (Lex laughs) Very liberal on your entrance. Less regulation. Hey, welcome. High trust. High trust, sir. Welcome to our state. Come on in. Yes, yes, yes. But if you lie, cheat, steal. - [Lex] Yeah. - We're conservative on our consequences. (Lex laughs) - Oh yeah, that's a good line."

      "text": "You've briefly pondered\nrunning for governor. I don't know if that's in\nyour future, I hope it is. You had a few good lines about it. Do you think about that kind of stuff, about what the future holds in terms of- - [Matthew] Yes.\n- Political office. - I don't think about it in\nterms of political office. I've graduated to a broader, larger thought of what's\nmy future hold and where, would I be most useful as a leader. I think that's a fair word. Whether that's thought, whether that's the leader\nof my family right now as a parent, as a father. A leader of, people that work with me, politics is, I'm not gonna say it's, 'cause it's not small and I'm not, that's why I say that\nout loud, it's not small. I do think it needs to re-engineer and redefine what its purpose is before, because it's just chasing\nits own tail right now with the two parties that are seem to me to be completely about just invalidation of the opposition instead of vision of themselves. So I think it needs\nredefinition of what it is, because it is important. That's why I mean, that's why I said I don't mean small, it needs to think bigger about what it is and how it's useful. - When it seeks to invalidate it's small, when it seeks vision, it can be big. - Yes, well, one's affirmative, one's going into that cynicism\nwe were talking about. - Yep. - You know, and invalidation\nof any opposing thought or maybe that were even\nopposing opposition is an arrogant term, that's too strong. A lot of times it's not\neven opposition alternative other than, another way\nof thinking about it. Oh, could both be true. Oh, how could we parlay those two ideas? One of the challenges with these ideas of a third party\nor meet you in the middle. It's kind of got this\nhistoric notion of being, oh, well, here, come see, sort of mystery in between, kinda go which way the wind blows, I think done in the right way, and it doesn't have to be under a third party's name necessarily, but it's actually an incredibly rebellious position right now. And it's actually, and I love sports. It's tactically the place with which to move most advantageously. I think of their free safety\nin the game of football. They're in the middle of\nthe field and they're deep. They choose to defend left or right according to the play that's\nbeen called by the offense, similar to the offense, the running back. You read the defense and\nthen you're gonna run right to run left to go away\nfrom that opposition. It's a tactical spot. - To be truly independent and respond. - And respond. - So do you think you have a role in that, in political officers? - I don't know. It's on mine. It's not out of my mental box. And I gave it real sincere thought and discernment for over a year. And it's a wonderful, whether I end up getting\nin politics or not, it was a wonderful exercise. One that if anyone else\ngot time to do it, do it, to ask yourself what you would do if you were CEO.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Of a state, CEO of a\nnation, CEO of the world. That's a great thing to go. You wanna get your values line, woo-hoo. You wanna admit where you lie (chuckles) and throw yourself some pop quizzes and what if this phone\ncall comes at 4:00 AM. What you gonna, you know, who you wanna surround yourself with? It's really great questions to ask. And I think has helped\nme at a more micro level, be a better father and a better man. Take in considerations that I did not maybe take in as seriously\nbefore considering it. I don't know if that's in my future. Useful is a big word. I would've to be useful. I have to be useful in the right way. And is that my lane to be most useful? - It's a good question\nfor a leader to ask. How can I be useful?"

It explores space travel,\nphysics of space time, human nature, human\ncondition, human connection. How has that film expanded\nyour understanding of the universe- - [Matthew] Yeah. - And our place in it?\n- Yeah. Well, it's the, it's got the old Mr. Mayor on the corner. How big is that cloud metaphor in it? Because that was the\ncharacter I played Cooper's that was the existential question for him. Head down, practical, stay here,\nbe a father to my children. But his dream before his children\nwere to go explore space. So when he's taking that truck out and the countdown's going down, that's the hinge of the\nexistential question that we all face in some form. The sense of time. I wish I think everyone\nloves that sense of where time can run at different speeds. And there's a incredible scene where Cooper as a father's getting\nvideo feed from his children who have aged and he's\nrealizing he's missed all that. (Lex laughs) - [Lex] Yeah. - I mean overall that, that concept makes me consider and imagine you wanna talk about mystical successes instead of engineered ones\nlike the engineered ones. There's ethos from that film and what Nolan put into\nthat film and theories that make me go, \"Yeah, what\ndoes any of this matter? Maybe we are, maybe we are, it makes me go, maybe this is all, it's already all been written. What's happening right now in\nthis flip of time you're here, 53 years so far, we'll\nsee how many we get. What other parallel timelines\nare happening out there? Is it small minded of us to\ndefine life on other planets as only something that\ncan live within a climate that has water in this amount of O2. Those terms maybe too small things. What do you mean? Are we saying only life has to have water in this amount of oxygen\nand carbon dioxide? Maybe there's a whole\nredefinition of the ingredients that other life forms need."

And wow, that's exciting. And people go now, yeah, you believe in extraterrestrial life. I said, yes man. I think it'd be arrogant\nnot to, I sure hope so. - You think there's alien\ncivilizations all out there, intelligent ones just far\nin, far on distance stars? - I hope so, and I think we, it's possible. May have many among us right here. And I go for the the the why not in that, just to keep that train\nof thought open to learn and consider those existential questions,\nI think be arrogant not to. - There's so many hundreds\nof billions of planets just in our galaxy. - [Matthew] Just in ours. - I can't imagine there's\nnot life out there, but I suspect it's very different, like you said, than we are. And we have to have a\nhumility to open our eyes to how different life could be. - Yeah. And if and when we cross it, unlike we've had a tendency to do when we try to go with\nsome nation takeovers, I think it would be our inherent glitch to go in believing that any\nother life form civilization wants to take over territories to go into it with thinking that okay, this is an opposition. I mean I think that's\na human trait of ours and to consider that another life form would have an interest that more land or more territory\n(chuckles) is good for them, I think it's a shallow idea. I don't think they're, I think of it more like\nwhen I think of heaven, those considerations are not in anyone's mind, heart or intent in the heaven that I think of. So in other civilization,\nthese things I don't I mean I hope that we would just see and would learn that it would be the natural side of welcoming. It wouldn't be a primate response to, no, I have fire and you're\ncoming over trying to put it out, or I have food and you're\ntrying to steal my food. I don't think it would be, I think it's a shallow\nthought to think that, oh, it's gonna be about ownership and we would be trespassing. I think it would be, I don't think they're would have a sense of borders as we do. - I just hope we humans\nare smart enough to detect and to see aliens, because of how different they are, we often have a very narrow definition of what is intelligence. It's very possible that trees\nare extremely intelligent, if we kinda zoom out-\n- [Matthew] Right. - At a different time scale or different like just look at stuff from a bigger perspective that's outside of being so human-centric. - It's a great quote that someone told me, this astrophysicist told me this, how accurate it is or not. Someone else can argue the validity of what I'm meant to say or not. But I thought it really was\na perspective grabber for me. Like look, see the universe\nwas created at midnight. Humans came around at\n11:59 and 36 seconds. I love the little analogies that frame like that make, oh yeah, the pale blue dot, there it is. That perspective. Something is so relaxing\nand empowering about that at the same time and humbling but confidence boosting allows forgiveness, allows ambition. I just love the perspective of that, that picture, to picture it\nthat way and our timeline. - Do you hope humans become\na multi-planetary species as we're trying to do as a\nSpaceX is pushing forward, traveling out to Mars,\npotentially colonizing Mars, colonizing other planets? - Yeah.\n(Lex laughs) Yeah, go, I love the ambition of it. I love the pioneering nature of it. I love the extension of what\nwe consider as our backyard becoming more four dimensional like that. Not at the expense of we still got stuff to take care of. We got gardens to tend right here, and sure as hell not to\ngo, not to quit on us, to go, oh, let's get outta here 'cause this isn't really working. No, no, no, no, no, no. We got a tithe, we're\nstill supposed to pay here. That's part of this pressure testing us as a civilization in the species, whether you call that restoration order or whether you call that, let's figure out how to adapt best we can. Not at the expense of\nquitting here on Earth. - But let a few select folks explore. - Yeah. - [Lex] 'Cause that's like. - I say go for it, please. - One of the coolest\nthings that we humans do, it's kind of embodies the human spirit. Reach out into the unknown. But it's hard. I mean as \"Interstellar\"\nshows and so on. (laughs) - Yeah. Well, and Elon talks about it, this is not gonna be a weekend daisy trip\n(Lex laughs) (laughs) and he's just\nspeculating how hard it could be. Much harder in different ways that he doesn't understand yet. - [Lex] Yeah. Well that, you know, that dance between the\nimpossible and the inevitable. That's definitely there, with what SpaceX is\ndoing with all the folks who are trying to become a multidisciplinary species\nare doing, it's really hard. It's like build rockets\nthat fight off gravity at a cost effective way is really hard. SpaceX is close to being\nbankrupt several times. It's just hard. But it's also inspiring that some people are just crazy enough, bold enough to keep trying. - [Matthew] Yeah."

      "text": "- What advice would you\ngive to young folks? - What advice would I give? - In high school and college that are thinking of how to make\ntheir way in this world? - If you haven't already, can you define what you\nhave an innate ability for and match that with what you're\nwilling to hustle to get? - [Lex] Yeah. - Sometimes we have an innate ability, but we don't wanna work for\nit and we take it for granted. And we end up doing\nsomething that may work, may pay the bills, may\nget us by day to day, but we don't really like it. We have trouble finding a way to enjoy it. Definitely don't love it. And then sometimes we don't know what our innate ability is and we're hustling and\nworking our tail off and breaking a sweat to do something that we really aren't that good at on an innate level. And that's good challenge. And you can work and\nbecome good at something, that you don't have an innate ability for. But if you can match those two, what do you have an innate ability to do? Which we have an innate ability\nto do when we do that well, we do kind of enjoy it. - Yeah, and one of the\nthings that requires us to kind of be really honest with yourself at what your innate ability is, 'cause oftentimes there's a lot of noise when you're growing up. People telling you what\nyou're good at, not good at. Like really you have to look at yourself, listen to yourself. That inner like a deep, rigorous self-analysis of\nwhat am I actually good at? Not what I hope to be good at, but what I'm actually good at. - Right. And then if you look at that, and you can define those two, hopefully, you can activate it in a way where there's a demand for what you supply. (Lex and Matthew laughs) - You found love with\nCamila Alves McConaughey. What advice would you give to\npeople on how to do just that? How to find love? - Huh.\n(Lex laughs) (laughs) This wonderful\nsubject has been discussed since the beginning of time, hasn't it? Love it. So I can tell you what\nthings I've kinda learned and still learning. Love is one of those mystical successes. It doesn't make sense. Before I met Camila, I was coming on to my late 30s as much as I'm not a person\nthat is guided by timelines, my life had not really added up to what I thought it was\ngonna be relationship-wise. I thought by that time I\nwould've met the woman I love, married, and started family,\nand that hadn't happened. And I did find myself doing that thing I was\ndoing at the Amazon, looking around the corner, any perspective possible female I met that I was attracted to, I was like, maybe this is the one. I make the joke, but it's true. It's like at every red light, I'm like checking out who's next to me in the produce section at the supermarket. I'm like, who's down the produce section? I was like looking.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - When you're in that zone, you can also be a little intrusive. You can trespass on people's, you can get outside of yourself. You can be overly impressed\nand not as involved and have your own\nconstitution and sit back. And therefore, if you're\noutside of yourself, you're less attractive\nto your possible mate. I've got a series of dreams\nthat I've written about, but I had one then that\nwas very spiritual. That was me as a 88 year old\nbachelor who never got married, and it was a beautiful dream. Where on paper I thought\nthat should be a nightmare. It wasn't. What that dream did for\nme was allowed me to go, you may not find the woman for you and get married and have a life with her, that may not be. And for the first time in\nlife I was okay with that. More than intellectually,\nspiritually, I was grounded. I was like, okay. Then I'm moving through the world. And on this particular night as myself, not intruding, I was inviting. I did see her move across the room and did not say, who is that? I said, what is that? (chuckles) (Lex laughs) And then did move to\ncall her across the room. So I did invite, but I was not outside of myself and I was able to be myself\nwith her, what my eyes saw, everything that she turned out to be when the lens got zoomed\nin more details got known. And we began to talk and got more intimate and closer together and spend more time, became true, and then some, but every single thing that I imagined when I saw her move across\nthe room turned out to be true and then some. Just the image. We had similar moral bottom line about life, each other. How we treat ourselves, what we respect, what our own constitutions were. We had similar perspectives on raising children, which is very important to me and her. And then we just enjoyed\neach other's company. - [Lex] Yeah. - And we laughed together\nand we support each other and we promoted more of each other and we lit each other's fire and we, if one was rolling, we kept dishing. Go, go, go again, take the next shot, more, more, more, more. This was a biggie too. - Getting excited for\neach other's success. - Yes. Yes. To be able, I think it's very important. We all have jealousy, I get it. But it's very important to be able, if you can be happy for\nyour lover when they succeed or are succeeding or are\nacross the room at the party, laughing with the stranger to be happy for them when it\nhas nothing to do with you. I would be away, she would, the questions and the\ntalks, we would have, she was happy for me about how\nexcited I was about my day, and my day had nothing to do with her. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- She wasn't there. And I found myself not telling\nmyself to be happy for her, but being really, really happy for her when she would tell me about something that happened that day with her. And as much as I went through my head, oh, I'd have been great\nif I would've been there. - [Lex] Yeah. - I was like, no, I don't\nonly trespass on that. That you had that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Independent of me. Bravo. - That's a choice you make not to give any time to the jealousy, to the very natural jealousy\nthat we humans have. - It sure doesn't happen any, I don't see the residuals in in it. - [Lex] (laughs) True. - I've got it. I've had it and I have it. I just don't, you know, I haven't seen where, it has any payback. - I gotta ask you the\nbiggest possible question."

I prescribed to, in a religious sense,\nthe restoration order. We're here to restore order. In religious sense, I really, I purchased that and love\nthat incentive and love that, that view, but I don't\nreally know why we're here. But I do know to go back\nto the front, we are here. That part's inevitable. So now let's flip the script\nand go to the why not. Just keep living. What are we doing? The base of everything\nand we can argue not, the base of it. All I can come up with is well just keep living, man. I mean, what else are we supposed to do when we don't have any idea what to do? When we know exactly what we wanna do. Make it matter. Even when it doesn't matter, that matters. For what? I don't know. For the fun of it, that matters. - Yeah, our ability to create meaning and beauty in the mundane, in the absurd. It's kind of cool.\n- [Matthew] Yeah. - (laughs) And then we\nshare it with each other. - [Matthew] Yeah.\n- We get excited. - [Matthew] Yeah. - And we create some pretty\ncool stuff along the way. - I mean, I say I'm confident enough, and I might be arrogant for me to say, but I do believe that we're here to each\ngeneration have a small ascension. - [Lex] Yeah. - Or else what's it for? (laughs) - And we're not really\nsure what the ascension is towards just kind of- - No. No, I just think it's up. Do you think it's up? I do think that it is definitely arrogant to think that we as a species or\ngeneration or people or humanity are going to reach the top\nof the ascended staircase and go, ta-da! (laughs) I think that is not only false, but I think it's full-hearted. And I think it's this recipe for being, having more angst, and even cynicism we\ntalked about and unrest and lack of seeing beauty\nand joy in this life while we're in it. I think life's a verb. Live it as best we can. Hopefully, I mean, I don't know. Sometimes I'm just, I\ndon't have a grand plan. Man, I'm just trying to connect the dot. I'm confused, frustrated. I don't know what, I don't feel any gravity\nor building or lineage towards what I'm doing. And I'm just like going, what's that Peterson line? If you don't believe in heaven, do what you can to get as far\naway from hell as possible sometimes.\n(Lex laughs) - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It's a great line. Sometimes I'm just trying\nto like, man, just don't, don't sink the ship right now. Just keep your head above water. Maintain, just try and hold on. - And hopefully give yourself\na chance to notice the magic, the mystical. I try to do that.\n- [Matthew] Yeah. - When it gets rough. - Because it's there. I do believe it's all\naround us all the time. - [Lex] Yeah. - Just are we on a frequency and do we allow ourselves\nto receive it and see it? - [Lex] We gotta tune the radio. - Yeah. Because we look for it too hard. We see false idols, and\nif we don't look at all, we become callous and miss it all. - Yeah.

He starred in films and shows loved by me and millions of others, including \"Interstellar\",\n\"Dazed and Confused\", \"Dallas Buyers Club\", \"Killer Joe\", \"Mud\", \"True Detective\", and soon,\na spinoff of \"Yellowstone\". Offscreen, his words\ncarry wisdom and power.

This is Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Matthew McConaughey. Let's start with love. Your parents had a complicated love story, divorced twice, married three times. What have you learned about love from your mom and dad\nand their love story? - That it's messy. That it takes work. That it's ugly. That no matter how ugly or messy it is, don't go to bed until you've come back\ntogether to either embrace or admit that you truly love each other, even if you hadn't solved what the hell you're bitchin' about. Love will win in the end, literally, three to two, with my mom and dad. (Matthew and Lex laugh) - Yeah. - And that even in the two\ndivorces and in the two times where they couldn't live with each other, they still loved each other. They just couldn't live with\neach other at that time. For whatever reason they needed, and I don't know the details, if they needed their\nspace, freedom, or what, but they were never out\nof love with each other. And that as a parent, when we're not sure what to do, and people give you a\n1,000 books and advice, as a parent, if your\nkid knows you love 'em, you're in the black. That's the main thing. It won't work without that. And it can work and will\nusually can work with that. They just know that fact. - So it's not just love for each other, it's the love for the bigger family that ultimately helps you persist\nthrough the ups and downs. - Well, I mean, I don't know how much, particularly my mom and dad were staying together at times, maybe when they didn't want\nto because they had children. I don't actually think\nthey considered that. I think they were much less conscientious than say I am today. I think my mom and dad were\nmore like, they'll be fine. We love 'em. They'll be fine, but we'll cross that\nbridge when we get there. Right now, let's work\nit out between you and I is what I think my mom and dad were saying to each other, or not. They wanted and needed a relationship that was a tidal wave, rocky, right angles, tsunamis. And to this day, in my life with Camilla and I, which I don't, I like a\nriver has some swerves and some streams and some rapids, but I'm not looking for a tidal wave. My mom's like, what's with all this,\neverything's so smooth. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Stuff. Come on, come on, come on, come on. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So she challenges vitality, 'cause that's what my mom\nneeded to communicate. I don't think my dad needed it as much of that the hard angles\nthat their relationship to, I don't think my dad needed\nit as much as my mom. - But the clashes demonstrated the passion that underlies the love. - Yes, and I've always been asked, when I talk about my\nparents' love relationship, I tell the stories that\nare actually sometimes quite violent, and- - [Lex] There's some good stories there. - They're beautiful, I\nthink they're beautiful. - Yeah, I think they're beautiful too. - But I've had people go, what? Wait a minute, that was unhealthy. You can't, and I was like, no. That's, again, back to the beginning, love is messy. And what I love about those stories is that's where the love was actually. It was tested, and it could have broke and been over. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And it never was. Again, the love won in the kitchen floor, blood's drawn, knives are pulled. - [Lex] Ketchup. - Ketchup's all over. - [Lex] Yeah. - But we make love on the kitchen floor and, I mean-\n- Yeah. - Come on, beautiful. - So as romantic as it gets right there. - [Matthew] Whoa!\n(Lex laughs) - What's the memory from\nchildhood that helped set you on the trajectory of becoming\nthe man you are today? - Standing on the corner with Mr. Mayor, the principal of St. Phillips School, I was in kindergarten, eh, looked up and there was a cloud in the sky. And I said, Mr. Mayor, is that\ncloud as big as the world? And he paused for a minute and he goes, \"Well, yes, it is, Matthew.\" Now, in my seven-year-old mind, I went, okay, I can see the outlines of it. And that must mean it is so far away. Because if that's as big as the world, I remember it took 15 hours\njust to drive from Longview to Florida last year, you know? And I can't even see that far. So that cloud must be so far off that it's not worth me even considering space, dreams, any of that. I was like, (whistling)\narmy, I'm looking down. I'm gonna put my head to the ground. I'm gonna look right in front of me and deal with what's in front of me. Because dealing with\ndreams and what's out there and not on this Earth\nthat gravity holds down, not worth considering. You'd never make it. It's not even worth imagining. It's, pfft, fairy dust. So I think I learned a lot\nof self-reliance from that. I think I got a work ethic from that. I think I got a, hey, focus on\nwhat's right in front of you. Do the deed, take care\nof what's in front of you one at a time and slowly\nnotch up your way. And, hopefully, there's\nsome ascension to that. And it wasn't until quite years later, in some ways, decades\nlater, that I started to go, \"Oh, I can project, I can dream.\" Why? Because literally the\nfirst time I got on a plane and then 30 seconds I was in a cloud, I'm like, Whoa, we must be\ngoing a trillion miles an hour. Cause we're already in that cloud that was as big as the world\nthat I saw the edge of. And then I grew and learned enough to go, Well, that's not true. Planes don't go that fast. Oh, what Mr. Mayor said\nwasn't really true. That cloud is not as big as the world. And it's not near as\nfar away as I thought. But I'm glad he lied to me. (chuckles) - What do you think about that\ntension of a way of living life between being a\ndreamer and a pragmatist? - [Matthew] Yeah. - Which is the better way? - Dude, the honey holds the\nreciprocity of the two of 'em. I mean, I can't be present\nunless I got a plan. I wanna have the big picture in mind, but I gotta go a day at a time. I like to write the headline or I think we need to have a North Star, something to look forward to. But we all know that\nif we're staring at it, we're tripping on the way. You read the Hallmark cards, which irk me, dream it, you can do it. I think that's a half-ass\nhorrible thing to tell somebody. (Lex chuckles)\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And then on the other side, you have things like, people say hope means nothing. Well, yes, it does. That's the dream. You just don't stop there. It's not a period after that word. Now, what do we do practically? And I think that constant tension, when that tension's a dance\nis when it's beautiful, But to see those as contradictions, I think is where it's falling short. One on their own, if we silo the two, well, if you silo the two, I guess the pragmatic's\nthe one to go with, because at least you'll\nget something done. But if you only silo the dream and don't do anything about it, you're kind of living an illusion and kind of living in a virtual reality. - Yeah, it's tricky. Even the people you love can\nsometimes suffocate the dream, can make you believe\nthat it's not possible. It feels like a lot of parents\nkinda want you to be safe, want you to be stable, want you to have a plan so that\neverything's gonna be okay. - [Matthew] Yeah. - And the dream feels\nlike a threat to that. - Yeah. How much of that, though, I\nwonder is proper initiation? Because if you throwing dreams\nout, I call it conservative, very liberal light. Let's learn to block and tackle. Let's learn that work ethic, those things, those pragmatics first, learn the rules of the road, the rules of the game, the things that we can\nall kind of rely on. This is how the world's supposed to work. Now, it doesn't always work that way. You know, you teach a child to drive, it's like, \"Hey, you stay in the lane, you go to speed limit. This is all helpful.\" But that doesn't\nguarantee that no one else is running the red light. But you learn that later. There's an initiation, I think that's proper with the dream. I mean, I think parents, my parents are very much that way. The idea of going to chase an acting career or something was, what? That was a different vernacular. That was like, not in our, I was taught to work our\nway up a company ladder, and, nine to five, do your job. But the day I brought it up and said I wanted to go to film school, and I thought my dad was gonna go, \"You wanna do what, boy?\" He was like, gave me some\nof the best advice ever and told me not to half-ass it. He said, \"Go!\" In between the lines, what he heard from me was that made him so happy\nas a father, I believe, and makes any parent happy, is when our child\ndoesn't ask us permission to go chase a dream. - [Lex] Oh, yeah. - When they're going, I'm bringing it up to\nyou with full respect. - [Lex] Yeah. - But I'm doing this with or without you. That's when a parent goes, \"Ah, yes, I've done something right enough. I helped my child be secure enough in the pragmatics to\nhave a foundation enough where they have the\ncourage to go, (whistling) I'm flying the nest.\" - To take the leap. You wrote, \"After my\ndad died, I had a dream that left me with a statement. Less impressed, more involved.\" - [Matthew] Yeah. - What do those words mean to you? - We gotta be more than\njust happy to be here. I'm big on gratitude, but we gotta be more than\njust thankful to be here. Or dream that you can do it. It's gotta be more than\njust dream you can do it. That's impressed. The dream is still other than and if I'm here, and so impressed with\ntalking to you today, if I have a reverence to an extent, I will not be able to be\ninvolved in this conversation. I'll be too impressed. I'll be anticipating, oh, what's that question he's gonna ask, oh, I think I know he's going with this, oh, I think I know what\nanswer he might love to hear, oh, I'm not involved in conversation. I'm too impressed. So I'm removed from the present. For me, what that literally meant to me, when that came to me in a\ndream and I carved it in, I remember carved it in a tree. It took a couple hours. I still know where that tree is, Santa Monica. My father had moved on,\nhe'd left this life. All of a sudden, it hit me, oh, I don't have the safety net. My dad was above law and above\nreligion to me, he had me. If I really was in the shit,\nif I really needed him, I trusted that he had my back\nabove law, above anything. All of a sudden he's gone. I'm going, okay. It hit me how much I'd been\npretending to be the young man I was trying to be, and not actually putting\nmy ass on the line and have enough courage to take risk and actually own up to the man that he was teaching me to be. And I remember the world got flat. That cloud, that Mr.\nMayor that I saw up there was not way up there. It was, it was fog in front of me now, and let's go into it. I'd say I probably\ngained even more respect for people and things, but I lost a certain amount of reverence that was keeping me from\nfeeling like I'd deserved or I'd earned things or\nlooking out for myself or holding myself to task. And I remember all the things, and I was just going into\nHollywood at the time, so fame was out there\nas one of those clouds, with being an actor and\nall of a sudden celebrity and becoming famous. The reverence I had, I remember it just (whistling) it lowered down to eye level. And I was able to realize it and go, that's not fairy dust. And don't give it so much\ncredit to make it fairy dust. Like, oh, not me. No, I could never, no,\nlook that in the eye with full respect, but less reverence. And at the same time, equidistant, almost equal sublimation. I noticed where I had been\ncondescending people and things, and patronizing and\nput things off as like, less than me and not worthy of my time. (whistling) It raised up to eye level. And so they were all flat in front of me, and the world was flat and I was able to, shoulders went back, my heart\nrose up, my chin lifted up. I looked things in the eye. I became probably less sentimental, hopefully, not to level\nthat I got callous, but I know I became less sentimental. I became more courageous because, when you have someone pass in your life, or maybe it's similar to a situation you're going on in your own\nlife with your homeland, you sober up on these mendacities that we deal with every day, and this bullshit that\nwe give too much credit or too much significance to. And you're like, what am I doing? I'm not even gonna let myself emotionally get brought down or over\nelated by this situation, 'cause it doesn't really\nmatter in the big scheme. And so with certain things\nthat I found reverence for and hesitated from in my life, I was now engaging with, because I was like, oh, it's live. This life is live. Let's look it in the eye\nand go forward through it and deal with the consequences. - What do you make of death? Does it scare you? - I'm not looking forward to\nit, but it does not scare me. - Do you think about it? Do you visualize it? - I do. I do. And it's a beautiful visualization and a beautiful dream when I\ngo as part of the food chain. It's not a good visualization when I go as part of a\nrandom act of violence in a fricking drive-by or something. Because the second, the accident, it breaks a story that I believe\nhas already been written. At least I don't have the capacity yet to put it into a story, a divine story of the lives that we live. And so there's something\nugly and gross about it. And it happens all the time,\nto people all the time. I just feel like when it's\npart of the food chain, when I go as part of the food chain, I'm like, ah, that's poetry. - [Lex] Part of the flow of nature. You return to nature. - Yeah, there's grace and poetry in that. - Do you miss your father? Think about him? - When I think about him, I do. Now, when do I think about him? I thought about him yesterday\nworking through a script I'm working on right now,\nworking on scene work. And I just had that quick little reaction of wanting to show him,\nhey, check the scene. That's right and then I, I don't get sad. I go, \"Yeah, he would've loved this.\" Whereas my mom wants to be on the stage, my dad would've been on the front row. (Matthew and Lex laughing) - He's more fun to show stuff too. - Yeah. He was a character. He knew characters. I've based parts of all kinds\nof characters I've played and the man that I am on\npeople that he introduced me to and who he was. He would've loved the\ncreative process of working on a script or talking about, hey, movie. It's why I always say\nI love the movie \"Mud\" because it's the one that I've visualized and seen my dad come to me so\nmany times as a 12-year-old and put his arm around me and go, \"Hey, little buddy, you see\nthis movie called 'Mud'? Goddamn it, it's a good one. Let's go watch it.\" That, now my dad never got to\nsee me start a career in film, but he was alive five days, he overlapped the first five days of me\nworking on my first film, \"Dazed and Confused\". Now, that I think is, there's something beautiful about that. He didn't never ever come to the set. We didn't talk about it, but he was alive for me to start something\nthat was more than a fad. That was something that would become something that I love to do. And I do miss, not in, you know, and then I go outta that, we talked about him two nights ago with our daughter, I was\nrubbing my daughter's feet. And my mom, who's living\nwith us, she's 91, comes in and goes, \"Oh, look\nat you just like your pop.\" He's like, \"What?\" And he goes, \"Oh.\" 'Cause my dad loved her. Rubbed somebody's feet,\nrubbed my mom's feet, rubbed all of me and my\nbrother's girlfriend's feet. (Lex laughs) When we would have a date. - [Lex] Yeah. - They would come over early because they knew they\nwere gonna get a foot rub. - [Lex] I love it.\n- From Jim McConaughey. And then we'd come out, me\nand my two older brothers, this has been on for decades, we'd come out the shower, ready to go, buttoned up. And they looked like, \"We ain't\ngoing anywhere right now.\" (Lex laughs) And so we told the story to my daughter. And I was like, oh yeah, my dad's his hands, I miss his hands, his hands could heal. - So you carry him in you. - I hope so. I hope so. It's a challenge for me. And I suppose it's like this for any son. How much do we hang on to? And how much do we let go and evolve and update the os and try it maybe better or different? It's that, there's\ncertain things that I know that I fully believe in. It's like, when do we, religious, when do we cast away our father? When do we say no, I'm\ngoing after the dream. I'm not asking your permission. I question that from time to\ntime for myself because I, and it almost feels\nblasphemic, if that's a word, sometimes I feel like what are you doing? You can't check that and go like, well no, I'm not sure if I wanna really. And then I immediately\nkinda let myself off because I believe where he is. He's going, \"Go, buddy.\" - [Lex] Yeah. (laughs) - Go, you're free, man.\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - I'm not gonna hold you back. If you misread that or\nI didn't teach you that as well as maybe I wish I could have. Go, you're free. You're not gonna lose. Trust that you're not gonna lose. It's in your DNA. It's in your lineage, young man. - Still, it's scary to\nnot have a safety net. Losing your father is scary in that way. That you realize this world is just you, in some deep fundamental\nway, it's just you. - [Matthew] Yeah. - You're alone. - Yes. But, oh, I mean also not having that, it's such a gift of\ndeliverance though as well, because I think it's an, I mean, it's an awesome feeling to know, to know we're alone, to\nknow we don't have that, to know you don't have\ntake two or take three, that it's one take. I mean, the peripheral\nvision improves, (chuckles) the link and understanding\nwith our past improves. 'Cause I know for me, I was not ever considerate\nof my past at all, 'cause my dad had that if I needed it. He was my wealth for that. Well, he's gone, like I said, he had the literally\nhad, they have our back. Well, and then when they\nlong or have our back, all of a sudden I'm going like, oh, well, maybe I need to look back and start giving some\ncredit to how I got here, what I'm doing and where I'm heading. It gave me the first time courage to even look over my shoulder. 'Cause again, I didn't have to, 'cause I don't have to look. Dad's got my back. No, dad's gone from this life. He doesn't have your back. Okay. So I mean, I don't know, me, because it's inevitable. I very quickly go to, all right, in the pain, the loss, and yes, even loneliness, which is different from\nbeing alone and loss. Pretty immediately part and\nparcel with the pain, I felt it. - In the pain, you saw the gift, the red light of losing your father. - Pretty immediately, less\nimpressed, more involved. That came like couple weeks after moving on. - Is there a trick to that? To see the gift and the pain? - That's a good question. Is there a trick to it? Not that I know of. I mean, I don't, I have to catch myself from trying to intellectualize\nmy way into the reasoning and not skip over real\nfeelings and discomfort. I mean, I did get that from my mom and I have to watch it that, that so resilient, that we just dust herself\noff and get up and go. - You wanna sit in the feeling. You wanna feel it. You're willing to deeply feel the pain. - I wanna deeply feel it. I wanna look at the\neye and deeply feel it, but I don't wanna wallow in it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Now I was raised where\nyou skip the deeply feel and let's go. And I've said it before,\nbut that will lead to having turned into a person who is a repeat offender\n(chuckles) of the same crimes, 'cause you just get up and you don't, you don't have a winter in your life. You know what I mean? You don't have, there's\nno introspective time. You don't look over your\nshoulder into the past. And so you just get up and you're like, all right, I've stepped in\nthe same pile of whatever a hundred times and I'm fine. I'll do it a hundred first doesn't hurt. Hell, it's good luck. Well, hang on a minute. Maybe we wanna stop and go. What can I learn from that? But I don't know of a trick. I think if there's any trick, I would say, it's just, how quickly can\nwe admit the inevitable? I just wanna talk about in the book back, once you know it's inevitable,\nhow do we get relative? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Not skip it, not throw it to the side, not deny it, which I'd love to talk about that. Here's sometimes too, but the value of denial sometimes- - [Lex] The value of denial.\n- Yeah. But how quickly do we, once something's inevitable, go, (claps) okay, any mind and hard time\nI'm spending about going, no, I can't believe that happened. No, did that really happen? Anytime we spend trying to deny that, what has already happened,\nthat seems to me to be, I'm not sure the value of that time. So if there's any trick, I would say once you know\nsomething's inevitable, even though how painful it\nis or how awesome it is, start getting relative with that. And in the relativity is seeing there's a gift here. And if I realize that gift I'm honoring, now I'm onto building up the beautiful passage of my\nfather leaving this life. Now I'm on the march to go. Yes, let the legacy. Let this become omnipresent. Let him live through me. Let me become more hem. - It's transformed.\n- [Matthew] Yeah. - So what value is there then to denial? Any? - Oh, I think there's value to denial if you really commit to it. (laughs) I get this from my mother. - [Lex] Yeah. (laughs)\n(Matthew laughs) So it's a very pragmatic value. - [Matthew] Whoa!\n- Commit to the denial. - Okay. (Lex laughs) And my mom.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Does it to an extent that I'm like, \"Mom, do you have any consideration (Lex laughs) or context of situations?\" And she does. This is the thing, every time I go, she's not a shallow woman. But if it is something, if it is something happens\nin her life that is keeping her from going\nwhere she wants to go or a joy in her life that she does, she'll straight ass deny\nit happened, didn't happen. No, didn't. Mom, (chuckles) we're right here. I heard you.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - What you said. No, I didn't, you heard something else. Mom? Now does she get some amnesty on that? She's 91. Hell yeah, she gets some amnesty on that, Yeah, does she repeat offend? Yeah, but it's misdemeanors. You know what I mean? I mean, it's like we all, it's part of that thing when\nyou got a family member, you're like, yeah,\nthat's just what they do, just go with it. And it's ingenious in a way. It's a tool, she does. I think it is more of a trick with her. But she wouldn't even so\ningrained her, it's not a trick, it's just (whistles) do it, done. Another reason I bring this up, it's outside of just my mother is, I did this Roadtrip course in this\nArt of Living event a few weeks ago. Out of hundreds of thousands\nof chats that came in and responses that came in afterwards. It seemed to me that about\n80% of people's challenges and problems, even in their life, were something in the past\nthat they were hung up on, that they could not seem to get past. And it was holding them from going where they wanted to in their future. And so I thought that was revealing. I would've thought that was,\nI don't know going in 40%. It was 80, it seemed to be 80%. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then I thought about, okay, if you're here in the live show and you wanna get the course, you're into some sort\nof therapy or education or development or self-help\nor whatever, okay. And I have a lot of friends, and I know a lot of\npeople that are in weekly and daily therapy. And then I know there's a lot of people that are on prescriptions, drugs. And while a therapy and\nthe right prescription to the right person for the\nright diagnosis is necessary. I'm questioning, is there value to going, if you're not getting past this today, this week, this month, this year, all of a sudden a decade goes\nby, and you're still hung up and you can't get rid of that thing. And your memory where we, and it's got you paralyzed and you're a victim of it, and you're doing the therapy, and you're doing the work and you're taking a prescription if that's what you're taking, where does there, is there a value in going? If it's holding you back from\ngoing where you wanna go, maybe you should just deny the fucking thing ever fuckin' happened. - [Lex] Yeah. - Kick it in the head.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Kick it off the curb. I'm done with you. I'm sick of you, I'm tired\nof hanging out with you. I'm tired of that thing, whatever it is, hold me back from going where I wanna go. So if I can't wax the car, you know, and get past this thing, just kick it. - That's so powerful. So one thing to do like with\nthe loss of your father, is to try to transform it,\nto discover the gift in it. The gift and the pain. But if you can't keep\nlooking, keep looking, you can't find the gift and the pain, just deny it ever happened. - You could call that a trick. But I think it's more than a\ntrick because let me say this, my mom, after my father died, went on and found a\nsecond love of her life for 19 years, they were together. CJ Carlick. Love you, buddy. He's moved on now. Did she check with us a little bit? Like is this okay? She gave us a little\nlingering half a second look that we knew that maybe\nwas what she was asking, and we came to her was\nlike, yes, it's okay. And you know who else is saying it's okay, who's dancing up there for you? Dad. So was that her denying that the man she was divorced from twice, and married two, three times, and had three children with, had moved on? No, but she didn't say, I'm not, well, what's the book on how\nlong I'm supposed to say single before I can be interested in another? There's not a book on these things. How do you feel? Is loving CJ mean you love dad less? No. Is finding a new life and a\nnew dance partner in this life, in CJ mean that Dad\nwasn't your dance partner, that dad wasn't the love of your life? No. So I don't know, I mean, in there maybe, maybe there's another\nword, I think it's denial, but it's not really denial 'cause it's not like it didn't happen. That's an earlier example\nI was giving my mom. She will absolutely go, that light's not on. Mom, the light's on. We just, that light's not\non, if I say it's not on, sometimes you're just\nlike, that makes no sense. You're just absolutely\ndenying what just happened. We even have it recorded. - [Lex] Yeah. - And she'll go, well,\nthe recording is lying. - [Lex] Yeah. - I mean, that's part of\na coping deal with her. But I mean, one of\nthings is more important or more valuable is to talk about this. She didn't deny my dad dying. I didn't, but she sure as hell turn the page, and said, I can still\nstart a whole new category, a new life, a new love. Let my heart love and be\nloved by someone living in this life today that\nI'm still living in. And that will not trespass\non my love for my husband, your father, Jim McConaughey. And I think, I mean we were just, thought that was beautiful. Yes, Mom, go, talk about greenlight. Go! Now for a hung up going, can't have one or the can't have 'em both, gotta have one or the other. Now we start to make a contradiction\nof the two ideas again, which darn our contradictions get us in trouble all the time, man. - That's life though. The contradictions, right? - But isn't life, if we just admit the\ncontradictions are so much, don't they become a paradox? We admit that that's part of it. - [Lex] Yeah. - If contradictions are inevitable, hence they do become\na paradox, don't they? Then we're in the honey hall, (Lex chuckles) then we're singing and dancing, and have leniency with ourself while still holding ourself to task. And I think it's holding on\nto know each contradiction. Oh, here it is again. So it's a one-off. It lives on its own. Separate from the last one. No, it doesn't. (chuckles) They're connected, that's\nwhy they are a paradox. And then that's I think that's a much, I think that's where life really is. - In the paradox.\n- [Matthew] Yes. - In the dance of it. I think the metaphor of\nred, yellow, greenlights is just so simple and so powerful. You write about some\n\"Greenlights\" being engineered and some being mystical, which I love the difference of that. What's the difference of\nthe engineered \"Greenlights\" and the mystical? Such a cool word, mystical. - Yeah. Well, the engineered ones have reason and the mystical ones have rhyme. (laughs) - [Lex] Yeah. - Life's a mystery going forward, but it's a science looking back. I prepared, I've had ideas, and written headlines and had goals and athlete gets in shape for an event, and I get in shape for a role. I read, I study, I work, I prepare, and I go and I'm prepared\nand I behave and I do it. And I look at it and I go, yes, that's what I wanted to do. It's engineered, greenlight. It's a conscious delayed gratification. It's that if I do it today, that pragmatic head down, believe there's no cloud out there, but then I trust that\nthere is one out there. If I keep my head down to do it, I'll get that to that dream. We can engineer those habit, work ethic, prep, expertise, education. Now the mystical ones though, don't make any sense. They're not supposed to make sense. They only make sense after, right when they happen, you backlog and you connect the dots with how they got there. That red light you ran into that made you 30 seconds later to get to the restaurant, as you walked in, she walked out, and you went, \"Good morning.\" And she went, \"Good morning.\" (Lex laughs) And-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Two months later, you're dating, two years later, you're married, after that you've got a family. And now you're sitting\nhere 40 years later going, I love you. Look at what we've built. And you go back and go. (Lex laughs) What if I wouldn't hit that red light. - Those 30 seconds.\n- [Matthew] You know. - Made all the difference. - [Matthew] And- - So strange that this life is this way. - Yeah, and that's just rhyme. I mean, we can't really add that up. - Yeah. - It's a science when you look back, you see, you know why it was that you were upset and ticked off that you had to pick up the\nkids' toys before you left, and they were supposed to pick 'em up and therefore, you were late for the thing that maybe you ran into, and you ran into the person\nthat was walking in the office. That's the guy that you did the interview. That's the guy you were looking\nfor, the job you wanted. And you caught him 'cause you\nwere in the elevator with him. And that 90 seconds on\nthat elevator, (claps) that's what got you that job that led to you doing what you wanna do. I mean, the significance is there, but we have to, I think\nwhat we also gotta watch is, again, in that balance, what do we chase? Because we just chased the engineering. We miss magic. If we just chased the mystical, we find ourself caught up\nin trying to give meaning to that Lego set that was on the floor that my kids didn't pick up. And what color was it? And why did I walk out that that door and see almost step on the Legos. But if I'd gone out the other door, I usually go out of,\nI would've gone there. I would've got there early and wouldn't have run into the boss. So you can start to give too\nmuch meaning on that as well. I think we can give\nsignificance in too many places. And all of a sudden, I think we've all been there where you're seeing art\nin every single thing. Oh man, that can be paralyzing. It's like, it's hard to\nleave a room (chuckles) if everything's significant, or if everything's a sign. - How much of success in life\ndo you think is engineered and how much is mystical? And how much does it different\nfrom person to person? Because I, for me\npersonally, maybe I enjoy it, maybe I'm genetically built that way, but I exist more in the mystical, so I don't make plans. I traveled last summer\nin Ukraine with no plan. I just went there. No plan. I didn't know how I'm going to meet the president of the country. I didn't know anybody. And so there's no plan,\nthere's no clear thing. You're just roaming around. And that that's how I've existed in life. There's something about giving yourself over to the flow of\nnature that I just enjoy. It makes life so much fun. - It's awesome when you can do it. Did you engineer though, I'm going to put myself in the place when you got on the plane\nto go to the destination, that was an engineered choice? - Yes, I mean the choice. - With the in intent of, and maybe I'll meet and I'll run into, and I can work up a sit down with, so the engineered choice\nwas putting your shoes on, proverbially get, I always\nsay this the hardest part about going to the gyms,\nputting your shoes on, right? So to getting on the plane, that was an engineered\nthought with the goal in mind, but I don't know how I'm gonna do it. - The choice.\n- [Matthew] Yeah. - Putting the shoes on, yeah. But there's not a clear, it's a fog what happens\nafter the shoe is gone? - Yeah, (chuckles) - [Matthew] yeah, yeah,\nyeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's gonna take that leap. So I wonder how much for people who are\nsuccessful in this world and finding what makes them\ntruly happy and fulfilled, how much of it is engineer? How much is mystical? How much was it for you? - Well, I'll say this\nlike when I went to write about \"Greenlights,\" which is basically the\nlast 40 years of my life, I thought that 85, 90% of my successes were going to be obviously engineered. Or I could see the\nscience, saw the habits, here's what I did. yep, that add up, got the\nsolution, got the conclusion. I was very surprised when I noticed it was probably less than 50%. And that most of the real success of life were when I trusted, when I trusted that I\ndidn't have to define it. That I only trusted,\nthat I didn't have to go, well what's the measurement? What's the score? What lead this leads to what? What's next? For me, that's still a challenge for me daily now is to trust and not be, because I can be, I think I can be overly practical and I think I can over overcompensate and miss out on magic because I'm still going, wait, but do you, are we giving enough the\nmeasure and credit to actuality? Am I giving enough credit to\nthese are the steps to take? And this is reality. I think I'm reminded when I trust, 'cause that\ngoing with the mystic, just to put yourself on\nthe plane was the engineer. But getting there, and as you say you roll in that mystical, that takes a lot of trust. - Yeah. (chuckles) Trust in the inevitable. - [Matthew] Amen on that. - But not knowing where\nit actually ends you up. It's a feeling more than, I don't think it's a clear vision. - [Matthew] Right. - It's kind of like a feeling\nthat guides you towards, towards a place without a clear name, without clear characteristics. It just kind of pulls you there. - Where do you get that courage and trust to go with\nyour gut, your feeling? And is there, for instance, three days later you sit down. It doesn't happen, is there a\nsense a week, two weeks later, now and you come back\nto America that like, \"Ah, I've failed.\" - Sort of looking back to try\nto analyze what went right, what went wrong, that kind of thing. Yeah, that that engine is always there. But I think what pulls me forward in life, what makes me really grateful and fulfilled is noticing\nthe thing you mentioned, noticing the magic and\nkind of going towards it, sort of just sitting back both in tragedy and then triumph. So in war, there's a lot of tragedy, but there's somehow, one of the things you see in war, and this is the first war I've experienced and seen the front is the loss, that people lose their homes, and all this kind of stuff. The thing that rises from that\nis the love for each other. So the people I've spoken with, don't give a about the home. Don't give a about on farms,\non the animals they lost. Don't give a damn about having to move and all this kind of stuff. As long as the family's still there, as long as the people\nthey love are still there. And it's like, there's a melancholy smile\nthey have on their face. Like, yeah, this world\nis full of bullshit, it's full of tragedy, but life is fucking awesome. And you just notice that in little ways everywhere. You just sit back, and\nyeah, notice the magic. And I want more of that and\njust kind of follow along. - [Matthew] Yeah.\n- Like a little ant. - [Matthew] Yeah. - Keep noticing that kind\nof thing, but I don't know. I hope you know what I think it is, is other people notice that\nyou're the kind of person that notices it and they're like, I wanna hang out with that person. He seems all right. Like he seems one of the good ones, one of the good hands. (laughs) - Do you have any certain non-negotiable structure before that freedom to\ngo with the feeling? - I think so. There's such set of principles of just basically integrity\nof being good to other people. Like whatever that means for me, there's specific things\nlike I'm really into loyalty above the law.\n- [Matthew] Right. - There's a kinda like, there's a circle of friends I have and that means everything. There's just a basics deep\nkindness to towards others. Empathy, empathy towards\npeople that other, that others might label as even evil. I have that kind of empathy. I believe all of us have the\ncapacity to do good in evil. And so I just kind of see\neverybody as little babies that grew up in different conditions. And so some do evil, some do good. And there's, yeah, there's\nall kinds of other principles. I love the dynamic between the different humans in their full diversity. I love the dynamic between the masculine and the feminine and\nenjoy it, the dance of it. - Yeah, yeah. So you have a constitution with- (Lex laughs) - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Which you embark. - [Lex] You do too. - Into chasing.\n(Lex laughs) Yes, I hope so. And yeah, for me, I'd like to, it's inspiring to hear\nsomeone like yourself go, I go and I just land and\nI'm just gonna feel it. I can go back and go, yeah. My greatest truths I've crossed, my greatest successes in my life are win. I trusted that and go,\nI took a one way ticket. - [Lex] Amazon, Africa.\n- Africa. Yeah, and those were spiritual and very pragmatic because\nthey led to dealing with succeeding in other ways\nthat are more pragmatic 100%, and gave much more meaning to those things. But that's to be able to go out, and say that's how you, do you have family? - I really wanna get\nmarried and have kids, but I'm not married and\ndon't have kids yet. - [Matthew] Okay. - So actually one of the\nnice things about that is you can take bigger risks. - [Matthew] Yes. - So while I'm not married\nand don't have kids, I feel I owe it to myself to take, just to go, go to the Amazon. - Yes.\n(Lex laughs) Go to that backpack on\nand a one way ticket. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - That does get harder to do. I miss that, sometimes the whim, a song that comes on, you know. - [Lex] Yeah. - Where's that guy from?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Oh, they're from the\nplace that I wanna go, that I dream off, I'll go there. (whistles) One way ticket,\nwhat do I gotta do? Oh, get a couple shot. Okay, go. That was fun. (Lex laughs)\nGotta do this. - Let's get up and go, you're free to. - Yeah. And go, when are you back? When I get there?\n- [Lex] Yeah. - It's a beautiful,\nbeautiful thing. (laughs) - [Lex] Maybe never.\n- Yeah, yeah. - [Lex] You don't know.\n- Yeah. Gosh, you'll be coming\nto visit me (chuckles) in this new place, maybe, yeah. - How did the Amazon, how did\nthe trip there change you? What do you remember of it? Such a magical place. - I've stripped a lot of my past symbols and talismans while I was there. I remember getting there, and just having so much\nadrenaline on the anticipation, anticipation of getting to the Amazon. In the first 10 days, I wasn't really enjoying the trip. I was just charging to\nget to the destination to get to the banks of the\nriver that I had a dream about. And then it just humbled me. I got so fatigued on night, whatever, 12, and was so sick and tired\nof the internal dialogue I was having with myself. I was not enjoying my company (Lex laughs) that I purged and I remember, and stripped off identity markers that I had sort of been hanging onto for like, everything from, what it means to be an American. My dad's ring, him from McConaughey, a meltdown of my mom and dad's class rings from University of Kentucky,\nwere gold from her teeth, and his class ring melted down. Taking that off was really hard to go, I'm casting, am I casting out my father? And I wasn't casting him out, I was just removing to say, I don't have to rely on that\nbeing all of my identity. So to pull that off, to strip down and just to\nwhere I was just a mammal. That next morning, I was light. I got present. I remember writing something down. It was like, all that I\nwant is what I can see and what I can see is in front of me. That sense of not, I\nwasn't leaning around, looking around every corner to get there. And as soon as that hit me, talking about mystical successes\nand realities and truths, as soon as that hit me and\nfor the first time in 12 days, I didn't care about getting there or what was around the corner. Guess what was around\nthe next game corner? The Amazon (chuckles) I mean\nnot around a few corners. The next corner there it was. And that was just like a touche. Those times when the\nprime mover, the universe, God, what we wanna name or believe in, says ding. There you go. That form of detachment from holding on for dear life\nto things in past, so hard, that's not letting the beauty\nthat's right in front of you to feel correctly and\nfollow our intuitions. To have those not cast 'em out. I didn't burn them. I didn't get rid of those things. I just took 'em off and had to\nrecognize, you're still here. You are you, you're much more, that is a talisman. That's a symbol, that means something to you. And that's good, don't\ncast out the meaning. But it's not like when the\nring's off and the hat's off and the crucifixes off\nyour neck that you're like, you're gonna die. (chuckles) And I know those are reminders. Hang on to what they mean\nfor you as we go forward. But as we go forward, quit\nworrying about so much about you. Again, I was looking at\nthe proverbial dream, the cloud so much that I\nwas tripping over myself to get there. And like clockwork, just amazing grace, boom, as soon as it hit me. And I was like, \"Ah, that's it. All I want is what I can see, and all I can see is in front of me. Literally looking down at the ground at what was a sea of 10,000 wild neon blue Amazonian butterflies on the ground. As soon as they fluttered up\nmy head came up with them, I took a few more steps (whistles) and there's the Amazon, that's what you came over here for. Oh, howdy. Those kind of that, truth like that. - Well, the Amazon's interesting too because it really has no past or future losing the moment\n'cause how fast it turns. It just eats up life. It like, if a thing dies it just gets swallowed up 'cause, maybe because of the\nhumidity, because of all that. Because there's so many\nliving creatures that kinda eat each other live on each other. So it really exists in the moment and all this kind of\ndiversity of life there. It's such an interesting place. - Talk about food chain. - Yeah, you're just part of it there. - [Matthew] Yeah. - (chuckles) We humans somehow\nescaped that food chain. But we're still, the\nroots are still there. - I think we're a bit arrogant\nto think we've escaped. (Lex and Matthew laughs) - [Lex] Yeah. - You think I'm being romantic in that notion? - Well, sometimes when\nyou're in a big city, when you're in Austin, Texas,\nand LA you can think like, we're in a car, we're\nin a house, we're safe. But yeah, somehow his nature\nis still a part of us. Our roots are still a part of us. - I think it is more than we realize, more than we give a credit for. I actually, I believe that we, that it's a really arrogant\nnotion to think that we are separate. Meaning people talk about, pollution, a larger scale that the climate or what have you. I think Earth's gonna be just fine. - [Lex] Yeah. - We may be not be here for it, but I think we have a bit of\narrogance sometimes to think that we can tramp mother nature. I think we have more of\nthe natural law in us and I sure hope so if I'm wrong. - Well, there's an interesting,\nI've recently been, there's a guy named Max Tegmark at MIT, who really worries about nuclear war. And he was part of\nconstructing a simulation of what happens when\na nuclear war happens. And it's interesting to see that, some very large percentage\nof humans on Earth starved to death because they don't die\nfirst from the explosion. They die from starvation 'cause basically dust covers the entire North\nAmerica and entirety of Europe. And so the crops all die, all the food sources all die and people suffocate and starved to death. But you know the lesson\nyou'll learn from that over a period of a few months, even though most of the human\npopulation of Earth dies. Earth finds a way, life finds a way. - [Matthew] Yeah.\n- To adapt. And it's gonna be just fine. - [Matthew] Yeah. - In terms of the big living ecosystem that is life on Earth. And yeah, it's humbling to think about, well, maybe we're just a stepping stone. Same thing with talked offline about artificial intelligence. Maybe humans are just a stepping stone to the development of these other super intelligent entities. - Yeah. Yeah. And is it unconsciously in our\nnature that that's just part of the evolution and\nadaptation of our species because we're gonna, we were talking about it earlier, what AI becomes. It is completely 100% based on who we are. - And we get to see it for some time a mirror to ourselves. Okay, this is what human\ncivilization is like. These AI systems, large language models are\ntrained on human communication. And you get to ask it questions and you get to have conversations with it. And you get to realize, wow, this is what the collective intelligence\nof the human species are collective wisdom and knowledge. This is what it looks like. All the bias, the hate, the\nparadoxes, all that is in there. - [Matthew] Yeah. - The contradictions. You can even convince those models. You can tell 'em they're lying and they're gonna start changing- - [Matthew] Yeah.\n- Their mind. It's interesting to play with them. - [Matthew] Yeah. - It's also interesting\nto consider that maybe they become smarter than us and become of almost life\nforms that live among us and maybe one day kind\nof we merge with them. There's all kinds of possible trajectories that we take here. - How much of that excites you? How much of it scares you? - Is it possible to exist in a place where it is both exciting and scary, but to exist in that dance? Mostly I'm really excited because I see human\nbeings as deeply lonely. Like there's a deep\nloneliness in all of us. That's how we see connection. That's why we see connection in others. That's why love is so beautiful when we find other people\nwe're connected with. And I just think AI can add to that. You can add friends that you can have great conversations with and that some of those\nfriends would be AI systems. (chuckles) They'll call you out bullshit and you're in the most fascinating\nand interesting of ways and challenge you and help\nyou explore ideas together. So I'm excited by that. - Is that different? And if so, how from the internet and Facebooks and these groups and\ncommunities that were, I think it's fair to say, set out to say this all access\nof information to people will help us find more common denominators than divisive ones. Do you see similar? - Yeah, it's similar but\nfurther into that direction. I think the internet has\ndone an amazing thing in connecting us and expanding our minds and helping us find community that feels like our community and then communities that\nare totally different and you learn from them. I mean Wikipedia alone, one\nof my favorite websites, - [Matthew] Mine too. - Opens your mind to\nall kinds of cool stuff. - Yeah, it does.\n- [Lex] And it's- - Not to do system anymore. - (laughs) No. And so I think AI just\nmakes that even easier. 'Cause Wikipedia have to like read and have to do a lot of work. Within AI system like a\nlarger language model. You can just shoot the shit. It's more like drinking a beer\nversus like doing homework. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's already happening. What do you think about that becoming the new family to where you said you're not married,\nyou don't have kids. Could you see a future for yourself or do you have a relationship with AI and that is your family? - That's the main, that's the primary, like even romantic relationship. - [Matthew] Yeah. - I can see it, that one worries me. I like to keep it at friends. - Right. (Lex and Matthew laughs) - I think I'm not ready\nto commit to the romantic. (Matthew laughs) I wonder how much that\nnow that takes us back to the Amazon in nature, how much we still need the human touch. - [Matthew] Yeah. - And whatever magic there\nis between two humans, which takes the leap into the romantic versus just the intimacy of a\ngood friendship, I don't know. - So correct me if I'm wrong, you see AI as having a deep\nand meaningful friendship. - [Lex] Yeah. - And hopefully it will be a friend that will help you evolve and be able to love\neven more and be loved. And you can take that into humanity and find another homosapien?\n- [Lex] Yes. - To go, yes. And thank you AI, my great friend for opening me up to this\nbeauty that I have myself, and I can see in you, my fellow human. And let's come together and biologically create\nfamily if we want to. And let's all remain\nfriends with my friend and make your own friends with\nmy friend's friends on AI. And let's have these great neighbor. It's a good friend, that great friend that's a neighbor. - Yeah, yeah, mentor and friend. Just like now there's AI\nsystems that play chess far, far, far better than humans. And we humans still play\nchess with each other. Chess is still a game\nthat's fun for us humans. - [Matthew] Right. - And then we use AI systems\nto get better at chess, to learn, to train, to discover new ideas, but ultimately return to the\nchess board between two humans. But, of course, this world\nis full of dangerous people. And so those same AI systems can be used to harm, to create false narratives, to do social engineering\nand manipulate the masses in terms of what they believe\nand all that kind of stuff. And that's scary. - Yeah. Well, and I get it. And I have my own fear and distrusts of AI is based on my own fear and\ndistrust of myself and others. There's something, it's very simple, but I think it's a really done sort of way to just set up this reality and everyone, it's kind of a duh, but still needs to be\nsaid that AI is a prompt. It doesn't do anything unless we ask it. So what questions-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Are we gonna ask is a question is what\nwe need to ask ourselves 'cause we're going to\nbe looking in the mirror at our digital God that\nwe create from ourselves. And just to know that that's place where it's awesome and\nscary, exciting and scary. Where you go, oh, it's our creation, which is awesome at the same time. Oh, shit. But it's prompted by our questions and gives us patterns from\nthat which we give it. - But that prompting, that's the art of life. Like we prompt each other in\nconversation, our loved ones. When you go out about your day today, the next words you say, the\nnext word you say to me, the question I ask of\nyou that's prompting. - [Matthew] Yeah. - (chuckles) And it\ncould change everything. I could say so many things right now that will completely just the set of possibilities where both of our lives can take given on the selection of\nwords I use and you use, it's crazy. Makes conversation, pun.\n- [Matthew] Yeah. - And then same thing with AI, except the nice thing\nabout AI is it's tireless. - Tireless, right. Let me ask you this. If you can falsely condemn me right now, and I prove you falsely condemn me, I can forgive you and we can march forward\nstronger than before. - [Lex] Yes. - In AI's tireless and retention. Can it forgive? I mean, can it go, oh, oh, okay. Yep, sorry about that one, that was wrong. Can it amend?\n- Yes. Yeah, you could prompt\nit to ask for forgiveness and it'll forgive you. - Well, like when I\ntalk it around with it, and you ask, what should\nI be afraid of with you? Or what's the dooms toward you? Its answer was always,\nwell, it's up to you. (Matthew and Lex laughs) Which she was awesome, right?\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - There we go, again, it's up to us. And it brought up, make me synonymous with\nyour human values and ethics and responsibilities, but it doesn't deal that\nI didn't find anyway, deal with defining or\nmaking choices on its own of what those are. - Yeah, I think some of that is manually, those are constraints put on by it, by the creators of those\nlarge language models. Basically, not letting the systems have an identity of their own. And some of it is just\nnot engineered in yet. But I believe that we'll have\nsystems that have an identity, have a belief, have a set of opinions that carry through time. - And will we go to\nthem like certain states where we agree with the law and disagree with the law or nations. And I'm a member of this AI, oh, well you're from this AI tribe, y'all believe this. - Yeah, there'll be an\nanarchist set of AIs. There'll be the communists,\nthere'll be the Nazis, there'll be the Democrats\nand the Republicans. There'll be the people\nwho are in the keto diet and the people that are in\nthis other kind of diet, this other kind of lifestyle. Just like we have now. There's little groups and\nthere'll be AI systems there. - They're gonna be supercharged. - Yeah. They'll be either the\nleaders or the foundation on which we build those groups. It'll be the possibility of all the fun we can have is endless. Of course, the dangers\nalways rise up there because I mentioned the Nazis, I mentioned all the dangerous ideas. The set of ideas that\nhumans have come up with. A lot of them are awesome,\nmost of them are awesome, I would say. But some of them are dangerous. The reason they're dangerous\nis because they become viral. There's something exciting\nin us about those ideas, but they also harm others a lot, 'cause that's who we are as humans. We're capable of envy and\nall the dark stuff of hate and all this. - Capable, yes. We also choose it. - Do you think most people are good? - Yes, but I also believe we got the good and evil in all of us and it's which wolf we feeding. - You ask people to draw\na distinction to describe where are you acting\nand where are you being? What's the difference? What's the difference between being fake, I mean, use that word in being real. - Okay. Yeah, and the word authentic\ngets thrown around a lot. I don't mean, I used to think, I used to feel this way, but Bob Dylan loosen me up\non this idea a little bit. (Lex and Matthew laughs) You think it was all about get to be the, your only one and only true self. - [Lex] Yeah. - That's it. Everything else is fake. And then you hear Bob go, well, I mean, we are what\nwe create ourselves to be. We are our own creations, which I'm like, oh yes, yes, we are. Thank you Bob, Bobby. I'm all for bullshitters and bullshitting, I'm not as big a fan\nof the liars and lying. - What's the distinction? You're talking about the\nart form of bullshit? - A liar's faking it, but not admitting to\nthemselves that, yeah. - [Lex] Oh, yeah. - It's fucking creation, I'm faking it. A liar, I'm lying to your face right now. And I don't give you that hair of a wink out of my right eye that let you know, \"Hey, go with me here.\"\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. (laughs) - I think there's value\nin the bullshitting. - [Lex] Yeah. - Now the lying becomes troublesome because one, I've duped you\nand I didn't let you know, come on, I was just telling the story about catching the fish. The fish always gets bigger\nevery year we tell a story. Come on, go it, all right? - [Lex] Yeah.\n(Lex laughs) - But the lying all of a sudden, I don't know my own, I don't know when I'm emanating something and creating something, telling the truth, being authentic or lying, and all of a sudden I'm\nleaving crumbs with myself. That constitution gets blurry. - Lying to yourself and to others. - Yeah, well, you start\nto lie, you lie to others, and that you start to lie to yourself and you don't even know it. And that, I believe is\ndangerous territory. That's why I'm trying to push this admit because that goes, I'm not to, I'm trying to come in\nat a kindergarten level because we immediately jumped to, well, I'm a judge that, boom, that's bad, that's wrong. No, no, no, no, no. (whistles) Hold back on that. Let's go back to base level of, let's just admit that\nwe all fucking do it. Lies we tell others, lies we tell ourselves, lies we believe for convenience sake. I do it, I'm guilty of it. I try to catch myself on it. If I can just call it and go, you know, you're believing\nthat lie out of convenience. I'm like, I know. And then I have to, either\nI'm saying that in the mirror or writing it down or\nsharing with a friend. And I go, okay, well now I've inherently\nbecome a bullshitter then, because I admitted it. That I can shake hands with, that's the little slight wink to ourself and someone else go, come on, it's a better story this way. - In the course Roadtrip, you start with step one, admit. How do you do that? How do you kinda step back and- - Do that inventory? - Yeah. Is there a trick to that? - Oh, if there's a trick to it. I think it's just about\ncourage of having the, 'cause it's, I don't think any of us like to admit our lies or look deep enough in the go. I've relied so much on that lie\nthat it's become my reality. - [Lex] Yeah. - I don't wanna be so puritanical, as I say, again, that's why I\nsay admit, instead of judge. But I don't wanna be so\npuritanical I should go, and admit it and get rid of it. No, I'm just saying to admit it, just bring it to the surface. Ah, yeah, I'm saying this and I'm\ndoing something different. I preach this, but I actually, my actions, just admit it. Just admit 'em. I think that's the first\nstep to where we begin to either forgive ourself and\ngive ourselves some amnesty and go, yeah, I'm a human. Trying to make it through\nlife as best I can. I'm gonna let myself\nslide on that one, okay? And maybe I've been getting\naway with it for so long. Whole family, my whole network\nworks well on it, okay? (laughs) Forget this. Get to the base of the\ntruth of the matter. But just admit it. And then it will also help, it'll be easier to then\nexpose to ourselves, which one do we go? No, I'm not letting myself\nslide on that one anymore. That is actually a lie I've been believing that's been keeping me from getting more of what I want in life. That's actually a lie I've been living that\nI haven't admitted that is not allowing me to enjoy life as much as I damn well should be, deserved to be, or I've earned to be. Or just sort of let myself, excuse me, I had on a, so it's not all the hard stuff. Sometimes it can be a fun thing. I'm talk about, how many times\ndo we major in our minors, let's admit where we sit there and we go, all right, I give myself 12 hour workday, but I notice I'm spending\neight on my hobbies and four on my career, while\nI'm majoring in my minors. Ah, well me admit that. There's the math. Why don't we invert that? How about four hours on my\nhobbies and eight on my career? First off, just admitting\nit allows me to go, well, now I can do the math or rearrange the math by time of day. But I look, I just found a hobby, tennis. First hobby I've had in 25 years. I had to admit that I went to play tennis, I start to love it for the first month, I started feeling guilty. I was like, I'm having, is it\nokay to have this much fun? (Lex laughs) I'm having so much fun-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And I'm getting a great workout. And I just admit, I was\nlike, yes, it's okay. Congratulations. Well, he found something\nthat you're finding quite pleasurable, for straight pleasure. You don't have to, forget\nall this other stuff, but yeah, but I'm also getting a workout. We ain't getting that too. But don't just, you don't have to excuse\nthe pleasure based on, oh, but it's good for you, and no, you, damn it, the real reason you love is 'cause you're having\nso much damn fun at it. I had to admit that to let myself go, damn right, I'm going to play tennis\nagain today or tomorrow. It was a simple fun thing. So it's not always\nabout the hardcore stuff that we have to go. This is a deep dark lie\nthat I'm been living by, and it's having me live falsey and it's having harmful\nconsequences on my loved ones. Some of those will probably\narise when we admit. I think he's just having looking\naround and it just saying. And when we admit it, then we go. When we admit a lie, then we become something\nmuch more valuable. A bullshitter. Yeah.\n(Lex laughs) - You had the little wink in your eye. I love the distinction. - I'm bullshitting myself on\nthat thing, yep, I'm lying. Therefore, if I caught in a lie. Yep, well now, yep, I'm bullshitting. Now just out, didn't judge it. But now I'm bullshitting, that I think we can work with. - Well, you're an interesting case study because you're one of the most famous, one of the most charismatic, successful humans in the world. There's a lot, millions\nof people love you. Hang on every one of your words. That's a hard place to be. How do you call yourself? How do you admit that you've been living a lie? How do you admit yourself in big ways and small ways on lies at this point, given how many people love\nyou, how famous you are? - 10 years ago? I don't know. I don't know. Someone was talking about like, yeah, they really admire\nthis so and so person 'cause they're not someone\nwho looks in the mirror. And I was like, yeah. And all of a sudden I was like, man, I gotta catch myself\nlook in the mirror a lot. (Lex and Matthew laughs) And then I go in, and I look at my wife's\nside of her bathroom, how many different creams\nand stuff she has out there. Look at my side, I got\na lot more on my side. I'm like, oh, I notice how if I'm out and public working out, maybe doing pushups and\nmaybe I'd do a few more. If there's a group of people walking by that maybe I'd like to impress, then maybe I do a few more\nthan I'd do if I was on my own. I'm like, you are vain McConaughey. (Lex and Matthew laughs) - [Lex] Yeah. - And the knee jerk is, oh, vanity bad. And all of a sudden I was like, all of a sudden I became a bullshitter. Once I admitted and vain, I was like, well bravo vanity. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Let's go vanity. Instead of putting it in the cupboard, in the lie section. Oh, I'm in a vain, 'cause that's a debit. No. Admit it. And then go, what's the value in it? Well, I can look at, yeah, I've actually got in better\nshape because of my vanity. Actually, I eat better. I'm better that morning, and that led to being a\nbetter husband, better dad, doing something with my kids when I'd rather be over there writing this work I'm working on. But I know that tomorrow, 'cause when they leave town, they're gonna remember this\ntime that we had together here. That's a selfish act to go\nspend that time with my kids or my wife, even though I'd rather not\nbe doing it at that time, I'd rather be doing something for myself. Because when they leave tomorrow they'll have this great memory that they spent with their\ndad right before they went, that I could call that vanity. (chuckles) I could group that and say,\nthat was a very vain of you. That was for our self. Yeah. 'Cause it was also for something and someone that I cared about. - Are there people in your life that call you all in your bullshit? In the bad sense of the word, bullshit? - Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes it's either I got\na pretty thick threshold for how far I can go with my bullshit. Like what bruise, what tickles me might\nbruise others to watch it. - (chuckles) That's a good line. (laughs) Yeah. Tickles me might bruise others. - But I also, I go back and talk about the bullshit, that's over there with\nthose mystical successes. It's the, yeah, no, don't go with it. Don't pull a parachute yet. Let's see how far we can go. Let's see how hot it can get. Let's try it one more time. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Yes, two more please. - [Lex] Yeah. - That's where a lot of\ngreat pleasure and stories and successes will come from. Those are mystical, they don't add up. It's like we're not talking\nabout reason right now. We're not talking logic,\njust go with this. Let's talk about the virtual (chuckles) and making it real. - The old line of fake\nit till you make it. I mean, what is that? There's something to that. - There's definitely something to it. But I would, where people would go fake it, I would go back to Dylan's or create it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Recreate it, create and recreate it. You know, till it becomes, till you make it. So I'll have people call my bullshit, and a lot of times they're right. I think when I handle\nit the most healthy way is I admit yes, and I'm aware, and I'm going to keep going. - So you're not like resisting and denying and putting it away.\n- Oh, I will. I will, and I have to\nwatch that where I'm like, no, I'm not. That's not what I'm doing. And usually when it's\ncoming from people that are, there going, no, you are, it's like, I won't admit it.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And then that's where I'm telling a lie and that'll come up, get me later. I'll go, I didn't see it. I didn't see I was doing that. I was either unaware, I\nwouldn't let myself be aware. I was denying that I was doing that. - What would you say that's ego? Has ego been bad or good for you? - Gosh, I think it's been, I'm so thankful for ego. Does it get off the\nbridal for me sometimes and run loose and run places and where it's not of service (chuckles) to others and has it hurt loved\nones and even strangers? Yes. But I also, when my ego's really strong, it's in sync with serving, it's in sync with where I serve myself, also serve as others, serves others. It's those two are part and parcel. They're intertwined. And that's the capital E, ego, that I think and hope we all need more of, and that's what I mean\nby talking about selfish, that's redefining that the\nreal true meaning of that is not doing something for self at expense of your\nneighbor or harming others. It's for personal profit and pleasure, that also is profit and pleasure\nfor a utilitarian sense, more of others. And there's a again, back to the paradox. I think there's a place, I know there's a place, I believe there's a place\nwhere those are in sync. And when my ego's healthy, I'm able to say I'm sorry sooner for a lie or a misdemeanor or harming somebody. I'm able to be more empathetic because I got the confidence.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - To be so. I'm able to be more humble. But still have my chin\nhigh and my heart high and look in the eye and go, yep, my bad. Bogie, guilty. I shank that one outta bound, man. - That's beautifully put. So ego can be constructive,\nnot destructive. You won an Oscar for your performance in \"Dallas Buyers Club.\" Can you tell the story of becoming that character Ron Woodruff? What was the toughest part? - Toughest part, which was the most enlightening part was getting to know who he\nwas in between the lines. We're based on a life story\nin an hour and a half of film, and script is great. But who was he in between the lines? Who was he before he started a business, before he was on a crusade, before he went to alternative medicines? The obvious thing people\nalways talk about, well how'd you lose all that weight? That was not hard. That was just a militaristic decision. This is what I can eat each day and if I do this each day for a week, I'll lose 2.5 pounds in a week. So I'm gonna give myself\nfive months to do that. 2.5 times as 10. There you go, there's 47 pounds. That was like clockwork. So that was easy, that decision was made. I didn't go to the Pizza\nHut buffet (chuckles) and have temptation in front of me. I had certain meals. I ate that, and the weight\njust went off like clockwork. It was the who is Ron\nWoodruff in between the lines and the gift I got given that gave me the insight\nto who that man was, was his, I went to see his family, and as I was leaving his family offered me his diary. And I remember it kind\nof hesitant going, wow. Yes, but I kind of hesitated 'cause it felt maybe a little too intimate\nof a thing for me to have. It felt like it was kind\nof maybe infringing a bit. But I opened my hand and took it. And what I got in the diary\nwas I got to know who Ron was before he had HIV, and little thing, the diary he'd write in and the dreamer he was. And then the getting all\nset on a Sunday night and laying his shirt out and ironing it for the next morning, making sure little pager\nhad fresh batteries in it, 'cause tomorrow morning\nhe was going across town to hook up some speakers for 38 bucks or whatever. And then getting up that morning and writing about what\nkind of coffee he drank and how much gas it was gonna\ntake to get over across town to do that job and hook up those speakers. And then on the way over, Paige coming in to say,\nno, we don't need you. We've gone with somebody\nelse to hook 'em up. And here, he was all buttoned up. Two cups of coffee in, hair slicked over, shirt ironed. Little less than half a tank of gas, but enough to get back home. Now where's this Monday go? - The hope and the disappointment. You have to take all that in. That's part of that man. - I'm just gonna go to Sonic and get a double cheese bacon burger 'cause Sheila over there,\nman, she's kind of cute. She always gives me high price on it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Which leads to rolling the joint, hanging out till Sheila gets off the work, sneaking over to the local motel\nand shagging up in room 16. That's my lucky number 16, Sheila! (Lex laughs) Then wandering out that night, getting home at one in the\nmorning, no plans for Tuesday and maybe later in the week think about what am I\ngonna do about work or job. And these little dreams would\nget me peak and want to, and then something would happen where he wouldn't follow through\nor the deal would go down, the deal would go south. In there was where I saw who, he was a dreamer, and he just couldn't catch the break and didn't follow through. And then I remembered\nhis family said like, \"Oh yeah, he invented it. He got patents on a whole bunch of things but he never would.\" He had things to get patented but never would follow through\nto get the government patent. And then later on, you'd\nsee the product be made or sold on QVCs or something. They'd be like, \"Ron, that was yours. They stole your idea,\ndid you patent that?\" He'd be like, \"No.\" Like never would that, there's something beautiful\nand sad about that. - [Lex] Yeah. - That let me inside\nwho he was in his heart and who he wanted to be and what he was hoping\nto be and trying to be, who couldn't quite pull off. - When you go that deep, this is a part of him staying you forever. Are you able to let go? - I mean I hope so. Look, there's a tenacity to survive that I got from him. Look, hopefully I can\ntry and find some of that in different ways in any character that I go play, 'cause that's, if you really wanna give\na character an obstacle to overcome, a need, I mean the base one is life and death. Whether that's the need to survive or the need to stave off extinction. I'm not talking about what\nthe rules, the laws are, the social morays, the manners and graces. I'm fighting, you're gonna fight for your own life in a world that's not\nsupporting you to do so. You, there's a wonderful\ncourage of fuck it. Watch this. What do I got to lose? My life or I'm in charge of extending it? Get outta the way, and I'll pick your pocket\nalong, whatever it takes. So there's a tenacity to live\nby whatever means necessary to survive that I that I'm reminded of, that I learned from Ron. - So on that line of survival\nbetween life and death, you starred in \"True Detective,\" which I think explores some\ndarker aspects of human nature. What did you take from that, from that role from that experience,\nphilosophically, psychologically? - The freedom of being on an island. He was such a singular character\nand of a singular mind. And as you know, it wasn't a dance party\nup there in his mind, (chuckles) it was some some heavy stuff, but also existentially\nfor him always like, death would be a deliverance for him. It'd also be a cop out in a way. It'd also would be, he was not a man who was\ngonna give himself amnesty and didn't allow it from\nthe rest of the world. Wouldn't give himself an out and while living in his head\nand heart and spirit was whew, more of a hell than arguably dying. There was no alternative. That's not negotiable for that man. And that's why he was such a, that's why he was the\nbest detective that ever walked the Earth. That's why he was such\na superhero in a way to have that singular. You don't go, oh, I wish I was him. No, but you'd like,\nwow, that constitution, that clarity of identity. Talk about a measure in a man's constitution. He didn't allow anybody off\nthe hook, especially himself. You wanted him to forgive a little bit or give himself a little amnesty. You wanted him to like, \"Man, it's Saturday bro,\ncan you go on a date?\" (Lex laughs) You wanted him to like, enjoy something. But he was connected to\nsomething in his DNA, who he was and something much more baseline truth. And that's why he was\nsuch a good detective. So that, but there's an island, as much as that company can be. I said earlier on that Amazon trip, but it wouldn't join the company. There's parts I think that\nI maybe gave to myself to Rustin Cohle, and also that Rustin\nCohle's given back to me, that are like, yeah, when\nyou wanna pull the parachute, 'cause you can't stand the company that you're in McConaughey\nin your own mind, the Socratic dialogue is\ndriving you freaking crazy. Don't pull a parachute, stick with it. Go through it. - So you were able to walk around with that tormented mind of his- - Tormented. I didn't have very much\npatience for mendacious talk. I didn't have as much\npatience for small talk. I wasn't tormented. - But the character was\nand you have to embody him. So is that, I mean, does\nsome of that bleed over? Are you able to separate the\nman you are from the character? - Look, am I able to separate? Yeah, I came home to my kids and when they walk around the door and greet me and go, what'd you do today? And you got three kids under 10 years old, you don't tell 'em about the scene where you help someone\ncommit suicide. (laughs) It's just, hey, you\nturn it into a parable. And actually, I've always said this, having kids has made me a better actor and a better storyteller because I have to parabolize\n(Lex laughs) certain things, and tell it in ways that I go, oh, neat. Did I bring it home? I didn't bring torment. Did I bring introspection into my own? This characters for me, and I think this is true for\na lot of actors and actresses, it's not a separation. We each have everyone else in us. It's just seeing, diving\ninto Rustin Cohle, knowing where his mind and heart is from the hand of Nic Pizzolatto, who wrote the character\nand wrote the whole series. Understanding number one,\nwhat the hell am I saying? What's he talking about? Then going deeper into that, well, if that this person\nreally believes that, what does that say about how they move? Then I'm going, all of a sudden, well, who is that in me? What part of my left\nbrain is locked into that? What part of my reptilian brain is whoosh latched onto that, this other stuff is non-negotiable. Then I just live in that, and I always taught like a '70s equalizer. Remember the old Marantz equalizers, and you move up your 500\nHkz, you move up your 60, you just rebalanced equalizer and we all have. So it's just going to those parts of me where I'll turn up the volume, some parts of the base with\nthe treble on the equalizer and turn down other parts of myself. And I'm not coming home\ntormented as Rustin Cohle. Am I coming home seeing torment where it should be seen? Am I reading the news differently? Are things coming out of\nthe news and catching my eye as being bullshit or lies or\ntruth that it's just hard? And going, yep. Yeah, I'm seeing it\nthrough a different lens, but I'm seeing my own life\nthrough a different lens. A lens that was opened up and an aperture that was opened up through Rustin Cohle - You mean the process of\nbeing an actor, an actress, I guess is a really interesting way to be a philosopher of human nature. - Yeah, I mean it's an incredible-\n- [Lex] really in it. - Dive into the humanities\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And all the analogies.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - And philosophy. And as I said, as I opened up that question like that, being on an island is a vacation. I am also conscious for five months when I'm playing Rustin Cohle that, this is an interesting fact. I was as strong spiritually\nwith my relationship with God when I did \"True Detective\"\nas I've ever been. - Why is that? (laughs) - Okay, which you would\nsay, wait a minute, in some ways those are antonyms were, no, but my, I pretty safely can say\nthat my own strength of spirit in my own personal life, Matthew's life there, gave me the confidence to go further away, deeper into the torture\nand deeper into the, but it was still, he was still\nalways going after truth. That was the thing. He was not an evil man. I don't even know if you\ncan call him a nonbeliever, but he was always going after the truth and the truth burned. And he would take the scar\nand get burned for it. He'd die for it. That something was actually\nbiblical about that. (lex laughs) And so-\n- [Lex] Yeah. - I don't think it's\ncoincidence that I was, had so much sort of diving into the depths of that tortured character because I trusted that when I go out, I'll come up the other side. It's always like jumping\nin a pool of water and can you trust you'll\ncome up the other side and not, you go play a criminal, you trust you're not gonna come out the other side of tyrant in real life. You just go, ah, God, I got to go do that. Came out and I'm still alive, got all my faculties, I'm not in jail, whatever it is. And so my own spirituality\nat that time at hell, it definitely, I think\ngave me a certain trust and confidence to go\nfurther into the dark. - It was announced that you'll be starring in a \"Yellowstone\" spinoff show. What do you think about the cowboy ethos that permeates \"Yellowstone\" and other shows created\nby Taylor Sheridan, (Matthew laughs) your a Texan? - I'm a Texan. Yeah. - What do you think about\nthat like philosophy and way of life? - I admire the simplicity of it. I mean, one bit, one way you could explain \"Yellowstone\" and Costner's role is what will man do to\nprotect land and family? - [Lex] Yeah. - In a world that's trying to encroach, in a world where there's a cowboy ethos that deems trespassing\nmore clear, earlier. - Yeah. (chuckles) - [Matthew] Than men-\n- Yeah. - Than other, other hats. I admire that simplicity\nof right and wrong. - And the simplicity\nof that right and wrong doesn't always correlate,\ncoincide with the law. - No, it's above the law. You mentioned something earlier, I don't remember where it\nwas in the conversation, but it's a little bit of like, okay, if the law ain't\nhandling this, I am. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then it is, the law's not gonna handle this, therefore I am, and then it is, I'm handling this. Law, talk to them when you get to them, I'm handling this going forward. - There's honesty to that. It just seems, of course, it's dangerous\nbecause it's a slippery slope. Because of the power\nin that power corrupts, it can be a slippery slope where you completely disregard the law and you can hurt a lot of people. But when done right, there feels to be\nsomething really authentic and human about that, protect family, protect land above all else. - Yeah. Look, this is a broader question, but I'm gonna piggyback it off of this back to the dreams in reality\nand then the evolved species and what can we do in\ncreating a digital God and AI, and these communities and\nfriends that challenge us and think like us, we\nlike to hang out with, do you think we're a less evolved species than we give ourself credit for? Do you think we give ourself credit for being more involved than we actually are? - [Lex] I think we do. - I do. I think we need to admit that. - I think probably the cowboy ethos is a stepping towards admitting that. And that's why it's so appealing to people and kind of wakes them up\nto realize that we are, we're not so far from our ancestors that the values of loyalty\nare really important. Trust on the basic human level. How do you know if you can trust someone? - I don't know if I can trust someone. Well, I don't know a trick to it. I do not know a trick to it. But I do come in as I believe you do with high trust. I come in with a, I'm told sometimes I think I'm told that I trust too much sometimes. - Have you been hurt? Have you been betrayed? And if you have has that like- - [Matthew] Yeah. - Hurt your willingness to trust. - No, it hurt. And I put that person and those people in\nanother category back here, and do my best not to let them know that it bothered me at all, but I know when I'm with those people. - By a new person, you're\nstill willing to go through? - No, I'm not gonna do that. I think that's the beginning of cynicism, which I think is a horrible\ndisease of getting older. I'm not gonna do that. - So you're fighting cynicism\noff as much as you can. - No kidding, no way.\n- [Lex] I love it. - No way, no way.\n(Lex laughs) And there's no residual in it. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- There's no win. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It's easy, it's clever. Gets the laugh at the party. And if it sleeps well, it shouldn't be. - (chuckles) Don't get\ncomfortable in the cynicism. I have to ask you about being a Texan. You're like, when I think Texas, I think (laughs) Matthew McConaughey, what's it mean to be a Texan to you? I've recently moved to Austin,\nTexas some two years in. - All right.\n(Lex laughs) All right, welcome.\n(Lex laughs) - What's it mean to be a Texan? Educate us. - Texas is about independence. Politically, Texas is not\nabout Republican or Democrat. It's about independence. Independence of spirit, sovereignty. Texas is about exploration. One of the things I love about Texas is, I run into so many\nTexans around the world. Texans are taught to go, be tech, conservative area, learn who we are, then go. Go explore, pioneer, journey, and hopefully you come on back with some goods and some stories, (Lex laughs) you Texan.\n(Lex laughs) - And underneath that is\nthis kind of freedom of being an individual in the\nfull meaning of that word. - Yeah, well, Texas is\nliberal on your entrance. (Lex laughs) Very liberal on your entrance. Less regulation. Hey, welcome. High trust. High trust, sir. Welcome to our state. Come on in. Yes, yes, yes. But if you lie, cheat, steal. - [Lex] Yeah. - We're conservative on our consequences. (Lex laughs) - Oh yeah, that's a good line. You've briefly pondered\nrunning for governor. I don't know if that's in\nyour future, I hope it is. You had a few good lines about it. Do you think about that kind of stuff, about what the future holds in terms of- - [Matthew] Yes.\n- Political office. - I don't think about it in\nterms of political office. I've graduated to a broader, larger thought of what's\nmy future hold and where, would I be most useful as a leader. I think that's a fair word. Whether that's thought, whether that's the leader\nof my family right now as a parent, as a father. A leader of, people that work with me, politics is, I'm not gonna say it's, 'cause it's not small and I'm not, that's why I say that\nout loud, it's not small. I do think it needs to re-engineer and redefine what its purpose is before, because it's just chasing\nits own tail right now with the two parties that are seem to me to be completely about just invalidation of the opposition instead of vision of themselves. So I think it needs\nredefinition of what it is, because it is important. That's why I mean, that's why I said I don't mean small, it needs to think bigger about what it is and how it's useful. - When it seeks to invalidate it's small, when it seeks vision, it can be big. - Yes, well, one's affirmative, one's going into that cynicism\nwe were talking about. - Yep. - You know, and invalidation\nof any opposing thought or maybe that were even\nopposing opposition is an arrogant term, that's too strong. A lot of times it's not\neven opposition alternative other than, another way\nof thinking about it. Oh, could both be true. Oh, how could we parlay those two ideas? One of the challenges with these ideas of a third party\nor meet you in the middle. It's kind of got this\nhistoric notion of being, oh, well, here, come see, sort of mystery in between, kinda go which way the wind blows, I think done in the right way, and it doesn't have to be under a third party's name necessarily, but it's actually an incredibly rebellious position right now. And it's actually, and I love sports. It's tactically the place with which to move most advantageously. I think of their free safety\nin the game of football. They're in the middle of\nthe field and they're deep. They choose to defend left or right according to the play that's\nbeen called by the offense, similar to the offense, the running back. You read the defense and\nthen you're gonna run right to run left to go away\nfrom that opposition. It's a tactical spot. - To be truly independent and respond. - And respond. - So do you think you have a role in that, in political officers? - I don't know. It's on mine. It's not out of my mental box. And I gave it real sincere thought and discernment for over a year. And it's a wonderful, whether I end up getting\nin politics or not, it was a wonderful exercise. One that if anyone else\ngot time to do it, do it, to ask yourself what you would do if you were CEO.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Of a state, CEO of a\nnation, CEO of the world. That's a great thing to go. You wanna get your values line, woo-hoo. You wanna admit where you lie (chuckles) and throw yourself some pop quizzes and what if this phone\ncall comes at 4:00 AM. What you gonna, you know, who you wanna surround yourself with? It's really great questions to ask. And I think has helped\nme at a more micro level, be a better father and a better man. Take in considerations that I did not maybe take in as seriously\nbefore considering it. I don't know if that's in my future. Useful is a big word. I would've to be useful. I have to be useful in the right way. And is that my lane to be most useful? - It's a good question\nfor a leader to ask. How can I be useful? I have to ask you about \"Interstellar.\" So I think it's an incredible film. I've seen it inspire so many\nscientists and engineers. It's just philosopher, everybody, humans. It explores space travel,\nphysics of space time, human nature, human\ncondition, human connection. How has that film expanded\nyour understanding of the universe- - [Matthew] Yeah. - And our place in it?\n- Yeah. Well, it's the, it's got the old Mr. Mayor on the corner. How big is that cloud metaphor in it? Because that was the\ncharacter I played Cooper's that was the existential question for him. Head down, practical, stay here,\nbe a father to my children. But his dream before his children\nwere to go explore space. So when he's taking that truck out and the countdown's going down, that's the hinge of the\nexistential question that we all face in some form. The sense of time. I wish I think everyone\nloves that sense of where time can run at different speeds. And there's a incredible scene where Cooper as a father's getting\nvideo feed from his children who have aged and he's\nrealizing he's missed all that. (Lex laughs) - [Lex] Yeah. - I mean overall that, that concept makes me consider and imagine you wanna talk about mystical successes instead of engineered ones\nlike the engineered ones. There's ethos from that film and what Nolan put into\nthat film and theories that make me go, \"Yeah, what\ndoes any of this matter? Maybe we are, maybe we are, it makes me go, maybe this is all, it's already all been written. What's happening right now in\nthis flip of time you're here, 53 years so far, we'll\nsee how many we get. What other parallel timelines\nare happening out there? Is it small minded of us to\ndefine life on other planets as only something that\ncan live within a climate that has water in this amount of O2. Those terms maybe too small things. What do you mean? Are we saying only life has to have water in this amount of oxygen\nand carbon dioxide? Maybe there's a whole\nredefinition of the ingredients that other life forms need. It sure in a similar way to contact, there's a movie I did with Bob Zemeckis, inspires me that the universe\nis more active and lively and God's backyard's\nbigger than I thought. And wow, that's exciting. And people go now, yeah, you believe in extraterrestrial life. I said, yes man. I think it'd be arrogant\nnot to, I sure hope so. - You think there's alien\ncivilizations all out there, intelligent ones just far\nin, far on distance stars? - I hope so, and I think we, it's possible. May have many among us right here. And I go for the the the why not in that, just to keep that train\nof thought open to learn and consider those existential questions,\nI think be arrogant not to. - There's so many hundreds\nof billions of planets just in our galaxy. - [Matthew] Just in ours. - I can't imagine there's\nnot life out there, but I suspect it's very different, like you said, than we are. And we have to have a\nhumility to open our eyes to how different life could be. - Yeah. And if and when we cross it, unlike we've had a tendency to do when we try to go with\nsome nation takeovers, I think it would be our inherent glitch to go in believing that any\nother life form civilization wants to take over territories to go into it with thinking that okay, this is an opposition. I mean I think that's\na human trait of ours and to consider that another life form would have an interest that more land or more territory\n(chuckles) is good for them, I think it's a shallow idea. I don't think they're, I think of it more like\nwhen I think of heaven, those considerations are not in anyone's mind, heart or intent in the heaven that I think of. So in other civilization,\nthese things I don't I mean I hope that we would just see and would learn that it would be the natural side of welcoming. It wouldn't be a primate response to, no, I have fire and you're\ncoming over trying to put it out, or I have food and you're\ntrying to steal my food. I don't think it would be, I think it's a shallow\nthought to think that, oh, it's gonna be about ownership and we would be trespassing. I think it would be, I don't think they're would have a sense of borders as we do. - I just hope we humans\nare smart enough to detect and to see aliens, because of how different they are, we often have a very narrow definition of what is intelligence. It's very possible that trees\nare extremely intelligent, if we kinda zoom out-\n- [Matthew] Right. - At a different time scale or different like just look at stuff from a bigger perspective that's outside of being so human-centric. - It's a great quote that someone told me, this astrophysicist told me this, how accurate it is or not. Someone else can argue the validity of what I'm meant to say or not. But I thought it really was\na perspective grabber for me. Like look, see the universe\nwas created at midnight. Humans came around at\n11:59 and 36 seconds. I love the little analogies that frame like that make, oh yeah, the pale blue dot, there it is. That perspective. Something is so relaxing\nand empowering about that at the same time and humbling but confidence boosting allows forgiveness, allows ambition. I just love the perspective of that, that picture, to picture it\nthat way and our timeline. - Do you hope humans become\na multi-planetary species as we're trying to do as a\nSpaceX is pushing forward, traveling out to Mars,\npotentially colonizing Mars, colonizing other planets? - Yeah.\n(Lex laughs) Yeah, go, I love the ambition of it. I love the pioneering nature of it. I love the extension of what\nwe consider as our backyard becoming more four dimensional like that. Not at the expense of we still got stuff to take care of. We got gardens to tend right here, and sure as hell not to\ngo, not to quit on us, to go, oh, let's get outta here 'cause this isn't really working. No, no, no, no, no, no. We got a tithe, we're\nstill supposed to pay here. That's part of this pressure testing us as a civilization in the species, whether you call that restoration order or whether you call that, let's figure out how to adapt best we can. Not at the expense of\nquitting here on Earth. - But let a few select folks explore. - Yeah. - [Lex] 'Cause that's like. - I say go for it, please. - One of the coolest\nthings that we humans do, it's kind of embodies the human spirit. Reach out into the unknown. But it's hard. I mean as \"Interstellar\"\nshows and so on. (laughs) - Yeah. Well, and Elon talks about it, this is not gonna be a weekend daisy trip\n(Lex laughs) (laughs) and he's just\nspeculating how hard it could be. Much harder in different ways that he doesn't understand yet. - [Lex] Yeah. Well that, you know, that dance between the\nimpossible and the inevitable. That's definitely there, with what SpaceX is\ndoing with all the folks who are trying to become a multidisciplinary species\nare doing, it's really hard. It's like build rockets\nthat fight off gravity at a cost effective way is really hard. SpaceX is close to being\nbankrupt several times. It's just hard. But it's also inspiring that some people are just crazy enough, bold enough to keep trying. - [Matthew] Yeah. - What advice would you\ngive to young folks? - What advice would I give? - In high school and college that are thinking of how to make\ntheir way in this world? - If you haven't already, can you define what you\nhave an innate ability for and match that with what you're\nwilling to hustle to get? - [Lex] Yeah. - Sometimes we have an innate ability, but we don't wanna work for\nit and we take it for granted. And we end up doing\nsomething that may work, may pay the bills, may\nget us by day to day, but we don't really like it. We have trouble finding a way to enjoy it. Definitely don't love it. And then sometimes we don't know what our innate ability is and we're hustling and\nworking our tail off and breaking a sweat to do something that we really aren't that good at on an innate level. And that's good challenge. And you can work and\nbecome good at something, that you don't have an innate ability for. But if you can match those two, what do you have an innate ability to do? Which we have an innate ability\nto do when we do that well, we do kind of enjoy it. - Yeah, and one of the\nthings that requires us to kind of be really honest with yourself at what your innate ability is, 'cause oftentimes there's a lot of noise when you're growing up. People telling you what\nyou're good at, not good at. Like really you have to look at yourself, listen to yourself. That inner like a deep, rigorous self-analysis of\nwhat am I actually good at? Not what I hope to be good at, but what I'm actually good at. - Right. And then if you look at that, and you can define those two, hopefully, you can activate it in a way where there's a demand for what you supply. (Lex and Matthew laughs) - You found love with\nCamila Alves McConaughey. What advice would you give to\npeople on how to do just that? How to find love? - Huh.\n(Lex laughs) (laughs) This wonderful\nsubject has been discussed since the beginning of time, hasn't it? Love it. So I can tell you what\nthings I've kinda learned and still learning. Love is one of those mystical successes. It doesn't make sense. Before I met Camila, I was coming on to my late 30s as much as I'm not a person\nthat is guided by timelines, my life had not really added up to what I thought it was\ngonna be relationship-wise. I thought by that time I\nwould've met the woman I love, married, and started family,\nand that hadn't happened. And I did find myself doing that thing I was\ndoing at the Amazon, looking around the corner, any perspective possible female I met that I was attracted to, I was like, maybe this is the one. I make the joke, but it's true. It's like at every red light, I'm like checking out who's next to me in the produce section at the supermarket. I'm like, who's down the produce section? I was like looking.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - When you're in that zone, you can also be a little intrusive. You can trespass on people's, you can get outside of yourself. You can be overly impressed\nand not as involved and have your own\nconstitution and sit back. And therefore, if you're\noutside of yourself, you're less attractive\nto your possible mate. I've got a series of dreams\nthat I've written about, but I had one then that\nwas very spiritual. That was me as a 88 year old\nbachelor who never got married, and it was a beautiful dream. Where on paper I thought\nthat should be a nightmare. It wasn't. What that dream did for\nme was allowed me to go, you may not find the woman for you and get married and have a life with her, that may not be. And for the first time in\nlife I was okay with that. More than intellectually,\nspiritually, I was grounded. I was like, okay. Then I'm moving through the world. And on this particular night as myself, not intruding, I was inviting. I did see her move across the room and did not say, who is that? I said, what is that? (chuckles) (Lex laughs) And then did move to\ncall her across the room. So I did invite, but I was not outside of myself and I was able to be myself\nwith her, what my eyes saw, everything that she turned out to be when the lens got zoomed\nin more details got known. And we began to talk and got more intimate and closer together and spend more time, became true, and then some, but every single thing that I imagined when I saw her move across\nthe room turned out to be true and then some. Just the image. We had similar moral bottom line about life, each other. How we treat ourselves, what we respect, what our own constitutions were. We had similar perspectives on raising children, which is very important to me and her. And then we just enjoyed\neach other's company. - [Lex] Yeah. - And we laughed together\nand we support each other and we promoted more of each other and we lit each other's fire and we, if one was rolling, we kept dishing. Go, go, go again, take the next shot, more, more, more, more. This was a biggie too. - Getting excited for\neach other's success. - Yes. Yes. To be able, I think it's very important. We all have jealousy, I get it. But it's very important to be able, if you can be happy for\nyour lover when they succeed or are succeeding or are\nacross the room at the party, laughing with the stranger to be happy for them when it\nhas nothing to do with you. I would be away, she would, the questions and the\ntalks, we would have, she was happy for me about how\nexcited I was about my day, and my day had nothing to do with her. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- She wasn't there. And I found myself not telling\nmyself to be happy for her, but being really, really happy for her when she would tell me about something that happened that day with her. And as much as I went through my head, oh, I'd have been great\nif I would've been there. - [Lex] Yeah. - I was like, no, I don't\nonly trespass on that. That you had that.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - Independent of me. Bravo. - That's a choice you make not to give any time to the jealousy, to the very natural jealousy\nthat we humans have. - It sure doesn't happen any, I don't see the residuals in in it. - [Lex] (laughs) True. - I've got it. I've had it and I have it. I just don't, you know, I haven't seen where, it has any payback. - I gotta ask you the\nbiggest possible question. What's the meaning of this whole thing? - Oh. - [Lex] What's the meaning of life? - Right. - (chuckles) Matthew McConaughey. Why, why are we here? - I don't know why were here. I prescribed to, in a religious sense,\nthe restoration order. We're here to restore order. In religious sense, I really, I purchased that and love\nthat incentive and love that, that view, but I don't\nreally know why we're here. But I do know to go back\nto the front, we are here. That part's inevitable. So now let's flip the script\nand go to the why not. Just keep living. What are we doing? The base of everything\nand we can argue not, the base of it. All I can come up with is well just keep living, man. I mean, what else are we supposed to do when we don't have any idea what to do? When we know exactly what we wanna do. Make it matter. Even when it doesn't matter, that matters. For what? I don't know. For the fun of it, that matters. - Yeah, our ability to create meaning and beauty in the mundane, in the absurd. It's kind of cool.\n- [Matthew] Yeah. - (laughs) And then we\nshare it with each other. - [Matthew] Yeah.\n- We get excited. - [Matthew] Yeah. - And we create some pretty\ncool stuff along the way. - I mean, I say I'm confident enough, and I might be arrogant for me to say, but I do believe that we're here to each\ngeneration have a small ascension. - [Lex] Yeah. - Or else what's it for? (laughs) - And we're not really\nsure what the ascension is towards just kind of- - No. No, I just think it's up. Do you think it's up? I do think that it is definitely arrogant to think that we as a species or\ngeneration or people or humanity are going to reach the top\nof the ascended staircase and go, ta-da! (laughs) I think that is not only false, but I think it's full-hearted. And I think it's this recipe for being, having more angst, and even cynicism we\ntalked about and unrest and lack of seeing beauty\nand joy in this life while we're in it. I think life's a verb. Live it as best we can. Hopefully, I mean, I don't know. Sometimes I'm just, I\ndon't have a grand plan. Man, I'm just trying to connect the dot. I'm confused, frustrated. I don't know what, I don't feel any gravity\nor building or lineage towards what I'm doing. And I'm just like going, what's that Peterson line? If you don't believe in heaven, do what you can to get as far\naway from hell as possible sometimes.\n(Lex laughs) - [Lex] Yeah.\n- It's a great line. Sometimes I'm just trying\nto like, man, just don't, don't sink the ship right now. Just keep your head above water. Maintain, just try and hold on. - And hopefully give yourself\na chance to notice the magic, the mystical. I try to do that.\n- [Matthew] Yeah. - When it gets rough. - Because it's there. I do believe it's all\naround us all the time. - [Lex] Yeah. - Just are we on a frequency and do we allow ourselves\nto receive it and see it? - [Lex] We gotta tune the radio. - Yeah. Because we look for it too hard. We see false idols, and\nif we don't look at all, we become callous and miss it all. - Yeah. It's a fun little life we got. - [Matthew] Yeah. - Matthew, I'm a huge fan. I think you're an incredible person. Thank you for all the, everything you've created in this world. Thank you for being a unique\nhuman that inspires millions, and thank you for talking today. I was nervous, but you\nmade me feel at home. That was beautiful. - Well, I felt at home\ntalking with you as well. (Lex laughs) Thanks for sharing that with me. I could go on and on. - Just two Texans. (laughs) - That's right. Having newly moved Austin, Texas. Here we go. - All right, thank you, brother. - Thank you. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Matthew McConaughey.
