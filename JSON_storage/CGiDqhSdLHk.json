My biggest fear in a way is that life is everywhere but we've become infinitely more lonely because of our scaffolding\nin that combinatorial space. - The following is a\nconversation with Lee Cronin.

      "section": "Assembly theory paper",
      "text": "So your big assembly theory\npaper was published in \"Nature\". - Yeah.\n- Congratulations. - [Lee] Thanks.\n- It created, I think it's fair to say, a lot of controversy but also a lot of interesting discussion. So maybe I can try to\nsummarize assembly theory and you tell me if I'm wrong. - [Lee] Go for it. - So assembly theory says that if we look at any object in the universe, any object, that we can quantify how complex it is by trying to find the number\nof steps it took to create it. And also, we can determine if it was built by a process akin to evolution by looking at how many copies\nof the object there are. - [Lee] Yeah, that's spot on. - Spot on?\n- Spot on. - I was not expecting that. Okay, so let's go through definitions. So there's a central equation\nI'd love to talk about, but definition-wise, what is an object? - (chuckles) Yeah, an object. So if I'm gonna try to be\nas meticulous as possible, objects need to be finite and they need to be\ndecomposable into subunits. All human-made artifacts are objects. Is a planet an object? Probably yes, if you scale out. So an object is finite and\ncountable and decomposable, I suppose mathematically. But, yeah, I still wake up some days and think to myself what is an object? Because it's a nontrivial question. - \"Persists over time.\" I'm quoting from the paper here. \"An object is finite, is distinguishable.\" So that's a weird adjective. \"Distinguishable.\" (chuckles) - We've had so many people help offering to rewrite the paper after it came out. Yeah, you wouldn't believe,\nit's so funny. (laughing) - \"Persists over time\nand is breakable such that the set of\nconstraints to construct it from elementary building\nblocks is quantifiable. Such that the set of\nconstraints to construct it from elementary building\nblocks is quantifiable.\" - The history is in the objects. It's kind of cool, right? - Okay, so what defines the object is it's history or memory, whichever is the sexier word. - I'm happy with both,\ndepending on the day. (laughing) - Okay. So, \"the set of steps it\ntook to create the object.\" So there's a sense in which every object in the universe has a history, and that is part of the thing that is used to describe its complexity. How complicated it is.\n- Yeah. Okay, what is an assembly index? - So the assembly index, if you're to take the object apart and be super lazy about it or minimal, 'cause, you know, it's like you've got a really short-term memory,. So what you do is you lay all the parts on the path and you\nfind the minimum number of steps you take on the path\nto add the parts together to reproduce the object, and that minimum number\nis the assembly index. There's a minimum bound. And it was always my\nintuition the minimum bound and assembly theory was really important, and only worked out why a few weeks ago, which is kind of funny, because I was just like,\n\"No this is sacrosanct. I dunno why. It'll come to me one day.\" And then when I was pushed\nby a bunch of mathematicians, we came up with the correct\nphysical explanation, which I can get to, but it's the minimum, and it's really important, is the minimum. And the reason I knew\nthe minimum was right is 'cause we could measure it. So almost before this paper came out, we published papers,\nexplain how you can measure the assembly index of molecules. - Okay, so that's not so\ntrivial to figure out. So when you look at an object, we could say a molecule, we could say object more generally. To figure out the minimum number of steps it takes to create that object, that doesn't seem like\na trivial thing to do. - So with molecules, it's not trivial, but it is possible\nbecause what you can do. And because I'm a chemist, so I'm kind of like I\nsee the lens of the world through just chemistry. I break the molecule apart, break bonds. And if you take a molecule\nand you break it all apart you have a bunch of atoms, and then you say okay I'm\ngoing to then take the atoms and form bonds and go up the chain of events to make the molecule. And that's what made me realize, take a toy example,\nliterally a toy example, take a Lego object which is\nbroken up of Lego blocks. So you could do exactly the same thing. In this case, the Lego blocks\nare naturally the smallest, they're the atoms in the actual\ncomposite Lego architecture. But then, if you maybe take, you know, a couple of blocks and put\nthem together in a certain way, maybe they're offset in some way. That offset is on the memory, you can use that offset again\nwith only a penalty of one, and you can then make a square,\ntriangle, and keep going. And you remember those\nmotifs on the chain. So you can then leap from the start, with all the Lego blocks or atoms just laid out in front of you and say right, I'll take you, you, you, connect, and do the least amount of work. So it's really like the\nsmallest steps you can take on the graft to make the object. And so for molecules, it\ncame relatively intuitively, and then we started to\napply it to language. We've even started to apply\nit to mathematical theorems. But I'm so well outta my depth. But it looks like you can\ntake a minimum set of axioms and then start to build up kind of mathematical architectures\nin the same way, and then the shortest path to get there is something interesting\nthat I don't yet understand. - So what's the computational complexity of figuring out the shortest\npath with molecules, with language, with mathematical theorems? It seems like once you have the fully constructed Lego castle or whatever your favorite Lego world is, figuring out how to get there from the basic building blocks. Is that hard problem? - It's a hard problem, but actually if you look at it. So the best way to look at it. For this, take a molecule. So if the molecule has 13 bonds, first of all take 13\ncopies of the molecule and just cut all the\nbonds, so cut 12 bonds, and then you just put them in order. And then, that's how it works. And you keep looking\nfor symmetry or copies, so you can then shorten it as you go down, and that becomes\ncombinatorially quite hard. For some natural product molecules, it becomes very hard. It's not impossible, but we're looking at the\nbounds on that at the moment. But as the object gets bigger, it becomes really hard. And the that's bad news. But the good news is there are shortcuts. And we might even be able\nto physically measure the complexity without\ncomputationally calculating it, which is kind of insane. - [Lex] Wait, wait, how would you do that? - Well, in the case of a molecule, so if you shine light on a molecule, let's take it infrared, the molecule has each of the bonds absorbs the infrared differently in with what we call the fingerprint region. And because it's quantized as well, you have all these discreet\nkind of absorbances. And my intuition, after we realized we could\ncut molecules up in mass spec, that was the first go at this. We did it with using infrared. And the infrared gave us an even better correlation assembly index. And we used another technique as well in addition to infrared, called NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance, which tells you about the number of different magnetic\nenvironments in a molecule, and that also worked out. So we have three techniques which each of them independently gives us the same, or tending towards the same, assembly index from a molecule that we can calculate mathematically. - [Lex] Okay, so these are all methods of mass spectrometry, mass spec. You scan a molecule, it gives you data in the form of a mass spectrum. And you're saying that the data correlates to the assembly index? - [Lee] Yeah. - How generalizable is that shortcut, first of all to chemistry, and second of all beyond that? 'Cause that seems like a nice hack, and you're extremely knowledgeable about various aspects of chemistry, so you can say, okay, it kinda correlates. But, you know, the whole idea\nbehind assembly theory paper and perhaps why it's so controversial is that it reaches bigger, it reaches for the bigger general theory of objects in the universe. - Yeah, I'd say so. I'd agree. So, I've started assembly theory of emoticons with my\nlab, believe it or not. So we take emojis, pixelate them, and work out the assembly\nindex of the emoji, and then work out how\nmany emojis you can make on the path of the emoji. So there's the uber emoji from which all other emojis emerge, so you can then take a photograph, and by looking at the shortest path, by reproducing the pixels\nto make the image you want, you can measure that. So then you start to be\nable to take spatial data. Now there's some problems there. What is then the definition of the object? How many pixels? How do you break it down? And so we're just learning\nall this right now. - How do you begin to\ncompute the assembly index of a graphical like a set\nof pixels on a 2D plane that form a thing? - So you would first of all\ndetermine the resolution. What is your XY, and what are the number\non the X and Y plane, and then look at the surface area, and then you take all your emojis and make sure they're all\nlooked at the same resolution, and then we would basically then do exactly the same thing we\nwould do for cutting the bonds. You'd cut bits out of the emoji. You'd have a bag of pixels, and you would then add\nthose pixels together to make the overall emoji. - Wait, wait a minute. But, like, first of all, I mean, this is at the core\nsort of machine learning and computer vision. Not every pixel's that important. And there's like macro features, there's micro features and\nall that kind of stuff. - [Lee] Exactly. - Like, you know, the eyes\nappear in a lot of them, the smile appears in a lot of them. - So in the same way in chemistry we assume the bond is fundamental. What we're doing here is\nwe assume the resolution at the scale at which\nwe do it is fundamental, and we are just working that out. And you are right, that\nwill change, right? Because as you take your lens out a bit, it will change dramatically. But it's just a new way of looking at not just compression, what we do right now in\ncomputer science and data, one big kind of misunderstanding as assembly theory is telling you about how compressed the object is. That's not right. It's a how much information is required on a chain of events. 'Cause the nice thing is, when you do compression\nin computer science, we're wandering a bit here, but it's kind of worth wandering I think. And you assume you have\ninstantaneous access to all the information in the memory. In assembly theory, you say, no, you don't get access to that memory until you've done the work. And then when you've done\naccess to that memory, you can have access but\nnot to the next one. And this is how in assembly theory we talk about the four universes, the assembly universe,\nthe assembly possible, and the assembly contingent, and then the assembly observed. And they're all scales in\nthis combinatorial universe. - Yeah. Can you explain each one of them? - Yep, so the assembly\nuniverse is like anything goes, It's just combinatorial kind\nof explosion in everything. - [Lex] So that's the biggest one? - [Lee] That's the\nbiggest one. It's massive. - Assembly universe, assembly possible, assembly contingent, assembly observed, and the y-axis is assembly steps in time. And, you know, and the X-axis is as the thing expands through time, more and more unique objects appear. - So assembly universe, everything goes. Assembly possible, laws\nof physics come in. In this case, in chemistry bonds. So that means- - [Lex] Those are extra\nconstraints, I guess. - Yes, and they're the only constraints. They're the constraints at the base. So the way to look at is\nyou've got all your atoms, they're quantized and you\ncan just bang them together. So in the way in computer science speak, I suppose the assembly universe is just like no laws of physics, things can fly through mountains, beyond the speed of light. In the assembly possible, you have to apply the laws of physics, but you can get access to all\nthe motifs instantaneously with no effort. So that means you could make anything. Then the assembly contingent says, no, you can't have access to\nthe highly assembled object in the future until you've\ndone the work in the past on the causal chain, and that's really the\nreally interesting shift where you go from assembly\npossible to assembly contingent. That is really the key\nthing in assembly theory that says you cannot just\nhave instantaneous access to all those memories. You have to have done the work somehow, the universe has to have somehow built a system that allows\nyou to select that path rather than other paths. And then the final thing, the assembly observed\nis basically us saying, oh, these are the things we actually see. We can go backwards now and understand that they have been created\nby this causal process. - But wait a minute. So when you say the\nuniverse has to construct the system that does the work, is that like the environment that allows for, like, selection? - Yeah.\n- So that's the thing that does the selection? - You could think about in terms of a Von Neumann constructor\nversus a selection of ribosome, Tesla as a plant,\nassembling Teslas, you know? The difference between the\nassembly universe in Tesla land and the Tesla factory is everyone says, \"No, Teslas are just easy,\nthey just spring out. You know how to make them all.\" At Tesla factory, you have\nto put things in sequence and out comes a Tesla. - So you're talking about the factory? - Yes. This is this is really nice. Super important point is that when I talk about the universe having a memory or there's some magic, it's not that. It's that tells you that there must be a process encoded somewhere in physical reality, be it a cell, a Tesla factory, or something else that is making that object. I'm not saying there's\nsome kind of woo-woo memory in the universe, you know,\nmorphic resonance or something, I'm saying that there is\nan actual causal process that is being directed,\nconstrained in some way. So it's not kind of\njust making everything. - Yeah, but, Lee, what's the factory that made the factory? So first of all, you\nassume the laws of physics has just sprung to\nexistence at the beginning. Those are constraints. But what makes the factory the environment that does the selection? - Well, it's the first\ninteresting question that I want to answer out of four. I think the factory\nemerges in the interplay between the environment and the objects that are being built. I'll have a go at explaining\nto you the shortest path. So why is the shortest path important? I'm gonna have to go with\nchemistry for a moment then abstract it. So imagine you've got\nan given environment, that you have a budget of atoms you're just flinging together. And the objective of those atoms that are being flung together, in say molecule A, they decompose. So molecules decompose over time. So the molecules in this environment, in this magic environment, have to not die, but they do die. They have a half-life. So the only way the\nmolecules can get through that environment out the other side. Let's pretend the environment is a box, you can go in and out without dying. And there's just an infinite\nsupply of atoms coming, well, a large supply. The molecule gets built, but the molecule is able to\ntemplate itself being built and survives in the environment, will basically reign supreme. Now let's say that that\nmolecule takes 10 steps and it's using a finite\nset of atoms, right? Now let's say another molecule, smart-ass molecule\nwe'll call it, comes in, and can survive in that\nenvironment and can copy itself, but it only needs five steps. The molecule that only needs five steps, 'cause both molecules are being destroyed but they're creating themselves faster than they can be destroyed, you can see that the\nshortest path reigns supreme. So the shortest path tells us\nsomething super interesting about the minimal amount\nof information required to propagate that motif in time and space, and it seems to be like some\nkind of conservation law. - So one of the intuitions you have is the propagation of motifs, in time, will be done by the things\nthat can construct themselves in the shortest path. So like, you can assume\nthat most of the objects in the universe are built\nin the most efficient way? Big leap I just took there. - Yes and no, because\nthere are other things. So in the limit, yes, because you want to tell the difference between things that\nhave required a factory to build them and just random processes. But you can find instances where the shortest path isn't taken for an individual object,\na individual function. And people go, \"Ah, that means the shortest path isn't right.\" And then I say, \"Well, I don't know, I think it's right still because there are other driving forces, so it's not just one molecule. Now that you start to\nconsider two objects, you have a joint assembly space, and now it's a compromise between not just making A\nand B in the shortest path, you wanna be able to make A\nand B in the shortest path, which might mean that\nA is slightly longer. You have a compromise. So when you see slightly more nesting in the construction when\nyou take a given object that can look longer, well, that's because the overall function is the object is still\ntrying to be efficient. And this is still very hand-wavy. I maybe have no legs to stand on, but we think we're getting\nsomewhere with that. - And there's probably some\nparallelization, right? - Yeah.\n- So this is not sequential, the building is. Yeah, I guess-\n- No, you're right. - When you're talking\nabout complex objects, you don't have to work sequentially, you can work in parallel. You can get your friends\ntogether and they can- - Yeah. And the thing we're working on right now is how to understand\nthese parallel processes. Now there's a new thing we've introduced called assembly depth. And assembly depth can be lower than the assembly index for a molecule when they're cooperating together, 'cause exactly, parallel\nprocessing is going on. And my team have been working\nthis out in the last few weeks because we're looking at\nwhat compromises does nature need to make when it's\nmaking molecules in a cell. And I wonder if, you know, I'm maybe like, well, I'm always leaping\nout of my competence, but in economics, I'm just wondering if you could apply this in an economic process. It seems like capitalism is very good at finding the shortest\npath, you know, every time. And there are ludicrous things that happen because actually the cost\nfunction's been minimized. And so I keep seeing parallels everywhere where there are complex nested systems, where if you give it enough time and you introduce a bit of heterogeneity, the system readjusts and\nfinds a new shortest path. But the shortest path isn't\nfixed on just one molecule now, it's in the actual existence\nof the object over time. And that object could be a city, it could be a cell, it could be a factory. But I think we're going\nway beyond molecules and my competence, so probably we should\ngo back to molecules. But, hey. - All right, before we get too far,"

      "section": "Assembly equation",
      "text": "let's talk about the assembly equation. Okay, how should we do this? Lemme just even read\nthat part of the paper. \"We define assembly as the total amount of selection necessary\nto produce an ensemble of observed objects,\nquantified using equation 1.\" The equation basically has A on one side, which is the assembly of the ensemble, and then a sum from 1 to N, where N is the total\nnumber of unique objects. And then there is a\nfew variables in there, that include the assembly index, the copy number, which we'll talk about. I don't remember you talking about that. That's an interesting addition, and I think a powerful one. Has to do with that you can create pretty\ncomplex objects randomly. And in order to know\nthat they're not random, that there's a factory involved, you need to see a bunch of them. That's the intuition there. It's a interesting intuition. And then some normalization. What else is a N? - N - 1. Just to make sure that one object could be a one-off and random. And then you have more\nthan one identical object. That's interesting. - When there's two of a thing. That's interesting.\n- Two of a thing is super important, especially if the assembly index is high. - So we could say several questions here. One, let's talk about selection. What is this term, selection? What is this term, evolution,\nthat we're referring to? Which aspect of Darwinian evolution are we referring to\nthat's interesting here? - Yeah so, you know the paper, we should talk about\nthe paper for a second. The paper, what it did\nis it kind of annoyed- We didn't annoy. I mean, it got the attention, and obviously the angry\npeople were annoyed. - There's angry people in\nthe world. That's good. - So what happened is the\nevolutionary biologists got angry. We were not expecting that. 'Cause we thought evolutionary\nbodies would be cool. I knew that some, not many, computational complexity\npeople will get angry, 'cause I've kinda been poking them, and maybe I deserved it. But I was trying to poke\nthem in a productive way. And then the physicists kind of got grumpy because the initial\nconditions tell everything. The prebiotic chemist got slightly grumpy because there's not\nenough chemistry in there. And then finally, when\nthe creationist said it wasn't creationist enough, I was like, I've done my job. - Because you're basically saying that physics is not\nenough to tell the story of how biology emerges. - I think so.\n- And then they said a few physics is the beginning\nand the end of the story. - Yeah. So what happened is the\nreason why people put the phone down on the call of the paper. I mean, if you're the reading the paper like a phone call, they\ngot to the abstract. And in the abstract- - [Lex] First sentence is pretty strong. - The first two sentences\ncaused everybody- - \"Scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution with the immutable laws of the\nuniverse defined by physics.\" - True, right? There's nothing wrong with that statement. Totally true. - Yeah.\n- Next one. \"These laws underpin life's origin, evolution and the development of human culture and technology, yet they do not predict the\nemergence of these phenomena.\" Wow. First of all, we should\nsay the title of the paper. This paper was accepted\nand published in \"Nature\". The title is \"Assembly theory explains and quantifies selection and evolution\". A very humble title. And the entirety of the paper I think presents interesting\nideas but reaches high. - I would do it all again. This paper was actually\non the preprint server for over a year. - You regret nothing. - I think, yeah, I don't regret anything. - You and Frank Sinatra did it your way. - What I love about being a scientist is kind of sometimes, 'cause I'm a bit dim and I don't understand\nwhat people are telling me. I wanna get to the point. This paper says, hey, the laws\nof physics are really cool, the universe is great, but it's not intuitive that you just run the standard model and get life out. I think most physicists might go, yeah, you know, we can't just go back and say that's what happened 'cause physics can't explain\nthe origin of life yet. That doesn't mean it won't or can't, okay? Just to be clear, sorry, intelligent designers,\nwe are gonna get there. Second point, we say that evolution works but we don't know how evolution got going, so biological evolution\nand biological selection. So for me, this seems\nlike a simple continuum. So when I mentioned\nselection and evolution in the title, I think,\nand in the abstract, we should have maybe prefaced that and said nonbiological selection and nonbiological evolution, and then that might have made\nit even more crystal clear. But I didn't think that\nevolutionary biology should be so bold to claim ownership of selection and evolution. And secondly, a lot of\nevolutionary biologists seem to dismiss the\norigin of life question, just say it's obvious. And that causes a real\nproblem scientifically. When the physicists are like, we own the universe, the universe is good, we explain all of it, look at us. And the biologists say\nwe can explain biology. And the poor chemist in the middle going, but, hang on. (laughing) And this paper kinda says, hey, there is an interesting disconnect between physics and biology. And that's at the point at which memories get made in chemistry through bonds. And hey, let's look at this close and see if we can quantify it. So yeah, I mean I never expected the paper to kind of get that much interest. And still, I mean it's only been published just over a month ago now. - So just to link on the selection. What is the broader sense\nof what selection means? - Yeah, that's a really good. For selection, so this is where for me the concept of an object is\nsomething that can persist in time and not die, but\nbasically can be broken up. So if I was gonna kind of bolster the definition of an objects. So if something can form and persist for a long period of time\nunder an existing environment that could destroy other, and I'm gonna use anthropomorphic terms, I apologize, but weaker\nobjects or less robust, then the environment\ncould have selected that. So a good chemistry example is if you took some carbon and you made a chain of carbon atoms. Whereas, if you took some, I don't know, some carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen and made chains from those, you'd start to get different\nreactions and rearrangements. So a chain of carbon atoms\nmight be more resistant to falling apart under\nacidic or basic conditions versus another set of molecules. So it survives in that environment. So the acid pond the resistant\nmolecule can get through. And then that molecule goes\ninto another environment. So that environment now\nmaybe being acid pond is a basic pond, or maybe\nit's an oxidizing pond. And so, if you've got carbon and it goes in an oxidizing pond, maybe the carbon starts to\noxidize and break apart. So you go through all these\nkind of obstacle courses, if you like, given by reality. So selection happens\nwhen a object survives in an environment for some time. But, and this is the\nthing that's super subtle, the object has to be\ncontinually being destroyed and made by a process. So it's not just about the object now, it's about the process\nand time that makes it. 'Cause a rock could just\nstand on the mountainside for four billion years and\nnothing happened to it. And that's not necessarily\nreally advanced selection. So for selection to\nget really interesting, you need to have a turnover in time. You need to be continually\ncreating objects, producing them, what\nwe call discovery time. So there's a discovery time for an object. When that object is discovered, if it's say a molecule, that can then act on itself or the chain of events that caused itself to bolster its formation, then you go from discovery\ntime to production time, and suddenly you have more\nof it in the universe, so it could be a\nself-replicating molecule. And the interaction of the\nmolecule in the environment, in the warm little pond\nor in the sea or wherever, in the bubble, could then start to build a\nproto factory, the environment. So really, to answer your question, what the factory is. The factory is the environment, but it's not very autonomous, it's not very redundant, there's lots of things\nthat could go wrong. So once you get high\nenough up the hierarchy of networks of interactions, something needs to happen, that needs to be compressed\ninto a smaller volume and made resistant or robust. Because in biology, selection and evolution is robust. That you have error correction built in. You have really, you know, there's good ways of basically making sure propagation goes on. So really the difference between inorganic abiotic\nselection and evolution, and evolution and stuff\nin biology is robustness, the ability to survive in lots\nof different environments. Whereas, our poor little\ninorganic soul molecule, whatever, just dies in lots of\ndifferent environments. So there's something\nsuper special that happens from the inorganic molecule\nin the environment, it kills it, to where you've got evolution and cells can survive everywhere. - Well, how special is that? How do you know those\nkinds of evolution factors aren't everywhere in the universe? - I don't. And I'm excited, 'cause I think selection isn't special at all. I think what is special is the history of the environments on earth that gave rise to the first cell that now, you know, has taken all those environments and is now more autonomous. And I would like to think that, you know, this paper could be very wrong, (chuckles) but I don't think it's very wrong. It mean, it's certainly wrong, but it's less wrong than some\nother ideas I hope, right? And if this inspires us to go and look for selection in the universe, 'cause we now have an equation where we can say we can\nlook for selection going on and say, oh, that's interesting, we seem to have a process that's giving us high copy number objects that also are highly complex. But that doesn't look\nlike life as we know it. And we use that and say, \"oh, there's a hydrothermal vent. Or there's a process going on, there's molecular networks.\" Because the assembly\nequation is not only meant to identify at the higher\nend, advanced selection. What you get, I would call it in biology, your super advanced selection. And even, I mean, you could\nuse the assembly equation to look for technology and God forbid, we could talk about\nconsciousness and abstraction, but let's keep it primitive,\nmolecules and biology. So I think the real power\nof the assembly equation is to say how much selection\nis going on in this space. And there's a really simple\nthought experiment I could do. Is, you know, have a little petri dish, and on that petri dish,\nyou put some simple food. So the assembly index of all the sugars and everything is quite low. And you put a single E. coli cell. And then you say, I'm\ngonna I'm gonna measure this amount of assembly in the box. So it's quite low, but the rate of change of assembly, the ADT will go, voom sigmoidal as it eats all the food. And the number of E.\ncoli cells will replicate because they take all the food, they can copy themselves, the assembly index of all the molecules goes up, up, up, and up until the food is exhausted in the box. So now the E. coli's stop. I mean, die is probably a strong word. They stop respiring 'cause\nall the food has gone. But suddenly the amount\nof assembly in the box has gone up gigantically because\nof that one E. coli factory has just eaten through, milled lots of other E. coli factories, run out of food and stopped. So in the initial box, although the amount of\nassembly was really small, it was able to replicate and\nuse all the food and go up. And that's what we're trying\nto do in the lab actually, is kinda make those kind of experiments and see if we can spot the emergence of molecular networks that\nare producing complexity as we feed in raw materials and we feed a challenge, an environment, you know, we try and kill the molecules. And really that's the main kind of idea for the entire paper. - Yeah, and see if you\ncan measure the changes in the assembly index\nthroughout the whole system."

      "text": "Okay, what about if I\nshow up to a new planet, we go to Mars or some other planet from a different solar system, how do we use assembly index\nthere to discover alien life? - Very simply actually. Let's say we'll go to Mars\nwith a mass spectrometer with a sufficiently high resolution. So what you'll have to be able to do- So a good thing about mass spec is that you can select the\nmolecule from the mass, and then, if it's high enough resolution, you can be more and more sure that you're just seeing identical copies. You can count them. And then you fragment them and you count the number of fragments and look at the molecular weight. And the higher the molecular weight and the higher the number of fragments, the higher the assembly index. So if you go to Mars\nand you take a mass spec with a high enough resolution\nand you can find molecules, and I'll give a guide on earth, if you could find molecules say greater than 350 molecular weight\nwith more than 15 fragments, you have found artifacts\nthat can only be produced, at least on earth, by life. And now you would say, oh, well, maybe the geological process. I would argue very vehemently\nthat that is not the case. But we can say, look, if you don't like the cutoff on earth, go up higher, 30, 100, right? Because there's gonna be a point where you'll find a molecule with\nso many different parts the chances of you getting a molecule that has 100 different parts and finding a million identical copies, you know, that's just impossible, that could never happen in\nan infinite set of universes. - Can you just linger on\nthis copy number thing? A million different copies. What do you mean by copies, and why is the number of copies important? - Yeah, that was so interesting. I always understood the copy\nnumber was really important but I never explained\nit properly for ages. It goes back to this. If I give you a, I dunno, a really complicated molecule and I say it's complicated, you could say, hey,\nthat's really complicated, but is it just really random? And so I realized that ultimate randomness and ultimate complexity\nare indistinguishable until you can see a\nstructure in the randomness. So you can see copies. - So copies implies structure. - [Lee] Yeah, the factory. - I mean, there's a deep\nprofound thing in there. 'Cause, like, if you just\nhave a random process, you're going to get a lotta complex, beautiful sophisticated things. What makes them complex\nin the way we think life is complex or something like a factory that's operating under\na selection processes, there should be copies. Is there like some looseness about copies? Like, what does it mean for\ntwo objects to be equal? - It's all to do with the the telescope or the microscope you're using. And so, at the maximum resolution. So then the nice thing about chemists is they have this concept of the molecule and they're all familiar\nwith the molecule, and molecules you can hold, you know, on your hand, lots of\nthem, identical copies. A molecule's actually a super\nimportant thing in chemistry. To say, look, you can\nhave a mole of a molecule, so an Avogadro's number of\nmolecules and they're identical. What does that mean? That means that the molecular composition, the bonding and so on, the configuration is indistinguishable. You can hold them together, you can overlay them. So the way I do it is if I say, here's a bag of 10 identical molecules, let's prove they're identical. You pick one out of the bag and you basically observe\nit using some technique, and then you take it away, and then you take another one out. If you observe it using technique and you see no differences,\nthey're identical. It's really interesting to get right, because if you take say two molecules. Molecules can be in different vibrational and rotational states, they're moving all the time. So with this respect, identical molecules\nhave identical bonding. In this case, we don't\neven talk about chirality 'cause we don't have a chirality detector. So two identical molecules in one conception assembly theory, basically considers both\nhands as being the same. But of course, they're\nnot, they're different. As soon as you have a chiral distinguisher to detect the left and the right hand, they become different. And so it's to do with\nthe detection system that you have and the resolution. - So I wonder if there's an art in science to which detection system is used when you show up to a new planet? So like, you're talking\nabout chemistry a lot today. We have kind of standardized\ndetection systems, right? Of how to compare molecules. So, you know, when you\nstart to talk about emojis, and language, and mathematical theorems, and, I don't know, more\nsophisticated things at different scale, at a smaller scale than molecules, at a larger\nscale of than molecules. Like if we look at the\ndifference between you and me, Lex and Lee, are we the same? Are we different? - Sure, I mean of course\nwe're different close up, but if you zoom out a little bit, it will morphologically look the same. You know, high in characteristics, hair length, stuff like that. - Well, also like the species. - [Lee] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And also, there's a sense\nwhy we're both from earth. - Yeah, I agree. I mean, this is the power of\nassembly theory in that regard. So the way to look at it, if you have a box of objects, if they're all indistinguishable, we're using your technique, what you then do is you then\nlook at the assembly index. Now, if the assembly index\nof them is really low, right? And they're all indistinguishable, then they're telling you that you have to go to another resolution. You know, it's kind of a sliding scale. It's kind of nice.\n- Yeah, got it. So those two kind of are\nat tension with each other, the number of copies\nin the assembly index. - [Lee] Yeah. - That's really, really interesting. So okay, so you show up to a new planet, you'll be doing what? - [Lee] I would do mass spec. - On a sample of what? First of all, like how big\nof a scoop do you take? Do you just take a scoop? So we're looking for primitive life. - Yeah, so if you're just going to Mars or Titan or Enceladus or somewhere. So a number of ways of doing it. So you could take a large scoop or you go through the\natmosphere and detect stuff. And you could make a life meter, right? One of Sara's colleagues,\nan ASU, Paul Davies, keeps calling it a life meter. Which is quite a nice idea, because if you think about it, if you've got a living system that's producing these\nhighly complex molecules and they drift away\nand they're in a highly kind of demanding environment, they could be burnt, right? So they could just be falling apart. So you want to sniff a\nlittle bit of complexity and say, warmer, warmer, warmer. Oh, we've found life. We've found the alien. We found the alien Elon\nMusk smoking a joint in the bottom of the cave on Mars, or Elon himself, whatever, right? And say, okay, found it. So what you can do is\nthe mass spectrometer, you could just look for\nthings in the gas phase, or you go on the surface, drill down, because you want to\nfind molecules that are- You've either gotta find\nthe source living system, because the problem with\njust looking for complexity is it gets burnt away. So in a harsh environment, on, say, the surface of Mars, there's a very low probability that you're gonna find\nreally complex molecules because of all the radiation and so on. If you drill down a little bit, you could drill down a bit into soil that's billions of years old, then I would put in some\nsolvent, water, alcohol, or something, or take a scoop, make it volatile, put it\ninto the mass spectrometer, and just try and detect a high complexity, high abundant molecules. And if you get them, hey presto, you can have evidence of life. Wouldn't that then be\ngreat if you could say, okay, we found evidence of life, now we want to keep the\nlife meter keep searching for more and more complexity until you actually find living cells. You can get those new living cells, and then you could\nbring them back to earth or you could try and sequence them. You could see that they have\ndifferent DNA and proteins. - Go along on the gradient\nof the life meter. How would you build a life meter? Let's say we're together starting a new- - Just a mass spectrometer.\n- A new company launching a life meter.\n- A mass spectrometer would be the first way of doing it. Just take-\n- No, no, no. But that's one of the\nmajor components of it. But I'm talking about like, what if it's a device, and branding, logo, we gotta talk through that. That's later. But what's the input? Like how do you get to a metered output? - So, I would take my life\nmeter, our life meter. There you go.\n- Thank you. - Yeah, you're welcome. Would have both infrared and mass spec. So it would have two ports, so we could shine the light. And so what it would do is you\nwould have a vacuum chamber, and you would have an\nelectrostatic analyzer, and you'd have a monochromator\nto producing infrared. So you'd take a scoop of the sample, put it in the life meter. It would then add a solvent\nor heat up the sample so some volatiles come off. The volatiles would then be put into the mass spectrometer into the electrostatic trap, and you'd weigh the\nmolecules and fragment them. Alternatively, you'd shine\ninfrared light on them and count the number of bands. But you'd have to, in that case, do some separation, 'cause you want to separate in- And so, in mass spec, it's really nice and convenient 'cause you can separate electrostatically, but you need to have that. - Can you do it in real time? - Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, so let's go all the way back. Okay, we really gonna get\nthe Lex and Lee's life meter. - Oh yeah, Lex and Lee. It's good ring to it. - All right, so you have a vacuum chamber, you have a little nose. The nose would have a packing material. So you would take your sample, add it onto the nose,\nadd a solvent or a gas. It would then be sucked up the nose and that would separated using\nwhat we call chromatography. And then, as each band comes off the nose, we'll then do mass spec and infrared. And in the case of the infrared, count the number of bands. In the case of mass spec, count the number of\nfragments and weigh it. And then, the further up\nin molecular weight range for the mass spec and the number of bands, you go up and up and\nup from the, you know, dead, interesting, interesting,\nover the threshold, oh my gosh, earth life. And then right up to the batshit crazy, this is definitely, you know, alien intelligence that's\nmade this life, right? You could almost go all the way there. Same with the infrared. And it's pretty simple. The thing that is really problematical is that for many years, decades, what people have done,\nand I can't blame them, is they've rather been\nobsessing about small biomarkers that we find on earth, amino acids, like single amino acids or evidence of small molecules and these things, and looking for those rather\nthat looking for complexity. The beautiful thing about\nthis is you can look for complexity without\nearth chemistry bias or earth biology bias. So assembly theory is\njust a way of saying, hey, complexity in abundance\nis evidence of selection, that's how our universal\nlife media will work. - Complexity in abundance\nis evidence of selection. Okay, so let's apply\nour life meter to earth. You know, if we were just to apply assembly index\nmeasurements to earth, what kinda stuff are we going to get? What's impressive about some\nof the complexity on earth? - So we did this a few years ago when I was trying to\nconvince NASA and colleagues that this technique could work. And honestly, it's so funny\nbecause everyone's like, \"No, ain't gonna work.\" Because a chemist was saying, \"Of course there are\ncomplicated molecules out there you can detect that just from randomly.\" And I was like, \"Really?\" That's a bit like, I don't know, someone saying of course Darwin's textbook was just written randomly by\nsome monkeys and a typewriter. Just for me it was like, really? And I pushed a lot on the chemists now, and I think most of them are on board, but not totally. I really had some big arguments. But the copy number caught there, 'cause I think I confused\nthe chemist by saying, \"one-off,\" and then when I made it clear about the copy number, I think that made it a little bit easier. - Just to clarify, a chemist might say that, of course, out there, outside of earth, there's complex molecules? - Yes.\n- Okay. And then you're saying, \"Wait a minute, that's like saying of course there are aliens out there?\" - [Lee] Yeah, exactly that. - Okay, but you clarify\nthat that's actually a very interesting question and we should be looking\nfor complex molecules of which the copy number\nis two or greater. - Yeah, exactly. So on earth, to coming back to earth, what we did is we took\na whole bunch of samples and we were running prebiotic\nchemistry experiments in the lab. We took various inorganic minerals and extracted them, look at the volatile, because there's a special\nway of treating minerals and polymers in assembly theory. In our life machine,\nwe're looking molecules. We don't care about polymers\nbecause they're not volatile, you can't hold them. If you can't discern\nthat they're identical, then it's very difficult\nfor you to work out if there's undergone selection or they're just a random mess. Same with some minerals, but we can come back to that. So basically, what you do, we got a whole loads of samples. In organic ones, we've got scotch whiskey, and also took a Ardbeg, which is one of my favorite whiskeys, which is very peaty, and another-. - [Lex] What does peaty mean? In Scotland in Islay, which is a island, the whiskey is led to mature in barrels. And it's said that the peat, the complex molecules in the peat, might find their way\nthrough into the whiskey. And that's what gives it\nthis intense brown color and really complex flavor. It's literally molecular\ncomplexity that does that. And so, you know, vulc\nis the complete opposite. It's just pure, right? - [Lex] So the better the whiskey, the higher the assembly index, or the higher assembly index,\nthe better the whiskey. - That's what I mean. I really love the deep,\npeaty Scottish whiskeys. Near my house, there is one of the lowland distilleries\ncalled Glengoyne. It's still beautiful\nwhiskey but not as complex. So for fun, I took some\nGlengoyne whiskey in our bag and put them into the mass spec and measured the assembly index. I also got E. coli. So, the way we do it, take the E. Coli, break the cell apart, take it all apart. And also got some beer. And people were ridiculing us, saying that, \"Oh, beer is\nevidence of complexity.\" One of the computational complexity people who was just throwing- Kind of, he's very vigorous in his disagreement of assembly theory. He was he just saying, you know, \"You don't know what you're doing. Even beer is more complicated than human.\" What he didn't realize is\nthat it's not beer per se, it's taking the yeast\nextract, taking the extract, breaking the cells,\nextracting the molecules, and just looking at the\nprofile of the molecules, see if there's anything\nover the threshold. And we also put in a really\ncomplex molecule, Taxol. So we took all of these, but also NASA gave us, I think, five samples, and they\nwouldn't tell us what they are. They said, \"No, we don't believe you can get this to work.\" And they really, you know, they gave us some super complex samples. And they gave us two fossils. One that was a million years old and one was at 10,000 years old, something from Antarctica's seabed. They gave us some immerses and\nmeteorite and a few others. Put them through the system. So we took all the samples, treated them all identically, put them into mass spec, fragmented them. And in this case, implicit in the measurement was- In mass spec, you only detect peaks when you've got more than, let's say, 10,000 identical molecules. So the copy number's already baked in but wasn't quantified, which is super important there. That was in the first paper, 'cause I was like, \"it's\nabundant, of course.\" And when he then took it all out, we found that the biological samples gave you molecules that had an assembly index greater than 15. And all the abiotic\nsamples were less than 15. And then we took the NASA samples, and we looked at the\nones with more than 15 and less than 15, and we gave them back to NASA. And like, \"Oh gosh. Yep, dead, living, dead, living. You got it.\" And that's what we found on earth. - [Lex] So that's a success? - Yeah, a resounding success. - Well, can you just go back\nto the beer and the E. Coli? So what's the assembly index on those? - So what you were able to do is like, we found high assembly\nindex molecules originating from the beer sample\nand the E. coli sample. - [Lex] So the yeast and the beer. - I mean though, I didn't\nknow which one was higher. We didn't really do any detail there because now we are doing that."

      "section": "Evolution of life on Earth",
      "text": "Because one of the things we've done, it's a secret, but I\ncan tell you. (laughing) - Nobody's listening. - Well, is that we've just mapped the tree of life using assembly theory, 'cause everyone said that you\ncan't do anything in biology. And what we're able to do is, I think there's two ways\nof doing tree of life- Well, three ways, actually. - Yeah, what's the tree of life? - So the tree of life is\nbasically tracing back the history of life on earth for all the different species going back, who evolved from what, and it all goes all the way back to the first kind of life\nforms, and they branch off. And like, you have plant kingdom, the animal kingdom, the fungi kingdom, you know, and different\nbranches all the way up. And the way this was classically done. And I'm no evolutionary biologist. The evolutionary biologists\ntell me every day, at least 10 times. I want to be one though. I kinda like biology, it's kinda cool. - [Lex] Yeah, it's very cool. It's evolutionary.\n- But basically what Darwin, and Mendel, and all of these people do, it's just they draw pictures, right? And they text though. They were able to draw pictures and say, \"Oh, these look like common classes.\" - Yeah. They're artists, really,\nthey're just, you know? - But they we're able to\nfind out a lot, right, in looking at vibrates and vibrates, Cambrian explosion and all this stuff. And then came the genomic revolution, and suddenly everyone\nused gene sequencing. And Craig Venter is a good example. I think he's gone around\nthe world in his yacht just taking up samples\nlooking for new species, where he's just found new species of life just from sequencing. It's amazing. So you have taxonomy,\nand you have sequencing, and then you can also do a little bit of kind of molecular\nkind of archeology like, you know, measure the samples and kind of form some inference. What we did is we were\nable to fingerprint. We took a load of random\nsamples from all of biology, and we used mass spectrometry. And what we did now is not just look for individual molecules but we looked for coexisting molecules where they had to look at\ntheir joint assembly space, where we were able to cut them apart and undergo recursion in the mass spec and infer some relationships. And we were able to recapitulate the tree of life using mass spectroscopy, no sequencing and no drawing. - All right, can you try to say that again with a little more detail? So, recreating. What does it take to\nrecreate the tree of life? What does the reverse engineering\nprocess look like here? - So what you do is you\ntake an unknown sample, you bung it into the mass spec. 'Cause this comes from what you're asking, like, what do you see in E. coli? And so in E. Coli, it's not that the most sophisticated cells on earth make the most\nsophisticated molecules. It is the coexistence of lots of complex molecules above a threshold. And so what we realize\nis you could fingerprint different life forms. So fungi make really\ncomplicated molecules. Why? 'Cause they can't move. They have to make everything on site. Whereas, you know, some\nanimals are like lazy. They can just go eat the fungi and they don't need to make very much. And so what you do is, so you take, I don't\nknow, the fingerprint, maybe the top number of high\nmolecular weight molecules you find in the sample, you fragment them to get\ntheir assembly indices, and then what you can do is you can infer common origins of molecules. When the reverse engineering\nof the assembly space, you can infer common roots and look at what's called\nthe joint assembly space. But let's translate that\ninto the experiment. Take a sample, bung it in the mass spec, take the top say 10\nmolecules, fragment them, and that gives you one fingerprint. Then you do it for another sample, you get another fingerprint. Now the question is you say, hey, are these samples\nthe same or different? And that's what we've been able to do. And by basically looking\nat the assembly space that these molecules create. Without any knowledge of assembly theory, you are unable to do it. With the knowledge of assembly theory, you can reconstruct the tree. - How does knowing if\nthey're the same or different give you the tree? - Let's go to two leaves on different branches on the tree, right? What you can do, by counting\nthe number of differences, you can estimate how far\naway their origin was. - Got it.\n- And that's all we do. And it just works. But when we realized you\ncould even use assembly theory to recapitulate the tree of\nlife with no gene sequencing, we were like, \"huh.\" - So this is looking at samples that exist today in the world. What about like things\nthat no longer exist? I mean, the tree contains\ninformation about the past. Some of it is gone. - Yeah, absolutely. I would love to get old fossil samples and apply assembly theory mass spec and see if we can find new forms of life. They are no longer\namenable to gene sequencing 'cause the DNA is all gone. 'Cause DNA and RNA is quite unstable, but some of them are complex molecules. It might be there, it\nmight give you a hint of something new. Or, wouldn't it be great\nif you find a sample that's worth really persevering and doing, you know, doing the proper extraction to, you know, PCR and so on, and then sequence it, and then put it together. - So when a thing dies, you can still get some\ninformation about its complexity. - Yeah. And it appears that\nyou can do some dating. Now, there are really good techniques. There's radiocarbon dating. There is longer dating, going and looking at\nradioactive minerals and so on. And you can also, in bone, you can look at the- What happens after something dies, you get what's called racemization, where the chirality in the\npolymers basically changes and you get decomposition. And the rate of the deviation\nfrom the pure enantiomer to the mixture, it gives you\na timescale on it, half-life, so you can date when it died. I wanna use assembly theory\nto see if I can use it and date death and things, and trace the tree of life, and also decomposition of molecules. - [Lex] Do you think it's possible? - Oh yeah. Without a doubt. It may not be better. 'Cause like, I was just at a conference where some brilliant people were looking at isotope enrichment and looking at how life enriches isotopes, and there are really sophisticated\nstuff that they're doing. But I think there's some\nfun to be had there, because it gives you another dimension of dating how old is this\nmolecule in terms of- Or, more importantly, how long ago was this\nmolecule produced by life? The more complex the molecule, the more prospect for decomposition, oxidation, reorganization,\nloss of chirality and all that jazz. But what life also does is it enriches, as you get older, the\nthe amount of carbon 13 in you goes up because\nof the way the bonding is in carbon 13. So it has a slightly different\nbond strength than you, it's called the kinetic isotope effect. So you can literally date\nhow old you are, you know, or when you stop metabolizing. So you could date someone\nhow old they are, I think. I'm making this up, this might be right, but I think it's roughly right. The amount of carbon 13 you have in you, you can kind of estimate how old you are. - How old living humans\nare or living organisms? - Yeah, like you could say, oh, this person is 10 years old, and this person 30 years old because they've been\nmetabolizing more carbon, and they've accumulated it. That's the basic idea. It's probably a completely\nwrong timescale but- - Signatures of chemistry are fascinating."

      "text": "So you've been saying a\nlot of chemistry examples for assembly theory. What if we zoom out and look\nat a bigger scale of an object, you know, like really complex objects, like humans or living organisms that are made up of, you know, millions or billions of other organisms? How do you try to apply\nassembly theory to that? - At the moment, we should be able to do\nthis to morphology in cells. So we're looking at cell surfaces. And really, I'm trying to extend further. It's just that, you know, we work so hard to get this paper out and people to start discussing the ideas. But it's kinda funny, because I think the\npenny is falling on this. - What's it mean for\na penny to be falling? - I mean, the penny's dropped, right? 'Cause a lotta people were like, \"it's rubbish, it's rubbish. You've insulted me. It's wrong.\" And, you know, I mean\nthe paper got published on the 4th of October. It had 2.3 million\nengagements on Twitter, right? And it's been downloaded over\na few hundred thousand times. And someone actually said to me, wrote to me and said, \"This is an example of\nreally bad writing,\" and what not to do. And I was like, if all of my papers got read this much, 'cause that's the objective. If I have a publishing, a paper, I want people to read it. I wanna write that badly again. - Yeah. I don't know what's the deep insight here about the negativity in the space. I think it's probably the immune system of the scientific community making sure that there's no bullshit\nthat gets published. And that it can overfire, it can do a lot of damage, it can shut down conversations in a way that's not productive. - I mean, I'll answer your question about the hierarchy in assembly, but let's go back to the perception, people saying the paper was badly written. I mean, of course we could improve it. We could always improve the clarity. - Let's go there before\nwe go to the hierarchy. You know, it has been criticized\nquite a bit, the paper. What has been some criticism\nthat you found most powerful, like, that you can understand\nand can you explain it? - Yes. The most exciting criticism came from the evolutionary biologist, telling me that they thought that origin of life was a solved problem. And I was like, whoa,\nwe're really onto something because it's clearly not. And then when you poked them on that, they just said, \"No, you\ndon't understand evolution.\" And I said, \"No, no, I don't think you\nunderstand that evolution had to occur before\nbiology and there's a gap.\" For me, that misunderstanding, and that did cause an immune response which was really interesting. The second thing was the\nfact that physicists- Well, the physicists were\nactually really polite, right? And really nice about it. But they just said, \"Huh, we're not really sure about the initial conditions thing.\" But this is a really big debate that we should certainly get into because you know the emergence of life was not encoded in the initial\nconditions of the universe. And I think assembly theory\nshows why it can't be. - Okay, sure. If you could say that again. - The the emergence of life was not and cannot in principle be encoded in the initial\nconditions of the universe. - Just to clarify what you\nmean by life is like what? High assembly index objects? - Yeah. And this goes back to\nyour favorite subject. - What's that?\n- Time. (both chuckling) - Right, so why? What does time have to do with it? - I mean, probably we\ncan come back to it later if we have time. I think I now understand\nhow to explain how- You know, lots of people got angry with the assembly paper, but also the ramifications of this is how time is fundamental in the universe and this notion of combinatorial spaces. And there are so many layers on this, but I think you have to become\nan intuitionist mathematician and you have to abandon\nplatonic mathematics. And also, platonic mathematics\nhas left physics astray. But there's a lot unpack there. So we can go to the- - Platonic mathematics. Okay. The evolutionary biologists criticize it because the origin of life is understood and it doesn't require an explanation that involves physics. - Yeah.\n- That's their statement. - Well, I mean, they said\nlots of confusing statements. Basically, I realized the\nevolutionary biology community that were vocal, and some\nof them were really rude, really spiteful and needlessly so, right? Because look, you know, people misunderstand publication as well. Some of the people has said, \"How dare this be published in nature? This is, you know, what\na terrible journal.\" And I said to people, \"Look, this is this is a brand new idea that's not only\npotentially going to change the way we look at biology, it's gonna change the way\nwe look at the universe.\" And everyone's, like, saying, \"How dare you? How dare you be so grandiose?\" I'm like, \"No, no, no, this is not hype.\" We're not like saying we've invented some, I don't know, we've discovered a alien in a closet somewhere just for hype. We genuinely mean this to\ngenuinely have the impact or ask the question. And the way people jumped on that was a really bad\nprecedent for young people who wanna actually do something new because this makes a bold claim. And the chances are that it's not correct. But what I wanted to do\nis a couple of things. Is I wanted to make a bold claim that was precise and\ntestable and correctable. Not another wooly information\nin biology argument, information Turing machine,\nblah, blah, blah, blah, blah. A concrete series of statements that can be falsified and explored, and either the theory could\nbe destroyed or built upon. - Well, what about the criticism of you're just putting\na bunch of sexy names on something that's already obvious? - Yeah, that's really good. So the assembly index of\na molecule is not obvious. No one had measure it before. And no one has thought to\nquantify selection complexity and copy number before in such\na primitive quantifiable way. I think the nice thing about this paper, this paper is a tribute to all the people that understand that biology does something very interesting. Some people call it negentropy, some people call it, think about, you know, organizational principles. Lots of people were not\nshocked by the paper because they'd done it before. A lot of the arguments we got, some people said, \"Oh, it's rubbish. Oh, by the way, I had this\nidea 20 years before.\" I was like, \"Which one?\" The rubbish part or the\nreally revolutionary part? So this kind of plucks\ntwo strings at once. It plucked the there is\nsomething interesting the biologies are, as\nwe can see around us, but we haven't quantified yet. And what this is, is the first\nstab at quantifying that. So the fact that people\nsaid this is obvious but it's also- So if it's obvious, why\nhave you not done it? - Sure, but there's a\nfew things to say there. One is, you know, this is in part a philosophical framework\nbecause, you know, it's not like you can apply this generally to any object in the universe. It's very chemistry focused. - Yeah, well, I think you will be able to, we just haven't got there robustly. So if we can say how can we- Let's go up a level. So if we go up from a level, let's go up from molecules to cells, 'cause you would jump to people and I jump to emoticons, and both were good and\nthey will be assembly. - [Lex] Yeah, let's stick with cells. Yeah, good point. - So if we go from\nmolecules to assemblies, and let's take a cellular assembly. A nice thing about a cell is you can tell the\ndifference between a eukaryote and a prokaryote, right? The organelle are specialized differently. We then look at the cell surface, and the cell surface has\ndifferent glycosylation patterns and these cells will stick together. Now let's go up a level. In multicellular creatures, you have cellular differentiation. Now if you think about\nhow embryos develop, you go all the way back, those cells undergo differentiation on a causal way that's biomechanically a feedback between the\ngenetics and biomechanics. I think we can use assembly theory to apply to tissue types. We can even apply it to\ndifferent cell disease types. So that's what we're doing next, but we are trying to walk. You know, the thing is, I wanna leap ahead to go, well, we'll apply it to culture. But clearly, you can apply\nit to memes and culture. And we've also applied assembly theory to CAs, and not as you think. - [Lex] Cellular automata, by the way. - Yeah, yeah, to cellular automaton, not just as you think. Different CA rules were\ninvented by different people at different times. And one of my coworkers, a very talented chap, basically was like, \"Oh, I can realize that different people had different ideas with different rules, and they copied each other and made slightly different\ncellular automaton rules, and they looked at them online.\" And so he was able to\naffirm an assembly index and copy number of rule\nwhatever doing this thing. But I digress. But it does show you can\napply it at a higher scale. So what do we need to do to\napply assembly theory to things? We need to agree there's a\ncommon set of building blocks. Well, in a multicellular creature, you need to look back in time. So there is the initial cell, which a creature is fertilized\nand then starts to grow, and then there is cell differentiation. And you have to then make that\ncausal chain both on those. So that requires development\nof the organism in time. Or if you look at the cell\nsurfaces and the cell types, they've got different features on the cell walls and inside the cell. So we're building up. But obviously, I wanna leap\nto things like emoticons, language, mathematical theorems. - Yeah, but that's a very\nlarge number of steps to get from a molecule to the human brain. - Yeah, and I think they are related but in hierarchies of emergence, right? So you shouldn't compare them. I mean, the assembly\nindex of a human brain, what does that even mean? Well, maybe we can look at the morphology of the human brain. Say all human brains have these number of features in common. And then let's look at a brain in a whale or a dolphin or a chimpanzee\nor a bird and say, okay, let's look at the\nassembly indices number of features in these. And now the copy number is just a number of how many birds are there, how many chimpanzees are there, how many humans are there? - But then you have to discover for the features that\nyou would be looking for. - Yeah, and that means\nyou need to have some idea of the anatomy. - But there's an automated\nway to discover features? - I guess so. I mean, and I think this is a good way to apply machine learning\nand image recognition just to basically characterize things. - To apply compression\nto it to see what emerges and then use the thing. The features used as\npart of the compression as the thing that is searched for when you're measuring assembly\nindex and copy number. - And the compression has to be remember the assembly universe, which is you have to go\nfrom assembly possible to assembly contingent. 'Cause assembly possible\nor possible brains or possible features all the time. But we know that on the tree of life, and also on the lineage of\nlife, going back to LUCA, the human brain just didn't\nspring into existence yesterday, it is a long lineage of\nbrains going all the way back. And so, if we could do assembly theory to understand the development, not just in evolutionary history but in biological development as you grow, we are gonna learn something more. - What would be amazing is if\nyou can use assembly theory, this framework, to show the increase in the assembly index associated with, I don't know, cultures or pieces of text like language or images and so on, and illustrate without knowing\nthe data ahead of time, just kinda like you did with NASA, that you were able to demonstrate that it applies in those other contexts. I mean, and that, you know,\nprobably wouldn't at first and you have to evolve the theory somehow. You have to change it, you\nhave to expand it, you know? - [Lee] I think so. - But like that. I guess this is, as a paper, a first step in saying, okay, can we create a general framework for measuring complexity of\nobjects, for measuring life, the complexity of living organisms. - [Lee] Yeah. - That's what this is reaching for. - That is the first step. And also to say, look, we have a way of quantifying selection and evolution in a fairly, not mundane, but a fairly mechanical way. Because before now, you know, the ground truth for\nit was very subjective. Whereas here, we're talking\nabout clean observables. And there's gonna be layers on that. I mean, with collaborators right now, we already think we can do\nassembly theory on language. And not only that. Wouldn't it be great if we can figure out how under pressure\nlanguage is gonna evolve and be more efficient, 'cause you're gonna wanna transmit things. And again, it's not\njust about compression, it is about understanding how you can make the most of the architecture\nyou've already built. And I think this is something beautiful that evolution does. We're reusing those architectures. We can't just abandon\nour evolutionary history. And if you don't wanna abandon\nyour evolutionary history, and you know that evolution\nhas been happening, then assembly theory works. And I think that's the\nkey comment I wanna make, is that assembly theory\nis great for understanding when evolution has been used. The next jump is when we go to technology. 'Cause of course, if you\ntake the M3 processor. I haven't bought one yet, I can't justify it, but\nI want to at some point. The M3 processor arguably, there's quite a lot of features and quite large number. The M2 came before it, then the M1, all the way back. You can apply assembly theory to microprocessor architecture. It doesn't take a huge leap to see that. - I'm a Linux guy, by the way, so your examples go away over my head. - [Lee] Yeah, well, whatever. - Is that a fruit company of some sort? I don't even know. Yeah, there's a lotta interesting stuff to ask about language. Like you could look at- How would that work? You could look at GPT-1,\nGPT-2, GPT-3, 3.5, 4 and try to analyze the kind\nof language it produces. I mean, that's almost trying\nto look at assembly index of intelligent systems. - Yeah, I mean, I think the thing about large language models, and this is a whole hobby\nhorse I have at the moment, is that obviously they're all about- The evidence of evolution\nin the large language model comes from all the people that\nproduced all the language. And that's really interesting. And all the corrections in\nthe Mechanical Turk, right? - [Lex] Sure. - And so-\n- But that's the part of the history, part of\nthe memory of the system. - Exactly. So it would be really\ninteresting to basically use an assembly-based approach\nto making language in a hierarchy, right? My guess is that we might\nbe able to build a new type of large language model\nthat uses assembly theory that it has more understanding of the past and how things were created. Where basically, with a thing with LLMs is they're like everything\neverywhere all at once, splat, and make the user happy. So there's not much\nintelligence in the model. The model is how the human\ninteracts with the model. But wouldn't it be great\nif we could understand how to embed more\nintelligence in the system? - What do you mean by intelligence there? Like you seem to associate intelligence with history and memory. - I think selection produces intelligence. - Wait, what? You're almost implying that\nselection is intelligence. No.\n- Yeah, kind of. I would go out and limb and say that. But I think it's a little bit more. Human beings have the ability to abstract and they can break beyond selection. Darwinian selection. Because a human being\ndoesn't have to basically do trial and error. Like they can think about it and say, oh, that's a\nbad idea, won't do that. And then technologies and so on. - So we escaped Darwinian evolution and now we're onto some other\nkind of evolution I guess? - Yeah.\n- Higher level evolution. - And the assembly theory will\nmeasure that as well, right? Because it's all a lineage."

      "section": "Kolmogorov complexity",
      "text": "- Okay, another piece of criticism, or by way of question is, how's assembly theory\nor maybe assembly index different from Kolmogorov complexity? So for people who don't know, a Kolmogorov complexity of an object is the length of a\nshortest computer program that produces the object as output. - Yeah, there seems to be a disconnect between the computational\napproach, so yeah. So a Kolmogorov measure requires a Turing machine, requires a computer. And that's one thing. And the other thing is assembly theory is supposed to trace the process by which life evolution emerged, right? There's a main thing there. There are lots of other layers. So Kolmogorov complexity, you can you can approximate\nKolmogorov complexity but it's not really telling you very much about the actual- It's really telling you about like, your compression of your dataset. And so, that doesn't really\nhelp you identify the turtle, in this case is the computer. And so what assembly theory does is, I'm gonna say, (chuckles) there's a trigger warning\nfor anyone listening who loves complexity theory. I think that we're gonna show that AIT is a very important\nsubset of assembly theory, because here's what happens. I think that assembly theory allows us to understand when were\nselections occurring, selection produces factories and things, factories in the end produce computers, then algorithmic information\ntheory comes out of that. The frustration I've\nhad with looking at life through this kind of information theory is it doesn't take into account causation. So the main difference\nbetween assembly theory and all these complexity measures is there's no causal chain. And I think that's the main- - That's the causal chains at\nthe core of assembly theory. - Exactly. And if you've got all your\ndata in a computer memory, all the data's the same. You can access it in the same type of way, you don't care, you just compress it, and you either look at the program runtime or the shortest program. And that for me is\nabsolutely not capturing what its selection does. - But Assembly theory looks at objects, it doesn't have information\nabout the object history. It's going to try to infer that history by looking for the\nshortest history, right? The object doesn't like\nhave a Wikipedia page that goes with it about its history. - I would I would say it does in a way, and it is fascinating to look at. So you've just got the object and you have no other\ninformation about the object. What assembly theory allows you to do just with the object is to- And the word infer is\ncorrect, I agree with infer. So it's, you know, like say\nwell that's not the history, but something really\ninteresting comes from this. The shortest path is\ninferred from the object. That is the worst case\nscenario if you have no machine to make it. So that tells you about the\ndepth of that object in time. And so, what assembly\ntheory allows you to do is, without considering any\nother circumstances, to say from this object how\ndeep is this object in time if we just treat the object as itself without any other constraints. And that's super powerful because the shortest path then allows you to say, oh, this object\nwasn't just created randomly, there was a process. And so, assembly theory\nis not meant to, you know, one up AIT or to ignore the factory. It's just to say, hey,\nthere was a factory, and how big was that factory\nand how deep in time is it? - But it's still\ncomputationally very difficult to compute that history, right? For complex objects. - It is. It becomes harder. But one of the things that's super nice is that it constrains your\ninitial conditions, right? It constrains where you're gonna be. So one of the things we're doing right now is applying assembly\ntheory to drug discovery. Now what everyone's doing right now is taking all the proteins\nand looking at the proteins and looking at molecules not the proteins. Why not instead look at the molecules that are involved in interacting with the receptors over time, rather thinking about and use\nthe molecules evolve over time as a proxy for how the\nproteins evolved over time., and then use that to constrain\nyour drug discovery process. You flip the problem 180 and focus on the molecule evolution\nrather than the protein. And so you can guess in the\nfuture what might happen. So you rather than having to consider all possible molecules, you know where to focus. And that's the same\nthing if you're looking in assembly spaces for an object where you don't know the entire history but you know in the history of this object it's not gonna have some other motif there that doesn't appear in the past. - But just even for the drug\ndiscovery point you made, don't you have to\nsimulate all of chemistry to figure out how to\ncome up with constraints through the molecules and- - No.\n- I don't I don't know enough about producing. - This is another thing\nthat I think causes- 'Cause this paper goes\nacross so many boundaries. So chemists have looked at this and said this is not correct reaction. It's like, no, it's a graph. (laughing) - Sure, there's a assembly index and shortest path examples\nhere on chemistry. - Yeah. And what you do is you look\nat the minimal constraints on that graph. Of course it has some\nmapping to the synthesis, but actually you don't have\nto know all of chemistry, you can build up the\nconstraints space rather nicely. But this is just at the beginning, right? There are so many\ndirections this could go. And I said, it could all be wrong but hopefully it's less wrong. - What about the little\ncriticism I saw of do you- By way of question, do you consider the\ndifferent probabilities of each reaction in the chain? So like, that there could be different- When you look at a chain of events that led up to the creation of an object, doesn't it matter that\nsome parts in the chain are less likely than others? - No - It doesn't matter.\n- No, no. Well, let's go back. So, no not less likely, but it reacts so- So, no. So let's go back to what\nwe're looking at here. So the assembly index is the minimal path that could have created that\nobject probabilistically. So imagine you have all\nyour atoms in the plasma, you got enough energy, there's collisions. What is the quickest way you\ncould zip out that molecule with no reaction constraints? - How do you define quickest there then? - It's just basically a\nwalk on a random graph. So we make an assumption that basically the timescale for forming the bonds. So, no, I don't wanna say that because then it's gonna have\npeople getting obsessing about this point, and your\ncriticism is a really good one. What we're trying to say is like this puts a lower bound on something. Of course, some reactions are\nless possible than others. But actually, I don't think\nchemical reactions exist. - Oh, boy. What does that mean? Why don't chemical reactions exist? - I'm writing a paper right now that I keep being told I have to finish, and it's called \"The Origin\nof Chemical Reactions\". And it merely says that reactivity exists, as controlled by the laws\nof quantum mechanics, and reactions, chemists\nput names on reactions, you could have like, I don't know, the Wittig reaction, which\nis by, you know, Wittig. You could have the Suzuki\nreaction which is by Suzuki. Now what are these reactions? So these reactions are\nconstrained by the following. They're constrained by the fact they're on planet earth, 1G,\n298 kelvin, and one bar. So these are constraints. They're also constrained by the chemical composition of earth. Oxygen, availability, all this stuff. And that then allows us\nto focus on our chemistry. So when a chemist does a reaction, that's a really nice compressed shorthand for constraint application. Glass flask, pure reagent, temperature pressure,\nboom, boom, boom, boom, control, control,\ncontrol, control, control. So of course, we have bond energies. So the bond energies are kind\nof intrinsic in a vacuum. So the bond energy. You have to have a bond. And so, for assembly theory to work, you have to have a bond, which means that bond\nhas to give the molecule a certain half-life. So you're probably gonna find later on that some bonds are weaker. When you look at the\nassembly of some molecules, you're gonna miscount the\nassembly of the molecule 'cause it falls apart too quickly, 'cause the bonds just form. But you can solve that\nwith looking at infrared. So when people think\nabout the probability, they're kinda misunderstanding. Assembly theory says\nnothing about the chemistry because chemistry is chemistry and their constraints\nare put in by biology. There was no chemist\nat the origin of life, unless you believe in\nthe chemist in the sky and they were, you know,\nit's like Santa Claus, they had a lot of work to do. But chemical reactions do not exist, the constraints that allow\nchemical transformations to occur do exist. - Okay, okay. So there's no chemical reactions, it's all constraint application which enables the emergence of- What's a different word\nfor chemical reaction? - Transformation.\n- Transformation. - [Lee] Yeah, like a function. It's a function.\n- Yeah. But no, but I love chemical\nreactions as a shorthand and so the chemists don't all go mad. I mean, of course chemical\nreactions exist on earth. - It's a shorthand\n- It's a shorthand for these constraints. - Right. So assuming all these\nconstraints that we've been using for so long that we just assume\nthat that's always the case, in natural language conversation. - Exactly. The grammar of chemistry of\ncourse emerges in reactions and we can use 'em reliably. But I do not think the Wittig reaction is accessible on Venus. - Right, and this is useful\nto remember, you know, to frame it as constraint\napplication is useful for when you zoom out\nto the bigger picture of the universe and\nlooking at the chemistry of the universe and then starting\nto apply assembly theory. - Yeah.\n- That's interesting. That's really interesting. (chuckles) Well, we've also\npissed off the chemist now. - Oh, I expect they're pretty happy, well most of them. (laughing) - Everybody deep down is happy, I think. They're just sometimes feisty, that's how they have fun. - Everyone is grumpy on some days when- The problem with this paper is you- I used to do this\noccasionally when I was young. Go to a meeting and just\nfind a way to offend everyone at the meeting simultaneously. Even the factions that\ndon't like each other, they're all unified in their hatred of you just offending them. This paper, it feels\nlike the person that went to the party and offended\neveryone simultaneously, so they stop fighting with themselves and just focused on this paper."

      "section": "Nature review process",
      "text": "- Maybe just a little insider\ninteresting information. What were the editors of \"Nature\", their reviews and so on, how difficult was that process? 'Cause this is a pretty, like, big paper. - When we originally sent the paper, we sent the paper, and the\neditor said that, you know- This was quite a long process. We sent the paper, and the\neditor gave us some feedback and said, \"You know, I don't think it's that interesting.\" Or, \"It's a hard concept.\" And the editor gave us some feedback, and Sara and I took a\nyear to rewrite the paper. - Was the nature of the\nfeedback very specific on like, this part or this part, or was it, like, what\nare you guys smoking? - Yeah, it was kind of the latter. What you smoking?\n- Okay. (Lee laughing) - But polite and there's promise. - Yeah, well, the thing is, the editor was really critical, but in a really professional way. And I mean, for me, this was\nthe way science should happen. So when it came back, you know, we had too many equations in the paper. If you look at the preprint, they're just equations everywhere, like there are 23 equations. And when I said to Abhishek, who was the first author, and we've gotta remove all the equations, but my assembly equation's staying. And Abhishek was like,\n\"You know, no, we can't.\" I said, \"Well, look, if we\nwant to explain this to people, there's a real challenge.\" And so Sara and I went through the, I think it was actually\n160 versions of the paper, but basically we got to\nversion 40 or something. We said, \"Right, zero, let's start again.\" So we wrote the whole paper again. We knew the entire archive.\n- Amazing. - And we just went bit\nby bit by bit and said, \"What is it we wanna say?\" And then we sent the paper in, and we expected it to be rejected and not even go to review. And then we got the notification back, it had gone to review, and we were like, \"Oh my God,\nit's so gonna get rejected. How's it gonna get rejected?\" 'Cause the first assembly paper on the mass spec we sent to \"Nature\" went through six rounds of\nreview and were rejected, right? And this by a chemist who just said, \"I don't believe you, you\nmust be committing fraud.\" And long story, probably a boring story. But in this case, it went out to review, the comments came back, and the comments were incredibly- No, they were very deep comments from all the reviewers. But the nice thing was\nthe reviewers were kind of very critical but not dismissive. They were like, \"Oh, really? Explain this. Explain this. Explain this. Explain this.\"\n- That's great. - \"Are you sure it's not Kolmogorov? Are you sure it's not this?\" And we went through, I think, three rounds of review pretty quick. And the editor went, \"Yeah, it's in.\" - But maybe you could just\ncomment on the whole process. You've published some pretty huge papers on all kinds of topics\nwithin chemistry and beyond. Some of them have some\nlittle spice in them, a little spice of crazy. Like Tom Waits says, \"I like my town with a\nlittle drop of poison.\" So, you know, it's not a mundane paper. So what's it like psychologically to go through all this process\nto keep getting rejected to get reviews from people\nthat don't get the paper or all that kind of stuff? Just from a question of a scientist, what is that like? - I mean, this paper, for me, kind of- 'Cause this wasn't the first time we tried to publish assembly theory\nat the highest level, the \"Nature\" communications\npaper on the mass spec on the idea went to\n\"Nature\" and got rejected. Look, it went through six rounds of review and got rejected. And I just was so confused\nwhen the chemist said, \"This can't be possible, I do not believe you\ncan measure complexity using mass spec. And also, by the way, complex molecules can randomly form.\" And we're like, \"But look at the data. The data says.\" And they said, \"No, no,\nwe don't believe you.\" I just wouldn't give up. (laughing) And the editor, in the end, different editors actually, right? - What's behind that never giving up? When you're sitting there\n10 o'clock in the evening, there's a melancholy\nfeeling that comes over you, and you're like, \"Okay, this\nis rejection number five.\" Or it's not rejection but\nmaybe it feels like a rejection because of the, you know, the comments are that you totally don't get it. Like what gives you strength\nto keep going there? - I don't know. I don't normally get\nemotional about papers. It's not about giving up because we wanna get it published, 'cause we\nwant the glory or anything. It's just like, why don't you understand? So why I would just try to\nbe as rational as possible and say, \"Yeah you didn't like it, tell me why?\" And then- Sorry. Silly.\n- And you part- - I never get emotional\nabout papers normally, but I think what we do is\nyou just compressed, like, five years of angst from this. - So it's been rough? - It's not just rough,\nit's like it happened. You know, I came up with\nthe assembly equation, you know, remote from Sara in Arizona and the people at SFI, I felt like I was a mad person, like, you know, the guy\ndepicted in \"A Beautiful Mind\". Not the actual genius part, but just the, gibberish, gibberish,\ngibberish. (laughing) Because I kept writing expanded. And I have no mathematical ability at all, and I was making these\nmathematical expansions where I kept seeing the same motif again. I was like, \"Oh, I think\nthis is a copy number.\" The same string is coming\nagain, again, again. I couldn't do the math. And then I realized the copy\nnumber fell outta the equation and everything collapsed down. I was like, \"Oh, that works, kind of.\" So we submitted the paper, and then when it was\nalmost accepted, right? The mass spec one. And there was astrobiologists,\nsaid, \"Great.\" you know, a mass\nspectroscopist said, \"Great,\" and the chemist went, \"Nonsense.\" Like, \"Biggest pile of nonsense\never, fraud,\" you know? And I was like, \"But why fraud?\" And they just said, \"Just because.\" And I was like, \"Well.\" And I could not convince\nthe editor in this case. The editor was just so off, 'cause they see it as like a kind of a, you know, you're wasting my time. And I would not give up. I wrote. I went and dissected,\nyou know, all the parts. And I think although, I mean, I got upset about it, you know, it was kind of embarrassing\nactually, but I guess- - [Lex] (speaks faintly) beautiful. - But it was just trying to understand why they didn't like it. So a part of me was\nlike really devastated. And a part of me was super excited, 'cause I'm like, \"Huh, they\ncan't tell me why I'm wrong.\" And this kinda goes back to, you know- When I was at school, I was in a kinda learning\ndifficulties class and I kept going to the teacher and say, you know, \"What do I\ndo today to prove I'm smart?\" And they were like, \"Nothing, you can't.\" I was like, \"Gimme a job,\" you know, \"gimme something to do. Gimme a job to do. Something just to do as we-\" And I kinda felt like that a bit when I was arguing with the- And not arguing, there\nwas no (indistinct), and I wasn't telling the\neditor they were idiots or anything like this, or the reviewers, I kept it strictly, like, factual. And all I did is I just\nkept knocking it down bit by bit by bit by bit by bit. It was ultimately rejected, and it got published though, elsewhere. And then, the actual experimental data. In this paper, the\nexperimental justification was already published. So when we did this one and\nwe went through the versions and then we sent it in, and in the end it just got accepted. We were like, \"Well,\nthat's kinda cool, right?\" The first author was like, \"I can't believe it got accepted.\" Like, nor am I, but it's great. It's like, it's good. And then when the paper was published, I was not expecting the backlash. I was expecting computational- Well, no actually, I was\njust expecting one person who'd been trolling me\nfor a while about it just to carry on trolling. But I didn't expect the backlash. And then, I wrote to the\neditor and apologized. And the editor was like,\n\"What are you apologizing for? It was a great paper. Of course it's gonna get backlash, you said some controversial\nstuff, but it's awesome.\" - Well, I think it's a\nbeautiful story of perseverance, and the backlash is just a\nnegative word for discourse, which I think is beautiful. That's the science. - You know, when it got accepted and people were saying we're\nkind of like hacking on it. I was like, \"Papers are not gold medals.\" The reason I wanted to publish that paper in \"Nature\" is because it says, \"Hey, there's something\nbefore biological evolution.\" You have to have that if you're not a creationist, by the way. This is an approach. First time someone has\nput a concrete mechanism, sorry, a concrete quantification. And what comes next, you're\npushing on, is a mechanism. And that's what we need to get to is an autocatalytic set,\nself-replicating molecules, some other features that come in. And the fact that this\npaper has been so discussed, for me, is a dream come true. Like, it doesn't get better than that. If you can't accept a\nfew people hating it. And the nice thing is, the thing that really makes me happy is that no one has attacked\nthe actual physical content. Like, you can measure the assembly index, you can measure selection now. Well, either that's helpful or unhelpful. If it's unhelpful, this\npaper will sink down and no one will use it again. If it's helpful, it'll help\npeople build a scaffold on it, and we'll start to\nconverge to a new paradigm. So I think that that's the\nthing that I wanted to see, you know, my colleagues,\nauthors, collaborators, and people were like, \"You've just published this\npaper, you're a chemist. Why have you done this? Like, who are you to be\ndoing evolutionary theory?\" Like, well, \"I dunno. I mean, sorry, did I need to-\" - Cause anyone to do anything. Well, I'm glad you did. Before coming back to origin of life and these kinds of questions, you mentioned learning difficulties. I didn't know about this. So what was it like? - I wasn't very good at school, right? - [Lex] This is when you were very young? - Yeah, yeah, in primary school. My handwriting was really poor, and apparently I couldn't read, and my mathematics was very poor. So they just said this is a problem, they identified it. My parents kind of at\nthe time were confused because I was busy taking things apart, buying electronic junk from the shop, trying to build computers and things. And then, when I was I think about- The major transition in my stupidity, like, you know, everyone thought I wasn't that stupid when I- Basically, everyone thought I was faking. I like stuff and I was\nfaking wanting to be- So I always wanted to be a scientist. So five, six, seven years old, be a scientist, take things apart. And everyone's like, \"Yeah, this guy wants to be a scientist, but he's an idiot.\" (laughing) So everyone was really confused, I think, at first, that I wasn't\nsmarter than I, you know, was claiming to be. And then I just basically didn't do well in any of the tests and I went down and\ndown and down and down. And I was kinda like, \"Huh, this is really embarrassing.\" I really like maths and\neveryone says I can't do it. I really like kind of, you know, physics and chemistry and science, and people say you can't read and write. And so, I found myself in a\nlearning difficulties class at the end of primary school and the beginning of secondary school. In the UK, secondary school\nis like 11, 12 years old. And I remember being put\nin the remedial class. And the remedial class\nwas basically full of, well, three types of people. There were people that had quite violent, right, you know?\n- Yeah. - And there were people\nwho couldn't speak English. And there were people that\nreally had learning difficulties. The one thing I can\nobjectively remember was- I mean, I could read. I like reading. I read a lot. I'm a bit of a rebel. I refused to read what I was told to read. And I found it difficult\nto read individual words in the way they were told. But anyway, so I got\ncaught one day teaching someone else to read. And they said, \"Okay, we\ndon't understand this.\" I always knew I wanted to be a scientist, but didn't really know what that meant. And I realized you had\nto go to university. And I thought I can just go to university, it's like curious people. Like, no, no, no, you need to have these, you have to be able to\nenter in these exams to get this grade point average. And the fact is the exams\nyou've been entered into, you're just gonna get C, D, or E. You can't even get A, B, or C, right? This is the UK GCSEs. I was like, \"Oh, shit.\" And I said, \"Can you just\nput me into the high exams?\" They said, \"No, no, you're gonna fail. There's no chance.\" So my father kind of intervened and said, you know, \"Just let him go in the exams.\" And they said, \"He's\ndefinitely gonna fail, it's a waste of time, waste of money.\" And he said, \"Well, what if we paid?\" So they said, \"Well, okay.\" So he didn't actually have to pay. He only had to pay if I failed. So I took the exams and\npassed them, fortunately. I didn't get the top grades but I, you know, I got into A levels. But then that also kind of limited what I could do at A levels. I wasn't allowed to do A-Level maths. - What do you mean you weren't allowed to? - Because I had such a bad\nmath grade from my GCSEs, I only had a C. But they wouldn't let me\ngo into the ABC for maths 'cause of some kind of\ncoursework requirement back then. The top grade I coulda got was a C. So C, D, or E. So I got a C. And they let me do kind of AS-level maths, which is this half intermediate, but I didn't get go university. But in the end I liked chemistry, I had a good chemistry teacher. So in the end, I got to\nuniversity to do chemistry. - So through that kind\nof process, I think, for kids in that situation, it's easy to start\nbelieving that you're not, well, how do I put it? That you're stupid, and basically give up. That you're just not good at math, you're not good at school. So this is by way of advice for people, for interesting people, for interesting young kids right now, experiencing the same thing. What was the source of\nyou not giving up there? - I have no idea other than I really liked not understanding stuff. For me, when I not understand something- (chuckles) I feel like I\ndon't understand anything now. But back then, I remember\nwhen I was like, I don't know. I tried to build a laser\nwhen I was, like, eight. And I thought, how hard could it be? And basically I was\ngonna build a CO2 laser. I was like, \"Right, I think I need some partially coated mirrors, I need some carbon dioxide, and I need a high voltage. And I was so stupid, right? I was kind of so embarrassed. I had to make enough CO2. I actually set a fire and\ntried to filter the flame- - Oh, nice.\n- To trap enough CO2. And I was like, it completely failed and I burnt half the the garage down. So my parents were not\nvery happy about that. So that was one thing. I was like, I really like\nfirst principle thinking, and so, you know? So I remember being super curious and being determined to find answers. And so, when people do\ngive advice about this, why I ask for advice about this, I don't really have that much advice other than don't give up. And one of the things I tried to do as a chemistry professor in my group, is I hire people that\nI think that, you know- If they're persistent enough, who am I to deny them the chance? Because, you know, people gave me a chance and I was able to do stuff. - Do you believe in yourself essentially? - So I love being around smart people and I love confusing smart people. And when I'm confusing smart people, and, you know, not by\nstealing their wallets and hiding it somewhere, but if I can confuse smart people, that is the one piece of hope that I might be doing\nsomething interesting. - Well, that's quite brilliant. Like as a gradient to optimize. Hang out with smart\npeople and confuse them. And the more confusing it is, the more there's something there. - And as long as they're not telling you you're just a complete idiot, and they give you different reasons. 'Cause like with assembly theory, when people said, \"Oh, it's wrong.\" And I was like, \"Why?\" And no one could gimme\na consistent reason. They said, \"Oh, because\nit's been done before,\" or \"it's just Kolmogorov,\" or \"it's just there, that, and the other.\" So I think the thing\nthat I like to do is in- And in academia, it's hard, right? 'Cause people are critical. But I mean, you know, the criticism- I mean, although I got kind\nof upset about it earlier, which is kind of silly, but not silly, because obviously it's\nhard work being on your own or with a team, spatially separated, like during lockdown, and\ntry to keep everyone on board and, you know, have some faith. I always wanted to have a new idea. And so, you know, I like a new idea and I wanna nurture it\nas long as possible. And if someone can give\nme actionable criticism. That's what I think I\nwas trying to say earlier when I was kind of like stuck for words. Give me actionable criticism. You know, it's wrong. Okay, why is it wrong? Say, oh, your equation's\nincorrect for this, or your method is wrong. And so what I try and do\nis get enough criticism from people to then\ntriangulate and go back. And I've been very fortunate in my life that I've got great colleagues, great collaborators, funders, mentors and people that will take the time to say, you're wrong because. And then what I have to do\nis integrate the wrongness and go, aah, cool, maybe I can fix that. And I think criticism is really good. People have a go at me\n'cause I'm really critical. I'm like, But I'm not criticizing, you know, you as a person, I'm just criticizing the idea and trying to make it better and say, \"Well, what about\nthis,\" and, you know? And sometimes I'm kind of, you know, my filters are kind of,\nyou know, truncated. And in some ways, I'm just like, \"That's wrong, that's wrong, that's wrong, why'd you do this?\" And people are like, \"Oh\nmy God, you just told me. You destroyed my life's work.\" I'm like, \"Relax, no.\" I'm just like, \"Let's make it better.\" And I think that we don't do that enough 'cause we're either personally critical, which isn't helpful, or we don't give any criticism at all because we're too scared. - Yeah. I've seen you be pretty\naggressively critical, but every time I've seen it, it's the idea, not the person. - I'm sure I make mistakes and that. I mean, you know, I argue with lots- I mean, I argue lots with Sara, and she was like kinda shocked. I've argued with Joscha\nin the past, Joscha Bach, and he's like, \"You're\njust making that up.\" I'm like, \"No, not quite, but kind of.\""

      "text": "You know, I had a big\nargument with Sara about time, and she's like, \"No, time doesn't exist.\" I'm like, \"No, no, time does exist.\" And as she realized that her\nconception of assembly theory and my conception of assembly\ntheory were the same thing, necessitated us to abandon\nthe fact that time is eternal. To actually really fundamentally question how the universe produces\ncombinatorial novelty. - So time is fundamental\nfor assembly theory? 'Cause I'm just trying to figure out where you and Sara converged. - I think assembly theory is\nfine in this time right now, but I think it helps us understand that something interesting is going on. And I'm been really inspired\nby a guy called Nick Gisin. I'm gonna butcher his argument, but I love his argument a lot. So I hope he forgives\nme if he hears about it. But basically, if you want free will, time has to be fundamental. And if you want time to be fundamental, you have to give up on\nplatonic mathematics and you have to use\nintuition as mathematics. And again, I'm gonna butcher this. But basically, Hilbert\nsaid that, you know, \"Infinite numbers are allowed.\" And I think it was Brouwer said, \"No, you can't, all numbers are finite.\" So let's go back a step, 'cause it was like people were gonna say, assembly theory seems to explain that large combinatorial space allows you to produce things\nlike life and technology. And that large combinatorial\nspace is so big it's not even accessible to a Sean Carroll or David Deutsch multiverse. The physicist saying that all of the universe already\nexists in time is probably, provably, that's a\nstrong word, not correct. That we are gonna know that\nthe universe as it stands, the present, the way the\npresent builds the future so big the universe can't\never contain the future. And this is a really interesting thing. I think Max Tegmark has\nthis mathematical universe where he says, \"You know, the universe is kind of like a block universe.\" And I apologize to Max\nif I'm getting it wrong. You have the initial conditions and you can run the\nuniverse right to the end and go backwards and\nforwards in that universe. That is not correct. - Yeah, let me load that in. The universe is not big\nenough to contain the future. - [Lee] Yeah, that's it. - So that's another\nbeautiful way of saying that time is fundamental. - Yes. This is why the law of\nthe excluded middle, something is true or false, only works in the past. Is it gonna snow in New York\nnext week, or in Austin? You might, in Austin, say, probably not. In New York, you might say, yeah. If you go forward to next week and say, did it snow in New York\nlast week, true or false? You can answer that question. The fact that the law\nof the excluded middle cannot apply to the future\nexplains why time is fundamental. - Well, I mean that's a good\nexample, intuitive example. But it is possible that we\nmight be able to predict, you know, whether it's gonna snow if we had the perfect information. You're saying it'd not. - Impossible. Impossible. So here's why. I'll make a really quick argument. And this argument isn't mine, it's Nick's and a few other people. - [Lex] Can you explain his\nview on time being fundamental? - Yeah, so I'll give my view, which kind of resonates with his. But basically, it's very simple actually. It would say that your ability to design and do an experiment is\nexercising free will. So he used that thought process. But I never really\nthought about it that way. And that you actively make decisions. I used to think that free will was a kind of consequence\nof just selection, but I'm kind of understanding\nthat human free will is something really interesting. And he very much inspired me. But a thing what Sara Walker said that inspired me as well. And these will converge. Is that I think that the universe- The universe is very big, huge. But actually, the place that is largest in the universe right now, the largest place in\nthe universe is earth. - Yeah. I've seen you say that, and boy, that's an interesting one to process. What do you mean by that? Earth is the biggest\nplace in the universe. - Because we have this\ncombinatorial scaffolding going all the way back from LUCA. So you've got cells\nthat can self-replicate. And then you go all the way\nto terraforming the earth. You've got all these architectures, the amount of selection that's going on, biological selection, just to be clear, biological evolution. And then you have multicellularity. Then animals, and abstraction. And with abstraction, there was another kick because you can then build architectures, and computers, and cultures, and language. And these things are the\nbiggest things that exist in the universe because we\ncan just build architectures that couldn't naturally arise anywhere. And the further that\ndistance goes in time, and this kind of is gigantic and- - [Lex] From a complexity perspective. - Yeah.\n- Okay, wait a minute. I mean, I know you're being poetic, but how do you know there's\nnot other earth-like- You're basically saying\nearth is really special. It's awesome stuff. As far as we look out, there's nothing like it going on. But how do you know there's\nnot a nearly infinite number of places where cool stuff\nlike this is going on? - I agree. I'll say again that earth\nis the most gigantic thing we know in the universe. Combinatorially, we know. - [Lex] We know. Okay, yeah. - Now, I guess, this\nis just purely a guess, I have no data, but other than hope. Well, maybe not hope. No, I have some data."

      "text": "That every star in the\nsky probably has planets and life is probably\nemerging on these planets. But the amount of contingency\nthat has associated with life is that I think the\ncombinatorial space associated with these planets is so different our causal cones are never\ngonna overlap, or not easily. And this is a thing that\nmakes me sad about alien life. That's why we have to create alien life in the lab as quickly as possible, because I don't know\nif we are gonna be able to build architectures that will intersect with alien intelligence architectures. - And intersect, you don't\nmean in time or space? - [Lee] Time and the\nability to communicate. - So the ability to communicate. - Yeah. My biggest fear, in a way,\nis that life is everywhere, but we've become infinitely more lonely because there are scaffolding\nin that combinatorial space, because it's so big. - So you're saying the constraints created by the environment that led to the factory of Darwinian evolution are\njust a little, tiny cone in a nearly infinite\ncombinatorial space, so there's other cones like it.\n- Exactly. - Why can't we communicate with other- Just because we can't create it doesn't mean we can't\nappreciate the creation, right? Sorry, detect the creation. - I truly don't know, but it's an excuse for\nme to ask for people to give me money to\nmake a planet simulator. - Yeah, right. With a different kind of- - I'm just like another\nshameless scientist, it's like gimme money, I need to play. - This was all a long plugged\nfor a planet simulator. Hey, I will be the\nfirst in line to donate. - My Rick garage has run\nout of room, you know? - [Lex] Yeah. - No- - And this is a planet simulator. You mean, like a different kind of planet or different set sets of\nenvironments and pressures. - Exactly. If we could basically recreate\nthe selection before biology, as we know it, that gives\nrise to a different biology, we should be able to put the constraints on where to look in the universe. So here's the thing, here's my dream. My dream is that by\ncreating life in the lab, based upon constraints we understand. So let's like go for Venus-type life or earth-type life or something again. Do Earth 2.0. Screw it, let's do Earth 2.0. An Earth 2.0 has a\ndifferent genetic alphabet. Fine. That's fine. Different protein alphabet. Fine. Have cells and the\nevolution all that stuff. We will then be able to say, okay, life is a more general phenomena. Selection is more general\nthan what we think is the chemical constraints on life. And we can point the James Webb and other telescopes at other planets. That we are in that zone, we are most likely to\ncombinatorially overlap with, right? So there are chemistry- - [Lex] You're looking for some overlap. - And then, we can then\nbasically shine light on them, literally, and might look\nat light coming back, and apply advanced assembly theory to general theory of\nlanguage, that we'll get, and say, ha, in that signal, it looks random but there's a copy number. Oh, this random set of things that looks like a true and random number generator has structure as not Kolmogorov, AIT-type structure, but\nevolutionary structure, given by assembly theory. But I would say that, 'cause I'm a shameless assembly theorist. - Yeah. It just feels like the cone, I might be misusing the word cone here, but the width of the cone\nis growing really fast to where eventually all the cones overlap, even in a very, very, very\nlarge combinatorial space. But, then again, if\nyou're saying the universe is also growing very quickly\nin terms of possibilities. - I hope that as we build abstractions- I mean, one idea is that\nas we go to intelligence, intelligence allows us to\nlook at the regularities around us in the universe, and that gives us some common grounding to discuss with aliens. And you might be right. That we will overlap there, even though we have completely\ndifferent chemistry, literally completely different chemistry, that we will be able pass\ninformation from one another. But it's not a given. And, you know, I have to kind of try and divorce hope\nand emotion, you know, away from what I can logically justify. - But it's just hard to\nintuit a world, a universe, where there's nearly\ninfinite complexity objects and they somehow can't detect each other. - But the universe is expanding. But the nice thing is I would say- You see, I think Carl Sagan did the wrong, well, not the wrong thing, he flicked the Voyager probe\ndown at a pale, blue dot, said, \"Look at how big the universe is.\" I would've done it the\nother way around and said, \"Look at the Voyager probe that\ncame from the planet earth, that came from LUCA, look at how big earth is.\" - [Lex] They produced that. - It produced that. And I think it's like, completely amazing. And then that should allow people on earth to think about, well,\nprobably we should try and get causal chains off earth onto Mars, onto the moon, wherever. Whether it's human life or\nMartian life that we create, it doesn't matter. But I think this\ncombinatorial space tells us something very important\nabout the universe. And that I realized in assembly theory, that the universe is too\nbig to contain itself. And now coming back, and I want to kind of\nchange your mind about time, 'cause I'm guessing that your\ntime is just a coordinate. - Yeah.\n- So I'm gonna change- - [Lex] I'm guessing you\nare one of those, yeah. - One of those. I'm gonna change your mind in real time, or at least attempt. - Oh, in real time. There you go. I already got the tattoo, so this is gonna be embarrassing\nif you change my mind. - [Lee] But you can just add an arrow of time onto it, right? - Yeah, true. Just modify it. - Or erase it a bit.\n- Yeah. - And the argument that I think that is really most interesting is like, people say the\ninitial conditions specify the future of the universe. Okay, fine, let's say that's\nthe case for a moment. Now let's go back to Newtonian mechanics. Now, the uncertainty principle in Newtonian mechanics is this. If I give you the coordinates of an object moving in space and the coordinates of another object, and they collide in space, and you know those initial conditions, you should know exactly\nwhat's gonna happen. However, you cannot\nspecify these coordinates to infinite precision. Now, everyone said, \"Oh,\nthis is kind of like, you know, the chaos theory argument.\" No, no, it's deeper than that. Here's the problem with numbers. This is where Hilbert\nand Brouwer fell out. To have the coordinates of this object, an given object as it's colliding, you have to have them\nto infinite precision. That's what Hilbert says. He says, \"No problem,\ninfinite precision is fine.\" Let's just take that for granted. But when the object is finite and it can't store its own coordinates, what do you do? - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - So in principle, if a finite\nobject cannot be specified to infinite precision, in principle, the initial conditions don't apply. - Well, how do you it can't store its- - Well, how would you store\nan infinitely long number in a finite size? - Well, we're using\ninfinity very loosely here. - [Lee] No, no, we're using- - Infinite precision. I mean, not loosely, but- - Very precisely.\n- So you think infinite precision is required? - Well, let's take the object. Let's say the object is a golf ball. A golf ball is a few\ncentimeters in diameter, we can work out how many\natoms are on the golf ball. And let's say we can store numbers down to atomic dislocations. So we can work out how many atoms there are in the golf ball, and we can store the coordinates in that golf ball down to that number. But beyond that, we can't. Let's make the golf ball smaller. And this is where I think\nthat we get randomness in quantum mechanics. And some people say you\ncan't get randomness in quantum mechanics, is deterministic. But, aha, this is where we realize that classical mechanics\nand quantum mechanics suffer from the same uncertainty principle. And that is the inability to specify in the initial conditions\nto a precise enough degree to give you determinism. The universe is intrinsically too big. And that's why time exists. It's nondeterministic. Looking back into the past, you can use logical arguments, because you can say, was it true or false? You wouldn't know. But the fact we are unable\nto predict the future with the precision is not\nevidence of lack of knowledge, it's evidence the universe\nis generating new things. - Okay, first of all, quantum mechanics, you can just say statistically\nwhat's gonna happen when two golf balls hit each other. - Statistically. Sure, I can say statistically\nwhat's gonna happen. But then when they do happen, and you keep nesting it together. I mean, it goes almost back to- Let's think about entropy in the universe. How do we understand\nentropy change or a process? We can use the ergodic hypothesis. We can also have the counterfactuals, where we have all the different states. And we can even put that\nin the multiverse, right? But both those, they're nonphysical. The multiverse kind of collapses back to the same problem, about the precision. If you accept you don't have to have true and false going\nforward into the future, the real numbers are real. They're observables. - I'm trying to see exactly where time being fundamental sneaks in. The golf ball can't contain its own position perfectly precisely, how that leads to time\nneeding to be fundamental. - Do you believe or do you\naccept you have free will? - Yeah, I think at this moment in time, I believe that I have free will. - So then you have to believe\nthat time is fundamental. - I understand that's the\nstatement you've made. - Well, no, that we can logically follow. It's because if you don't have free will. So like, if you're in a\nuniverse that has no time, the universe is deterministic. If it's deterministic,\nthen you have no free will. - I think the space of\nhow much we don't know is so vast that saying the\nuniverse is deterministic and from that jumping\nto there's no free will, it's just too difficult of a leap. - No, it logically follows. No, no, I totally disagree. I mean, it's deep and it's important, all I'm saying, and it's actually different\nto what I've said before, is that if you don't require\nPlatonistic mathematics and accept that nondeterminism\nis how the universe looks, and that gives us our creativity in the way the universe\nis getting novelty, it's kind of really deeply\nimportant in assembly theory. 'Cause assembly theory starts to actually give you\na mechanism why you go from boring time, which is basically initial\nconditions specify everything, to a mismatch in creative time. And I hope we'll do experiments. And I think it's really important to- I would love to do an experiment that proves that time is fundamental and the universe is generating novelty. I don't know all the features\nof that experiment yet, but by, you know, having\nthese conversations openly and getting people to think\nabout the problems in a new way, better people, more intelligent people with good mathematical\nbackgrounds can say, oh, hey, I've got an idea. I would love to do an experiment that shows that the universe- I mean, universe is too big for itself going forward in time. And, you know, this is why I really hate the idea of the Boltzmann brain. The Boltzmann brain makes\nme super, kind of like, you know, everyone's having a free lunch. It's like, well, let's break\nall the laws of physics. So a Boltzmann brain is this idea that in a long enough universe the brain will just emerge\nin the universe as conscious. And that neglects the causal chain of evolution required\nto produce that brain. And this is where the\ncomputational argument really falls down, because the computationalist can say, I can calculate probability\nof a Boltzmann brain, and they'll give you a probability. But I can calculate probability\nof a Boltzmann brain. Zero. - Just because the space\nof possibility is so large? - Yeah, it's like when we\nstart fooling ourselves with numbers that we\ncan't actually measure and we can't ever conceive of, I think it doesn't give\nus a good explanation. I want to explain why\nlife is in the universe. I think life is actually\nthe novelty miner. I mean, life basically mines novelty almost from the future and\nactualizes in the present. - Okay. Life is a novelty miner from the future that is actualized in the present. - Yep. I think so.\n- Novelty miner. First of all, novelty. What's the origin of novelty? When you go from boring time to creative time, where's that? Is it as simple as randomness, like you're referring to? - I'm really struggling with randomness because I had a really good argument with Joscha Bach about randomness. And he says that randomness\ndoesn't give you free will. That's insane, 'cause\nyou'd just be random. And I think he's right at that level, but I don't think he is\nright on another level. And it's not about randomness, it's about constrained. I'm gonna sound like- I'm making this up as I go along. So making this up. Constrained opportunity. So the novelty. What is novelty? You know, this is why I\nthink it's a funny thing. Well, if you ever wanna discuss AI. Why I think everyone's kind of gone AI mad is that they're misunderstanding novelty. But let's think about novelty. Yes, what is novelty? So I think novelty is a\ngenuinely new configuration that is not predicted by the past, right? And that you discover\nin the present, right? And that is truly different, right? Some people say that\nnovelty doesn't exist, it's always with precedent. I want to do experiments that show that that is not the case. And it goes back to a question you asked me a few moments ago, which is where is the factory? - Yeah.\n- Right? Because I think the same mechanism that gives us a factory gives us novelty. And I think that is why I'm\nso deeply hung up on time. I mean, of course, I'm wrong, but how wrong? And I think that life opens\nup that combinatorial space in a way that our current laws of physics, as contrived in a deterministic\ninitial condition universe, even with the get-out-of-the-multiverse\nDavid Deutsch-style, which I love, by the way, but I don't think is correct. But it's really beautiful. - [Lex] The multiverse? - The David Deutsch's\nconception of the multiverse is kind of like given. But I think that the problem\nwith wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics is\nnot about the multiverse, it's about understanding\nhow determined the past is. Well, I don't just think that. Actually, this is a\ndiscussion I was having with Sara about that, right? Where she was like, \"Oh, I think-\" We've been debating this\nfor a long time now, about how do we reconcile novelty, determinism, indeterminism? - So, okay, just to clarify. You both, you and Sara think the universe is not deterministic? - I won't speak for Sara, but I roughly can. I think the universe is\ndeterministic looking back in the past, but undetermined\ngoing forward in the future. So I'm kinda having my\ncake and eating it here. This is because I fundamentally don't understand randomness, right? As Joscha told me or other people told me. But if I adopt a new view now. The new view is the universe\nis just nondeterministic. But I'd like to refine that and say the universe appears deterministic\ngoing back in the past, but it's undetermined going\nforward in the future. So how can we have a universe that has deterministically looking rules that's non determined\ngoing into the future? It's breakdown in precision\nin the initial conditions. And we have to just stop\nusing initial conditions and start looking at trajectories and how the combinatorial space behaves in the expanding universe\nin time and space. And assembly theory helps us quantify the transition to biology, and biology appears to be novelty mining, 'cause it's making crazy stuff. You know, that we are\nunique to earth, right? That there are objects\non earth that are unique to earth that will not\nbe found anywhere else, 'cause you can do the combinatorial math. - What was that statement\nyou made about life is novelty mining from the future? - [Lee] Yeah. - What's the little element of\ntime that you're introducing? - So what I'm kinda meaning is 'cause the future is\nbigger than the present, in a deterministic universe, how do the states go from one to another? I mean, there's a mismatch, right? - [Lex] Mm-hmm. Yeah. - So that must mean that\nyou have a little bit of indeterminism,\nwhether that's randomness or something else, I don't understand. I want to do experiments\nto formulate a theory to refine that as we go forward that might help us explain that. And I think that's why I am so determined to try and crack the\nnonlife to life transition looking at networks and molecules and that might help us\nthink about the mechanism. But certainly, the future\nis bigger than the past, in my conception of the universe and some conception of the universe. - By the way, that's not obvious, right? The future being bigger than the past. Well, that's one statement. And the statement that the\nuniverse is not big enough to contain the future\nis another statement. - [Lee] Yeah. - That one is a big one. That one's a really big one. - I think so. But I think it's entirely- Because look, we have the second law. And right now, I mean, we\ndon't need the second law if the future's bigger than the past. It follows naturally.\n- Right. - So why are we retrofitting\nall these sticking plasters onto our reality to hold\nonto a timeless universe? - Yeah, but that's because\nit's kind of difficult to imagine the universe that\ncan't contain the future. - [Lee] But isn't that really exciting? - It's very exciting,\nbut it's (laughs) hard. I mean, we're humans on earth, and we have a very kinda\nfour-dimensional conception of the world, of 3D plus time. It's just hard to intuit a world where- What does it even mean? A universe that can't contain the future? - Yeah, it's kinda crazy but obvious. - It's weird. I mean, I suppose it sounds\nobvious, yeah, if it's true. - So the reason why\nassembly theory turned me onto that was that- Let's just start in the present and look at all the complex molecules and go backwards in time and understand how evolutionary processes gave rise to them. It's not at all obvious. The Taxol, which is one of the most complex natural\nproducts produced by biology, was gonna be invented by biology. It's an accident. You know, Taxol is unique to earth. There's no Taxol\nelsewhere in the universe. And Taxol was not decided\nby the initial conditions. It was decided by this\ninterplay between the- So the past simply is\nembedded in the present, it gives some features. But why the past doesn't map\nto the future, one-to-one, is because the universe is\ntoo big to contain itself. That gives space for creativity, novelty, and some things\nwhich are unpredictable."

      "text": "- Okay, so given that you're disrespecting the power of the initial conditions, let me ask you about- So how do you explain\nthat cellular automata are able to produce such\nincredible complexity given just basic rules and\nbasic initial conditions? - I think that this falls\ninto the Brouwer-Hilbert trap. So how do you get a cellular automata to produce complexity? You have a computer,\nyou generate a display, and you map the change of that in time. There are some CAs repeat, like functions. It's fascinating to me that for pi, there is a formula where you can go to the millionth decimal place of pi and read out the number\nwithout having to go there. But there are some numbers\nwhere you can't do that. You have to just crank through. Whether it's Wolframian\ncomputational irreducibility or some other thing. Well, it doesn't matter. But these CAs, that complexity, is that just complexity, or a number that is\nbasically you're mining that number in time? You know, is that just a display screen for that number, that function? - Well, can't you say the same thing about the complexity on earth, then? - No, because the complexity on earth has a copy number and an assembly\nindex associated with it. That CA is just a number running. - You don't think it has a copy number? Wait, wait a minute. - Well, it does where we're looking at humans producing different rules, but then it's nested on selection. So those CAs are produced by selection. I mean, the CA is such a fascinating pseudo-complexity generator. What I would love to do is quantify the degree of surprise in a\nCA and run it long enough. But what I guess that means is we have to instantiate, we have to have a number\nof this experiments where we're generating different rules and running them time-steps. Ah, I got it. CAs are mining novelty, you know, in the future by iteration, right? And you're like, oh,\nthat's great, that's great. You didn't predict it. Some rules you can predict\nwhat's gonna happen, other rules you can't. So for me, if anything, CAs are evidence that the universe is too\nbig to contain itself. 'Cause otherwise, you'd\nknow what the rules are gonna do forever more. - Right. I guess you were saying\nthat the physicist saying that all you need is\nthe initial conditions and the rules of physics is somehow missing the bigger picture. - Yeah.\n- And, you know, if you look at CAs, all you need is the initial condition and the rules. and then run the thing. - You need three things. You need the initial conditions, you need the rules, and you need time\niteration to mine it out. Without the coordinate,\nyou can't get it out. - Sure. And that is fundamental. - And you can't predict it\nfrom the initial conditions. If you could, then it'd be fine. - [Lex] And that time is- - A resource.\n- Like the foundation of the history, the memory of each of the things it created. It has to have that memory of all the things that led up to it. - Yeah, you have to have the resource. - [Lex] Yeah. - 'Cause time is a fundamental resource. Yeah, I think I had a major\nepiphany about randomness. But I keep doing that every two days, and then it goes away again. It's random. - You're a time fundamentalist. - You should be as well. If you believe in free will, the only conclusion is\ntime is fundamental. Otherwise, you cannot have free will. It logically follows. - Well, the foundation\nof my belief in free will is just observation-driven. I think if you use logic, it's like logically it seems like the universe is deterministic. - Looking backward in time. And that's correct, the universe is. - And then everything\nelse is a kinda a leap. It requires a leap. - This is why I think machine learning is gonna provide a chunk of that, right? To help us explain this. So the way I'd say, if you take- - That's interesting. Why? - 'Cause the AI doomers\nare driving me mad."

      "text": "And we don't have any\nintelligence yet I call AI, autonomous informatics\njust to make people grumpy. - Yeah. You're saying we're\nquite far away from AGI. - I think that we have no\nconception of intelligence and I think that we don't understand how the human brain does what it does. I think that neuroscience\nis making great advances, but I think that we\nhave no idea about AGI. So I am a technological,\nI guess, optimist. I believe we should do everything. The whole regulation of AI is nonsensical. I mean, why would you regulate Excel other than the fact that\nClippy should come back? And I love Excel '97 'cause we can play, you know, we can do the flight simulator. - I'm sorry. In Excel? - Yeah, have you not played\nthe flight simulator in- - In Excel '97?\n- Yeah. - What does that look like? - It's like a wireframe. Very, very basic. But basically, I think it's\nX, zero, Y, zero, Shift, and it opens up and you can\nplay the fight simulator. - [Lex] Oh, wow. Wait, wait. Is he using Excel? - [Lee] Excel. Excel '97. - [Lex] Okay. - I resurrected it the other\nday and saw Clippy again for the first time in a long time. - Well, Clippy is definitely coming back. But you're saying we don't\nhave a great understanding of what is intelligence? What is the intelligence\nunderpinning the human mind? - I'm very frustrated by the way that we're AI dooming right now. And people were bestowing\nsome kind of magic. Now, let's go back a bit. So you said about AGI. Are we far away from AGI? Yes. I do not think we are gonna\nget to AGI anytime soon. I've seen no evidence of it. And the AI doom scenario is\nnonsensical in the extreme. - [Lex] Yeah. - And the reason why I\nthink it's nonsensical. And I don't think there\nisn't things we should do and be very worried about, right? I mean, there are things we\nneed to worry about right now, what AI are doing. Whether it's fake data, fake users, right? I want authentic people or authentic data. I don't want everything to be faked, and I think it's a really big problem. And I absolutely want to go on the record to say I really worry about that. What I'm not worried about is\nthat some fictitious entity is going to turn us all to paperclips or detonate nuclear bombs. I don't know. Maybe. I don't know. Anything you can't think of. Why is this? And I'll take a very simple\nseries of logical arguments. The AI doomers, they do not\nhave the correct episdemiology. They do not understand what knowledge is. And until we understand what knowledge is, they're not gonna get anywhere because they're applying things falsely. So let me give you a very simple argument. People talk about the\nprobability, P-doom, of AI. We can work out the probability of a asteroid hitting the planet. Why? 'Cause it's happened before. We know the mechanism. We know that there's a gravity well, or that, you know, space-time is bent and stuff falls in. We don't know the probability of AGI because we have no mechanism. So let me give you another one. Which is like, I'm\nreally worried about AG. What's AG? AG is antigravity. One day we could wake up\nand antigravity, you know, is discovered, we're all gonna die. The atmosphere's gonna float away. We are gonna float away. We're all doomed. What is the probability of AG? We don't know because\nthere's no mechanism for AG. Do we worry about it? No. And I don't understand the current reason for certain people in certain areas to be generating this nonsense. I think they're not doing it maliciously. I think we're observing the\nemergence of new religions, how religions come. Because religions are\nabout kind of some control. So you've got the optimist\nsaying AI's gonna cure us all and AI's gonna kill us all. What's the reality? Well, we don't have AI, we have really powerful\nmachine learning tools and they will allow us\nto do interesting things. And we need to be careful\nabout how we use those tools in terms of manipulating human beings and faking stuff, right?\n- Right. Well, let me try to sort of (indistinct) in the AI doomers argument. And actually I don't know. Are AI doomers in the\nYudkowsky camp saying it's definitely gonna kill us? 'Cause there's a spectrum. - [Lee] 95% I think is that limit, yeah. - And 95% plus, that's the- - No, no, not plus. I dunno, I was seeing on\nTwitter today various things. But I think Yudkowsky's is at 95%. - But to belong to the AI doomer club, is there a threshold? I don't know what the membership- - Maybe.\n- And what are the fees? - Well, I think Scott Aaronson, like, I was quite surprised. I saw this online, so it could be wrong, so sorry if it's wrong, says 2%. But the thing is, if someone said there's a 2% chance you're\ngonna die going into the lift, would you go into the lift? - In the elevator\n- Yeah, elevator. - For the American\nEnglish speaking audience. Well, no, not for the elevator. - So I would say anyone higher than 2%. I mean, I think there's\na 0% chance of AGI doom. Zero. - Just to push back on the on the argument where at the end of zero on the AGI. We can see on earth that\nthere's increasing levels of intelligence of organisms. We can see what humans\nwith extra intelligence were able to do to the other species. So that is a lot of samples of data what a delta in intelligence gives you. When you have an increase in intelligence, how you're able to dominate\na species on earth. And so the idea there is that if you have a being that's 10x smarter than humans, we are not gonna be able to predict what that being is going to be able to do, especially if it has the\npower to hurt humans. You can imagine a lot of trajectories in which the more benefit AI systems give the more control we\ngive to those AI systems over our power grid,\nover our nuclear weapons or weapons of any sort. And then it's hard to know what a ultra intelligence system would be able to do in that case. You don't find that convincing? - I think I would fail that argument 100%. Here's a number of reasons to fail it on. First of all, we dunno where\nthe intention comes from. The problem is that people think. You know, because I've been watching all the hucksters online\nwith the prompt engineering and all this stuff. When I talk to a typical\nAI computer scientist, they keep talking about the AI as having some kind of\ndecision-making ability. That is a category error. The decision-making ability\ncomes from human beings. We have no understanding of\nhow humans make decision. We've just been discussing free will for the last half an hour, right? We don't even know what that is. So the intention. I totally agree with you, people who intend to do bad\nthings can do bad things and we should not let that risk go. That's totally here and now. I do not want that to happen, and I'm happy to be regulated to make sure that systems I generate, whether they're like computer systems or- You know, I'm working on a new\nproject called ChemMachina. - (chuckles) Nice. Well done.\n- Yeah, yeah. Which is basically a- - (laughing) For people who\ndon't understand the point, the \"Ex Machina\" is a great film about, I guess, AGI embodied. And chem is the chemistry version of that. - And I only know one way\nto embody intelligence, that's in chemistry in human brains. So, category area number\none is they have agency. Category area number two\nis saying that assuming that anything we make is\ngonna be more intelligent. Now you didn't say superintelligent, I'll put the words into our mouths here. Here's superintelligent. I think that there is no reason to expect that we are gonna make systems that are more intelligent, more capable. You know, when people play chess computers they don't expect to win now, right? The chess computer is very good at chess, that doesn't mean it's superintelligent. So I think that superintelligence- Well, I mean, I think even Nick Bostrom is pulling back on this now. So I see this a lot. When did I see it first happen? Eric Drexler, nanotechnology,\natomically precise machines. He came up with a world where we had these atom cogs everywhere, we're gonna make\nself-replicating nanobots. Not possible. Why? Because there's no resources to build these self-replicating nanobots. You can't get the precision. It doesn't work. It was a major category error in taking engineering principles down to the molecular level. The only functioning\nmolecular technology we know- No, sorry. The only functioning\nnano molecular technology we know produced by evolution. There. So now let's go forward to AGI. What is AGI? We dunno. It's super, it can do this, or humans can't think. I would argue the only AGIs\nthat exist in the universe are produced by evolution. And sure, we may be able to\nmake our working memory better, we might be able to do more things. The human brain is the\nmost compact computing unit in the universe. It uses 20 watts. It a uses a really limited volume. It's not like a ChatGPT cluster which has to have thousands of watts, a model that's generated, and it has to be\ncorrected by human beings. You are autonomous and\nembodied intelligence. So I think that there are so many levels that we're missing out. We've just kinda went,\noh, we've discovered fire, oh gosh, the planet's just\ngonna burn one day, randomly. I mean, I just don't understand that leap. There are bigger problems\nwe need to worry about. So what is the motivation? Why are these people, let's assume they have their earnest, have this conviction? Well, I think it's kind\nof they're making leaps, they're trapped in a virtual\nreality that isn't reality. - Well, I mean I can continue\na set of arguments here. But also, it is true that ideologies that fearmonger are dangerous. Because you can then use it to control, to regulate in a way that halts progress, to control people, and to cancel people, all that kinda stuff. So you have to be careful, because the reason ultimately wins, right? But there is a lotta concerns\nwith superintelligent systems, very capable systems. I think when you hear the\nword superintelligent, you're hearing like,\nit's smarter than humans in every way that humans are smart. But the paperclip manufacturing system doesn't need to be smart in every way, it just needs to be\nsmart in specific ways. And the more capable\nthe AI systems become, the more you could see us\ngiving them control over, like I said, our power grid, a lot of aspects of human life. And then that means they'll be able to do more and more damage when there's unintended\nconsequences that come to life. - I think that that's right, the unintended consequences\nwe have to think about. And that I fully agree with. But let's go back a bit. Sentient. I mean, again, I'm far\naway from my comfort zone in all this stuff, but,\nhey, let's talk about it 'cause I'll give myself a qualification. - Yeah, we're both qualified\nand sentience, I think, as much as anyone else. - I think the paperclip scenario\nis just such a poor one. Because let's think about\nhow that would happen. And also, let's think about we are being so unrealistic about how\nmuch of the earth's surface we have commandeered. You know, for paperclip\nmanufacturing to really happen, I mean, do the math. It's not gonna happen. There's not enough energy. There's not enough resource. Where is it all gonna come from? I think that what happens\nin evolution is really. Why has a killer virus not\nkilled all life on earth? Well, what happens is, sure, super killer viruses that kill the ribosome have emerged. But you know what happens? They nuke a small space\nbecause they can't propagate, they all die. So there's this interplay\nbetween evolution and propagation, right? And death. And so- - In evolution? You don't think it's possible\nto engineer, for example, sorry to interrupt, but\nlike a perfect virus- - No\n- That's deadly enough. - No, it's nonsensical. - Okay.\n- I think that just, again, it wouldn't work,\n'cause if it was too deadly, it would just kill the\nradius and not replicate it. - Yeah. I mean, but you don't think\nit's possible to get a- (Lee stammering) Not kill all of life on\nearth, but kill all humans? There's not many of us. There's only like, 8 billion. There's so much more ants. - I mean, I don't-\n- So many more ants. And they're pretty smart. - The nice thing about where we are. I would love for the AI crowd to take a leaf out of the book of the biowarfare, chemical warfare crowd. I mean, not love, 'cause actually people have been killed with chemical weapons in the\nFirst and Second World War, and bio weapons have been made, and, you know, we can argue about COVID-19 and all this stuff. Let's not go there just now. But I think there is a consensus that certain things are bad and we shouldn't do them, right? And sure, it would be\npossible for a bad actor to engineer something bad, but we would see it coming and we would be able to\ndo something about it. Now, I guess what I'm trying to say is when people talk about doom and when you ask them for the mechanism, they just say, you know,\nthey just make something up. I mean, in this case, I'm Yann LeCun. I think he put out a very good point about trying to regulate jet engines before we've even invented them. And I think that's what I'm saying. I just don't understand why these guys are going round literally making stuff up about us all dying, when basically we need to\nactually really focus on. Now, let's say that\nsome actors are earnest. Right, let's say Yudkowsky\nis being earnest, right? And he really cares. But he loves it, he goes, he-he-he, and then you are all gonna die. It's like, you know, why don't\nwe try and do the same thing and say, you could do this, and then you're all gonna\nbe happy forever after. - Yeah.\n- You know? - Well, I think there's\nseveral things to say there. One, I think there is a role in society for people that say we're all gonna die, 'cause I think it filters\nthrough as a message, as a viral message that gives us the proper amount of concern. - Okay. All right. - It's not 95%. But when you say 95%, and it filters through society, it'll give an average of\nlike .03%, an average. So it's nice to have people that are like, \"we're all gonna die,\" then we'll have a proper concern. Like for example, I do believe\nwe're not properly concerned about the threat of\nnuclear weapons currently. It just seems like people have forgotten that that's a thing. And, you know, there's a war in Ukraine with a nuclear power involved. There's nuclear powers\nthroughout the world. And it just feels like were on the brink of a potential world war to a percentage that I don't think people\nare properly calibrating, like, in their head. We're all thinking it's a Twitter battle, as opposed to like actual threat. So like, it's nice to have\nthat kind of level of concern. But to me, like, when I hear AI doomers, what I'm imagining is, with\nunintended consequences, a potential situation where, let's say, 5% of the world suffers deeply because of a mistake made\nof unintended consequences. I don't wanna imagine the entirety of human civilization dying, but there could be a lot of suffering if this is done poorly. - I understand that, and I kind of, I guess, I mean, I'm involved\nin the whole hype cycle. So what's happening right now is there seems to be- So let's say having some people\nsaying AI doom is a worry. Fine, let's give them that. But what seems to be happening is there seems to be people\nwho don't think AI is doom and they're trying to use\nthat to control regulation and to push people to regulate, which stops humans generating knowledge. And I am an advocate for generating as much knowledge as possible."

      "text": "When it comes to nuclear weapons, I grew up in the '70s and '80s where lot of adults really\nhad existential threat. Almost as bad as now with AI doom, they were really worried, right? There were some great, well, not great, there were some horrific documentaries. I think there's one called \"Threads\" that was generated in the UK, which was like, it was terrible. It was like so scary. And I think that the correct thing to do is obviously get rid of nuclear weapons. But let's think about\nunintended consequences. We've got rid of- (Lee muttering) We got rid of all the sulfur particles in the atmosphere, right? All the soot. And what's happened in\nthe last couple of years is global warming has accelerated 'cause we've cleaned up\nthe atmosphere too much. So-\n- Sure. I mean, the same thing if you\nget rid of nuclear weapons, you get-\n- Exactly, that's my point. So what we could do is if we actually started\nto put the AI in charge, which I really like, an AI to be in charge of all world politics. And this just sounds ridiculous\nfor a second, hang on. But if we could all agree on- - [Lex] The AI doomers just woke up. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n- On that statement. - But I really don't like politicians who are basically just\nlooking at local sampling. But if you could say globally, look, here's some game theory here. What is the minimum\nnumber of nuclear weapons we need to distribute around the world to everybody to basically\nreduce war to zero? - I mean, just the start\nexperiment of the United States, and China, and Russia, and major\nnuclear powers get together and say, all right, we're gonna\ndistribute nuclear weapons to every single nation on earth. - [Lee] Yeah. (chuckles) Oh boy. I mean, that has a probably\ngreater than 50% chance of eliminating major military conflict. - Yeah.\n- Yeah, but it's not 100%. - But I don't think anyone will use them. And look, what you've\ngotta try and do is, like, for to qualify for these nuclear weapons- This is a great idea. The game theorists\ncould to do this, right? The question is this. I really buy your question, we have too many nukes. Just from a feeling point of view that we've got too many of them. So let's reduce the number,\nbut not get rid of them, because we'll have too\nmuch conventional warfare. So then, what is the minimum\nnumber of nuclear weapons we can just shoot around to remove- Humans hurting each other is\nsomething we should stop doing? It's not out with our\nconceptual capability. But right now, what about certain nations that are being exploited\nfor their natural resources in the future for a short-term gain because we don't wanna generate knowledge? And so, if everybody had\nan equal doomsday switch, I predict the quality of\nlife for a average human will go up faster. I am an optimist, and\nI believe that humanity is gonna get better and better and better, that we're gonna eliminate more problems. But I think, yeah, let's- - But the probability of a bad actor, of one of the nations\nsetting off a nuclear weapon. I mean, you have to integrate\nthat into the atmosphere. - But we just give you the\nnukes like population, right? What we do is we- (laughing) I can't believe this. But anyway, let's just go there. So if a small nation with\na couple of nukes uses one because they're a bit bored or annoyed, the likelihood that they\nare gonna be pummeled out of existence immediately is 100%. And yet, they've only\nnuked one other city. I know this is crazy, and I apologize for- - Well, no, no. Just to be clear, we're just having a thought experiment. That's interesting, but, you know, there's terrorist organizations that would take that trade. We have to ask ourselves a question of which percentage of humans would be suicide bombers, essentially? Where they would sacrifice their own life because they hate another group of people. I believe it's a very small fraction, but is it large enough if\nyou give out nuclear weapons? - I can predict a future where\nwe take all nuclear material and we burn it for energy, right? 'Cause we're getting there. And the other thing you could do is say, look, there's a gap. So if we get all the countries to sign up to the virtual nuclear\nagreement where we all exist, we have a simulation, where we can each other in the simulation and the economic consequences\nare catastrophic. - Sure. In the simulation. I love it. It's not gonna kill all humans, it's just going to have\neconomic consequences. - [Lee] Yeah. I don't know, I just made it up. It seems like a cool idea.\n- No, it's interesting. I mean, but it's interesting whether that would have as much\npower on human psychology as actual physical nuclear exposure. - I think so.\n- It's possible. But people don't take economic\nconsequences as seriously, I think, as actual nuclear weapons. - I think they do in Argentina,\nand they do in Somalia, and they do in a lot\nof these places where- No, I think this is a great idea. I'm a strong advocate now for- So what've we come up with? Burning all the nuclear\nmaterial to have energy. And before we do that, 'cause mad is good, mutually assured destruction\nis very powerful, let's take it into the metaverse, and then get people to\nkind of subscribe to that. And if they actually nuke each other, even for fun in the metaverse, there are dire consequences. - Yeah. Yeah. So it's like a video game. We all have to join this\nmetaverse video game, and then there's dire\neconomic consequences. And it's all run by AI, as you mentioned, so the AI doomers are really\nterrified at this point. - No, they're happy, they have a job for another 20 years, right? - Oh, okay, fearmongering. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a believer in equal employment."

      "section": "Chem Machina",
      "text": "- You've mentioned that,\nwhat did you call it? ChemMachina?\n- Yeah. - Yeah. So you've mentioned that a chemical brain is something you're interested in creating and that's a way to get conscious AI soon. Can you explain what a chemical brain is? - I wanna understand the\nmechanism of intelligence as gone through evolution, right? 'Cause the way that intelligence\nwas produced by evolution appears to be the following. Origin of life. Multicellularity. Locomotion. Senses. Once you can start to see\nthings coming towards you and you can remember the past and interrogate the present and imagine the future, you can do something amazing, right? And I think only in recent years did humans become Turing complete, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - And so, that Turing completeness kinda gave us another kick up. But our ability to\nprocess that information is produced in a wet brain. And I think that we do not have the correct hardware architectures to have the domain flexibility and the ability to integrate information. I think intelligence also comes at a massive compromise of data. Right now, we're obsessing about\ngetting more and more data, more and more processing, more and more tricks to get dopamine hits. So when we look back on this, going, oh yeah, that was really cool, 'cause when I asked ChatGPT, it made me feel really happy. I got a hit from it, but actually it just exposed\nhow little intelligence I use in every moment,\nbecause I'm easily fooled. So what I would like to do is to say, well, hey, hang on, what\nis it about the brain? So the brain has this\nincredible connectivity and it has the ability to, you know, as I said earlier about\nmy nephew, you know, I went from Bill to Billy and\nhe went, \"oh right, Leroy.\" Like, how did he make that leap? That he was able to basically,\nwithout any training. I extended his name, that he doesn't like. He wants to be called Bill. He went back and said, \"You\nliked to be called Lee, I'm gonna call you Leroy.\" So human beings have a brilliant ability- Or, intelligent beings appear\nto have a brilliant ability to integrate across all\ndomains all at once, and to synthesize something which allows us to generate knowledge. And become Turing complete on our own, although AI's a built-in\nTuring complete things, their thinking is not Turing complete in that they are not able to\nbuild universal explanations. And that lack of universal explanation means that they're just inductivist. Inductivism doesn't get you anywhere. It's just basically a party trick. I think it's in the \"Fabric of\nReality\" from David Deutsch, where basically, you know, the farmer is feeding\nthe chicken every day and the chicken's getting fat and happy. And the chicken's like, \"I'm really happy every time the farmer\ncomes in and feeds me.\" And then, one day, the farmer comes in and instead of feeding the chicken, just wrings its neck, you know? And had the chicken had an\nalternative understanding of why the farmer was feeding it. - It's interesting though, because we don't know what's special about the human mind\nthat's able to come up with these kinda generalities, this universal theories of things. And to come up with novelty. I can imagine, 'cause you\ngave an example, you know, about William and Leroy. I feel like a example\nlike that we'll be able to see in future versions\nof large language models. We'll be really, really,\nreally impressed by the humor, the insights, all of it. Because it's fundamentally trained on all the incredible humor and insights that's available out there\non the internet, right? I think we'll be impressed. - [Lee] Oh, I'm impressed. - Right, increasingly so. - But we're mining the past.\n- Yes. - And what the human brain\nappears to be able to do is mine the future.\n- Yes. It's a novelty. It is interesting whether\nthese large language models will ever be able to come up with something truly novel. - I can show on the\nback of a piece of paper why that's impossible. And it's like, the problem is that, and again, these are domain experts kind of bullshitting each other. The term generative.\n- Yes. - Right? Average person thinks,\noh, it's generative. No, no, no. If I take the numbers\nbetween zero and 1000 and I train a model to\npick out the prime numbers by giving all the prime\nnumbers between zero and 1000. It doesn't know what a prime number is. Occasionally, if I can cheat a bit, it will start to guess. It never will produce\nanything out with the dataset because you mine the past. The thing that I'm getting to is I think that actually current\nmachine learning technologies might actually help reveal\nwhy time is fundamental. It's like kind of insane. Because they tell you about\nwhat's happened in the past, but they can never help you\nunderstand what's happening in the future without training examples. Sure, if that thing\nhappens again, it's like- So let's think about what large\nlanguage models are doing. We have all the internet as we\nknow it, you know, language. But also, they're doing something else. We're having human beings\ncorrecting it all the time. Those models are being corrected. - Steered. - Corrected. Modified. Tweaked. - [Lex] Well yeah, but I mean- - Cheating. - (chuckles) Well, you\ncould say the training on human data in the first\nplace is cheating but- - The human is in the\nloop. Sorry to interrupt. - Yeah, so human is\ndefinitely in the loop. But it's not just human is in the loop, a very large collection\nof humans is in the loop. And that could be- I mean, to me, it's not intuitive that you said prime numbers, that the system can't\ngenerate an algorithm, right? That the algorithm that\ncan generate prime numbers, or the algorithm that can tell you if a number prime and so on, and generate algorithms\nthat generate algorithms that generate algorithms that start to look a lot like human\nreasoning, you know? - I think, again, we can show\nthat on a piece of paper. That, sure. So this is the failure in episdemiology. Like, I'm glad I even can say that word, let alone know what it means, right? - You said it multiple times. - I know, it's like three times now. - Without failure Quit while you're ahead. Just don't say it again,\n'cause you did really well. - Yeah, thanks. So what is reasoning? So coming back to the chemical brain, if I could show that in a- 'Cause, I mean, I'm never gonna make an intelligence in ChemMachina, because if we don't have brain cells they don't have glial cells, they don't have neurons. But if I can take a gel\nand engineer the gel to have it be a hybrid\nhardware for reprogramming, which I think I know how to do, I'll process a lot more information and train models billions of times cheaper and use cross-domain knowledge. And there's certain\ntechniques I think we can do. But it's still missing the abilities of human beings that had\nto become Turing complete. And so, I guess the\nquestion to give back at you is like, how do you tell the difference between trial and error and the\ngeneration of new knowledge? I think the way you can do it is this. Is that you come up with\na theory, an explanation, just inspiration comes from out, yeah. You test that, and then you see that's\ngoing towards the truth. And human beings are\nvery good at doing that in the transition between philosophy, mathematics, physics,\nand natural sciences. And I think that we can see that. Where I get confused is\nwhy people misappropriate the term artificial intelligence to say, hey, there's\nsomething else going on here. Because I think you and I both agree, machine learning's really good. It's only gonna get better, we're gonna get happier with the outcome. But why would you ever think the model is thinking, or reasoning? Reasoning requires intention. And the intention, if the\nmodel isn't reasoning, the intentions come from the prompter, and the intentions come from the person who programmed it to do it. - But don't you think you can\nprompt it to have intention? Basically start with\nthe initial conditions and get it going. You know, currently large language models, ChatGPT, only talks to\nyou when you talk to it. There's no reason why you\ncan't just start it talking. - But those initial conditions came from someone starting it, and that causal chain in there. So that intention comes from the outside. I think that there is something in that causal chain of\nintention that's super important. I don't disagree we're gonna get to AGI, it's a matter of when and what hardware. I think we're not gonna\ndo it in this hardware, and I think we're\nunnecessarily fetishizing really cool outputs and dopamine hits, because obviously that's\nwhat people wanna sell us. - I mean, AGI is a loaded term, but there could be incredibly super impressive intelligence\nsystems on the way to AGI. So these large language models, if it appears conscious, if it appears superintelligent, who are we to say it's not? - I agree. But superintelligence, I want to be able to have a discussion with it about coming up with fundamental new ideas that generate knowledge. And if the superintelligence\nwe generate can mine novelty from the future, that I didn't\nsee in its training set in the past, I would agree that something really interesting is coming on. I'll say that again, if the intelligence system, be it a human being, a chatbot, something else, is able to\nproduce something truly novel that I could not predict, even having a full audit\ntrail from the past, then I'll be sold. - Well, so it should be clear\nthat it can currently produce things that are in a shallow sense novel that are not in the training set. But you're saying truly novel? - I think they are in the training set. I think everything it produces\ncomes from a training set. There's a difference between\nnovelty and interpolation. We do not understand where\nthese leaps come from yet. That is what intelligence\nis, I would argue. Those leaps. And some people say, \"No, it's actually just what will happen if you\njust do cross-domain training and all that stuff.\" And that may be true, and I may be completely wrong. But right now, the human\nmind is able to mine novelty in a way that artificial\nintelligence systems cannot. And this is why we still have a job and we're still doing stuff. And, you know, I used\nChatGPT for a few weeks, \"Oh, this is cool.\" Well, what happened is,\nit took me too much time to correct it, then it got really good, and now they've done something to it. It's not actually that good. - [Lex] Yeah. Right. - I Don't know what's going on. - Censorship, yeah. I mean, that's interesting, but it will push us humans to\ncharacterize novelty better. Like, what is novel? What is truly novel? What's the difference between\nnovelty and interpolation? - I think that this is\nthe thing that makes me most excited about these technologies, is they're gonna help\nme demonstrate to you that time is fundamental and the unit future is\nbigger than the present, which is why human beings are quite good at generating novelty because we have to expand our data set and to cope with unexpected things in our environment. Our environment throws 'em all at us. Again, we have to survive\nin that environment. Never say never. I would be very interested in how we can get cross-domain training\ncheaply in chemical systems, 'cause I'm a chemist and the\nonly sentient thing I know of is the human brain, but maybe that's just me\nbeing boring and predictable and not novel."

      "section": "GPT for electron density",
      "text": "- Yeah, you mentioned\nGPT for electron density. So a GPT-like system\nfor generating molecules that can bind to host automatically. I mean, that's interesting. That's really interesting. Applying this to the same\nkind of transform mechanism. - Yeah. I try and do things that are non-obvious but non-obvious in certain areas. And one of the things I\nwas always asking about. In chemistry, people like to\nrepresent molecules as graphs. And it's quite difficult. Well, if you're doing AI and chemistry, you really want to basically\nhave good representations so you can generate new\nmolecules that are interesting. And I was thinking, well, molecules aren't really graphs and they're not\ncontinuously differentiable. Could I do something that was\ncontinuously differentiable? Well, I was like, \"Well,\nmolecules are actually made up of electron density.\" So then I got thinking, and said, \"Well, okay, could there be a way where we could just\nbasically take a database of readily solved electron densities for millions of molecules. So we took the electron density for millions of molecules\nand just trained the model to learn what electron density is. And so what we built was a system that you literally could give it a- Let's say you could take a protein that have a particular active site or, you know, a cup with a certain hole in it, and you pour noise into it, and with the GPT you turn the\nnoise into electron density. And then, in this case, it hallucinates, like all of them do. But the hallucinations are good because it means I don't have to train on such a huge data set, 'cause these data sets are very expensive. 'Cause how do you produce it? So go back a step. So you've got all these molecules in this data set, but what you've literally done is a quantum mechanical calculation where you produce electron\ndensities for each molecule. So you say, oh, this\nrepresentation of this molecule has these electron densities\nassociated with it, so you know what the representation is, and you train the neural\nnetwork should know what electron density is. So then you give it an unknown pocket, you pour in noise, and you say, right, produce me electron density. It produces electron density\nthat doesn't look ridiculous. And what we did in this case is we produce electron density that maximizes the\nelectrostatic potential, so the stickiness, but minimizes what we\ncall the steric hindrance, so the overlaps, so it's repulsive. So they, you know, make the perfect fit. And then, we then use a kind\nof like a ChatGPT type thing to turn that electron density\ninto what's called a smile. A smile string is a way of representing a molecule and letters. And then, we can then- - [Lex] So it just generates them then? - It just generates them. And then the other thing is, then we bung that into the computer and then it just makes it. - Yeah. The computer being the\nthing that, you're right, that could generate it.\n- Yeah, the robot that we've got that can basically just do chemistry. - Creating the-\n- Yeah. So we've kind of got this\nend-to-end drug discovery machine where you can say, oh, you want to bind to this active site? Here you go. I mean, it's a bit leaky\nand things kind of break, but it's the proof of principle. - But were the hallucinations,\nare those still accurate? - Well, the hallucinations\nare really great in this case. 'Cause in the case of\na large language model, hallucinations just make everything up. Well, it doesn't just make everything up, but it gives you an output that you're plausibly comfortable with and it thinks you're\ndoing probabilistically. The problem on these\nelectron density models is it's very expensive to\nsolve a Schrodinger equation going up to many heavy\natoms and large molecules. And so, we wondered if\nwe trained the system on up to nine heavy atoms, whether it would go beyond nine. And it did. It started to generate\nmolecules of 12, no problem. They looked pretty good. And I was like, \"Well, this\nhallucination I will take for free, thank you very much.\" This is a case where\ninterpolation extrapolation worked relatively well and we were able to generate\nthe really good molecules. And then, what we were able to do here is, and this is a really good point of what I was trying to say earlier, that we were able to\ngenerate new molecules from the known dataset that\nwould bind to the host, so a new guest would bind. Were these truly novel? Not really, because they\nwere constrained by the host. Were they new to us? Yes. So I do, well, understand. I can concede that\nmachine learning systems, artificial intelligence systems, can generate new entities. But how novel are they? It remains to be seen. - Yeah, and how novel the\nthings that humans generate is also difficult to quantify. They seem novel. - That's what a lotta people say. So the way to really\nget to genuine novelty, and assembly theory shows you the way, is to have different\ncausal chains overlap. And this really resonates with the time is fundamental argument. And if you're bringing\ntogether a couple of objects with different initial\nconditions coming together, when they interact, the more different their histories, the more novelty they generate\nin time going forward. And so, it could be that genuine novelty is basically about mix it up a little. And the human brain is\nable to mix it up a little, and all that stimulus\ncomes from the environment. But all I think I'm saying is the universe is deterministic\ngoing back in time, nondeterministic going forward in time, 'cause the universe is\ntoo big in the future to contain in the present. Therefore, these\ncollisions of known things generate unknown things\nthat then become part of your data set and don't appear weird. That's how we give ourselves comfort. The past looks consistent with this initial condition hypothesis, but actually we're generating\nmore and more novelty. And that's how it works. Simple. - (chuckles) So it's hard to quantify novelty looking backwards. I mean, the present and the future are the novelty generators. - But I like this whole\nidea of mining novelty. I think it is gonna reveal why the limitations of current AI is a bit like a printing press, right? Everyone thought that when\nthe printing press came, that writing books is gonna be terrible, that you had evil spirits and all this. They were just books. - And the same with AI. But I think just a scale you can achieve in terms of impact with AI\nsystems is pretty nerve-racking. - That's what the big\ncompanies want you to think. - But not like in terms\nof destroy all humans, but you can have major consequences in the way social media\nhas had major consequences, both positive and negative. And so, you have to kinda\nthink about and worry about it. But yeah, people that\nfearmonger, you know- - My pet theory for this, you wanna know? - [Lex] Yeah. - Is I think that a lotta, and I really do respect, you know, a lot of the people out there who are trying to have discourse\nabout the positive future, so OpenAI guys, Meta guys, and all this. What I wonder, if they're\ntrying to cover up for the fact that social media's had a pretty disastrous\neffect on some level, and they're just trying to say, ah yeah, we should do this. And covering up for the fact that we have got some problems with, you know, teenagers, and Instagram, and Snapchat, and, you know, all that stuff. And maybe they're just overreacting now. It's like, \"Oh yeah, sorry, we made the bubonic plague\nand gave it to you all, and you're all dying, and, oh yeah. But well, look at this over\nhere, it is even worse.\" - Yeah, there's a little bit of that. But there's also not enough celebration of the positive impact that all\nthese technologies have had. We tend to focus on the negative and tend to forget that- In part, because it's hard to measure. Like, it's very hard to measure the positive impact social\nmedia had on the world. - Yeah, I agree. What I worry about right now is like I do care about the ethics\nof what we're doing, and one of the reasons why I'm so open about the things we're\ntrying to do in the lab, make life, look at intelligence, all this, is so people say, \"What are\nthe consequences of this?\" And you say, \"What are the\nconsequences of not doing it?\" And I think that what\nworries me right now, in the present, is the\nlack of authenticated users and authenticated data and- - Human users.\n- Yeah, human- - I still think that\nthere will be AI agents that appear to be conscious, but they would have to\nbe also authenticated and labeled as such. 'Cause there's too much\nvalue in that, you know, like friendships with AI systems. There's too much meaningful\nhuman experiences to have with AI systems that I just... - But that's like a tool, right? It's a bit like a meditation tool, right? Some people have a meditation tool, it makes them feel better. But I'm not sure you can ascribe sentience and legal rights to a chatbot that makes you feel less lonely. - Sentience, yes. I think legal rights, no. I think it's the same. You can have a really deep\nmeaningful relationship with a dog and a pet. - Well, the dog's sentient. - [Lex] Yes. - The chatbot's right now, using the technology we use\nis not gonna be sentient. - Aah, that's gonna be a\nfun continued conversation on Twitter that I look forward to."

      "text": "Since you've had also, from another place, some debates that were inspired by the assembly theory paper, let me ask you about God. Is there any room for notions\nof God in assembly theory? Whose God? - Yeah, I don't know what God is. I mean, so God exists in our mind, created by selection. So human beings have\ncreated the concept of God in the same way that\nhuman beings have created the concept of superintelligence. - Sure. It still could mean\nthat that's a projection from the real world, where like we're just assigning words and concepts to a thing\nthat is fundamental to the real world. That there is something out there that is a creative force\nunderlying the universe. - There is a creative\nforce in the universe, but I don't think it's sentient. So, I do not understand the universe, so who am I to say, you\nknow, that God doesn't exist? I am an atheist, but I'm not an angry atheist, right? There are some people I\nknow that are angry atheists and say, you know-\n- Yeah, cranky. - Say that religious people are stupid. I don't think that's the case. Yeah, I have faith in some things, 'cause I mean, when I was a kid, you know, I was like, \"Well, I need to know what\nthe charge of a electron is.\" And I'm like, \"I can't measure\nthe charge of a electron.\" You know, I just gave up and had faith. Okay, you know, resistors worked. I want to know why the universe is growing in the future and what\nhumanity's gonna become. And I've seen that the\nacquisition of knowledge via the generation of\nnovelty to produce technology has uniformly made humans' lives better. I would love to continue that tradition. And- - You said that there's\nthat creative force. Just to think on that point, do you think there's a creative force? Is there like a thing, like a driver that's creating stuff? - So I think that- - And where? What is it? Can you describe like mathematical? - Well, I think selection. I think selection.\n- Selection is the force. - Selection is the force in the universe that creates novelty. - So is selection somehow fundamental? - Yeah. I think persistence of objects that could decay into nothing through operations that\nmaintain that structure. I mean, think about it. It's amazing that things exist at all, that we're just not a\nbig combinatorial mess. - [Lex] Yes. - So the fact that- - A thing that exists, persistent time. - Yeah. Let's think, maybe the universe is actually in the present. Everything that can exist\nin the present does exist. - Well, that would mean\nit's deterministic, right? - So the universe started super small, the past was deterministic, there wasn't much going on, and it was able to mine,\nmine, mine, mine, mine. And so the process, I mean, is somehow generating- The universe is basically- I'm trying to put this into words. - Did you just say there's\nno free will, though? - [Lee] No, I didn't say that. - 'Cause it everything that can exist- - Sorry. I said there is free will. I'm saying that free will\noccurs at the boundary between the- - The past and the future?\n- The past and the future. - Yeah, I got you. But everything that can exist does exist. - So, everything that's\npossible to exist at this- So, no. I'm really- - There's a lotta loaded words there. In that there's a time element\nloaded into that statement. - I think the universe\nis able to do what it can in the present, right?\n- Yeah. - And then, I think in the future, there are other things\nthat could be possible. We can imagine lots of things, but they don't all happen. - Sure. That's where you sneak in\nfree will, right there. - Yeah. So I guess what I'm saying is what exists is a convolution of the\npast with the present and the free will going into the future. - Well, we could still\nimagine stuff, right? We could imagine stuff\nthat will never happen. - And it's a amazing force. The most important thing\nthat we don't understand is our imaginations can actually change the future in a tangible way, which is what the initial conditions and physical cannot predict. Like, your imagination\nhas a causal consequence in the future. - Isn't that weird to you? - Yeah. - How do you- Hmm?\n- It does break the laws of physics as we know them right now. - Yeah. So you think the imagination has a causal effect on the future? - Yeah.\n- But it does exist in there, in the head. - It does, but-\n- And it must be a lot of power in whatever's going on. There could be a lot of power, whatever's going on in there. - If we then go back to\nthe initial conditions. It's simply not possible that can happen. But if we go into a\nuniverse where we accept that there is a finite\nability to represent numbers and you have rounding- Well, not rounding errors. What happens, your\nability to make decisions, imagine, and do stuff is at that interface between the certain and the uncertain. It's not, as Joscha was saying to me, randomness goes and you just, you know, randomly do random stuff. It is that you are set free\na little on your trajectory. Free will is about being able to explore on this narrow trajectory that allows you to build. You have a choice about what you build. Or that choice is you interacting with a future in the present. - What to you is most beautiful\nabout this whole thing? The universe? - The fact it seems to be\nvery undecided, very open. The fact that every time I\nthink I'm getting towards an answer to a question, there are so many more questions that make the chase, you know? - Do you hate that it's gonna\nbe over at some point for you? - Well, for me. I think if you think about it, is it over for Newton now? Newton has had causal\nconsequences in the future. We discuss him all the time. - His ideas, but not the person. - The person just had a lot of causal power when he was alive. But, oh my God, one of\nthe things I wanna do is leave as many Easter eggs in the future when I'm gone to go, \"Oh, that's cool.\" - Would you be very upset if somebody made like a good large language model that's fine-tuned to Lee Cronin? - It would be quite boring 'cause I mean- - [Lex] No novelty generation? - If it's a faithful\nrepresentation of what I've done in my life, that's great. That's a interesting artifact. But I think the most interesting thing about knowing each other is we don't know what we're gonna do next. - Sure. (sighs) Sure. - I mean, within some constraints, I can predict some things about you, you can predict some things about me, but we can't predict everything. - [Lex] Everything. - And it's because we\ncan't predict everything is why we're excited to come\nback, and discuss, and see. So yeah, it'll be\ninteresting that some things that I've done can be captured, but I'm pretty sure that\nmy angle on mining novelty from the future will not be captured. - Yeah. Yeah. So that's what life is, it's just some novelty generation, and then you're done. Each one of us just generate a little bit. Or have the capacity to, at least. - Selection produces life and\nlife affects the universe, and universes with life\nin them are materially and physically fundamentally different than universes without life. And that's super interesting. And I have no beginnings of understanding. I think maybe this is like in 1000 years, there'll be a new discipline, and the humans will be like, \"Yeah, of course, this is\nhow it all works, right? - In retrospect, it will\nall be obvious, I think. - I think assembly theory is obvious, that's why a lot of\npeople got angry, right? They were like, \"Oh my God,\nthis is such nonsense.\" - Yeah.\n- You know, and like, \"Oh, you know, actually, it's not quite, but the writing's really bad.\" - Well, I can't wait to\nsee where it evolves, Lee. And I'm glad I get to exist\nin this universe with you, you're a fascinating human. This is always a pleasure.

So maybe I can try to\nsummarize assembly theory and you tell me if I'm wrong. - [Lee] Go for it. - So assembly theory says that if we look at any object in the universe, any object, that we can quantify how complex it is by trying to find the number\nof steps it took to create it. And also, we can determine if it was built by a process akin to evolution by looking at how many copies\nof the object there are. - [Lee] Yeah, that's spot on. - Spot on?\n- Spot on. - I was not expecting that. Okay, so let's go through definitions. So there's a central equation\nI'd love to talk about, but definition-wise, what is an object? - (chuckles) Yeah, an object. So if I'm gonna try to be\nas meticulous as possible, objects need to be finite and they need to be\ndecomposable into subunits. All human-made artifacts are objects. Is a planet an object? Probably yes, if you scale out. So an object is finite and\ncountable and decomposable, I suppose mathematically. But, yeah, I still wake up some days and think to myself what is an object? Because it's a nontrivial question. - \"Persists over time.\" I'm quoting from the paper here. \"An object is finite, is distinguishable.\" So that's a weird adjective. \"Distinguishable.\" (chuckles) - We've had so many people help offering to rewrite the paper after it came out. Yeah, you wouldn't believe,\nit's so funny. (laughing) - \"Persists over time\nand is breakable such that the set of\nconstraints to construct it from elementary building\nblocks is quantifiable. Such that the set of\nconstraints to construct it from elementary building\nblocks is quantifiable.\" - The history is in the objects. It's kind of cool, right? - Okay, so what defines the object is it's history or memory, whichever is the sexier word. - I'm happy with both,\ndepending on the day. (laughing) - Okay. So, \"the set of steps it\ntook to create the object.\" So there's a sense in which every object in the universe has a history, and that is part of the thing that is used to describe its complexity. How complicated it is.\n- Yeah. Okay, what is an assembly index? - So the assembly index, if you're to take the object apart and be super lazy about it or minimal, 'cause, you know, it's like you've got a really short-term memory,. So what you do is you lay all the parts on the path and you\nfind the minimum number of steps you take on the path\nto add the parts together to reproduce the object, and that minimum number\nis the assembly index. There's a minimum bound. And it was always my\nintuition the minimum bound and assembly theory was really important, and only worked out why a few weeks ago, which is kind of funny, because I was just like,\n\"No this is sacrosanct. I dunno why. It'll come to me one day.\" And then when I was pushed\nby a bunch of mathematicians, we came up with the correct\nphysical explanation, which I can get to, but it's the minimum, and it's really important, is the minimum. And the reason I knew\nthe minimum was right is 'cause we could measure it. So almost before this paper came out, we published papers,\nexplain how you can measure the assembly index of molecules. - Okay, so that's not so\ntrivial to figure out. So when you look at an object, we could say a molecule, we could say object more generally. To figure out the minimum number of steps it takes to create that object, that doesn't seem like\na trivial thing to do. - So with molecules, it's not trivial, but it is possible\nbecause what you can do. And because I'm a chemist, so I'm kind of like I\nsee the lens of the world through just chemistry. I break the molecule apart, break bonds. And if you take a molecule\nand you break it all apart you have a bunch of atoms, and then you say okay I'm\ngoing to then take the atoms and form bonds and go up the chain of events to make the molecule. And that's what made me realize, take a toy example,\nliterally a toy example, take a Lego object which is\nbroken up of Lego blocks. So you could do exactly the same thing. In this case, the Lego blocks\nare naturally the smallest, they're the atoms in the actual\ncomposite Lego architecture. But then, if you maybe take, you know, a couple of blocks and put\nthem together in a certain way, maybe they're offset in some way. That offset is on the memory, you can use that offset again\nwith only a penalty of one, and you can then make a square,\ntriangle, and keep going. And you remember those\nmotifs on the chain. So you can then leap from the start, with all the Lego blocks or atoms just laid out in front of you and say right, I'll take you, you, you, connect, and do the least amount of work. So it's really like the\nsmallest steps you can take on the graft to make the object. And so for molecules, it\ncame relatively intuitively, and then we started to\napply it to language. We've even started to apply\nit to mathematical theorems. But I'm so well outta my depth. But it looks like you can\ntake a minimum set of axioms and then start to build up kind of mathematical architectures\nin the same way, and then the shortest path to get there is something interesting\nthat I don't yet understand. - So what's the computational complexity of figuring out the shortest\npath with molecules, with language, with mathematical theorems? It seems like once you have the fully constructed Lego castle or whatever your favorite Lego world is, figuring out how to get there from the basic building blocks. Is that hard problem? - It's a hard problem, but actually if you look at it. So the best way to look at it. For this, take a molecule. So if the molecule has 13 bonds, first of all take 13\ncopies of the molecule and just cut all the\nbonds, so cut 12 bonds, and then you just put them in order. And then, that's how it works. And you keep looking\nfor symmetry or copies, so you can then shorten it as you go down, and that becomes\ncombinatorially quite hard. For some natural product molecules, it becomes very hard. It's not impossible, but we're looking at the\nbounds on that at the moment. But as the object gets bigger, it becomes really hard. And the that's bad news. But the good news is there are shortcuts. And we might even be able\nto physically measure the complexity without\ncomputationally calculating it, which is kind of insane. - [Lex] Wait, wait, how would you do that? - Well, in the case of a molecule, so if you shine light on a molecule, let's take it infrared, the molecule has each of the bonds absorbs the infrared differently in with what we call the fingerprint region. And because it's quantized as well, you have all these discreet\nkind of absorbances. And my intuition, after we realized we could\ncut molecules up in mass spec, that was the first go at this. We did it with using infrared. And the infrared gave us an even better correlation assembly index. And we used another technique as well in addition to infrared, called NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance, which tells you about the number of different magnetic\nenvironments in a molecule, and that also worked out. So we have three techniques which each of them independently gives us the same, or tending towards the same, assembly index from a molecule that we can calculate mathematically. - [Lex] Okay, so these are all methods of mass spectrometry, mass spec. You scan a molecule, it gives you data in the form of a mass spectrum. And you're saying that the data correlates to the assembly index? - [Lee] Yeah. - How generalizable is that shortcut, first of all to chemistry, and second of all beyond that? 'Cause that seems like a nice hack, and you're extremely knowledgeable about various aspects of chemistry, so you can say, okay, it kinda correlates. But, you know, the whole idea\nbehind assembly theory paper and perhaps why it's so controversial is that it reaches bigger, it reaches for the bigger general theory of objects in the universe. - Yeah, I'd say so. I'd agree. So, I've started assembly theory of emoticons with my\nlab, believe it or not. So we take emojis, pixelate them, and work out the assembly\nindex of the emoji, and then work out how\nmany emojis you can make on the path of the emoji. So there's the uber emoji from which all other emojis emerge, so you can then take a photograph, and by looking at the shortest path, by reproducing the pixels\nto make the image you want, you can measure that. So then you start to be\nable to take spatial data. Now there's some problems there. What is then the definition of the object? How many pixels? How do you break it down? And so we're just learning\nall this right now. - How do you begin to\ncompute the assembly index of a graphical like a set\nof pixels on a 2D plane that form a thing? - So you would first of all\ndetermine the resolution. What is your XY, and what are the number\non the X and Y plane, and then look at the surface area, and then you take all your emojis and make sure they're all\nlooked at the same resolution, and then we would basically then do exactly the same thing we\nwould do for cutting the bonds. You'd cut bits out of the emoji. You'd have a bag of pixels, and you would then add\nthose pixels together to make the overall emoji. - Wait, wait a minute. But, like, first of all, I mean, this is at the core\nsort of machine learning and computer vision. Not every pixel's that important. And there's like macro features, there's micro features and\nall that kind of stuff. - [Lee] Exactly. - Like, you know, the eyes\nappear in a lot of them, the smile appears in a lot of them. - So in the same way in chemistry we assume the bond is fundamental. What we're doing here is\nwe assume the resolution at the scale at which\nwe do it is fundamental, and we are just working that out. And you are right, that\nwill change, right? Because as you take your lens out a bit, it will change dramatically. But it's just a new way of looking at not just compression, what we do right now in\ncomputer science and data, one big kind of misunderstanding as assembly theory is telling you about how compressed the object is. That's not right. It's a how much information is required on a chain of events. 'Cause the nice thing is, when you do compression\nin computer science, we're wandering a bit here, but it's kind of worth wandering I think. And you assume you have\ninstantaneous access to all the information in the memory. In assembly theory, you say, no, you don't get access to that memory until you've done the work. And then when you've done\naccess to that memory, you can have access but\nnot to the next one. And this is how in assembly theory we talk about the four universes, the assembly universe,\nthe assembly possible, and the assembly contingent, and then the assembly observed. And they're all scales in\nthis combinatorial universe. - Yeah. Can you explain each one of them? - Yep, so the assembly\nuniverse is like anything goes, It's just combinatorial kind\nof explosion in everything. - [Lex] So that's the biggest one? - [Lee] That's the\nbiggest one. It's massive. - Assembly universe, assembly possible, assembly contingent, assembly observed, and the y-axis is assembly steps in time. And, you know, and the X-axis is as the thing expands through time, more and more unique objects appear. - So assembly universe, everything goes. Assembly possible, laws\nof physics come in. In this case, in chemistry bonds. So that means- - [Lex] Those are extra\nconstraints, I guess. - Yes, and they're the only constraints. They're the constraints at the base. So the way to look at is\nyou've got all your atoms, they're quantized and you\ncan just bang them together. So in the way in computer science speak, I suppose the assembly universe is just like no laws of physics, things can fly through mountains, beyond the speed of light. In the assembly possible, you have to apply the laws of physics, but you can get access to all\nthe motifs instantaneously with no effort. So that means you could make anything. Then the assembly contingent says, no, you can't have access to\nthe highly assembled object in the future until you've\ndone the work in the past on the causal chain, and that's really the\nreally interesting shift where you go from assembly\npossible to assembly contingent. That is really the key\nthing in assembly theory that says you cannot just\nhave instantaneous access to all those memories. You have to have done the work somehow, the universe has to have somehow built a system that allows\nyou to select that path rather than other paths. And then the final thing, the assembly observed\nis basically us saying, oh, these are the things we actually see. We can go backwards now and understand that they have been created\nby this causal process. - But wait a minute. So when you say the\nuniverse has to construct the system that does the work, is that like the environment that allows for, like, selection? - Yeah.\n- So that's the thing that does the selection? - You could think about in terms of a Von Neumann constructor\nversus a selection of ribosome, Tesla as a plant,\nassembling Teslas, you know? The difference between the\nassembly universe in Tesla land and the Tesla factory is everyone says, \"No, Teslas are just easy,\nthey just spring out. You know how to make them all.\" At Tesla factory, you have\nto put things in sequence and out comes a Tesla. - So you're talking about the factory? - Yes. This is this is really nice. Super important point is that when I talk about the universe having a memory or there's some magic, it's not that. It's that tells you that there must be a process encoded somewhere in physical reality, be it a cell, a Tesla factory, or something else that is making that object. I'm not saying there's\nsome kind of woo-woo memory in the universe, you know,\nmorphic resonance or something, I'm saying that there is\nan actual causal process that is being directed,\nconstrained in some way. So it's not kind of\njust making everything. - Yeah, but, Lee, what's the factory that made the factory? So first of all, you\nassume the laws of physics has just sprung to\nexistence at the beginning. Those are constraints. But what makes the factory the environment that does the selection? - Well, it's the first\ninteresting question that I want to answer out of four. I think the factory\nemerges in the interplay between the environment and the objects that are being built. I'll have a go at explaining\nto you the shortest path. So why is the shortest path important? I'm gonna have to go with\nchemistry for a moment then abstract it. So imagine you've got\nan given environment, that you have a budget of atoms you're just flinging together. And the objective of those atoms that are being flung together, in say molecule A, they decompose. So molecules decompose over time. So the molecules in this environment, in this magic environment, have to not die, but they do die. They have a half-life. So the only way the\nmolecules can get through that environment out the other side. Let's pretend the environment is a box, you can go in and out without dying. And there's just an infinite\nsupply of atoms coming, well, a large supply. The molecule gets built, but the molecule is able to\ntemplate itself being built and survives in the environment, will basically reign supreme. Now let's say that that\nmolecule takes 10 steps and it's using a finite\nset of atoms, right? Now let's say another molecule, smart-ass molecule\nwe'll call it, comes in, and can survive in that\nenvironment and can copy itself, but it only needs five steps. The molecule that only needs five steps, 'cause both molecules are being destroyed but they're creating themselves faster than they can be destroyed, you can see that the\nshortest path reigns supreme. So the shortest path tells us\nsomething super interesting about the minimal amount\nof information required to propagate that motif in time and space, and it seems to be like some\nkind of conservation law. - So one of the intuitions you have is the propagation of motifs, in time, will be done by the things\nthat can construct themselves in the shortest path. So like, you can assume\nthat most of the objects in the universe are built\nin the most efficient way? Big leap I just took there. - Yes and no, because\nthere are other things. So in the limit, yes, because you want to tell the difference between things that\nhave required a factory to build them and just random processes. But you can find instances where the shortest path isn't taken for an individual object,\na individual function. And people go, \"Ah, that means the shortest path isn't right.\" And then I say, \"Well, I don't know, I think it's right still because there are other driving forces, so it's not just one molecule. Now that you start to\nconsider two objects, you have a joint assembly space, and now it's a compromise between not just making A\nand B in the shortest path, you wanna be able to make A\nand B in the shortest path, which might mean that\nA is slightly longer. You have a compromise. So when you see slightly more nesting in the construction when\nyou take a given object that can look longer, well, that's because the overall function is the object is still\ntrying to be efficient. And this is still very hand-wavy. I maybe have no legs to stand on, but we think we're getting\nsomewhere with that. - And there's probably some\nparallelization, right? - Yeah.\n- So this is not sequential, the building is. Yeah, I guess-\n- No, you're right. - When you're talking\nabout complex objects, you don't have to work sequentially, you can work in parallel. You can get your friends\ntogether and they can- - Yeah. And the thing we're working on right now is how to understand\nthese parallel processes. Now there's a new thing we've introduced called assembly depth. And assembly depth can be lower than the assembly index for a molecule when they're cooperating together, 'cause exactly, parallel\nprocessing is going on. And my team have been working\nthis out in the last few weeks because we're looking at\nwhat compromises does nature need to make when it's\nmaking molecules in a cell. And I wonder if, you know, I'm maybe like, well, I'm always leaping\nout of my competence, but in economics, I'm just wondering if you could apply this in an economic process. It seems like capitalism is very good at finding the shortest\npath, you know, every time. And there are ludicrous things that happen because actually the cost\nfunction's been minimized. And so I keep seeing parallels everywhere where there are complex nested systems, where if you give it enough time and you introduce a bit of heterogeneity, the system readjusts and\nfinds a new shortest path. But the shortest path isn't\nfixed on just one molecule now, it's in the actual existence\nof the object over time. And that object could be a city, it could be a cell, it could be a factory. But I think we're going\nway beyond molecules and my competence, so probably we should\ngo back to molecules. But, hey. - All right, before we get too far, let's talk about the assembly equation. Okay, how should we do this? Lemme just even read\nthat part of the paper. \"We define assembly as the total amount of selection necessary\nto produce an ensemble of observed objects,\nquantified using equation 1.\" The equation basically has A on one side, which is the assembly of the ensemble, and then a sum from 1 to N, where N is the total\nnumber of unique objects. And then there is a\nfew variables in there, that include the assembly index, the copy number, which we'll talk about. I don't remember you talking about that. That's an interesting addition, and I think a powerful one. Has to do with that you can create pretty\ncomplex objects randomly. And in order to know\nthat they're not random, that there's a factory involved, you need to see a bunch of them. That's the intuition there. It's a interesting intuition. And then some normalization. What else is a N? - N - 1. Just to make sure that one object could be a one-off and random. And then you have more\nthan one identical object. That's interesting. - When there's two of a thing. That's interesting.\n- Two of a thing is super important, especially if the assembly index is high. - So we could say several questions here. One, let's talk about selection. What is this term, selection? What is this term, evolution,\nthat we're referring to? Which aspect of Darwinian evolution are we referring to\nthat's interesting here? - Yeah so, you know the paper, we should talk about\nthe paper for a second. The paper, what it did\nis it kind of annoyed- We didn't annoy. I mean, it got the attention, and obviously the angry\npeople were annoyed. - There's angry people in\nthe world. That's good. - So what happened is the\nevolutionary biologists got angry. We were not expecting that. 'Cause we thought evolutionary\nbodies would be cool. I knew that some, not many, computational complexity\npeople will get angry, 'cause I've kinda been poking them, and maybe I deserved it. But I was trying to poke\nthem in a productive way. And then the physicists kind of got grumpy because the initial\nconditions tell everything. The prebiotic chemist got slightly grumpy because there's not\nenough chemistry in there. And then finally, when\nthe creationist said it wasn't creationist enough, I was like, I've done my job. - Because you're basically saying that physics is not\nenough to tell the story of how biology emerges. - I think so.\n- And then they said a few physics is the beginning\nand the end of the story. - Yeah. So what happened is the\nreason why people put the phone down on the call of the paper. I mean, if you're the reading the paper like a phone call, they\ngot to the abstract. And in the abstract- - [Lex] First sentence is pretty strong. - The first two sentences\ncaused everybody- - \"Scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution with the immutable laws of the\nuniverse defined by physics.\" - True, right? There's nothing wrong with that statement. Totally true. - Yeah.\n- Next one. \"These laws underpin life's origin, evolution and the development of human culture and technology, yet they do not predict the\nemergence of these phenomena.\" Wow. First of all, we should\nsay the title of the paper. This paper was accepted\nand published in \"Nature\". The title is \"Assembly theory explains and quantifies selection and evolution\". A very humble title. And the entirety of the paper I think presents interesting\nideas but reaches high. - I would do it all again. This paper was actually\non the preprint server for over a year. - You regret nothing. - I think, yeah, I don't regret anything. - You and Frank Sinatra did it your way. - What I love about being a scientist is kind of sometimes, 'cause I'm a bit dim and I don't understand\nwhat people are telling me. I wanna get to the point. This paper says, hey, the laws\nof physics are really cool, the universe is great, but it's not intuitive that you just run the standard model and get life out. I think most physicists might go, yeah, you know, we can't just go back and say that's what happened 'cause physics can't explain\nthe origin of life yet. That doesn't mean it won't or can't, okay? Just to be clear, sorry, intelligent designers,\nwe are gonna get there. Second point, we say that evolution works but we don't know how evolution got going, so biological evolution\nand biological selection. So for me, this seems\nlike a simple continuum. So when I mentioned\nselection and evolution in the title, I think,\nand in the abstract, we should have maybe prefaced that and said nonbiological selection and nonbiological evolution, and then that might have made\nit even more crystal clear. But I didn't think that\nevolutionary biology should be so bold to claim ownership of selection and evolution. And secondly, a lot of\nevolutionary biologists seem to dismiss the\norigin of life question, just say it's obvious. And that causes a real\nproblem scientifically. When the physicists are like, we own the universe, the universe is good, we explain all of it, look at us. And the biologists say\nwe can explain biology. And the poor chemist in the middle going, but, hang on. (laughing) And this paper kinda says, hey, there is an interesting disconnect between physics and biology. And that's at the point at which memories get made in chemistry through bonds. And hey, let's look at this close and see if we can quantify it. So yeah, I mean I never expected the paper to kind of get that much interest. And still, I mean it's only been published just over a month ago now. - So just to link on the selection. What is the broader sense\nof what selection means? - Yeah, that's a really good. For selection, so this is where for me the concept of an object is\nsomething that can persist in time and not die, but\nbasically can be broken up. So if I was gonna kind of bolster the definition of an objects. So if something can form and persist for a long period of time\nunder an existing environment that could destroy other, and I'm gonna use anthropomorphic terms, I apologize, but weaker\nobjects or less robust, then the environment\ncould have selected that. So a good chemistry example is if you took some carbon and you made a chain of carbon atoms. Whereas, if you took some, I don't know, some carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen and made chains from those, you'd start to get different\nreactions and rearrangements. So a chain of carbon atoms\nmight be more resistant to falling apart under\nacidic or basic conditions versus another set of molecules. So it survives in that environment. So the acid pond the resistant\nmolecule can get through. And then that molecule goes\ninto another environment. So that environment now\nmaybe being acid pond is a basic pond, or maybe\nit's an oxidizing pond. And so, if you've got carbon and it goes in an oxidizing pond, maybe the carbon starts to\noxidize and break apart. So you go through all these\nkind of obstacle courses, if you like, given by reality. So selection happens\nwhen a object survives in an environment for some time. But, and this is the\nthing that's super subtle, the object has to be\ncontinually being destroyed and made by a process. So it's not just about the object now, it's about the process\nand time that makes it. 'Cause a rock could just\nstand on the mountainside for four billion years and\nnothing happened to it. And that's not necessarily\nreally advanced selection. So for selection to\nget really interesting, you need to have a turnover in time. You need to be continually\ncreating objects, producing them, what\nwe call discovery time. So there's a discovery time for an object. When that object is discovered, if it's say a molecule, that can then act on itself or the chain of events that caused itself to bolster its formation, then you go from discovery\ntime to production time, and suddenly you have more\nof it in the universe, so it could be a\nself-replicating molecule. And the interaction of the\nmolecule in the environment, in the warm little pond\nor in the sea or wherever, in the bubble, could then start to build a\nproto factory, the environment. So really, to answer your question, what the factory is. The factory is the environment, but it's not very autonomous, it's not very redundant, there's lots of things\nthat could go wrong. So once you get high\nenough up the hierarchy of networks of interactions, something needs to happen, that needs to be compressed\ninto a smaller volume and made resistant or robust. Because in biology, selection and evolution is robust. That you have error correction built in. You have really, you know, there's good ways of basically making sure propagation goes on. So really the difference between inorganic abiotic\nselection and evolution, and evolution and stuff\nin biology is robustness, the ability to survive in lots\nof different environments. Whereas, our poor little\ninorganic soul molecule, whatever, just dies in lots of\ndifferent environments. So there's something\nsuper special that happens from the inorganic molecule\nin the environment, it kills it, to where you've got evolution and cells can survive everywhere. - Well, how special is that? How do you know those\nkinds of evolution factors aren't everywhere in the universe? - I don't. And I'm excited, 'cause I think selection isn't special at all. I think what is special is the history of the environments on earth that gave rise to the first cell that now, you know, has taken all those environments and is now more autonomous. And I would like to think that, you know, this paper could be very wrong, (chuckles) but I don't think it's very wrong. It mean, it's certainly wrong, but it's less wrong than some\nother ideas I hope, right? And if this inspires us to go and look for selection in the universe, 'cause we now have an equation where we can say we can\nlook for selection going on and say, oh, that's interesting, we seem to have a process that's giving us high copy number objects that also are highly complex. But that doesn't look\nlike life as we know it. And we use that and say, \"oh, there's a hydrothermal vent. Or there's a process going on, there's molecular networks.\" Because the assembly\nequation is not only meant to identify at the higher\nend, advanced selection. What you get, I would call it in biology, your super advanced selection. And even, I mean, you could\nuse the assembly equation to look for technology and God forbid, we could talk about\nconsciousness and abstraction, but let's keep it primitive,\nmolecules and biology. So I think the real power\nof the assembly equation is to say how much selection\nis going on in this space. And there's a really simple\nthought experiment I could do. Is, you know, have a little petri dish, and on that petri dish,\nyou put some simple food. So the assembly index of all the sugars and everything is quite low. And you put a single E. coli cell. And then you say, I'm\ngonna I'm gonna measure this amount of assembly in the box. So it's quite low, but the rate of change of assembly, the ADT will go, voom sigmoidal as it eats all the food. And the number of E.\ncoli cells will replicate because they take all the food, they can copy themselves, the assembly index of all the molecules goes up, up, up, and up until the food is exhausted in the box. So now the E. coli's stop. I mean, die is probably a strong word. They stop respiring 'cause\nall the food has gone. But suddenly the amount\nof assembly in the box has gone up gigantically because\nof that one E. coli factory has just eaten through, milled lots of other E. coli factories, run out of food and stopped. So in the initial box, although the amount of\nassembly was really small, it was able to replicate and\nuse all the food and go up. And that's what we're trying\nto do in the lab actually, is kinda make those kind of experiments and see if we can spot the emergence of molecular networks that\nare producing complexity as we feed in raw materials and we feed a challenge, an environment, you know, we try and kill the molecules. And really that's the main kind of idea for the entire paper. - Yeah, and see if you\ncan measure the changes in the assembly index\nthroughout the whole system. Okay, what about if I\nshow up to a new planet, we go to Mars or some other planet from a different solar system, how do we use assembly index\nthere to discover alien life? - Very simply actually. Let's say we'll go to Mars\nwith a mass spectrometer with a sufficiently high resolution. So what you'll have to be able to do- So a good thing about mass spec is that you can select the\nmolecule from the mass, and then, if it's high enough resolution, you can be more and more sure that you're just seeing identical copies. You can count them. And then you fragment them and you count the number of fragments and look at the molecular weight. And the higher the molecular weight and the higher the number of fragments, the higher the assembly index. So if you go to Mars\nand you take a mass spec with a high enough resolution\nand you can find molecules, and I'll give a guide on earth, if you could find molecules say greater than 350 molecular weight\nwith more than 15 fragments, you have found artifacts\nthat can only be produced, at least on earth, by life. And now you would say, oh, well, maybe the geological process. I would argue very vehemently\nthat that is not the case. But we can say, look, if you don't like the cutoff on earth, go up higher, 30, 100, right? Because there's gonna be a point where you'll find a molecule with\nso many different parts the chances of you getting a molecule that has 100 different parts and finding a million identical copies, you know, that's just impossible, that could never happen in\nan infinite set of universes. - Can you just linger on\nthis copy number thing? A million different copies. What do you mean by copies, and why is the number of copies important? - Yeah, that was so interesting. I always understood the copy\nnumber was really important but I never explained\nit properly for ages. It goes back to this. If I give you a, I dunno, a really complicated molecule and I say it's complicated, you could say, hey,\nthat's really complicated, but is it just really random? And so I realized that ultimate randomness and ultimate complexity\nare indistinguishable until you can see a\nstructure in the randomness. So you can see copies. - So copies implies structure. - [Lee] Yeah, the factory. - I mean, there's a deep\nprofound thing in there. 'Cause, like, if you just\nhave a random process, you're going to get a lotta complex, beautiful sophisticated things. What makes them complex\nin the way we think life is complex or something like a factory that's operating under\na selection processes, there should be copies. Is there like some looseness about copies? Like, what does it mean for\ntwo objects to be equal? - It's all to do with the the telescope or the microscope you're using. And so, at the maximum resolution. So then the nice thing about chemists is they have this concept of the molecule and they're all familiar\nwith the molecule, and molecules you can hold, you know, on your hand, lots of\nthem, identical copies. A molecule's actually a super\nimportant thing in chemistry. To say, look, you can\nhave a mole of a molecule, so an Avogadro's number of\nmolecules and they're identical. What does that mean? That means that the molecular composition, the bonding and so on, the configuration is indistinguishable. You can hold them together, you can overlay them. So the way I do it is if I say, here's a bag of 10 identical molecules, let's prove they're identical. You pick one out of the bag and you basically observe\nit using some technique, and then you take it away, and then you take another one out. If you observe it using technique and you see no differences,\nthey're identical. It's really interesting to get right, because if you take say two molecules. Molecules can be in different vibrational and rotational states, they're moving all the time. So with this respect, identical molecules\nhave identical bonding. In this case, we don't\neven talk about chirality 'cause we don't have a chirality detector. So two identical molecules in one conception assembly theory, basically considers both\nhands as being the same. But of course, they're\nnot, they're different. As soon as you have a chiral distinguisher to detect the left and the right hand, they become different. And so it's to do with\nthe detection system that you have and the resolution. - So I wonder if there's an art in science to which detection system is used when you show up to a new planet? So like, you're talking\nabout chemistry a lot today. We have kind of standardized\ndetection systems, right? Of how to compare molecules. So, you know, when you\nstart to talk about emojis, and language, and mathematical theorems, and, I don't know, more\nsophisticated things at different scale, at a smaller scale than molecules, at a larger\nscale of than molecules. Like if we look at the\ndifference between you and me, Lex and Lee, are we the same? Are we different? - Sure, I mean of course\nwe're different close up, but if you zoom out a little bit, it will morphologically look the same. You know, high in characteristics, hair length, stuff like that. - Well, also like the species. - [Lee] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And also, there's a sense\nwhy we're both from earth. - Yeah, I agree. I mean, this is the power of\nassembly theory in that regard. So the way to look at it, if you have a box of objects, if they're all indistinguishable, we're using your technique, what you then do is you then\nlook at the assembly index. Now, if the assembly index\nof them is really low, right? And they're all indistinguishable, then they're telling you that you have to go to another resolution. You know, it's kind of a sliding scale. It's kind of nice.\n- Yeah, got it. So those two kind of are\nat tension with each other, the number of copies\nin the assembly index. - [Lee] Yeah. - That's really, really interesting. So okay, so you show up to a new planet, you'll be doing what? - [Lee] I would do mass spec. - On a sample of what? First of all, like how big\nof a scoop do you take? Do you just take a scoop? So we're looking for primitive life. - Yeah, so if you're just going to Mars or Titan or Enceladus or somewhere. So a number of ways of doing it. So you could take a large scoop or you go through the\natmosphere and detect stuff. And you could make a life meter, right? One of Sara's colleagues,\nan ASU, Paul Davies, keeps calling it a life meter. Which is quite a nice idea, because if you think about it, if you've got a living system that's producing these\nhighly complex molecules and they drift away\nand they're in a highly kind of demanding environment, they could be burnt, right? So they could just be falling apart. So you want to sniff a\nlittle bit of complexity and say, warmer, warmer, warmer. Oh, we've found life. We've found the alien. We found the alien Elon\nMusk smoking a joint in the bottom of the cave on Mars, or Elon himself, whatever, right? And say, okay, found it. So what you can do is\nthe mass spectrometer, you could just look for\nthings in the gas phase, or you go on the surface, drill down, because you want to\nfind molecules that are- You've either gotta find\nthe source living system, because the problem with\njust looking for complexity is it gets burnt away. So in a harsh environment, on, say, the surface of Mars, there's a very low probability that you're gonna find\nreally complex molecules because of all the radiation and so on. If you drill down a little bit, you could drill down a bit into soil that's billions of years old, then I would put in some\nsolvent, water, alcohol, or something, or take a scoop, make it volatile, put it\ninto the mass spectrometer, and just try and detect a high complexity, high abundant molecules. And if you get them, hey presto, you can have evidence of life. Wouldn't that then be\ngreat if you could say, okay, we found evidence of life, now we want to keep the\nlife meter keep searching for more and more complexity until you actually find living cells. You can get those new living cells, and then you could\nbring them back to earth or you could try and sequence them. You could see that they have\ndifferent DNA and proteins. - Go along on the gradient\nof the life meter. How would you build a life meter? Let's say we're together starting a new- - Just a mass spectrometer.\n- A new company launching a life meter.\n- A mass spectrometer would be the first way of doing it. Just take-\n- No, no, no. But that's one of the\nmajor components of it. But I'm talking about like, what if it's a device, and branding, logo, we gotta talk through that. That's later. But what's the input? Like how do you get to a metered output? - So, I would take my life\nmeter, our life meter. There you go.\n- Thank you. - Yeah, you're welcome. Would have both infrared and mass spec. So it would have two ports, so we could shine the light. And so what it would do is you\nwould have a vacuum chamber, and you would have an\nelectrostatic analyzer, and you'd have a monochromator\nto producing infrared. So you'd take a scoop of the sample, put it in the life meter. It would then add a solvent\nor heat up the sample so some volatiles come off. The volatiles would then be put into the mass spectrometer into the electrostatic trap, and you'd weigh the\nmolecules and fragment them. Alternatively, you'd shine\ninfrared light on them and count the number of bands. But you'd have to, in that case, do some separation, 'cause you want to separate in- And so, in mass spec, it's really nice and convenient 'cause you can separate electrostatically, but you need to have that. - Can you do it in real time? - Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, so let's go all the way back. Okay, we really gonna get\nthe Lex and Lee's life meter. - Oh yeah, Lex and Lee. It's good ring to it. - All right, so you have a vacuum chamber, you have a little nose. The nose would have a packing material. So you would take your sample, add it onto the nose,\nadd a solvent or a gas. It would then be sucked up the nose and that would separated using\nwhat we call chromatography. And then, as each band comes off the nose, we'll then do mass spec and infrared. And in the case of the infrared, count the number of bands. In the case of mass spec, count the number of\nfragments and weigh it. And then, the further up\nin molecular weight range for the mass spec and the number of bands, you go up and up and\nup from the, you know, dead, interesting, interesting,\nover the threshold, oh my gosh, earth life. And then right up to the batshit crazy, this is definitely, you know, alien intelligence that's\nmade this life, right? You could almost go all the way there. Same with the infrared. And it's pretty simple. The thing that is really problematical is that for many years, decades, what people have done,\nand I can't blame them, is they've rather been\nobsessing about small biomarkers that we find on earth, amino acids, like single amino acids or evidence of small molecules and these things, and looking for those rather\nthat looking for complexity. The beautiful thing about\nthis is you can look for complexity without\nearth chemistry bias or earth biology bias. So assembly theory is\njust a way of saying, hey, complexity in abundance\nis evidence of selection, that's how our universal\nlife media will work. - Complexity in abundance\nis evidence of selection. Okay, so let's apply\nour life meter to earth. You know, if we were just to apply assembly index\nmeasurements to earth, what kinda stuff are we going to get? What's impressive about some\nof the complexity on earth? - So we did this a few years ago when I was trying to\nconvince NASA and colleagues that this technique could work. And honestly, it's so funny\nbecause everyone's like, \"No, ain't gonna work.\" Because a chemist was saying, \"Of course there are\ncomplicated molecules out there you can detect that just from randomly.\" And I was like, \"Really?\" That's a bit like, I don't know, someone saying of course Darwin's textbook was just written randomly by\nsome monkeys and a typewriter. Just for me it was like, really? And I pushed a lot on the chemists now, and I think most of them are on board, but not totally. I really had some big arguments. But the copy number caught there, 'cause I think I confused\nthe chemist by saying, \"one-off,\" and then when I made it clear about the copy number, I think that made it a little bit easier. - Just to clarify, a chemist might say that, of course, out there, outside of earth, there's complex molecules? - Yes.\n- Okay. And then you're saying, \"Wait a minute, that's like saying of course there are aliens out there?\" - [Lee] Yeah, exactly that. - Okay, but you clarify\nthat that's actually a very interesting question and we should be looking\nfor complex molecules of which the copy number\nis two or greater. - Yeah, exactly. So on earth, to coming back to earth, what we did is we took\na whole bunch of samples and we were running prebiotic\nchemistry experiments in the lab. We took various inorganic minerals and extracted them, look at the volatile, because there's a special\nway of treating minerals and polymers in assembly theory. In our life machine,\nwe're looking molecules. We don't care about polymers\nbecause they're not volatile, you can't hold them. If you can't discern\nthat they're identical, then it's very difficult\nfor you to work out if there's undergone selection or they're just a random mess. Same with some minerals, but we can come back to that. So basically, what you do, we got a whole loads of samples. In organic ones, we've got scotch whiskey, and also took a Ardbeg, which is one of my favorite whiskeys, which is very peaty, and another-. - [Lex] What does peaty mean? In Scotland in Islay, which is a island, the whiskey is led to mature in barrels. And it's said that the peat, the complex molecules in the peat, might find their way\nthrough into the whiskey. And that's what gives it\nthis intense brown color and really complex flavor. It's literally molecular\ncomplexity that does that. And so, you know, vulc\nis the complete opposite. It's just pure, right? - [Lex] So the better the whiskey, the higher the assembly index, or the higher assembly index,\nthe better the whiskey. - That's what I mean. I really love the deep,\npeaty Scottish whiskeys. Near my house, there is one of the lowland distilleries\ncalled Glengoyne. It's still beautiful\nwhiskey but not as complex. So for fun, I took some\nGlengoyne whiskey in our bag and put them into the mass spec and measured the assembly index. I also got E. coli. So, the way we do it, take the E. Coli, break the cell apart, take it all apart. And also got some beer. And people were ridiculing us, saying that, \"Oh, beer is\nevidence of complexity.\" One of the computational complexity people who was just throwing- Kind of, he's very vigorous in his disagreement of assembly theory. He was he just saying, you know, \"You don't know what you're doing. Even beer is more complicated than human.\" What he didn't realize is\nthat it's not beer per se, it's taking the yeast\nextract, taking the extract, breaking the cells,\nextracting the molecules, and just looking at the\nprofile of the molecules, see if there's anything\nover the threshold. And we also put in a really\ncomplex molecule, Taxol. So we took all of these, but also NASA gave us, I think, five samples, and they\nwouldn't tell us what they are. They said, \"No, we don't believe you can get this to work.\" And they really, you know, they gave us some super complex samples. And they gave us two fossils. One that was a million years old and one was at 10,000 years old, something from Antarctica's seabed. They gave us some immerses and\nmeteorite and a few others. Put them through the system. So we took all the samples, treated them all identically, put them into mass spec, fragmented them. And in this case, implicit in the measurement was- In mass spec, you only detect peaks when you've got more than, let's say, 10,000 identical molecules. So the copy number's already baked in but wasn't quantified, which is super important there. That was in the first paper, 'cause I was like, \"it's\nabundant, of course.\" And when he then took it all out, we found that the biological samples gave you molecules that had an assembly index greater than 15. And all the abiotic\nsamples were less than 15. And then we took the NASA samples, and we looked at the\nones with more than 15 and less than 15, and we gave them back to NASA. And like, \"Oh gosh. Yep, dead, living, dead, living. You got it.\" And that's what we found on earth. - [Lex] So that's a success? - Yeah, a resounding success. - Well, can you just go back\nto the beer and the E. Coli? So what's the assembly index on those? - So what you were able to do is like, we found high assembly\nindex molecules originating from the beer sample\nand the E. coli sample. - [Lex] So the yeast and the beer. - I mean though, I didn't\nknow which one was higher. We didn't really do any detail there because now we are doing that. Because one of the things we've done, it's a secret, but I\ncan tell you. (laughing) - Nobody's listening. - Well, is that we've just mapped the tree of life using assembly theory, 'cause everyone said that you\ncan't do anything in biology. And what we're able to do is, I think there's two ways\nof doing tree of life- Well, three ways, actually. - Yeah, what's the tree of life? - So the tree of life is\nbasically tracing back the history of life on earth for all the different species going back, who evolved from what, and it all goes all the way back to the first kind of life\nforms, and they branch off. And like, you have plant kingdom, the animal kingdom, the fungi kingdom, you know, and different\nbranches all the way up. And the way this was classically done. And I'm no evolutionary biologist. The evolutionary biologists\ntell me every day, at least 10 times. I want to be one though. I kinda like biology, it's kinda cool. - [Lex] Yeah, it's very cool. It's evolutionary.\n- But basically what Darwin, and Mendel, and all of these people do, it's just they draw pictures, right? And they text though. They were able to draw pictures and say, \"Oh, these look like common classes.\" - Yeah. They're artists, really,\nthey're just, you know? - But they we're able to\nfind out a lot, right, in looking at vibrates and vibrates, Cambrian explosion and all this stuff. And then came the genomic revolution, and suddenly everyone\nused gene sequencing. And Craig Venter is a good example. I think he's gone around\nthe world in his yacht just taking up samples\nlooking for new species, where he's just found new species of life just from sequencing. It's amazing. So you have taxonomy,\nand you have sequencing, and then you can also do a little bit of kind of molecular\nkind of archeology like, you know, measure the samples and kind of form some inference. What we did is we were\nable to fingerprint. We took a load of random\nsamples from all of biology, and we used mass spectrometry. And what we did now is not just look for individual molecules but we looked for coexisting molecules where they had to look at\ntheir joint assembly space, where we were able to cut them apart and undergo recursion in the mass spec and infer some relationships. And we were able to recapitulate the tree of life using mass spectroscopy, no sequencing and no drawing. - All right, can you try to say that again with a little more detail? So, recreating. What does it take to\nrecreate the tree of life? What does the reverse engineering\nprocess look like here? - So what you do is you\ntake an unknown sample, you bung it into the mass spec. 'Cause this comes from what you're asking, like, what do you see in E. coli? And so in E. Coli, it's not that the most sophisticated cells on earth make the most\nsophisticated molecules. It is the coexistence of lots of complex molecules above a threshold. And so what we realize\nis you could fingerprint different life forms. So fungi make really\ncomplicated molecules. Why? 'Cause they can't move. They have to make everything on site. Whereas, you know, some\nanimals are like lazy. They can just go eat the fungi and they don't need to make very much. And so what you do is, so you take, I don't\nknow, the fingerprint, maybe the top number of high\nmolecular weight molecules you find in the sample, you fragment them to get\ntheir assembly indices, and then what you can do is you can infer common origins of molecules. When the reverse engineering\nof the assembly space, you can infer common roots and look at what's called\nthe joint assembly space. But let's translate that\ninto the experiment. Take a sample, bung it in the mass spec, take the top say 10\nmolecules, fragment them, and that gives you one fingerprint. Then you do it for another sample, you get another fingerprint. Now the question is you say, hey, are these samples\nthe same or different? And that's what we've been able to do. And by basically looking\nat the assembly space that these molecules create. Without any knowledge of assembly theory, you are unable to do it. With the knowledge of assembly theory, you can reconstruct the tree. - How does knowing if\nthey're the same or different give you the tree? - Let's go to two leaves on different branches on the tree, right? What you can do, by counting\nthe number of differences, you can estimate how far\naway their origin was. - Got it.\n- And that's all we do. And it just works. But when we realized you\ncould even use assembly theory to recapitulate the tree of\nlife with no gene sequencing, we were like, \"huh.\" - So this is looking at samples that exist today in the world. What about like things\nthat no longer exist? I mean, the tree contains\ninformation about the past. Some of it is gone. - Yeah, absolutely. I would love to get old fossil samples and apply assembly theory mass spec and see if we can find new forms of life. They are no longer\namenable to gene sequencing 'cause the DNA is all gone. 'Cause DNA and RNA is quite unstable, but some of them are complex molecules. It might be there, it\nmight give you a hint of something new. Or, wouldn't it be great\nif you find a sample that's worth really persevering and doing, you know, doing the proper extraction to, you know, PCR and so on, and then sequence it, and then put it together. - So when a thing dies, you can still get some\ninformation about its complexity. - Yeah. And it appears that\nyou can do some dating. Now, there are really good techniques. There's radiocarbon dating. There is longer dating, going and looking at\nradioactive minerals and so on. And you can also, in bone, you can look at the- What happens after something dies, you get what's called racemization, where the chirality in the\npolymers basically changes and you get decomposition. And the rate of the deviation\nfrom the pure enantiomer to the mixture, it gives you\na timescale on it, half-life, so you can date when it died. I wanna use assembly theory\nto see if I can use it and date death and things, and trace the tree of life, and also decomposition of molecules. - [Lex] Do you think it's possible? - Oh yeah. Without a doubt. It may not be better. 'Cause like, I was just at a conference where some brilliant people were looking at isotope enrichment and looking at how life enriches isotopes, and there are really sophisticated\nstuff that they're doing. But I think there's some\nfun to be had there, because it gives you another dimension of dating how old is this\nmolecule in terms of- Or, more importantly, how long ago was this\nmolecule produced by life? The more complex the molecule, the more prospect for decomposition, oxidation, reorganization,\nloss of chirality and all that jazz. But what life also does is it enriches, as you get older, the\nthe amount of carbon 13 in you goes up because\nof the way the bonding is in carbon 13. So it has a slightly different\nbond strength than you, it's called the kinetic isotope effect. So you can literally date\nhow old you are, you know, or when you stop metabolizing. So you could date someone\nhow old they are, I think. I'm making this up, this might be right, but I think it's roughly right. The amount of carbon 13 you have in you, you can kind of estimate how old you are. - How old living humans\nare or living organisms? - Yeah, like you could say, oh, this person is 10 years old, and this person 30 years old because they've been\nmetabolizing more carbon, and they've accumulated it. That's the basic idea. It's probably a completely\nwrong timescale but- - Signatures of chemistry are fascinating. So you've been saying a\nlot of chemistry examples for assembly theory. What if we zoom out and look\nat a bigger scale of an object, you know, like really complex objects, like humans or living organisms that are made up of, you know, millions or billions of other organisms? How do you try to apply\nassembly theory to that? - At the moment, we should be able to do\nthis to morphology in cells. So we're looking at cell surfaces. And really, I'm trying to extend further. It's just that, you know, we work so hard to get this paper out and people to start discussing the ideas. But it's kinda funny, because I think the\npenny is falling on this. - What's it mean for\na penny to be falling? - I mean, the penny's dropped, right? 'Cause a lotta people were like, \"it's rubbish, it's rubbish. You've insulted me. It's wrong.\" And, you know, I mean\nthe paper got published on the 4th of October. It had 2.3 million\nengagements on Twitter, right? And it's been downloaded over\na few hundred thousand times. And someone actually said to me, wrote to me and said, \"This is an example of\nreally bad writing,\" and what not to do. And I was like, if all of my papers got read this much, 'cause that's the objective. If I have a publishing, a paper, I want people to read it. I wanna write that badly again. - Yeah. I don't know what's the deep insight here about the negativity in the space. I think it's probably the immune system of the scientific community making sure that there's no bullshit\nthat gets published. And that it can overfire, it can do a lot of damage, it can shut down conversations in a way that's not productive. - I mean, I'll answer your question about the hierarchy in assembly, but let's go back to the perception, people saying the paper was badly written. I mean, of course we could improve it. We could always improve the clarity. - Let's go there before\nwe go to the hierarchy. You know, it has been criticized\nquite a bit, the paper. What has been some criticism\nthat you found most powerful, like, that you can understand\nand can you explain it? - Yes. The most exciting criticism came from the evolutionary biologist, telling me that they thought that origin of life was a solved problem. And I was like, whoa,\nwe're really onto something because it's clearly not. And then when you poked them on that, they just said, \"No, you\ndon't understand evolution.\" And I said, \"No, no, I don't think you\nunderstand that evolution had to occur before\nbiology and there's a gap.\" For me, that misunderstanding, and that did cause an immune response which was really interesting. The second thing was the\nfact that physicists- Well, the physicists were\nactually really polite, right? And really nice about it. But they just said, \"Huh, we're not really sure about the initial conditions thing.\" But this is a really big debate that we should certainly get into because you know the emergence of life was not encoded in the initial\nconditions of the universe. And I think assembly theory\nshows why it can't be. - Okay, sure. If you could say that again. - The the emergence of life was not and cannot in principle be encoded in the initial\nconditions of the universe. - Just to clarify what you\nmean by life is like what? High assembly index objects? - Yeah. And this goes back to\nyour favorite subject. - What's that?\n- Time. (both chuckling) - Right, so why? What does time have to do with it? - I mean, probably we\ncan come back to it later if we have time. I think I now understand\nhow to explain how- You know, lots of people got angry with the assembly paper, but also the ramifications of this is how time is fundamental in the universe and this notion of combinatorial spaces. And there are so many layers on this, but I think you have to become\nan intuitionist mathematician and you have to abandon\nplatonic mathematics. And also, platonic mathematics\nhas left physics astray. But there's a lot unpack there. So we can go to the- - Platonic mathematics. Okay. The evolutionary biologists criticize it because the origin of life is understood and it doesn't require an explanation that involves physics. - Yeah.\n- That's their statement. - Well, I mean, they said\nlots of confusing statements. Basically, I realized the\nevolutionary biology community that were vocal, and some\nof them were really rude, really spiteful and needlessly so, right? Because look, you know, people misunderstand publication as well. Some of the people has said, \"How dare this be published in nature? This is, you know, what\na terrible journal.\" And I said to people, \"Look, this is this is a brand new idea that's not only\npotentially going to change the way we look at biology, it's gonna change the way\nwe look at the universe.\" And everyone's, like, saying, \"How dare you? How dare you be so grandiose?\" I'm like, \"No, no, no, this is not hype.\" We're not like saying we've invented some, I don't know, we've discovered a alien in a closet somewhere just for hype. We genuinely mean this to\ngenuinely have the impact or ask the question. And the way people jumped on that was a really bad\nprecedent for young people who wanna actually do something new because this makes a bold claim. And the chances are that it's not correct. But what I wanted to do\nis a couple of things. Is I wanted to make a bold claim that was precise and\ntestable and correctable. Not another wooly information\nin biology argument, information Turing machine,\nblah, blah, blah, blah, blah. A concrete series of statements that can be falsified and explored, and either the theory could\nbe destroyed or built upon. - Well, what about the criticism of you're just putting\na bunch of sexy names on something that's already obvious? - Yeah, that's really good. So the assembly index of\na molecule is not obvious. No one had measure it before. And no one has thought to\nquantify selection complexity and copy number before in such\na primitive quantifiable way. I think the nice thing about this paper, this paper is a tribute to all the people that understand that biology does something very interesting. Some people call it negentropy, some people call it, think about, you know, organizational principles. Lots of people were not\nshocked by the paper because they'd done it before. A lot of the arguments we got, some people said, \"Oh, it's rubbish. Oh, by the way, I had this\nidea 20 years before.\" I was like, \"Which one?\" The rubbish part or the\nreally revolutionary part? So this kind of plucks\ntwo strings at once. It plucked the there is\nsomething interesting the biologies are, as\nwe can see around us, but we haven't quantified yet. And what this is, is the first\nstab at quantifying that. So the fact that people\nsaid this is obvious but it's also- So if it's obvious, why\nhave you not done it? - Sure, but there's a\nfew things to say there. One is, you know, this is in part a philosophical framework\nbecause, you know, it's not like you can apply this generally to any object in the universe. It's very chemistry focused. - Yeah, well, I think you will be able to, we just haven't got there robustly. So if we can say how can we- Let's go up a level. So if we go up from a level, let's go up from molecules to cells, 'cause you would jump to people and I jump to emoticons, and both were good and\nthey will be assembly. - [Lex] Yeah, let's stick with cells. Yeah, good point. - So if we go from\nmolecules to assemblies, and let's take a cellular assembly. A nice thing about a cell is you can tell the\ndifference between a eukaryote and a prokaryote, right? The organelle are specialized differently. We then look at the cell surface, and the cell surface has\ndifferent glycosylation patterns and these cells will stick together. Now let's go up a level. In multicellular creatures, you have cellular differentiation. Now if you think about\nhow embryos develop, you go all the way back, those cells undergo differentiation on a causal way that's biomechanically a feedback between the\ngenetics and biomechanics. I think we can use assembly theory to apply to tissue types. We can even apply it to\ndifferent cell disease types. So that's what we're doing next, but we are trying to walk. You know, the thing is, I wanna leap ahead to go, well, we'll apply it to culture. But clearly, you can apply\nit to memes and culture. And we've also applied assembly theory to CAs, and not as you think. - [Lex] Cellular automata, by the way. - Yeah, yeah, to cellular automaton, not just as you think. Different CA rules were\ninvented by different people at different times. And one of my coworkers, a very talented chap, basically was like, \"Oh, I can realize that different people had different ideas with different rules, and they copied each other and made slightly different\ncellular automaton rules, and they looked at them online.\" And so he was able to\naffirm an assembly index and copy number of rule\nwhatever doing this thing. But I digress. But it does show you can\napply it at a higher scale. So what do we need to do to\napply assembly theory to things? We need to agree there's a\ncommon set of building blocks. Well, in a multicellular creature, you need to look back in time. So there is the initial cell, which a creature is fertilized\nand then starts to grow, and then there is cell differentiation. And you have to then make that\ncausal chain both on those. So that requires development\nof the organism in time. Or if you look at the cell\nsurfaces and the cell types, they've got different features on the cell walls and inside the cell. So we're building up. But obviously, I wanna leap\nto things like emoticons, language, mathematical theorems. - Yeah, but that's a very\nlarge number of steps to get from a molecule to the human brain. - Yeah, and I think they are related but in hierarchies of emergence, right? So you shouldn't compare them. I mean, the assembly\nindex of a human brain, what does that even mean? Well, maybe we can look at the morphology of the human brain. Say all human brains have these number of features in common. And then let's look at a brain in a whale or a dolphin or a chimpanzee\nor a bird and say, okay, let's look at the\nassembly indices number of features in these. And now the copy number is just a number of how many birds are there, how many chimpanzees are there, how many humans are there? - But then you have to discover for the features that\nyou would be looking for. - Yeah, and that means\nyou need to have some idea of the anatomy. - But there's an automated\nway to discover features? - I guess so. I mean, and I think this is a good way to apply machine learning\nand image recognition just to basically characterize things. - To apply compression\nto it to see what emerges and then use the thing. The features used as\npart of the compression as the thing that is searched for when you're measuring assembly\nindex and copy number. - And the compression has to be remember the assembly universe, which is you have to go\nfrom assembly possible to assembly contingent. 'Cause assembly possible\nor possible brains or possible features all the time. But we know that on the tree of life, and also on the lineage of\nlife, going back to LUCA, the human brain just didn't\nspring into existence yesterday, it is a long lineage of\nbrains going all the way back. And so, if we could do assembly theory to understand the development, not just in evolutionary history but in biological development as you grow, we are gonna learn something more. - What would be amazing is if\nyou can use assembly theory, this framework, to show the increase in the assembly index associated with, I don't know, cultures or pieces of text like language or images and so on, and illustrate without knowing\nthe data ahead of time, just kinda like you did with NASA, that you were able to demonstrate that it applies in those other contexts. I mean, and that, you know,\nprobably wouldn't at first and you have to evolve the theory somehow. You have to change it, you\nhave to expand it, you know? - [Lee] I think so. - But like that. I guess this is, as a paper, a first step in saying, okay, can we create a general framework for measuring complexity of\nobjects, for measuring life, the complexity of living organisms. - [Lee] Yeah. - That's what this is reaching for. - That is the first step. And also to say, look, we have a way of quantifying selection and evolution in a fairly, not mundane, but a fairly mechanical way. Because before now, you know, the ground truth for\nit was very subjective. Whereas here, we're talking\nabout clean observables. And there's gonna be layers on that. I mean, with collaborators right now, we already think we can do\nassembly theory on language. And not only that. Wouldn't it be great if we can figure out how under pressure\nlanguage is gonna evolve and be more efficient, 'cause you're gonna wanna transmit things. And again, it's not\njust about compression, it is about understanding how you can make the most of the architecture\nyou've already built. And I think this is something beautiful that evolution does. We're reusing those architectures. We can't just abandon\nour evolutionary history. And if you don't wanna abandon\nyour evolutionary history, and you know that evolution\nhas been happening, then assembly theory works. And I think that's the\nkey comment I wanna make, is that assembly theory\nis great for understanding when evolution has been used. The next jump is when we go to technology. 'Cause of course, if you\ntake the M3 processor. I haven't bought one yet, I can't justify it, but\nI want to at some point. The M3 processor arguably, there's quite a lot of features and quite large number. The M2 came before it, then the M1, all the way back. You can apply assembly theory to microprocessor architecture. It doesn't take a huge leap to see that. - I'm a Linux guy, by the way, so your examples go away over my head. - [Lee] Yeah, well, whatever. - Is that a fruit company of some sort? I don't even know. Yeah, there's a lotta interesting stuff to ask about language. Like you could look at- How would that work? You could look at GPT-1,\nGPT-2, GPT-3, 3.5, 4 and try to analyze the kind\nof language it produces. I mean, that's almost trying\nto look at assembly index of intelligent systems. - Yeah, I mean, I think the thing about large language models, and this is a whole hobby\nhorse I have at the moment, is that obviously they're all about- The evidence of evolution\nin the large language model comes from all the people that\nproduced all the language. And that's really interesting. And all the corrections in\nthe Mechanical Turk, right? - [Lex] Sure. - And so-\n- But that's the part of the history, part of\nthe memory of the system. - Exactly. So it would be really\ninteresting to basically use an assembly-based approach\nto making language in a hierarchy, right? My guess is that we might\nbe able to build a new type of large language model\nthat uses assembly theory that it has more understanding of the past and how things were created. Where basically, with a thing with LLMs is they're like everything\neverywhere all at once, splat, and make the user happy. So there's not much\nintelligence in the model. The model is how the human\ninteracts with the model. But wouldn't it be great\nif we could understand how to embed more\nintelligence in the system? - What do you mean by intelligence there? Like you seem to associate intelligence with history and memory. - I think selection produces intelligence. - Wait, what? You're almost implying that\nselection is intelligence. No.\n- Yeah, kind of. I would go out and limb and say that. But I think it's a little bit more. Human beings have the ability to abstract and they can break beyond selection. Darwinian selection. Because a human being\ndoesn't have to basically do trial and error. Like they can think about it and say, oh, that's a\nbad idea, won't do that. And then technologies and so on. - So we escaped Darwinian evolution and now we're onto some other\nkind of evolution I guess? - Yeah.\n- Higher level evolution. - And the assembly theory will\nmeasure that as well, right? Because it's all a lineage. - Okay, another piece of criticism, or by way of question is, how's assembly theory\nor maybe assembly index different from Kolmogorov complexity? So for people who don't know, a Kolmogorov complexity of an object is the length of a\nshortest computer program that produces the object as output. - Yeah, there seems to be a disconnect between the computational\napproach, so yeah. So a Kolmogorov measure requires a Turing machine, requires a computer. And that's one thing. And the other thing is assembly theory is supposed to trace the process by which life evolution emerged, right? There's a main thing there. There are lots of other layers. So Kolmogorov complexity, you can you can approximate\nKolmogorov complexity but it's not really telling you very much about the actual- It's really telling you about like, your compression of your dataset. And so, that doesn't really\nhelp you identify the turtle, in this case is the computer. And so what assembly theory does is, I'm gonna say, (chuckles) there's a trigger warning\nfor anyone listening who loves complexity theory. I think that we're gonna show that AIT is a very important\nsubset of assembly theory, because here's what happens. I think that assembly theory allows us to understand when were\nselections occurring, selection produces factories and things, factories in the end produce computers, then algorithmic information\ntheory comes out of that. The frustration I've\nhad with looking at life through this kind of information theory is it doesn't take into account causation. So the main difference\nbetween assembly theory and all these complexity measures is there's no causal chain. And I think that's the main- - That's the causal chains at\nthe core of assembly theory. - Exactly. And if you've got all your\ndata in a computer memory, all the data's the same. You can access it in the same type of way, you don't care, you just compress it, and you either look at the program runtime or the shortest program. And that for me is\nabsolutely not capturing what its selection does. - But Assembly theory looks at objects, it doesn't have information\nabout the object history. It's going to try to infer that history by looking for the\nshortest history, right? The object doesn't like\nhave a Wikipedia page that goes with it about its history. - I would I would say it does in a way, and it is fascinating to look at. So you've just got the object and you have no other\ninformation about the object. What assembly theory allows you to do just with the object is to- And the word infer is\ncorrect, I agree with infer. So it's, you know, like say\nwell that's not the history, but something really\ninteresting comes from this. The shortest path is\ninferred from the object. That is the worst case\nscenario if you have no machine to make it. So that tells you about the\ndepth of that object in time. And so, what assembly\ntheory allows you to do is, without considering any\nother circumstances, to say from this object how\ndeep is this object in time if we just treat the object as itself without any other constraints. And that's super powerful because the shortest path then allows you to say, oh, this object\nwasn't just created randomly, there was a process. And so, assembly theory\nis not meant to, you know, one up AIT or to ignore the factory. It's just to say, hey,\nthere was a factory, and how big was that factory\nand how deep in time is it? - But it's still\ncomputationally very difficult to compute that history, right? For complex objects. - It is. It becomes harder. But one of the things that's super nice is that it constrains your\ninitial conditions, right? It constrains where you're gonna be. So one of the things we're doing right now is applying assembly\ntheory to drug discovery. Now what everyone's doing right now is taking all the proteins\nand looking at the proteins and looking at molecules not the proteins. Why not instead look at the molecules that are involved in interacting with the receptors over time, rather thinking about and use\nthe molecules evolve over time as a proxy for how the\nproteins evolved over time., and then use that to constrain\nyour drug discovery process. You flip the problem 180 and focus on the molecule evolution\nrather than the protein. And so you can guess in the\nfuture what might happen. So you rather than having to consider all possible molecules, you know where to focus. And that's the same\nthing if you're looking in assembly spaces for an object where you don't know the entire history but you know in the history of this object it's not gonna have some other motif there that doesn't appear in the past. - But just even for the drug\ndiscovery point you made, don't you have to\nsimulate all of chemistry to figure out how to\ncome up with constraints through the molecules and- - No.\n- I don't I don't know enough about producing. - This is another thing\nthat I think causes- 'Cause this paper goes\nacross so many boundaries. So chemists have looked at this and said this is not correct reaction. It's like, no, it's a graph. (laughing) - Sure, there's a assembly index and shortest path examples\nhere on chemistry. - Yeah. And what you do is you look\nat the minimal constraints on that graph. Of course it has some\nmapping to the synthesis, but actually you don't have\nto know all of chemistry, you can build up the\nconstraints space rather nicely. But this is just at the beginning, right? There are so many\ndirections this could go. And I said, it could all be wrong but hopefully it's less wrong. - What about the little\ncriticism I saw of do you- By way of question, do you consider the\ndifferent probabilities of each reaction in the chain? So like, that there could be different- When you look at a chain of events that led up to the creation of an object, doesn't it matter that\nsome parts in the chain are less likely than others? - No - It doesn't matter.\n- No, no. Well, let's go back. So, no not less likely, but it reacts so- So, no. So let's go back to what\nwe're looking at here. So the assembly index is the minimal path that could have created that\nobject probabilistically. So imagine you have all\nyour atoms in the plasma, you got enough energy, there's collisions. What is the quickest way you\ncould zip out that molecule with no reaction constraints? - How do you define quickest there then? - It's just basically a\nwalk on a random graph. So we make an assumption that basically the timescale for forming the bonds. So, no, I don't wanna say that because then it's gonna have\npeople getting obsessing about this point, and your\ncriticism is a really good one. What we're trying to say is like this puts a lower bound on something. Of course, some reactions are\nless possible than others. But actually, I don't think\nchemical reactions exist. - Oh, boy. What does that mean? Why don't chemical reactions exist? - I'm writing a paper right now that I keep being told I have to finish, and it's called \"The Origin\nof Chemical Reactions\". And it merely says that reactivity exists, as controlled by the laws\nof quantum mechanics, and reactions, chemists\nput names on reactions, you could have like, I don't know, the Wittig reaction, which\nis by, you know, Wittig. You could have the Suzuki\nreaction which is by Suzuki. Now what are these reactions? So these reactions are\nconstrained by the following. They're constrained by the fact they're on planet earth, 1G,\n298 kelvin, and one bar. So these are constraints. They're also constrained by the chemical composition of earth. Oxygen, availability, all this stuff. And that then allows us\nto focus on our chemistry. So when a chemist does a reaction, that's a really nice compressed shorthand for constraint application. Glass flask, pure reagent, temperature pressure,\nboom, boom, boom, boom, control, control,\ncontrol, control, control. So of course, we have bond energies. So the bond energies are kind\nof intrinsic in a vacuum. So the bond energy. You have to have a bond. And so, for assembly theory to work, you have to have a bond, which means that bond\nhas to give the molecule a certain half-life. So you're probably gonna find later on that some bonds are weaker. When you look at the\nassembly of some molecules, you're gonna miscount the\nassembly of the molecule 'cause it falls apart too quickly, 'cause the bonds just form. But you can solve that\nwith looking at infrared. So when people think\nabout the probability, they're kinda misunderstanding. Assembly theory says\nnothing about the chemistry because chemistry is chemistry and their constraints\nare put in by biology. There was no chemist\nat the origin of life, unless you believe in\nthe chemist in the sky and they were, you know,\nit's like Santa Claus, they had a lot of work to do. But chemical reactions do not exist, the constraints that allow\nchemical transformations to occur do exist. - Okay, okay. So there's no chemical reactions, it's all constraint application which enables the emergence of- What's a different word\nfor chemical reaction? - Transformation.\n- Transformation. - [Lee] Yeah, like a function. It's a function.\n- Yeah. But no, but I love chemical\nreactions as a shorthand and so the chemists don't all go mad. I mean, of course chemical\nreactions exist on earth. - It's a shorthand\n- It's a shorthand for these constraints. - Right. So assuming all these\nconstraints that we've been using for so long that we just assume\nthat that's always the case, in natural language conversation. - Exactly. The grammar of chemistry of\ncourse emerges in reactions and we can use 'em reliably. But I do not think the Wittig reaction is accessible on Venus. - Right, and this is useful\nto remember, you know, to frame it as constraint\napplication is useful for when you zoom out\nto the bigger picture of the universe and\nlooking at the chemistry of the universe and then starting\nto apply assembly theory. - Yeah.\n- That's interesting. That's really interesting. (chuckles) Well, we've also\npissed off the chemist now. - Oh, I expect they're pretty happy, well most of them. (laughing) - Everybody deep down is happy, I think. They're just sometimes feisty, that's how they have fun. - Everyone is grumpy on some days when- The problem with this paper is you- I used to do this\noccasionally when I was young. Go to a meeting and just\nfind a way to offend everyone at the meeting simultaneously. Even the factions that\ndon't like each other, they're all unified in their hatred of you just offending them. This paper, it feels\nlike the person that went to the party and offended\neveryone simultaneously, so they stop fighting with themselves and just focused on this paper. - Maybe just a little insider\ninteresting information. What were the editors of \"Nature\", their reviews and so on, how difficult was that process? 'Cause this is a pretty, like, big paper. - When we originally sent the paper, we sent the paper, and the\neditor said that, you know- This was quite a long process. We sent the paper, and the\neditor gave us some feedback and said, \"You know, I don't think it's that interesting.\" Or, \"It's a hard concept.\" And the editor gave us some feedback, and Sara and I took a\nyear to rewrite the paper. - Was the nature of the\nfeedback very specific on like, this part or this part, or was it, like, what\nare you guys smoking? - Yeah, it was kind of the latter. What you smoking?\n- Okay. (Lee laughing) - But polite and there's promise. - Yeah, well, the thing is, the editor was really critical, but in a really professional way. And I mean, for me, this was\nthe way science should happen. So when it came back, you know, we had too many equations in the paper. If you look at the preprint, they're just equations everywhere, like there are 23 equations. And when I said to Abhishek, who was the first author, and we've gotta remove all the equations, but my assembly equation's staying. And Abhishek was like,\n\"You know, no, we can't.\" I said, \"Well, look, if we\nwant to explain this to people, there's a real challenge.\" And so Sara and I went through the, I think it was actually\n160 versions of the paper, but basically we got to\nversion 40 or something. We said, \"Right, zero, let's start again.\" So we wrote the whole paper again. We knew the entire archive.\n- Amazing. - And we just went bit\nby bit by bit and said, \"What is it we wanna say?\" And then we sent the paper in, and we expected it to be rejected and not even go to review. And then we got the notification back, it had gone to review, and we were like, \"Oh my God,\nit's so gonna get rejected. How's it gonna get rejected?\" 'Cause the first assembly paper on the mass spec we sent to \"Nature\" went through six rounds of\nreview and were rejected, right? And this by a chemist who just said, \"I don't believe you, you\nmust be committing fraud.\" And long story, probably a boring story. But in this case, it went out to review, the comments came back, and the comments were incredibly- No, they were very deep comments from all the reviewers. But the nice thing was\nthe reviewers were kind of very critical but not dismissive. They were like, \"Oh, really? Explain this. Explain this. Explain this. Explain this.\"\n- That's great. - \"Are you sure it's not Kolmogorov? Are you sure it's not this?\" And we went through, I think, three rounds of review pretty quick. And the editor went, \"Yeah, it's in.\" - But maybe you could just\ncomment on the whole process. You've published some pretty huge papers on all kinds of topics\nwithin chemistry and beyond. Some of them have some\nlittle spice in them, a little spice of crazy. Like Tom Waits says, \"I like my town with a\nlittle drop of poison.\" So, you know, it's not a mundane paper. So what's it like psychologically to go through all this process\nto keep getting rejected to get reviews from people\nthat don't get the paper or all that kind of stuff? Just from a question of a scientist, what is that like? - I mean, this paper, for me, kind of- 'Cause this wasn't the first time we tried to publish assembly theory\nat the highest level, the \"Nature\" communications\npaper on the mass spec on the idea went to\n\"Nature\" and got rejected. Look, it went through six rounds of review and got rejected. And I just was so confused\nwhen the chemist said, \"This can't be possible, I do not believe you\ncan measure complexity using mass spec. And also, by the way, complex molecules can randomly form.\" And we're like, \"But look at the data. The data says.\" And they said, \"No, no,\nwe don't believe you.\" I just wouldn't give up. (laughing) And the editor, in the end, different editors actually, right? - What's behind that never giving up? When you're sitting there\n10 o'clock in the evening, there's a melancholy\nfeeling that comes over you, and you're like, \"Okay, this\nis rejection number five.\" Or it's not rejection but\nmaybe it feels like a rejection because of the, you know, the comments are that you totally don't get it. Like what gives you strength\nto keep going there? - I don't know. I don't normally get\nemotional about papers. It's not about giving up because we wanna get it published, 'cause we\nwant the glory or anything. It's just like, why don't you understand? So why I would just try to\nbe as rational as possible and say, \"Yeah you didn't like it, tell me why?\" And then- Sorry. Silly.\n- And you part- - I never get emotional\nabout papers normally, but I think what we do is\nyou just compressed, like, five years of angst from this. - So it's been rough? - It's not just rough,\nit's like it happened. You know, I came up with\nthe assembly equation, you know, remote from Sara in Arizona and the people at SFI, I felt like I was a mad person, like, you know, the guy\ndepicted in \"A Beautiful Mind\". Not the actual genius part, but just the, gibberish, gibberish,\ngibberish. (laughing) Because I kept writing expanded. And I have no mathematical ability at all, and I was making these\nmathematical expansions where I kept seeing the same motif again. I was like, \"Oh, I think\nthis is a copy number.\" The same string is coming\nagain, again, again. I couldn't do the math. And then I realized the copy\nnumber fell outta the equation and everything collapsed down. I was like, \"Oh, that works, kind of.\" So we submitted the paper, and then when it was\nalmost accepted, right? The mass spec one. And there was astrobiologists,\nsaid, \"Great.\" you know, a mass\nspectroscopist said, \"Great,\" and the chemist went, \"Nonsense.\" Like, \"Biggest pile of nonsense\never, fraud,\" you know? And I was like, \"But why fraud?\" And they just said, \"Just because.\" And I was like, \"Well.\" And I could not convince\nthe editor in this case. The editor was just so off, 'cause they see it as like a kind of a, you know, you're wasting my time. And I would not give up. I wrote. I went and dissected,\nyou know, all the parts. And I think although, I mean, I got upset about it, you know, it was kind of embarrassing\nactually, but I guess- - [Lex] (speaks faintly) beautiful. - But it was just trying to understand why they didn't like it. So a part of me was\nlike really devastated. And a part of me was super excited, 'cause I'm like, \"Huh, they\ncan't tell me why I'm wrong.\" And this kinda goes back to, you know- When I was at school, I was in a kinda learning\ndifficulties class and I kept going to the teacher and say, you know, \"What do I\ndo today to prove I'm smart?\" And they were like, \"Nothing, you can't.\" I was like, \"Gimme a job,\" you know, \"gimme something to do. Gimme a job to do. Something just to do as we-\" And I kinda felt like that a bit when I was arguing with the- And not arguing, there\nwas no (indistinct), and I wasn't telling the\neditor they were idiots or anything like this, or the reviewers, I kept it strictly, like, factual. And all I did is I just\nkept knocking it down bit by bit by bit by bit by bit. It was ultimately rejected, and it got published though, elsewhere. And then, the actual experimental data. In this paper, the\nexperimental justification was already published. So when we did this one and\nwe went through the versions and then we sent it in, and in the end it just got accepted. We were like, \"Well,\nthat's kinda cool, right?\" The first author was like, \"I can't believe it got accepted.\" Like, nor am I, but it's great. It's like, it's good. And then when the paper was published, I was not expecting the backlash. I was expecting computational- Well, no actually, I was\njust expecting one person who'd been trolling me\nfor a while about it just to carry on trolling. But I didn't expect the backlash. And then, I wrote to the\neditor and apologized. And the editor was like,\n\"What are you apologizing for? It was a great paper. Of course it's gonna get backlash, you said some controversial\nstuff, but it's awesome.\" - Well, I think it's a\nbeautiful story of perseverance, and the backlash is just a\nnegative word for discourse, which I think is beautiful. That's the science. - You know, when it got accepted and people were saying we're\nkind of like hacking on it. I was like, \"Papers are not gold medals.\" The reason I wanted to publish that paper in \"Nature\" is because it says, \"Hey, there's something\nbefore biological evolution.\" You have to have that if you're not a creationist, by the way. This is an approach. First time someone has\nput a concrete mechanism, sorry, a concrete quantification. And what comes next, you're\npushing on, is a mechanism. And that's what we need to get to is an autocatalytic set,\nself-replicating molecules, some other features that come in. And the fact that this\npaper has been so discussed, for me, is a dream come true. Like, it doesn't get better than that. If you can't accept a\nfew people hating it. And the nice thing is, the thing that really makes me happy is that no one has attacked\nthe actual physical content. Like, you can measure the assembly index, you can measure selection now. Well, either that's helpful or unhelpful. If it's unhelpful, this\npaper will sink down and no one will use it again. If it's helpful, it'll help\npeople build a scaffold on it, and we'll start to\nconverge to a new paradigm. So I think that that's the\nthing that I wanted to see, you know, my colleagues,\nauthors, collaborators, and people were like, \"You've just published this\npaper, you're a chemist. Why have you done this? Like, who are you to be\ndoing evolutionary theory?\" Like, well, \"I dunno. I mean, sorry, did I need to-\" - Cause anyone to do anything. Well, I'm glad you did. Before coming back to origin of life and these kinds of questions, you mentioned learning difficulties. I didn't know about this. So what was it like? - I wasn't very good at school, right? - [Lex] This is when you were very young? - Yeah, yeah, in primary school. My handwriting was really poor, and apparently I couldn't read, and my mathematics was very poor. So they just said this is a problem, they identified it. My parents kind of at\nthe time were confused because I was busy taking things apart, buying electronic junk from the shop, trying to build computers and things. And then, when I was I think about- The major transition in my stupidity, like, you know, everyone thought I wasn't that stupid when I- Basically, everyone thought I was faking. I like stuff and I was\nfaking wanting to be- So I always wanted to be a scientist. So five, six, seven years old, be a scientist, take things apart. And everyone's like, \"Yeah, this guy wants to be a scientist, but he's an idiot.\" (laughing) So everyone was really confused, I think, at first, that I wasn't\nsmarter than I, you know, was claiming to be. And then I just basically didn't do well in any of the tests and I went down and\ndown and down and down. And I was kinda like, \"Huh, this is really embarrassing.\" I really like maths and\neveryone says I can't do it. I really like kind of, you know, physics and chemistry and science, and people say you can't read and write. And so, I found myself in a\nlearning difficulties class at the end of primary school and the beginning of secondary school. In the UK, secondary school\nis like 11, 12 years old. And I remember being put\nin the remedial class. And the remedial class\nwas basically full of, well, three types of people. There were people that had quite violent, right, you know?\n- Yeah. - And there were people\nwho couldn't speak English. And there were people that\nreally had learning difficulties. The one thing I can\nobjectively remember was- I mean, I could read. I like reading. I read a lot. I'm a bit of a rebel. I refused to read what I was told to read. And I found it difficult\nto read individual words in the way they were told. But anyway, so I got\ncaught one day teaching someone else to read. And they said, \"Okay, we\ndon't understand this.\" I always knew I wanted to be a scientist, but didn't really know what that meant. And I realized you had\nto go to university. And I thought I can just go to university, it's like curious people. Like, no, no, no, you need to have these, you have to be able to\nenter in these exams to get this grade point average. And the fact is the exams\nyou've been entered into, you're just gonna get C, D, or E. You can't even get A, B, or C, right? This is the UK GCSEs. I was like, \"Oh, shit.\" And I said, \"Can you just\nput me into the high exams?\" They said, \"No, no, you're gonna fail. There's no chance.\" So my father kind of intervened and said, you know, \"Just let him go in the exams.\" And they said, \"He's\ndefinitely gonna fail, it's a waste of time, waste of money.\" And he said, \"Well, what if we paid?\" So they said, \"Well, okay.\" So he didn't actually have to pay. He only had to pay if I failed. So I took the exams and\npassed them, fortunately. I didn't get the top grades but I, you know, I got into A levels. But then that also kind of limited what I could do at A levels. I wasn't allowed to do A-Level maths. - What do you mean you weren't allowed to? - Because I had such a bad\nmath grade from my GCSEs, I only had a C. But they wouldn't let me\ngo into the ABC for maths 'cause of some kind of\ncoursework requirement back then. The top grade I coulda got was a C. So C, D, or E. So I got a C. And they let me do kind of AS-level maths, which is this half intermediate, but I didn't get go university. But in the end I liked chemistry, I had a good chemistry teacher. So in the end, I got to\nuniversity to do chemistry. - So through that kind\nof process, I think, for kids in that situation, it's easy to start\nbelieving that you're not, well, how do I put it? That you're stupid, and basically give up. That you're just not good at math, you're not good at school. So this is by way of advice for people, for interesting people, for interesting young kids right now, experiencing the same thing. What was the source of\nyou not giving up there? - I have no idea other than I really liked not understanding stuff. For me, when I not understand something- (chuckles) I feel like I\ndon't understand anything now. But back then, I remember\nwhen I was like, I don't know. I tried to build a laser\nwhen I was, like, eight. And I thought, how hard could it be? And basically I was\ngonna build a CO2 laser. I was like, \"Right, I think I need some partially coated mirrors, I need some carbon dioxide, and I need a high voltage. And I was so stupid, right? I was kind of so embarrassed. I had to make enough CO2. I actually set a fire and\ntried to filter the flame- - Oh, nice.\n- To trap enough CO2. And I was like, it completely failed and I burnt half the the garage down. So my parents were not\nvery happy about that. So that was one thing. I was like, I really like\nfirst principle thinking, and so, you know? So I remember being super curious and being determined to find answers. And so, when people do\ngive advice about this, why I ask for advice about this, I don't really have that much advice other than don't give up. And one of the things I tried to do as a chemistry professor in my group, is I hire people that\nI think that, you know- If they're persistent enough, who am I to deny them the chance? Because, you know, people gave me a chance and I was able to do stuff. - Do you believe in yourself essentially? - So I love being around smart people and I love confusing smart people. And when I'm confusing smart people, and, you know, not by\nstealing their wallets and hiding it somewhere, but if I can confuse smart people, that is the one piece of hope that I might be doing\nsomething interesting. - Well, that's quite brilliant. Like as a gradient to optimize. Hang out with smart\npeople and confuse them. And the more confusing it is, the more there's something there. - And as long as they're not telling you you're just a complete idiot, and they give you different reasons. 'Cause like with assembly theory, when people said, \"Oh, it's wrong.\" And I was like, \"Why?\" And no one could gimme\na consistent reason. They said, \"Oh, because\nit's been done before,\" or \"it's just Kolmogorov,\" or \"it's just there, that, and the other.\" So I think the thing\nthat I like to do is in- And in academia, it's hard, right? 'Cause people are critical. But I mean, you know, the criticism- I mean, although I got kind\nof upset about it earlier, which is kind of silly, but not silly, because obviously it's\nhard work being on your own or with a team, spatially separated, like during lockdown, and\ntry to keep everyone on board and, you know, have some faith. I always wanted to have a new idea. And so, you know, I like a new idea and I wanna nurture it\nas long as possible. And if someone can give\nme actionable criticism. That's what I think I\nwas trying to say earlier when I was kind of like stuck for words. Give me actionable criticism. You know, it's wrong. Okay, why is it wrong? Say, oh, your equation's\nincorrect for this, or your method is wrong. And so what I try and do\nis get enough criticism from people to then\ntriangulate and go back. And I've been very fortunate in my life that I've got great colleagues, great collaborators, funders, mentors and people that will take the time to say, you're wrong because. And then what I have to do\nis integrate the wrongness and go, aah, cool, maybe I can fix that. And I think criticism is really good. People have a go at me\n'cause I'm really critical. I'm like, But I'm not criticizing, you know, you as a person, I'm just criticizing the idea and trying to make it better and say, \"Well, what about\nthis,\" and, you know? And sometimes I'm kind of, you know, my filters are kind of,\nyou know, truncated. And in some ways, I'm just like, \"That's wrong, that's wrong, that's wrong, why'd you do this?\" And people are like, \"Oh\nmy God, you just told me. You destroyed my life's work.\" I'm like, \"Relax, no.\" I'm just like, \"Let's make it better.\" And I think that we don't do that enough 'cause we're either personally critical, which isn't helpful, or we don't give any criticism at all because we're too scared. - Yeah. I've seen you be pretty\naggressively critical, but every time I've seen it, it's the idea, not the person. - I'm sure I make mistakes and that. I mean, you know, I argue with lots- I mean, I argue lots with Sara, and she was like kinda shocked. I've argued with Joscha\nin the past, Joscha Bach, and he's like, \"You're\njust making that up.\" I'm like, \"No, not quite, but kind of.\" You know, I had a big\nargument with Sara about time, and she's like, \"No, time doesn't exist.\" I'm like, \"No, no, time does exist.\" And as she realized that her\nconception of assembly theory and my conception of assembly\ntheory were the same thing, necessitated us to abandon\nthe fact that time is eternal. To actually really fundamentally question how the universe produces\ncombinatorial novelty. - So time is fundamental\nfor assembly theory? 'Cause I'm just trying to figure out where you and Sara converged. - I think assembly theory is\nfine in this time right now, but I think it helps us understand that something interesting is going on. And I'm been really inspired\nby a guy called Nick Gisin. I'm gonna butcher his argument, but I love his argument a lot. So I hope he forgives\nme if he hears about it. But basically, if you want free will, time has to be fundamental. And if you want time to be fundamental, you have to give up on\nplatonic mathematics and you have to use\nintuition as mathematics. And again, I'm gonna butcher this. But basically, Hilbert\nsaid that, you know, \"Infinite numbers are allowed.\" And I think it was Brouwer said, \"No, you can't, all numbers are finite.\" So let's go back a step, 'cause it was like people were gonna say, assembly theory seems to explain that large combinatorial space allows you to produce things\nlike life and technology. And that large combinatorial\nspace is so big it's not even accessible to a Sean Carroll or David Deutsch multiverse. The physicist saying that all of the universe already\nexists in time is probably, provably, that's a\nstrong word, not correct. That we are gonna know that\nthe universe as it stands, the present, the way the\npresent builds the future so big the universe can't\never contain the future. And this is a really interesting thing. I think Max Tegmark has\nthis mathematical universe where he says, \"You know, the universe is kind of like a block universe.\" And I apologize to Max\nif I'm getting it wrong. You have the initial conditions and you can run the\nuniverse right to the end and go backwards and\nforwards in that universe. That is not correct. - Yeah, let me load that in. The universe is not big\nenough to contain the future. - [Lee] Yeah, that's it. - So that's another\nbeautiful way of saying that time is fundamental. - Yes. This is why the law of\nthe excluded middle, something is true or false, only works in the past. Is it gonna snow in New York\nnext week, or in Austin? You might, in Austin, say, probably not. In New York, you might say, yeah. If you go forward to next week and say, did it snow in New York\nlast week, true or false? You can answer that question. The fact that the law\nof the excluded middle cannot apply to the future\nexplains why time is fundamental. - Well, I mean that's a good\nexample, intuitive example. But it is possible that we\nmight be able to predict, you know, whether it's gonna snow if we had the perfect information. You're saying it'd not. - Impossible. Impossible. So here's why. I'll make a really quick argument. And this argument isn't mine, it's Nick's and a few other people. - [Lex] Can you explain his\nview on time being fundamental? - Yeah, so I'll give my view, which kind of resonates with his. But basically, it's very simple actually. It would say that your ability to design and do an experiment is\nexercising free will. So he used that thought process. But I never really\nthought about it that way. And that you actively make decisions. I used to think that free will was a kind of consequence\nof just selection, but I'm kind of understanding\nthat human free will is something really interesting. And he very much inspired me. But a thing what Sara Walker said that inspired me as well. And these will converge. Is that I think that the universe- The universe is very big, huge. But actually, the place that is largest in the universe right now, the largest place in\nthe universe is earth. - Yeah. I've seen you say that, and boy, that's an interesting one to process. What do you mean by that? Earth is the biggest\nplace in the universe. - Because we have this\ncombinatorial scaffolding going all the way back from LUCA. So you've got cells\nthat can self-replicate. And then you go all the way\nto terraforming the earth. You've got all these architectures, the amount of selection that's going on, biological selection, just to be clear, biological evolution. And then you have multicellularity. Then animals, and abstraction. And with abstraction, there was another kick because you can then build architectures, and computers, and cultures, and language. And these things are the\nbiggest things that exist in the universe because we\ncan just build architectures that couldn't naturally arise anywhere. And the further that\ndistance goes in time, and this kind of is gigantic and- - [Lex] From a complexity perspective. - Yeah.\n- Okay, wait a minute. I mean, I know you're being poetic, but how do you know there's\nnot other earth-like- You're basically saying\nearth is really special. It's awesome stuff. As far as we look out, there's nothing like it going on. But how do you know there's\nnot a nearly infinite number of places where cool stuff\nlike this is going on? - I agree. I'll say again that earth\nis the most gigantic thing we know in the universe. Combinatorially, we know. - [Lex] We know. Okay, yeah. - Now, I guess, this\nis just purely a guess, I have no data, but other than hope. Well, maybe not hope. No, I have some data. That every star in the\nsky probably has planets and life is probably\nemerging on these planets. But the amount of contingency\nthat has associated with life is that I think the\ncombinatorial space associated with these planets is so different our causal cones are never\ngonna overlap, or not easily. And this is a thing that\nmakes me sad about alien life. That's why we have to create alien life in the lab as quickly as possible, because I don't know\nif we are gonna be able to build architectures that will intersect with alien intelligence architectures. - And intersect, you don't\nmean in time or space? - [Lee] Time and the\nability to communicate. - So the ability to communicate. - Yeah. My biggest fear, in a way,\nis that life is everywhere, but we've become infinitely more lonely because there are scaffolding\nin that combinatorial space, because it's so big. - So you're saying the constraints created by the environment that led to the factory of Darwinian evolution are\njust a little, tiny cone in a nearly infinite\ncombinatorial space, so there's other cones like it.\n- Exactly. - Why can't we communicate with other- Just because we can't create it doesn't mean we can't\nappreciate the creation, right? Sorry, detect the creation. - I truly don't know, but it's an excuse for\nme to ask for people to give me money to\nmake a planet simulator. - Yeah, right. With a different kind of- - I'm just like another\nshameless scientist, it's like gimme money, I need to play. - This was all a long plugged\nfor a planet simulator. Hey, I will be the\nfirst in line to donate. - My Rick garage has run\nout of room, you know? - [Lex] Yeah. - No- - And this is a planet simulator. You mean, like a different kind of planet or different set sets of\nenvironments and pressures. - Exactly. If we could basically recreate\nthe selection before biology, as we know it, that gives\nrise to a different biology, we should be able to put the constraints on where to look in the universe. So here's the thing, here's my dream. My dream is that by\ncreating life in the lab, based upon constraints we understand. So let's like go for Venus-type life or earth-type life or something again. Do Earth 2.0. Screw it, let's do Earth 2.0. An Earth 2.0 has a\ndifferent genetic alphabet. Fine. That's fine. Different protein alphabet. Fine. Have cells and the\nevolution all that stuff. We will then be able to say, okay, life is a more general phenomena. Selection is more general\nthan what we think is the chemical constraints on life. And we can point the James Webb and other telescopes at other planets. That we are in that zone, we are most likely to\ncombinatorially overlap with, right? So there are chemistry- - [Lex] You're looking for some overlap. - And then, we can then\nbasically shine light on them, literally, and might look\nat light coming back, and apply advanced assembly theory to general theory of\nlanguage, that we'll get, and say, ha, in that signal, it looks random but there's a copy number. Oh, this random set of things that looks like a true and random number generator has structure as not Kolmogorov, AIT-type structure, but\nevolutionary structure, given by assembly theory. But I would say that, 'cause I'm a shameless assembly theorist. - Yeah. It just feels like the cone, I might be misusing the word cone here, but the width of the cone\nis growing really fast to where eventually all the cones overlap, even in a very, very, very\nlarge combinatorial space. But, then again, if\nyou're saying the universe is also growing very quickly\nin terms of possibilities. - I hope that as we build abstractions- I mean, one idea is that\nas we go to intelligence, intelligence allows us to\nlook at the regularities around us in the universe, and that gives us some common grounding to discuss with aliens. And you might be right. That we will overlap there, even though we have completely\ndifferent chemistry, literally completely different chemistry, that we will be able pass\ninformation from one another. But it's not a given. And, you know, I have to kind of try and divorce hope\nand emotion, you know, away from what I can logically justify. - But it's just hard to\nintuit a world, a universe, where there's nearly\ninfinite complexity objects and they somehow can't detect each other. - But the universe is expanding. But the nice thing is I would say- You see, I think Carl Sagan did the wrong, well, not the wrong thing, he flicked the Voyager probe\ndown at a pale, blue dot, said, \"Look at how big the universe is.\" I would've done it the\nother way around and said, \"Look at the Voyager probe that\ncame from the planet earth, that came from LUCA, look at how big earth is.\" - [Lex] They produced that. - It produced that. And I think it's like, completely amazing. And then that should allow people on earth to think about, well,\nprobably we should try and get causal chains off earth onto Mars, onto the moon, wherever. Whether it's human life or\nMartian life that we create, it doesn't matter. But I think this\ncombinatorial space tells us something very important\nabout the universe. And that I realized in assembly theory, that the universe is too\nbig to contain itself. And now coming back, and I want to kind of\nchange your mind about time, 'cause I'm guessing that your\ntime is just a coordinate. - Yeah.\n- So I'm gonna change- - [Lex] I'm guessing you\nare one of those, yeah. - One of those. I'm gonna change your mind in real time, or at least attempt. - Oh, in real time. There you go. I already got the tattoo, so this is gonna be embarrassing\nif you change my mind. - [Lee] But you can just add an arrow of time onto it, right? - Yeah, true. Just modify it. - Or erase it a bit.\n- Yeah. - And the argument that I think that is really most interesting is like, people say the\ninitial conditions specify the future of the universe. Okay, fine, let's say that's\nthe case for a moment. Now let's go back to Newtonian mechanics. Now, the uncertainty principle in Newtonian mechanics is this. If I give you the coordinates of an object moving in space and the coordinates of another object, and they collide in space, and you know those initial conditions, you should know exactly\nwhat's gonna happen. However, you cannot\nspecify these coordinates to infinite precision. Now, everyone said, \"Oh,\nthis is kind of like, you know, the chaos theory argument.\" No, no, it's deeper than that. Here's the problem with numbers. This is where Hilbert\nand Brouwer fell out. To have the coordinates of this object, an given object as it's colliding, you have to have them\nto infinite precision. That's what Hilbert says. He says, \"No problem,\ninfinite precision is fine.\" Let's just take that for granted. But when the object is finite and it can't store its own coordinates, what do you do? - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - So in principle, if a finite\nobject cannot be specified to infinite precision, in principle, the initial conditions don't apply. - Well, how do you it can't store its- - Well, how would you store\nan infinitely long number in a finite size? - Well, we're using\ninfinity very loosely here. - [Lee] No, no, we're using- - Infinite precision. I mean, not loosely, but- - Very precisely.\n- So you think infinite precision is required? - Well, let's take the object. Let's say the object is a golf ball. A golf ball is a few\ncentimeters in diameter, we can work out how many\natoms are on the golf ball. And let's say we can store numbers down to atomic dislocations. So we can work out how many atoms there are in the golf ball, and we can store the coordinates in that golf ball down to that number. But beyond that, we can't. Let's make the golf ball smaller. And this is where I think\nthat we get randomness in quantum mechanics. And some people say you\ncan't get randomness in quantum mechanics, is deterministic. But, aha, this is where we realize that classical mechanics\nand quantum mechanics suffer from the same uncertainty principle. And that is the inability to specify in the initial conditions\nto a precise enough degree to give you determinism. The universe is intrinsically too big. And that's why time exists. It's nondeterministic. Looking back into the past, you can use logical arguments, because you can say, was it true or false? You wouldn't know. But the fact we are unable\nto predict the future with the precision is not\nevidence of lack of knowledge, it's evidence the universe\nis generating new things. - Okay, first of all, quantum mechanics, you can just say statistically\nwhat's gonna happen when two golf balls hit each other. - Statistically. Sure, I can say statistically\nwhat's gonna happen. But then when they do happen, and you keep nesting it together. I mean, it goes almost back to- Let's think about entropy in the universe. How do we understand\nentropy change or a process? We can use the ergodic hypothesis. We can also have the counterfactuals, where we have all the different states. And we can even put that\nin the multiverse, right? But both those, they're nonphysical. The multiverse kind of collapses back to the same problem, about the precision. If you accept you don't have to have true and false going\nforward into the future, the real numbers are real. They're observables. - I'm trying to see exactly where time being fundamental sneaks in. The golf ball can't contain its own position perfectly precisely, how that leads to time\nneeding to be fundamental. - Do you believe or do you\naccept you have free will? - Yeah, I think at this moment in time, I believe that I have free will. - So then you have to believe\nthat time is fundamental. - I understand that's the\nstatement you've made. - Well, no, that we can logically follow. It's because if you don't have free will. So like, if you're in a\nuniverse that has no time, the universe is deterministic. If it's deterministic,\nthen you have no free will. - I think the space of\nhow much we don't know is so vast that saying the\nuniverse is deterministic and from that jumping\nto there's no free will, it's just too difficult of a leap. - No, it logically follows. No, no, I totally disagree. I mean, it's deep and it's important, all I'm saying, and it's actually different\nto what I've said before, is that if you don't require\nPlatonistic mathematics and accept that nondeterminism\nis how the universe looks, and that gives us our creativity in the way the universe\nis getting novelty, it's kind of really deeply\nimportant in assembly theory. 'Cause assembly theory starts to actually give you\na mechanism why you go from boring time, which is basically initial\nconditions specify everything, to a mismatch in creative time. And I hope we'll do experiments. And I think it's really important to- I would love to do an experiment that proves that time is fundamental and the universe is generating novelty. I don't know all the features\nof that experiment yet, but by, you know, having\nthese conversations openly and getting people to think\nabout the problems in a new way, better people, more intelligent people with good mathematical\nbackgrounds can say, oh, hey, I've got an idea. I would love to do an experiment that shows that the universe- I mean, universe is too big for itself going forward in time. And, you know, this is why I really hate the idea of the Boltzmann brain. The Boltzmann brain makes\nme super, kind of like, you know, everyone's having a free lunch. It's like, well, let's break\nall the laws of physics. So a Boltzmann brain is this idea that in a long enough universe the brain will just emerge\nin the universe as conscious. And that neglects the causal chain of evolution required\nto produce that brain. And this is where the\ncomputational argument really falls down, because the computationalist can say, I can calculate probability\nof a Boltzmann brain, and they'll give you a probability. But I can calculate probability\nof a Boltzmann brain. Zero. - Just because the space\nof possibility is so large? - Yeah, it's like when we\nstart fooling ourselves with numbers that we\ncan't actually measure and we can't ever conceive of, I think it doesn't give\nus a good explanation. I want to explain why\nlife is in the universe. I think life is actually\nthe novelty miner. I mean, life basically mines novelty almost from the future and\nactualizes in the present. - Okay. Life is a novelty miner from the future that is actualized in the present. - Yep. I think so.\n- Novelty miner. First of all, novelty. What's the origin of novelty? When you go from boring time to creative time, where's that? Is it as simple as randomness, like you're referring to? - I'm really struggling with randomness because I had a really good argument with Joscha Bach about randomness. And he says that randomness\ndoesn't give you free will. That's insane, 'cause\nyou'd just be random. And I think he's right at that level, but I don't think he is\nright on another level. And it's not about randomness, it's about constrained. I'm gonna sound like- I'm making this up as I go along. So making this up. Constrained opportunity. So the novelty. What is novelty? You know, this is why I\nthink it's a funny thing. Well, if you ever wanna discuss AI. Why I think everyone's kind of gone AI mad is that they're misunderstanding novelty. But let's think about novelty. Yes, what is novelty? So I think novelty is a\ngenuinely new configuration that is not predicted by the past, right? And that you discover\nin the present, right? And that is truly different, right? Some people say that\nnovelty doesn't exist, it's always with precedent. I want to do experiments that show that that is not the case. And it goes back to a question you asked me a few moments ago, which is where is the factory? - Yeah.\n- Right? Because I think the same mechanism that gives us a factory gives us novelty. And I think that is why I'm\nso deeply hung up on time. I mean, of course, I'm wrong, but how wrong? And I think that life opens\nup that combinatorial space in a way that our current laws of physics, as contrived in a deterministic\ninitial condition universe, even with the get-out-of-the-multiverse\nDavid Deutsch-style, which I love, by the way, but I don't think is correct. But it's really beautiful. - [Lex] The multiverse? - The David Deutsch's\nconception of the multiverse is kind of like given. But I think that the problem\nwith wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics is\nnot about the multiverse, it's about understanding\nhow determined the past is. Well, I don't just think that. Actually, this is a\ndiscussion I was having with Sara about that, right? Where she was like, \"Oh, I think-\" We've been debating this\nfor a long time now, about how do we reconcile novelty, determinism, indeterminism? - So, okay, just to clarify. You both, you and Sara think the universe is not deterministic? - I won't speak for Sara, but I roughly can. I think the universe is\ndeterministic looking back in the past, but undetermined\ngoing forward in the future. So I'm kinda having my\ncake and eating it here. This is because I fundamentally don't understand randomness, right? As Joscha told me or other people told me. But if I adopt a new view now. The new view is the universe\nis just nondeterministic. But I'd like to refine that and say the universe appears deterministic\ngoing back in the past, but it's undetermined going\nforward in the future. So how can we have a universe that has deterministically looking rules that's non determined\ngoing into the future? It's breakdown in precision\nin the initial conditions. And we have to just stop\nusing initial conditions and start looking at trajectories and how the combinatorial space behaves in the expanding universe\nin time and space. And assembly theory helps us quantify the transition to biology, and biology appears to be novelty mining, 'cause it's making crazy stuff. You know, that we are\nunique to earth, right? That there are objects\non earth that are unique to earth that will not\nbe found anywhere else, 'cause you can do the combinatorial math. - What was that statement\nyou made about life is novelty mining from the future? - [Lee] Yeah. - What's the little element of\ntime that you're introducing? - So what I'm kinda meaning is 'cause the future is\nbigger than the present, in a deterministic universe, how do the states go from one to another? I mean, there's a mismatch, right? - [Lex] Mm-hmm. Yeah. - So that must mean that\nyou have a little bit of indeterminism,\nwhether that's randomness or something else, I don't understand. I want to do experiments\nto formulate a theory to refine that as we go forward that might help us explain that. And I think that's why I am so determined to try and crack the\nnonlife to life transition looking at networks and molecules and that might help us\nthink about the mechanism. But certainly, the future\nis bigger than the past, in my conception of the universe and some conception of the universe. - By the way, that's not obvious, right? The future being bigger than the past. Well, that's one statement. And the statement that the\nuniverse is not big enough to contain the future\nis another statement. - [Lee] Yeah. - That one is a big one. That one's a really big one. - I think so. But I think it's entirely- Because look, we have the second law. And right now, I mean, we\ndon't need the second law if the future's bigger than the past. It follows naturally.\n- Right. - So why are we retrofitting\nall these sticking plasters onto our reality to hold\nonto a timeless universe? - Yeah, but that's because\nit's kind of difficult to imagine the universe that\ncan't contain the future. - [Lee] But isn't that really exciting? - It's very exciting,\nbut it's (laughs) hard. I mean, we're humans on earth, and we have a very kinda\nfour-dimensional conception of the world, of 3D plus time. It's just hard to intuit a world where- What does it even mean? A universe that can't contain the future? - Yeah, it's kinda crazy but obvious. - It's weird. I mean, I suppose it sounds\nobvious, yeah, if it's true. - So the reason why\nassembly theory turned me onto that was that- Let's just start in the present and look at all the complex molecules and go backwards in time and understand how evolutionary processes gave rise to them. It's not at all obvious. The Taxol, which is one of the most complex natural\nproducts produced by biology, was gonna be invented by biology. It's an accident. You know, Taxol is unique to earth. There's no Taxol\nelsewhere in the universe. And Taxol was not decided\nby the initial conditions. It was decided by this\ninterplay between the- So the past simply is\nembedded in the present, it gives some features. But why the past doesn't map\nto the future, one-to-one, is because the universe is\ntoo big to contain itself. That gives space for creativity, novelty, and some things\nwhich are unpredictable. - Okay, so given that you're disrespecting the power of the initial conditions, let me ask you about- So how do you explain\nthat cellular automata are able to produce such\nincredible complexity given just basic rules and\nbasic initial conditions? - I think that this falls\ninto the Brouwer-Hilbert trap. So how do you get a cellular automata to produce complexity? You have a computer,\nyou generate a display, and you map the change of that in time. There are some CAs repeat, like functions. It's fascinating to me that for pi, there is a formula where you can go to the millionth decimal place of pi and read out the number\nwithout having to go there. But there are some numbers\nwhere you can't do that. You have to just crank through. Whether it's Wolframian\ncomputational irreducibility or some other thing. Well, it doesn't matter. But these CAs, that complexity, is that just complexity, or a number that is\nbasically you're mining that number in time? You know, is that just a display screen for that number, that function? - Well, can't you say the same thing about the complexity on earth, then? - No, because the complexity on earth has a copy number and an assembly\nindex associated with it. That CA is just a number running. - You don't think it has a copy number? Wait, wait a minute. - Well, it does where we're looking at humans producing different rules, but then it's nested on selection. So those CAs are produced by selection. I mean, the CA is such a fascinating pseudo-complexity generator. What I would love to do is quantify the degree of surprise in a\nCA and run it long enough. But what I guess that means is we have to instantiate, we have to have a number\nof this experiments where we're generating different rules and running them time-steps. Ah, I got it. CAs are mining novelty, you know, in the future by iteration, right? And you're like, oh,\nthat's great, that's great. You didn't predict it. Some rules you can predict\nwhat's gonna happen, other rules you can't. So for me, if anything, CAs are evidence that the universe is too\nbig to contain itself. 'Cause otherwise, you'd\nknow what the rules are gonna do forever more. - Right. I guess you were saying\nthat the physicist saying that all you need is\nthe initial conditions and the rules of physics is somehow missing the bigger picture. - Yeah.\n- And, you know, if you look at CAs, all you need is the initial condition and the rules. and then run the thing. - You need three things. You need the initial conditions, you need the rules, and you need time\niteration to mine it out. Without the coordinate,\nyou can't get it out. - Sure. And that is fundamental. - And you can't predict it\nfrom the initial conditions. If you could, then it'd be fine. - [Lex] And that time is- - A resource.\n- Like the foundation of the history, the memory of each of the things it created. It has to have that memory of all the things that led up to it. - Yeah, you have to have the resource. - [Lex] Yeah. - 'Cause time is a fundamental resource. Yeah, I think I had a major\nepiphany about randomness. But I keep doing that every two days, and then it goes away again. It's random. - You're a time fundamentalist. - You should be as well. If you believe in free will, the only conclusion is\ntime is fundamental. Otherwise, you cannot have free will. It logically follows. - Well, the foundation\nof my belief in free will is just observation-driven. I think if you use logic, it's like logically it seems like the universe is deterministic. - Looking backward in time. And that's correct, the universe is. - And then everything\nelse is a kinda a leap. It requires a leap. - This is why I think machine learning is gonna provide a chunk of that, right? To help us explain this. So the way I'd say, if you take- - That's interesting. Why? - 'Cause the AI doomers\nare driving me mad. And we don't have any\nintelligence yet I call AI, autonomous informatics\njust to make people grumpy. - Yeah. You're saying we're\nquite far away from AGI. - I think that we have no\nconception of intelligence and I think that we don't understand how the human brain does what it does. I think that neuroscience\nis making great advances, but I think that we\nhave no idea about AGI. So I am a technological,\nI guess, optimist. I believe we should do everything. The whole regulation of AI is nonsensical. I mean, why would you regulate Excel other than the fact that\nClippy should come back? And I love Excel '97 'cause we can play, you know, we can do the flight simulator. - I'm sorry. In Excel? - Yeah, have you not played\nthe flight simulator in- - In Excel '97?\n- Yeah. - What does that look like? - It's like a wireframe. Very, very basic. But basically, I think it's\nX, zero, Y, zero, Shift, and it opens up and you can\nplay the fight simulator. - [Lex] Oh, wow. Wait, wait. Is he using Excel? - [Lee] Excel. Excel '97. - [Lex] Okay. - I resurrected it the other\nday and saw Clippy again for the first time in a long time. - Well, Clippy is definitely coming back. But you're saying we don't\nhave a great understanding of what is intelligence? What is the intelligence\nunderpinning the human mind? - I'm very frustrated by the way that we're AI dooming right now. And people were bestowing\nsome kind of magic. Now, let's go back a bit. So you said about AGI. Are we far away from AGI? Yes. I do not think we are gonna\nget to AGI anytime soon. I've seen no evidence of it. And the AI doom scenario is\nnonsensical in the extreme. - [Lex] Yeah. - And the reason why I\nthink it's nonsensical. And I don't think there\nisn't things we should do and be very worried about, right? I mean, there are things we\nneed to worry about right now, what AI are doing. Whether it's fake data, fake users, right? I want authentic people or authentic data. I don't want everything to be faked, and I think it's a really big problem. And I absolutely want to go on the record to say I really worry about that. What I'm not worried about is\nthat some fictitious entity is going to turn us all to paperclips or detonate nuclear bombs. I don't know. Maybe. I don't know. Anything you can't think of. Why is this? And I'll take a very simple\nseries of logical arguments. The AI doomers, they do not\nhave the correct episdemiology. They do not understand what knowledge is. And until we understand what knowledge is, they're not gonna get anywhere because they're applying things falsely. So let me give you a very simple argument. People talk about the\nprobability, P-doom, of AI. We can work out the probability of a asteroid hitting the planet. Why? 'Cause it's happened before. We know the mechanism. We know that there's a gravity well, or that, you know, space-time is bent and stuff falls in. We don't know the probability of AGI because we have no mechanism. So let me give you another one. Which is like, I'm\nreally worried about AG. What's AG? AG is antigravity. One day we could wake up\nand antigravity, you know, is discovered, we're all gonna die. The atmosphere's gonna float away. We are gonna float away. We're all doomed. What is the probability of AG? We don't know because\nthere's no mechanism for AG. Do we worry about it? No. And I don't understand the current reason for certain people in certain areas to be generating this nonsense. I think they're not doing it maliciously. I think we're observing the\nemergence of new religions, how religions come. Because religions are\nabout kind of some control. So you've got the optimist\nsaying AI's gonna cure us all and AI's gonna kill us all. What's the reality? Well, we don't have AI, we have really powerful\nmachine learning tools and they will allow us\nto do interesting things. And we need to be careful\nabout how we use those tools in terms of manipulating human beings and faking stuff, right?\n- Right. Well, let me try to sort of (indistinct) in the AI doomers argument. And actually I don't know. Are AI doomers in the\nYudkowsky camp saying it's definitely gonna kill us? 'Cause there's a spectrum. - [Lee] 95% I think is that limit, yeah. - And 95% plus, that's the- - No, no, not plus. I dunno, I was seeing on\nTwitter today various things. But I think Yudkowsky's is at 95%. - But to belong to the AI doomer club, is there a threshold? I don't know what the membership- - Maybe.\n- And what are the fees? - Well, I think Scott Aaronson, like, I was quite surprised. I saw this online, so it could be wrong, so sorry if it's wrong, says 2%. But the thing is, if someone said there's a 2% chance you're\ngonna die going into the lift, would you go into the lift? - In the elevator\n- Yeah, elevator. - For the American\nEnglish speaking audience. Well, no, not for the elevator. - So I would say anyone higher than 2%. I mean, I think there's\na 0% chance of AGI doom. Zero. - Just to push back on the on the argument where at the end of zero on the AGI. We can see on earth that\nthere's increasing levels of intelligence of organisms. We can see what humans\nwith extra intelligence were able to do to the other species. So that is a lot of samples of data what a delta in intelligence gives you. When you have an increase in intelligence, how you're able to dominate\na species on earth. And so the idea there is that if you have a being that's 10x smarter than humans, we are not gonna be able to predict what that being is going to be able to do, especially if it has the\npower to hurt humans. You can imagine a lot of trajectories in which the more benefit AI systems give the more control we\ngive to those AI systems over our power grid,\nover our nuclear weapons or weapons of any sort. And then it's hard to know what a ultra intelligence system would be able to do in that case. You don't find that convincing? - I think I would fail that argument 100%. Here's a number of reasons to fail it on. First of all, we dunno where\nthe intention comes from. The problem is that people think. You know, because I've been watching all the hucksters online\nwith the prompt engineering and all this stuff. When I talk to a typical\nAI computer scientist, they keep talking about the AI as having some kind of\ndecision-making ability. That is a category error. The decision-making ability\ncomes from human beings. We have no understanding of\nhow humans make decision. We've just been discussing free will for the last half an hour, right? We don't even know what that is. So the intention. I totally agree with you, people who intend to do bad\nthings can do bad things and we should not let that risk go. That's totally here and now. I do not want that to happen, and I'm happy to be regulated to make sure that systems I generate, whether they're like computer systems or- You know, I'm working on a new\nproject called ChemMachina. - (chuckles) Nice. Well done.\n- Yeah, yeah. Which is basically a- - (laughing) For people who\ndon't understand the point, the \"Ex Machina\" is a great film about, I guess, AGI embodied. And chem is the chemistry version of that. - And I only know one way\nto embody intelligence, that's in chemistry in human brains. So, category area number\none is they have agency. Category area number two\nis saying that assuming that anything we make is\ngonna be more intelligent. Now you didn't say superintelligent, I'll put the words into our mouths here. Here's superintelligent. I think that there is no reason to expect that we are gonna make systems that are more intelligent, more capable. You know, when people play chess computers they don't expect to win now, right? The chess computer is very good at chess, that doesn't mean it's superintelligent. So I think that superintelligence- Well, I mean, I think even Nick Bostrom is pulling back on this now. So I see this a lot. When did I see it first happen? Eric Drexler, nanotechnology,\natomically precise machines. He came up with a world where we had these atom cogs everywhere, we're gonna make\nself-replicating nanobots. Not possible. Why? Because there's no resources to build these self-replicating nanobots. You can't get the precision. It doesn't work. It was a major category error in taking engineering principles down to the molecular level. The only functioning\nmolecular technology we know- No, sorry. The only functioning\nnano molecular technology we know produced by evolution. There. So now let's go forward to AGI. What is AGI? We dunno. It's super, it can do this, or humans can't think. I would argue the only AGIs\nthat exist in the universe are produced by evolution. And sure, we may be able to\nmake our working memory better, we might be able to do more things. The human brain is the\nmost compact computing unit in the universe. It uses 20 watts. It a uses a really limited volume. It's not like a ChatGPT cluster which has to have thousands of watts, a model that's generated, and it has to be\ncorrected by human beings. You are autonomous and\nembodied intelligence. So I think that there are so many levels that we're missing out. We've just kinda went,\noh, we've discovered fire, oh gosh, the planet's just\ngonna burn one day, randomly. I mean, I just don't understand that leap. There are bigger problems\nwe need to worry about. So what is the motivation? Why are these people, let's assume they have their earnest, have this conviction? Well, I think it's kind\nof they're making leaps, they're trapped in a virtual\nreality that isn't reality. - Well, I mean I can continue\na set of arguments here. But also, it is true that ideologies that fearmonger are dangerous. Because you can then use it to control, to regulate in a way that halts progress, to control people, and to cancel people, all that kinda stuff. So you have to be careful, because the reason ultimately wins, right? But there is a lotta concerns\nwith superintelligent systems, very capable systems. I think when you hear the\nword superintelligent, you're hearing like,\nit's smarter than humans in every way that humans are smart. But the paperclip manufacturing system doesn't need to be smart in every way, it just needs to be\nsmart in specific ways. And the more capable\nthe AI systems become, the more you could see us\ngiving them control over, like I said, our power grid, a lot of aspects of human life. And then that means they'll be able to do more and more damage when there's unintended\nconsequences that come to life. - I think that that's right, the unintended consequences\nwe have to think about. And that I fully agree with. But let's go back a bit. Sentient. I mean, again, I'm far\naway from my comfort zone in all this stuff, but,\nhey, let's talk about it 'cause I'll give myself a qualification. - Yeah, we're both qualified\nand sentience, I think, as much as anyone else. - I think the paperclip scenario\nis just such a poor one. Because let's think about\nhow that would happen. And also, let's think about we are being so unrealistic about how\nmuch of the earth's surface we have commandeered. You know, for paperclip\nmanufacturing to really happen, I mean, do the math. It's not gonna happen. There's not enough energy. There's not enough resource. Where is it all gonna come from? I think that what happens\nin evolution is really. Why has a killer virus not\nkilled all life on earth? Well, what happens is, sure, super killer viruses that kill the ribosome have emerged. But you know what happens? They nuke a small space\nbecause they can't propagate, they all die. So there's this interplay\nbetween evolution and propagation, right? And death. And so- - In evolution? You don't think it's possible\nto engineer, for example, sorry to interrupt, but\nlike a perfect virus- - No\n- That's deadly enough. - No, it's nonsensical. - Okay.\n- I think that just, again, it wouldn't work,\n'cause if it was too deadly, it would just kill the\nradius and not replicate it. - Yeah. I mean, but you don't think\nit's possible to get a- (Lee stammering) Not kill all of life on\nearth, but kill all humans? There's not many of us. There's only like, 8 billion. There's so much more ants. - I mean, I don't-\n- So many more ants. And they're pretty smart. - The nice thing about where we are. I would love for the AI crowd to take a leaf out of the book of the biowarfare, chemical warfare crowd. I mean, not love, 'cause actually people have been killed with chemical weapons in the\nFirst and Second World War, and bio weapons have been made, and, you know, we can argue about COVID-19 and all this stuff. Let's not go there just now. But I think there is a consensus that certain things are bad and we shouldn't do them, right? And sure, it would be\npossible for a bad actor to engineer something bad, but we would see it coming and we would be able to\ndo something about it. Now, I guess what I'm trying to say is when people talk about doom and when you ask them for the mechanism, they just say, you know,\nthey just make something up. I mean, in this case, I'm Yann LeCun. I think he put out a very good point about trying to regulate jet engines before we've even invented them. And I think that's what I'm saying. I just don't understand why these guys are going round literally making stuff up about us all dying, when basically we need to\nactually really focus on. Now, let's say that\nsome actors are earnest. Right, let's say Yudkowsky\nis being earnest, right? And he really cares. But he loves it, he goes, he-he-he, and then you are all gonna die. It's like, you know, why don't\nwe try and do the same thing and say, you could do this, and then you're all gonna\nbe happy forever after. - Yeah.\n- You know? - Well, I think there's\nseveral things to say there. One, I think there is a role in society for people that say we're all gonna die, 'cause I think it filters\nthrough as a message, as a viral message that gives us the proper amount of concern. - Okay. All right. - It's not 95%. But when you say 95%, and it filters through society, it'll give an average of\nlike .03%, an average. So it's nice to have people that are like, \"we're all gonna die,\" then we'll have a proper concern. Like for example, I do believe\nwe're not properly concerned about the threat of\nnuclear weapons currently. It just seems like people have forgotten that that's a thing. And, you know, there's a war in Ukraine with a nuclear power involved. There's nuclear powers\nthroughout the world. And it just feels like were on the brink of a potential world war to a percentage that I don't think people\nare properly calibrating, like, in their head. We're all thinking it's a Twitter battle, as opposed to like actual threat. So like, it's nice to have\nthat kind of level of concern. But to me, like, when I hear AI doomers, what I'm imagining is, with\nunintended consequences, a potential situation where, let's say, 5% of the world suffers deeply because of a mistake made\nof unintended consequences. I don't wanna imagine the entirety of human civilization dying, but there could be a lot of suffering if this is done poorly. - I understand that, and I kind of, I guess, I mean, I'm involved\nin the whole hype cycle. So what's happening right now is there seems to be- So let's say having some people\nsaying AI doom is a worry. Fine, let's give them that. But what seems to be happening is there seems to be people\nwho don't think AI is doom and they're trying to use\nthat to control regulation and to push people to regulate, which stops humans generating knowledge. And I am an advocate for generating as much knowledge as possible. When it comes to nuclear weapons, I grew up in the '70s and '80s where lot of adults really\nhad existential threat. Almost as bad as now with AI doom, they were really worried, right? There were some great, well, not great, there were some horrific documentaries. I think there's one called \"Threads\" that was generated in the UK, which was like, it was terrible. It was like so scary. And I think that the correct thing to do is obviously get rid of nuclear weapons. But let's think about\nunintended consequences. We've got rid of- (Lee muttering) We got rid of all the sulfur particles in the atmosphere, right? All the soot. And what's happened in\nthe last couple of years is global warming has accelerated 'cause we've cleaned up\nthe atmosphere too much. So-\n- Sure. I mean, the same thing if you\nget rid of nuclear weapons, you get-\n- Exactly, that's my point. So what we could do is if we actually started\nto put the AI in charge, which I really like, an AI to be in charge of all world politics. And this just sounds ridiculous\nfor a second, hang on. But if we could all agree on- - [Lex] The AI doomers just woke up. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n- On that statement. - But I really don't like politicians who are basically just\nlooking at local sampling. But if you could say globally, look, here's some game theory here. What is the minimum\nnumber of nuclear weapons we need to distribute around the world to everybody to basically\nreduce war to zero? - I mean, just the start\nexperiment of the United States, and China, and Russia, and major\nnuclear powers get together and say, all right, we're gonna\ndistribute nuclear weapons to every single nation on earth. - [Lee] Yeah. (chuckles) Oh boy. I mean, that has a probably\ngreater than 50% chance of eliminating major military conflict. - Yeah.\n- Yeah, but it's not 100%. - But I don't think anyone will use them. And look, what you've\ngotta try and do is, like, for to qualify for these nuclear weapons- This is a great idea. The game theorists\ncould to do this, right? The question is this. I really buy your question, we have too many nukes. Just from a feeling point of view that we've got too many of them. So let's reduce the number,\nbut not get rid of them, because we'll have too\nmuch conventional warfare. So then, what is the minimum\nnumber of nuclear weapons we can just shoot around to remove- Humans hurting each other is\nsomething we should stop doing? It's not out with our\nconceptual capability. But right now, what about certain nations that are being exploited\nfor their natural resources in the future for a short-term gain because we don't wanna generate knowledge? And so, if everybody had\nan equal doomsday switch, I predict the quality of\nlife for a average human will go up faster. I am an optimist, and\nI believe that humanity is gonna get better and better and better, that we're gonna eliminate more problems. But I think, yeah, let's- - But the probability of a bad actor, of one of the nations\nsetting off a nuclear weapon. I mean, you have to integrate\nthat into the atmosphere. - But we just give you the\nnukes like population, right? What we do is we- (laughing) I can't believe this. But anyway, let's just go there. So if a small nation with\na couple of nukes uses one because they're a bit bored or annoyed, the likelihood that they\nare gonna be pummeled out of existence immediately is 100%. And yet, they've only\nnuked one other city. I know this is crazy, and I apologize for- - Well, no, no. Just to be clear, we're just having a thought experiment. That's interesting, but, you know, there's terrorist organizations that would take that trade. We have to ask ourselves a question of which percentage of humans would be suicide bombers, essentially? Where they would sacrifice their own life because they hate another group of people. I believe it's a very small fraction, but is it large enough if\nyou give out nuclear weapons? - I can predict a future where\nwe take all nuclear material and we burn it for energy, right? 'Cause we're getting there. And the other thing you could do is say, look, there's a gap. So if we get all the countries to sign up to the virtual nuclear\nagreement where we all exist, we have a simulation, where we can each other in the simulation and the economic consequences\nare catastrophic. - Sure. In the simulation. I love it. It's not gonna kill all humans, it's just going to have\neconomic consequences. - [Lee] Yeah. I don't know, I just made it up. It seems like a cool idea.\n- No, it's interesting. I mean, but it's interesting whether that would have as much\npower on human psychology as actual physical nuclear exposure. - I think so.\n- It's possible. But people don't take economic\nconsequences as seriously, I think, as actual nuclear weapons. - I think they do in Argentina,\nand they do in Somalia, and they do in a lot\nof these places where- No, I think this is a great idea. I'm a strong advocate now for- So what've we come up with? Burning all the nuclear\nmaterial to have energy. And before we do that, 'cause mad is good, mutually assured destruction\nis very powerful, let's take it into the metaverse, and then get people to\nkind of subscribe to that. And if they actually nuke each other, even for fun in the metaverse, there are dire consequences. - Yeah. Yeah. So it's like a video game. We all have to join this\nmetaverse video game, and then there's dire\neconomic consequences. And it's all run by AI, as you mentioned, so the AI doomers are really\nterrified at this point. - No, they're happy, they have a job for another 20 years, right? - Oh, okay, fearmongering. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a believer in equal employment. - You've mentioned that,\nwhat did you call it? ChemMachina?\n- Yeah. - Yeah. So you've mentioned that a chemical brain is something you're interested in creating and that's a way to get conscious AI soon. Can you explain what a chemical brain is? - I wanna understand the\nmechanism of intelligence as gone through evolution, right? 'Cause the way that intelligence\nwas produced by evolution appears to be the following. Origin of life. Multicellularity. Locomotion. Senses. Once you can start to see\nthings coming towards you and you can remember the past and interrogate the present and imagine the future, you can do something amazing, right? And I think only in recent years did humans become Turing complete, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - And so, that Turing completeness kinda gave us another kick up. But our ability to\nprocess that information is produced in a wet brain. And I think that we do not have the correct hardware architectures to have the domain flexibility and the ability to integrate information. I think intelligence also comes at a massive compromise of data. Right now, we're obsessing about\ngetting more and more data, more and more processing, more and more tricks to get dopamine hits. So when we look back on this, going, oh yeah, that was really cool, 'cause when I asked ChatGPT, it made me feel really happy. I got a hit from it, but actually it just exposed\nhow little intelligence I use in every moment,\nbecause I'm easily fooled. So what I would like to do is to say, well, hey, hang on, what\nis it about the brain? So the brain has this\nincredible connectivity and it has the ability to, you know, as I said earlier about\nmy nephew, you know, I went from Bill to Billy and\nhe went, \"oh right, Leroy.\" Like, how did he make that leap? That he was able to basically,\nwithout any training. I extended his name, that he doesn't like. He wants to be called Bill. He went back and said, \"You\nliked to be called Lee, I'm gonna call you Leroy.\" So human beings have a brilliant ability- Or, intelligent beings appear\nto have a brilliant ability to integrate across all\ndomains all at once, and to synthesize something which allows us to generate knowledge. And become Turing complete on our own, although AI's a built-in\nTuring complete things, their thinking is not Turing complete in that they are not able to\nbuild universal explanations. And that lack of universal explanation means that they're just inductivist. Inductivism doesn't get you anywhere. It's just basically a party trick. I think it's in the \"Fabric of\nReality\" from David Deutsch, where basically, you know, the farmer is feeding\nthe chicken every day and the chicken's getting fat and happy. And the chicken's like, \"I'm really happy every time the farmer\ncomes in and feeds me.\" And then, one day, the farmer comes in and instead of feeding the chicken, just wrings its neck, you know? And had the chicken had an\nalternative understanding of why the farmer was feeding it. - It's interesting though, because we don't know what's special about the human mind\nthat's able to come up with these kinda generalities, this universal theories of things. And to come up with novelty. I can imagine, 'cause you\ngave an example, you know, about William and Leroy. I feel like a example\nlike that we'll be able to see in future versions\nof large language models. We'll be really, really,\nreally impressed by the humor, the insights, all of it. Because it's fundamentally trained on all the incredible humor and insights that's available out there\non the internet, right? I think we'll be impressed. - [Lee] Oh, I'm impressed. - Right, increasingly so. - But we're mining the past.\n- Yes. - And what the human brain\nappears to be able to do is mine the future.\n- Yes. It's a novelty. It is interesting whether\nthese large language models will ever be able to come up with something truly novel. - I can show on the\nback of a piece of paper why that's impossible. And it's like, the problem is that, and again, these are domain experts kind of bullshitting each other. The term generative.\n- Yes. - Right? Average person thinks,\noh, it's generative. No, no, no. If I take the numbers\nbetween zero and 1000 and I train a model to\npick out the prime numbers by giving all the prime\nnumbers between zero and 1000. It doesn't know what a prime number is. Occasionally, if I can cheat a bit, it will start to guess. It never will produce\nanything out with the dataset because you mine the past. The thing that I'm getting to is I think that actually current\nmachine learning technologies might actually help reveal\nwhy time is fundamental. It's like kind of insane. Because they tell you about\nwhat's happened in the past, but they can never help you\nunderstand what's happening in the future without training examples. Sure, if that thing\nhappens again, it's like- So let's think about what large\nlanguage models are doing. We have all the internet as we\nknow it, you know, language. But also, they're doing something else. We're having human beings\ncorrecting it all the time. Those models are being corrected. - Steered. - Corrected. Modified. Tweaked. - [Lex] Well yeah, but I mean- - Cheating. - (chuckles) Well, you\ncould say the training on human data in the first\nplace is cheating but- - The human is in the\nloop. Sorry to interrupt. - Yeah, so human is\ndefinitely in the loop. But it's not just human is in the loop, a very large collection\nof humans is in the loop. And that could be- I mean, to me, it's not intuitive that you said prime numbers, that the system can't\ngenerate an algorithm, right? That the algorithm that\ncan generate prime numbers, or the algorithm that can tell you if a number prime and so on, and generate algorithms\nthat generate algorithms that generate algorithms that start to look a lot like human\nreasoning, you know? - I think, again, we can show\nthat on a piece of paper. That, sure. So this is the failure in episdemiology. Like, I'm glad I even can say that word, let alone know what it means, right? - You said it multiple times. - I know, it's like three times now. - Without failure Quit while you're ahead. Just don't say it again,\n'cause you did really well. - Yeah, thanks. So what is reasoning? So coming back to the chemical brain, if I could show that in a- 'Cause, I mean, I'm never gonna make an intelligence in ChemMachina, because if we don't have brain cells they don't have glial cells, they don't have neurons. But if I can take a gel\nand engineer the gel to have it be a hybrid\nhardware for reprogramming, which I think I know how to do, I'll process a lot more information and train models billions of times cheaper and use cross-domain knowledge. And there's certain\ntechniques I think we can do. But it's still missing the abilities of human beings that had\nto become Turing complete. And so, I guess the\nquestion to give back at you is like, how do you tell the difference between trial and error and the\ngeneration of new knowledge? I think the way you can do it is this. Is that you come up with\na theory, an explanation, just inspiration comes from out, yeah. You test that, and then you see that's\ngoing towards the truth. And human beings are\nvery good at doing that in the transition between philosophy, mathematics, physics,\nand natural sciences. And I think that we can see that. Where I get confused is\nwhy people misappropriate the term artificial intelligence to say, hey, there's\nsomething else going on here. Because I think you and I both agree, machine learning's really good. It's only gonna get better, we're gonna get happier with the outcome. But why would you ever think the model is thinking, or reasoning? Reasoning requires intention. And the intention, if the\nmodel isn't reasoning, the intentions come from the prompter, and the intentions come from the person who programmed it to do it. - But don't you think you can\nprompt it to have intention? Basically start with\nthe initial conditions and get it going. You know, currently large language models, ChatGPT, only talks to\nyou when you talk to it. There's no reason why you\ncan't just start it talking. - But those initial conditions came from someone starting it, and that causal chain in there. So that intention comes from the outside. I think that there is something in that causal chain of\nintention that's super important. I don't disagree we're gonna get to AGI, it's a matter of when and what hardware. I think we're not gonna\ndo it in this hardware, and I think we're\nunnecessarily fetishizing really cool outputs and dopamine hits, because obviously that's\nwhat people wanna sell us. - I mean, AGI is a loaded term, but there could be incredibly super impressive intelligence\nsystems on the way to AGI. So these large language models, if it appears conscious, if it appears superintelligent, who are we to say it's not? - I agree. But superintelligence, I want to be able to have a discussion with it about coming up with fundamental new ideas that generate knowledge. And if the superintelligence\nwe generate can mine novelty from the future, that I didn't\nsee in its training set in the past, I would agree that something really interesting is coming on. I'll say that again, if the intelligence system, be it a human being, a chatbot, something else, is able to\nproduce something truly novel that I could not predict, even having a full audit\ntrail from the past, then I'll be sold. - Well, so it should be clear\nthat it can currently produce things that are in a shallow sense novel that are not in the training set. But you're saying truly novel? - I think they are in the training set. I think everything it produces\ncomes from a training set. There's a difference between\nnovelty and interpolation. We do not understand where\nthese leaps come from yet. That is what intelligence\nis, I would argue. Those leaps. And some people say, \"No, it's actually just what will happen if you\njust do cross-domain training and all that stuff.\" And that may be true, and I may be completely wrong. But right now, the human\nmind is able to mine novelty in a way that artificial\nintelligence systems cannot. And this is why we still have a job and we're still doing stuff. And, you know, I used\nChatGPT for a few weeks, \"Oh, this is cool.\" Well, what happened is,\nit took me too much time to correct it, then it got really good, and now they've done something to it. It's not actually that good. - [Lex] Yeah. Right. - I Don't know what's going on. - Censorship, yeah. I mean, that's interesting, but it will push us humans to\ncharacterize novelty better. Like, what is novel? What is truly novel? What's the difference between\nnovelty and interpolation? - I think that this is\nthe thing that makes me most excited about these technologies, is they're gonna help\nme demonstrate to you that time is fundamental and the unit future is\nbigger than the present, which is why human beings are quite good at generating novelty because we have to expand our data set and to cope with unexpected things in our environment. Our environment throws 'em all at us. Again, we have to survive\nin that environment. Never say never. I would be very interested in how we can get cross-domain training\ncheaply in chemical systems, 'cause I'm a chemist and the\nonly sentient thing I know of is the human brain, but maybe that's just me\nbeing boring and predictable and not novel. - Yeah, you mentioned\nGPT for electron density. So a GPT-like system\nfor generating molecules that can bind to host automatically. I mean, that's interesting. That's really interesting. Applying this to the same\nkind of transform mechanism. - Yeah. I try and do things that are non-obvious but non-obvious in certain areas. And one of the things I\nwas always asking about. In chemistry, people like to\nrepresent molecules as graphs. And it's quite difficult. Well, if you're doing AI and chemistry, you really want to basically\nhave good representations so you can generate new\nmolecules that are interesting. And I was thinking, well, molecules aren't really graphs and they're not\ncontinuously differentiable. Could I do something that was\ncontinuously differentiable? Well, I was like, \"Well,\nmolecules are actually made up of electron density.\" So then I got thinking, and said, \"Well, okay, could there be a way where we could just\nbasically take a database of readily solved electron densities for millions of molecules. So we took the electron density for millions of molecules\nand just trained the model to learn what electron density is. And so what we built was a system that you literally could give it a- Let's say you could take a protein that have a particular active site or, you know, a cup with a certain hole in it, and you pour noise into it, and with the GPT you turn the\nnoise into electron density. And then, in this case, it hallucinates, like all of them do. But the hallucinations are good because it means I don't have to train on such a huge data set, 'cause these data sets are very expensive. 'Cause how do you produce it? So go back a step. So you've got all these molecules in this data set, but what you've literally done is a quantum mechanical calculation where you produce electron\ndensities for each molecule. So you say, oh, this\nrepresentation of this molecule has these electron densities\nassociated with it, so you know what the representation is, and you train the neural\nnetwork should know what electron density is. So then you give it an unknown pocket, you pour in noise, and you say, right, produce me electron density. It produces electron density\nthat doesn't look ridiculous. And what we did in this case is we produce electron density that maximizes the\nelectrostatic potential, so the stickiness, but minimizes what we\ncall the steric hindrance, so the overlaps, so it's repulsive. So they, you know, make the perfect fit. And then, we then use a kind\nof like a ChatGPT type thing to turn that electron density\ninto what's called a smile. A smile string is a way of representing a molecule and letters. And then, we can then- - [Lex] So it just generates them then? - It just generates them. And then the other thing is, then we bung that into the computer and then it just makes it. - Yeah. The computer being the\nthing that, you're right, that could generate it.\n- Yeah, the robot that we've got that can basically just do chemistry. - Creating the-\n- Yeah. So we've kind of got this\nend-to-end drug discovery machine where you can say, oh, you want to bind to this active site? Here you go. I mean, it's a bit leaky\nand things kind of break, but it's the proof of principle. - But were the hallucinations,\nare those still accurate? - Well, the hallucinations\nare really great in this case. 'Cause in the case of\na large language model, hallucinations just make everything up. Well, it doesn't just make everything up, but it gives you an output that you're plausibly comfortable with and it thinks you're\ndoing probabilistically. The problem on these\nelectron density models is it's very expensive to\nsolve a Schrodinger equation going up to many heavy\natoms and large molecules. And so, we wondered if\nwe trained the system on up to nine heavy atoms, whether it would go beyond nine. And it did. It started to generate\nmolecules of 12, no problem. They looked pretty good. And I was like, \"Well, this\nhallucination I will take for free, thank you very much.\" This is a case where\ninterpolation extrapolation worked relatively well and we were able to generate\nthe really good molecules. And then, what we were able to do here is, and this is a really good point of what I was trying to say earlier, that we were able to\ngenerate new molecules from the known dataset that\nwould bind to the host, so a new guest would bind. Were these truly novel? Not really, because they\nwere constrained by the host. Were they new to us? Yes. So I do, well, understand. I can concede that\nmachine learning systems, artificial intelligence systems, can generate new entities. But how novel are they? It remains to be seen. - Yeah, and how novel the\nthings that humans generate is also difficult to quantify. They seem novel. - That's what a lotta people say. So the way to really\nget to genuine novelty, and assembly theory shows you the way, is to have different\ncausal chains overlap. And this really resonates with the time is fundamental argument. And if you're bringing\ntogether a couple of objects with different initial\nconditions coming together, when they interact, the more different their histories, the more novelty they generate\nin time going forward. And so, it could be that genuine novelty is basically about mix it up a little. And the human brain is\nable to mix it up a little, and all that stimulus\ncomes from the environment. But all I think I'm saying is the universe is deterministic\ngoing back in time, nondeterministic going forward in time, 'cause the universe is\ntoo big in the future to contain in the present. Therefore, these\ncollisions of known things generate unknown things\nthat then become part of your data set and don't appear weird. That's how we give ourselves comfort. The past looks consistent with this initial condition hypothesis, but actually we're generating\nmore and more novelty. And that's how it works. Simple. - (chuckles) So it's hard to quantify novelty looking backwards. I mean, the present and the future are the novelty generators. - But I like this whole\nidea of mining novelty. I think it is gonna reveal why the limitations of current AI is a bit like a printing press, right? Everyone thought that when\nthe printing press came, that writing books is gonna be terrible, that you had evil spirits and all this. They were just books. - And the same with AI. But I think just a scale you can achieve in terms of impact with AI\nsystems is pretty nerve-racking. - That's what the big\ncompanies want you to think. - But not like in terms\nof destroy all humans, but you can have major consequences in the way social media\nhas had major consequences, both positive and negative. And so, you have to kinda\nthink about and worry about it. But yeah, people that\nfearmonger, you know- - My pet theory for this, you wanna know? - [Lex] Yeah. - Is I think that a lotta, and I really do respect, you know, a lot of the people out there who are trying to have discourse\nabout the positive future, so OpenAI guys, Meta guys, and all this. What I wonder, if they're\ntrying to cover up for the fact that social media's had a pretty disastrous\neffect on some level, and they're just trying to say, ah yeah, we should do this. And covering up for the fact that we have got some problems with, you know, teenagers, and Instagram, and Snapchat, and, you know, all that stuff. And maybe they're just overreacting now. It's like, \"Oh yeah, sorry, we made the bubonic plague\nand gave it to you all, and you're all dying, and, oh yeah. But well, look at this over\nhere, it is even worse.\" - Yeah, there's a little bit of that. But there's also not enough celebration of the positive impact that all\nthese technologies have had. We tend to focus on the negative and tend to forget that- In part, because it's hard to measure. Like, it's very hard to measure the positive impact social\nmedia had on the world. - Yeah, I agree. What I worry about right now is like I do care about the ethics\nof what we're doing, and one of the reasons why I'm so open about the things we're\ntrying to do in the lab, make life, look at intelligence, all this, is so people say, \"What are\nthe consequences of this?\" And you say, \"What are the\nconsequences of not doing it?\" And I think that what\nworries me right now, in the present, is the\nlack of authenticated users and authenticated data and- - Human users.\n- Yeah, human- - I still think that\nthere will be AI agents that appear to be conscious, but they would have to\nbe also authenticated and labeled as such. 'Cause there's too much\nvalue in that, you know, like friendships with AI systems. There's too much meaningful\nhuman experiences to have with AI systems that I just... - But that's like a tool, right? It's a bit like a meditation tool, right? Some people have a meditation tool, it makes them feel better. But I'm not sure you can ascribe sentience and legal rights to a chatbot that makes you feel less lonely. - Sentience, yes. I think legal rights, no. I think it's the same. You can have a really deep\nmeaningful relationship with a dog and a pet. - Well, the dog's sentient. - [Lex] Yes. - The chatbot's right now, using the technology we use\nis not gonna be sentient. - Aah, that's gonna be a\nfun continued conversation on Twitter that I look forward to. Since you've had also, from another place, some debates that were inspired by the assembly theory paper, let me ask you about God. Is there any room for notions\nof God in assembly theory? Whose God? - Yeah, I don't know what God is. I mean, so God exists in our mind, created by selection. So human beings have\ncreated the concept of God in the same way that\nhuman beings have created the concept of superintelligence. - Sure. It still could mean\nthat that's a projection from the real world, where like we're just assigning words and concepts to a thing\nthat is fundamental to the real world. That there is something out there that is a creative force\nunderlying the universe. - There is a creative\nforce in the universe, but I don't think it's sentient. So, I do not understand the universe, so who am I to say, you\nknow, that God doesn't exist? I am an atheist, but I'm not an angry atheist, right? There are some people I\nknow that are angry atheists and say, you know-\n- Yeah, cranky. - Say that religious people are stupid. I don't think that's the case. Yeah, I have faith in some things, 'cause I mean, when I was a kid, you know, I was like, \"Well, I need to know what\nthe charge of a electron is.\" And I'm like, \"I can't measure\nthe charge of a electron.\" You know, I just gave up and had faith. Okay, you know, resistors worked. I want to know why the universe is growing in the future and what\nhumanity's gonna become. And I've seen that the\nacquisition of knowledge via the generation of\nnovelty to produce technology has uniformly made humans' lives better. I would love to continue that tradition. And- - You said that there's\nthat creative force. Just to think on that point, do you think there's a creative force? Is there like a thing, like a driver that's creating stuff? - So I think that- - And where? What is it? Can you describe like mathematical? - Well, I think selection. I think selection.\n- Selection is the force. - Selection is the force in the universe that creates novelty. - So is selection somehow fundamental? - Yeah. I think persistence of objects that could decay into nothing through operations that\nmaintain that structure. I mean, think about it. It's amazing that things exist at all, that we're just not a\nbig combinatorial mess. - [Lex] Yes. - So the fact that- - A thing that exists, persistent time. - Yeah. Let's think, maybe the universe is actually in the present. Everything that can exist\nin the present does exist. - Well, that would mean\nit's deterministic, right? - So the universe started super small, the past was deterministic, there wasn't much going on, and it was able to mine,\nmine, mine, mine, mine. And so the process, I mean, is somehow generating- The universe is basically- I'm trying to put this into words. - Did you just say there's\nno free will, though? - [Lee] No, I didn't say that. - 'Cause it everything that can exist- - Sorry. I said there is free will. I'm saying that free will\noccurs at the boundary between the- - The past and the future?\n- The past and the future. - Yeah, I got you. But everything that can exist does exist. - So, everything that's\npossible to exist at this- So, no. I'm really- - There's a lotta loaded words there. In that there's a time element\nloaded into that statement. - I think the universe\nis able to do what it can in the present, right?\n- Yeah. - And then, I think in the future, there are other things\nthat could be possible. We can imagine lots of things, but they don't all happen. - Sure. That's where you sneak in\nfree will, right there. - Yeah. So I guess what I'm saying is what exists is a convolution of the\npast with the present and the free will going into the future. - Well, we could still\nimagine stuff, right? We could imagine stuff\nthat will never happen. - And it's a amazing force. The most important thing\nthat we don't understand is our imaginations can actually change the future in a tangible way, which is what the initial conditions and physical cannot predict. Like, your imagination\nhas a causal consequence in the future. - Isn't that weird to you? - Yeah. - How do you- Hmm?\n- It does break the laws of physics as we know them right now. - Yeah. So you think the imagination has a causal effect on the future? - Yeah.\n- But it does exist in there, in the head. - It does, but-\n- And it must be a lot of power in whatever's going on. There could be a lot of power, whatever's going on in there. - If we then go back to\nthe initial conditions. It's simply not possible that can happen. But if we go into a\nuniverse where we accept that there is a finite\nability to represent numbers and you have rounding- Well, not rounding errors. What happens, your\nability to make decisions, imagine, and do stuff is at that interface between the certain and the uncertain. It's not, as Joscha was saying to me, randomness goes and you just, you know, randomly do random stuff. It is that you are set free\na little on your trajectory. Free will is about being able to explore on this narrow trajectory that allows you to build. You have a choice about what you build. Or that choice is you interacting with a future in the present. - What to you is most beautiful\nabout this whole thing? The universe? - The fact it seems to be\nvery undecided, very open. The fact that every time I\nthink I'm getting towards an answer to a question, there are so many more questions that make the chase, you know? - Do you hate that it's gonna\nbe over at some point for you? - Well, for me. I think if you think about it, is it over for Newton now? Newton has had causal\nconsequences in the future. We discuss him all the time. - His ideas, but not the person. - The person just had a lot of causal power when he was alive. But, oh my God, one of\nthe things I wanna do is leave as many Easter eggs in the future when I'm gone to go, \"Oh, that's cool.\" - Would you be very upset if somebody made like a good large language model that's fine-tuned to Lee Cronin? - It would be quite boring 'cause I mean- - [Lex] No novelty generation? - If it's a faithful\nrepresentation of what I've done in my life, that's great. That's a interesting artifact. But I think the most interesting thing about knowing each other is we don't know what we're gonna do next. - Sure. (sighs) Sure. - I mean, within some constraints, I can predict some things about you, you can predict some things about me, but we can't predict everything. - [Lex] Everything. - And it's because we\ncan't predict everything is why we're excited to come\nback, and discuss, and see. So yeah, it'll be\ninteresting that some things that I've done can be captured, but I'm pretty sure that\nmy angle on mining novelty from the future will not be captured. - Yeah. Yeah. So that's what life is, it's just some novelty generation, and then you're done. Each one of us just generate a little bit. Or have the capacity to, at least. - Selection produces life and\nlife affects the universe, and universes with life\nin them are materially and physically fundamentally different than universes without life. And that's super interesting. And I have no beginnings of understanding. I think maybe this is like in 1000 years, there'll be a new discipline, and the humans will be like, \"Yeah, of course, this is\nhow it all works, right? - In retrospect, it will\nall be obvious, I think. - I think assembly theory is obvious, that's why a lot of\npeople got angry, right? They were like, \"Oh my God,\nthis is such nonsense.\" - Yeah.\n- You know, and like, \"Oh, you know, actually, it's not quite, but the writing's really bad.\" - Well, I can't wait to\nsee where it evolves, Lee. And I'm glad I get to exist\nin this universe with you, you're a fascinating human. This is always a pleasure. I hope to talk to you many more times, and I'm a huge fan of just watching you create stuff in this world. And thank you for talking today. - It's a pleasure, as always, Lex. Thanks for having me on. - Thanks for listening to this\nconversation with Lee Cronin. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with\nsome words from Carl Sagan. \"We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the\ndepth of our answers, our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good.\" Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time."
