      "text": "- So contempt is criticism on steroids. This is what John Gottman\ncalls sulfuric acid for love. Nothing will erode a relationship\nquicker than contempt. Contempt is when you are\nlooking at your partner from a superior position. So you are eye rolling, you are name calling, there's a mockery, mocking, even physical\nmockery, imitating them, imitating their voice. Contempt is meant to\njust take the legs out from your partner, make\nthem feel pathetic, ridiculous, and it can be abusive, but most people have engaged in contempt at some point in their relationship. Lower level would be\nsort of the eye rolling, but that is the biggest\npredictor of a split. - The following is a\nconversation with Shannon Curry, a clinical and forensic psychologist who conducts research, therapy\nand psychological evaluations pertaining to trauma,\nviolence and relationships. She received worldwide\nattention in April of last year by giving a lengthy televised testimony on her psychological\nevaluation of Amber Heard during the Johnny Depp/Amber Heard trial. I found her testimony to\nbe an eloquent description of complex psychological concepts and evaluations procedures. So I reached out for a chat. In person, she was brilliant, funny, thoughtful, and truly kind. I really, really enjoyed\nthis conversation. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Shannon Curry."

      "text": "Charles Bukowski said that\nlove is a fog that burns away with the first daylight of reality. I love that quote. Do you think romantic love\nfades away in this way? - Bukowski.\n- Does it have to fade? - The truth is that you\nhave all of these chemicals pumping through your body. You're essentially high on heroin in the beginning of a romance, and you're going to have\nthese rose-colored glasses on. Everything your partner does is magical. But really it's the novelty. It's just like going on a\nvacation. You're fully present. You're just attuned to the\nmagic of another human being, moment to moment. And then on top of that, you have, you're just flooded with dopamine. So you're high on drugs. And\nwe can't go on like that. You will die if you are using\nthese kinds of chemicals all the time, all day long. So eventually our bodies are\nsort of made to dial it down. We've made it. I mean, we\nare evolutionary beings. We are doing the same thing\nwe did 200,000 years ago to find a mate, procreate, spend\nenough time with each other that we have sex a whole bunch\nof times and make babies. Now we've changed the rules of the game. We're living, you know, almost till we're 100\nyears old, in some cases, we're making these marriage commitments that last half a century, and we're expecting it to\nbe all because of love. And we're signing these\ncontracts based on how we feel when we're high on these drugs. So the reality is we know based on the... And I'm also talking about certain western civilizations\nhere, because as you know, there are arranged marriages. And a lot of times, those marriages, if we're looking at longevity, are actually way more satisfied than people who are marrying for love, which logically makes sense. If you're making a\ndecision based on a feeling that is basically based on endorphins and dopamine and oxytocin, I wouldn't sign a contract\njust because of a feeling, necessarily, you know, for 50 years. Whereas an arranged marriage, if you have your elders\nkind of deciding for you that this partner has a bunch of traits that you're going to appreciate\nmore and more over time, I think there's some wisdom there. - So you don't think that\nfeeling could be a foundation for a 50-year relationship? - Well, I don't think\nthat specific feeling you're having based on drugs\nis going to be the same feeling you have 20, 30, 40 years down the line. If you're gonna wake up\nand turn to your partner when you're 70 and think, oh\nmy God, I'm so glad you're hot. You are so hot. Then\nsure, marry for hotness. But if you've been\nthrough life a little bit, and I think most people who\nare on a second marriage know, shit happens in life, it is hard. You're gonna have, you know,\nmaybe a kid with special needs or your dad gets dementia or\nyou get diagnosed with cancer. Who are you gonna wanna come home to? Who is going to hold you when\nyou are sobbing on the floor and tell you, \"We're gonna\nget through it together\"? Who's gonna know the names of\nyour kid's special ed teacher and the process for getting a 504 plan? Or is it gonna be you on your own? I think those things matter. - But doesn't that hotness, don't those drugs kind of solidify into a deeper appreciation\nof the other person into something you could call beauty? - Yes, they can.\n- But isn't that the same? Isn't that the same thing? When you notice the beauty\nof another human being, aren't you high on drugs still? You're making it sound like there's like a brief rockstar period of going on heroin and then it's over. But like, can't you be on\nheroin your whole life, or like- - I have some good news.\n- Microdosing. - I have some good news. That was something, I think one of the reasons I\ngot into studying relationships was because I wanted that, right? So I'm a scientist, but I also love art and I love writing and I love literature. I wanted to know that\ntrue love could be real, but as a scientist, I am cynical. I just need some data. And so I practice a type of therapy"

      "text": "called the Gottman Method. And I love that because it tends to be, well, it is one of the most\nevidence-based therapies we have based on John and Julie Gottman, two psychologists who have\nbeen researching relationships for now about 50 years. And this therapy happens\nto be for couples. They found that you absolutely\ncan make longevity work in a relationship. You can build. You are not just settling\nfor companionship, but you can have passion and intimacy and growing love and appreciation. But there is a blueprint, a set of skills that we were never given, we're not taught it in school. We changed the rules of the game and we haven't learned the rules yet. - And the Gottman Method\nfor couples therapy kind of gives you a few guidelines, the rules for longevity in a relationship. - Yeah, they did a beautiful\njob at taking these findings they had through, you\nknow, decades of research, quantifying it and then codifying\nit into a therapy method. It's really skills-based. I tell couples when they're\nstarting out with me that they're essentially\ngonna be starting a class. - So what's the 5 to 1 golden rule? What I read is there's the\nkind of balance you can achieve of how many interactions\nyou have in a relationship that are positive versus negative. And I think that's what the 5 to 1 means. But basically, there should\nbe kind of an empirical, like if you just look back over a month, how many of the\ninteractions were positive, how many were negative.\n- Or the day. Look at the day, right? So the idea of this ratio,\nwell, it's not an idea, it was a finding, it is a research finding that the Gottman's got after\nlooking at thousands of couples and codifying these interactions\nthat they were observing. Couples that tend to be\nsatisfied in their relationships, that are happier, they have\nbetter health, et cetera, they are having approximately\nfive positive interactions to each negative. And I wanna be clear about\nwhat I'm defining as positive and negative here. So this doesn't necessarily\nmean that you're, these don't need to be big,\nsweeping, romantic gestures, buying flowers, having sex. These are things like paying attention to what we call your partner's bids. We make these bids for affection, for connection all the\ntime in our relationships, not just with our partners,\nbut with our friends, our coworkers. And we may not even know\nwhat our style of bid is, but if you see them on a sheet, you can pretty quickly identify them. Bids could be wanting to show your partner or tell your partner something and have them be proud of you. It could be wanting to go buy\ngroceries with your partner, doing things together. \"Hey, you wanna come with me?\" It could be telling a joke\nand hoping that your wife looks up from her email on the\ncomputer and acknowledges it. If she laughs, then you've got a positive. But if I don't even look up,\nthat's a negative, right? So it's not necessarily\nthat I'm calling my husband an asshole, it's just am\nI connecting with him? Am I meeting those bids for\nconnection and vice versa? - Do those also give you a\nguide of how you should behave? - Well, I think what's really important is actually asking your\npartner or paying attention to what your partner's bids are. Because what matters to Ty, my husband, may not matter to you. For instance, I mean, Ty's bar is so low with me. I thank God for him. - [Lex] In terms, what defines\na positive interaction? - Right, like he just wants me to ask him if he wants a water when I\nget up to get myself one. Just be a basic, decent,\nconsiderate person is all he asks of me. Whereas mine might be sort of\nlike, stay up later with me, watch a show, go to bed\nat the same time as me or know about the people in\nmy life, that sort of a thing. - I should highlight this and I hope, hopefully it's okay that you\nwere running a little bit late and you sent me this text,\nwhich people do really rarely, and there's a subtle act of\nkindness within that text. So the text you sent was\nthat I just decreased the amount of stress in your\nlife or something like this by saying it's cool. But that means that you were, you're signaling that you were stressed because you care enough\nto be there on time. And that was like, that\nmade me feel really special. I was like, \"Oh,\" you know, people don't often-\n- You're a brilliant guy. - People don't always do that because that puts you also,\nthat makes you vulnerable. - Vulnerable.\n- And that- - I actually thought that after I sent it. But I feel that most of the\nday, any interaction like, oh God, I just exposed myself. But absolutely, I was excited to be here and I didn't want you to\nthink that I didn't care. I think being a therapist\nhas shown me that it really, it's so lucky to be in that\nposition because you meet people that you would've thought\nare cooler than you or smarter than you, or just\nsomehow impervious to life. And you realize that we\nare all in it together. We all want to be cared about and liked. We all wanna be liked as a baseline. Some people will say they don't care, but everybody does, it's human. And I have gotten much\nbetter being a therapist, much more comfortable showing caring, showing love and genuineness\nand vulnerability than I think I ever\nwould've been otherwise. - And that kind of\nvulnerability is what's required to do a positive interaction\nin a relationship. - I think so. And people have different\nlevels of comfort, right? But as long as it's\nworking for both partners. And typically, you have to communicate to figure out what makes your\npartner feel cared about. However you might be\nworking, for instance, with an older couple, and I have a couple that's perfectly happy and they sort of have a\nsystem, it works for them. If there's some sort of a rupture, if they get in to some\nsort of a disagreement, they don't talk it out. She might go to the store, run an errand, do a little shopping. He'll work in the wood shop\nand then they'll come back and there is a repair attempt, though. But it's maybe she'll say, \"Hey, do you wanna have\ndinner or come, you know, I made your favorite dinner.\" Or he'll say, \"Hey, I\nrecorded your favorite show, you wanna watch it tonight.\" So they don't need to process it. But there is an understanding between them that we're still in this together, we care about each other and\nthere's a repair attempt. Most people need to be\nable to process it verbally and talk about what happened. - Oh, interesting.\n- But not all. - So for most people, if there's a conflict you\nshould talk about and resolve it and repair it versus like\njust put it behind you. - I don't wanna say should. I guess it depends on the couple. Everybody processes emotions differently. Everybody handles emotional\nexpression differently. I mean, I have couples\nwhere I have one person in the partnership who has\nautism and the other doesn't. And so they're obviously\ngoing to have different ways of communicating or\nprocessing what happened. We all have different perspectives. It really depends on what makes a person feel like it's been repaired? What makes a person feel understood? Does that need to be verbal? Or in the case of that older couple I have where they know they\nunderstand one another because there's a gentleness\ntoward one another after."

      "section": "Why relationships fail",
      "text": "- What are some common\nways relationships fail that you've observed in all\nthe therapy you've done? - Oh, well the Gottman's identified what they call the four\nhorsemen, the apocalypse, so- - Okay, what are the four horsemen? - I mean, I could just keep it simple and go off their research. So those are four different behaviors that they identify in couples or that you can identify in couples that are really highly\npredictive of a divorce. Some more than others, but I'll start with the lower ones. So one thing that we, and by the way, actually, we all do these things, these that would be in that 5 to 1 ratio, you'd wanna stay away from some of these, these are the ones. So as they pile up, now that\nratio's gonna get imbalanced and then you are headed for a split. - Yeah.\n- Okay? So the first is criticism. So criticism is when we have a complaint. Complaints are normal, but instead of owning our own\nproblems, our own feelings, we assume that our perspective is the only valid, accurate perspective. And so we take it upon ourselves to tell our partner what\nis wrong with them, okay? So there's essentially no real belief that they might have a\nvalid perspective too. So this could look like\nyou never help me out with the house. Or even, you're so lazy,\nlike can't I just get you for five seconds to help with the kids? Or something like that. And then what happens is horseman\nnumber two, defensiveness. So not everybody is defensive just because they were criticized. Some people just are more prone to defensiveness than others. None of us really like\nadmitting our faults. So it's pretty natural. But defensiveness is\nessentially making excuses or worse, turning it\naround on your partner, not accepting any responsibility and definitely not validating\nwhat they're feeling. Now if you get criticized enough or if you get really flooded, the flooding is what happens\nwhen our heart rate goes up kind of around 100 beats per minute, our frontal lobe shuts down. That's our thoughtful\nbrain, our logical brain, and our reptilian kind of hind\nbrain takes over our thinking and we just go into fight\nor flight, in a way. We just wanna annihilate our partner instead of say anything\nthat would be helpful to the relationship. So if you're getting flooded,\nyou could do a couple things. You could get super critical,\nyou could get contemptuous, which I'll talk about in a\nsecond, it's the last horseman. Or you do the third horseman,\nwhich is stonewalling. And in their research, the Gottman's found that men are actually\nmore likely to stonewall. I also am someone who\nstonewalls, (laughing) but it's where you just sort of disconnect from the conversation. You shut down, you turn away, you can physically even turn\naway, kind of arms crossed, but you're just, you're shut off. And stonewalling happens\nusually because you get flooded. You feel like you can't win, you don't know what to do to\nmake the situation better. It feels pretty hopeless and\ntalking feels unproductive. So you can see how in a typical\nheterosexual relationship, the gender dynamic, we\nknow that women tend to use criticism more often\nbecause they're the ones that typically raise issues verbally. And then if men are\nfeeling more criticized, that they tend to stonewall. And it becomes this vicious\ncycle of then more criticism, but the criticism is really\njust a plea to be loved and get your partner\nto show you they care. And then the man tends to feel like he can't do anything right,\nthis isn't even productive. If I say anything, I'm\njust gonna make it worse. And they don't have any real, you haven't given them a\nspecific need, a solution, something they can do to shine\nfor you, so they turn away. - And where does the contempt come in? - All right, so contempt\nis criticism on steroids. This is what John Gottman\ncalls sulfuric acid for love. Nothing will erode a relationship\nquicker than contempt. Contempt is when you are\nlooking at your partner from a superior position. So you are eye rolling, you are name calling, there's a mockery, mocking, even physical\nmockery, imitating them, imitating their voice. Contempt is meant to just take the legs out from your partner, make them feel pathetic, ridiculous. And it can be abusive, but most people have engaged in contempt at some point in their relationship. Lower level would be\nsort of the eye rolling. But that is the biggest\npredictor of a split. - If you allow yourself to think, yeah, that mockery or contempt\njust a little bit, it's like this weird slippery slope. - Sure is.\n- And the opposite is true, where I just look at a person and think, wow, isn't that the most\nlike wonderful creature I've ever seen in my life? Like, just think that. And you notice the little\ndetails about who they are and so I just observe them the\nway you observe like a weird, like peacock at a zoo\nor something like that. - [Shannon] Intention\nis powerful, isn't it? - Yeah, and it changes. You start to notice beautiful things and then let the things that annoy you- - Yes.\n- Like just- - You're exactly right. You're touching on-\n- dissipate. - some really important things. So in relationships, we actually know that\nwearing rose-colored glasses is important, it's healthy, we need it. And it's a choice you're making, right? So there is a saying that getting married is just choosing one\nperson's fault over another. And the reality is that\nwe may become infatuated with somebody else. As human beings, love is an emotion, attraction is an emotion. And as you go through life, even if you're in a\ncommitted relationship, you might see beauty in another. And that person who is novel\nmight seem attractive to you. But if you can remember that\nthey too have a set of problems that you would be marrying, it really helps you to see the\nbeauty in your partner again and recognize all of their\nincredible strengths. And all the ways we meld with the person become our own family, almost become, I mean, our lives intertwine\nand we grow those oak trees. - So to you, by the way, it is a line I read somewhere that when you're wearing\nrose-colored glasses, all the red flags looks just like flags. (Shannon laughing) I think is a good-\n- I love that. - It's a good line.\n- I love that. - So you think that\nhumans are fundamentally, all of us are fundamentally\nflawed or have flaws, they're unique flaws. And that basically\nrelationships is just the way to figure out how the\ntwo can fit together. - Right. And we're different. So no matter what, we're\ngoing to have differences. We are raised differently\nthan our partner. We have different stories,\ndifferent experiences that shaped our value systems, especially when it comes to\nthe big ones like parenting, love, money, these principles\nthat are based in our history, we're gonna have differences. So is this a set of differences\nyou can accept from somebody and work with? Do the benefits and do their strengths, do they make it worth it or is it, are they deal breaker differences?"

      "text": "- Tricky question.\n- Sure. - But in the couples you've worked with, is there like the feminine\nand the masculine, is there different dynamics\nthat come into play, like dominance, submissive? Is it like a dance where it just changes from minute to minute? Is there dynamics that you observe that both limit and enable\nsuccessful relationships? - Yes, so there are, if we're talking about masculine/feminine, then how also we could get into, are we talking about actual\ngender, identified gender, or are we just talking about these traits? Because like I said, I stonewall, which is typically in couples, something that is more\nassociated with straight men. But that's my style of coping\nwhen I get overwhelmed. That is not tied to any sort of success or non success of a relationship. But what we do know is that gay couples, so lesbians and gay men tend\nto be gentler with one another when they are having conflict discussions. So that's actually been\nidentified in the research and it's something I've witnessed\nand it's just fascinating. So with my straight couples, I'll be going through one of these, if we're processing the\nconflict that occurred, I'll be going through the sheet. And it's very, very structured because you don't want\ncouples doing more damage when they're there with you. You want them practicing\nskills that protect them from criticism, that\nprotect them from contempt. And when I'm working\nwith a straight couple, I am like a referee, or sometimes I'll relate it\nto being like a ski coach and keeping people on a bunny hill. And you tell them, you let\nthem make like two turns and then you stop them\nand you meet up again because you don't want them to veer off. With straight couples, you are doing very short\nturns before you need to kind of intervene and re-scaffold. I had a lesbian couple recently and they were so lovely with each other. They skipped like seven steps\nto the advanced final portion where they were already\ncoming up with solutions and suggesting things\nthat they might be able to do differently next time to make it better for their partner. They were asking each other questions about how their partner\nfelt, with no agenda, no attempt to sort of be like, \"Well do you think you're\nfeeling that way because,\" which straight couples do all the time. You just see this humility\nand openness. It's lovely. - Yeah, it's lovely. But I wonder if maybe watching\ntoo many Hollywood films, if some of the drama, some of the tension is required for a\npassionate lifelong romance. - No, it's not. And that's great news. So we actually know\nthat the closer you feel to your partner. So if, I mean, you've\ntalked a lot about beauty and you can ignite that\nbeauty, that interest, right? So when you're falling in love, it's usually that a person\nis sort of a mystery to you and you're uncovering these layers that you find really appealing. - Mm-hmm.\n- There are continual layers that you can uncover with\nyour partner over time. I don't think we realize that. I think we get complacent\nand we think we've had every conversation imaginable. What else are they\ngonna do to surprise me? But we don't know the\nquestions to be asking. One of my favorite questions, I like turning these\nconversations kind of into a quiz because I get bored easily. So rather than just asking\nan open-ended question, there's a way you can do\nthis with your partner where it's sort of like the dating game. Like what is my as of yet fondest, but unrealized life dream? And see if your partner knows.\nYou might not even know. They might know you better\nthan you know yourself. That in and of itself\nis a beautiful reminder of the relationship and how special it is. But then also when they say it or when you realize or\nhave to think critically, like what is my husband's\nas of yet unrealized, but fondest life dream? And then you can talk about it. You just, I don't know, you just kind of transcend\ninto this new area and you feel tight again, you\nfeel like, you feel close. - Well you really talk to each other. Like I've recorded and\nwithout intending to publish podcasts like this with\nmicrophones, with friends, with people close to me. Because it is literally that,\nyou get to ask questions like as if it's an interview,\nand we don't do that. - [Shannon] That's exactly it. The way you're talking with me. - Yeah.\n- Sit down with your partner, have that conversation. - Like years later.\n- Right. Show interest, actually be curious. See what they surprise you with. - And actually what you learn is you don't know the answers\nto most of these questions. - [Shannon] 100%. Exactly. - Like what's your favorite\nmovie from the '80s? You might not know the answer to that. It's like those first date\nquestions or whatever. - Or what's your favorite\nmovie this year and why? - [Lex] And why. Yeah, it's fascinating. - Mm-hmm. It is. - It's hard to do that because I think that you'll\nprobably be offended at first how little the other person knows. So I think that you have\nto work through that. - You know, I actually find\nthat there's this rekindling because partners are shocked\nthat their partner does know so much about them. Especially if they've\nbeen feeling dissatisfied or disconnected, it's a reminder of all the\ngood that's still there."

      "text": "- I know we've said some of those things, but what's on the opposite side? What's the key to a\nsuccessful relationship? What are the things you\nsee time and time again that to you designate that\nthey're in a good path? - Yeah, there's a real\nattunement honestly, it's sort of an us\nagainst the world feeling. Neither partner's gonna talk\nshit on them, the other. There's a loyalty. They handle each other in\nthe relationship with care. You can tell that they've\nworked some things. To me, it usually indicates\nthat these are some people who have figured they've\nhad to work some things out. They know that this is delicate. They know, you know,\nthat you're on thin ice, you take a wrong step and you\ncan be back in a tough place in your relationship or\nyou treat it with care and it can be amazing. So they're careful with one another. They give each other compliments.\nThey are considerate. So you'll see, you know, he'll bring the car around\nfor her because it's raining, or she'll bring him home\nsome takeout, you know, she'll order for him\ntoo at the restaurant. They keep each other\nin each other's minds. - But that us against the world thing, that definitely is there. Like if you-\n- 100%. You've seen that, right? - Yeah. You've seen it. And you've seen it like, I like it when couples have\nbeen together for a long time and when one is talking,\nthe other one looks at them. If you don't do that,\nthat's not a bad sign. But it's a good sign when you do that. - Yes.\n- And I think it's actually a really good exercise to do because I enjoy it when I see in others, it's a way to show that you\ndon't take them for granted and that you still find\nthem like this mysterious, wonderful creature to observe. Like, I think too often we\nhave that with our parents, we have that with people close to us. You think, yeah, I've heard\nwhat they're about to say. I know you can complete their sentences. - [Shannon] Yeah, take them for granted. - And then if you just\nlook at them and say, \"Wow, this is the most brilliant person I've ever seen in my life.\" I can't, you know, just\nappreciate every word that comes out of them and\nlook at them in that way, you actually begin to believe it. - Yeah.\n- And you actually begin to see the beauty of what they're saying. - You are exactly right. It's\na self-fulfilling prophecy. - And they-\n- And it's caring. Yeah. - Yeah.\n- It's very caring. So that's, I mean that's, I think the beauty of what the\nGottman research showed us, taught us, provided us is\nthat we can do these things that become cyclic and just\nkeep growing this relationship, making it stronger, more\npowerful, more loving. You would never want to cut it down. - Well you were talking about the sheet for conflict processing.\n- Mm-hmm. - What are we talking about? So like a couple will come and say like there was this conflict\nand you put it on the table and then what does it mean to process it? - Well, so in that\nGottman Method of therapy, there are all these different, I mean 100s of different interventions. And based on what the\nissue is in that session, you can decide the most\nappropriate intervention. And so this is a specific intervention for if it is a conflict that occurred, and there are different\ntypes of conflicts. So this would be more like an incident. It's not a perpetual recurring problem, which has actually a\ndifferent intervention where you kind of look at the underlying belief systems, values. And the goal is not to solve that problem. The goal in that situation\nis to actually just get a better understanding of each other and your positions and just, you stop seeing your\npartner as the adversary and you start seeing them\nas a person who makes sense. But if there's been a specific event, a specific fight that's\njust sort of situational, but it's left bad blood, things were said, or you didn't feel understood, this intervention I was talking about is one that you would go\nthrough a series of steps where first you identify the\nemotions that you were feeling, then you describe play by play your movie, your perspective. If your partner were\nlooking through your eyes, this is what they heard, saw,\nthought, then they saw this, then they heard this. So you're not saying, \"Yeah, then you came in and were\nyelling and acting crazy.\" You're saying, \"So then I saw you come in, I heard you say, and I thought\nto myself, well, great, now everything's ruined,\" right? So you're showing them your movie, then they have to\nsummarize the movie for you and then vice versa. And then there's this step\nwhere each person validates some part that they can understand. Based on what you saw, heard, I can actually understand how you felt one of those feelings that you said. And then my favorite part is\nyou rewind sort of the movie from that day back through into childhood and you land on a time, a memory when you felt a similar set of feelings. And this is like the\nmost beautiful part ever. Because let's say the feeling\nwas I felt misunderstood, I felt misjudged, un-cared about, unloved, like you didn't even like me. And I'll say, \"When did you feel that way? You know, land on a time.\" And they're like, \"My\nwhole childhood, you know, my parents were, my mom\nwas always accusing me of doing things I wasn't doing. And it would set me up and\nmy dad would come home, he'd hear about it, he\nwould just believe her.\" And then you have like a partner\nclimbing up on the couch, like to give their partner a hug while they're sharing the\nstory, it's beautiful. And it changes the way you\ninteract in future disagreements. - [Lex] So you have those moments. - Yeah, you can't unlearn, now you know this about your partner, you know what they're sensitive to. - Yeah, and again, you\nkind of see the beauty and the flaws then.\n- Right. - And you, (chuckling) - [Shannon] It all makes sense, right? - Yeah. It all kind of makes sense. - Yeah, so you maybe were in\nthis dumpster dive in your head of how your partner sucks and all the things that\nare wrong with them and it's so hopeless. And then you get this light\nshining through and you realize, oh my God, of course they\nwould be sensitive to that. And suddenly it's not about all the ways your partner is wrong and\nproving that they're wrong. It's just how can I in\nthe future make sure they do not feel this again? I would never want this person I love to misunderstand me and feel so unloved."

      "text": "- The early days of that, what do you think about the whole dating, modern dating process? How do you find a partner that you can stay with\nfor the rest of your life? - So we are absolutely doing it wrong, but there is a way you can do it. And I am such a fan of this\npsychologist Ty Tashiro. I adore him. He's brilliant, he's lovely. He's also very humble. Just a wonderful salt-of-the-earth guy. I'm gonna tell you a very true story here. - Uh-huh. - Okay?\n- Let's go. - I was in a bad relationship and I was at a psychology conference with my partner at the time. We were both at this conference and we were sitting in a lecture\nhall there for Ty Tashiro to do his talk that day\non his phenomenal research on relationship satisfaction and dating. And I was sitting next to him\nand we had been, you know, it was just always unpleasant on trips. There were always fights. And we're sitting there and\nTy Tashiro starts talking about his research and how he\nfound that most people are, you know, signing this agreement, getting married and doing it\nbased on the love endorphins. And really only about 35%\nof anybody who's married is actually happy. And he said, \"So then, you know- - That's a pretty low number.\n- Exactly. But here's what I love about Ty Tashiro is he didn't stop there. He wanted to know what\nthose people who were happy had in common. And then same thing with\nthe people who were unhappy, he found a couple fascinating patterns. So the couples who were happy\ntended to rate their partners higher in three different traits. And I love talking about this because if you are somebody\nwho can follow instructions, you can find this. I mean, very easily. Those three traits tend to\nbe conscientiousness, okay? And I love the word conscientiousness because it's not just kindness. Kindness is a good way to think of it. But you can be kind and\nkind of be a pushover. And that's not attractive. Conscientiousness is smart, attentive. It's somebody who reads into\na text message and thinks, wow, she was making herself\nvery vulnerable there. That's conscientiousness. - I like how you just\nthrew in a compliment. - No but it's-\n- Appreciate it. - It's true, it's a certain intelligence, awareness and attunement. And then on top of that,\nconscientiousness is motivated. So you can't be on your ass\nall day and be conscientious 'cause then you can't meet the needs that you anticipate about the person. So conscientious is that guy\nwho drives the car around in the rainstorm so his\nwife's hair doesn't get wet. It's my husband who checks\nmy alarm for me every morning 'cause he knows I'm\nterrible at time management and he makes sure that I set\nit a reasonable amount of time before my first meeting and not the 20 minutes I think I need. And then he'll come wake\nme up with a cup of coffee. That is ultimate conscientiousness. And it is true. I mean, I will tell you as somebody who's with\na conscientious partner, your love increases over\ntime as you continue to feel grateful and admiring of that person. The second one, you\nwant somebody who is low in a big five personality\ntrait called neuroticism. You want somebody\nemotionally stable in a way. Now this doesn't mean you can't, I'm somebody who doesn't get the blues or struggle with mental health issues. Trust me, Ty is with\nsomebody who, you know, I'm all over the place. But you want somebody who\nkind of owns their shit and isn't going to just be emotionally unstable all over. You know, you want somebody\nwho is generally happy and has some life satisfaction. Having a partner who has serious,\nnot mental health issues, but unmitigated emotional\ndistress and instability is really hard on the partner. And it's really hard on\nother family members, including children if you have children. So it's just a predictor of happiness. - So there's a certain threshold of chaos that if you exceed it-\n- Well said. - is going to be destructive to a long-term relationship.\n- That is a perfect description. - But then again-\n- Without chaos. Not the mystery chaos you love\nwith your little poet brain. I'm talking more like just somebody who there's just no peace, there's no peace. There's a problem with everything. Everything becomes more difficult. Going to a party is a chore, you don't know if they're gonna\nhave a meltdown at the party or how many complaints about your friends or everything is a problem. So you want somebody who\nhas just some resiliency, I think is a good term\nfor it, some flexibility. - [Lex] Some spice is\nokay, but not too much, like the-\n- Right. Flexibility, resiliency, easygoing, okay? The third-\n- Yeah. - is really interesting I think. So he found that having a partner with sort of moderate adventurousness, not high adventurousness, actually leads to greater satisfaction. And the reason for that\nis high adventurousness equals novelty seeking. - Wow.\n- Shiny new things. And so if you're in a\nmonogamous relationship, if that is what's important to you, it's going to be very hard for a partner who is novelty seeking to be faithful. So that will cause a lot of pain. But also novelty-seeking people tend to always have new\nprojects, new interesting things. And so their attention is drawn\naway from the relationship. And so you can just feel pretty\nneglected or unimportant. - By a little bit. - But you want a little\nbit of adventurousness. So you want your person to\nbe sort of self-motivated, individuated, have their own interests, not completely dependent\non you, but also, I mean, low adventurousness is not a bad thing. Ultimately what you're getting with low to moderate\nadventurousness is that rock, that feeling of stability, that home. And I made some references earlier, like when you're 70 and\nyou turn to your partner, do you want him to be hot or, you know? For instance, my dad\nhas dementia right now and my husband turned to me on the plane, we were all coming back from a trip and where we really saw\nhow severe it's getting. And he just turned to me, he\nknew how much pain I was in, even though I wasn't showing it. And he said, \"I want you to\nknow that if it comes to a point where we need to take care of your dad, he needs to live with us,\nyou don't even need to ask. I am 100% on board and will help.\" And those are the things that\nmatter, that home feeling. And technically that's\na trait that's usually, that's sort of a, my husband caring so much\nabout family and home and taking care of things that matter, those are things that\ntend to be associated with that low to moderate adventurousness, somebody who really cares\nabout simple things and family. - I wonder if those three things are something you can work on. You know, conscientiousness,\nyou can probably- - You can.\n- Proactively observe yourself and, you know, do it more regularly. - Right.\n- Neuroticism might be the hardest one probably to control.\n- I think so. Well no, I mean, I was pretty neurotic in my early 20s. - And when you wake up to it, maybe you, if you're self-aware about it, maybe you'll be able to control it. - Yeah, I think self-awareness is key. I think that's why I love therapy so much. I think life is about growth\nand our potential for growth and to make our own lives better, to make the lives of others better, to serve others, to heal. All of us are this collective healing, and I think we're all capable of growth. - And the same with adventurousness. I'm somebody that's\npretty low an adventure, but I keep throwing myself out there just for the extra adventures,\nso you can grow in that way. - Yes, and I am high in adventurousness and I was not really ready to settle down. I was married earlier in my 20s. But I would say that I\nam much more prepared to be in a committed\nlong-term relationship now in my 40s than I was when I was younger. - But in that same way, for me, I like to connect myself\nto high adventure people so that it, like, brings me out. It's like they're a horse\nand I get to ride them or something.\n- Yeah. And that's the thing. So high adventure people are attractive, they're interesting, exciting. But it can be a world of\nheartbreak because, you know, you're only under that\nspotlight for a few minutes and then they're onto\nthe next shiny thing. - Yeah, but heartbreak is part of love. But that might be the drug thing that you were talking about."

      "section": "Sex",
      "text": "Speaking of adventurousness,\nwhat about sex? What role-\n- Oh, sex is important. - does sex play in a\nsuccessful relationship? - Well it, okay, so I'm\nsaying it's important, but I wanna qualify that. Everybody has different levels of sex that are satisfying to them. Sex can definitely bond\nyou to your partner. Orgasms are amazing. They de-stress us. They're healthy. I mean you can have an orgasm and have a lower level\nof stress for 48 hours. I think that's pretty incredible. If you have, I mean, just\nthat kind of physical contact with your partner, even a\n20-second hug with your partner has similar benefits to an orgasm. You're gonna have a lower stress level. You're gonna feel immediately\ncloser to your partner. You're gonna get a rush of oxytocin, which is gonna make you feel happier, more grounded throughout the day. So that's a 20-second hug. You extrapolate that to sex\nand things are gonna be great. - Mm-hmm. So it's just physiological? - Mm-hmm.\n- But I wonder, there's probably metrics\nabout how often you have sex, how that correlates to successful\nrelationships and so on. - Well there are, but it\nreally has more to do, it's sort of like, remember\nI was talking about processing conflict and what matters is do people feel like it's been resolved? Do they feel like there's been a repair? Not necessarily how they go\nabout doing it. Same with sex. Does each partner feel sexually satisfied? So that could be once\na month for one couple, it could be five times a\nweek for another couple. It could be never for\nother couples, truly. I mean, so sex has a ton of benefits, but its absence isn't\nnecessarily detrimental, I guess, would be the qualifier\ndepending on who you are. - And I know couples that use sex as part of the conflict\nresolution process. - It's hugely effective for that. If it works for both parties. All parties. - That's true.\n- Not just both. All. - That's true."

      "section": "Cheating",
      "text": "What do you think about infidelity? You know, what's the cause of infidelity? Why do men and women cheat? - It's different for\neverybody, but I mean, even earlier I was saying\nwith adventurousness, like if monogamy is\nsomething you're doing, I've seen in my own practice, I've seen the entire range of couples who are open about having\nsexual relationships with other people and fine with it. Couples who wanna be fine with\nit, but find out they're not. Couples who aren't just couples. Couples with multiple people, you know, multiple romantic relationships. I've had couples where\naffairs are tolerated and not talked about, they're not enjoyed, but they are not the type of betrayal that will destroy the relationship. Sort of a understanding\nand keep it outta my face. And then also we won't talk about it. - So an affair that happened without getting permission first, and as long as you don't talk about it, it's not going to do a\ndamage to the relationship? - Right, but we can't even\ntalk about it like that, right? - Okay.\n- So nobody's going to admit that the affair is happening. There can't be any evidence of it. It's sort of a just look the\nother way type of a situation. But the partner who is not\nhaving the affair, right, they typically know. They certainly know that their\npartner is capable of that. They just kind of know, but they don't want it in their face. It would become a problem\nif it was in their face. As long as certain needs are met and everything else is okay at home, it's just one of those things\nwhere don't ask, don't tell. - Well, that's an interesting point 'cause I had a bunch of\narguments with people. I tend to hang out with,\nespecially in the tech sector, people who really value like\nhonesty and radical honesty. And I keep arguing with\npeople about this because to me, it's not that simple. Like that's an example right there that honesty can be really destructive. Like, honesty is also a\nreally complicated thing to get to the bottom of,\n'cause what is really honest? - Yes.\n- And, you know, like how do I look in this dress? Like, there's a million ways- - It's perspective.\n- to answer that. - Yeah.\n- Perspective. A lot of-\n- It can be cesspool in my mind if I'm in a bad place or my partner and I haven't, like if Ty and I haven't\nbeen connected lately, my honesty of what I\nactually think about him would be horrifically damaging and completely unfounded also. And it can change on a dime. - [Lex] But that's also not actual honesty to the big picture of how you feel about him.\n- Right. - I have interacted with a few folks who talk about their previous\nsexual partners, for example, the numbers of sexual partners they've had and they feel like that kind of honesty is actually empowering and\nenriching to the relationship because all the sexual\nexperiences you've had in the past make you a better sexual partner, better partner in the present. And to me, from the\nculture I've come from, that's like anti-romantic. - Yep. Yep.\n- Like I, you kind of throw the past kind of away, you don't really talk about it. It's kind of there in\nthis amorphous shape, but it's almost as if you've\nmet together for the first time and this is a beautiful new thing, like you're creatures that have woken up from a long slumber. - Right, you're starting anew. - Yeah, starting anew.\n- Right. And you want some mystery there. - Right, I think the mystery and like you have to figure\nthat out about each other. So I'm not exactly sure\nthat honesty is always- - It's not for everyone. And then also is honesty harmful or helpful at certain points too? - Yeah.\n- So you're talking about sort of like disclosing\nprior sexual history? - Yeah.\n- I thought you were going to go to, so if you've had an affair, do you keep that under your hand? - [Lex] Oh, yeah, that's\na really tough question. - Or are you obligated to disclose it? - [Lex] It's a really, that's very- - It's a very tough question. Very tough. - Well, what do you think is the answer? - I have my own personal beliefs. I also then like I have\nmy therapeutic beliefs. I think frankly, and this\nis just me as a human being, not Shannon the psychologist. I believe that if you have\nfucked up, and I, again, I'm coming from a framework\nright now of monogamy. If you are committed to somebody you love and you have fucked up, you don't get to shed\nyour guilt onto them. You need to carry that burden. It's not necessarily,\nI think it's simplistic and unsophisticated to be like, \"But then you're being dishonest.\" I think it's actually selfish\nto unload it on somebody else and give them the trauma of imagining. What we do know about\ninfidelity is that it can create an actual post-traumatic\nstress like experience for the betrayed partner\nwhere they are having intrusive thoughts about it. Those are unwanted thoughts\nand it's uncontrolled. It comes in at multiple times a day. They'll have depressed mood, they'll have nightmares about it. Their entire sense of security, safety, self-esteem gets shattered\nbecause of your actions. I think it's kind of, yeah,\nmoralistic and naive to think well they deserve to know the truth, if you actually know the harm that that sort of betrayal does. Especially if you truly\nmean to stop it, right? - Mm-hmm.\n- So if it was a one and done or if it\nhappened and you've stopped it and you do not intend\nto do it again, frankly, I think you live with that burden. You live with that discomfort. - Thank you for saying that\n'cause I totally agree, but it's like logically it's doesn't quite make sense to give that advice, but psychologically makes complete sense because you really are\ndestroying another person's mind. Their faith in love, in relationships, their trust, everything. And then you're imprisoning\nthem to be stuck with you for months or years if you're\ntrying to work through it, through that torture. So you should be carrying that burden of working through it, I think. Why do you say that that's\nyour personal opinion versus your therapeutic,\nlike what therapeutic- - Well I think everybody\nhas different values. So I think that's a value-based decision because to me, the hierarchy\nis kindness and do no, like do no further harm. Over in that case, over truth, right? - Yeah.\n- Whereas other people, you know, my husband for instance, he is like truth above all else. You don't get to decide\nwhat I know or, you know, you don't get to decide whether or not I can handle that knowledge. So he would even see my determination of, you know, that I should carry\nthe burden sort of arrogant, like, well why don't you\nlet your partner decide whether or not they, you know,\nwhy do you get to choose? I don't know. I think there's\nvalue to both arguments. I absolutely see his point. - [Lex] It's fascinating.\nIt's fascinating. - I absolutely see his point. And his, I think, is like a\nvery humble sort of option, like, you don't get to\nchoose what's better, you just need to give them the information and they can choose. But I think, I don't know,\nI think it's kinder to hold. I think it's going to cause\nyour conscience more discomfort to hold it. And I think there's sort\nof a cleansing we do when we share that information. I think in real life\nmost people disclose it because they can't stand the\nsecret anymore themselves. That, to me, is a selfish act. - And with unemployment\napplications and so on. And just with friends would ask people, \"What do you care more\nabout truth or loyalty?\" Just to get to see how they think about those different questions. And yeah, I was surprised how much variance there is on that. - And also conceptually, I bet, conceptually I don't think we\nactually know where we stand until we're faced with\na situation like that. - Yeah, I think people, a lot of people, especially when they're younger, say especially if they're\nkind of intellectual, they'll say, \"Truth above all else.\" - Yeah.\n- It's like, all right. - [Shannon] You're exactly right. - All right. (both laughing) Until-\n- It's a platitude. - Until you get to hear a\ntruth that truly breaks you, that truly hurts you, it\ncauses suffering to you. And then you realize or a\ntruth you give to somebody else will cause them suffering. And then you get to see that\nsuffering destroy their life and maybe your relationship and so on. And then you're like, \"Oh.\" - Yeah, like should I\nsit my dad down right now and be like, \"Dad, your dementia, like you have dementia again today, I'm gonna tell you, you have... Dad, you're not making sense.\" No, it's not going to be discussed. We're gonna make him comfortable. And I mean, yeah, I think\nit truth can be a little bit of a platitude sometimes. - Some of those complexities\nare all the things involved in the challenges of what makes\na relationship work, right? - Mm-hmm.\n- What do you think"

My worldview is such that I see the beauty and value in monogamous\nrelationships just for me, but I'm also open to the possibility of what works for other people. Have you done any kind\nof work with the people in open relationships? - As clients or research? - As clients?\n- Oh yeah. Yeah. - Is there some interesting differences between open relationships\nand monogamous relationships? - You know, I think that\nmay have been actually what was behind my question\nabout the satisfaction with them being on the extremes. My hypothesis essentially\nwas is that because they, if you are really all in, you've worked out some of the kinks. I think I've seen couples who are trying it out, like for the first time, it\ntends to get a little haywire. There's some excitement in the beginning. Everybody's really excited about it. I think the philosophy makes\nsense to a lot of people. The science of it makes\nsense to a lot of people. But we have been raised in a society that is pretty monogamous, so there isn't a lot of\nscaffolding around it. And there's a lot of\ninner conflict, I think, for people to go away from the values that they've been taught\nsince they were kids. And so jealousy arises a lot. And also, it's very difficult to be, I think, as truthful and\ndirect as you need to be, which you're describing in\nthese polyamorous situations where everybody is laid out on the table. So I think that's something\nthat may be practiced. In my own work with\nclients, I've just noticed that the partners who are happier in these situations, who I've worked with, they\nare more experienced at it. - Yeah.\n- They seem to have it down."

      "text": "- You testified in the Johnny\nDepp/Amber Heard trial, based on your role as a clinical\nand forensic psychologist. It was watched by, I don't\nknow how many people, maybe tens, maybe hundreds\nof millions of people. What was that experience like? - Thank God I didn't\nknow that at the time. - Were you scared?\n- Oh yeah. - Given the size of the platform, how many people are watching?\n- Well, scared typically isn't the word when I testify, I'm always excited and\na little trepidatious before I testify because\nthe stakes are so high for everybody's life in that room. This was different. Anxiety isn't usually my brand. And I just skipped anxiety that morning and went straight to terror. And I was mad. I was\nmad at the legal team. I was funny, like I was having\nall these strong emotions. I couldn't find my bobby pins. I almost started crying\n'cause I couldn't find them. I was pretty unhinged that morning, and in a way that was\nreally unfamiliar to me. And it was right when I cried 'cause I couldn't find my bobby pins, that I realized I needed to get a grip and that I was a professional\nand that my hair didn't matter even though it ended up mattering. People noticed that it was crazy. But I got a grip and I went\nin and I just did my job. - So the terror in the\nend helped you focus and do your job well? - I think it does and it's\na little scary, though, 'cause I know what fear does cognitively and there is a sweet spot\nwhere you want some stress and then you can be really\nacutely focused and attuned. But then if you go over this threshold, you get sort of that frontal lobe shutdown where you're not thinking clearly. And everybody knows that experience from taking a really\nstressful test at some point, like in high school. And then they're going over\nthe answers with the teacher in class later and they're like, \"How did I miss that\nquestion? I know that.\" You're just in a different state. That's when you have too much stress. I think this day I actually was bordering on too much stress, if not\nclearly in that threshold. But once you're sitting\nthere for a little bit and you're asked the questions, you can kind of go into a routine of just wanting to talk about your work. - So what is the work, the job of a forensic\npsychologist in that context? - In the Depp/Heard trial, I was serving as an expert witness based on a psychological\nevaluation of one of the parties. So forensic psychologists\ncan serve the court or in legal matters in a number of ways. They can act as a confidential consultant for an attorney on a case, or they can even assist\nwith jury selection. They might testify without\ndoing an evaluation if they're just coming to testify about sort of a subject matter. And then they wouldn't be\nanswering specific questions to either of the parties, but just talking more\nhypothetically about a field area. In this case, because I was ordered to\nconduct an evaluation, I evaluated one of the parties and then you provide a report to the court with your findings and then you testify as to what your findings were. - But from my perspective,\njust watching you, you seem to have held\nit together really well. So what do you attribute that to? So you said like it calmed\ndown after you were able to ask the question. So to me, if I were just to\nput myself in your place, it seems like the internet and the world would be very nitpicky\nabout individual words. You're speaking from a place of scientific rigor. And so you have to be very\nprecise with your wording. - Very precise.\n- I would feel like so much pressure about\neach single word I choose. Did you feel that pressure that you had to be extremely\nprecise with the words? - Always. The pressure is so high\ngoing into testifying. I think that's where I feel\nthe most pressure is preparing, and literally the moment until\nI start having to answer. And then I don't even have the luxury of thinking about myself because it is so important\nthat that answer be clarified and understandable to the court, that that becomes my focus. And that's the godsend, is\nthat I can stop thinking about how scary it all is, because I need to pay attention\nto explaining something. - So if it's okay, I\nwould love to talk to you about the Personality Assessment test. 'Cause I think it's\nactually super fascinating. - The Personality Assessment\nInventory or the MMPI-2? You're probably referring to the MMPI-2, which is one I talked a lot about. - MMPI-2. Yeah. So maybe can you explain the\nMMPI-2, seems fascinating. - It is.\n- It has like its output, the results has some basic\nskills as code types. And just reading through the different- - It's so complex. It's a thing of beauty. - Because the human mind\nis really complicated. Even, you know, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, like all of these things are really complicated. There's like, many of them\nwe don't understand well. There seems to be a\nhuge amount of variance, and yet you have to be\nable to stitch together a bunch of characteristics\nthat give you intuition about the unique aspects of each person. You want to be able to have tests that get you closer to identifying the peculiar flaws or\nbeauties of a particular mind. So this seems to do a good job. Just reading through the different- - Can I borrow that-\n- Descriptions of the code- - next time I testify? That was the best description. - I don't know I'm being\npoetic. I apologize. - But\n- No, that was a beautiful description. - You have to be in part\npoetic about the human mind. It's not math, it's psychology. Okay. So what is the MMPI-2? Like, what are we talking about here? Like, it's a questionnaire? - Yes. That's a great start. So it is a questionnaire,\nyet 567 yes/no questions. I'm gonna tell you what's most\nbeautiful about this test. So they used an empirical\nkeying method to develop it. What that means is that they didn't have a bunch of psychologists\nget together and say, \"Let's ask them, let's make\nsure that we identify people who have somatic complaints\nor physical complaints by asking them questions about\nlike numbness in their hand,\" nothing like that. What they did instead\nwas they threw, you know, like take 1,000 questions\nat a group of people who they know had a certain mental illness and a group of people who\ndidn't have that mental illness. And then they looked for patterns in what the people with\nmental illness endorsed as yes and no of those random questions. So it would be, for instance, there's a bronze light\nfixture right there. One of the questions out\nof the 1,000 might be, \"I like light fixtures that\nare bronze. True or false?\" And they looked for correlations in the way that people would answer to these completely innocuous,\njust boring questions. So there was no real way that a test taker could foresee the point of answering. - And so because they can't foresee, it's very difficult to cheat to get to a conclusion they want? - Very difficult, and not only that, but you can imagine using that approach, you can then look for patterns for almost any type of response style, for any type of personality trait, any type of mental illness. You just get a comparison group and then a group who's\nusing that specific strategy or has that specific mental illness or has that personality trait, and you just look for patterns. - And there's a scale\noutput of different kinds? - So-\n- And there's code types? - Yep, so you've got validity scales and those are just fascinating and often one of the most useful parts of this test in forensic context because they show you how a person is approaching the test, how they're answering\nquestions about themselves. So for instance, you can\nsee if they are tired, you can see if they're kind\nof responding randomly. You can see if they are in\nan unsophisticated manner trying to make themselves look\nperfect but not very nuanced. You can see if they may\nbe deceiving themselves and truly believe that they are perfect, whereas others don't see it that way. You can see if they're exaggerating. You can see if they're\nexaggerating because they're truly, it's a cry for help. They are in extreme distress, but they feel as though they\nneed to really punctuate it to get people to notice. Or you can see if they're\nexaggerating in a way that is, you know, driven for\na specific outcome or gain. It's just fascinating and it's the most well-developed\nassessment we have for a person's approach to answering questions about themselves. - So it gives you the context about- - [Shannon] How honest they're being. - the state of the person\nas they're answering them. - Yeah, yeah. Their honesty, how\nforthcoming they're being and how accurate they're being. - And then the result\nof the classification based on the tests are these code types? - Right, well, so you have\nthese clinical scales as well. You have 10 clinical scales that look for different kind of primary\nclinical pathology issues. This test doesn't tell you\nanything good about yourself. At best, it just tells you that you're not responding\nin a way that is dishonest and that you are kind,\nnot hugely problematic, but there's, you know, it's\nnot looking for strengths. So you have these 10 clinical scales that look for variations above the mean of the population in certain areas. Anywhere from, you know,\ndepressive symptoms, manic symptoms, physical complaints, anxiety, nervousness,\naggression, social engagement, a whole scope of human experience. And then there're much more\nnuanced scales from those. So little subscales. And then the real power,\nthough, of the MMPI-2 is in, as you said, these code types. And these code types\nare additional patterns that have been detected that\nreally can be more defining of a personality. So you look for peaks. There can be either two extreme\npeaks or three, typically, that make a code type. And those peaks are higher scores on these personality traits. And specific code types can\ngive you a very nuanced picture of a person's general approach to life and their personal relationships,\njust their personality. - So you can build on\ntop of those code types an understanding, yeah, of how that person's going to deal with different kinds of situation. And then there's, by the\nway, a lot of code types. - [Shannon] There are a lot of code types.\n- I was looking at them, they're pretty interesting. - It is truly fascinating.\n- I wanna take this test. I wanted to see which one I would. - [Shannon] I have given it\nto some people in my life. It's just phenomenal. - How hard is it on your side\nof the table to give the test? - Oh, it's easy. You just proctor, you just\nmake sure that somebody, there's no distraction,\nthat they're well rested. They are sitting there\nand they can just take it in front of you. - So I guess the question is, because the questions are well designed in that it's hard to mess with them. You just give the- - It's very hard to beat it.\nYou just hand it to them. - [Lex] And it's yes and no? - It's yes and no. - [Lex] Okay. - But I should also add\nto this, that this test, as much as I love it and\nit is the most researched and widely used personality\nassessment in the world, it is not in and of itself definitive. So you use it like you already\nhave sort of a hypothesis and you use this for clarification. And it has a ton of value for\nshowing somebody's response or their approach, how\nforthcoming they're being. But other than that, you\nreally need to consider it as a piece of the puzzle. You had said stitch together earlier, and that was just one\nof those points you made that was perfect for describing this. - There's probably no\none perfect test, right? For personality.\n- No. - I wonder there, especially\nwith advancements of AI, there could be more, more and more sophisticated\nways of measuring, of collecting data about your behavior. - [Shannon] Absolutely. There could be. - And being able to measure some kind of more productive kind of, especially not in a forensic context, but more in a trying to figure out like how to improve your lifestyle, improve your relationships,\nall that kind of stuff. So the results of the\ntest with Amber Heard, if you can speak to the public stuff. You said that the results\nof Ms. Heard's evaluation supported two diagnoses, borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. Can you speak to each one\nof those? What are they? What are the basic characteristics of borderline personality disorder? - Sure, well, so right now, the DSM-5, which is sort of the Bible\nfor mental disorders, it's what we go to, our Diagnostic Manual. It classifies personality\ndisorders according to clusters. And Cluster B is one that\ninvolves the emotionally erratic, interpersonally erratic\nemotional disorders. And those include histrionic\npersonality disorder, borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. Eventually, there's been\nsome research on this and a lot of support\nfor us eventually moving into a more spectrum-type approach to considering personality disorders where you'd essentially\nbe looking at dysfunction in different domains of\nsomebody's functioning that has persisted over time. And again, the really important part is, it seems to be a stable trait\npart of their personality. That person, you know, it's in their interpersonal relationships, it's in how they handle their own life, their own functioning, their mood. And it's not just situation\nbased. It seems to be all areas. I don't love the title\nhistrionic personality disorder. I think its history is, it's pretty controversial and\nthere's some misogyny in it. But that all being said, as a servant to the court\nand somebody who is there to just provide the\nscience as it exists today, my job is to relay. And in this specific case,\nI was ordered to provide my diagnostic impressions, a diagnosis. And I don't get to decide which diagnosis, whether I like a certain diagnosis or not. Ultimately if the criteria are\nmet, that diagnosis is given. So as we have it right now with the current personality\ndisorder categories, histrionic personality disorder is probably the most controversial. Some people believe that it is narcissistic personality disorder light. So sort of a less obvious, less malicious version of\nnarcissistic personality disorder. And I think that will\nprobably get sussed out if we do move to a more\nspectrum-based approach 'cause then you would be describing sort of a personality disorder and then you would add the traits to it. So, you know, with issues\nin interpersonal functioning and et cetera. So you could be a little bit more specific rather than having to just\nput somebody in a category. - So that's where things\nare moving, you're saying? - That's where things-\n- Things are kinda clustering. - [Shannon] are moving. - From clusters based\nview of NPD, antisocial personality disorder-\n- To more of a spectrum with personality dysfunction, then you list the traits that are there and I think that'll be more accurate. Especially there's so much overlap between these personality\ndisorders right now, especially Cluster B, it is not uncommon for\npeople to have two or three personality disorders to meet criteria for two or three at the same time. So speaking about borderline\npersonality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. Borderline personality\ndisorder can best be thought of as a disorder of instability\nand impulsiveness, emotional instability, instability in a person's\nself-identity, sense of self. Instability in a person's relationships. And then underlying all of this is an intense fear of abandonment. Histrionic personality\ndisorder is more of a disorder of emotionality, dramatics\nand attention seeking. This, you know, histrionic disorder typically is known for the dramatics. And people who are observing\nor interacting with somebody with this disorder may\neven feel themselves almost kind of wanting to turn away. There's a sense of play acting\nas the person is speaking or engaging with you. Something just feels a\nlittle bit disingenuous and a lot of attention seeking. Similar to borderline\npersonality disorder, you might see with histrionic\npersonality disorder attempts to manipulate. However, the motivation with\nhistrionic personality disorder is that attention, whereas with borderline\npersonality disorder, the underlying motivation\nfor almost everything is to avoid abandonment. So you'll see frantic\nattempts to avoid abandonment, frantic attempts to keep people close. And those frantic attempts\ncan be really harmful to the person and to others. - To the person themselves?\n- Mm-hmm. - (sighs) So the fear of abandonment can result in the very\nthing you're afraid of. - Right, and there has\nbeen some research also to suggest that borderline\npersonality disorder has different types as well. And I think this is really\nimportant because in my own work, I have encountered many people with borderline personality\ndisorder, in my own life, right? And there are different types, right? I'm thinking specifically\nof a girl I really love who I've worked with for years, who is so self-aware\nabout this and endearing and she owns her shit. I can forgive almost anything if somebody just owns their shit. She might lose her temper,\nshe might lash out. She can be erratic, but she\nwill come back and apologize, own it and accept full responsibility. And not only that, but\nidentify it and make changes. She doesn't want to be harmful. I adore that about her. I think it's an admirable\nquality more of us could have. That's very different than\nwhen you think about it, there are nine different symptoms and you only need five to meet criteria. So depending on which symptoms you have, you might be far more calculated,\nconniving, manipulative, or you may just be more of the impulsive, kind of messy, emotionally erratic type. And so there's some new\nresearch also coming out that's even suggested that among women, those that score higher in some of these more calculated traits of\nthe disorder may actually be, it may be a certain presentation\nof female psychopathy. Yeah.\n- Are some of these personality disorders, again, probably impossible\nquestion to answer, but how much of it is nature,\nhow much of it is nurture, or how much of it is in the genetics and you just can't do much with? Maybe another question, a\ndifferent way to ask that is how much can you help that? How much can you become better? - That is a tough question. So there's been a ton of change in the way we've thought\nabout the etiology of these personality disorders. Specific to borderline\npersonality disorder, I think in general the\nview is that most people believe that it was\nassociated with neglect or trauma in childhood. While there is a correlation there, there's a correlation between that and many mental health issues, not just borderline personality disorder. We also, there is evidence to support a genetic basis for this\npersonality disorder. And there are people who have borderline personality disorders that report no childhood\ntrauma or difficulty. And I have seen, you know, sometimes things just happen,\nso I think it's a mix. I think we need to think\nof it as bio-psychosocial, which is generally the\nanswer to most things when you're talking about how a mental health issue comes to be. I certainly think that in most cases, and here's just me\nspeaking personally, again. I think in my own work, in most cases what I see\nis that somebody may have some sort of predisposition, then they go through certain life events and learn patterns of behaving\nthat may serve them well as a child in a dysfunctional situation, but end up being very\nproblematic later on. Or they just have enough\nhardship that that gene, whatever it was lying dormant, that little borderline\npersonality disorder gene expresses itself. And you'll see that with\nthings like schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders. There tend to be certain ages where you'll just see\n(imitates bomb exploding) that expression happen. - All right, for the\nrecord, it got cold in here. So we upgraded with a blanket. (both laughing) You look cozy. Just as a question for me,\njust observing the trial, it was interesting that first of all it was a really raw and honest exploration of a intimate relationship\nbetween two people. - Oh yeah.\n- It was interesting to watch, I suppose I haven't\nwatched that kind of thing. It made me think about what\nmakes for a good relationship, all the many things we've\nalready talked about in this conversation. It was useful for that. But also there was raw recordings of two humans' interaction. What'd you think about that,\nthat there's recordings? It's kind of interesting. - The act of recording your partner? - Yeah, not the ethics of that or so on, but the fact that you have this data. It made me wonder, like if I recorded myself,\nhow would I sound like? - [Shannon] Well, you do record yourself. - No, but here with microphones. But when you're in private.\n- Yeah. - You wonder, like I had a bit of a fight\nwith a friend last week and I wondered which one\nof us was the asshole. I would love to hear the recording 'cause we were a little bit, I think we were a little\nbit rude to each other. And I wonder how it went wrong. What-\n- I love that you asked yourself that\nquestion, that's so useful. - We made up the next day and we, I think both agreed to\nnot ever talk about it, (both laughing) but I want the data. - Just bury it deep.\n- Yeah. - You know, I record my couple sessions and one of the primary purposes\nof that is so that after, if they start to get nasty\nwith each other in the session, I can stop it and I can\nsay, \"What was that,\" right? And most of the time that\nwhat you're describing is so useful because\nwe don't see ourselves, we have no idea that we\njust came off as critical. We think we're being completely\nreasonable and thoughtful. You know, whenever somebody is\nsort of retelling an argument they got in, they said,\n\"And then, you know, I was just caring and just asked, I mean, why, is there a reason you did?\" You know, something like that. If they can actually see\nthemselves, they realize, no, their jaw was clenched,\ntheir voice was raised. They actually called a name.\nSometimes they're shocked. - So just a quick, just to linger on it, you labeled Amber Heard\nas a 3-6 code type. Going back to our discussion,\nwhich can mean that quote, \"She's heavily concerned with image, prone to treating others with cruelty, unable to admit\nresponsibility for wrongdoing and prone to externalizing blame.\" And then I also went into the MMPI-2 list. 3-6 includes anxiety, tension, rigidity, fear of criticism,\nsuppressed hostility, merging in passive or episodic aggression, suspiciousness, egocentricity, what else? Projection. What can you say about that\ncode that it's not captured in the different personality disorders? What are we supposed to do that from a forensic psychology perspective? And what are we supposed\nto do that in general, forget the 3-6, in general, these kinds of code types in that context, in the context of a trial? - If I'm understanding you correctly, it's sort of what's the\npoint of these code types? - Yeah. Thank you for\nasking the question better. I don't know what I'm\ndoing. I'll just sit. I just actually honestly\nreally find MMPI-2 fascinating. - I love that you do. I love that you get it because I just, to me it's such a, it's almost unbelievable\nthat humans created it. But I think that goes back\nto that empirical key method of creating something\nthat enabled it to be as robust as it is, and\nsomething that is very difficult to beat, if not impossible. But the code types\nreally, so it depends on, in any forensic case, what really matters is\nthe psycho legal question. So what is the legal question? And then what is the\npsychologist's responsibility in assisting with whatever\nquestion they're being asked? And there's some\nquestions we can't answer, some that we can. You don't always need\nto provide a diagnosis when you're asked to provide a report. It depends on the jurisdiction,\nit depends on the statute. Some jurisdictions actually\nrequire a diagnosis. In this case, I was asked\nto provide a diagnosis. So when I'm considering a diagnosis, you're integrating\nmultiple different sources of information. You're integrating an\nexaminee's self-report, you are adding collateral data, usually. I wasn't able to obtain collateral\ninterviews in this case. And that was the decision of the court. They said no collateral interviews, but typically, that would be\nsomething that you would add. You're looking at records,\nideally from birth up until the date that the\nalleged injury occurred. And I'm speaking now specifically to a personal injury evaluation where something, where\nsomebody is claiming that they were harmed psychologically. But you want as many records as possible to show how a person functioned\nbefore that event occurred and how they functioned after. And you want it to show\nfinancial functioning, physical functioning,\nacademic functioning. Basically, where is there evidence that something in their life changed? Where is there evidence that harm occurred other than from what they're telling you? And in addition to all of those records that you're reviewing, in\naddition to their self-report, then you're also going to\ngive some of these tests like the MMPI. So the code types are really\nthat strength of the MMPI-2, it gives you really nuanced information about a person's personality. Now again, you're not gonna use the MMPI-2 or any other test by itself to diagnose someone or, you know, decide that the person\nis telling the truth, not telling the truth. It is just another piece of data. And when it's working\nthe way it's supposed to, it lines up really nicely with all of the other data you're getting, including what you've\nobserved from the person during your interview with them, the information they're giving you or inconsistencies with the\ninformation they're giving you, the consistency or inconsistency\nof their self-report from the records, what the\nrecords themselves say, et cetera, et cetera. - So it's adding, it's helping\nyou clarify and clarify and clarify the picture you have of the person.\n- Yep, just dialing it down more and more. You're just making sure that\nit is as accurate as possible."

      "text": "- Okay, so given how huge this trial was, given how eloquent you were, I know you don't think of it that way, but from a public perspective, you are like the star\nbecause of how well you did. - That's insane.\n- It's, I mean, you know? - I'm pretty sure Camille's the star. - Camille's also incredible. I've gotten a chance to interact with her. She's somebody that really inspires me by how good she's at her job,\nhow much she loves her job, and how much the fame,\nthe money, whatever, has not affected the basic\ncore integrity of who she is as a human being, so\nshe's also incredible. Okay, what's the takeaway for\nyou personally from the trial? How has it made you a better person? How's it changing, changed or solidified who you are as a psychologist, as a forensic psychologist,\nclinical psychologist and so on? - Wow, I mean a lot happened\nin my life around that trial, leading up to the trial, after the trial. So let's tackle forensic\npsychologists first. - Sure.\n- Okay. So in terms of forensic psychology, I am grateful to that trial for really strengthening my abilities. The stakes were so high\nthat I took, you know, I was retained about two\nyears prior to the trial. So I really delved deep\ninto the academic side of forensic psychology and making sure that I was adhering as closely as possible to standard practices, best\npractice recommendations for this specific type of an examination. It was intellectually\nawesome and challenging. I felt like my brain was\non fire for a full year leading up to the trial, and\nthat can be really, really fun. It was just challenging. But I am really proud of the work I did. I think the stakes were really\nhigh. It's serious work. It's important that it's\ndone well and accurately, and I felt really good about it. - So have some of those\nlessons carried through to your practice now to both research and some of the things you're doing in terms of helping couples? - No, I mean, as you know, my practice hasn't changed that much. This was more just\nsomething that was more, it demanded so much more of my time than my typical forensic work does. And personal injury cases, or in cases where there\nis an allegation of trauma or psychological harm tend\nto be super labor intensive. This, given the magnitude and how long it had been going\non and the back and forth, required a ton of work\nbefore the trial as well. So it pulled me away from the practice. I think it's been nice to\ngo back a bit if, okay, so now personally, I've\nlearned some things. I've learned that I need\nto slow down a little bit. - So this took a lot from you? - It took a lot. But it\nwas really the culmination. I feel like there are\nthese hoops we jump through again and again, you know, academic challenges\nthat we continue to meet and then there's a next one\nand a next one and a next one. And in the beginning, like when\nyou're getting into college or applying to grad schools, you don't really realize this is going to be a never ending thing. Especially if I continue with research. Forensic work, I love it\nbecause it is so academic. You know, you're writing\nthese 75-page reports and with citations and\nyou have to be accurate. It feels like a doing giant board exams again and again and again, it never ends. But that feeling, I think\nyou and I were talking about how it's fun to doubt\nyourself because it pushes you to do better work. So if you keep having high stakes, you're going to work all the time, work yourself into the ground, constantly be thinking\nabout, oh this question, I'm not sure if I fully know the answer and all the research behind\nthat, so I should go there. And again, super fun. But I don't just do\nforensic psychology all day. I also own a clinic. I provide therapy. I've been\nproviding therapy for 15 years. So what happens is you have clients who maybe you've stopped seeing, but when they have a\ncrisis in their lives, they reach out to you again,\neven if it's seven years later. So you've accumulated 100s of clients who at any given time are gonna reach out when they're in crisis, whether or not you're\nworking on a federal case or in Virginia for this. And that is never going to be\nsomething easy to grapple with because I feel that I am\nletting somebody down. I know I am because these are\npeople I genuinely care about and they care about me and they trust me and I wanna be able to be there for them. I know that it's\ndisappointing if I can't be. And it's also very\ndifficult to separate out the professional therapy relationship from loving someone\nwho you've seen through some of the most difficult\nparts of their lives. And I can explain that\nto people all day long, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's gonna be easy\nfor someone to accept when I can't talk to them. And they just found out, you know, their husband was leading\na double life or, you know, their sister just died and\nI can't even get on a call because I am getting maybe\n15 messages like that a day, and have to testify and\nhave to run my practice. So I think that was why\nI need to slow down. This case, I was doing all of that, and then like the academic\nload or the work involved was just tremendous. And some stuff happened. Like my dad, he started\nhaving his cognitive decline. I got a medical diagnosis\nthat is stress-induced. I really thought I was\ngetting away with it. I really believed that people who talked like a lot about self-care\nwere kind of full of shit and just didn't know\nhow to push themselves. I still believe in pushing ourselves, but I think I kind of\ntraversed into an area without realizing it, where I\nwas no longer pushing myself to challenge myself or\nsee what I was capable of, I was almost pushing\nmyself like as a necessity 'cause I didn't know\nwhat else to do anymore. Just an obligation. It wasn't even, yeah. I wasn't pushing myself to do, the Depp/Heard case\nreminded me of that feeling of pushing myself to do something I wasn't sure I was capable of and overcoming that\nchallenge, that was rewarding. But when you're piling that on\nwith like running a business and all these other things\nand trying to be perfect at all of them, that just starts to become like a feeling of necessity\nand it's not healthy. - That said, you somehow\nmanage to hold it all together to put forward a masterful\nperformance and like you said, still take care of all these clients 'cause you're the most\nimportant person in their lives for many of them. Is there a secret to\nthat? Is there any hacks? Is is there- - I don't sleep a lot. I don't get a... No. And honestly, it's\nnot 100, it's not... It's a work in progress, right? I don't have an answer for, I wouldn't want my life\nto be any other way. You know, I wouldn't\nhave had the opportunity to work on this case if I\nhadn't established my practice and had outreach. And so I can't figure out like\nwhich piece you take it out without it all crumbling. But I would love to have\na little more downtime. - So it all kind of works together. And this passion is the fuel that's behind all of it, probably. That's probably the reason you haven't lost your mind quite yet. - Maybe, yeah, maybe. Unless, I mean, it depends who you ask. (both laughing) - What about the stress of\njust being in the public eye? Has that been difficult for you? - That's a lovely question,\nthank you for asking it, 'cause it is nice to\ntalk to you about this 'cause I feel like you probably\nunderstand it a little bit. That was something I was\nabsolutely unprepared for. Like I said, I had no idea\nhow many people were watching when I testified, I had no idea. And I got off the stand, I kind of staggered to the back room and truly thought about\nlying down on the floor 'cause I was so exhausted. And, you know, I'd been\nup studying all my stuff, terrified that I was gonna\nforget some statistic about the MMPI-2. - It's gonna be so\ngreat. It's great for me. It's gonna be great for\npeople to hear this, that you're human, your two flaws, (both laughing) that's extremely stressful\nfor many, many hours. I wondered how you can sit\nthere for so many hours and stay so focused and listen\nso well, it's so difficult. - Well, I mean, I could\ntalk about that too. The moment I came to almost like, came back to my body\nand realized where I was and just wanted it to stop and felt like I was burning alive. I just was thinking, I\ndon't wanna do this anymore. I don't wanna do this\nanymore. Is this gonna stop? And then another question came and I just had to get back to it. But so after I testified the first time, I went in that back room, I might have laid down on the ground. It's kind of a blur. I mean, I might have. I do remember that Wayne Dennison, one of the senior managing\npartners at Brown Rudnick, who is a phenomenal guy\nand absolutely brilliant. I will be indebted to him for\nlife because I trusted him. I trusted him. And that made all the difference in probably how I testified. But he came in the back and\nhe was looking at his phone and he said, \"You're on\nthe cover of 'Time.'\" Something on, you know, like Apple news. And I thought, I mean I really, I thought he was messing with me. I thought it was his\njoke way of saying like, I did great."

      "section": "PTSD",
      "text": "- You've worked with veterans. What is PTSD in the that context? What's the landscape of\npsychological sufferings that veterans soldiers go through? (Shannon sighing) - Well, if we're talking\nabout combat exposure, you're seeing things\nyou're not meant to see. You're seeing the worst of humanity. People harming other people. It's not natural for others\nto intend to harm us. It's not natural for us to harm others. And this dehumanization can\noccur that's so troubling and disturbing that\npeople have a hard time living with it later. Or they just feel this ongoing anger. It depends, it depends on the\ntrauma they're exposed to. It depends on, you know, whether their convoy\nwas ambushed by weapons that were purchased from money that was given to this village\nfrom the US government. It depends on whether they did something that they have a hard time\nreconciling outside of war, now that they're back\nhome in civilization. Depends on whether they\nlost a lot of their comrades and feel that guilt of being a survivor. And again, not everybody develops PTSD. It really, it's a mental\ndisorder, it's serious. We talk so much about trauma and PTSD gets thrown around lightly, when actually it's very difficult to meet the full criteria\nfor that diagnosis. And many people experience\nsevere trauma in their lives and only about 14% are likely\nto actually develop PTSD. It's an exception, not the norm. Traumatic stress is absolutely normal. After something traumatic happens, you'll likely have nightmares,\nyou'll likely have anxiety, you'll feel depressed\nbecause you're a human being and something abnormal happened. But PTSD is a longer-standing condition that is significantly\nimpairing in a person's life. And I think we've lost that in some of the sort of narrative in society. It just, everybody has PTSD, but no, you can have traumatic\nstress, you can be distressed, you can be affected by trauma and not have that particular diagnosis. PTSD significantly impairs people's lives. - How do veterans, how do soldiers who suffer from PTSD or are close to that kind\nof diagnosis begin to heal? What's the path for healing? - Well, I will hand it to the military because I think in terms of working with their active\nduty service members, they really invest\nheavily in mental health. The US Department of\nDefense was one of the first to bring animal-assisted therapy into any type of treatment\nin the early 1900s with bringing, you know,\nfarming into certain hospitals and letting veterans help with the farms and brush the horses, which is so advanced because now we have all this research on animal-assisted therapy\nand how beneficial it is. And just looking in the eyes of a dog can increase your pain threshold and speed healing after a cardiac arrest. Help people with dementia\nto ambulate more freely. It's incredible stuff, simple. And the military was\nahead of the game on that. And I don't think that's changed. I did my training at a\nmilitary hospital in Hawaii, Tripler Army Medical Center, it was phenomenal training and, you know, our psych department, there was so much\ninteresting research going on and it was so integrated. So you might not imagine that the military would be doing this, but we\nhad an acupuncture department, we had a chiropractic department,\nwe had a yoga section, we were doing yoga sessions there. I mean, anything that has\nevidence to support its efficacy was being utilized. And I think that's pretty\ncool about our government. They have a lot of funding so I'm glad they're using it on that. The real challenge I think\ncomes with the large scale need at the veteran population, and they slip through the cracks. I know that the DOD had a campaign going where they were doing outreach\nto anybody who served, for instance in the Vietnam War. The problem is they were trying to get all of these people assessed\nfor PTSD and it was great. Like, they were getting phone calls, mail, it was sort of saying, \"Hey,\nwe know that you served, come on in. Or let's schedule you an\nexam with a psychologist and just see if you're owed benefits.\" The idea of it's great. The problem is that they outsourced to this third-party company. They're paying really low\nrates for a one-hour meeting with a vet. And you don't need to\nbe specifically trained in assessing PTSD. And so you're getting these\nvariations and opinions that are coming through. And I've had clients who, to me, who I've worked with for years, who have clear combat-related PTSD according to gold standard measures, according to my knowing them\nand observing their symptoms and how impaired they are. And it is clearly associated with combat, the content of their intrusive thoughts, their nightmares, et cetera. And they are having a one-hour meeting sometimes by phone with\none of these psychologists who's been contracted by this\nthird-party organization. That's not even enough\nfor me to get through the first through few symptom questions on the CAPS-5 assessment for PTSD. But in that hour the\npsychologist is saying, \"Definitively, no PTSD.\" And it's been a travesty for some people, especially for those who\nneed an advocate the most. It tends to happen to my veterans who are maybe a little\nbit less sophisticated in presenting or\nadvocating for themselves, more humble, less, you know, the guys who need deserve\nit the most, right? They're just getting passed\nover and it's a maze. I'm not quite sure what\nthe solution is, though, before, I mean I've worked\nfor government agencies. It's a massive population. I love that the outreach is even happening and trying to get these\nguys in for assessment. I think we can criticize any system. I'm glad that system is even happening, but it still needs to be better. - So I've gotten to a chance to interact with a lot of soldiers that\nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan. And now a lot of soldiers from all different kinds\nof nations in Ukraine, went to the front. There's a bond between\nsoldiers unlike any other. I don't know if you can speak\nto, why do you think that is? On the opposite side of PTSD, there's a deep human connection, there's like a love for each other. What is that? What is that about war and combat that creates that kind of- - Well you're seeing, we talked earlier about\nthat vulnerability, right? So I believe that combat, I believe that most survival situations strip away all ego and, I mean, there are a couple\ndifferent layers to this, but I have not served in war. So I wanna be cautious here. But from what I know just about psychology and also from my own\nexperience of survival, survival-type experiences, when you're with a group of people and all the egos stripped\naway, nothing else matters. The focus is on the here and now and a specific mission or your day-to-day, you can get really close. You're very, very vulnerable. And also in my experience, the guys I work with who have served, there aren't a lot of people who understand what they've been through. Not only some of the unspeakable things they've been through in combat, but some of the things that they feel are unspeakable about returning, especially if they are\nexperiencing trauma. A lot of them, you know, some of the things that\nservice members with PTSD are the most reluctant to disclose is the feeling like they may not know if they love their children\nanymore or their wife, that they don't even know\nif they can love anymore. That they feel emotionally numb. That they wanna kill someone. That they have a whole lot of\nracist beliefs and thoughts. There are a lot of things that can be associated with PTSD that aren't as clear or expected. And these guys don't have many people who understand it or they\ndon't think they would, but a lot of their fellow\nservice members do. - Man, so I'm going back to Ukraine and boy, nothing makes, nothing reveals the human condition in a more pure form than war. - [Shannon] Hmm. - Especially the kind of war you get in that part of the world. Especially the war in Ukraine, which is a very 20th century kind of war. - Mm-hmm. Brutal. - (sighing) Well like I mentioned\nin a few different ways,"

He said to me, \"Shannon,\njust pick anything. Pick anything. If you like it at all\nstudying it, just pick it.\" He was like, \"Look, don't\nworry about the job. You don't even know all\nthe jobs that exist. Pick something you like,\nyou will make it your own.\" And that is exactly what happened. I like psychology. I was\nreading some self-help books. It's not like I had this\ncalling where I, you know, looking back I can\nactually create that story 'cause I think now it makes a lot of sense that I do what I do. But I was lost and scared. I started studying psychology. I met a professor who\nwas really inspiring, who wasn't even a psychology professor, but he was public policy. I stayed in touch with that professor. He is a dear friend still to this day. That was 20 years ago. We do research together in Mexico, integrative research with, you know, public policy officials and\nenvironmental engineers. And I get to be the\npsychologist on the trip. I never ever dreamed that that\nsort of stuff could happen. I didn't know about forensic psychology. I also wanna warn anybody who's interested in forensic psychology that it's not like you're like solving crimes all day and getting calls by the FBI. You are going to be sitting\nalone in your home office with your husband bringing\nyou like bowls of cereal and reminding you to go to the bathroom 'cause you haven't gotten\nup in like 24 hours from the computer, and you're gonna have\npapers all around you. And you're just gonna write 75 dense pages with citations of like science. It's brutal, it's academic- - But you're gonna love it. - But it's fulfilling. My friend Frannie posted\na meme of one of the girls from \"Glee\" or something,\ncrying and saying like, \"I'm the happiest I've ever been.\" And she said, it reminds her\nof when I try to convince her to do forensic psych, 'cause I think her mind is perfect for it. You have to be strategic and thorough. But it's a slog. But it's wonderful. It's wonderful. - The image of your\nhusband bringing you cereal while you work on the 75 pages is maybe the most romantic\nthing I've ever heard."

Contempt is when you are\nlooking at your partner from a superior position. So you are eye rolling, you are name calling, there's a mockery, mocking, even physical\nmockery, imitating them, imitating their voice. Contempt is meant to\njust take the legs out from your partner, make\nthem feel pathetic, ridiculous, and it can be abusive, but most people have engaged in contempt at some point in their relationship. Lower level would be\nsort of the eye rolling, but that is the biggest\npredictor of a split. - The following is a\nconversation with Shannon Curry, a clinical and forensic psychologist who conducts research, therapy\nand psychological evaluations pertaining to trauma,\nviolence and relationships. She received worldwide\nattention in April of last year by giving a lengthy televised testimony on her psychological\nevaluation of Amber Heard during the Johnny Depp/Amber Heard trial. I found her testimony to\nbe an eloquent description of complex psychological concepts and evaluations procedures. So I reached out for a chat. In person, she was brilliant, funny, thoughtful, and truly kind. I really, really enjoyed\nthis conversation. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Shannon Curry. Charles Bukowski said that\nlove is a fog that burns away with the first daylight of reality. I love that quote. Do you think romantic love\nfades away in this way? - Bukowski.\n- Does it have to fade? - The truth is that you\nhave all of these chemicals pumping through your body. You're essentially high on heroin in the beginning of a romance, and you're going to have\nthese rose-colored glasses on. Everything your partner does is magical. But really it's the novelty. It's just like going on a\nvacation. You're fully present. You're just attuned to the\nmagic of another human being, moment to moment. And then on top of that, you have, you're just flooded with dopamine. So you're high on drugs. And\nwe can't go on like that. You will die if you are using\nthese kinds of chemicals all the time, all day long. So eventually our bodies are\nsort of made to dial it down. We've made it. I mean, we\nare evolutionary beings. We are doing the same thing\nwe did 200,000 years ago to find a mate, procreate, spend\nenough time with each other that we have sex a whole bunch\nof times and make babies. Now we've changed the rules of the game. We're living, you know, almost till we're 100\nyears old, in some cases, we're making these marriage commitments that last half a century, and we're expecting it to\nbe all because of love. And we're signing these\ncontracts based on how we feel when we're high on these drugs. So the reality is we know based on the... And I'm also talking about certain western civilizations\nhere, because as you know, there are arranged marriages. And a lot of times, those marriages, if we're looking at longevity, are actually way more satisfied than people who are marrying for love, which logically makes sense. If you're making a\ndecision based on a feeling that is basically based on endorphins and dopamine and oxytocin, I wouldn't sign a contract\njust because of a feeling, necessarily, you know, for 50 years. Whereas an arranged marriage, if you have your elders\nkind of deciding for you that this partner has a bunch of traits that you're going to appreciate\nmore and more over time, I think there's some wisdom there. - So you don't think that\nfeeling could be a foundation for a 50-year relationship? - Well, I don't think\nthat specific feeling you're having based on drugs\nis going to be the same feeling you have 20, 30, 40 years down the line. If you're gonna wake up\nand turn to your partner when you're 70 and think, oh\nmy God, I'm so glad you're hot. You are so hot. Then\nsure, marry for hotness. But if you've been\nthrough life a little bit, and I think most people who\nare on a second marriage know, shit happens in life, it is hard. You're gonna have, you know,\nmaybe a kid with special needs or your dad gets dementia or\nyou get diagnosed with cancer. Who are you gonna wanna come home to? Who is going to hold you when\nyou are sobbing on the floor and tell you, \"We're gonna\nget through it together\"? Who's gonna know the names of\nyour kid's special ed teacher and the process for getting a 504 plan? Or is it gonna be you on your own? I think those things matter. - But doesn't that hotness, don't those drugs kind of solidify into a deeper appreciation\nof the other person into something you could call beauty? - Yes, they can.\n- But isn't that the same? Isn't that the same thing? When you notice the beauty\nof another human being, aren't you high on drugs still? You're making it sound like there's like a brief rockstar period of going on heroin and then it's over. But like, can't you be on\nheroin your whole life, or like- - I have some good news.\n- Microdosing. - I have some good news. That was something, I think one of the reasons I\ngot into studying relationships was because I wanted that, right? So I'm a scientist, but I also love art and I love writing and I love literature. I wanted to know that\ntrue love could be real, but as a scientist, I am cynical. I just need some data. And so I practice a type of therapy called the Gottman Method. And I love that because it tends to be, well, it is one of the most\nevidence-based therapies we have based on John and Julie Gottman, two psychologists who have\nbeen researching relationships for now about 50 years. And this therapy happens\nto be for couples. They found that you absolutely\ncan make longevity work in a relationship. You can build. You are not just settling\nfor companionship, but you can have passion and intimacy and growing love and appreciation. But there is a blueprint, a set of skills that we were never given, we're not taught it in school. We changed the rules of the game and we haven't learned the rules yet. - And the Gottman Method\nfor couples therapy kind of gives you a few guidelines, the rules for longevity in a relationship. - Yeah, they did a beautiful\njob at taking these findings they had through, you\nknow, decades of research, quantifying it and then codifying\nit into a therapy method. It's really skills-based. I tell couples when they're\nstarting out with me that they're essentially\ngonna be starting a class. - So what's the 5 to 1 golden rule? What I read is there's the\nkind of balance you can achieve of how many interactions\nyou have in a relationship that are positive versus negative. And I think that's what the 5 to 1 means. But basically, there should\nbe kind of an empirical, like if you just look back over a month, how many of the\ninteractions were positive, how many were negative.\n- Or the day. Look at the day, right? So the idea of this ratio,\nwell, it's not an idea, it was a finding, it is a research finding that the Gottman's got after\nlooking at thousands of couples and codifying these interactions\nthat they were observing. Couples that tend to be\nsatisfied in their relationships, that are happier, they have\nbetter health, et cetera, they are having approximately\nfive positive interactions to each negative. And I wanna be clear about\nwhat I'm defining as positive and negative here. So this doesn't necessarily\nmean that you're, these don't need to be big,\nsweeping, romantic gestures, buying flowers, having sex. These are things like paying attention to what we call your partner's bids. We make these bids for affection, for connection all the\ntime in our relationships, not just with our partners,\nbut with our friends, our coworkers. And we may not even know\nwhat our style of bid is, but if you see them on a sheet, you can pretty quickly identify them. Bids could be wanting to show your partner or tell your partner something and have them be proud of you. It could be wanting to go buy\ngroceries with your partner, doing things together. \"Hey, you wanna come with me?\" It could be telling a joke\nand hoping that your wife looks up from her email on the\ncomputer and acknowledges it. If she laughs, then you've got a positive. But if I don't even look up,\nthat's a negative, right? So it's not necessarily\nthat I'm calling my husband an asshole, it's just am\nI connecting with him? Am I meeting those bids for\nconnection and vice versa? - Do those also give you a\nguide of how you should behave? - Well, I think what's really important is actually asking your\npartner or paying attention to what your partner's bids are. Because what matters to Ty, my husband, may not matter to you. For instance, I mean, Ty's bar is so low with me. I thank God for him. - [Lex] In terms, what defines\na positive interaction? - Right, like he just wants me to ask him if he wants a water when I\nget up to get myself one. Just be a basic, decent,\nconsiderate person is all he asks of me. Whereas mine might be sort of\nlike, stay up later with me, watch a show, go to bed\nat the same time as me or know about the people in\nmy life, that sort of a thing. - I should highlight this and I hope, hopefully it's okay that you\nwere running a little bit late and you sent me this text,\nwhich people do really rarely, and there's a subtle act of\nkindness within that text. So the text you sent was\nthat I just decreased the amount of stress in your\nlife or something like this by saying it's cool. But that means that you were, you're signaling that you were stressed because you care enough\nto be there on time. And that was like, that\nmade me feel really special. I was like, \"Oh,\" you know, people don't often-\n- You're a brilliant guy. - People don't always do that because that puts you also,\nthat makes you vulnerable. - Vulnerable.\n- And that- - I actually thought that after I sent it. But I feel that most of the\nday, any interaction like, oh God, I just exposed myself. But absolutely, I was excited to be here and I didn't want you to\nthink that I didn't care. I think being a therapist\nhas shown me that it really, it's so lucky to be in that\nposition because you meet people that you would've thought\nare cooler than you or smarter than you, or just\nsomehow impervious to life. And you realize that we\nare all in it together. We all want to be cared about and liked. We all wanna be liked as a baseline. Some people will say they don't care, but everybody does, it's human. And I have gotten much\nbetter being a therapist, much more comfortable showing caring, showing love and genuineness\nand vulnerability than I think I ever\nwould've been otherwise. - And that kind of\nvulnerability is what's required to do a positive interaction\nin a relationship. - I think so. And people have different\nlevels of comfort, right? But as long as it's\nworking for both partners. And typically, you have to communicate to figure out what makes your\npartner feel cared about. However you might be\nworking, for instance, with an older couple, and I have a couple that's perfectly happy and they sort of have a\nsystem, it works for them. If there's some sort of a rupture, if they get in to some\nsort of a disagreement, they don't talk it out. She might go to the store, run an errand, do a little shopping. He'll work in the wood shop\nand then they'll come back and there is a repair attempt, though. But it's maybe she'll say, \"Hey, do you wanna have\ndinner or come, you know, I made your favorite dinner.\" Or he'll say, \"Hey, I\nrecorded your favorite show, you wanna watch it tonight.\" So they don't need to process it. But there is an understanding between them that we're still in this together, we care about each other and\nthere's a repair attempt. Most people need to be\nable to process it verbally and talk about what happened. - Oh, interesting.\n- But not all. - So for most people, if there's a conflict you\nshould talk about and resolve it and repair it versus like\njust put it behind you. - I don't wanna say should. I guess it depends on the couple. Everybody processes emotions differently. Everybody handles emotional\nexpression differently. I mean, I have couples\nwhere I have one person in the partnership who has\nautism and the other doesn't. And so they're obviously\ngoing to have different ways of communicating or\nprocessing what happened. We all have different perspectives. It really depends on what makes a person feel like it's been repaired? What makes a person feel understood? Does that need to be verbal? Or in the case of that older couple I have where they know they\nunderstand one another because there's a gentleness\ntoward one another after. - What are some common\nways relationships fail that you've observed in all\nthe therapy you've done? - Oh, well the Gottman's identified what they call the four\nhorsemen, the apocalypse, so- - Okay, what are the four horsemen? - I mean, I could just keep it simple and go off their research. So those are four different behaviors that they identify in couples or that you can identify in couples that are really highly\npredictive of a divorce. Some more than others, but I'll start with the lower ones. So one thing that we, and by the way, actually, we all do these things, these that would be in that 5 to 1 ratio, you'd wanna stay away from some of these, these are the ones. So as they pile up, now that\nratio's gonna get imbalanced and then you are headed for a split. - Yeah.\n- Okay? So the first is criticism. So criticism is when we have a complaint. Complaints are normal, but instead of owning our own\nproblems, our own feelings, we assume that our perspective is the only valid, accurate perspective. And so we take it upon ourselves to tell our partner what\nis wrong with them, okay? So there's essentially no real belief that they might have a\nvalid perspective too. So this could look like\nyou never help me out with the house. Or even, you're so lazy,\nlike can't I just get you for five seconds to help with the kids? Or something like that. And then what happens is horseman\nnumber two, defensiveness. So not everybody is defensive just because they were criticized. Some people just are more prone to defensiveness than others. None of us really like\nadmitting our faults. So it's pretty natural. But defensiveness is\nessentially making excuses or worse, turning it\naround on your partner, not accepting any responsibility and definitely not validating\nwhat they're feeling. Now if you get criticized enough or if you get really flooded, the flooding is what happens\nwhen our heart rate goes up kind of around 100 beats per minute, our frontal lobe shuts down. That's our thoughtful\nbrain, our logical brain, and our reptilian kind of hind\nbrain takes over our thinking and we just go into fight\nor flight, in a way. We just wanna annihilate our partner instead of say anything\nthat would be helpful to the relationship. So if you're getting flooded,\nyou could do a couple things. You could get super critical,\nyou could get contemptuous, which I'll talk about in a\nsecond, it's the last horseman. Or you do the third horseman,\nwhich is stonewalling. And in their research, the Gottman's found that men are actually\nmore likely to stonewall. I also am someone who\nstonewalls, (laughing) but it's where you just sort of disconnect from the conversation. You shut down, you turn away, you can physically even turn\naway, kind of arms crossed, but you're just, you're shut off. And stonewalling happens\nusually because you get flooded. You feel like you can't win, you don't know what to do to\nmake the situation better. It feels pretty hopeless and\ntalking feels unproductive. So you can see how in a typical\nheterosexual relationship, the gender dynamic, we\nknow that women tend to use criticism more often\nbecause they're the ones that typically raise issues verbally. And then if men are\nfeeling more criticized, that they tend to stonewall. And it becomes this vicious\ncycle of then more criticism, but the criticism is really\njust a plea to be loved and get your partner\nto show you they care. And then the man tends to feel like he can't do anything right,\nthis isn't even productive. If I say anything, I'm\njust gonna make it worse. And they don't have any real, you haven't given them a\nspecific need, a solution, something they can do to shine\nfor you, so they turn away. - And where does the contempt come in? - All right, so contempt\nis criticism on steroids. This is what John Gottman\ncalls sulfuric acid for love. Nothing will erode a relationship\nquicker than contempt. Contempt is when you are\nlooking at your partner from a superior position. So you are eye rolling, you are name calling, there's a mockery, mocking, even physical\nmockery, imitating them, imitating their voice. Contempt is meant to just take the legs out from your partner, make them feel pathetic, ridiculous. And it can be abusive, but most people have engaged in contempt at some point in their relationship. Lower level would be\nsort of the eye rolling. But that is the biggest\npredictor of a split. - If you allow yourself to think, yeah, that mockery or contempt\njust a little bit, it's like this weird slippery slope. - Sure is.\n- And the opposite is true, where I just look at a person and think, wow, isn't that the most\nlike wonderful creature I've ever seen in my life? Like, just think that. And you notice the little\ndetails about who they are and so I just observe them the\nway you observe like a weird, like peacock at a zoo\nor something like that. - [Shannon] Intention\nis powerful, isn't it? - Yeah, and it changes. You start to notice beautiful things and then let the things that annoy you- - Yes.\n- Like just- - You're exactly right. You're touching on-\n- dissipate. - some really important things. So in relationships, we actually know that\nwearing rose-colored glasses is important, it's healthy, we need it. And it's a choice you're making, right? So there is a saying that getting married is just choosing one\nperson's fault over another. And the reality is that\nwe may become infatuated with somebody else. As human beings, love is an emotion, attraction is an emotion. And as you go through life, even if you're in a\ncommitted relationship, you might see beauty in another. And that person who is novel\nmight seem attractive to you. But if you can remember that\nthey too have a set of problems that you would be marrying, it really helps you to see the\nbeauty in your partner again and recognize all of their\nincredible strengths. And all the ways we meld with the person become our own family, almost become, I mean, our lives intertwine\nand we grow those oak trees. - So to you, by the way, it is a line I read somewhere that when you're wearing\nrose-colored glasses, all the red flags looks just like flags. (Shannon laughing) I think is a good-\n- I love that. - It's a good line.\n- I love that. - So you think that\nhumans are fundamentally, all of us are fundamentally\nflawed or have flaws, they're unique flaws. And that basically\nrelationships is just the way to figure out how the\ntwo can fit together. - Right. And we're different. So no matter what, we're\ngoing to have differences. We are raised differently\nthan our partner. We have different stories,\ndifferent experiences that shaped our value systems, especially when it comes to\nthe big ones like parenting, love, money, these principles\nthat are based in our history, we're gonna have differences. So is this a set of differences\nyou can accept from somebody and work with? Do the benefits and do their strengths, do they make it worth it or is it, are they deal breaker differences? - Tricky question.\n- Sure. - But in the couples you've worked with, is there like the feminine\nand the masculine, is there different dynamics\nthat come into play, like dominance, submissive? Is it like a dance where it just changes from minute to minute? Is there dynamics that you observe that both limit and enable\nsuccessful relationships? - Yes, so there are, if we're talking about masculine/feminine, then how also we could get into, are we talking about actual\ngender, identified gender, or are we just talking about these traits? Because like I said, I stonewall, which is typically in couples, something that is more\nassociated with straight men. But that's my style of coping\nwhen I get overwhelmed. That is not tied to any sort of success or non success of a relationship. But what we do know is that gay couples, so lesbians and gay men tend\nto be gentler with one another when they are having conflict discussions. So that's actually been\nidentified in the research and it's something I've witnessed\nand it's just fascinating. So with my straight couples, I'll be going through one of these, if we're processing the\nconflict that occurred, I'll be going through the sheet. And it's very, very structured because you don't want\ncouples doing more damage when they're there with you. You want them practicing\nskills that protect them from criticism, that\nprotect them from contempt. And when I'm working\nwith a straight couple, I am like a referee, or sometimes I'll relate it\nto being like a ski coach and keeping people on a bunny hill. And you tell them, you let\nthem make like two turns and then you stop them\nand you meet up again because you don't want them to veer off. With straight couples, you are doing very short\nturns before you need to kind of intervene and re-scaffold. I had a lesbian couple recently and they were so lovely with each other. They skipped like seven steps\nto the advanced final portion where they were already\ncoming up with solutions and suggesting things\nthat they might be able to do differently next time to make it better for their partner. They were asking each other questions about how their partner\nfelt, with no agenda, no attempt to sort of be like, \"Well do you think you're\nfeeling that way because,\" which straight couples do all the time. You just see this humility\nand openness. It's lovely. - Yeah, it's lovely. But I wonder if maybe watching\ntoo many Hollywood films, if some of the drama, some of the tension is required for a\npassionate lifelong romance. - No, it's not. And that's great news. So we actually know\nthat the closer you feel to your partner. So if, I mean, you've\ntalked a lot about beauty and you can ignite that\nbeauty, that interest, right? So when you're falling in love, it's usually that a person\nis sort of a mystery to you and you're uncovering these layers that you find really appealing. - Mm-hmm.\n- There are continual layers that you can uncover with\nyour partner over time. I don't think we realize that. I think we get complacent\nand we think we've had every conversation imaginable. What else are they\ngonna do to surprise me? But we don't know the\nquestions to be asking. One of my favorite questions, I like turning these\nconversations kind of into a quiz because I get bored easily. So rather than just asking\nan open-ended question, there's a way you can do\nthis with your partner where it's sort of like the dating game. Like what is my as of yet fondest, but unrealized life dream? And see if your partner knows.\nYou might not even know. They might know you better\nthan you know yourself. That in and of itself\nis a beautiful reminder of the relationship and how special it is. But then also when they say it or when you realize or\nhave to think critically, like what is my husband's\nas of yet unrealized, but fondest life dream? And then you can talk about it. You just, I don't know, you just kind of transcend\ninto this new area and you feel tight again, you\nfeel like, you feel close. - Well you really talk to each other. Like I've recorded and\nwithout intending to publish podcasts like this with\nmicrophones, with friends, with people close to me. Because it is literally that,\nyou get to ask questions like as if it's an interview,\nand we don't do that. - [Shannon] That's exactly it. The way you're talking with me. - Yeah.\n- Sit down with your partner, have that conversation. - Like years later.\n- Right. Show interest, actually be curious. See what they surprise you with. - And actually what you learn is you don't know the answers\nto most of these questions. - [Shannon] 100%. Exactly. - Like what's your favorite\nmovie from the '80s? You might not know the answer to that. It's like those first date\nquestions or whatever. - Or what's your favorite\nmovie this year and why? - [Lex] And why. Yeah, it's fascinating. - Mm-hmm. It is. - It's hard to do that because I think that you'll\nprobably be offended at first how little the other person knows. So I think that you have\nto work through that. - You know, I actually find\nthat there's this rekindling because partners are shocked\nthat their partner does know so much about them. Especially if they've\nbeen feeling dissatisfied or disconnected, it's a reminder of all the\ngood that's still there. - I know we've said some of those things, but what's on the opposite side? What's the key to a\nsuccessful relationship? What are the things you\nsee time and time again that to you designate that\nthey're in a good path? - Yeah, there's a real\nattunement honestly, it's sort of an us\nagainst the world feeling. Neither partner's gonna talk\nshit on them, the other. There's a loyalty. They handle each other in\nthe relationship with care. You can tell that they've\nworked some things. To me, it usually indicates\nthat these are some people who have figured they've\nhad to work some things out. They know that this is delicate. They know, you know,\nthat you're on thin ice, you take a wrong step and you\ncan be back in a tough place in your relationship or\nyou treat it with care and it can be amazing. So they're careful with one another. They give each other compliments.\nThey are considerate. So you'll see, you know, he'll bring the car around\nfor her because it's raining, or she'll bring him home\nsome takeout, you know, she'll order for him\ntoo at the restaurant. They keep each other\nin each other's minds. - But that us against the world thing, that definitely is there. Like if you-\n- 100%. You've seen that, right? - Yeah. You've seen it. And you've seen it like, I like it when couples have\nbeen together for a long time and when one is talking,\nthe other one looks at them. If you don't do that,\nthat's not a bad sign. But it's a good sign when you do that. - Yes.\n- And I think it's actually a really good exercise to do because I enjoy it when I see in others, it's a way to show that you\ndon't take them for granted and that you still find\nthem like this mysterious, wonderful creature to observe. Like, I think too often we\nhave that with our parents, we have that with people close to us. You think, yeah, I've heard\nwhat they're about to say. I know you can complete their sentences. - [Shannon] Yeah, take them for granted. - And then if you just\nlook at them and say, \"Wow, this is the most brilliant person I've ever seen in my life.\" I can't, you know, just\nappreciate every word that comes out of them and\nlook at them in that way, you actually begin to believe it. - Yeah.\n- And you actually begin to see the beauty of what they're saying. - You are exactly right. It's\na self-fulfilling prophecy. - And they-\n- And it's caring. Yeah. - Yeah.\n- It's very caring. So that's, I mean that's, I think the beauty of what the\nGottman research showed us, taught us, provided us is\nthat we can do these things that become cyclic and just\nkeep growing this relationship, making it stronger, more\npowerful, more loving. You would never want to cut it down. - Well you were talking about the sheet for conflict processing.\n- Mm-hmm. - What are we talking about? So like a couple will come and say like there was this conflict\nand you put it on the table and then what does it mean to process it? - Well, so in that\nGottman Method of therapy, there are all these different, I mean 100s of different interventions. And based on what the\nissue is in that session, you can decide the most\nappropriate intervention. And so this is a specific intervention for if it is a conflict that occurred, and there are different\ntypes of conflicts. So this would be more like an incident. It's not a perpetual recurring problem, which has actually a\ndifferent intervention where you kind of look at the underlying belief systems, values. And the goal is not to solve that problem. The goal in that situation\nis to actually just get a better understanding of each other and your positions and just, you stop seeing your\npartner as the adversary and you start seeing them\nas a person who makes sense. But if there's been a specific event, a specific fight that's\njust sort of situational, but it's left bad blood, things were said, or you didn't feel understood, this intervention I was talking about is one that you would go\nthrough a series of steps where first you identify the\nemotions that you were feeling, then you describe play by play your movie, your perspective. If your partner were\nlooking through your eyes, this is what they heard, saw,\nthought, then they saw this, then they heard this. So you're not saying, \"Yeah, then you came in and were\nyelling and acting crazy.\" You're saying, \"So then I saw you come in, I heard you say, and I thought\nto myself, well, great, now everything's ruined,\" right? So you're showing them your movie, then they have to\nsummarize the movie for you and then vice versa. And then there's this step\nwhere each person validates some part that they can understand. Based on what you saw, heard, I can actually understand how you felt one of those feelings that you said. And then my favorite part is\nyou rewind sort of the movie from that day back through into childhood and you land on a time, a memory when you felt a similar set of feelings. And this is like the\nmost beautiful part ever. Because let's say the feeling\nwas I felt misunderstood, I felt misjudged, un-cared about, unloved, like you didn't even like me. And I'll say, \"When did you feel that way? You know, land on a time.\" And they're like, \"My\nwhole childhood, you know, my parents were, my mom\nwas always accusing me of doing things I wasn't doing. And it would set me up and\nmy dad would come home, he'd hear about it, he\nwould just believe her.\" And then you have like a partner\nclimbing up on the couch, like to give their partner a hug while they're sharing the\nstory, it's beautiful. And it changes the way you\ninteract in future disagreements. - [Lex] So you have those moments. - Yeah, you can't unlearn, now you know this about your partner, you know what they're sensitive to. - Yeah, and again, you\nkind of see the beauty and the flaws then.\n- Right. - And you, (chuckling) - [Shannon] It all makes sense, right? - Yeah. It all kind of makes sense. - Yeah, so you maybe were in\nthis dumpster dive in your head of how your partner sucks and all the things that\nare wrong with them and it's so hopeless. And then you get this light\nshining through and you realize, oh my God, of course they\nwould be sensitive to that. And suddenly it's not about all the ways your partner is wrong and\nproving that they're wrong. It's just how can I in\nthe future make sure they do not feel this again? I would never want this person I love to misunderstand me and feel so unloved. - The early days of that, what do you think about the whole dating, modern dating process? How do you find a partner that you can stay with\nfor the rest of your life? - So we are absolutely doing it wrong, but there is a way you can do it. And I am such a fan of this\npsychologist Ty Tashiro. I adore him. He's brilliant, he's lovely. He's also very humble. Just a wonderful salt-of-the-earth guy. I'm gonna tell you a very true story here. - Uh-huh. - Okay?\n- Let's go. - I was in a bad relationship and I was at a psychology conference with my partner at the time. We were both at this conference and we were sitting in a lecture\nhall there for Ty Tashiro to do his talk that day\non his phenomenal research on relationship satisfaction and dating. And I was sitting next to him\nand we had been, you know, it was just always unpleasant on trips. There were always fights. And we're sitting there and\nTy Tashiro starts talking about his research and how he\nfound that most people are, you know, signing this agreement, getting married and doing it\nbased on the love endorphins. And really only about 35%\nof anybody who's married is actually happy. And he said, \"So then, you know- - That's a pretty low number.\n- Exactly. But here's what I love about Ty Tashiro is he didn't stop there. He wanted to know what\nthose people who were happy had in common. And then same thing with\nthe people who were unhappy, he found a couple fascinating patterns. So the couples who were happy\ntended to rate their partners higher in three different traits. And I love talking about this because if you are somebody\nwho can follow instructions, you can find this. I mean, very easily. Those three traits tend to\nbe conscientiousness, okay? And I love the word conscientiousness because it's not just kindness. Kindness is a good way to think of it. But you can be kind and\nkind of be a pushover. And that's not attractive. Conscientiousness is smart, attentive. It's somebody who reads into\na text message and thinks, wow, she was making herself\nvery vulnerable there. That's conscientiousness. - I like how you just\nthrew in a compliment. - No but it's-\n- Appreciate it. - It's true, it's a certain intelligence, awareness and attunement. And then on top of that,\nconscientiousness is motivated. So you can't be on your ass\nall day and be conscientious 'cause then you can't meet the needs that you anticipate about the person. So conscientious is that guy\nwho drives the car around in the rainstorm so his\nwife's hair doesn't get wet. It's my husband who checks\nmy alarm for me every morning 'cause he knows I'm\nterrible at time management and he makes sure that I set\nit a reasonable amount of time before my first meeting and not the 20 minutes I think I need. And then he'll come wake\nme up with a cup of coffee. That is ultimate conscientiousness. And it is true. I mean, I will tell you as somebody who's with\na conscientious partner, your love increases over\ntime as you continue to feel grateful and admiring of that person. The second one, you\nwant somebody who is low in a big five personality\ntrait called neuroticism. You want somebody\nemotionally stable in a way. Now this doesn't mean you can't, I'm somebody who doesn't get the blues or struggle with mental health issues. Trust me, Ty is with\nsomebody who, you know, I'm all over the place. But you want somebody who\nkind of owns their shit and isn't going to just be emotionally unstable all over. You know, you want somebody\nwho is generally happy and has some life satisfaction. Having a partner who has serious,\nnot mental health issues, but unmitigated emotional\ndistress and instability is really hard on the partner. And it's really hard on\nother family members, including children if you have children. So it's just a predictor of happiness. - So there's a certain threshold of chaos that if you exceed it-\n- Well said. - is going to be destructive to a long-term relationship.\n- That is a perfect description. - But then again-\n- Without chaos. Not the mystery chaos you love\nwith your little poet brain. I'm talking more like just somebody who there's just no peace, there's no peace. There's a problem with everything. Everything becomes more difficult. Going to a party is a chore, you don't know if they're gonna\nhave a meltdown at the party or how many complaints about your friends or everything is a problem. So you want somebody who\nhas just some resiliency, I think is a good term\nfor it, some flexibility. - [Lex] Some spice is\nokay, but not too much, like the-\n- Right. Flexibility, resiliency, easygoing, okay? The third-\n- Yeah. - is really interesting I think. So he found that having a partner with sort of moderate adventurousness, not high adventurousness, actually leads to greater satisfaction. And the reason for that\nis high adventurousness equals novelty seeking. - Wow.\n- Shiny new things. And so if you're in a\nmonogamous relationship, if that is what's important to you, it's going to be very hard for a partner who is novelty seeking to be faithful. So that will cause a lot of pain. But also novelty-seeking people tend to always have new\nprojects, new interesting things. And so their attention is drawn\naway from the relationship. And so you can just feel pretty\nneglected or unimportant. - By a little bit. - But you want a little\nbit of adventurousness. So you want your person to\nbe sort of self-motivated, individuated, have their own interests, not completely dependent\non you, but also, I mean, low adventurousness is not a bad thing. Ultimately what you're getting with low to moderate\nadventurousness is that rock, that feeling of stability, that home. And I made some references earlier, like when you're 70 and\nyou turn to your partner, do you want him to be hot or, you know? For instance, my dad\nhas dementia right now and my husband turned to me on the plane, we were all coming back from a trip and where we really saw\nhow severe it's getting. And he just turned to me, he\nknew how much pain I was in, even though I wasn't showing it. And he said, \"I want you to\nknow that if it comes to a point where we need to take care of your dad, he needs to live with us,\nyou don't even need to ask. I am 100% on board and will help.\" And those are the things that\nmatter, that home feeling. And technically that's\na trait that's usually, that's sort of a, my husband caring so much\nabout family and home and taking care of things that matter, those are things that\ntend to be associated with that low to moderate adventurousness, somebody who really cares\nabout simple things and family. - I wonder if those three things are something you can work on. You know, conscientiousness,\nyou can probably- - You can.\n- Proactively observe yourself and, you know, do it more regularly. - Right.\n- Neuroticism might be the hardest one probably to control.\n- I think so. Well no, I mean, I was pretty neurotic in my early 20s. - And when you wake up to it, maybe you, if you're self-aware about it, maybe you'll be able to control it. - Yeah, I think self-awareness is key. I think that's why I love therapy so much. I think life is about growth\nand our potential for growth and to make our own lives better, to make the lives of others better, to serve others, to heal. All of us are this collective healing, and I think we're all capable of growth. - And the same with adventurousness. I'm somebody that's\npretty low an adventure, but I keep throwing myself out there just for the extra adventures,\nso you can grow in that way. - Yes, and I am high in adventurousness and I was not really ready to settle down. I was married earlier in my 20s. But I would say that I\nam much more prepared to be in a committed\nlong-term relationship now in my 40s than I was when I was younger. - But in that same way, for me, I like to connect myself\nto high adventure people so that it, like, brings me out. It's like they're a horse\nand I get to ride them or something.\n- Yeah. And that's the thing. So high adventure people are attractive, they're interesting, exciting. But it can be a world of\nheartbreak because, you know, you're only under that\nspotlight for a few minutes and then they're onto\nthe next shiny thing. - Yeah, but heartbreak is part of love. But that might be the drug thing that you were talking about. Speaking of adventurousness,\nwhat about sex? What role-\n- Oh, sex is important. - does sex play in a\nsuccessful relationship? - Well it, okay, so I'm\nsaying it's important, but I wanna qualify that. Everybody has different levels of sex that are satisfying to them. Sex can definitely bond\nyou to your partner. Orgasms are amazing. They de-stress us. They're healthy. I mean you can have an orgasm and have a lower level\nof stress for 48 hours. I think that's pretty incredible. If you have, I mean, just\nthat kind of physical contact with your partner, even a\n20-second hug with your partner has similar benefits to an orgasm. You're gonna have a lower stress level. You're gonna feel immediately\ncloser to your partner. You're gonna get a rush of oxytocin, which is gonna make you feel happier, more grounded throughout the day. So that's a 20-second hug. You extrapolate that to sex\nand things are gonna be great. - Mm-hmm. So it's just physiological? - Mm-hmm.\n- But I wonder, there's probably metrics\nabout how often you have sex, how that correlates to successful\nrelationships and so on. - Well there are, but it\nreally has more to do, it's sort of like, remember\nI was talking about processing conflict and what matters is do people feel like it's been resolved? Do they feel like there's been a repair? Not necessarily how they go\nabout doing it. Same with sex. Does each partner feel sexually satisfied? So that could be once\na month for one couple, it could be five times a\nweek for another couple. It could be never for\nother couples, truly. I mean, so sex has a ton of benefits, but its absence isn't\nnecessarily detrimental, I guess, would be the qualifier\ndepending on who you are. - And I know couples that use sex as part of the conflict\nresolution process. - It's hugely effective for that. If it works for both parties. All parties. - That's true.\n- Not just both. All. - That's true. What do you think about infidelity? You know, what's the cause of infidelity? Why do men and women cheat? - It's different for\neverybody, but I mean, even earlier I was saying\nwith adventurousness, like if monogamy is\nsomething you're doing, I've seen in my own practice, I've seen the entire range of couples who are open about having\nsexual relationships with other people and fine with it. Couples who wanna be fine with\nit, but find out they're not. Couples who aren't just couples. Couples with multiple people, you know, multiple romantic relationships. I've had couples where\naffairs are tolerated and not talked about, they're not enjoyed, but they are not the type of betrayal that will destroy the relationship. Sort of a understanding\nand keep it outta my face. And then also we won't talk about it. - So an affair that happened without getting permission first, and as long as you don't talk about it, it's not going to do a\ndamage to the relationship? - Right, but we can't even\ntalk about it like that, right? - Okay.\n- So nobody's going to admit that the affair is happening. There can't be any evidence of it. It's sort of a just look the\nother way type of a situation. But the partner who is not\nhaving the affair, right, they typically know. They certainly know that their\npartner is capable of that. They just kind of know, but they don't want it in their face. It would become a problem\nif it was in their face. As long as certain needs are met and everything else is okay at home, it's just one of those things\nwhere don't ask, don't tell. - Well, that's an interesting point 'cause I had a bunch of\narguments with people. I tend to hang out with,\nespecially in the tech sector, people who really value like\nhonesty and radical honesty. And I keep arguing with\npeople about this because to me, it's not that simple. Like that's an example right there that honesty can be really destructive. Like, honesty is also a\nreally complicated thing to get to the bottom of,\n'cause what is really honest? - Yes.\n- And, you know, like how do I look in this dress? Like, there's a million ways- - It's perspective.\n- to answer that. - Yeah.\n- Perspective. A lot of-\n- It can be cesspool in my mind if I'm in a bad place or my partner and I haven't, like if Ty and I haven't\nbeen connected lately, my honesty of what I\nactually think about him would be horrifically damaging and completely unfounded also. And it can change on a dime. - [Lex] But that's also not actual honesty to the big picture of how you feel about him.\n- Right. - I have interacted with a few folks who talk about their previous\nsexual partners, for example, the numbers of sexual partners they've had and they feel like that kind of honesty is actually empowering and\nenriching to the relationship because all the sexual\nexperiences you've had in the past make you a better sexual partner, better partner in the present. And to me, from the\nculture I've come from, that's like anti-romantic. - Yep. Yep.\n- Like I, you kind of throw the past kind of away, you don't really talk about it. It's kind of there in\nthis amorphous shape, but it's almost as if you've\nmet together for the first time and this is a beautiful new thing, like you're creatures that have woken up from a long slumber. - Right, you're starting anew. - Yeah, starting anew.\n- Right. And you want some mystery there. - Right, I think the mystery and like you have to figure\nthat out about each other. So I'm not exactly sure\nthat honesty is always- - It's not for everyone. And then also is honesty harmful or helpful at certain points too? - Yeah.\n- So you're talking about sort of like disclosing\nprior sexual history? - Yeah.\n- I thought you were going to go to, so if you've had an affair, do you keep that under your hand? - [Lex] Oh, yeah, that's\na really tough question. - Or are you obligated to disclose it? - [Lex] It's a really, that's very- - It's a very tough question. Very tough. - Well, what do you think is the answer? - I have my own personal beliefs. I also then like I have\nmy therapeutic beliefs. I think frankly, and this\nis just me as a human being, not Shannon the psychologist. I believe that if you have\nfucked up, and I, again, I'm coming from a framework\nright now of monogamy. If you are committed to somebody you love and you have fucked up, you don't get to shed\nyour guilt onto them. You need to carry that burden. It's not necessarily,\nI think it's simplistic and unsophisticated to be like, \"But then you're being dishonest.\" I think it's actually selfish\nto unload it on somebody else and give them the trauma of imagining. What we do know about\ninfidelity is that it can create an actual post-traumatic\nstress like experience for the betrayed partner\nwhere they are having intrusive thoughts about it. Those are unwanted thoughts\nand it's uncontrolled. It comes in at multiple times a day. They'll have depressed mood, they'll have nightmares about it. Their entire sense of security, safety, self-esteem gets shattered\nbecause of your actions. I think it's kind of, yeah,\nmoralistic and naive to think well they deserve to know the truth, if you actually know the harm that that sort of betrayal does. Especially if you truly\nmean to stop it, right? - Mm-hmm.\n- So if it was a one and done or if it\nhappened and you've stopped it and you do not intend\nto do it again, frankly, I think you live with that burden. You live with that discomfort. - Thank you for saying that\n'cause I totally agree, but it's like logically it's doesn't quite make sense to give that advice, but psychologically makes complete sense because you really are\ndestroying another person's mind. Their faith in love, in relationships, their trust, everything. And then you're imprisoning\nthem to be stuck with you for months or years if you're\ntrying to work through it, through that torture. So you should be carrying that burden of working through it, I think. Why do you say that that's\nyour personal opinion versus your therapeutic,\nlike what therapeutic- - Well I think everybody\nhas different values. So I think that's a value-based decision because to me, the hierarchy\nis kindness and do no, like do no further harm. Over in that case, over truth, right? - Yeah.\n- Whereas other people, you know, my husband for instance, he is like truth above all else. You don't get to decide\nwhat I know or, you know, you don't get to decide whether or not I can handle that knowledge. So he would even see my determination of, you know, that I should carry\nthe burden sort of arrogant, like, well why don't you\nlet your partner decide whether or not they, you know,\nwhy do you get to choose? I don't know. I think there's\nvalue to both arguments. I absolutely see his point. - [Lex] It's fascinating.\nIt's fascinating. - I absolutely see his point. And his, I think, is like a\nvery humble sort of option, like, you don't get to\nchoose what's better, you just need to give them the information and they can choose. But I think, I don't know,\nI think it's kinder to hold. I think it's going to cause\nyour conscience more discomfort to hold it. And I think there's sort\nof a cleansing we do when we share that information. I think in real life\nmost people disclose it because they can't stand the\nsecret anymore themselves. That, to me, is a selfish act. - And with unemployment\napplications and so on. And just with friends would ask people, \"What do you care more\nabout truth or loyalty?\" Just to get to see how they think about those different questions. And yeah, I was surprised how much variance there is on that. - And also conceptually, I bet, conceptually I don't think we\nactually know where we stand until we're faced with\na situation like that. - Yeah, I think people, a lot of people, especially when they're younger, say especially if they're\nkind of intellectual, they'll say, \"Truth above all else.\" - Yeah.\n- It's like, all right. - [Shannon] You're exactly right. - All right. (both laughing) Until-\n- It's a platitude. - Until you get to hear a\ntruth that truly breaks you, that truly hurts you, it\ncauses suffering to you. And then you realize or a\ntruth you give to somebody else will cause them suffering. And then you get to see that\nsuffering destroy their life and maybe your relationship and so on. And then you're like, \"Oh.\" - Yeah, like should I\nsit my dad down right now and be like, \"Dad, your dementia, like you have dementia again today, I'm gonna tell you, you have... Dad, you're not making sense.\" No, it's not going to be discussed. We're gonna make him comfortable. And I mean, yeah, I think\nit truth can be a little bit of a platitude sometimes. - Some of those complexities\nare all the things involved in the challenges of what makes\na relationship work, right? - Mm-hmm.\n- What do you think about open relationships in general? My worldview is such that I see the beauty and value in monogamous\nrelationships just for me, but I'm also open to the possibility of what works for other people. Have you done any kind\nof work with the people in open relationships? - As clients or research? - As clients?\n- Oh yeah. Yeah. - Is there some interesting differences between open relationships\nand monogamous relationships? - You know, I think that\nmay have been actually what was behind my question\nabout the satisfaction with them being on the extremes. My hypothesis essentially\nwas is that because they, if you are really all in, you've worked out some of the kinks. I think I've seen couples who are trying it out, like for the first time, it\ntends to get a little haywire. There's some excitement in the beginning. Everybody's really excited about it. I think the philosophy makes\nsense to a lot of people. The science of it makes\nsense to a lot of people. But we have been raised in a society that is pretty monogamous, so there isn't a lot of\nscaffolding around it. And there's a lot of\ninner conflict, I think, for people to go away from the values that they've been taught\nsince they were kids. And so jealousy arises a lot. And also, it's very difficult to be, I think, as truthful and\ndirect as you need to be, which you're describing in\nthese polyamorous situations where everybody is laid out on the table. So I think that's something\nthat may be practiced. In my own work with\nclients, I've just noticed that the partners who are happier in these situations, who I've worked with, they\nare more experienced at it. - Yeah.\n- They seem to have it down. - You testified in the Johnny\nDepp/Amber Heard trial, based on your role as a clinical\nand forensic psychologist. It was watched by, I don't\nknow how many people, maybe tens, maybe hundreds\nof millions of people. What was that experience like? - Thank God I didn't\nknow that at the time. - Were you scared?\n- Oh yeah. - Given the size of the platform, how many people are watching?\n- Well, scared typically isn't the word when I testify, I'm always excited and\na little trepidatious before I testify because\nthe stakes are so high for everybody's life in that room. This was different. Anxiety isn't usually my brand. And I just skipped anxiety that morning and went straight to terror. And I was mad. I was\nmad at the legal team. I was funny, like I was having\nall these strong emotions. I couldn't find my bobby pins. I almost started crying\n'cause I couldn't find them. I was pretty unhinged that morning, and in a way that was\nreally unfamiliar to me. And it was right when I cried 'cause I couldn't find my bobby pins, that I realized I needed to get a grip and that I was a professional\nand that my hair didn't matter even though it ended up mattering. People noticed that it was crazy. But I got a grip and I went\nin and I just did my job. - So the terror in the\nend helped you focus and do your job well? - I think it does and it's\na little scary, though, 'cause I know what fear does cognitively and there is a sweet spot\nwhere you want some stress and then you can be really\nacutely focused and attuned. But then if you go over this threshold, you get sort of that frontal lobe shutdown where you're not thinking clearly. And everybody knows that experience from taking a really\nstressful test at some point, like in high school. And then they're going over\nthe answers with the teacher in class later and they're like, \"How did I miss that\nquestion? I know that.\" You're just in a different state. That's when you have too much stress. I think this day I actually was bordering on too much stress, if not\nclearly in that threshold. But once you're sitting\nthere for a little bit and you're asked the questions, you can kind of go into a routine of just wanting to talk about your work. - So what is the work, the job of a forensic\npsychologist in that context? - In the Depp/Heard trial, I was serving as an expert witness based on a psychological\nevaluation of one of the parties. So forensic psychologists\ncan serve the court or in legal matters in a number of ways. They can act as a confidential consultant for an attorney on a case, or they can even assist\nwith jury selection. They might testify without\ndoing an evaluation if they're just coming to testify about sort of a subject matter. And then they wouldn't be\nanswering specific questions to either of the parties, but just talking more\nhypothetically about a field area. In this case, because I was ordered to\nconduct an evaluation, I evaluated one of the parties and then you provide a report to the court with your findings and then you testify as to what your findings were. - But from my perspective,\njust watching you, you seem to have held\nit together really well. So what do you attribute that to? So you said like it calmed\ndown after you were able to ask the question. So to me, if I were just to\nput myself in your place, it seems like the internet and the world would be very nitpicky\nabout individual words. You're speaking from a place of scientific rigor. And so you have to be very\nprecise with your wording. - Very precise.\n- I would feel like so much pressure about\neach single word I choose. Did you feel that pressure that you had to be extremely\nprecise with the words? - Always. The pressure is so high\ngoing into testifying. I think that's where I feel\nthe most pressure is preparing, and literally the moment until\nI start having to answer. And then I don't even have the luxury of thinking about myself because it is so important\nthat that answer be clarified and understandable to the court, that that becomes my focus. And that's the godsend, is\nthat I can stop thinking about how scary it all is, because I need to pay attention\nto explaining something. - So if it's okay, I\nwould love to talk to you about the Personality Assessment test. 'Cause I think it's\nactually super fascinating. - The Personality Assessment\nInventory or the MMPI-2? You're probably referring to the MMPI-2, which is one I talked a lot about. - MMPI-2. Yeah. So maybe can you explain the\nMMPI-2, seems fascinating. - It is.\n- It has like its output, the results has some basic\nskills as code types. And just reading through the different- - It's so complex. It's a thing of beauty. - Because the human mind\nis really complicated. Even, you know, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, like all of these things are really complicated. There's like, many of them\nwe don't understand well. There seems to be a\nhuge amount of variance, and yet you have to be\nable to stitch together a bunch of characteristics\nthat give you intuition about the unique aspects of each person. You want to be able to have tests that get you closer to identifying the peculiar flaws or\nbeauties of a particular mind. So this seems to do a good job. Just reading through the different- - Can I borrow that-\n- Descriptions of the code- - next time I testify? That was the best description. - I don't know I'm being\npoetic. I apologize. - But\n- No, that was a beautiful description. - You have to be in part\npoetic about the human mind. It's not math, it's psychology. Okay. So what is the MMPI-2? Like, what are we talking about here? Like, it's a questionnaire? - Yes. That's a great start. So it is a questionnaire,\nyet 567 yes/no questions. I'm gonna tell you what's most\nbeautiful about this test. So they used an empirical\nkeying method to develop it. What that means is that they didn't have a bunch of psychologists\nget together and say, \"Let's ask them, let's make\nsure that we identify people who have somatic complaints\nor physical complaints by asking them questions about\nlike numbness in their hand,\" nothing like that. What they did instead\nwas they threw, you know, like take 1,000 questions\nat a group of people who they know had a certain mental illness and a group of people who\ndidn't have that mental illness. And then they looked for patterns in what the people with\nmental illness endorsed as yes and no of those random questions. So it would be, for instance, there's a bronze light\nfixture right there. One of the questions out\nof the 1,000 might be, \"I like light fixtures that\nare bronze. True or false?\" And they looked for correlations in the way that people would answer to these completely innocuous,\njust boring questions. So there was no real way that a test taker could foresee the point of answering. - And so because they can't foresee, it's very difficult to cheat to get to a conclusion they want? - Very difficult, and not only that, but you can imagine using that approach, you can then look for patterns for almost any type of response style, for any type of personality trait, any type of mental illness. You just get a comparison group and then a group who's\nusing that specific strategy or has that specific mental illness or has that personality trait, and you just look for patterns. - And there's a scale\noutput of different kinds? - So-\n- And there's code types? - Yep, so you've got validity scales and those are just fascinating and often one of the most useful parts of this test in forensic context because they show you how a person is approaching the test, how they're answering\nquestions about themselves. So for instance, you can\nsee if they are tired, you can see if they're kind\nof responding randomly. You can see if they are in\nan unsophisticated manner trying to make themselves look\nperfect but not very nuanced. You can see if they may\nbe deceiving themselves and truly believe that they are perfect, whereas others don't see it that way. You can see if they're exaggerating. You can see if they're\nexaggerating because they're truly, it's a cry for help. They are in extreme distress, but they feel as though they\nneed to really punctuate it to get people to notice. Or you can see if they're\nexaggerating in a way that is, you know, driven for\na specific outcome or gain. It's just fascinating and it's the most well-developed\nassessment we have for a person's approach to answering questions about themselves. - So it gives you the context about- - [Shannon] How honest they're being. - the state of the person\nas they're answering them. - Yeah, yeah. Their honesty, how\nforthcoming they're being and how accurate they're being. - And then the result\nof the classification based on the tests are these code types? - Right, well, so you have\nthese clinical scales as well. You have 10 clinical scales that look for different kind of primary\nclinical pathology issues. This test doesn't tell you\nanything good about yourself. At best, it just tells you that you're not responding\nin a way that is dishonest and that you are kind,\nnot hugely problematic, but there's, you know, it's\nnot looking for strengths. So you have these 10 clinical scales that look for variations above the mean of the population in certain areas. Anywhere from, you know,\ndepressive symptoms, manic symptoms, physical complaints, anxiety, nervousness,\naggression, social engagement, a whole scope of human experience. And then there're much more\nnuanced scales from those. So little subscales. And then the real power,\nthough, of the MMPI-2 is in, as you said, these code types. And these code types\nare additional patterns that have been detected that\nreally can be more defining of a personality. So you look for peaks. There can be either two extreme\npeaks or three, typically, that make a code type. And those peaks are higher scores on these personality traits. And specific code types can\ngive you a very nuanced picture of a person's general approach to life and their personal relationships,\njust their personality. - So you can build on\ntop of those code types an understanding, yeah, of how that person's going to deal with different kinds of situation. And then there's, by the\nway, a lot of code types. - [Shannon] There are a lot of code types.\n- I was looking at them, they're pretty interesting. - It is truly fascinating.\n- I wanna take this test. I wanted to see which one I would. - [Shannon] I have given it\nto some people in my life. It's just phenomenal. - How hard is it on your side\nof the table to give the test? - Oh, it's easy. You just proctor, you just\nmake sure that somebody, there's no distraction,\nthat they're well rested. They are sitting there\nand they can just take it in front of you. - So I guess the question is, because the questions are well designed in that it's hard to mess with them. You just give the- - It's very hard to beat it.\nYou just hand it to them. - [Lex] And it's yes and no? - It's yes and no. - [Lex] Okay. - But I should also add\nto this, that this test, as much as I love it and\nit is the most researched and widely used personality\nassessment in the world, it is not in and of itself definitive. So you use it like you already\nhave sort of a hypothesis and you use this for clarification. And it has a ton of value for\nshowing somebody's response or their approach, how\nforthcoming they're being. But other than that, you\nreally need to consider it as a piece of the puzzle. You had said stitch together earlier, and that was just one\nof those points you made that was perfect for describing this. - There's probably no\none perfect test, right? For personality.\n- No. - I wonder there, especially\nwith advancements of AI, there could be more, more and more sophisticated\nways of measuring, of collecting data about your behavior. - [Shannon] Absolutely. There could be. - And being able to measure some kind of more productive kind of, especially not in a forensic context, but more in a trying to figure out like how to improve your lifestyle, improve your relationships,\nall that kind of stuff. So the results of the\ntest with Amber Heard, if you can speak to the public stuff. You said that the results\nof Ms. Heard's evaluation supported two diagnoses, borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. Can you speak to each one\nof those? What are they? What are the basic characteristics of borderline personality disorder? - Sure, well, so right now, the DSM-5, which is sort of the Bible\nfor mental disorders, it's what we go to, our Diagnostic Manual. It classifies personality\ndisorders according to clusters. And Cluster B is one that\ninvolves the emotionally erratic, interpersonally erratic\nemotional disorders. And those include histrionic\npersonality disorder, borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. Eventually, there's been\nsome research on this and a lot of support\nfor us eventually moving into a more spectrum-type approach to considering personality disorders where you'd essentially\nbe looking at dysfunction in different domains of\nsomebody's functioning that has persisted over time. And again, the really important part is, it seems to be a stable trait\npart of their personality. That person, you know, it's in their interpersonal relationships, it's in how they handle their own life, their own functioning, their mood. And it's not just situation\nbased. It seems to be all areas. I don't love the title\nhistrionic personality disorder. I think its history is, it's pretty controversial and\nthere's some misogyny in it. But that all being said, as a servant to the court\nand somebody who is there to just provide the\nscience as it exists today, my job is to relay. And in this specific case,\nI was ordered to provide my diagnostic impressions, a diagnosis. And I don't get to decide which diagnosis, whether I like a certain diagnosis or not. Ultimately if the criteria are\nmet, that diagnosis is given. So as we have it right now with the current personality\ndisorder categories, histrionic personality disorder is probably the most controversial. Some people believe that it is narcissistic personality disorder light. So sort of a less obvious, less malicious version of\nnarcissistic personality disorder. And I think that will\nprobably get sussed out if we do move to a more\nspectrum-based approach 'cause then you would be describing sort of a personality disorder and then you would add the traits to it. So, you know, with issues\nin interpersonal functioning and et cetera. So you could be a little bit more specific rather than having to just\nput somebody in a category. - So that's where things\nare moving, you're saying? - That's where things-\n- Things are kinda clustering. - [Shannon] are moving. - From clusters based\nview of NPD, antisocial personality disorder-\n- To more of a spectrum with personality dysfunction, then you list the traits that are there and I think that'll be more accurate. Especially there's so much overlap between these personality\ndisorders right now, especially Cluster B, it is not uncommon for\npeople to have two or three personality disorders to meet criteria for two or three at the same time. So speaking about borderline\npersonality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. Borderline personality\ndisorder can best be thought of as a disorder of instability\nand impulsiveness, emotional instability, instability in a person's\nself-identity, sense of self. Instability in a person's relationships. And then underlying all of this is an intense fear of abandonment. Histrionic personality\ndisorder is more of a disorder of emotionality, dramatics\nand attention seeking. This, you know, histrionic disorder typically is known for the dramatics. And people who are observing\nor interacting with somebody with this disorder may\neven feel themselves almost kind of wanting to turn away. There's a sense of play acting\nas the person is speaking or engaging with you. Something just feels a\nlittle bit disingenuous and a lot of attention seeking. Similar to borderline\npersonality disorder, you might see with histrionic\npersonality disorder attempts to manipulate. However, the motivation with\nhistrionic personality disorder is that attention, whereas with borderline\npersonality disorder, the underlying motivation\nfor almost everything is to avoid abandonment. So you'll see frantic\nattempts to avoid abandonment, frantic attempts to keep people close. And those frantic attempts\ncan be really harmful to the person and to others. - To the person themselves?\n- Mm-hmm. - (sighs) So the fear of abandonment can result in the very\nthing you're afraid of. - Right, and there has\nbeen some research also to suggest that borderline\npersonality disorder has different types as well. And I think this is really\nimportant because in my own work, I have encountered many people with borderline personality\ndisorder, in my own life, right? And there are different types, right? I'm thinking specifically\nof a girl I really love who I've worked with for years, who is so self-aware\nabout this and endearing and she owns her shit. I can forgive almost anything if somebody just owns their shit. She might lose her temper,\nshe might lash out. She can be erratic, but she\nwill come back and apologize, own it and accept full responsibility. And not only that, but\nidentify it and make changes. She doesn't want to be harmful. I adore that about her. I think it's an admirable\nquality more of us could have. That's very different than\nwhen you think about it, there are nine different symptoms and you only need five to meet criteria. So depending on which symptoms you have, you might be far more calculated,\nconniving, manipulative, or you may just be more of the impulsive, kind of messy, emotionally erratic type. And so there's some new\nresearch also coming out that's even suggested that among women, those that score higher in some of these more calculated traits of\nthe disorder may actually be, it may be a certain presentation\nof female psychopathy. Yeah.\n- Are some of these personality disorders, again, probably impossible\nquestion to answer, but how much of it is nature,\nhow much of it is nurture, or how much of it is in the genetics and you just can't do much with? Maybe another question, a\ndifferent way to ask that is how much can you help that? How much can you become better? - That is a tough question. So there's been a ton of change in the way we've thought\nabout the etiology of these personality disorders. Specific to borderline\npersonality disorder, I think in general the\nview is that most people believe that it was\nassociated with neglect or trauma in childhood. While there is a correlation there, there's a correlation between that and many mental health issues, not just borderline personality disorder. We also, there is evidence to support a genetic basis for this\npersonality disorder. And there are people who have borderline personality disorders that report no childhood\ntrauma or difficulty. And I have seen, you know, sometimes things just happen,\nso I think it's a mix. I think we need to think\nof it as bio-psychosocial, which is generally the\nanswer to most things when you're talking about how a mental health issue comes to be. I certainly think that in most cases, and here's just me\nspeaking personally, again. I think in my own work, in most cases what I see\nis that somebody may have some sort of predisposition, then they go through certain life events and learn patterns of behaving\nthat may serve them well as a child in a dysfunctional situation, but end up being very\nproblematic later on. Or they just have enough\nhardship that that gene, whatever it was lying dormant, that little borderline\npersonality disorder gene expresses itself. And you'll see that with\nthings like schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders. There tend to be certain ages where you'll just see\n(imitates bomb exploding) that expression happen. - All right, for the\nrecord, it got cold in here. So we upgraded with a blanket. (both laughing) You look cozy. Just as a question for me,\njust observing the trial, it was interesting that first of all it was a really raw and honest exploration of a intimate relationship\nbetween two people. - Oh yeah.\n- It was interesting to watch, I suppose I haven't\nwatched that kind of thing. It made me think about what\nmakes for a good relationship, all the many things we've\nalready talked about in this conversation. It was useful for that. But also there was raw recordings of two humans' interaction. What'd you think about that,\nthat there's recordings? It's kind of interesting. - The act of recording your partner? - Yeah, not the ethics of that or so on, but the fact that you have this data. It made me wonder, like if I recorded myself,\nhow would I sound like? - [Shannon] Well, you do record yourself. - No, but here with microphones. But when you're in private.\n- Yeah. - You wonder, like I had a bit of a fight\nwith a friend last week and I wondered which one\nof us was the asshole. I would love to hear the recording 'cause we were a little bit, I think we were a little\nbit rude to each other. And I wonder how it went wrong. What-\n- I love that you asked yourself that\nquestion, that's so useful. - We made up the next day and we, I think both agreed to\nnot ever talk about it, (both laughing) but I want the data. - Just bury it deep.\n- Yeah. - You know, I record my couple sessions and one of the primary purposes\nof that is so that after, if they start to get nasty\nwith each other in the session, I can stop it and I can\nsay, \"What was that,\" right? And most of the time that\nwhat you're describing is so useful because\nwe don't see ourselves, we have no idea that we\njust came off as critical. We think we're being completely\nreasonable and thoughtful. You know, whenever somebody is\nsort of retelling an argument they got in, they said,\n\"And then, you know, I was just caring and just asked, I mean, why, is there a reason you did?\" You know, something like that. If they can actually see\nthemselves, they realize, no, their jaw was clenched,\ntheir voice was raised. They actually called a name.\nSometimes they're shocked. - So just a quick, just to linger on it, you labeled Amber Heard\nas a 3-6 code type. Going back to our discussion,\nwhich can mean that quote, \"She's heavily concerned with image, prone to treating others with cruelty, unable to admit\nresponsibility for wrongdoing and prone to externalizing blame.\" And then I also went into the MMPI-2 list. 3-6 includes anxiety, tension, rigidity, fear of criticism,\nsuppressed hostility, merging in passive or episodic aggression, suspiciousness, egocentricity, what else? Projection. What can you say about that\ncode that it's not captured in the different personality disorders? What are we supposed to do that from a forensic psychology perspective? And what are we supposed\nto do that in general, forget the 3-6, in general, these kinds of code types in that context, in the context of a trial? - If I'm understanding you correctly, it's sort of what's the\npoint of these code types? - Yeah. Thank you for\nasking the question better. I don't know what I'm\ndoing. I'll just sit. I just actually honestly\nreally find MMPI-2 fascinating. - I love that you do. I love that you get it because I just, to me it's such a, it's almost unbelievable\nthat humans created it. But I think that goes back\nto that empirical key method of creating something\nthat enabled it to be as robust as it is, and\nsomething that is very difficult to beat, if not impossible. But the code types\nreally, so it depends on, in any forensic case, what really matters is\nthe psycho legal question. So what is the legal question? And then what is the\npsychologist's responsibility in assisting with whatever\nquestion they're being asked? And there's some\nquestions we can't answer, some that we can. You don't always need\nto provide a diagnosis when you're asked to provide a report. It depends on the jurisdiction,\nit depends on the statute. Some jurisdictions actually\nrequire a diagnosis. In this case, I was asked\nto provide a diagnosis. So when I'm considering a diagnosis, you're integrating\nmultiple different sources of information. You're integrating an\nexaminee's self-report, you are adding collateral data, usually. I wasn't able to obtain collateral\ninterviews in this case. And that was the decision of the court. They said no collateral interviews, but typically, that would be\nsomething that you would add. You're looking at records,\nideally from birth up until the date that the\nalleged injury occurred. And I'm speaking now specifically to a personal injury evaluation where something, where\nsomebody is claiming that they were harmed psychologically. But you want as many records as possible to show how a person functioned\nbefore that event occurred and how they functioned after. And you want it to show\nfinancial functioning, physical functioning,\nacademic functioning. Basically, where is there evidence that something in their life changed? Where is there evidence that harm occurred other than from what they're telling you? And in addition to all of those records that you're reviewing, in\naddition to their self-report, then you're also going to\ngive some of these tests like the MMPI. So the code types are really\nthat strength of the MMPI-2, it gives you really nuanced information about a person's personality. Now again, you're not gonna use the MMPI-2 or any other test by itself to diagnose someone or, you know, decide that the person\nis telling the truth, not telling the truth. It is just another piece of data. And when it's working\nthe way it's supposed to, it lines up really nicely with all of the other data you're getting, including what you've\nobserved from the person during your interview with them, the information they're giving you or inconsistencies with the\ninformation they're giving you, the consistency or inconsistency\nof their self-report from the records, what the\nrecords themselves say, et cetera, et cetera. - So it's adding, it's helping\nyou clarify and clarify and clarify the picture you have of the person.\n- Yep, just dialing it down more and more. You're just making sure that\nit is as accurate as possible. - Okay, so given how huge this trial was, given how eloquent you were, I know you don't think of it that way, but from a public perspective, you are like the star\nbecause of how well you did. - That's insane.\n- It's, I mean, you know? - I'm pretty sure Camille's the star. - Camille's also incredible. I've gotten a chance to interact with her. She's somebody that really inspires me by how good she's at her job,\nhow much she loves her job, and how much the fame,\nthe money, whatever, has not affected the basic\ncore integrity of who she is as a human being, so\nshe's also incredible. Okay, what's the takeaway for\nyou personally from the trial? How has it made you a better person? How's it changing, changed or solidified who you are as a psychologist, as a forensic psychologist,\nclinical psychologist and so on? - Wow, I mean a lot happened\nin my life around that trial, leading up to the trial, after the trial. So let's tackle forensic\npsychologists first. - Sure.\n- Okay. So in terms of forensic psychology, I am grateful to that trial for really strengthening my abilities. The stakes were so high\nthat I took, you know, I was retained about two\nyears prior to the trial. So I really delved deep\ninto the academic side of forensic psychology and making sure that I was adhering as closely as possible to standard practices, best\npractice recommendations for this specific type of an examination. It was intellectually\nawesome and challenging. I felt like my brain was\non fire for a full year leading up to the trial, and\nthat can be really, really fun. It was just challenging. But I am really proud of the work I did. I think the stakes were really\nhigh. It's serious work. It's important that it's\ndone well and accurately, and I felt really good about it. - So have some of those\nlessons carried through to your practice now to both research and some of the things you're doing in terms of helping couples? - No, I mean, as you know, my practice hasn't changed that much. This was more just\nsomething that was more, it demanded so much more of my time than my typical forensic work does. And personal injury cases, or in cases where there\nis an allegation of trauma or psychological harm tend\nto be super labor intensive. This, given the magnitude and how long it had been going\non and the back and forth, required a ton of work\nbefore the trial as well. So it pulled me away from the practice. I think it's been nice to\ngo back a bit if, okay, so now personally, I've\nlearned some things. I've learned that I need\nto slow down a little bit. - So this took a lot from you? - It took a lot. But it\nwas really the culmination. I feel like there are\nthese hoops we jump through again and again, you know, academic challenges\nthat we continue to meet and then there's a next one\nand a next one and a next one. And in the beginning, like when\nyou're getting into college or applying to grad schools, you don't really realize this is going to be a never ending thing. Especially if I continue with research. Forensic work, I love it\nbecause it is so academic. You know, you're writing\nthese 75-page reports and with citations and\nyou have to be accurate. It feels like a doing giant board exams again and again and again, it never ends. But that feeling, I think\nyou and I were talking about how it's fun to doubt\nyourself because it pushes you to do better work. So if you keep having high stakes, you're going to work all the time, work yourself into the ground, constantly be thinking\nabout, oh this question, I'm not sure if I fully know the answer and all the research behind\nthat, so I should go there. And again, super fun. But I don't just do\nforensic psychology all day. I also own a clinic. I provide therapy. I've been\nproviding therapy for 15 years. So what happens is you have clients who maybe you've stopped seeing, but when they have a\ncrisis in their lives, they reach out to you again,\neven if it's seven years later. So you've accumulated 100s of clients who at any given time are gonna reach out when they're in crisis, whether or not you're\nworking on a federal case or in Virginia for this. And that is never going to be\nsomething easy to grapple with because I feel that I am\nletting somebody down. I know I am because these are\npeople I genuinely care about and they care about me and they trust me and I wanna be able to be there for them. I know that it's\ndisappointing if I can't be. And it's also very\ndifficult to separate out the professional therapy relationship from loving someone\nwho you've seen through some of the most difficult\nparts of their lives. And I can explain that\nto people all day long, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's gonna be easy\nfor someone to accept when I can't talk to them. And they just found out, you know, their husband was leading\na double life or, you know, their sister just died and\nI can't even get on a call because I am getting maybe\n15 messages like that a day, and have to testify and\nhave to run my practice. So I think that was why\nI need to slow down. This case, I was doing all of that, and then like the academic\nload or the work involved was just tremendous. And some stuff happened. Like my dad, he started\nhaving his cognitive decline. I got a medical diagnosis\nthat is stress-induced. I really thought I was\ngetting away with it. I really believed that people who talked like a lot about self-care\nwere kind of full of shit and just didn't know\nhow to push themselves. I still believe in pushing ourselves, but I think I kind of\ntraversed into an area without realizing it, where I\nwas no longer pushing myself to challenge myself or\nsee what I was capable of, I was almost pushing\nmyself like as a necessity 'cause I didn't know\nwhat else to do anymore. Just an obligation. It wasn't even, yeah. I wasn't pushing myself to do, the Depp/Heard case\nreminded me of that feeling of pushing myself to do something I wasn't sure I was capable of and overcoming that\nchallenge, that was rewarding. But when you're piling that on\nwith like running a business and all these other things\nand trying to be perfect at all of them, that just starts to become like a feeling of necessity\nand it's not healthy. - That said, you somehow\nmanage to hold it all together to put forward a masterful\nperformance and like you said, still take care of all these clients 'cause you're the most\nimportant person in their lives for many of them. Is there a secret to\nthat? Is there any hacks? Is is there- - I don't sleep a lot. I don't get a... No. And honestly, it's\nnot 100, it's not... It's a work in progress, right? I don't have an answer for, I wouldn't want my life\nto be any other way. You know, I wouldn't\nhave had the opportunity to work on this case if I\nhadn't established my practice and had outreach. And so I can't figure out like\nwhich piece you take it out without it all crumbling. But I would love to have\na little more downtime. - So it all kind of works together. And this passion is the fuel that's behind all of it, probably. That's probably the reason you haven't lost your mind quite yet. - Maybe, yeah, maybe. Unless, I mean, it depends who you ask. (both laughing) - What about the stress of\njust being in the public eye? Has that been difficult for you? - That's a lovely question,\nthank you for asking it, 'cause it is nice to\ntalk to you about this 'cause I feel like you probably\nunderstand it a little bit. That was something I was\nabsolutely unprepared for. Like I said, I had no idea\nhow many people were watching when I testified, I had no idea. And I got off the stand, I kind of staggered to the back room and truly thought about\nlying down on the floor 'cause I was so exhausted. And, you know, I'd been\nup studying all my stuff, terrified that I was gonna\nforget some statistic about the MMPI-2. - It's gonna be so\ngreat. It's great for me. It's gonna be great for\npeople to hear this, that you're human, your two flaws, (both laughing) that's extremely stressful\nfor many, many hours. I wondered how you can sit\nthere for so many hours and stay so focused and listen\nso well, it's so difficult. - Well, I mean, I could\ntalk about that too. The moment I came to almost like, came back to my body\nand realized where I was and just wanted it to stop and felt like I was burning alive. I just was thinking, I\ndon't wanna do this anymore. I don't wanna do this\nanymore. Is this gonna stop? And then another question came and I just had to get back to it. But so after I testified the first time, I went in that back room, I might have laid down on the ground. It's kind of a blur. I mean, I might have. I do remember that Wayne Dennison, one of the senior managing\npartners at Brown Rudnick, who is a phenomenal guy\nand absolutely brilliant. I will be indebted to him for\nlife because I trusted him. I trusted him. And that made all the difference in probably how I testified. But he came in the back and\nhe was looking at his phone and he said, \"You're on\nthe cover of 'Time.'\" Something on, you know, like Apple news. And I thought, I mean I really, I thought he was messing with me. I thought it was his\njoke way of saying like, I did great. - You've worked with veterans. What is PTSD in the that context? What's the landscape of\npsychological sufferings that veterans soldiers go through? (Shannon sighing) - Well, if we're talking\nabout combat exposure, you're seeing things\nyou're not meant to see. You're seeing the worst of humanity. People harming other people. It's not natural for others\nto intend to harm us. It's not natural for us to harm others. And this dehumanization can\noccur that's so troubling and disturbing that\npeople have a hard time living with it later. Or they just feel this ongoing anger. It depends, it depends on the\ntrauma they're exposed to. It depends on, you know, whether their convoy\nwas ambushed by weapons that were purchased from money that was given to this village\nfrom the US government. It depends on whether they did something that they have a hard time\nreconciling outside of war, now that they're back\nhome in civilization. Depends on whether they\nlost a lot of their comrades and feel that guilt of being a survivor. And again, not everybody develops PTSD. It really, it's a mental\ndisorder, it's serious. We talk so much about trauma and PTSD gets thrown around lightly, when actually it's very difficult to meet the full criteria\nfor that diagnosis. And many people experience\nsevere trauma in their lives and only about 14% are likely\nto actually develop PTSD. It's an exception, not the norm. Traumatic stress is absolutely normal. After something traumatic happens, you'll likely have nightmares,\nyou'll likely have anxiety, you'll feel depressed\nbecause you're a human being and something abnormal happened. But PTSD is a longer-standing condition that is significantly\nimpairing in a person's life. And I think we've lost that in some of the sort of narrative in society. It just, everybody has PTSD, but no, you can have traumatic\nstress, you can be distressed, you can be affected by trauma and not have that particular diagnosis. PTSD significantly impairs people's lives. - How do veterans, how do soldiers who suffer from PTSD or are close to that kind\nof diagnosis begin to heal? What's the path for healing? - Well, I will hand it to the military because I think in terms of working with their active\nduty service members, they really invest\nheavily in mental health. The US Department of\nDefense was one of the first to bring animal-assisted therapy into any type of treatment\nin the early 1900s with bringing, you know,\nfarming into certain hospitals and letting veterans help with the farms and brush the horses, which is so advanced because now we have all this research on animal-assisted therapy\nand how beneficial it is. And just looking in the eyes of a dog can increase your pain threshold and speed healing after a cardiac arrest. Help people with dementia\nto ambulate more freely. It's incredible stuff, simple. And the military was\nahead of the game on that. And I don't think that's changed. I did my training at a\nmilitary hospital in Hawaii, Tripler Army Medical Center, it was phenomenal training and, you know, our psych department, there was so much\ninteresting research going on and it was so integrated. So you might not imagine that the military would be doing this, but we\nhad an acupuncture department, we had a chiropractic department,\nwe had a yoga section, we were doing yoga sessions there. I mean, anything that has\nevidence to support its efficacy was being utilized. And I think that's pretty\ncool about our government. They have a lot of funding so I'm glad they're using it on that. The real challenge I think\ncomes with the large scale need at the veteran population, and they slip through the cracks. I know that the DOD had a campaign going where they were doing outreach\nto anybody who served, for instance in the Vietnam War. The problem is they were trying to get all of these people assessed\nfor PTSD and it was great. Like, they were getting phone calls, mail, it was sort of saying, \"Hey,\nwe know that you served, come on in. Or let's schedule you an\nexam with a psychologist and just see if you're owed benefits.\" The idea of it's great. The problem is that they outsourced to this third-party company. They're paying really low\nrates for a one-hour meeting with a vet. And you don't need to\nbe specifically trained in assessing PTSD. And so you're getting these\nvariations and opinions that are coming through. And I've had clients who, to me, who I've worked with for years, who have clear combat-related PTSD according to gold standard measures, according to my knowing them\nand observing their symptoms and how impaired they are. And it is clearly associated with combat, the content of their intrusive thoughts, their nightmares, et cetera. And they are having a one-hour meeting sometimes by phone with\none of these psychologists who's been contracted by this\nthird-party organization. That's not even enough\nfor me to get through the first through few symptom questions on the CAPS-5 assessment for PTSD. But in that hour the\npsychologist is saying, \"Definitively, no PTSD.\" And it's been a travesty for some people, especially for those who\nneed an advocate the most. It tends to happen to my veterans who are maybe a little\nbit less sophisticated in presenting or\nadvocating for themselves, more humble, less, you know, the guys who need deserve\nit the most, right? They're just getting passed\nover and it's a maze. I'm not quite sure what\nthe solution is, though, before, I mean I've worked\nfor government agencies. It's a massive population. I love that the outreach is even happening and trying to get these\nguys in for assessment. I think we can criticize any system. I'm glad that system is even happening, but it still needs to be better. - So I've gotten to a chance to interact with a lot of soldiers that\nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan. And now a lot of soldiers from all different kinds\nof nations in Ukraine, went to the front. There's a bond between\nsoldiers unlike any other. I don't know if you can speak\nto, why do you think that is? On the opposite side of PTSD, there's a deep human connection, there's like a love for each other. What is that? What is that about war and combat that creates that kind of- - Well you're seeing, we talked earlier about\nthat vulnerability, right? So I believe that combat, I believe that most survival situations strip away all ego and, I mean, there are a couple\ndifferent layers to this, but I have not served in war. So I wanna be cautious here. But from what I know just about psychology and also from my own\nexperience of survival, survival-type experiences, when you're with a group of people and all the egos stripped\naway, nothing else matters. The focus is on the here and now and a specific mission or your day-to-day, you can get really close. You're very, very vulnerable. And also in my experience, the guys I work with who have served, there aren't a lot of people who understand what they've been through. Not only some of the unspeakable things they've been through in combat, but some of the things that they feel are unspeakable about returning, especially if they are\nexperiencing trauma. A lot of them, you know, some of the things that\nservice members with PTSD are the most reluctant to disclose is the feeling like they may not know if they love their children\nanymore or their wife, that they don't even know\nif they can love anymore. That they feel emotionally numb. That they wanna kill someone. That they have a whole lot of\nracist beliefs and thoughts. There are a lot of things that can be associated with PTSD that aren't as clear or expected. And these guys don't have many people who understand it or they\ndon't think they would, but a lot of their fellow\nservice members do. - Man, so I'm going back to Ukraine and boy, nothing makes, nothing reveals the human condition in a more pure form than war. - [Shannon] Hmm. - Especially the kind of war you get in that part of the world. Especially the war in Ukraine, which is a very 20th century kind of war. - Mm-hmm. Brutal. - (sighing) Well like I mentioned\nin a few different ways, you're exceptionally\nsuccessful by, I think, the best definition of success. You're doing what you love and\nyou're one of the best people in the world that doing it. And so what advice-\n- Thank you. - would you give to young\npeople that look up to you, that saw you in the trial, which is your most public facing thing, and are just looking, young people that are looking\nto find what they wanna do with their life career-wise or? - I love that question. - What would you tell them? - I'm gonna tell them\nsomething my dad told me. He said to me, \"Shannon,\njust pick anything. Pick anything. If you like it at all\nstudying it, just pick it.\" He was like, \"Look, don't\nworry about the job. You don't even know all\nthe jobs that exist. Pick something you like,\nyou will make it your own.\" And that is exactly what happened. I like psychology. I was\nreading some self-help books. It's not like I had this\ncalling where I, you know, looking back I can\nactually create that story 'cause I think now it makes a lot of sense that I do what I do. But I was lost and scared. I started studying psychology. I met a professor who\nwas really inspiring, who wasn't even a psychology professor, but he was public policy. I stayed in touch with that professor. He is a dear friend still to this day. That was 20 years ago. We do research together in Mexico, integrative research with, you know, public policy officials and\nenvironmental engineers. And I get to be the\npsychologist on the trip. I never ever dreamed that that\nsort of stuff could happen. I didn't know about forensic psychology. I also wanna warn anybody who's interested in forensic psychology that it's not like you're like solving crimes all day and getting calls by the FBI. You are going to be sitting\nalone in your home office with your husband bringing\nyou like bowls of cereal and reminding you to go to the bathroom 'cause you haven't gotten\nup in like 24 hours from the computer, and you're gonna have\npapers all around you. And you're just gonna write 75 dense pages with citations of like science. It's brutal, it's academic- - But you're gonna love it. - But it's fulfilling. My friend Frannie posted\na meme of one of the girls from \"Glee\" or something,\ncrying and saying like, \"I'm the happiest I've ever been.\" And she said, it reminds her\nof when I try to convince her to do forensic psych, 'cause I think her mind is perfect for it. You have to be strategic and thorough. But it's a slog. But it's wonderful. It's wonderful. - The image of your\nhusband bringing you cereal while you work on the 75 pages is maybe the most romantic\nthing I've ever heard. So we started on love. Let me ask one last question\nabout the same topic. What's the role of love\nin this whole thing, in the human condition, in this whole experiment\nwe've got going on on Earth? - I think it's all there\nis, like that Jewel song. - [Lex] How's that go? - God, I don't, don't sing it. Don't sing it. Don't get it in my head. - [Lex] Please don't sing it. - There have been some\nprofound moments in my life where I feel like I am closest to kind of the truth of\nlife or what it's all about. And usually, there's this\nresonating sense of love and ease and love for myself,\nlove for other people. Sort of like it's all\nokay, we're all okay. We're gonna get through this. I liked what you said about\nthe harm caused by like the misinformation or negative\nthings being said about you because you're right, it\nharms that bigger picture. I think it holds us back,\ntakes us back from that truth. - That there's a love\nthat connects all of us. And that if you remember about that love, it's all going to be okay. I really hope it's going to be okay. - Me too.\n- I believe it will be. Thank you so much for\ntalking today, Shannon. - Thank you.\n- You're an incredible person. Thank you for everything-\n- You are too. - you do, and for everything you stand for and from everything from your text message to just who you are and for\nthis amazing conversation. - Thank you. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Shannon Curry.

And now let me leave you some more words from Charles Bukowski. \"Sometimes you climb\noutta bed in the morning and you think, 'I'm not gonna make it,' but you laugh inside, remembering all the\ntimes you felt that way.\" Thank you for listening. I\nhope to see you next time."
