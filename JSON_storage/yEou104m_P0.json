      "text": "- There's two people in the back, two of her homegirls,\nwearing like shiesty masks. I'm like, what are we\ndoing? Where are we going? And she goes, \"We're\ngonna go film the riot. We're going to Lake Street.\" And so, we drive down there, Kmart is burning, Target is\nburning, everything is on fire. She has the Sony A7. She gives me a microphone and she's like, \"Go talk to that guy.\" And that was the guy with a\nMolotov cocktail in his hand who had just burned Kmart down. And so, I go, what should I ask him? She goes, \"What's on your mind?\" So, I walk up to him and I'm\nlike, what's on your mind? - The following is a conversation\nwith Andrew Callaghan, host of Channel 5 on YouTube, where he does Gonzo style interviews with fascinating humans\nat the edges of society, the so-called vagrants,\nvagabonds, runaways, outlaws. From QAnon adherence to fish heads to O-Block residents, and much more. He created the documentary that I highly recommend\ncalled \"This Place Rules\" on the undercurrents that led to the January 6th Capitol riots. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast\". To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Andrew Callaghan."

      "text": "- I tried to color-match you though. Got the black and white going. I went to Walmart before this and got the Wrangler shirt with the Texas Longhorns\ntee and everything. - Is that where you shop, Walmart? - Generally, yeah. - I'm a Target man myself. - There's no way you get\nthose suits from Target. - So, you're saying it's a\nnice way to compliment a suit. - I think you go Men's\nWearhouse, if not further. - I think you would be wrong. - [Andrew] You go further. - No, the other direction. - You got that from Target? - Not Target. I was joking about Target. I like Walmart better.\n(Andrew chuckles) It just felt like a funny thing to say. (Andrew laughing) - No, it was funny. - The most expensive\nthing I own is this watch. And it was given to me as a gift. - Yeah. When I was on tour, I had\nthese $2,700 Cartier glasses that I got for a lot of money, $2,700. - Like sunglasses? - Yeah. But they're really embarrassing. - Mm-hmm.\n- But I was on tour, so I just felt like I could do anything as far as fashion choices. - Oh, yeah.\n- But looking back at pictures for myself in that era,\nI'm like, God, what- - So, that was the symbol of\nthe fame got to your head? I think so, yeah. I think\nfame getting to your head. If you spend more than\n100 bucks on sunglasses, you've officially gone off a deep- - You've crossed the line, totally. And that's where you go back\nto Walmart to humble yourself. I really love Walmart. In fact, I moved to Austin,\nbecause I was at Walmart and a lady said that I\nlook handsome in a suit. - [Andrew] Mm. - And I was like, that's\nit. I love this place. She just said it for no reason whatsoever. This older lady just looked at me and with this like genuine sweetness, just said, \"Oh, you look handsome.\" - She's not wrong, man. - Thank you. - That's part of your whole swag though. - Yeah, the suit thing. Yep. Anyway."

      "section": "Early life",
      "text": "What was the first, if you remember, first recorded interview you did? - Hmm. Well, like my first grade\nteacher, Mrs. Claudia, this is back in the day,\nlike I was telling you. We just asked her about her life in Columbia\nand stuff like that. But I didn't really get\ninto actual journalism until my ninth grade year. I had no idea I had an interest in it. Before then, I wanted to be a rapper. It's all about hip hop and meditation and picking psilocybin mushrooms in public parks and stuff like that. That's what I was into. - That's a lot. Psilocybin, meditation, rap, public parks. - Yeah. I was making\nlike conscious rap music. I was to the point where I had four dreamcatchers\nhanging above my bed. - Yeah.\n- Alex Grey painting on the wall, tapestry on the ceiling, just scribbling rhymes down all the time. - So, you said somewhere\nthat you sucked at school. - Okay, well, let's\nstep back a little bit. So, I had this amazing\njournalism course in ninth grade. - Yeah.\n- I went to an alternative high school and the teacher was named Calvin Shaw. And he was just like, I ended up taking his class all four years and he used to let me\nactually leave school. I didn't like going to school. So, he let me basically go around Seattle and do different interviews with people as long as I could come\nback by the end of the day and write a story for his class. And he'd mark me as present. So, the first article that I wrote was about the Silk Road in the deep web. (Andrew chuckles) 'Cause you know. - Yeah. Nice.\n- As a ninth grader, when I discovered the Hidden Wiki, I thought that I was really tapping into the most secret society, elite level black market in the world. And so, if you remember, they had that Hidden Wiki link\nthat was like, hire a hitman. And so, I messaged them\nand I was like, all right, I wanna get someone killed at my school. How much is it gonna cost me? - Yeah.\n- And I published my interview with the Hidden Wiki hitman, who was probably a Fed or something, but who knows?\n- Mm-hmm. - And my first article was called like, \"Inside the Deep Web: A\nConversation with a Hitman\". - That's nice.\n- Yeah. - I mean, you were fearless even then. - I was hiding behind a Tor browser, so there's not much fear to be had. - Oh. So, it was anonymous? - It was anonymous, but I\ndid publish it under my name. So, you're right. I could\nhave been in danger. - I also saw that you\ntook too many shrooms when you were young and that led you to have hallucinogen-persisting\nperception disorder, HPPD.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] Can you explain what this is? - Well, that condition is classified by persistent visual snow\nfloaters, morphing objects. I see them right now. I\nsee them all the time. - The snow is in the room. - The snow is definitely in\nthe room. It's all over you. And basically, it wasn't\nthat I took too many shrooms. I think that it was... I took about an eighth\nof cyanescens mushrooms, which are the ones that come from the earth\ninstead of cow shit. And I took an eighth of those\nat my friend Toby's house, which is a normal amount,\nbut I was in eighth grade. So, I woke up the next morning with these extreme visual distortions. And I thought that it would go away. I tried to make it go away, but there's really no cure for HPPD. It's a lifelong condition. So, it's just a matter of dealing with it and realizing that it is only visual. So, when people ask me, \"Hey, I have HPPD, how do I cope with it?\" I say, remember that every\nother sense that you have, what you can hear, what you can taste, your feet on the ground, you're still on earth, you're still here. - Well, you said it's only visual - Mm-hmm.\n- and yes, gratitude for being alive at all. - Yeah.\n- It's great. But you said that this led you into some dark psychological places like depersonalization disorder. - Yeah. Depersonalization is the\nfeeling that you are not real, but that reality still exists. Derealization is the\nidea that reality itself is an illusion created by your mind and that you're the only person alive. And that everything that your brain is projecting to your\nvisual cortex is a lie. And that you're the\nonly living human being. - Both are pretty intense. - HPPD creates both of those things. And so, when I've talked to people who have the condition,\nit's really either/or. But more than 70% of people with HPPD fall into either category. They're both coping mechanisms for the, I don't know what really happens. I talked to a researcher\nonce named Dr. Abraham. He lives in Upstate New York. He's the leading scientist\nwhen it comes to HPPD research. He's the only one who\nactually seems to care about finding a cure.\n- Uh-huh. - And the only known treatment right now is alcohol and benzodiazepines. - That's not good.\n- Right. So, alcoholism, something that came into\nmy life pretty early, alcohol abuse as a result\nof that experience, because that helps with\nthe visual symptoms. Makes some of the static go away. - Man. - [Andrew] Never tried benzos though. - So, can you explain to me\nwhere in that spectrum you are? So, do you sometimes have a sense that you're not real\n- Sometimes. - and something else is not real? Like the reality's not real? - Yeah. I experience it all the time. But like I said, my job helps with that, because I get to feel like I'm, when you seek out extremes\nto a certain extent and you put yourself on the\nfront lines of intense events, whether it be politically or socially, or just dive into deep fringe subcultures, you get this feeling that you're real. And being filmed is also confirmation, if you can look at the MP4 file that you're in fact living here on earth. - Confirming\n- Yeah. - that you are in it with reality by watching\nyourself on video. - [Andrew] Exactly. - So, is that basically the engine behind all the extreme\ninterviews you've done? - Well, I got HPPD around the same time that I began this journalism\ncourse in ninth grade. So, I always used journalism as a therapeutic mechanism to deal with some of these symptoms,\nespecially depersonalization. There's some pretty good illustrations of what it feels like. Kinda feels like you're\ntrapped behind your eyes or that you're just this nebulous soul that's trapped in a flesh suit that you're not really a part of. You're puppeteering a\nflesh and bone skin suit. - Trapped or just the ability\nto step outside of yourself? - You feel like your soul is not something that is\nconnected to your body. It's something living in your head. It's really hard to explain to people who haven't gone through\nderealization or depersonalization, but if you go on support\ngroups, they always say like, \"How do I break free from behind my eyes?\" Like dark stuff like that.\n- Oh, so you're trapped. There's a higher state of being through meditation that you\ncan step outside of yourself, but this is not that.\n- Mm-hmm. Unfortunately, it was the\nkind of meditative path or the eastern path that I took and fused that with\npsychedelic culture in Seattle that took me down the psychedelic use rabbit\nhole in the first place. So, (chuckles) I'd say it all\nstarted with \"Siddhartha\". - \"Siddhartha\". That's a good book. Have you done shrooms since then? - No, I don't really do psychedelic drugs, but a lot of people think\nthat I'm against them, which I'm not, just doesn't work for me. If it works for you, I'm\nsure they can be really fun. Especially, I know there's\nlots of like therapeutic uses for acid and ketamine and psilocybin, but I personally abstain\nfrom those kind of... Anything psychotropic,\nI try to stay away from. - Drinking a bit? - Well, yeah, I didn't drink at all before I had the HPPD stuff and I would've drank later in life, but definitely like 14, 15, every day after school, I'd\ndrink a 40 ounce of Mickey's. It kinda looks like Olde\nEnglish, but the bottle's green and it has a hornet on the side of it. Just became a ritual just to deal with the\nanxiety of that situation. - And it made the snow go away? - Yeah. Alcohol really works\nto suppress HPPD symptoms. - So, you said you\nhated classes in school, except that journalism class. - Okay, we need to clear this up, because on my Wikipedia\npage, for some reason, for Andrew Callaghan early life, it says Andrew hated every single class except for one.\n- Yeah. - So, I've had a bunch of\nteachers who are super cool, like this guy, Tim, my astronomy\nprofessor at ninth grade, - Yep.\n- Mrs. Zanetti, my creative writing\nteacher in sixth grade, and this really cool dude\nat my college in New Orleans named Charles Cannon, who taught me a class called\nNew Orleans Mythology, - Mm-hmm.\n- my three favorite classes besides my journalism class, and they all hit me up and they're like, \"Hey, man, saw you said you hated every class.\n(Lex laughing) - Except the journalism.\n- Sorry I couldn't be everything that you wanted me to be.\"\n- Yeah. - And so, I just wanna say,\nshout out to all those teachers. I didn't hate every class. The point that I was making is that being forced into the\ninstitution of school so young and having to take common\ncore classes like biology, dissecting frogs, history\nof the Han Dynasty, stuff like that that I\ndidn't want to learn, but I had to learn multiple times. I learned about the dynastic\ncycle in ancient China three separate times at\nthree different schools. And I was like, who is writing this curriculum?\n(Lex laughing) And why is it so important\nthat I understand this process? - Yeah. - The part that makes school difficult, especially in college,\nis that you have people just going to school\njust to get the degree who don't really know exactly\nwhat they're interested in. And they don't even have\ntime to figure that out, 'cause they're in a business program or a communications program\nwith no specific interest. - Well, I think if you\nwanna do school right, take on every single subject\nthat you're forced into. It's like the David Foster Wallace, - Mm-hmm.\n- just be unborable by it. - Mm-hmm.\n- Just really go in as if ancient Chinese dynasties are the most interesting thing\nyou could possibly learn. - And it is somewhat interesting, the Silk Road and the Great Wall and terracotta, the soldiers and stuff. But I'm just saying like,\nwhen I got to college, I signed up for journalism school. And I didn't get to take a media class until the second semester. And I had to take everything prior to that and I'd already spent so much time. I just think the excruciating boredom of schooling left a bad taste in my mouth. - Yeah.\n- But there was individual classes that I liked a lot. - Yeah, there should be some choice or maybe a lot of choice even\nat the level of high school for what kind of\n- Mm-hmm. - classes you pursue. - Yeah, for sure. - And you're also saying, so Wikipedia is not\nalways perfectly right? - No, but it's just interesting, because I've said so much in podcasts, but that's what they isolated.\n- Mm-hmm. - And I've gotten that question before, which I understand it's the first thing on my Wikipedia page, but it makes me sound like a super hater. Have you ever seen\n(Lex laughing) this Instagram page\ncalled depthsofwikipedia? - [Lex] Oh, it's great. - Oh, it's so good, dude. - You said you love journalism. What did you love about\njournalism? What hooked you? - On a basic level, everybody\nwants media coverage, right? Everyone likes to be on camera and get exposure for\nwhatever they're doing. And so, being a journalist and being a almost like a\nportal for exposure for people allows you to be on the front row of everything that you\nwant to be a part of. You get to be in the front row for history as it's unfolding, because\neveryone wants to be covered. So, being a journalist gives you a ticket to everywhere that you wanna go in life. And so, it allows you to step into different realities almost and then go back to yours. And it just keeps life interesting. - \"Buy the ticket, take the\nride,\" Hunter S. Thompson. Is he up there as one of the influences? Who are your influences? - I think the early\n\"Daily Show\" was so good. Sacha Baron Cohen, huge influence. That was like... \"Da Ali G Show\" especially. I think Louis Theroux's\nbroadcast on BBC were great. I was really into Hunter S. Thompson too, but not really until college. - Mm-hmm.\n- I really like a particular Hunter S. Thompson book called \"The Great Shark Hunt\", where he covers the Ruben\nSalazar murder by LAPD or LA Sheriff's Department\nin Boyle Heights in the '70s. And his relationship with\nhis lawyer, Oscar Acosta, and that whole saga is great. \"Fear and Loathing\" I like, but not as much as his\nstraightforward reporting. 'Cause there's the Gonzo side of Hunter where he is saying he's\ntaking drugs and seeing shit. And there's the other side of him, which is an actual reporter interested in telling a\nstory that's has news value. So, it's two different lanes for him. - There is something about\nyou that makes people want to say you're the Hunter S. Thompson of this generation.\n- Mm. - And I don't think they mean the drugs. I think they mean some kind\nof non-standard willingness to explore the extremes of humanity - [Andrew] Mm. - and like almost a celebration\nof the extremes of humanity. - Yeah. Well, that's a\nvery kind comparison. I'll get there one day maybe. I just went to Aspen on a little Hunter S. Thompson recon trip to go check out the Woody Creek Tavern, which is the spot that he, it was like his bar near his cabin. And it was pretty cool to see. Unfortunately, it's turned\ninto not a dive bar now, but it's a sit-down country restaurant. But it was cool. But I expected to see a bunch of gnarly Hunter S. Thompson types doing speed.\n(Andrew drowns out Lex) - Doing s... (Andrew and Lex laughing) It's doing drugs. Drugs and alcohol is\nall part of it somehow. - [Andrew] Yeah. - So, It opens a gateway to a deeper understanding of humanity. - But I will say though, as someone now who doesn't party like I\ndid when I was younger, it's not as important as I\nthought it was, you know? - Yeah. I'm conflicted on this. I'm good friends with a lot of people that say alcohol is really bad for you. - [Andrew] Mm. - And I believe that too. But there's something\nthat, as an introvert, as a person who has a lot of anxiety, for me, alcohol has opened doors of just opening myself\nup to the world more. - Oh, I'm actually a fan of\nalcohol, moderate drinking. But I'm saying like, my life before, I would\nsay 2019, 2018 especially, there was the chaos on camera, but then there was my private life, which was chaotic partying all the time. - [Lex] Oh, I see. - And I convinced myself\nmuch like Hunter did that that was\n- Sure. - the secret sauce that in the core, in my spiritual core\n- Yeah. - that gave me the creativity. But then, I cut out a lot of that stuff and I'm just as creative. And it's interesting that a lot of, I think one of the hardest\nparts about addiction is that if you're a functioning, highly creative addict of any kind, your brain and the\naddictive part of your brain convinces yourself that it's\nall part of the cross purpose. And that it has this symbiotic, inspirational thing going on. But it's not true. It can be, but it's typically not. - Yeah, it's not a requirement. - [Andrew] Right. - You can sometimes channel, you can sometimes\nleverage all those things for your creativity, but the creative engine\nlives outside of that. - [Andrew] Like have you\nread Hunter's daily routine in the year up to his death?\n(Lex chuckles) It was like 15 grapefruits,\nan 8-ball of coke and just a certain\namount of shotgun shells for him to fire into the sky - Yeah, yeah.\n- every morning. There's no way, and he didn't do anything\ncreative in those final years. - [Lex] Yeah. - So, the creativity goes away and gradually you just\nbecome like a party animal. Like Andy Dick. - A caricature of yourself.\n- Yeah. - That's why life is interesting. You make all kinds of choices and sometimes you can\ncreate works of genius in a short amount of time\nbased on drugs and no drugs. Einstein had that miracle year where he published\nseveral incredible papers in one year, 1905. - Did he do drugs before that? - Lots of coke and... (Andrew laughing) - I was like, I believed you for a second.\n(Lex laughing) But I'm like, did Einstein have blow? I don't think he did. - How do you think he gets that hair? Come on.\n- It's true. - I'm just asking questions. - High confidence hair. - Look into it. Yeah.\n- You know what I mean? - Yeah. Well, no, he's a well put\ntogether, sexy young man. The hair came later.\n- Yeah. Was Albert Einstein\nattractive as a teenager? Not teenager, was he\nattractive as a young man. - Sexually attractive, or-\n(Andrew laughing) - I don't, you know-\n- I'm turned on by Einstein at all ages,\nI don't discriminate. - But are you more turned on by the work that he did\nor his physical being? - No, sometimes I fantasize what it would be like to be (coughs) in the arms of Einstein. I couldn't even get that out.\n- Yeah. In the arms of Einstein.\n(Lex laughing) - Yeah. Just, I wanna feel safe. - It's a good idea for a rom-com. (Lex laughing) - To be a little more serious, general relativity, that\nspacetime can be unified and curved by gravity is an incredibly wild and\ndifficult idea to come up with. It's a really, really\ndifficult thing to imagine, given how well Newtonian\nclassical mechanics physics works for predicting how stuff happens on earth, to think (sharply inhales) (Lex blows) like that (chuckles) gravity can morph spacetime,\n- Mm-hmm. - both space and time, and it permeates the entire universe, it's a field,\n- Mm-hmm. - it's a really wild idea to come up. As one human on earth to intuit that is really, really, really difficult. And it's really sad to me that he didn't get a Nobel Prize for that. - Was there people saying he\nwas crazy when he was around? Or was it-\n- Well, he... - Was he universally\nrecognized as an OG of this? - No, I think once the papers came out, he was widely recognized as a true genius. But before that, he wasn't recognized. He had a really difficult life.\n- So, backing up, where does a black hole go? Like after something gets sucked into it? - You mean, is it a portal to another place that kind of thing? - [Andrew] Yeah. - No. Well, we don't know. It could be that the universe is kinda like Swiss cheese\nfull of black holes. There's something called\nhawking radiation where the, because of quantum mechanics, the information leaks out of a black hole. So, it is possible to escape a black hole. There's a lot of\ninteresting questions there. - I hope we get to the bottom of that. - And there's a super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, which doesn't seem to scare\nphysicists, but it terrifies me. - Oh yeah, for sure.\nAstronomy can be terrifying. - Yeah, we're all like orbiting. We're not just orbiting the sun, but the sun is part of the solar system, is part of the galaxy and it's all orbiting\na gigantic black hole. - Have you ever spoke to someone\nwho's been to outer space? - Jeff Bezos. He flew his own rocket. - [Andrew] Wow.\n(Lex chuckles) That's pretty cool.\n- But astronaut that's been to deep space, no. - Mm. - Well, maybe I've spoken to an alien that just hasn't admitted it. - I wanna do a research paper or like a report about space madness. It's supposed to be this\ntorturous feeling that you get when you look away from\nearth and into the abyss after you've exited\nEarth's orbit or whatever. Because there's one specific psychiatrist who knows how to deal with space madness. And I wanna figure out how\nand interview people with it. - Is this a real thing? - Yes.\n- Like is there Wikipedia article on it?\n- Yes, look up space madness treatment. - Well, now, I don't trust Wikipedia after what you told me, so. - I know. They think I hate classes. - I thought you meant more about the fact that you're isolated out in space, that we need social\nconnection and it's difficult. - Yeah, I think it's just a feeling of\nextreme insignificance that you might get sometimes\nwhen you look at the night sky. But it's that times a thousand. It's like an existential void that's created after\nlooking into the abyss, and then realizing how small\nearth is in the grand scheme. You just start to really\nhave a strange new perception about the pointlessness of existence. - I don't need to go to space for that. - Only a handful of\npeople have been to space, but I'm sure they're all pretty well-off. So, the psychiatrist has\nto be in the multimillions. - Well, technically, we're all in space, 'cause earth is in space, but so, I wonder if\nyou have to go to space to talk to the psychiatrist. (Andrew chuckles) - Yeah. Probably so. - Well, technically, we're all in space, so he can't,\n- Right. - that's a boundary he can't have- - But not everyone believes that, as you've seen from my work probably. - You're right. And those are important people that are asking important questions. - Yeah."

      "section": "Hitchhiking",
      "text": "- You hitchhiked across US\nfor 70 days when you were 19. - Right.\n- Tell the story of that. - Well, this connects to\nwhat I was talking about with the boredom of school\nand these common core classes. So, after my first year of school where I lived in the dorms like a old school dormitory building at a school in New Orleans\ncalled Loyola University, I wanted to just do something. I felt so bored. I was working for the school newspaper for that whole first year. It was called \"The Maroon\". And I didn't have the ability\nto write my own stories. I had to defer to an older editor and they would give me\nstories to write about. And they were all about\nlike on campus happenings, like the Pope visits New Orleans or glass recycling to be\nrestored in the French Quarter or hoverboards banned on\ncampus due to safety concerns. And it just felt like,\n(Lex chuckles) all right, well, I wanted\nto be a Gonzo reporter. I'm not sure if working my way up through the traditional newsroom hierarchy is gonna get me to that point. So, I started reading a\nbunch of old hobo literature, like post-World War II vagabonding stuff. And there was this book\n- Yeah. - called \"Vagabonding in America\" by an old hobo Ed Buryn. And I read this and it just basically, obviously some of it was outdated. They had stuff in there\nlike the hobo code, like, oh, this moniker on the side of a fence means this person has free soup or something like that. They didn't have stuff like that. But what it did tell me-\n(Lex chuckles) - [Lex] That's great. - It told me about train\nstop towns like Dunsmuir and places in Montana where there was a friendly\nattitude toward drifters. And that still persists from\nthe '60s and '70s to this day. Even though in my opinion, movies like \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" have ruined hitchhiking\nculture in America, because now, everyone thinks you're gonna decapitate\nthem if they pick you up. So, after my final day\nof courses at Loyola, I literally left all of my\nbelongings inside my dorm and took the streetcar\nto the Greyhound station, got a one-way ticket to Baton Rouge. And I was like, I'm gonna hitchhike across the whole country back\nto Seattle with no money. And that was the plan. And it worked out. - I love it.\n- Yeah. - I traveled across the\nUnited States before in similar kind of plan. 'Cause you we-\n- Were you on the silver dog? - Sil... (Lex laughing) - The Greyhound bus. - Greyhound is pretty nice. - That's a step above hitchhiking. - Yeah, that's way\nbetter than hitchhiking. 'Cause I don't wanna-\n- Hitchhiking, Greyhound, Amtrak, airline.\n- Yeah. Amtrak, no. That's elitist. - What's in between Greyhound and Amtrak?\n(Lex laughing) A car. That's what it is. - Yeah, it's a car. Yeah. A shitty car.\n- It's a car. (Andrew laughing) - Okay, cool. - Yeah, I lived in a shitty car. - You lived in a car? - Yeah, when I was - Oh, nice.\n- driving across from the United States. Yeah.\n- Solo? - With a friend, some solo. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - And I would eat cold soup. - Mm. I love cold soup.\n- Yeah. - What I like is the\ncold chickpeas in a can. Get the water out and just dump 'em into your mouth.\n- Yeah, yeah. - Those are good, beef jerky, KIND bars. KIND bars are really good for the road. - Yeah, all of that is great, but too much of it is not great. Like too much cold soup, - Hmm.\n- not great. Too much beef jerky. - So, what was the route you took? Was it Chicago across or\nwas it Philadelphia across? - Philadelphia across. - [Andrew] To LA or where? - San Diego's and went up,\nbut it was a zigzagging. Went up to Chicago, and then\nall the way down to Texas. - So, you went Philly through\nAppalachia up to the Midwest. - Yep.\n- Did you cut over like through the southwest\ndown to San Diego? - No, no, no. It went\nstraight down to Texas. All the way down to the Midwest.\n- Okay. - So, like. (sharply inhales) - But did you cut from Texas west through New Mexico and Arizona to get to San Diego?\n- Yeah. - That is the best road trip place. - Mm-hmm.\n- Interstate 40. Like Albuquerque, Flagstaff, Vegas, Kingman, the Mojave Desert,\nYuma, doesn't get better. - Yeah, and you're\nkids, so you don't care. And you are throwing caution to the wind. And I met some crazy, crazy people. - It gives me some sanity whenever I'm feeling out\nof control or bummed out. I just remembered that the\nroad is still out there. The open road\n- Yeah. - never goes anywhere. And it's like a, I see an invisible door in the corner of the room all the time. That makes me more\ncomfortable, 'cause I'm like, hey, at the end of the\nday, if I'm bummed out, I can go hit the road and I'm sure there's\ngonna be a fun time ahead. - Yeah. Get that Greyhound ticket and go. - I would say silver dog half, because sometimes I gotta ride the dog when no one will pick me up. There's some places in the country where no one's gonna pick you up. - Yeah.\n- Kansas, Missouri, they're not gonna do it.\n- Maybe you're not charming enough. You thought about that?\n- I was 19. Fresh, clean shaven. - Yeah.\n- I was pretty charming, I'd say.\n- All right. - But the older you get, the\nharder it is to hitchhike, because they think\nyou're an escaped convict or some type of psycho wanderer. And some of these people are\nlike, what we call punishers. It's people who never stop talking. And so, they see someone hitchhiking and they're like, yes, I'm\ngonna talk at this person. - Yeah.\n- And you can tell that their eyes are wide. They're like, what's up?\nAnd you're like, oh shit. So, it's six hours of\njust like, oh, cool, nice. Yeah.\n- That's rough. - Yeah, yeah.\n- You're right. You're right. I like people that are\ncomfortable in silence. - Yeah. But then that also raises the question, are they about to kill me? You know what I mean? - I think that's a you problem, not a... (Andrew and Lex laughing) - You know what's funny\nis almost everybody who picked me up when I was hitchhiking was like a day laborer.\n- Yeah. - It was almost all Mexican\nday laborers who picked me up. - Oh, interesting. - Because I think that in\nsome places down there, that's a typical thing\nto do, hitchhike to work. A lot of people don't have cars, but they still have to get to their jobs. So, a lot of people ask me, \"Hey, where should I drop you off? Where's your job at?\" And I'm like, my job is to explore. And they were down with it. - See, for me, it was really easy, because you just say like, I'm traveling across the United States. - Mm. - And I think people love that idea. - Yeah.\n- And they want to help. - Mm-hmm. - I think they romantic... Because they also have\nthat invisible door. - Mm-hmm.\n- Everybody has that invisible door. I just want to go. - So you know what I'm talking about. - [Lex] Yeah, I don't think- - It can anchor you a bit, just to remind you that every pattern that I've fallen into is voluntary and it's for my own\nstability and mental health. - Well, that's why I'm renting everything and I'm making sure\n- Yeah. - tomorrow I can just go. I gave away everything\nI own twice in my life. Just very like,\n- Mm-hmm. - I'm ready to go tonight. Let's go. - What's the hardest item you've had to part with\nin this experience? - There's nothing. - You've never had a material object that was really hard to let go of? - No. - So, you'd give that watch to somebody if it meant an object?\n- No, this, you're right. (palm taps) You're right. That's probably the only... I've never had to let go of that though. - Yeah.\n- But that's the only thing I own. This means a lot to me.\nBut everything else. But then, again, listen, because okay, this watch\nis given to me by Rogan, who's become a close friend. But whenever I romanticize the notion that this watch means\na lot to me, he's like, \"Don't worry about it, I'll just get you the same one again.\" - [Andrew] Yeah. (Andrew and Lex laughing) It's like goddamnit. So-\n- It's a pretty sick-ass gift though. - Yeah. It's pretty sick. I'm not usually a gift guy, but when when somebody you look up to gives you a thing, it's\na nice little symbol - Yeah.\n- of that relationship. So, it's nice. But other than that, no. But even this, like whatever. The relationship is what matters. The human is what matters, not the- - [Andrew] I agree a hundred percent. - You had something like this? - Not really. There was a hard drive that I lost that had all of my\nchildhood pictures on it and stuff like that, that\nI think about all the time. 'Cause I left it on a train. And the certain memories, you think about it, you\njust get pissed off. I just think to myself,\nsomeone has that somewhere. I have dreams\n- Mm-hmm. - about reuniting with the hard drive. - You and Hunter Biden have the similar kind of dream.\n(Andrew laughing) - I don't think he wants\nto reunite with that one. - [Lex] Okay. - Dude, it's crazy. All he did was smoke crack, right? - Yeah.\n- Or was there more stuff going on? - I think there's prostitutes involved. - Oh, okay. Whatever. - I think you gotta look into it. - I think I have to look into it too.\n(Lex laughing) - I dunno. Yeah.\n(Andrew laughing) Was Kerouac, Jack Kerouac and somebody that was\nan inspiration at all in this road trip?\n- Nope. - Did you even know who that is? The Beat Generation and all this?\n- I didn't know who it was. And then, after I did the... Ultimately, I wrote a book about my hitchhiking\nexperience years later. And everyone was like, have\nyou read \"On the Road\"? And then, \"On the Road\", I probably heard the title of that book every day at\nleast 10 times for two years. And I'm sure Kerouac is a great guy. (Lex laughing) I just don't, I'm not too familiar\nwith the Beat Generation. - It's a great book. It's a... You read it or no? - I refuse to read it. People even have gifted it to me, have been like, \"Hey, man,\nyou're gonna love this one.\" And I'm like,\n- Yeah. - is that \"On the Road\"? Honestly, people have given me a book with wrapping paper on it\n(Lex laughing) and they're like, \"This\nis right up your alley.\" I was like, that's fucking\n\"On the Road\", isn't it? (Lex laughing) - Give you a different cover. - Yeah, no, I'm like, anything but that. But I'm sure it's a great book. It's just the comparison\nthing drives me crazy. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - But respect, big respect to Kerouac, would never speak down on that whole, anyone in the Beat Generation. - What are some interesting moments you remember from that, those 70 days? - Man, there was so much. Getting mistaken for a\ngay prostitute on my first hitchhiking ride\n- I can see that. - in Louisiana was pretty funny. - Where did you come from\nand where did you go? - Well, the journey began in Baton Rouge. And the first destination was Houston, which is about four and a half\nhours west on Interstate 10. So, I'm in Crowley, Louisiana. I'm on the side of the road and I guess this was\na cruising truck stop. It was known for being a place where male lot lizards\nwould go to procure clients. And I was there. - Lot lizards are- - It's a derogatory\nterm in trucker culture for a prostitute who hangs out at the Loves or Pilot Flying J. - Mm.\n- Large interstate truck stops. Now, trucker culture as it once was, is pretty much finished, because of the live stream cameras they have inside of the trucks now. So, you can't snort\nSudafed or pick up anybody. Can't even pick up a\nhitchhiker or you'll get fired. - Killed all the romance. - Yeah, definitely. The old school outlaw trucker lifestyle, unless you're an owner operator\nwho's not even in a union, which is like a real\ncowboy way to haul loads. You can't do that. - You were mistaken for a lot lizard. - Mistaken for a lot lizard\nby a small man from Honduras with a spiky leather\njacket covered in studs. - [Lex] Nice. - Didn't speak any English, but I thought he was just a nice guy. And then, he pulled over at a... There's private theaters in the south where they have\nconfessional booths set up and they have three channels and people go in there and you know. - Porn?\n- Yeah. - Mm-hmm.\n- People go in there and please themselves.\n- Masturbate. Yeah, uh-huh.\n- Yeah, yeah. So, he thought he was\ntaking me to one of those. And I was like, all\nright, cool, man. Yeah. If this guy wants to go jerk off, I'm just gonna wait in the car. It's all good. I don't discriminate. But then I was like,\nhe buys a booth for me. And I'm like, okay.\n- That's nice. - I'm not really in the mood to watch porn with this random guy. So, he gets in the same booth as me and he starts jerking\noff right next to me. And I'm like, oh, man. (Lex laughing) I don't think this is chill. I'm like, dude, can you stop? (Lex laughing) Can you stop jacking off? And he's like, \"What do you mean? I thought this is what you wanna do. I have money for you. Like, what's up?\"\n- Yeah. And I was like, oh, no,\nI'm just a regular guy. He was super cool about\nit. He started laughing. He was like, \"Oh, my bad, man. I thought you were selling something.\" I said no. And he said,\n\"Oh, it's all good.\"' And he gave me a ride\nall the way to Houston. - That's great.\n- Yeah. We talked about anything except that for the rest of the car ride. - That's great that he\njust rolled with it. Oh, sorry about that.\n- Yeah. It could have been... I had about a foot and a half on this guy,\n- Honest mistake. - so I wasn't too scared. I also had a knife in my pocket, but I didn't wanna stab him, especially not at a place like that. - And you were still, that didn't leave a bad\ntaste in your mouth? - Well, I figured that can't happen again. It can't keep happening, because I was like,\n(Lex laughing) all right, if I got this out of the way the first ride,\n- Yeah. - the following rides\nare gonna be spectacular. - Yeah, I mean, who among us have not been\nmistaken for a lot lizard? - It's a fact. You heard it here first. (Lex chuckles)"

      "text": "- What else? What's some interesting,\nbeautiful people that you've met along the way.\n- Well, I used the app Couchsurfing to find places to stay.\n- Nice. I remember Couchsurfing. - Now, you can only submit like five Couchsurfing requests a day, unless you're a premium\nmember, which means you also host people.\n- Wait, Couchsurfing's still around?\n- Yeah, yeah, totally. - [Lex] Oh nice. - But it's evolved obviously\ninto a different thing. - Airbnb is the competitor to that, right? - Couchsurfing is free though. - [Lex] Right. - So, Couchsurfing, they call\nit like the CS community. So, basically, there'd be\nthese Couchsurfing superhosts in different cities. There was one in Santa\nFe, this firefighter dude who had 15 other\ncouchsurfers there chilling. - [Lex] Nice. - So, I would do it everywhere. A lot of them were Catholics, - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - so it was their way of giving back. A lot of them were nudists. And so, I didn't realize that there's a small little section at the bottom of someone's\nCouchsurfing profile that says clothing optional. - Yes.\n- And that means if you go there, I thought it meant like it's cool if you walk to the\nbathroom in your underwear. No. If you go there,\neveryone's gonna be butt naked. - Mm-hmm.\n- So, I made that mistake a few times. Not that I'm anti-nudist,\nbut I didn't want to, I wasn't ready to take that leap of faith. And yeah, it was just great. Couchsurfing hosts were amazing. - [Lex] Yeah. - But that was just great. It was this constant thing where I felt like, wow,\npeople were so welcoming. I'm not having to pay them a\ndollar for this experience. - Yeah, I love Couchsurfing. - Yeah.\n- For like, again, for me being an introvert, just crashing on a person's couch, being essentially forced into\na great conversation is great. - Yeah. The one thing that gets exhausting about hitchhiking is\nconstantly thanking people. Being in constant superficial gratitude everywhere all the time. Like, oh, thanks for letting\nme sleep on your couch. Thanks for the food. - [Lex] Yeah. - Part of the reason I wanted to live in an RV later in life is to avoid having to constantly live in this thanks so much type of frequency, 'cause it's exhausting to\nconstantly, hey, man, thanks. - I think the shallowness\nof that interaction is exhausting.\n- Yeah. - Not just the, not the thanks.\n- Yeah. - It was a true favor, of course. I love giving people gratitude for that. But just this thing where\neveryone who picks you up is, you get eight rides a day, you're like thanking eight people a day. Like they're the second coming of Jesus. You start to feel a little bit debased. - What'd you learn about\npeople from that journey? That's your first time\nreally going into it. - That the American public\nis just so kind overall. They're so embracing\ndepending on who you are. And specifically though,\nthe Christian family people of the US who drive in minivans and have that fish sticker\non the back where it's like, Jesus fish,\n- Mm-hmm. - and then they have the family sticker, where each member of the\nfamily is a stick figure. Those people never picked me up and would flip me off\nwith their whole family. Sometimes they would throw\nfull Dr. Peppers at me as a family while I stood\non the side of the road- - As a family together. - They'd yell shit like,\n\"Go to hell, hippie,\" when I was on the side of the road. And so, it's weird that\nthe most charitable Christian American family values people never gave me any charity\nor even conversation. They were antagonizing me and saw me as like a hippie\nleftover from the '60s who needed to go to work go to Vietnam. I don't get it.\n- Yeah. Yeah.\n- But the people who really extended a hand to\nme is people on the margins. - Yeah.\n- People working on seasonal visas. People whose cars have less\nthan a quarter tank left. People struggling with\naddiction who saw me struggling, or at least they thought that I was, 'cause they assumed I was hitchhiking not out of adventure,\nbut 'cause I had no car. And were willing to sacrifice\ntheir day almost sometimes to take me exactly where I needed to go. - That's beautiful, man. I've had similar kind of experience that people who are struggling\nthe most are the ones who are willing to help\nyou when you're struggling. - Yeah. - There's people like in religious context and other kind of communities\nthat just judge others, - Right.\n- because they've constructed a value system where they're better than others, because of that value system.\n- Mm-hmm. - And that actually has a cascade that forces you to actually be a dick to other humans.\n- Yeah, I never thought about that way. That's so true. Do you think about morality\nand religion a lot? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been to certain parts of the world where religion is really\na big part of life. - [Andrew] Hmm. - I'm just always skeptical about tribes of people that believe a thing and they believe they're\nbetter than others, because they believe that thing. That could be nations,\nthat could be religions. - [Andrew] Yeah. - In Ukraine and in Russia, I've seen a lot of hate towards the other. - [Andrew] Yeah. - And that hate, I'm\nalways very skeptical of, 'cause it could be used by powerful people to direct that hate, just so the powerful people can maintain power and get\nmoney, this kind of stuff. - It's a scary thing to see how easy it is for high-up political\npeople to mobilize the hate of just the average working person and can almost convince them to sabotage their own countrymen, who they share more in common with than the politician they look up to just to advance the agenda of one party. That's what we're seeing now. - Are there some places in America that are better than others? Can you speak negatively of like aforementioned Joe Rogan talk shit about Connecticut nonstop? Can you pick a region in the United States\nyou can talk shit about? - To talk shit about? Oh, for sure. (Lex chuckles) - Or from that experience. Let's just narrow it down to that. - Oh, Colorado.\n(Lex laughing) Oh, Jesus.\n- Really? - Yes.\n- I know so many people that love Colorado.\n- Dude, Dallas, Denver. I used to think Phoenix\nsucks, but I love Phoenix now. The way they build these cities to just be so circular and massive. It's just like, stop. - You don't like circles? - I like grids, man. - Oh, you're a grid guy. - Manhattan, New Orleans, San Francisco. - What is it about grids that\nbring out the worst in people? (Andrew laughing) Circles is where everyone\njust, there's a... - Everyone's just vibing out, loosey-goosey,\n- Yeah. - but the grid gets people locked in and hateful.\n- Yeah. - I don't know, man, but-\n(Lex laughing) - I've never heard anyone talk shit about Colorado, I have to say. It's kinda refreshing. - Yeah.\n- Because it provides a necessary balance for the\nColorado Wikipedia page. - Yeah. Oh, Oregon too. I got problems with Oregon. - Oregon.\n- Yeah. - Well, here's the issue. You have...\n- Mm-hmm. - And I don't like just\ncalling people racist, 'cause it's like a two-dimensional insult, but you have the most racist state with the most psychotic anarchist\ncity in the middle of it. What is going on up there?\nHow did this happen? The yin and the yang is so extreme that there must be\nsomething in the Willamina. - What do you have against anarchism? - I have nothing. I\nused to be an anarchist. When I was in eighth grade,\nI had this friend named Mads, who was part of a group\ncalled Seattle Solidarity, which is like an Antifa precursor. So, I grew up going to\nBlack Bloc protests. And there was a particular shooting, the murder of John Williams, who's a native American wood\ncarver in downtown Seattle. He got killed by a Seattle\npolice officer named Ian Birk. John Williams was carving a pipe from a woodblock with a pocket knife. He's deaf in one ear. Officer pulls a gun on him\nand says, \"Put it down.\" He doesn't hear him. He\nshoots him six seconds later. So, that police-involved shooting is what instantly turned\nme into a very critical of law enforcement kind of\nperson when I was super young. And so, as someone who\nused to see this guy who got murdered, he\nwas a 55-year-old man. I used to see him around Pike\nPlace where my mom lived. It's a public market in downtown. That to me, put me into the\nanarchist political sphere. Just channeling the\nanger of that experience. And the officer got no\ncharges, by the way. You can look up the video. It's horrific. And it didn't get reported. The officer, I'm pretty\nsure, is still active duty. And so, it's like situations\nlike that early in life channeled me toward political extremism. But I grew up to realize how incompatible that anarchistic worldview is with reality and with American society. It can only exist in a\nsmall little chamber. You can't apply that to the industrial\nheartland of the country. - And I think also anarchism. So, we've gotten to know Michael Malice, who's written quite a bit about anarchism. And it's also exists\nas a body of literature about different philosophical notions that resist the state,\n- Mm-hmm. - the ever-expanding state\nin different kinds of ways. And it's always nice to have\nextreme thought experiments to understand\n- Mm-hmm. - what kind of society we want to build. But implementing it may not\nnecessarily be a good idea. - Yeah, Emma Goldman, I'm\na huge fan of her writing. Also the prison abolitionists that are associated with\nthe anarchist movement, Angela Davis, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, all that stuff influential, I still adhere to a lot of those principles\nwhen talking about stuff like radical prison reform\nand stuff like that. But just, I drifted more toward having a more open mind as I got older. - Extremism implemented in almost all of its forms is probably going to\ncause a lot of suffering. - Yeah. - You worked as a doorman on the,"

      "text": "I could say legendary Bourbon\nStreet in New Orleans. - [Andrew] That's right. (Lex chuckles) - Where you saw what you described as, this might be another\nWikipedia quote by the way, - But this-\n- This is where I do my research is Wikipedia.\n- Does it say hellish scenes? - [Lex] Hellish scenes in quotes. - Wikipedia is damn right about that one. - All right, thank you. (Andrew laughing) (Lex laughing) That's a win. That's\none in the win column. So, yeah, tell the story of that. What's it like to work on Bourbon Street? What kind of stuff did you see? - I was a host at a fine dining restaurant on the corner of Bourbon in Iberville. So, that's the first street if you go from Canal\nStreet onto the corridor, so this is like across\nfrom a daiquiri spot. It's the middle of the tourist\ncorridor of New Orleans. And the spot was like, and\nkind of a tourist trap. It was called Bourbon\nHouse. The food was good. Chef Eric, I don't want you to see this and think you don't make\ngood andouille sausages, but it was overpriced. And so, we had to maintain\nthis fine dining facade on a street where almost everyone is throwing up, fighting,\nor is half naked. So, there was this policy. We had these giant glass\nwindows next to the tables. So, if you're eating at Bourbon House, you can look out onto Bourbon Street and you can see as you're dining, a full panoramic view of all\nthese partiers, throwing beads, - Yeah.\n- boobs, all that. - [Andrew] Yeah. - We had this policy where\nif we're serving someone, we can't look onto Bourbon Street if something crazy is happening. So, there's a fight\n(Lex laughing) or something like that, we can't look. So, there is a dude, I remember I'm fucking serving a table. There's a dude in a Batman mask, butt naked with 12 pairs\nof beads just jerking it. - Yeah.\n- Back to jerking it. - Full on.\n- He's jerking it. And every single person\n(Lex chuckles) at the restaurant's\nlooking out there like, look, they're taking pictures. And the manager, Steven,\nlooks at me, he's like, \"Keep your fucking eyes\non the table.\" (laughs) So, I'm serving these people and I'm like, would you like\n(Lex laughing) red beans and rice? Or would you like some\nCreole fucking da, da, da. And there's just this dude. And ultimately, the manager went out and escorted him further\ndown Bourbon Street. But I would get off work at\naround midnight every night. And that was when Bourbon\nStreet is at its most chaotic. And so, I lived in the\nFrench Quarter as well, - Oh, wow.\n- so I lived about 12 blocks down Bourbon in a small Creole cottage in a cute little orange old school\nnew Orleans one story spot. I lived in the attic, above these gay meth dealers\nnamed Frankie and Johnny. - [Lex] Oh wow. - And so, (chuckles) I would get off work and I would basically have to walk through\nlike this battlefield. It was a battlefield. Getting home was out of\nlike \"The Warriors\" movie. It was-\n- The best of humanity on display.\n- Yeah. It was like Kensington,\nPhiladelphia, but just alcohol. You know what I mean? - Oh, it's all alcohol.\nBut it's a lot of... Wait, a lot of visitors,\nright, from outside? - Almost all visitors.\n- Yeah. - And that would set the\nflow for the weekend. For example, if the Raiders\nwere playing the Saints, Raider Nation, and they\ndo not play around. If it's the Patriots, that's\na whole different crowd. They think they're better than everybody else.\n- Yeah. Well, they technically are\nbetter than everybody else, but yeah.\n- But people from Massachusetts aren't\nlike the cream of the crop in terms of American superiority. - Strong words. Yeah. - No offense, but I mean. - No, I'm sure they won't take that as offense. (laughs) - They are good at fighting\nthough, I'll tell you that. - [Lex] All right. Great. - New England has hands\n- Right. - compared to some places. - Which places are those? Colorado. - Colorado has no hands. - [Lex] Yeah. (Andrew and Lex laughing) - The West Coast, not too much hands. - That's why you feel safe\ntalking shit about Colorado. - But if you get to the\ncorn-fed parts of East Colorado, - Yeah.\n- these guys got hands bigger than my head. They'll beat the shit\n- Yeah. - out of me, but anyways. I'd walk back to my\nhouse on Bourbon Street, and I would be sifting\nthrough this battlefield. And I had a friend at\nthe time who was like, \"Yo, we should do a taxi\ncab confessions type spinoff where we ask people to\nconfess a deep, dark secret.\" And we posted the next day. And so, we tried that and it went viral on Instagram instantly. It was mostly incest stories,\npeople admitting to incest. I know it's a common southern stereotype, but there's some truth to it. There was some murder confessions. That was pretty crazy. We never really posted any of those, but. - How'd you get people to confess? - Pretty easy. And New Orleans has a homicide\nsolve rate of like 22%. So, most of the time,\nthey'll just tell you. I remember I was walking down Bourbon and I asked this kid, I was like, what's your deepest, darkest secret? And he told me, he's like, \"I just smoked a dude in the Magnolia.\" It's a project house in the Third Ward, project development. And they said, \"I just smoked a dude in\nthe Magnolia playground for touching my sister,\"\nmolesting his sister. And I was like, what? And he was like, \"Yeah, look it up.\" And I was like, all right, hold on. And it was like, man found dead\nin Central City playground. Appeared to be homeless,\nshot execution style. So, I told the kid, I was\nlike, why'd you tell me that? He's like, \"Man, put that shit out there. I'm trying to go viral. Tag me too.\" - Oh wow.\n- Like, dude, I don't think you understand\nthat even if you're a juvenile, he was probably 15,\n- Yeah. - you can get juvenile life in Louisiana for a homicide, even if it's justified. So, I just deleted the\nfootage in front of him. I was like, I'm gonna delete this footage. See that trash button? I'm hitting it right now.\n(Lex chuckles) Don't tell anyone that again. And he was like,\n(Lex laughing) \"All right, I appreciate it.\" And he walked off. But it's the little moments like that that I always remember.\n(Lex sighs) - Anything for the gram, I guess. - Yeah. After a while though, it\nbecame sort of a repetitive, 'cause there's only so many things that people can confess to\nthat go viral, and just... - Oh, so you were trying to see like what- - Well, there's the incest one. Some people just say like, \"I eat ass.\" That was like everyone said that. Or like, \"I cheated on someone,\" or. - I've seen a surprising number of people on your channel\nsay mention eating ass. - Yeah. (Andrew laughing) How seriously you said that. - Yeah.\n- will live in my head for the rest of my life.\n(Lex laughing) - That's good.\n- Yeah. I have- - I want to live in your head - Mm.\n- saying that a lot of people mention eating ass. - Yeah. A lot of people do mention that. - Yeah.\n- Also, that's where I developed this magnetism\nfor freestyle rapping. Everywhere I go, people rap. Not sure why. As a former rapper myself in middle school and for the first year of high school, I think that maybe it\ntakes one to know one. But everywhere I go, people start rapping. If you and me went outside\nof this podcast studio and walked around for five minutes, I could find somebody.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] That's rapping. - I can tell who raps or who can rap, who has eight bars in their\nhead that they're ready to go. - I think you're also,\nthere's something about you that gives them, creates the safe space - Yeah.\n- to perform their art. - Yeah. The \"Quarter Confession\" series was the first time you saw the suit. - [Lex] That's when the suit came out. - [Andrew] Yeah, it was\nkinda like a Ron Burgundy, Eric Andre inspired type- - [Lex] Where'd you get that suit? - [Andrew] Goodwill. - Goodwill.\n- Yeah. Always. (Lex breathes out) - Wow. I was playing checkers, you\nwere playing chess. Good job. - Goodwill has a surprising amount of identical gray suits for sale. - Yeah, I've actually gotten suits at thrift stores before. They're great.\n- Yeah. A lot of people donate suits and I was going for oversized suits, which are the cheapest ones there, so. - [Lex] Yeah. - It was like 12 bucks, 12 to $25 every time for the outfit. - If I wanted to look super sophisticated, like I'm from another era, - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - I would go to thrift store. - [Andrew] Yeah. - 'Cause they're usually like this, there's like a, like\nthe patterns they have, it's just like a more sophisticated suit, which is what you picked out. It made you look ridiculous, but in the best kind of way. - The tough part about\n\"Quarter Confessions\" for me is that everybody that was\nfeatured, for the most part, would more or less regret\nbeing a part of the show. - [Lex] Yeah. - And that over time, just gave me a bad feeling\nwhere I was like, you know what? I feel like I am doing\nan ambush interview, especially 'cause I'm\npresenting as so agreeable. Yet the intention is to\nmake something funny. - Yeah.\n- And I get that that's what people do\nin the satire sphere. I'm sure Ali G and Bruno and\nBorat did the same thing. And I don't think it's unethical, 'cause that's all for\nthe purposes of comedy. It is what it is. But for me, I wanted to\ndo something different. - Yeah. Because there's an\nintimacy to confessing a thing. - [Andrew] Right. - And then, you just don't really realize the implications of that. - And the atmosphere of Bourbon Street is like anything goes.\n- Yeah. - It's a free-spirited place, but if you transport that energy digitally to a different place like Colorado, - [Lex] Yeah. - They might look at it and be like... - Different place in time,\nlike five years later. - [Andrew] Right. - That same person has a\nfamily and stuff like this, and all of a sudden, they're\ntalking about eating ass. - Right. Exactly.\n- And you're like- - The kids have to think about that. Or imagine if there's\na video of your grandma or grandpa out there when he was a kid\ntalking about eating ass. That's a horrible experience to discover that\n(Lex laughing) about your respected elder\nlater in life, it's tough. - I don't even know where to go with that. But literally the opening question was, tell me your deepest, darkest secret? - Yeah. - You just come up to somebody like that? - [Andrew] Yeah. - How often do you get a no? What's the yes to no ratio? - Well, the weird thing is like, we don't really extract\nanswers from people. What makes a good interview is when they're ready to talk. - Yeah.\n- The more you have to talk and try to get an answer out of them, - [Lex] Yeah. - it's just not a good vibe. So, we look for people who appear to be already ready to talk. Open body language, they\nseem confident and verbose and we approach them first. - [Lex] There's a look. - We wouldn't approach a shy person and be like, come on, tell me. No. - What about a person\nwith pain in their eyes? - Oh, yeah, we're interviewing them. - Yeah. So, they're ready to talk. There's just not like-\n- Yeah. - There's different ways to be ready. - [Andrew] Right. - I see homeless people a lot and they always look fascinating. And the ones I've talked\nto are always fascinating. - [Andrew] Yeah. We just did a video in the Vegas tunnels, trying to, obviously it got\ntaken down by FOX, but whatever. We-\n- I was gonna make a joke that I didn't see it. (Andrew laughing) - We tried to help a lot of\nthem by getting them IDs. And when I made the documentary, I had this idea that if I... It's a big roadblock for them\nis getting identification. Without IDs, you can't check\ninto a homeless shelter, you can't do day labor, you\ncan't qualify for housing. Nothing. So, when we interviewed them,\nthey'd basically tell us, \"If I had my ID, I wouldn't be here.\" And so, we said, okay, we're\ngonna really help this time. We're not just gonna talk to\n'em about their struggles. We're gonna actively go out\nand get them IDs at the DMV. So, we did that and nothing\nreally changed in their life. And we sat down with a recovery specialist who works directly with\nthem day in and day out. He explained to me that he's been trying to do the same thing I tried to do in a one week period\nfor the past 10 years. And that they have\ndeeper underlying traumas and pain that need to be dealt with far before they even take the steps to enter society as a housed person. (Lex deeply sighs) - That's a heavy truth right there. - Breaking that shame\ncycle has to come first, because you gotta think, I'm from a generation that\nromanticizes a vagrancy and homelessness to a certain extent, if it's called van life or if it is done in a way\nthat's like Rolling Stone, Willie Nelson hit the road. People who are above 50,\nthey feel really embarrassed to be in the spiral of homelessness. They feel like failures. A lot of them have kids\nwho they weren't there for. That's not the kind of\npain that can be dealt with by giving someone a tiny home. - Yeah.\n- It's a good step forward. But for someone to really make a change, they have to want to change. And so, it's how do you help someone and guide themselves\nin the right direction? And if you're too paternalistic and you use shame as a method\nto get them to clean up, they're gonna end up\nright where they started. - [Lex] Yeah. - That's a tough truth to accept, 'cause a lot of people\nwant a quick fix to things. And I don't blame people who go out and give baloney sandwiches\nout to the homeless. - And each case is probably\nits own little puzzle. - Each person is so complex. Now, imagine drug abuse,\n- Yeah. - what that does to the brain. - [Lex] Yeah. - Trauma, childhood trauma.\nThere's so much to unpack. And then, jus the belief that\nthey're the undesirables. That they don't deserve\nto be a part of society, because they failed a\nfundamental obligation like taking care of their kids. - If we could take a small tangent to, you mentioned this Vegas\nvideo, which is fascinating. It was taken down recently by YouTube or YouTube took it down based on - [Andrew] Yeah. It was illegal. - FOX 5, I guess. - So, the documentary was\nan hour and 45 minutes. We used 10 seconds of a news clip that was publicly\nbroadcast by FOX 5 Vegas. And according to the\nCopyright Act of 1976, you're allowed to use any\npublicly broadcast news clip in a transformative capacity\nin any documentary film or research paper or\nbroadcast or anything. They, specifically this\ncorporation called Gray Media that controls the TV stations\nin almost every small town, they had lawyers hit up YouTube and YouTube complied with\nan illegal copyright strike to get our video immediately removed. And I'm a YouTube partner. I'm in the YouTube Partner Program. So, to think that I wasn't forewarned is, it's a bit strange, but it also smells like corruption to me to a certain extent. - Yeah. You shouldn't\nhave that amount of power. At the very least, they\nshould have the power to just silence that\nfive-second clip maybe. - Yeah. But I'm taking them to court because I have the means\nto be able to do so. I'm a larger creator. I have an audience, I have that\nfinancial backing to do it. I can't imagine how many people out there are smaller creators with\nnot as much consumer, a fan base they can mobilize\nagainst someone like FOX 5 or the money to go to court. So, I want to take them all\nthe way there to set precedent for future cases, so that these giant\nmainstream media conglomerates can't copyright strike\ndocumentary filmmakers at will. It doesn't make sense. - Oh, thank you for doing that. That's really, really, really important. And that's really powerful. And it might hopefully empower YouTube to also put pressure on people to not... And YouTube is in a difficult position, because there's so much content out there, there's so many claims,\nit's hard to investigate. But YouTube should be in a place where they push back\nagainst this kind of stuff. - [Andrew] Yeah. - as a first line of defense, especially to protect smaller creators. So, what you're doing is\nreally, really important. - [Andrew] Appreciate it, man. - And it sucks that it was taken down. - [Andrew] Yeah. - Do you have any hope? - Well, I talked to my\nYouTube partner today and he said that the FOX 5 lawyers have two weeks to comply\nwith my counter appeal. But (chuckles) I spent 20 grand on human voiceovers in\nfive different languages. So, I invested probably in\ntotal, like 70k into this video. So, even if it gets reinstated, the steam's kind of been\ntaken out of its trajectory. - But also it's just like\na really important video. It's good for the world. And why-\n- Yeah. Why the hell would FOX 5 have a vested interest in\nhaving the video taken down? - I Just hate it when\npeople do that to videos or to creators that are\ndoing good in the world. - Yeah. It's not an expose\non the mayor of Las Vegas. It's an attempt to show\nthe civilian public how to get involved in a local nonprofit and potentially intervene in\nthe lives of the tunnel people. - Well, fuck FOX 5. The\nother Channel 5, as you said. - Yeah. (chuckles) - Well, thank you for pushing back - Hey, man.\n- and highlighting it. Hopefully it gets brought back up. But yeah, defending other creators, - Yeah.\n- so that other creators can take risks and don't get taken\ndown for stupid reasons. - Yeah. - So, \"Quarter Confessions\" was written? - No, it was all real life\nreality TV documentary, but it caught the attention of a larger company\ncalled Doing Things Media. - Yes.\n- And they contacted me pretty much like a week after I graduated from\ncollege in the May of 2019. And they said, \"Hey, how would you\nlike to produce a show?\" I was like, what do you mean? They were like, \"We'll get you an RV. We'll pay you 45k a year. We'll pay for gas, for\nfood, for two hotels a week. Go out there, make content, and we'll be in the background\njust powering it all.\" - And that was the birth\nof \"All Gas No Brakes\". - Yes. \"All Gas No Brakes\" was named\nafter a book that I wrote called \"All Gas, No Brakes:\nA Hitchhiker's Diary\", which chronicled the 70-day journey that we were just talking about. - [Lex] It's a tough\nbook to find, by the way. - Oh, yeah, there's\nonly a few copies left. I'm thinking about doing a reprint at some point down the line, but I sold off the last 100 copies like a month and a half ago. - Mm-hmm.\n- Yeah. - Until then, you guys should go read \"On the\nRoad\" by Jack Kerouac. - [Andrew] Yeah, read off- - You should read it.\n(Andrew laughing) I don't know if you read it before.\n- If you can't get my book, get \"On the Road\" by Jack Kerouac. - [Lex] It's great. - It's the best. - When's your birthday? I'll send you... (Andrew laughing) - April 23rd.\n- Okay. - I'm a Taurus. Coming soon. - Typical Taurus. Yeah. - Yeah. I'm a typical Taurus man. I'm a Scorpio moon. You\njust write that down. - What's the time when you were born? - [Andrew] 11:30. - 11:30 at night or... Oh, of course.\n- Yeah. Typical. This guy knew it. That's the real science.\n- Yeah. - Anyways, so all the idea of\n\"All Gas No Brakes\" as a show was to combine the, I guess, road dog ethos of the\n\"All Gas No Brakes\" book with the presentation and editing style of\n\"Quarter Confessions\". So, is to take \"Quarter\nConfessions\" on the road that was pretty much like a simulated hitchhiking experience, but with the editing and punchy effects of\n\"Quarter Confessions\", which is like, I wear a suit,\nwe do the fast zoom ins, little effects, stuff like that. It was a, man, those were the best years. It was just so fun. Imagine you're fresh out of college, you were just a doorman\ninterviewing people about making out with\ntheir cousin and stuff. And then, boom, this company\nthat you've never even heard of is willing to buy you an\nRV and give you 45k a year, which to me at the time, was more money than I\ncould possibly imagine. So, I called my dad, I was like, dad, I need you to find me an RV, 'cause he's the only guy I\nknow who knows about cars. And even he doesn't know much about cars. So, he's like, \"All right, I'm on it.\" So, the RV was 20,000.\n- Mm-hmm."

      "section": "Burning Man",
      "text": "- And the first event that\nwe were called to cover was the Burning Man Festival. And that was tough, because Burning Man is\nnot too keen on filming. It's supposed to be a non-commercialized escape from reality. They have a gift economy set up. It's based upon mutual\nparticipation and non-exploitation. And so, the idea of\nmaking a Burning Man video was tough at first,\nbecause burners oftentimes, and this is not all of them, but are pretty well-off in general. A lot of them have tech jobs or pretty high up in Silicon Valley. And Burning Man is where\nthey go to take off, to take the edge off, and basically become their burner persona. On the playa, they become reborn. And they take ketamine and they wear kaleidoscope glasses and steampunk hats\n- Yeah. - and they snort MDMA and\nthey run around the sand, listen to tech.\n- Do you snort MDMA? That's one.... I need to Google MDMA.\n- Yes, you can. - I thought it's a pill.\n- Yeah. - I didn't know. - It's better to take\nit in a pill or water, but you can snort MDMA. - I definitely need to take MDMA. I'm already full of love, but like that, I'd probably\ngo on another level. - Yeah, don't snort it, 'cause it'll only last like 90 minutes. - Hmm. Let me write that down.\n- Yeah. So, anyways, we didn't know what to do, because we didn't try to film. - Don't snort. - The initial idea for\n\"All Gas No Brakes\" was to, instead of asking people what's your deepest, darkest secret, it was, what's the craziest\ntrip you've been on? - [Lex] Hmm. - So, the idea was to not\nsatirize drunk people, but satirize people who are fried on acid. - Oh.\n- And so, we went to Boulder real quick. Did a test interview with some lady who talked about seeing ancestral aliens during a peyote retreat. And so, it's pretty easy to extract trip reports from hippies and gutter punks and stuff\nlike that, or oogles. So, we go to Burning Man. We start asking people like, what's your craziest trip story? And they didn't have the same type of free-flowing storytelling style that like a on the street cross punk in New Orleans might have, where they're like, \"I don't give a fuck. I'll tell you whatever.\" These people were very bottled up about what they were willing to disclose. So, we went on Burning Man\nRadio and we did a broadcast. And we said, hey, we're\npsychedelic journalists. It was me and my friend, CL, at the time. I said, we're psychedelic journalists. We're parked on 10 and I, which is a cross street\nin Black Rock City. And we said, we have a 1998\nCatalina Coachmen Sport. It's an RV. We've set up a podcast studio. We're doing a show about\npsychedelic voyages. - [Lex] Yeah. - So, lo and behold, two hours later, we had 10 people lined up at the RV - Nice.\n- willing to talk. - Nice.\n- So, that vetted people in advance for us. And so, we did a couple\ninterviews and that was that. - What were some of the\nstories from the trip reports? - There was this lady named Razma who said that she was known in several circles in Berkeley\nfor being multi-orgasmic and could create multiple\nrepeated climaxes using only her mind by squinting her eyes and squeezing her eyes together so much that the pleasure spiral just went crazy. - I feel like I talked to several people like that at Berkeley. - Yeah. You know what I'm talking about. - Not that.... Well, yeah, that lady, I think she manifest\nherself in many forms? Yeah.\n- Right. But still, it was on the cruder end. There was one guy named Kimbo\nSlice was his burner name. He talked about taking a shit after taking a quarter of mushrooms and how he was seeing his childhood and visualizing his past life as the turds were flowing into the toilet and just talks about the psychedelic union between pooing and taking shrooms. - And so, he was very\nvisual with his words. - Yeah. So, there was stuff like that. I interviewed Alex Grey,\nwhich was super cool, about his first trip in San\nFrancisco when he was in 1971, shortly after the Summer of Love. I got to do some pretty cool interviews, but still, it was semi-ambush style. I wouldn't say that we\nwere doing journalism yet. It was still comedic video work. - Was there a narrative - No.\n- that tied it together? It's like really just a trip,\ncomedic almost with the- - Interview, and then I go, Burning Man. And then, it's onto the next one. So, I guess that could\ngive a loose structure, but it's just like a\npunchy and slapstick thing. Everything was going good until we interviewed this\nguy named DJ Soft Baby. He was wearing a golden leotard with once again, kaleidoscope glasses, shirtless dancing like dancing. And he was eating chowder\nout of a plastic bowl. And he was like, \"This\nchowder is so fucking good. He is like, \"This is the best chowder\nI've ever had in my life.\" And he starts putting\nthe chowder on his face and he is like, \"I want the\nchowder all over me, yeah.\" And so, we just go, hey, man, can you just do a dance for us real quick, just for some B-roll? He does a dance. We post it on Instagram the next morning. Doing Things Media CEO calls me, Reid, he says all of our pages are down. And he's like, \"That guy you\nfilmed dancing last night on drugs putting chowder on his face, that guy's at the top of MIT.\" - Top of MIT. I don't understand what that means-\n- He went to MI-\n- That's exciting. (Andrew laughing) - Yo, my brother's a rocket science. He is like head of NASA or whatever.\n(Andrew and Lex laughing) - Well, the guy knows people in Boston. - [Lex] Okay. - Not in the Whitey Bulger\nsense, but in the reverse sense. - I have trouble believing\nthat DJ Soft Baby. - Oh, DJ Soft Baby was major.\n(Lex chuckles) It could have been Harvard\n- Major. - It could have been, but it wasn't UMass. - I don't think there's\nanybody that's at quote, at the head of MIT who's putting, what was it, all over his face? - Chowder.\n- Chowder. - Well then, you haven't\nbeen to Burning Man yet. - Okay. (laughs) - I have not been to Burning Man. - So-\n- I may have to consult my colleagues at MIT if they know DJ Soft Baby.\n- Yeah. So, whoever-\n- He probably was Harvard. Let's put it on them.\n- Okay. The Top of Harvard.\n(Lex laughing) So, he made some calls to the tops,\n- Yeah. - to the heads of big tech\n- Yeah. - and got all the Doing\nThings Media pages taken down. At the time, that was like\na vast network of pages. And we ended up having to take the, obviously, the video came down and he held the entire network\nof Instagram pages hostage. And so, that was... He made us agree to never\npost that video again, and then somehow got all\nof our pages reinstated. So, that was my first brush\nwith powerful people on drugs. And that was probably my last brush with\npowerful people on drugs. - So, what did you\ntransition into from there? - I think after Burning\nMan, we went to the south, went to Talladega race weekend, went to a Donald Trump Jr. book signing, went to a Juggalo adjacent fetish mansion in Central Florida called\nThe Sausage Castle. - A Juggalo adjacent sauce... Okay, can you run that by me again? - A Juggalo adjacent fetish\nmansion in Central Florida. - Okay. Fetish Mansion in central Florida. Juggalo adjacent fe... Every single one of those words I feel like\n- Yeah. - needs a book or something. - [Andrew] Right. - So, Jug... By the way, who are the Juggalos? Is this ICP?\n- Just ICP fans. - ICP fans. Okay, okay. - But I say adjacent, because\nit's not a Juggalo mansion, but there's a lot of Juggalos who kick it at the mansion\nand it's Juggalo-friendly. - Oh, okay. Juggalo-friendly. - Yeah, 'cause they get made\nfun of in a lot of places. - Oh, so, it's not... Okay, got it. - And Juggalos say outrageous shit and they embarrass themselves\nand they fight a lot. So, they're kind... They're on the FBI's gang list, which if you ask me and- - [Lex] ICP Or the- - The Juggalos. - [Lex] The Juggalos. - If-\n- Who is the head of the Juggalos? - It would be Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope. But there's associated acts like Twiztid and there's a whole rabbit hole. Honestly, Tech N9ne is a part of that. - Tech N9ne, I don't know who that is. Should I know who that is? - He's actually one of the\ntop selling touring rappers, despite having not that many streams. Tech N9ne is like, it's got a huge cult\nfollowing in Missouri. This is like, the Juggalos\nstarted in war in Michigan. - We should also say\nICP Insane Clown Posse. So, this is a thing, this is a movement. - Oh, yeah. If you went to Seattle\nright now and punched a cop and they booked you in county jail, - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - you may end up running\nwith the Juggalos. - Running with the Juggalos. - They're a presence in Pacific Northwest Prison\nsystem from what I've heard. - Can you tell a Juggalo from a distance? Well, they say whoop whoop. - Whoop whoop?\n- So, if you see a Juggalo, they'll say that. Also like- (Lex chuckles) I'll try to look out for that. - It's called the Dark Carnival is the mythology they abide by. - What do they define themselves? What's the ideology of-\n- A family, a family. - No, I understand, but\nwhat's the ideology? What's the philosophical\nfoundation of the- - They're anti-racist. They like to drink Faygo and also just cheap liquor\nand stuff like that. They're into drugs.\n- Yeah? - A lot of circles, if\nyou pull out a crack pipe, people will be like, I don't\nwanna drink with you anymore. If you're at a Juggalo party and someone's smoking twiz or something, it's relatively accepted. - What's twiz?\n- Meth. - Meth. Right, right. Lots of tattoos? - Yeah. The Hatchet Man\nis the most common one. So, it's a Psychopathic Records logo. It's a cartoon of a\nclown wheeling a hatchet. It's actually a pretty sick logo. - I vaguely remember enjoying\nsome of the ICP music. - [Andrew] It's good. - Yeah, it's pretty good.\nIt's funny, it's edgy. - Well, they get satirized a lot, but I got love for the clowns. And also, so when \"All Gas No Brakes\" transitioned away from\nrich elite drug parties and into the south, that's when the fun\nreally started to happen. Living in your RV in Alabama and Florida and stuff is the best. - Why? What is it about Alabama?\n- People are just so friendly down there and it's warm year-round\n- Yeah, yeah. - and people are non-judgmental\nand it's just great. The south gets hated on a lot, especially in the coastal states. Mississippi and Alabama are like the butts of a\nlot of jokes and stuff. But those are great states. - No, I love it. New Mexico,\nAlbuquerque, all those. - Oh, yeah. The ABQ is great. - ABQ, what's that? - Albuquerque. That's what Jesse Pinkman\ncalled it is the ABQ. - Oh shit. The depth of references you\nbring to the table is intense. - [Andrew] It's okay. - I met a lady in Albuquerque when I was traveling\nacross the United States and she said, \"Take me with you.\" I said, I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't. - [Andrew] Yeah. - But I think about that lady. - I think you made the right call. - I don't know. Yeah, \"On the Road\"\n- Yeah. - by Jack Kerouac. - Best book I've ever read\n(Lex chuckles) in my life.\n(Lex laughing) - There's a moment when he\nmeets a nice girl on a bus and they have a love affair. - Mm.\n- It was good. - On the bus or they- - No, no. They went to California. Well, yeah. And there was a love affair on the bus, but it wasn't sexual. It was just romantic. It was- - It was in the air. - It was in the air,\nwhich there is something in the air on the bus, like a Greyhound mega bus,\n(Andrew chuckles) that type of situation. There's something-\n- Certainly something in the air.\n(Lex chuckles) - It was a romance. There is, man.\n- Yeah. - When you travel acro... 'Cause it's like\nstrangers getting together and you're like feeling each\nother out, but you're in it. Like you each have a story. 'Cause you wouldn't be taking\na bus unless you had a story. So, especially if you're\ntraveling across country. There's something-\n- You ever taken the dollar bus from Philly to New York? The Chinatown bus?\n- Yeah, I have. Yeah. - That's a great bus. The people on that. - It's not a fucking dollar though. There's some that are five bucks. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. If you book it way ahead of time, which it's like $20.\n(Andrew laughing) I was like, this is a\nfucking lie calling it $1. - I got on the-\n- I don't know why I'm swearing. The anger came out, I apologize.\n- Hey, swearing's okay sometimes. Last time I was on the Chinatown bus, there was like a rooster\nwalking down the aisle. - Actual rooster?\n- Yeah. Watch him chilling. It was awesome. - Well, there's a nice part\nof your film with a rooster. - Mm. I forgot about that.\n- Yeah. That felt almost fake. - Yeah. - [Lex] Did you plant the rooster? - No, the rooster, there's a\nplace in Ybor City in Tampa where roosters walk around all the time. And we had a rooster parked there right by the main drag for... What did I say we had a rooster parked? We had the RV parked at\nYbor City for a long time and the rooster laid eggs\nin the undercarriage. - [Lex] Nice. - Back to the \"All Gas\nNo Brakes\" thing though. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So, it was lots, it\nwas really fun making it. And then, we started \"All Gas No Brakes\" in September of 2019. Six months later, the country shuts down and everything just hits the fan. I was actually here in\nAustin when it shut down. I was on 6th Street. I remember the... I don't just hang out on\n6th Street all the time, but I was just-\n- Yeah, you do. Come on.\n(Andrew laughing) Let's just be honest. - I do like 6th Street.\n- Yeah. - I like East Austin better,\nbut I like 6th Street too. So, anyways, the NBA shuts down.\nEverything's shutting down. So, I went down to the Dirty\n6th and I asked this doorman, I was like, are you guys\never gonna shut down? He was like, \"Fuck no, bro.\nThe Dirty 6th never closes.\" And I was like, all right,\nwe'll see about that. Next day, plywood. And then, I was like, all right, I thought my career was\nover when COVID hit. I was like, what are we gonna do? Nothing's happening anymore. There's no more parties or Talladega races or\nBurning Mans to go to. So, I went back to Seattle in the RV and I just spent four months just depressed living in the RV, trying to figure out what would happen. - But \"All Gas No Brakes\" went on still through that.\n- Well, this was the craziest thing about that period of time is that when COVID hit, I'm sure you remember\neverything turned political - Yeah.\n- overnight. In Seattle, if you went to a house party, you can get canceled, because people were like,\noh, you're a super spreader. So, if you wanted to socialize even with a group of four or more, you had to do so with your\nphones damn near turned off. And a lot of people were doing hyper social\npolicing at that time. Beyond that, in the south and\nin more conservative places, they were doing the opposite. They were trying to prove that\nthey could hang out 500 deep with no mask to make a statement\nagainst the establishment. - Yeah.\n- So, you had this polarization that\nled to more division and that's when the\nanti-vax protests started. And I went to Sacramento\nand the passion was unreal. This is about two months after\nthe COVID lockdowns began. And that was my first political\nvideo was at the Sacramento, the California State Capitol\nin Sacramento documenting the, they called it the freedom rally, but that's typically like anti-vax stuff. And it was real intensity. And that video was my most\nsuccessful to date at that time. And so, I was like, okay, am\nI a political reporter now? Am I covering politics? What's going on? - What were the interviews\nthey made up that video? What style of questions\nwere you asking would? - I don't know if you'd remember, but I was actually scared\nwhen the pandemic started. I thought that this is something that might kill us all based\nupon what I was consuming. And so, I'd ask people, what do you think about this lockdown? And I've had people say,\nI'm immunocompromised. If I get exposed to COVID,\nI have a 95% fatality rate. But guess what? I'd rather be free and dead\nthan alive, living in fear. And I was like, wow. So, it was just stuff along those lines. You had some San Diego surfers there complaining about the\nbeaches being shut down when such awesome waves were coming. - Yeah, it's interesting\nhow that really brought out the worst in people. - [Andrew] Oh, yeah. And so-\n- I'm not sure why that is. Fear maybe, paranoia.\n(Andrew sighs)"

It's wild. - And both groups think they're fighting for the\nsurvival of something. - Yeah.\n- And so, that's where you really run into problems, when you have two polarized\ngroups who both think that their cause is for the common good.

And everyone says, \"Andrew,\nyou have to go cover this.\" And I'm somebody, like I said, police violence has been close to my heart since I was a kid. And my first thought is, I can't do that. I'm a comedic reporter. I can't go to Minneapolis and cover this. It'll be the end of my career. And I had a friend named Lacey\nwho I went to college with and she told me, she was like, \"Bro, this is your chance for\nyou to do something serious. You can actually create a meaningful piece of reporting like you always wanted to before \"Quarter Confessions\" and you can turn \"All Gas No\nBrakes\" into a new source.\" So, I called Reid who was the CEO of the company that owned \"All Gas No Brakes\". And I was like, look, man,\nI want to go to Minneapolis. I was in Orlando at the time. I was actually at The Sausage Castle. And he said- - Sorry, The Sausage Castle? - Yeah, the Juggalo mansion. - Oh, right.\n- Yeah. - That was called The Sausage Castle. - So, I'm watching\n- Right. - Minneapolis unfold on Lake\nStreet where it was burning. And I got to the Orlando airport and I booked a flight without cons... I booked it on my own card. I didn't consult my boss or anything. And I was sitting in my seat on the flight and he straight up told me, he's like, \"If you fuck this up and this destroys the brand, we're getting a different host. If you mess this up and you turn our show away from a party show\nabout drinking and drugs and all that stuff and you make this a social\njustice show, you're done.\" But I was like, I just\nturned my phone off. I got to the Minneapolis airport on the second night of the riots. And when I got to the airport,\nthere was National Guardsmen in the airport and it was\nlike a \"Call of Duty\" mission, the one in the airport. And on the speaker, they say, \"If you're arriving here right now, you are not permitted to go\nanywhere outside of the airport. National Guardsmen will escort you to your Uber or to your car. They're gonna take a picture of your ID, they're gonna figure\nout where you're going. You are not permitted\nto go outside tonight.\" And so, Lacey picks me up. There's two people in the back, two of her home girls\nwearing like shiesty masks. And I'm like, what are we\ndoing? Where are we going? And she goes, \"We're\ngonna go film the riot. We're going to Lake Street.\" And so, we drive down there, Kmart is burning, Target is\nburning, everything is on fire. She has the Sony A7. She gives me a microphone and she's like, \"Go talk to that guy.\" And that was the guy with a\nMolotov cocktail in his hand who had just burned Kmart down. And so, I go, what should I ask him? She goes, \"What's on your mind?\" So, I walk up to him and I'm\nlike, what's on your mind? He said something like, \"Everything that was happening\nhere was supposed to happen. This is how we feel. Is it right? No. Is this gonna benefit the community? No. But this is how we feel.\" - This is how we feel. That's pretty powerful.\n- Yeah. - Through a lot of the\ndocumenting that you do, this is how we feel is like - [Andrew] Yeah. - screaming through that.\n- Yeah. And I noticed that aside from\na group called Unicorn Riot, there was no one else actually\ninterviewing the protestors. The local news was on\nthe bridge 15, not 15, but five blocks away, filming just the scene\nitself, just the fire. But I saw some crazy\nthings off camera too. I saw, so there was two groups there. There was the anarchists,\nmore mobilized protestors. And then, there was just mostly African American community\nmembers who were just pissed, who had nothing to do with\nthe organized resistance. And they were all joining forces to riot. And there was this anarchist kid who ran up to White Castle\nwith like a Molotov cocktail. And he's about to throw\nit at White Castle. And this Black dude ran up\nto him and grabbed his arm and he's like, \"Nah, we\nfuck with White Castle.\" (Lex laughing) And I was like, what?\n- Yeah. - And so, you see, if you go on Lake Street,\nevery business is burned, - Yeah. White Castle stands.\n- White Castle remains. I also saw these dudes\nrip this ATM out of a bank and hit it with sledgehammers. They were a group of friends\nhitting it with sledgehammers. They're hitting it with\nsledgehammers. Boom. All of a sudden, money starts\nspraying out of the ATM. I've never seen some shit like\nthis, like pouring out of it. And then, this group of friends who were just united and getting it open, start fighting each other for the money as it's flying out of it. And so, there was just, it was like Joker from the\nBatman's army type vibes. But I got shot in the ass\nby the National Guard. It was no good. - Like a what? Rubber bullet?\n- Yeah, yeah. Not shot with bullet.\n- What did that feel like? - Honestly, it hurt. (Andrew and Lex laughing) It hurt.\n- I'm not sure what I was expecting as an\nanswer to that question. - Yeah, but-\n- I liked it. It was good.\n- Yeah. And then, after that, I posted the video and it was very well-received and that was the pivotal point"

      "text": "where I realized that\neverything was gonna change. - There was a still a comedic element to the way you do conversations. So, the way you edit. So, did you see yourself as a potentially like a Jon\nStewart type of character- - At first, but I just think human beings are just funny in general. - Yeah. The absurdity of it. - Cool thing about Jon Stewart is like, I generally like to say that anybody who works for corporate media, whether it be Comedy Central or anything owned by\nTime Warner, FOX, MSNBC, they can't say what they want. - Yeah.\n- Because in order to climb up in those organizations, you have to appease the narrative of the company that you're\nworking for to rise in the ranks. Jon Stewart, I feel like, has so much clout in the media world that I'm pretty sure he\ncan say whatever he wants. I actually don't think that Jon Stewart is controlled by anybody. I really don't. I think that he can go on his\nshow and talk about whatever. - I do think that certain people have broken the brains of... COVID broke the brains of a lot of really great people I admire. Trump broke the brains of\na lot of people I admire. Like to where Trump derangement syndrome became a thing, like\nyou can't see the world - Yeah.\n- quite as clearly, because of it. And I think Jon Stewart is quite a genius at stepping away, even though the world\nneeded him in that time, stepping away during that moment of Trump and coming back now being able to reflect being those,\nthe other statesman. - My favorite Jon Stewart moment that illustrates that perfectly is whenever he went on the Colbert show and he was just joking\naround with Stephen Colbert, who I think, is a full-blown propagandist, about the Wuhan lab leak theory. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - And he was just goofing around and he was like, \"It's\ncalled the Coronavirus lab and they had it before.\" And now, what do we have? And it was like you could\nsee in Stephen Colbert that he was like gun\nto his head type shit. Where he is like, Jon, Jon,\nstop joking about that. - Yeah.\n- And that made me realize like, oh, everything that Jon Stewart did, especially for the 9/11 first responders, he's a true American. And not in the sense of like\nthe different political parties want you to believe as an American, not a do your part in\nsocial distance American, not a wave your Trump flag in the back of your pickup truck American. Just a guy who genuinely\nstands up for what's right. - There is a degree to which\nyou can be in those positions easily captured by groupthink though, - Yeah.\n- even when you're not controlled by bosses and money and all that kind of stuff. And I think Jon Stewart is\nmostly resistant, but it's hard. His position is difficult. - I think he's done the best job though. If someone in that\n- Yes. obviously Democrat connected - Yeah.\n- corporate media economy, he seems to be the freest talker. - Yeah. So, this is when\nyou first became famous."

      "text": "- I'm not even sure what fame means. I just see myself as me. - When did you get the shades? - Oh, that was on tour. That's a whole... (Andrew laughing) The shades, that's dark time. But thi... I didn't make like-\n(Andrew laughing) - This is a meme really. I don't even know if that's a symbol of fame\n- I didn't make - or whatever.\n- journalism to become famous. - [Lex] Yeah. - I made it to give people a platform to share their stories. It just so happens that\npeople liked it enough to where I became famous,\nbut if I could go back and not be the on-camera guy and just platform the stories, I would. But the reality is people need a face to attach to stuff they like. And so, that's just how it is. But yeah, I would say right\naround Minneapolis protest, Portland protest, Proud Boys rally time when I was really in\nthere is when I started to be acclaimed as more than\njust like a ambush meme lord. - Did that have effect on you, the fame? - Not at that point. - Not at that point. So, you were still able to\nhave a lightness to you? - Well, the country was basically closed. - Yeah.\n- So, it wasn't like there was a street to walk down where people were like, there's that guy. So, getting famous, famous during COVID made it so when the country reopened, it was as if like my life really changed, 'cause I was like, oh,\nall these fans I made during COVID are seeing me out of the bar. This is cool. - [Lex] Yeah. - At first, fame is the best thing ever, because you can go anywhere in the country and these spaces that you\nnormally feel a bit insecure in, - Yeah.\n- like a local dive bar, a cool restaurant, a coffee shop where you'd just be another guy, all of a sudden, they're like,\n\"Oh my god, I'm a big fan.\" They give you like free stuff. You get this sense of acceptance that you never would've gotten before, so. But there's also- - The dark side. - Well-\n- It's all love, man. Just to speak to the\nfirst part you're saying, it's just so much love that people have and they share.\n- It's amazing. I'm sure you know what it's like. - Yeah. It's beautiful. - The only downside of fame really is that you can't really\nbe anonymous again. And you have to seek out more strange environments\nto be anonymous in. Right now, I live in the desert basically and I wanna live in the middle of nowhere in the Mojave Desert. Not because I'm scared of people, but 'cause I just wannna\nbe like curious me again, - Yeah.\n- who people don't know and I can ask questions to people that I'm interested in without them going, I seen you here, I seen you there. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - That's the main thing. That's what I loved about hitchhiking. - Yeah, just to have anonymity, for sure.\n- Yeah. It's the best. But both are great. Complaining about fame\nis just the lamest shit. - Yeah. We should go to furry\nconventions that you covered. - Oh.\n- Wear an outfit. - I love furries. I should do that. - Yeah, we should go\ntogether. I go all the time. We should go together. What's your favorite outfit?\n- You've not been to a furry convention.\n- No, I have not. - I think you might like\nit more than you think. - I... (Lex scoffs) Listen, (laughs) maybe I'm just afraid to face who I really am. (Andrew laughing) - Yeah, your persona, the\ntrue Lex will come out when you're in a $3,600\n- Yeah. Everything is possible.\n- lizard suit. - Lizard? Is that what they go with? - Well, scalies are the lizard furries. - Yep.\n- And there's a big division in the community where they\nthink scalies are douchebag, 'cause the scaly suits are more expensive. They're about seven grand,\nwhereas a furry suit is 3,600. And they're also taller.\n- Yeah. - So, when the scalies pull up to the fur fest it's\nlike, ah, fuck the reptiles. - Fuck the reptiles.\nI can get behind that. I'm more like a teddy bear type of guy. - Yeah.\n- I think bear's... What's the... Maybe squirrels. I don't know. - Oh. Squirrels are so cool.\n- Giant squirrels. Yeah. - I wanna put a GoPro on one and just see what the hell they do. - You were talking about that conversation with the guy at the head\nof Doing Things Media. How did that end up? - Well, I want to clear up a few things. Reid, the CEO of Doing Things, I actually think he's a good guy. I think that he was just\ntrying to run a business. He saw what was working for his brand, which is very college-centric,\nvery festival-centric. And he was right to think that journalism and especially coverage of\nsensitive topics like COVID or police brutality would\ndefinitely not work on merch. You're not gonna sell a picture of me interviewing someone\n- Yeah. - at a riot like you would me interviewing a furry or\na drunk dude in Alabama. It doesn't work the same. So, it was a lot harder to monetize, not just 'cause of YouTube censorship, but also just because\nof the sensitive nature of the content. So, Reid was looking out for\nhimself as a businessman. There was a different partner, oh, I'm not gonna say his name, that was more connected in Hollywood. I think he's responsible for\nthe collapse of the show. - What was the collapse like? What happened?\n- So, right as the country's reopening, I get a DM from Eric\nWareheim of Tim and Eric and I'm covering something called the UFO Mega Conference\nin Laughlin, Nevada, which is a beautiful river town. And he DMs me and says,\n\"Let's make a show.\" And I'm like, oh shit, is this real? I grew up such a big fan of \"Nathan For You\" and\n\"The Eric Andre Show\" and those are produced by\ntheir company, Abso Lutely. So, I was like, hell yeah, let's do it. Three days later, I get a call that says, \"Jonah\nHill wants to hop on board.\" And I can't believe this. I'm still in the RV and\nI'm in Laughlin, Nevada. So, I'm like, Jonah Hill of \"Superbad\"? Are you shitting me right now?\n- Yeah. - 'Cause I was excited. Oh, and \"Moneyball\". Jonah\nHill's a great actor. - Oh, he's great. He's great all around.\n- Yeah. - Doesn't get the credit he deserves. Well, he's got the credit by\nnow, but still deserves more. - So, basically, just within a week, I assembled this super\nteam of Tim and Eric and- - \"Superbad\" team?\n- Yeah. Pretty much of Tim and Eric. Sorry, I'm so sorry.\n- No, that's good. And Jonah Hill. And yeah, we just pitched it around. Every single TV network\nrejected it. I don't know why. And they mainly did that, because I was in this weird situation where I had signed a contract\nwith Doing Things Media that I didn't realize\nwas called a 360 deal. That's what they use in the rap world, basically means that I can't do anything outside of them without them getting a hundred percent of the money. So, if I was to go work\nat Sbarro or Quiznos while I was working for\n\"All Gas No Brakes\", they would get my 500 bucks a\nweek from the sandwich spot. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - I was unable to earn any outside income. I didn't read the fine\nprint, 'cause I was 21 and like I told you, 45k\na year, RV sounds sick. - Yeah.\n- And basically, the TV networks were like, why would we buy a show if the digital brand's gonna\nbe running at the same time? 'Cause they didn't wanna stop doing \"All Gas No Brakes\"\nto make a TV show. They wanted \"All Gas\nNo Brakes\" to continue as a web show while \"All Gas No Brakes\" as a future TV show at SHOWTIME or Hulu or somewhere like that was\nalso concurrently running. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - Which is impossible for one man to do. And so, every TV network said,\nokay, we're not doing that. We want an exclusive rights\ncontract with this guy. Next, oh, yeah, this is\ncrazy to think about, 'cause it all happened so fast. So, Jonah Hill says A24 Films wants to do a movie instead of a show and they're gonna let you keep\nthe digital brand running. So, this meant that I could\nkeep doing my Instagram stuff with Doing Things Media\nslash \"All Gas No Brakes\" while making an A24 movie with\nJonah Hill and Tim and Eric. So, it was just like, I was excited. It sound sounded perfect. So, they said, \"Okay, what do\nyou wanna make a movie about?\" And I told them, okay, here's\nwhat's gonna happen in 2020. If Trump wins, there's gonna\nbe riots across the country. The major cities are gonna burn down. If Trump loses, the militias\nand his loyal supporters are going to try to have a coup in DC. That's what I said. And I said, so I'm\ngonna follow the lead up to whoever wins the election and I'm gonna document what happens after. So, they said, \"Okay.\" And so, I was to begin\nfilming in late October, during the campaign trail, maybe mid-October up until November. And then, in the following\nmonths to see what would happen. This meant that I couldn't film anything for \"All Gas No Brakes\", the digital show, because I had to dedicate a\nhundred percent of my time to making this perfect movie.\n- Yeah. Yes. - Still, one of the partners\nat Doing Things Media was demanding that I not\nonly produce the movie, but also more content for the show. And I told them it was only\nso many hours in a day, man. That's gonna be impossible. And I said, if you want it to be possible, I can make it work, but I want to have half of the\nmonetization from the show. 50% profit split, which I thought is fair.\n- Mm-hmm. - If you want me to do double work when I was getting almost nothing before, split me in on the profits. They fired us immediately. Me and my two childhood friends who I hired to work on the show with me we're all out of a job as we were filming for\nthe now HBO project. We got our fire notices. - The guts on that person to... 'Cause you should be owning\nprobably close to 100% of it. - I think so too, but they\ndidn't see it that way, 'cause they figured we made\nthe initial investment, we discovered him is\nhow they looked at it. So, it wasn't Reid, but\nit was the other partner who wasn't Reid who said,\n- Yeah. - \"We have tons of,\"\nverbatim he said this, \"I have tons of connections\nin the comedy world. We can replace Andrew overnight.\" - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - I'm not sure why he\nmade that miscalculation. I wish he would've thought about it twice. I wish he didn't have to\nend like that, but it did. - Why do people do that? What's the benefit of acting like that?\n(Andrew sighs) - [Andrew] I think- - Because you can part\namicably without the drama. - I think all betrayal in anything like that is\nmotivated by self-interest. Whether that be economic success, social stability, whatever it is. They figured that because\nI was being such a burden in asking for the profit, that they could just release me and find someone equally talented and not split them in so\nthey can make more money. - Oh, I see. Well, that's\na stupid way to think. - People think like that,\nman. People who are... (Andrew sighs) The word I use is like sidekick syndrome. When people are a part of the production, but they're not integral.\n- Yeah. - They start thinking that the front man doesn't\nmatter or something. And that the brains of the operation are actually the people on the periphery. And so, they start to believe that they can just shift things around and the audience won't care. Not realizing that I was actually the one who created the show and that the lore of the\nshow is connected to my rise outside of their jurisdiction,\nif that makes sense. The people who watch \"All Gas No Brakes\" watched \"Quarter Confessions\"\nand read the book. And so, you know. (sighs) - Well, this happens also\nnot just financially, but just with people that\nthey're part of a team, but they don't really contribute\ncreatively to the team and they force their opinion or pressure. - [Andrew] Yeah. - Whether it comes from editors\nor all that kind of stuff or from sponsors, there's\npressure they create when the creator alone\nshould be celebrated and have all the power, 'cause they're the ones\n- Yeah. - that are creating the thing. - In a way, I have sympathy,\nbecause I can't relate to that, 'cause I've always been the front man of my\nown projects by design. So, I'm not sure what it's like to be a, like someone's owner from\na content perspective. I don't understand the\nchallenges they face. Maybe there was something\n- True. - that I didn't understand. I don't know.\n- True. Well, oftentimes, if you\nown a thing like this, like this company, you\ndo think about brand. - [Andrew] Right. - And then, maybe you\nhave a big picture idea of what brand means and\nthat can be at tension with the creative project, right? - [Andrew] Yeah. - But ultimately, freedom for the creator is the best kind of brand.\n- Yeah. I remember all three of us who worked on \"All Gas No Brakes\" got fired at the same time. And were in the RV that Tim and Eric's company bought for us, which was a bigger RV, in the parking lot,\n- Nice. - parking lot of a\nWalmart in South Philly. And the propane had just ran out and it was 15 degrees outside. So, the RV was getting\nreally cold really fast. And I just looked at my phone\nand it was like, you're fired. And I was just like, God, help me. But I've had a couple moments like that and God does help me. - And they were always in the\nparking lot of Walmart, right? - [Andrew] Well, yeah. Although... - I know that Walmart, by the way. - The one in South Philly is great. - [Lex] Yeah, that's great. - But technically now, you\ncan't park an RV there. - Well, you're not a man\nwho follow the rules, if you know what I'm saying.\n- Well, the thing is though is Walmart, Cracker Barrel, and Big Five are supposed to technically all let RV campers park overnight. But if there's a crime problem in the city where they're at, they can lobby, individual Walmarts can lobby with the corporate to take that away. So, all the Portland Walmarts, you can't sleep there anymore. Any city with significant homelessness and petty property crime,\nthe Walmarts are a no-go. - Fascinating. So, that was a low point. - [Andrew] Yeah. (Lex chuckles) - But from there, from\nthe ashes to Phoenix Rose, - Over time. Yeah. - Channel 5 was born. - Channel 5 was born in the March of 2021 after we finished filming\nfor the HBO project. - Oh, really? So, you went all in on\nthe HBO project at the- - Yeah. We filmed the HBO project from November, 2020 up until April, 2021, damn near, we were just\npicking up the pieces, going back for individual\ninterviews, stuff like that."

Maybe you can\ntell the story of the film. You have, what's his name? I wrote this down, Joker Gang\nand Gum Gang. Is that correct? - [Andrew] Yeah. The opening scene. - The opening scene of two\ncharacters just talking shit, and then getting into a fight. And I think it was really brilliant how you presented that as\na, almost like a microcosm of the division\n(Andrew chuckles) between the extremes of the left and the extremes of the right. - That's exactly what it was. I'm glad you picked up on it.\n- Yeah. And then, (chuckles) what I really liked is that the Joke, again, Joker Gang was\n- Yeah. - a little bit of a\nspoiler alert, I apologize, but at the end of the film\nwas a voice of wisdom. - [Andrew] Yeah. I just realized- (Andrew laughing) - He seems the most sane. - He was the voice of wisdom. (Andrew laughing)\nHe like cut through it. - [Lex] Yeah. - I also just realized that a lot of people are gonna stream the movie after watching this\npodcast, which is cool. - Yeah. Where do they stream it? On HBO Max. Sorry.\n- Oh, yeah. HBO Max. I never got a chance to promote the movie. - It's such a pain in the ass, man. I wish we could all just pay\non it on YouTube or something. - Yeah.\n- And HBO gets the profits or whatever, but like, it's such a...\n- Yeah. - I have to subscribe\nfor every single thing. But yes, if you wanna\nwatch it, it's really, I recommend, extremely\nhighly sign up to HBO, whatever the hell. - On the positive note,\nHBO is great to work with. They're the most professional, respectful company I've ever\nworked with pretty much. - Like-\n- Yeah, HBO has created some of the greatest TV ever. - But even on in the\nbackground, they get shit done. There's no wait time. They have some of the best\nheavy hitters on their team, for trailers, for posters. All the promotional apparatus\nthey have is super solid. - Did you get good notes from\npeople there? Like how to- - A little bit, man. But you know. - It's a truly original documentary. Meaning like, I just haven't\nseen anything like it. It's even like... So, there's a humor and a lightness at the\nright kinds of moments. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - Like I said, there's\na rooster in your... That's like, okay, that's like a non-sequitur\nthing as part of a storytelling. It intensifies and reveals\nthe absurdity of the division - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - and how once January 6th happens, everybody goes on to the next thing. - Yeah.\n- It's like, what happened to us? It was almost like a delirium that everybody was participating in. Some weird, just like, well,\nlike people say, mind virus. Like all of a sudden,\nwe just got captured. - Yeah.\n- And people just yelling at each other and doing the most ridiculous shit. And really, January 6th, the way you presented especially just reveals the circus of it all. - It really broke the fourth wall, or that's how I would describe it. Because if you were at\nJanuary 6th and the lead up, it felt like it was the beginning to a series of similar riots, but it just popped off\nso much that that was it. You haven't seen anything like it since. It was supposed to be a\nsecond one on January 20th. It was the actual inauguration\nthat never happened. It was a crazy time to\nbe alive and around. And especially the\nrelationship that I developed with Enrique Tarrio, who's the former chairman\nof The Proud Boys. He's now facing 23 years in prison. It's like a trip, 'cause I went to his house in Miami maybe\ntwo weeks after January 6th. And talking to him, it seemed like he didn't think\nanything was gonna happen. He was just like, \"Yeah,\nman, that was crazy. I'm glad I wasn't there. They're dumb for doing that.\" He even told me he doesn't\nthink the election was stolen, - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - which is just a mind fuck. It's like, why'd you get\neveryone so hyped up? (Lex chuckles) It's just weird to think about how so many people's lives are\ndrastically altered forever, because of that just\nbizarre moment in time that will always live on. - Yeah.

That family that I talked to,\nI call them the QAnon family, but it's called the Spencer family. They were nonpolitical up until the Stop the Steal Movement began in September of 2020. And within four months, their entire life revolved around the\nmythology and lore of Q. And I've never seen in my life a psyop just devour people's\nminds in such an intense way, in such a rapid period of time. - And I love how the kids in the movie are also the voices of wisdom. - Yeah.\n- The Spencer family, it's the kid who goes through the full journey\n- Yeah. - of believing that whatever\nHillary Clinton is a lizard and just believing all the worst versions\n- Mm-hmm. - of the conspiracy theories, and then waking up was\nlike, what was the point? - Yeah, it was heartbreaking\nto see his disappointment in his dad for even following\nQanon so militantly. 'Cause he was like, I felt\nlike they let my dad down. I felt like they let our family down, because January 6th was\nsupposed to be the day, according to Qanon, that the storm happens and that the military\nis supposed to mobilize and arrest the members of the deep state, Clinton, Soros, all that.

They think of stuff that\nI'm like, that's clever. - They're like, they have\nsome political depth to 'em. - Yeah.\n- Wow. - is there something more you could say about how QAnon works? Like who's behind it?\n- Man. - What's your sense of who's\nbehind the whole thing? - I don't want this to sound rude or anything. I just don't care about\nQAnon. You know what I mean? I've put so much thought into it and I just can't seem to\ncare about it. (sighs) - Was it almost a disappointment, because to me, it was like a thing that just captured a very\nlarge number of people's minds, and then it just faded. - I guess that's why. It just seems like it's gone. And the ideas of QAnon have just bled into mainstream standard\nconservative thinking. - But there has to be a retrospective. That's the problem I have with COVID. A lot of stuff happened.\nEverybody freaked out. There's a lot of big drama around it. And now, like, oh, okay. Forgot.\n- Yeah. - Just like, moved up. What are the lessons learned? Has anyone learned any lessons? - Yeah.\n- Like what? - Exactly.\n(Lex chuckles) And what I'm saying is I\ndon't want QAnon adherence to see this and think I\ndon't care about them. - [Lex] Yeah. - But as far as who is behind\nit, the damage is done. - Yeah, but what are the\nmechanisms that made it work? That's really-\n- What do you think? Have you thought about that? - I think that these viral\nideas can be driven by, and your film shows this,\nby just a handful of people. And they're not malevolent.\n- Yeah. - They just want the clout. - [Andrew] Yeah. - And there's something sexy, there's something really sticky\nabout conspiracy theories. Especially extreme ones. You just like, some of them\ncan have this momentum. They capture the minds of a lot of people and you just go with it. - Yeah.\n- And it, like, when I hear some conspiracy theories, like there's something, like a small part of me\nthat kind of like, yeah, get excited.\n- It's possible that QAnon is a psyop to distract people away\nfrom actually uncovering - Yeah.\n- what the deep state is and who is truly running\nthings behind the scenes. Because the deep state is just the 1%. You get people so close to any type of class consciousness, and then you totally divert everything into lizard humans who live on the moon and that Hillary Clinton\nis eating babies on camera. And QAnon did just that. They wanna convince you that one, there's no conservative deep state, which is even more hilarious,\nthat Trump isn't connected to a huge rich corporate\napparatus of propagandists. And two, that the democratic establishment is the only deep state. And that some middle of\nthe road conservatives, that there's no grifters or manipulators outside of\nthat three-headed snake. - There's grifters everywhere. - Everywhere, everyone\nwants to make money, dude. This is the world that\nwe're in. It's in collapse. Everybody wants to make money. And engagement is the rule of law. So, anything, that's why\nthese news organizations follow retention incentives. They want to make money by selling ads. So, they try to create\nfear and constant division to enrich corporate media establishment. And you have people who\nare almost realizing, hey, it seems like FOX and CNN, it might be owned by the same people and are tactically using these machines to keep us divided perfectly 50/50 to ensure that the power\nstructure never gets disrupted. Then, you get these people,\nyou know who's gonna save us? Donald Trump, that's the\nguy. How is that the guy? It's not the guy.\n(Lex laughing) And I don't have TDS. I'm not an Orangemen basher who thinks about the guy all the time, but I don't think he's the guy."

      "text": "- You were shirtless lifting weights while whiskey or some alcohol\nwas poured into your mouth by Alex Jones in this movie. And then, you did the same to him. - That's true. Mm-hmm. - This feels like an interrogation. (Andrew and Lex laughing) So, Alex\n- Yup. - was a part of this film. He was like throughout the narrative and you had a great interview with him. What did you learn about\ninteracting with Alex, Alex Jones from making this film? - For one is that he's\nthe exact same off camera as he is on camera.\n- Yeah. - It's not an act. He told me that all real\nAmericans die before 58. He mentioned Sean Connery\nand a few others. And- - How old is he? - Getting up there.\n- Yeah. - Think early 50s.\n- Yeah. - I just found it fascinating\nhow nice his studio is. The guy's got like an MSNBC level set up. - Mm-hmm. - I actually had a great time with him. It's bizarre, because\nhaving him in that movie created so many problems for me. And when I interviewed him, I didn't necessarily portray\nhim in the best light. we joked around a bit, but it wasn't an Alex Jones\nhit piece necessarily. But I like to think that I was a bit critical\nof him in the film, especially the ways that he\nantagonized his supporters to storm the capitol or\nto follow that trajectory. He told me, when I met\nwith him, he was like, \"I know you think that\nhaving me in this movie is a good idea, but you're gonna have\nsome serious backlash because of that.\" At the time, I was like, man,\nit's fine. It's all good. We're just hanging out, drinking whiskey, doing bench presses, drinking Jameson. It's all good. First of all, I had to campaign\nto get him in the film, because the studios were like, we don't... There was a bizarre time around like, I think it was 2018 where deplatforming was the big thing that\npeople were encouraging. It said, giving a platform\nto problematic ideologies will in turn expand their reach, and so even extending your platform to someone who's\nproblematic is helping them, AKA destroying humanity, whatever it was. So, that was the whole thing. And when I did this media\ntraining that was mandated by HBO, it was all training and how to defend from\nthat exact question. They said,\n- Mm-hmm. - \"When we put you on NPR\nand we put you on CNN, they're gonna ask you about platforming problematic ideologies.\" And you're gonna have to say stuff like, sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe that extremism only goes away when you shine a light on it, because leaving it in the dark\nwill only allow it to grow.\" They gave me like 15 pointers. I didn't use any of those pointers, because I'm not the kind of person who wants to be media-trained. I like to speak freely. But in the promotional run for the film, when I went on CNN, this\nwas a crazy experience. So, I went on CNN and\nthankfully, (chuckles) my friend was with me. And so, I'm on CNN and- - By the way, your friend\nis chilling in sunglasses, laying in the couch right now.\n(Andrew laughing) Most, it's like the-\n- That's Larry Suit. (Lex laughing) It's a mix of the dude from \"Big Lebowski\" and the Brad Pitt role in \"True Romance\". - Yeah.\n- You know that reference or-\n- No, but I mean, I'm sure it describes Larry Suit. He kinda looks\n- Kinda look - like Brad Pitt.\n(Andrew drowns out Lex) - [Lex] Jack Kerouac.\n(Andrew laughing) Yeah, (chuckles) yeah. - So, HBO had a press tour set up for me and the main ones\n- Yeah. - were CNN and NPR. And so, they said, \"You're gonna go on CNN on the Don Lemon morning show and he's gonna ask you about your life, what led up to the movie,\nwhat we can expect.\" So, I get in the studio, it's about seven o'clock\nin the morning in New York at his show the night\nbefore at Times Square. So, I'm like groggy-eyed, whatever. They put the lab on me, boom. I'm live on CNN Sunday morning. And he goes, \"How would you describe\nEnrique Tarrio's mental state in the lead up to the\nCapitol insurrection?\" And I'm looking around, I'm\nlike, is this guy serious? (Lex chuckles)\nAm I sandwiched in the January 6th hit piece right now? - Yeah.\n- I thought it was about me. - Yeah.\n- And so, I told him, it's not about Enrique Tarrio, it's about how companies like FOX, MSNBC, and even your station, CNN,\n(Lex breathes out) use the 24-hour news cycle to enrage people to generate ad revenue - Yeah.\n- and pit Americans against each other during times like that. - Yeah.\n- And he said, \"There's nothing fake about CNN.\" And I said, I didn't\nsay you were fake news. I'm not saying you're lying, but you're directly antagonizing and stirring people up\nagainst half the country, because you need money to\nsupport a dying platform. - [Lex] You said that? - Pretty much.\n- Nice. - And\n- Great. I was so... My mom was watching\nand she was texting me. She's like, \"What are you doing?\" And I was like, I don't know. And so, he goes, \"Why'd you extend the\nplatform to Alex Jones?\" And I go, I don't know, I just\nwanted to drink some Jameson and lift some weights with him. At this point, I don't\nsupport that kind of media. I don't support CNN. So, I didn't give them much\ninformation about Alex, but it was very awkward. They never posted the segment online. When I got off of that interview, I had a handler that A24 assigned to me. So, I had someone with me and you could tell she was flustered. She was furious about what I just did. And so, she goes, \"I just got an email from\nTime Warner C-suite.\" And I go, what's Time Warner C-suite? She says, \"I don't know if you know this, but the same people who own CNN own HBO, and it's Time Warner.\" And so, they canceled my press tour. So, my press tour was finished. (Andrew and Lex laughing) All the late night shows\nthat I was supposed to go on. I was supposed to go\non the late night shows and that was off the table, 'cause they were worried that I was like a loose cannon, I think. And then, the only remaining appearance I had left was NPR in Boston. And that was supposed to be a premiere. So, it wasn't supposed\nto be an interrogation. It wasn't supposed to\nbe anything like that. Supposed to be a premiere in front of a live audience\nwhere they watched a film. And I show up after for a Q&A. So, I'm like, all right,\nwhatever. It's weird. They only have this one\npress opportunity left. I felt bad that I ruined\nthe entire press tour by confronting Don Lemon. But at this point, I wanted to just do this final one, especially 'cause it was a viewing. And I was like, cool, I want to... I sat in the audience, I watched people laugh to the film. It was awesome. So, I go backstage and there's an NPR\njournalist waiting for me. And nothing against people who wear masks, but she had two N95s on. Two N95s is- - [Lex] It's a lot. (Andrew chuckles) - It's over the line. So, I go, hey, great to meet\nyou. She doesn't shake my hand. - Yeah.\n- And I go, why not? - And she goes, \"You've\nbeen around some people who I don't want their germs.\" - Yeah. Oh. - And I'm like, okay, okay. This is weird. I thought this is a fun\npremiere for my movie. We sit down. The first thing she asks me is, \"How do you think the Sandy Hook families would feel about you platforming one of the most despicable Americans in history, Alex Jones,\" in\nfront of a live audience. NPR never published this. The only recordings of it are by a fan named Rob in\nBoston who put it on YouTube. It was vertical phone footage. And I literally am like, well, the Sandy Hook family's\nlawyer, Mark Bankston, who represented them in\ncourt in Connecticut, told me specifically that Leonard Pozner, the father of Noah Pozner, who died at Sandy Hook,\nwas a huge fan of the film. And so, I said that to her and that just silenced that conversation. But the rest of the whole conversation was just about exploitation and why are you platforming\nmentally ill people and giving a platform to\nconspiracies like QAnon? Don't you feel like you're\na part of their spread? Someone would call you a\nmisinformation reporter, all this crazy stuff and\nyeah, next day hit the fan. - Fuck all those people. That film, just in case you\ndon't get a chance to see it and you should, you are critical of Alex Jones in the most artful way. It was the correct way to be critical. It showed him to be more\ninterested in the grift of it. - [Andrew] Yeah. - And you didn't do it in\na like a pointing fingers and saying in the NPR way\nthat you just mentioned, but more like a human way. Like this is tragedies\nhappen all over the world and there's grifters that roll in, and then take advantage\nof it in interesting ways. - Yeah.\n- And then, human beings get swept up on either side of it and it's revealing the human,\nthe absurdity of it all. And it was done masterfully. It was done, like for\npeople who criticize you for platforming Alex Jones or whatever,\n- Yeah. - The film from a political perspective is probably leans very much left, - Yeah.\n- like heavily left. But does it without that exhausting energy of judging. - Right.\n- Just this, you know, yeah, two masks judging.\n- Yeah. It was just... (Andrew sighs) When all that was happening, when I was under fire\nfrom the mainstream press for platforming Alex Jones, I thought back to what he said to me, and doesn't mean I agree\nwith everything he says, but he told me, \"You're\ngonna be in trouble with these people if you\nput me in your video.\" And it wasn't too bad of trouble, but definitely, I do think sometimes what the film would've\nbeen like without him. And I think that it was worth it, because his scene is so funny to me and it brings me back to a\ndifferent time in my life. And I'm happy that that scene's out there. - I think it was really well done. - It showed\n- Thanks, man. - the layering of it\nall, the entertainment plus not considering from his perspective, the consequences of rallying\npeople up in this way. That it's not just, you really highlight\nthis in the interview. He keeps saying it's infowars, but then there's always a sense that infowars can turn to\nactual like civil war and- - [Andrew] Yeah. - But maybe not. Maybe\nit's all just a circus. Like we play for each other. - If you look at the speech\nhe did on January 5th, it was said, he said, \"Tomorrow, millions of patriotic Americans\nwill take our country back.\" - Yeah.\n- So, he eggs people on, and then when it gets hot, he steps away. - Yeah. But like you said, the thing he told you, he\nturned out to be right. - [Andrew] Oh yeah. - And the frogs are becoming gay. - They've always been gay. (Andrew and Lex laughing) - Well-\n- Saying frogs are straight is even crazier. - I've read stories where you kiss one and it becomes a prince and- - Yeah, that true. - A hundred percent. You think Alex believes what he says in terms of\neverything he says on infowars? How much of it is real? - He's right about big tech censorship. I think if he's right about anything, it would probably be the heads of big tech colluding together across company lines to\ndeplatform certain people. He's right about that. I think most of the things that he says follow the\nquestion everything narrative, and then everything is like a conspiracy or like a plot or a false flag. I think that he's built up a following for so long that wants him to do that. So, I think he'll question things that he probably thinks are\nrelatively straightforward, because that's the shtick of the show. The infowar is fighting misinformation and people want to see him be that guy. So, to a certain extent,\nif you're a creator who supports your family, you\ndo follow economic incentives and people want you to be the character. And so, you're gonna naturally\ngravitate toward being it. Do you feel that pressure yourself? - I did years ago. Not anymore. I feel like now, I can speak freely and really say what I\nwanna say in my new life. But when I was younger, yeah, I feel like I had to be this\nawkward, amicable, aloof guy who just didn't think\nanything about anything and just was here to listen. But now, I feel more confident\nadding some narrative and voiceover and things like that. - So, for some people especially\nwho publish on YouTube, the YouTube algorithm, they can become a slave\nto the YouTube algorithm. - Yeah. For sure, 'cause... And I definitely feel that sometimes. I know what works for\nme, but I like to think that my audience appreciates\nwhen I try new things, so I'm not totally enslaved to it. - Yeah, I try not to pay\nattention to views or any of that. - Well, you get some high views, so I'll report that for you. (Andrew and Lex laughing)\n- No, I... So, I wrote a Chrome extension that hides all the views\non anything I create. - So, you took it to that level. - Yeah, just 'cause it's a drug, man. And I'm also a number guy. Meaning like, you give me\nlike, if I do 30 pushups today, tomorrow I'm gonna try to do 35, just like enjoying\n- Yeah. - number go up. That's why I like video games like RPGs, where you're improving your skill tree, you're like getting an extra point. And there's some aspect of\nYouTube and other platforms, anything and any other\nplatform, you're like, ooh, I got more today\nthan I got yesterday. That's really, really dangerous to me, because it can influence\nhow much I enjoy a thing. - [Lex] Hmm. - Like if nobody gives a shit about it based on the numbers, you're like, oh, maybe that wasn't such a great experience. I thought it was a great experience, but maybe it wasn't.\n- Yeah. Honestly, I do actually, (chuckles) I feel that way sometimes. I'll put out something\nthat I care about a lot, but if it doesn't get\nas many views, I'm like, all right, it must have not been as good as my higher review videos or whatever. - Yeah. That's just like not true though. - [Andrew] Yeah. - And it might mean on YouTube\nthat your thumbnail sucks or something like this or whatever, however the algorithm works, but that's the thing I'm battling against to make sure I ignore all of that. - Right.\n- And it's actually something Joe Rogan has\nbeen extremely good at. He gives zero shits.\n- Yeah. - And-\n- I think it's easier to do when you're really successful. - Well, he was doing that\nwhen he wasn't successful. - [Andrew] Really? - But anything, he just follows\nthe stuff he enjoys doing and legitimately enjoys it. He happens to be really good\nat it, but he gets good, because he's doing the\nthings he really enjoys and like full on\n- Yeah. - passionate about. And that's why he'll have\nridiculous guests and just- - [Andrew] Yeah. And just like- - Just shit he enjoys doing. - Yeah. That's pretty cool. Maybe I'll one day try to do that. (Andrew and Lex chuckles) For now, I'm too attached\nto the gratification of getting a million views\nin a day and stuff like that. I'm not gonna lie to you and say that I've beat that or something, like. - Well, It's a worthy\nenemy to be fighting, 'cause it's a drug and it's one\n- Yeah. - that should be resisted for a creator, 'cause I feel like\n- Yeah. - it can do negative stuff\nto your mind as a creator. - Oh, yeah, for sure. - Anybody that controls you - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - is not good. - A lot of people are\ncontrolled by their audience. They don't have to have a puppet master on a corporate level. Audience incentive is a different type of, I don't want say slavery, but- - Yeah, it is. And that's why variety is\ngood and you're doing that. - Yeah.\n- Always expanding. Well, let me just zoom out on this. You made a film. - [Andrew] Yeah. - That's pretty cool. - Yeah, it was a great experience, man. It was awesome working with Tim and Eric. Awesome working with Jonah Hill. I feel the same about HBO and A24. Everybody that I worked on the film with, I have a lot of love for and\nI appreciate the experience. It's my first movie. It's a big deal. - [Andrew] That's a good one. - In my head, it's like I finally got to make the transition from\na YouTuber to a filmmaker and that was always this psychic barrier that I felt like I had to jump over. - There's a, I mean,\njust the way it's shot, the humor that goes throughout it, just the narration that you're doing in a shitty director's chair, - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - that was really well done. Whose idea was that? - It was actually Tim and Eric's idea. There was a really great editor named Clay who works for Abso Lutely. And they did all the editing\npretty much in the office. And so, it was Clay's idea to add a retrospective director's chair narrative arc to the whole film. - Yeah, Just like starting\nwith the absurd fight and then going like, oh, that's a good way to start a movie.\n- Yeah. - Just really, really well done. - Thanks, man. - Well, what about Jonah Hill? Like he- - [Andrew] Great guy. - He believed in this. - He did. - So, what's that like? What do you think is behind him believing in such a wild project? - I think that Jonah Hill has a good eye for what's cool\namongst the younger folks. He's into skateboarding stuff. That's why he did that film \"Mid90s\". And I think he probably\nsaw a similar thing in what was going on with\nthe \"All Gas No Brakes\" and was like, shit, this could be big. And so, not only did he\nactually fund the film, he also gave me his agent. And I forgot to mention that\nit was Jonah Hill's lawyers that he gave me for free that got me out of my contract eventually with Doing Things Media or freed me up to speak\nabout what happened. - So, he was also part of you\nkinda gaining your freedom. - Yeah, in a weird way. Even though him and I\ndon't talk that much, just 'cause he's doing his own thing, Jonah Hill is a huge factor\nin my current success and just everything that\nI've been able to accomplish."

      "text": "- Just on your own politics, is it fair to say that\nyour politics leans left? - I'm not really sure sometimes. I like to think that I am socially left. I think people should be able to dress and act like however they want. I don't believe in restricting people's social freedoms. Economics-wise, It doesn't seem like leftist economic\npolicy works very well on a city funding level. Like if you see what's\ngoing on in California, it seems like the city leadership is mishandling the\nfunds in California too. So, I don't know about\nthat, but I don't know, I don't really see\nmyself as left or right. I just never have. - Well, if you just objectively zoom out and don't have an insane\nstandard of the extremes, - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - it feels like a lot\nof your work leans left. - I tend to lean toward like\nthe empathetic perspective, which I do think is more\non the left and the right. But I also, I'm not into\nsuper like PC stuff. I don't believe in limiting\nfree speech either. I don't believe that... I believe in a free internet, which I think is more\nembraced now by conservatives. - But it does seem that,\nmaybe you can correct me, but I get the sense sometimes that the left attack\ntheir own very intensely. - It does happen. But every\ncommunity has terms of exile. (Lex chuckles) Think about what happens\nin the conservative realm. Like when Black Rifle Coffee company denounced Kyle Rittenhouse,\nthey lost a lot of money too. It's not the right attacks its own too. Think about Bud Light and stuff like date. - Terms of exile, like-\n- I mean, every community has (chuckles) terms of exile. You just gotta know who\nyou're engaging with and you gotta make that\ndecision carefully. - It'd be nice if\nthere's an actual writeup of the things you're not\nallowed to say for each thing. And then, I wonder\n- Yeah. - whose list would be longer. It just does feel like the last list - Right.\n- is a little longer. - If you're a conservative and you have a T-shirt with\na demon on it, say goodbye. You know what I mean?\n(Andrew and Lex chuckles) There's certain stuff that they freak the hell out about. - And conservatives are really\nconcerned about pedophiles. - Yeah. I don't like pedophiles either, but I don't think about it all the time. - It's one of the things\nyou do in the film is confront one of the QAnon folks where his concern is that\neverybody's a pedophile and you showed to him- - Well, calls himself a pedophile hunter and makes videos exposing\ndemocratic elite pedophile cabals and is himself a convicted child molester. There's an old thing that people\nsay that every confession, every accusation is a confession to a certain extent.\n- Yeah. - So, it's bizarre that\nsome people's whole life after a big mistake will revolve around trying to seem like the good guy instead of taking\naccountability for themselves. - [Lex] Yeah. - It's a common thing\nyou see all the time. Like neighborhood watch\npeople, you know what I mean? What made you that? What did you do, bro? That you feel like you have\nto get karmic retribution by doing the reverse. I don't get it.\n- Yeah. Do you think to the degree, you have bias that\naffects your journalism? - No, but with the migrant\nsituation, I don't know. - What was that covering that like? - I just got a lot\n(Andrew drowns out Lex) of hate from conservatives for letting the migrants\ntell their stories about their journey and stuff. - Well, what did you learn\nfrom just going to the border? - Just the sheer desperation that the citizens of the world are in. There's people who truly\nbelieve that America is the only hope for their success and to feed their family. And I think a lot of 'em\nare getting catfished. - Meaning America has its problems too? - It has severe problems.\nThere's extreme poverty here. - But in America, if you just\ncompare to other nations, the level of corruption is much lower to where the opportunity for a person to succeed to rise is higher. - I wish success on\neverybody who comes here, but my thing is the\nexpectation that they have and the American dream propaganda they've been installed with isn't necessarily a reflection of contemporary American reality. So, I'm talking to people\nwho speak no English and say I'm here for a better life. I go, where are you gonna go?\nThey say, \"I have no idea.\" And I'm like, man, that's tough. And you almost think how\nbad are things elsewhere for someone to abandon their family, make this journey across\nmultiple continents, and end up here with no plan? And it just made me realize how sheltered I am to a\ncertain extent as an American. And walking back what I said a little bit, 'cause I was just trying to make a point, - Yeah.\n- But what I think of as bad poverty, like\nlet's say West Baltimore or Ninth Ward New Orleans,\nis nothing compared to what's going on in almost\nhalf of the world, if not more. And so, it just made me\nzoom out a little bit. Sometimes you forget\nabout third world poverty when you live here for so\nlong and you get programmed to believe the worst\nthings that are out there is like Kensington, Philadelphia or Tenderloin, San Francisco. But those are just microcosms of more or less functioning cities. Despite what they might\nlead you to believe, Philadelphia is a great\nplace, so is San Francisco, but there's places where\neverywhere is really run down. - Yeah, and like, people\nfocus on in major cities in the United States like homelessness. Somehow, that's a sign of a fallen empire. - Right.\n- But that's a problem. There's definitely... It reveals some mismanagement\nof cities and government- - Homelessness in Seattle and San Francisco is for sure a result of the housing crisis,\n- Mm-hmm. - especially post-COVID and all the gentrification\nthat preceded it. And it's unfortunate now\nthat the conservative media is saying like, look at Biden's America as if Biden created homeless people. And it's just disappointing, because once again,\nyou're seeing the media use real issues that should\nconcern every US citizen and causing people to point fingers at a different political party as responsible for the\nsuffering of others. - Do you think January\n6th can happen again? - [Andrew] No. I don't think so.\n(Lex inhales) - So, all the lessons were learned? - Yeah, for sure. People\ngot really screwed over. - Don't you have a sense\nthat there's a greater and greater growing questioning of the electoral process\nand all this kind of stuff? - I think that Americans overall are very comfortable with\nour standard of living. I think people like going to Sonic and waiting in their car\nand getting milkshakes. And people like going to the AMC Theaters and they like going ice skating and mini golfing and going\nto the bar after work. I don't think that anyone wants a collapse of the basic structure of the country. Even the most politically divided don't want to see 7/11 go away. We are so comfortable. If you look at other countries, even Europe, look at how they protest. And look at the Arab Spring. Those guys were talking like January 6ers and they actually took\ncontrol of the government. - Yeah.\n- And so, think about even if the MAGA crowd took over the capitol\nbuilding, it's just a building. I don't know.\n(Lex chuckles) I just think that Americans, when they talk about civil war stuff, it's just so, we're so far from that. Even if the rhetoric is as divided as it was in 2020, it won't happen again. - For it to really happen, there has to be a level of desperation. - There has to be a level\nof economic desperation that's causing people to starve or some basic resource going away. Water, something like that. - Who do you think wins, Trump or Biden? - In the civil war? - Well, we don't like\n- No, - the guns.\n- in the game of \"Mario Kart\", no.\n(Andrew chuckles) In the (chuckles) election 2024. - Oh, man. I have no idea, man. I don't even know if I'm gonna vote. - It's weird that this is our choice. - I know. I wish people were more\nfocused on city politics. I'd rather vote like yes\nor no for a bike lane in my neighborhood than I\nwould for the president. - So, local politics to you is where it is.\n- I think the- - And you feel it. Yeah. - Oh, your vote actually matter. Let's say you have a\ncommunity of 500 people and you live in Henderson, Nevada. You can influence whether\nor not there's a bike lane or this is gonna be a\nplayground or an ampm. You get to choose and you can\ninfluence a hundred people to choose and boom,\nthis is your community. You can't influence the\nresult of an election. - Still that those at\nthe presidential level, it sets the tone of the country. And so, Trump running again\nand Biden running again, it just feels like\nthere's going to be a lot of questioning of election results. - I just can't believe those are our guys. - [Lex] Yeah. - That's really our guys? (Lex chuckles) That's where we're at? All these smart people\nwe have in this country. The great history. - We got Joker Gang versus Gum Gang. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - Where'd you find Joker Gang? - Well-\n- Is he a legit Juggalo or is he just-\n- No, no, no, no. Joker Gang is like a Miami Cuban guy. - [Lex] Oh. - It's Joker 305 rawest Chico alive. So, me and...\n(Lex chuckles) I had been following him for\na long time on Instagram, 'cause he used to post videos\nof himself popping Percocets and smoking blunts on\nthe toilet freestyling. - Yeah.\n- And so, I had followed him for a while. And then, I finally got this platform and I said, oh my god, I bet you now that we\nhave a million followers, Joker Gang will sit down with us. And lo and behold, the clout did its thing and there I was face to face with the man."

      "text": "- There was a controversy a year ago where a woman came forward and said that you were pushy with her. You respected and know\nyou got the consent, but you were pushy about it. - Mm.\n- Looking back, can you tell the story of that? What are the lessons you learned from it? - Yeah, I've yet to speak on\nthis for a lot of reasons. Mostly 'cause it was a hard time and it's a sensitive subject and I've wanted to\nprioritize the reporting. But I think that now I'm\nready and able to do so. Everything started on December 30th, 2022 and that was the release\ndate of the HBO project. Like I told you, we didn't know when\nmovie was gonna come out. We weren't told that it was gonna come out on that date until early November. And so, it was like,\noh my god, here we go. We got a movie coming out. HBO had... I didn't even know it was gonna be them. So, every day for those (chuckles) 50 days to where I received word and\nto the movie announcement or to the movie release, I was like a kid waiting\nfor Christmas morning. You know what I mean? It was like every day, I just... I saw the movie release date as the first day of the rest of my life. - Mm-hmm.\n- And so, I remember the week of the movie release, it was like every day I was like, oh my god, six days, five days, four days. And when it became two\ndays, I was so excited and so honestly anxiety-riddled, because it was such a massive platform that I went out to the desert by myself out in the Mojave, got a\nhotel, and just sat there. And then, movie release day comes, it was supposed to come out at 8:00 PM Pacific Standard Time. I remember it was like 12\nhours left, 10 hours left. And then, 8 minutes\nbefore the movie, at 7:52, or I guess it was 10:52 East Coast Time, I got a text message requesting a portion of my fat HBO check to contribute\ntoward apparently years of therapy bills that\nthis person had accrued after she says that she felt that I pressured her into\ngiving consent years prior. And I was confused, not\nonly because of the timing, but because this is someone that I hadn't seen in years\nor spoken to in years. And I presume that I\nwas on good terms with. So, I didn't respond to the text message. And then, when I didn't respond, about seven days later, this\nperson made some TikTok videos and with the help of some friends, launched an online campaign. They got picked up by\nthe press pretty quickly. - So, what did you feel\nlike when you got that text? - Well, it's tough, because on one hand, I'm not opposed to restitution being part of a private accountability\nprocess for real abuse. If you've hurt someone to an extent that it took them out\nof work or something, I think they're entitled to some money. But unfortunately, as I later learned, this person had legal counsel and this was an attempt to\nbasically create evidence by extracting a confession\nfrom me to use as precedent for a civil lawsuit to the tune\nof a couple million dollars. - It's dark. - Yeah. - How did you meet this person? - Well, I met them when I was 22. And like I told you, I was living in an RV making this show called\n\"All Gas No Brakes\". And I would travel between\ncities every other day. And so, I would basically pick a new city and I got in this pretty bad\nhabit of what I would say is essentially treating\nInstagram like a dating app. I would go to a new place,\nI'd post my location, I'd surf the DMs, and I would\nlook for fans to meet up with. It wasn't always girls. It was just people to party with, 'cause I was also partying every night, but a lot of times, ended\nup being girls and stuff. And so, that's how this situation was. I didn't have sex with this person. Had a consensual encounter that they reached out to me\nabout two weeks after saying, \"Hey, I don't want you to\ntake this the wrong way. But looking back, I\nfelt a lot more pressure to agree than I realized in the moment. I don't think this is any fault of yours. I just think that you\ncame on a bit too strong and I didn't want to let\nyou down, so I gave in.\" That language made me feel horrible. Mainly because if this person had told me, hey, I don't wanna hook up, I would've said, yeah, of course not. I don't want to hook up with someone who doesn't wanna hook up with me. And I think that as fame\nincreased during that time, I think I was just oblivious\nto how people were seeing me, especially those who had\na digital relationship with me prior to me knowing them. And I don't think that I\nhandled that the right way. - Well, thank you for\ntaking accountability. But just to clarify, you got consent? - Yeah, I was the initiatory party in an interaction with a fan who felt it she had to say yes, because\nof, I'm not sure why. I don't know why, but like I said, this person also disclosed to me, they had a history of childhood trauma and were actively being treated for PTSD and that they felt things move too fast for them given their situation. And so, I told her, I said,\nhey, if you wanna reach out, if you wanna talk on the\nphone, I'm always here for you. I'm sorry to hear that. Let me\nknow if we can talk further. About six months after that,\nI was at Sturgis bike week and I remember this day,\nthis was the hardest day. I was just chilling and I\ngot a text from my friend and said, \"Hey, man, you're\ngetting canceled right now.\" And I was like, what do you mean? Did someone find an\nold tweet or something? What are you talking about? And I opened my phone and it\nwas this Instagram story of me, it was like the ugliest\npicture of me you can find. It was like my face open,\nit was like screenshotted. And it said, I remember this specifically, 'cause I just couldn't believe it. It said the ugly loser who hosts \"All Gas No\nBrakes\" is a piece of shit. He knowingly abused my\nfriend and got away with it. If you follow him, I'm gonna\nmessage you and ask you why. So, this person who I don't know, I didn't even know who that\naccusation was coming from. They emailed every production company that I was working with, DMed hundreds if not thousands of people. Just saying that I was this piece of shit and I didn't even know\nwho this person was. So, I was frantically calling and texting every person\nthat I'd seen intimately for the past year and being\nlike, hey, are we on good terms? Is everything okay? And then, I figured out that the person was coming from Florida\nand I knew who it was. And so, thankfully, I reached\nout to the original person who I had the communication with and I said, hey, I think\nthis might've been you, this might've been your\nfriend who posted this. Are we good? I'm sorry. I apologized again. I was like, listen, I feel\nbad that you feel this way. I wanna do anything\nthat I can to help you. Again, I apologize. And she said, \"Apology accepted. I'm sorry, my friend asked if\nshe could post on my behalf. And I'm sorry, I was going\nthrough a lot mentally and I saw your fame increasing. And so, I agreed to let\nher speak on my behalf.\" And we made amends in private. I said, okay, I'm here\nfor you. Let me know. And she said, \"Apology's enough. Thank you for taking the\ntime to speak with me.\" And that was two years\nprior to this text message being sent to my phone eight\nminutes before the movie. So, naturally, I wanted\nto go on my platforms and talk about what was happening, but I also didn't wanna mess\nup the rollout of the movie, and so the PR firm was like, \"We got this. We'll handle this for you.\" And that was, I guess by way, of a TMZ thing that said\nAndrew Callaghan is devastated. I'm not sure why they thought that that was gonna make\npeople be in my favor. But it was just a picture\n- Yeah. - of me on NBC that said, Andrew Callaghan,\ndevastated by allegations. That was their plan, I guess, to show that I was\nremorseful or something. - How much of this do you think lawyers pushing this when money\nand fame are involved? - Well, I wish I could say the lawyer, but I just can't, that\nwas involved in this. But I will tell you that I try to lean away from resentment and toward accountability completely. What was my role in the situation? How can I never make someone\nfeel like that again? What can I do? What changes can I make\nto make sure that, one, I never treat someone this way, and, two, to never be\nin that position again. - Well, again, thank you\nfor taking accountability. - And the main reason I talk about that is because it wasn't just that person. There was multiple people who made videos reporting\nsimilar behavior. And so, it's obvious that that was a pattern\nof behavior of mine. And so, I made the\napology video to announce that I was taking some time away, because I just needed time away. My entire support system collapsed. My friends at the time disappeared. I was getting obituaries\ntexted to my phone that were like, hey, it's\nbeen nice knowing you. It was great to see you grow. Good luck. Like I was dead. And yeah, it got dropped from my agency. No one gave me tough love. No one called me to ask\nme if I was all right. It was just only everyone\ndisappeared in a week. - Again, thank you for\ntaking accountability, but I just hate how many\ncowards are out there. Like when people\n- Yeah. - hit low points is when you should help, when you should stand with them\nif you know their character. - Yeah. And it was just... It was hard to separate\nthe initial situation that I knew was more or less a setup and the possibly genuine other accounts. And so, it was like, all\nright, you know what? At this point in my life, I wanna be on the right side of history. I don't wanna be the\nanti-cancel culture mouthpiece. I don't have the mental\nstrength to fight this. Especially because I was\nenvisioning the HBO drop to be this like, the world\nopens up to me moment and it was just the reverse. But it wasn't so much the media reporting on it that hurt me. It was just little stuff\nlike a childhood friend that you love seeing, they\nunfollowed you on Instagram. Or just seeing someone on the\nstreet that you grew up with and waving at them and they\ndon't do anything back. And you're just like, oh my\ngod, man, this is my new life. But what are you supposed to do? Thankfully, I somehow two weeks after, I met an amazing partner who\nI'm still with to this day. And I was able to conquer\nmy two biggest fears, which is monogamy and dogs. I was terrified of dogs and terrified of having a girlfriend. Now, I have a girlfriend\nwho I love and two dogs. (Andrew sighs) So- - What was the lowest point? - Well, right after this happened, I entered like a recovery programs. Started with AA, but then I\nfound a more specialized program that dealt with the issues\nthat I was dealing with. I'd say the hardest point was logically deducing that the lives of my loved ones would be better off if I was gone, you know what I mean? And thinking that my mom and my friends, that their life would be better if I took myself out of the picture. And for one, I just figured,\ntheir friend's canceled. Her son is a disgrace. My family's gonna think\nthey raised me wrong and my friends, I'm a social\npariah now, I'm a burden. I'm better off dead. And the hard part was I would read stories and books written by parents\nwho lost their kids to suicide and they reported feeling a\nlot of anger after the suicide. So, I tried to think of\nwhat's the way I can do it to get the least amount of anger on behalf of the people who would grieve. 'Cause the hanging,\nsomeone will discover you. So, I figured that\ndrinking myself to death would be the way to do\nit, and I wasn't able to. Yeah, that was just a dark place. I remember hating the people who loved me, because I knew they would grieve and that made me mad, if that makes sense. I was ready to go. I had no will to live. But their grief was like,\nI didn't wanna cause that, because I didn't wanna hurt them. So, I was like, I hated\nthe people who loved me, 'cause they were stopping\nme from taking my own life. And it's weird to think that\nwhen I was going through that, if you walk by me in the street,\nI look like a normal guy. And so, now, when I walk\naround and I see people, I think to myself, you have no idea what that\nperson is going through. It's crazy that so many people are suffering in complete silence and they don't wear it on them. - Many of the people you\ntalk to are probably that. - Yeah.\n- Many people you've interviewed before,\nall this and after, are probably going through some shit. - I also thought if I could write down what I just told you on a piece of paper and I was to do it and\nthen they found the note, they would take it more seriously, 'cause they would know\nthat I wasn't lying. - [Lex] Yeah. - But then, if you do it, it reduces the lifespan of\nyour parents by 15 years. So, I looked at it like I was\ntaking time away from them. - Well, thank you for the most part, leaning towards accountability,\nit's the right path to take. What advice would you give to young men that look up to you on\nhow they can be good men, especially in regard to women? - If you have any kind of platform, doesn't have to be famous on Instagram, it could be like if you're a pillar of your community in the\nculinary world or whatever it is, just be hyper aware of that and remember that you are\ninheriting a power dynamic that can create situations where there might be some pressure that you don't even realize is there, but it's definitely there, and you just have to be aware of that. And two, when meeting new partners, having hookups and stuff like that, just try to have a\ntrauma-informed conversation about their past. Really know the experiences\nand the backstory of what a new partner has gone through in\nthat world of intimacy. Whatever they're comfortable\nto share obviously. But I would advise\nagainst one-night stands. I would advise against\nhooking up with someone that you're meeting for the first time. Have those conversations prior, because even though it might sound like a\nvibe killer, it's not. And if you think that that\nconversation is a vibe killer, you probably shouldn't be in that situation in the first place. Especially now how\nhypersexualized things are and how common that type of violence is, you need to be able to\nhave those conversations and stop and say, hey, tell me\na little bit about your past. Is there any triggers that\nmake you uncomfortable? Let me know how I can be\nthe best partner to you. And I'm sure that college-aged people are not having those conversations, but I'm sure that it would go a long way. - So, especially when\nyou're young college-aged, you don't have enough\nexperience to be able to read a person without\nhaving that conversation. 'Cause a lot of times, you can see the trauma without\nexplicitly talking about it. - Yeah.\n- That takes experience and knowledge and seeing the world. When you're young, you\nreally don't know shit. Making things a bit more explicit is probably better.\n- Yeah. And also as men, we're trained to believe that it's our duty to\nbe the initiatory party in any type of sexual encounter. Like, oh, like man chases\nwoman. You know what I mean? You have to be the one to make the move or like she's playing hard to get if she's resistant to your\nfirst compliment or something. I think that that's not\nalways how it has to be. And that extra caution needs to be placed if you're taking the initiatory\nrole in an interaction, especially if someone has\na traumatic background. They might agree to do something with you, because they're scared and you might not realize\nthat's what's going on. But because you don't see\nyourself as a predatory person. You don't see yourself as someone who would ever consciously\nmake someone uncomfortable or cross a boundary. But people have histories\nthat you might not understand. And for me, as someone\nwho doesn't have much, honestly, like childhood\ntrauma or anything like that, it's been an interesting year for me working in therapy and elsewhere, understanding how that affects the mind. And also, I understand that\nhurt people hurt people and that someone with\na traumatic background isn't going to have sympathy for applying that traumatic\npain to someone else, even if that person isn't the cause of what\nput them in that spot."

      "section": "Channel 5",
      "text": "- If we can go back to Channel 5, can you tell the origin story of that? - Yeah, Channel 5, during\nthe \"All Gas No Brakes\" days, we used to tell people that\nwe were called Channel 5 if we wanted them to stop antagonizing us\nwhile we were filming. 'Cause every town has a Channel 5. So, when people were\nlike, \"What's this for?\" If they were being super rude and trying to get in the\ncamera and be hella obnoxious, we would just say, oh, we're Channel 5. And they would be like, \"Oh,\nmy grandma's gonna see that.\" And they would leave us alone. So, Channel 5 was a diversion tactic during \"All Gas No Brakes\". And it just so happened that\nwe were in Miami Beach one time and this kid came up drinking liquor, trying to yell about whatever they yell about in Miami Beach, like titties or whatever. And we're like, bro, this is Channel 5. Be careful what you say.\nAnd he was like, \"For real?\" And he just walked off. And I said to my friend at the time, I was like, that sounded\npretty good, right? - Yeah.\n- The Channel 5. And he goes, \"That does\nsound pretty good.\" He's like, \"That's gotta\nbe trademarked though.\" No. (Lex laughing) It's not trademark. - Yeah.\n- It's crazy, right? There's a Channel 5 in every city, Channel 5 KTLA, Channel\n5 Seattle, KOMO News. Dude, Channel 5 itself, we own it. (Andrew and Lex laughing) - Yeah.\n- \"cause no one's thought of something that simple. 'Cause you'd think you'd have to specify. We own channel5.com,\nchannel5.news. Dude, we own it. It's awesome.\n(Lex laughing) - So, it was the same kind of\nspirit as the previous thing. - [Andrew] Yeah. - What was the first one you\ndid Under the Channel 5 flag? - Miami Beach spring break. (Lex chuckles) - I think I've seen that.\nAnd it's gonna be a callback. I think somebody mentioning\neating ass there too. - [Andrew] That would be the place. - I believe that was- - There's only about five places in the US where people yell about eating ass all the time.\n- Mm-hmm. - Bourbon Street,\n- Yeah. - South Beach, Miami,\n6th Street in Austin, Broadway in Nashville, and I'm just gonna go\nahead and say Times Square. You might not think it, but. - Times Square. Really? - Yeah. They yell about ass there. - Times Square. - I would say Beale Street in\nMemphis, but it's not good. - Oh, yeah. (laughs) - Beale Street is like the median age is too high on Beale Street\nfor anyone to yell about ass. (Lex sharply inhales) (Lex sighs) - Oh, this is a fascinating portrait of America through that specific lens. So, Miami Beach.\n- Yeah. - And then, how would\nyou describe your style of interviewing just now that\nyou've collected so many? If you had a style, how would you describe your style?\n- I guess before especially, it used to be like deadpan. Now, I would describe it as more directed, but still relatively affable, agreeable, deadpan interview style. - Yeah, there's a, like\nin the face of absurdity. - Yeah.\n- You're just like there with a microphone. There's a comic aspect to it. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - And that's intentional.\n- Yeah. I used to look at the camera like Jim from \"The\nOffice\" back in the day. - Yeah.\n- I don't do that anymore. - What about the editing? How do you think about the editing? - I still do most of it,\nbut Susan helps a lot too. It's my associate. Yeah, the editing style, like I said, we pioneered this editing\nstyle that honestly, was inspired a bit by Vic Berger, but we took it to real life. Crash zooms, chopping up vocals a bit to add comedic timing where\nit didn't necessarily exist. You might add two seconds\nof awkward silence that are built with room tone or you might make everything really fast by cutting silence and switching frames, I mean switching camera angles. But now, we try to be\npretty straightforward, 'cause we wanna be taken more seriously. (Lex chuckles) - Yeah, sure. What's\ncrash zoom, by the way? - A crash zoom is when the,\nlike it's artificial zoom that you might add in Adobe Premiere, where the camera zooms\nin on someone's face. - Where the resolution is not there. - The resolution's not there unless you have like a\nBlackmagic cinema camera. - Which you don't. - We don't. We don't use those. The file size is too big.\n- Make it slo-mo. The file, that's the only constraint? - Yeah.\n- Okay. - A hundred percent. - And you also do voiceover storytelling. - I think the first time I really did that was in the San Francisco Streets video, because there's so much content about San Francisco homelessness,\nTenderloin shoplifting. But there's not that much\ncontext in those videos about the history of San\nFrancisco, the housing crisis, nimbyism, random zoning\nstuff that sounds boring, but has a major role in the current situation\non the streets there, as to why the Tenderloin\nneglected by police and by the city council and the other neighborhoods\nlike Knob Hill, and North Beach are so nice. So, I added that purposely\nto the San Francisco video and then also to the\nPhiladelphia Streets video to accentuate the reporting and add some historical analysis. - What's your goal with\nsome of these videos? Like the Philadelphia Streets one? Is it to reveal the full\nspectrum of humanity? Or is it also to tell a\nstory that's almost political about the state, or is-\n- Well, number one is always humanization. That's the primary goal, is to\ntake people in circumstances where they're often news items and remind the public\nthat these are people with lives and concerns\nand dreams just like you. But secondly, we also wanna start introducing more\nsolution-oriented journalism. So, not just, oh my god, I'm becoming aware of\nhow horrible this is, but what can you actually do to help? And as you can see with\nthe Vegas tunnels video, people are responding\npretty positively to it. Here's how you can maybe\nhelp a homeless neighbor, help get them an ID, help\nthem qualify for housing, or get a job at the scrap yard. There's always ways to help. But so much of the YouTube\nworld is oversaturated by just endless videos\nof people suffering. And the comments are always\nlike, wow, so horrible. But what does that really do for somebody?"

      "section": "Rap",
      "text": "- You've interviewed many rappers. - [Lex] Yes. - Educate me. - There's a lot to it.\n- Yeah. Can you explain this drill rap situation? What is drill rap?\n- It's an evolving situation. Drill began in 2010. Some people say it was\nChief Keef in Chicago. I think it was King Louie in Chicago. But I think all of it was very influenced by Waka Flocka Flame, who dropped an album\ncalled Flockaveli in 2010 that was hyper violent,\nadrenaline-boosting rap music made by people who were\nactually in the streets. So, in the '90s, you had 50 Cent, you had rapers rapping about\nwhatever gangster shit, selling crack, and beating people up, but they weren't actually doing it. Drill has a true crime\ncomponent to where drill fans want to know that the person rapping about catching bodies\ndoes in fact kill people. So, drill is, it's pretty horrifying. It sounds great, but\nit started in Chicago, then it spread to England, and now it's bounced back to New York, like the Bronx and Brooklyn specifically, and spread from New York\nto the rest of the country. So, now, there's probably a drill rapper every 10 square miles. - So, these are, as opposed to pretending to be a gangster and killing people, you get some credibility\nby actually doing it. - Yes. And the fans are typically not in the communities that\nare affected by poverty. So, they're like\nsuperheroes to White kids. (Lex chuckles) - It's dark. - And not just White kids, but just anyone who's not in the hood. It's not necessarily a race thing. There's White drill rappers too. Slim Jesus was a big one. He's out of the picture now, but there's White drill rappers. - Slim Jesus."

      "section": "O Block",
      "text": "You made a video on O-Block.\n- Yeah. - What is O-Block? The place, the culture, the people, you- - O-Block is a housing\nproject in South Chicago, in the Englewood area where\nMichelle Obama grew up. It's also where Chief\nKeef was born and raised. I don't know if he was born\nthere, but he was raised there. And he is the forefather of modern drill music as we know it. So, these are the projects\nwhere Drill began. It's also the first place where\nyou have that intersection of drill music and true crime, because O-Block has a lot of rappers. And then, nearby is an\narea called St. Lawrence AKA Tookaville, which has\na lot of rappers as well. And so, these two rival\ndrill gangs basically have a lot of history and it\nconnects to music at large. - So, you've interviewed people there. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - Was there any concern for your safety? - No, I think that O-Block\nhas calmed down a lot. For one, it has security, so you can't even really get in and out. But two, I think that O-Block's trying to rebrand itself a lot,\nbecause it could be, 'cause Lil Durk's avoiding a RICO charge. Could be for a variety of reasons. I know you don't know\nexactly what that means, but. (Lex laughing) - Lil Durk-\n- Rapper Little Durk is affiliated with O-Block.\n- Yep. - And a lot of people have been murdered in retribution for\nkillings that Lil Durk may or may not have influenced\nthe ordering of, but anyways.\n- And Lil Durk (Andrew chuckles) documented the killings via rap music probably.\n- No. Okay, I know you don't know about drill, but Lil Durk was associated\nwith a rapper named King Von. And King Von perhaps paid\nfor the assassination of a rapper named FBG Duck who got killed in Chicago's\nGold Coast neighborhood. It's possible. The O-Block 6 are drill-associated, not rappers, but just shooters, and they perhaps operating\non King Von's behalf, went and killed FBG Duck. King Von was Lil Durk's\nartists. King Von's now dead. So, there's a definitely a concern that some of the Fed\ncharges will fall on Durk. Not sure if that's true, but it's rumors in the hip hop community. So, O-Block right now,\nand when I film the video, is trying to go through\na major image rehab. If you go on any Instagram\nof anyone in O-Block, they've all converted to Islam. And so, they post pictures of themselves praying in the morning and have captions like, put\nthe guns down, let's pray. So, I think when I went there, they saw it as a good opportunity to\ndo a positive rebrand. And so, I interviewed a\nrapper named Boss Top, who was there all the way back in 2011 when Chief Keef was coming up. And so, he basically\nensured my safe protection. But he didn't even need to. They're all very friendly and they know exactly what's\nup with YouTube stuff. - I like how 2011 is the\nold days, like the ancient, - Oh, yeah.\n- the founding fathers. - [Andrew] I was in eighth grade. (Andrew and Lex laughing) (palm taps) - Oh, man. Time flies\nwhen you're having fun. - [Andrew] It sure does. - Lil Durk. Where's the Lil Durk now? - [Andrew] Atlanta. - Hmm. So, you left Chicago. - Yeah.\n- Not safe. - Yeah, every rapper has\nto leave their hometown. It's what I did. - It's a journey. (Andrew and Lex laughing) - Seattle would've taken me out, bro. - You do interview a lot of people. That's like a top comment, but it speaks to the reality of the fact that you always find somebody\nrapping or you, yeah, you create the space for people to rap. - Yeah.\n- What's that about? - I don't know, man.\n- Well, they're usually really good. - [Andrew] You think so? - I appreciate it. - Well, hell yeah, man. - Rappers,\n- In their own way. - since I touched a microphone, rappers have gravitated toward me. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - I think there's something happening- - You're a rapper whisperer? - I think there's something happening on a deeper cosmic spiritual level - Yeah.\n- that lets the mind of rappers know that\nthey have a safe place in front of our camera crew."

Free-\n- Yeah, for sure. - That's an intense interview.\nPeople should go watch it. People should go watch\nall your interviews, but that one is pretty intense. - [Andrew] Thanks. - I was a little afraid for your life. - Oh, Crip Mac's the\nsafest guy in the world. - [Lex] He's a sweetheart. - Oh, definitely, dude.\n- Yeah. But it's fun. - I feel more safer on Crip Mac than I do with any given pedestrian. - Yeah, he was loud and flavorful, - Yeah.\n- I should say. So, who's he? What's his story? - Well, his name's Trevor. He grew up in Ontario,\nCalifornia in the Inland Empire. Moved to Texas with his\nmom after his dad left. His mom started dating a cop\nfrom Houston named Mr. Gary. His mom found Mr. Gary getting anally penetrated by a coworker, and so she booked Crip Mac a one-way Greyhound ticket to\nLA where he joined the Crips. - That's a good story. (Andrew and Lex laughing) (companion faintly speaks) - It's true.\n- Oh, you've jumped right to Mr. Gary\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.\n- in 10 seconds- - Yeah.\n- So good. - I'm just saying that he's a classic case of somebody without a father\nfigure who found camaraderie and sense of belonging and purpose in a street gang, which in LA is like a rule\nof law in most of the city. - I forget what context earlier, talking about martial arts and fighting and he's gotta work on\nhis punching for him. - Yeah, I think so. He gets into a lot of\nfights in jail though. And from what I've heard, he wins about half of them,\n- He does that? - so (faintly speaks)\n- All right. What'd he go to jail for now? - Firearm possession. It\nwas a probation violation. - [Lex] Oh. - It's too bad. - All right. So, Philly, you went to the border, - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - occupy Seattle protests,\nyou went to Ukraine. - [Andrew] Yeah. - What are some interesting things that stand out to you from memory? Just as I asked the\nquestion, some interesting- - I was in jail at the border for a while. That was horrible. - [Lex] What was that like?\nWas that your first time? - Yeah, well, I didn't know that I couldn't hop my\nown border as an American. I'm thinking, this is my country. I can get in any way that I want. Wrong. You can only enter the US through an official port of entry, which I learned the hard way, 'cause I got arrested by border patrol and held as a detainee at a\nmigrant center for a few days. - What was that like? - Horrible. - [Lex] Which aspect? - Well, for one, I don't know. It was just to be in a place like that and I probably sound like\nsuch a wimp right now, 'cause I know someone's watching this who's done some hard time. But we thought we were gonna\ndo at least six months in jail, 'cause the guards freaked us out and were like, \"You're being\ncharged with a federal crime. You know what you boys did is serious. We're waiting on word from San Antonio about whether or not we're\ngonna extradite you.\" So, we're just sitting\nin these cells alone, most of the time in solitary\nwith no pillows, just a- - [Lex] No pillows. - No pillows, no mat, nothing.\n(Lex laughing) Just a space blanket. And\nI was sleeping on my shoes. - Yeah.\n- Stinking up the place. It was no good."

      "section": "Aliens",
      "text": "- You mentioned the UFO convention. - [Andrew] Yeah. - What have you learned from\nthose guys? The ufologists. - I really wanna know\nwhat you think about that. That's the one question\nthat I wanna reverse on you, because you've talked to so many people. Do you think that aliens\nhave actually visited Earth? - Yeah, so.\n- When? - When? Exact dates? I do... I think there's alien\ncivilizations everywhere and I talk to a lot of people\nthat have doubts about it. I just think... I even suspect there's a intelligent alien\ncivilization in our galaxy. And I just can't imagine\nthem not having visited us. So, I lean on that. What that actually looks\nlike, I don't know. The stuff we're seeing in\nterms of UFO sightings, I think that's much more likely to the degree it's real, it's much more likely government projects. So, military, Lockheed\nMartin, this kind of stuff. - So, you think that they\nhave knowledge of it? - Yeah, yeah. - One thing I think about\nwith aliens is scale. So, we have this idea that an\nalien would be a gray alien or a almost humanoid lookalike that would visit us in human\nform, arms, legs, head. But who's to say that they're\nnot able to shrink down to microscopic size with\nthe same neural capacity? - Yeah. Or just have a very\ndifficult to perceive form. - But they would go small, not big. - No, I think that would\ntake a humanoid-like form just to be able to\ncommunicate with humans. I think that the big challenge with aliens is to be able to find a common language. So, if you come to another planet and you suspect that there's some kind of complexity going on, but it looks nothing like humans, you have to find a common language. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - And I think aliens would try to take physical form that's similar, - Yeah.\n- that us dumb humans would understand. - Language is really interesting too. I have this series that I'm gonna announce for the first time on here, but I'm really interested in\nendangered languages in the US. There's like 150 languages in the US with less than 1,000 speakers. - Wow.\n- And I wanna help spearhead efforts to\npreserve some of these. Like for example, Hawaiian sign language, 15 of those people left. - [Lex] Holy shit. - Because when Hawaii got annexed, the ASL community tried to make it, so the deaf native Hawaiians wouldn't be able to speak\ntheir native sign language. And so, they would do it under the desks at schools for the deaf and blind. And they would get their mouth washed out with soap and stuff if they so much as did\nthe Hawaiian hand signs. Also, the Gullah Geechee language in the South Carolina Sea Islands. Hilton Head Island and\nstuff, that's like a, it's almost a Creole language\nthat's been in the US for hundreds of years\nexisting in isolation, that's being threatened by\ngolf course developments. I don't know how into language you are, but I've been getting\nsuper nerded out about it. - Actually, I'm interviewing\nsomebody tomorrow who's an expert in human language. He's from MIT, studying the\nsyntax of a lot of languages, including in the Amazon jungle, the peoples that live in\nthe Amazon jungle region. Yeah, it's fascinating. Human\nlanguage is fascinating. And also the barriers that creates. And also how the games are played to what you're speaking by governments. This is part of the story\nof Russia and Ukraine is a battle over language. The Ukrainian language is\na symbol of independence, which is why they are trying to make it the primary\nlanguage of the nation. - Mm-hmm.\n- And so, sometimes, the language represents the\nculture and the peoples. - Yeah.\n- And it's like intricately tied to the culture\n- Yeah. - of the people. - I've been trying to learn Navajo. - Which languages do you know? - Spanish and English. - Spanish well? - Si. (Lex laughing) - I don't know Spanish that well. So, that passes me. Yeah, dude,\n- Okay. - you're fluent based-\n- That means yes. - Oh, it doesn't.\n(Andrew chuckles) Hola. (Andrew and Lex laughing) - That was good.\n- Yeah. - That was real Cancun spring break. - Well, I actually speak fluent Spanish according to Spotify, 'cause every episode is\ntranslated over dub by AI in Spanish.\n- Oh my god. - [Lex] Yeah, there's a very- - You have a Spanish\nrobot assigned to you? - As a Spanish robot, I sound like incredibly intelligent and intellectual in Spanish. - Not a Fridman. - Exactly. (Lex chuckles) From everything you've done,\nall the people you've seen, do you think most people\nare good (inhales) underneath it all? - Yeah. - So, the ones that do\nall the extreme shit- - Okay, I'll put it like this. Most people think they're doing the best\nthing for the world. I don't think anyone, except for maybe a small\nfraction of sociopaths, wakes up every day and says, I'm gonna fuck somebody's life up today. I think the far majority of people are fighting for what they think is right and do want to see America succeed and want us to be in a happy place where no one is subjugated. I just think people have\ndrastically different ideas of what means will get us there. And unfortunately, that's leading to a lot of misunderstandings between cultures. And yeah, I think that\nmost people are good. I've been through some things\nthat leads me to believe that a lot of people though are primarily motivated by self-interest. And that in a fight or flight situation, most people will choose flight. So, I don't know if people\nare courageous as a whole, but I think generally good. But the energy to stand up for what's right, I'm not sure about that. - They have the capacity though - Yeah.\n- to do good. - I think human beings are\ninherently selfish as well. But I don't think that\nselfish is inherently bad. I think humans are primarily\nmotivated by self-interest, but generally have positive intentions. - I do hope more humans\nrise to the occasion and have courage, courage of their convictions,\ncourage to have integrity. But yeah, I think that\nmost people are good and they want to do good and they have the capacity\nto do a lot of good. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - That's why I have hope for this whole thing we got going on. How do you heal the misunderstandings between people you think? - Listening. It's the only option we have. No forced education, no forced meetings or mediations between political opponents. Just listen to more\npeople and really listen. Try to get rid of whatever\npreconceived notions you might have about how you should feel about someone you are\nsupposed to disagree with. And just keep your ears\nand your heart open to people that you don't know\nand your life will change. - Keep your heart open. - A lot of people are scared to listen. - Well, Andrew, I'm a big fan and thank you for being one of the best listeners in the world. - Hey, man.\n- And showing the full spectrum of humanity to us, so we can listen as well and learn. And just thank you for doing\neverything you're doing. Keep me-\n- Hey, man, thanks so much for having me on. You're a great man.\n- Thank you, brother. - I appreciate it. - Thanks for listening to this conversation\nwith Andrew Callaghan.

We're going to Lake Street.\" And so, we drive down there, Kmart is burning, Target is\nburning, everything is on fire. She has the Sony A7. She gives me a microphone and she's like, \"Go talk to that guy.\" And that was the guy with a\nMolotov cocktail in his hand who had just burned Kmart down. And so, I go, what should I ask him? She goes, \"What's on your mind?\" So, I walk up to him and I'm\nlike, what's on your mind? - The following is a conversation\nwith Andrew Callaghan, host of Channel 5 on YouTube, where he does Gonzo style interviews with fascinating humans\nat the edges of society, the so-called vagrants,\nvagabonds, runaways, outlaws. From QAnon adherence to fish heads to O-Block residents, and much more. He created the documentary that I highly recommend\ncalled \"This Place Rules\" on the undercurrents that led to the January 6th Capitol riots. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast\". To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Andrew Callaghan. - I tried to color-match you though. Got the black and white going. I went to Walmart before this and got the Wrangler shirt with the Texas Longhorns\ntee and everything. - Is that where you shop, Walmart? - Generally, yeah. - I'm a Target man myself. - There's no way you get\nthose suits from Target. - So, you're saying it's a\nnice way to compliment a suit. - I think you go Men's\nWearhouse, if not further. - I think you would be wrong. - [Andrew] You go further. - No, the other direction. - You got that from Target? - Not Target. I was joking about Target. I like Walmart better.\n(Andrew chuckles) It just felt like a funny thing to say. (Andrew laughing) - No, it was funny. - The most expensive\nthing I own is this watch. And it was given to me as a gift. - Yeah. When I was on tour, I had\nthese $2,700 Cartier glasses that I got for a lot of money, $2,700. - Like sunglasses? - Yeah. But they're really embarrassing. - Mm-hmm.\n- But I was on tour, so I just felt like I could do anything as far as fashion choices. - Oh, yeah.\n- But looking back at pictures for myself in that era,\nI'm like, God, what- - So, that was the symbol of\nthe fame got to your head? I think so, yeah. I think\nfame getting to your head. If you spend more than\n100 bucks on sunglasses, you've officially gone off a deep- - You've crossed the line, totally. And that's where you go back\nto Walmart to humble yourself. I really love Walmart. In fact, I moved to Austin,\nbecause I was at Walmart and a lady said that I\nlook handsome in a suit. - [Andrew] Mm. - And I was like, that's\nit. I love this place. She just said it for no reason whatsoever. This older lady just looked at me and with this like genuine sweetness, just said, \"Oh, you look handsome.\" - She's not wrong, man. - Thank you. - That's part of your whole swag though. - Yeah, the suit thing. Yep. Anyway. What was the first, if you remember, first recorded interview you did? - Hmm. Well, like my first grade\nteacher, Mrs. Claudia, this is back in the day,\nlike I was telling you. We just asked her about her life in Columbia\nand stuff like that. But I didn't really get\ninto actual journalism until my ninth grade year. I had no idea I had an interest in it. Before then, I wanted to be a rapper. It's all about hip hop and meditation and picking psilocybin mushrooms in public parks and stuff like that. That's what I was into. - That's a lot. Psilocybin, meditation, rap, public parks. - Yeah. I was making\nlike conscious rap music. I was to the point where I had four dreamcatchers\nhanging above my bed. - Yeah.\n- Alex Grey painting on the wall, tapestry on the ceiling, just scribbling rhymes down all the time. - So, you said somewhere\nthat you sucked at school. - Okay, well, let's\nstep back a little bit. So, I had this amazing\njournalism course in ninth grade. - Yeah.\n- I went to an alternative high school and the teacher was named Calvin Shaw. And he was just like, I ended up taking his class all four years and he used to let me\nactually leave school. I didn't like going to school. So, he let me basically go around Seattle and do different interviews with people as long as I could come\nback by the end of the day and write a story for his class. And he'd mark me as present. So, the first article that I wrote was about the Silk Road in the deep web. (Andrew chuckles) 'Cause you know. - Yeah. Nice.\n- As a ninth grader, when I discovered the Hidden Wiki, I thought that I was really tapping into the most secret society, elite level black market in the world. And so, if you remember, they had that Hidden Wiki link\nthat was like, hire a hitman. And so, I messaged them\nand I was like, all right, I wanna get someone killed at my school. How much is it gonna cost me? - Yeah.\n- And I published my interview with the Hidden Wiki hitman, who was probably a Fed or something, but who knows?\n- Mm-hmm. - And my first article was called like, \"Inside the Deep Web: A\nConversation with a Hitman\". - That's nice.\n- Yeah. - I mean, you were fearless even then. - I was hiding behind a Tor browser, so there's not much fear to be had. - Oh. So, it was anonymous? - It was anonymous, but I\ndid publish it under my name. So, you're right. I could\nhave been in danger. - I also saw that you\ntook too many shrooms when you were young and that led you to have hallucinogen-persisting\nperception disorder, HPPD.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] Can you explain what this is? - Well, that condition is classified by persistent visual snow\nfloaters, morphing objects. I see them right now. I\nsee them all the time. - The snow is in the room. - The snow is definitely in\nthe room. It's all over you. And basically, it wasn't\nthat I took too many shrooms. I think that it was... I took about an eighth\nof cyanescens mushrooms, which are the ones that come from the earth\ninstead of cow shit. And I took an eighth of those\nat my friend Toby's house, which is a normal amount,\nbut I was in eighth grade. So, I woke up the next morning with these extreme visual distortions. And I thought that it would go away. I tried to make it go away, but there's really no cure for HPPD. It's a lifelong condition. So, it's just a matter of dealing with it and realizing that it is only visual. So, when people ask me, \"Hey, I have HPPD, how do I cope with it?\" I say, remember that every\nother sense that you have, what you can hear, what you can taste, your feet on the ground, you're still on earth, you're still here. - Well, you said it's only visual - Mm-hmm.\n- and yes, gratitude for being alive at all. - Yeah.\n- It's great. But you said that this led you into some dark psychological places like depersonalization disorder. - Yeah. Depersonalization is the\nfeeling that you are not real, but that reality still exists. Derealization is the\nidea that reality itself is an illusion created by your mind and that you're the only person alive. And that everything that your brain is projecting to your\nvisual cortex is a lie. And that you're the\nonly living human being. - Both are pretty intense. - HPPD creates both of those things. And so, when I've talked to people who have the condition,\nit's really either/or. But more than 70% of people with HPPD fall into either category. They're both coping mechanisms for the, I don't know what really happens. I talked to a researcher\nonce named Dr. Abraham. He lives in Upstate New York. He's the leading scientist\nwhen it comes to HPPD research. He's the only one who\nactually seems to care about finding a cure.\n- Uh-huh. - And the only known treatment right now is alcohol and benzodiazepines. - That's not good.\n- Right. So, alcoholism, something that came into\nmy life pretty early, alcohol abuse as a result\nof that experience, because that helps with\nthe visual symptoms. Makes some of the static go away. - Man. - [Andrew] Never tried benzos though. - So, can you explain to me\nwhere in that spectrum you are? So, do you sometimes have a sense that you're not real\n- Sometimes. - and something else is not real? Like the reality's not real? - Yeah. I experience it all the time. But like I said, my job helps with that, because I get to feel like I'm, when you seek out extremes\nto a certain extent and you put yourself on the\nfront lines of intense events, whether it be politically or socially, or just dive into deep fringe subcultures, you get this feeling that you're real. And being filmed is also confirmation, if you can look at the MP4 file that you're in fact living here on earth. - Confirming\n- Yeah. - that you are in it with reality by watching\nyourself on video. - [Andrew] Exactly. - So, is that basically the engine behind all the extreme\ninterviews you've done? - Well, I got HPPD around the same time that I began this journalism\ncourse in ninth grade. So, I always used journalism as a therapeutic mechanism to deal with some of these symptoms,\nespecially depersonalization. There's some pretty good illustrations of what it feels like. Kinda feels like you're\ntrapped behind your eyes or that you're just this nebulous soul that's trapped in a flesh suit that you're not really a part of. You're puppeteering a\nflesh and bone skin suit. - Trapped or just the ability\nto step outside of yourself? - You feel like your soul is not something that is\nconnected to your body. It's something living in your head. It's really hard to explain to people who haven't gone through\nderealization or depersonalization, but if you go on support\ngroups, they always say like, \"How do I break free from behind my eyes?\" Like dark stuff like that.\n- Oh, so you're trapped. There's a higher state of being through meditation that you\ncan step outside of yourself, but this is not that.\n- Mm-hmm. Unfortunately, it was the\nkind of meditative path or the eastern path that I took and fused that with\npsychedelic culture in Seattle that took me down the psychedelic use rabbit\nhole in the first place. So, (chuckles) I'd say it all\nstarted with \"Siddhartha\". - \"Siddhartha\". That's a good book. Have you done shrooms since then? - No, I don't really do psychedelic drugs, but a lot of people think\nthat I'm against them, which I'm not, just doesn't work for me. If it works for you, I'm\nsure they can be really fun. Especially, I know there's\nlots of like therapeutic uses for acid and ketamine and psilocybin, but I personally abstain\nfrom those kind of... Anything psychotropic,\nI try to stay away from. - Drinking a bit? - Well, yeah, I didn't drink at all before I had the HPPD stuff and I would've drank later in life, but definitely like 14, 15, every day after school, I'd\ndrink a 40 ounce of Mickey's. It kinda looks like Olde\nEnglish, but the bottle's green and it has a hornet on the side of it. Just became a ritual just to deal with the\nanxiety of that situation. - And it made the snow go away? - Yeah. Alcohol really works\nto suppress HPPD symptoms. - So, you said you\nhated classes in school, except that journalism class. - Okay, we need to clear this up, because on my Wikipedia\npage, for some reason, for Andrew Callaghan early life, it says Andrew hated every single class except for one.\n- Yeah. - So, I've had a bunch of\nteachers who are super cool, like this guy, Tim, my astronomy\nprofessor at ninth grade, - Yep.\n- Mrs. Zanetti, my creative writing\nteacher in sixth grade, and this really cool dude\nat my college in New Orleans named Charles Cannon, who taught me a class called\nNew Orleans Mythology, - Mm-hmm.\n- my three favorite classes besides my journalism class, and they all hit me up and they're like, \"Hey, man, saw you said you hated every class.\n(Lex laughing) - Except the journalism.\n- Sorry I couldn't be everything that you wanted me to be.\"\n- Yeah. - And so, I just wanna say,\nshout out to all those teachers. I didn't hate every class. The point that I was making is that being forced into the\ninstitution of school so young and having to take common\ncore classes like biology, dissecting frogs, history\nof the Han Dynasty, stuff like that that I\ndidn't want to learn, but I had to learn multiple times. I learned about the dynastic\ncycle in ancient China three separate times at\nthree different schools. And I was like, who is writing this curriculum?\n(Lex laughing) And why is it so important\nthat I understand this process? - Yeah. - The part that makes school difficult, especially in college,\nis that you have people just going to school\njust to get the degree who don't really know exactly\nwhat they're interested in. And they don't even have\ntime to figure that out, 'cause they're in a business program or a communications program\nwith no specific interest. - Well, I think if you\nwanna do school right, take on every single subject\nthat you're forced into. It's like the David Foster Wallace, - Mm-hmm.\n- just be unborable by it. - Mm-hmm.\n- Just really go in as if ancient Chinese dynasties are the most interesting thing\nyou could possibly learn. - And it is somewhat interesting, the Silk Road and the Great Wall and terracotta, the soldiers and stuff. But I'm just saying like,\nwhen I got to college, I signed up for journalism school. And I didn't get to take a media class until the second semester. And I had to take everything prior to that and I'd already spent so much time. I just think the excruciating boredom of schooling left a bad taste in my mouth. - Yeah.\n- But there was individual classes that I liked a lot. - Yeah, there should be some choice or maybe a lot of choice even\nat the level of high school for what kind of\n- Mm-hmm. - classes you pursue. - Yeah, for sure. - And you're also saying, so Wikipedia is not\nalways perfectly right? - No, but it's just interesting, because I've said so much in podcasts, but that's what they isolated.\n- Mm-hmm. - And I've gotten that question before, which I understand it's the first thing on my Wikipedia page, but it makes me sound like a super hater. Have you ever seen\n(Lex laughing) this Instagram page\ncalled depthsofwikipedia? - [Lex] Oh, it's great. - Oh, it's so good, dude. - You said you love journalism. What did you love about\njournalism? What hooked you? - On a basic level, everybody\nwants media coverage, right? Everyone likes to be on camera and get exposure for\nwhatever they're doing. And so, being a journalist and being a almost like a\nportal for exposure for people allows you to be on the front row of everything that you\nwant to be a part of. You get to be in the front row for history as it's unfolding, because\neveryone wants to be covered. So, being a journalist gives you a ticket to everywhere that you wanna go in life. And so, it allows you to step into different realities almost and then go back to yours. And it just keeps life interesting. - \"Buy the ticket, take the\nride,\" Hunter S. Thompson. Is he up there as one of the influences? Who are your influences? - I think the early\n\"Daily Show\" was so good. Sacha Baron Cohen, huge influence. That was like... \"Da Ali G Show\" especially. I think Louis Theroux's\nbroadcast on BBC were great. I was really into Hunter S. Thompson too, but not really until college. - Mm-hmm.\n- I really like a particular Hunter S. Thompson book called \"The Great Shark Hunt\", where he covers the Ruben\nSalazar murder by LAPD or LA Sheriff's Department\nin Boyle Heights in the '70s. And his relationship with\nhis lawyer, Oscar Acosta, and that whole saga is great. \"Fear and Loathing\" I like, but not as much as his\nstraightforward reporting. 'Cause there's the Gonzo side of Hunter where he is saying he's\ntaking drugs and seeing shit. And there's the other side of him, which is an actual reporter interested in telling a\nstory that's has news value. So, it's two different lanes for him. - There is something about\nyou that makes people want to say you're the Hunter S. Thompson of this generation.\n- Mm. - And I don't think they mean the drugs. I think they mean some kind\nof non-standard willingness to explore the extremes of humanity - [Andrew] Mm. - and like almost a celebration\nof the extremes of humanity. - Yeah. Well, that's a\nvery kind comparison. I'll get there one day maybe. I just went to Aspen on a little Hunter S. Thompson recon trip to go check out the Woody Creek Tavern, which is the spot that he, it was like his bar near his cabin. And it was pretty cool to see. Unfortunately, it's turned\ninto not a dive bar now, but it's a sit-down country restaurant. But it was cool. But I expected to see a bunch of gnarly Hunter S. Thompson types doing speed.\n(Andrew drowns out Lex) - Doing s... (Andrew and Lex laughing) It's doing drugs. Drugs and alcohol is\nall part of it somehow. - [Andrew] Yeah. - So, It opens a gateway to a deeper understanding of humanity. - But I will say though, as someone now who doesn't party like I\ndid when I was younger, it's not as important as I\nthought it was, you know? - Yeah. I'm conflicted on this. I'm good friends with a lot of people that say alcohol is really bad for you. - [Andrew] Mm. - And I believe that too. But there's something\nthat, as an introvert, as a person who has a lot of anxiety, for me, alcohol has opened doors of just opening myself\nup to the world more. - Oh, I'm actually a fan of\nalcohol, moderate drinking. But I'm saying like, my life before, I would\nsay 2019, 2018 especially, there was the chaos on camera, but then there was my private life, which was chaotic partying all the time. - [Lex] Oh, I see. - And I convinced myself\nmuch like Hunter did that that was\n- Sure. - the secret sauce that in the core, in my spiritual core\n- Yeah. - that gave me the creativity. But then, I cut out a lot of that stuff and I'm just as creative. And it's interesting that a lot of, I think one of the hardest\nparts about addiction is that if you're a functioning, highly creative addict of any kind, your brain and the\naddictive part of your brain convinces yourself that it's\nall part of the cross purpose. And that it has this symbiotic, inspirational thing going on. But it's not true. It can be, but it's typically not. - Yeah, it's not a requirement. - [Andrew] Right. - You can sometimes channel, you can sometimes\nleverage all those things for your creativity, but the creative engine\nlives outside of that. - [Andrew] Like have you\nread Hunter's daily routine in the year up to his death?\n(Lex chuckles) It was like 15 grapefruits,\nan 8-ball of coke and just a certain\namount of shotgun shells for him to fire into the sky - Yeah, yeah.\n- every morning. There's no way, and he didn't do anything\ncreative in those final years. - [Lex] Yeah. - So, the creativity goes away and gradually you just\nbecome like a party animal. Like Andy Dick. - A caricature of yourself.\n- Yeah. - That's why life is interesting. You make all kinds of choices and sometimes you can\ncreate works of genius in a short amount of time\nbased on drugs and no drugs. Einstein had that miracle year where he published\nseveral incredible papers in one year, 1905. - Did he do drugs before that? - Lots of coke and... (Andrew laughing) - I was like, I believed you for a second.\n(Lex laughing) But I'm like, did Einstein have blow? I don't think he did. - How do you think he gets that hair? Come on.\n- It's true. - I'm just asking questions. - High confidence hair. - Look into it. Yeah.\n- You know what I mean? - Yeah. Well, no, he's a well put\ntogether, sexy young man. The hair came later.\n- Yeah. Was Albert Einstein\nattractive as a teenager? Not teenager, was he\nattractive as a young man. - Sexually attractive, or-\n(Andrew laughing) - I don't, you know-\n- I'm turned on by Einstein at all ages,\nI don't discriminate. - But are you more turned on by the work that he did\nor his physical being? - No, sometimes I fantasize what it would be like to be (coughs) in the arms of Einstein. I couldn't even get that out.\n- Yeah. In the arms of Einstein.\n(Lex laughing) - Yeah. Just, I wanna feel safe. - It's a good idea for a rom-com. (Lex laughing) - To be a little more serious, general relativity, that\nspacetime can be unified and curved by gravity is an incredibly wild and\ndifficult idea to come up with. It's a really, really\ndifficult thing to imagine, given how well Newtonian\nclassical mechanics physics works for predicting how stuff happens on earth, to think (sharply inhales) (Lex blows) like that (chuckles) gravity can morph spacetime,\n- Mm-hmm. - both space and time, and it permeates the entire universe, it's a field,\n- Mm-hmm. - it's a really wild idea to come up. As one human on earth to intuit that is really, really, really difficult. And it's really sad to me that he didn't get a Nobel Prize for that. - Was there people saying he\nwas crazy when he was around? Or was it-\n- Well, he... - Was he universally\nrecognized as an OG of this? - No, I think once the papers came out, he was widely recognized as a true genius. But before that, he wasn't recognized. He had a really difficult life.\n- So, backing up, where does a black hole go? Like after something gets sucked into it? - You mean, is it a portal to another place that kind of thing? - [Andrew] Yeah. - No. Well, we don't know. It could be that the universe is kinda like Swiss cheese\nfull of black holes. There's something called\nhawking radiation where the, because of quantum mechanics, the information leaks out of a black hole. So, it is possible to escape a black hole. There's a lot of\ninteresting questions there. - I hope we get to the bottom of that. - And there's a super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, which doesn't seem to scare\nphysicists, but it terrifies me. - Oh yeah, for sure.\nAstronomy can be terrifying. - Yeah, we're all like orbiting. We're not just orbiting the sun, but the sun is part of the solar system, is part of the galaxy and it's all orbiting\na gigantic black hole. - Have you ever spoke to someone\nwho's been to outer space? - Jeff Bezos. He flew his own rocket. - [Andrew] Wow.\n(Lex chuckles) That's pretty cool.\n- But astronaut that's been to deep space, no. - Mm. - Well, maybe I've spoken to an alien that just hasn't admitted it. - I wanna do a research paper or like a report about space madness. It's supposed to be this\ntorturous feeling that you get when you look away from\nearth and into the abyss after you've exited\nEarth's orbit or whatever. Because there's one specific psychiatrist who knows how to deal with space madness. And I wanna figure out how\nand interview people with it. - Is this a real thing? - Yes.\n- Like is there Wikipedia article on it?\n- Yes, look up space madness treatment. - Well, now, I don't trust Wikipedia after what you told me, so. - I know. They think I hate classes. - I thought you meant more about the fact that you're isolated out in space, that we need social\nconnection and it's difficult. - Yeah, I think it's just a feeling of\nextreme insignificance that you might get sometimes\nwhen you look at the night sky. But it's that times a thousand. It's like an existential void that's created after\nlooking into the abyss, and then realizing how small\nearth is in the grand scheme. You just start to really\nhave a strange new perception about the pointlessness of existence. - I don't need to go to space for that. - Only a handful of\npeople have been to space, but I'm sure they're all pretty well-off. So, the psychiatrist has\nto be in the multimillions. - Well, technically, we're all in space, 'cause earth is in space, but so, I wonder if\nyou have to go to space to talk to the psychiatrist. (Andrew chuckles) - Yeah. Probably so. - Well, technically, we're all in space, so he can't,\n- Right. - that's a boundary he can't have- - But not everyone believes that, as you've seen from my work probably. - You're right. And those are important people that are asking important questions. - Yeah. - You hitchhiked across US\nfor 70 days when you were 19. - Right.\n- Tell the story of that. - Well, this connects to\nwhat I was talking about with the boredom of school\nand these common core classes. So, after my first year of school where I lived in the dorms like a old school dormitory building at a school in New Orleans\ncalled Loyola University, I wanted to just do something. I felt so bored. I was working for the school newspaper for that whole first year. It was called \"The Maroon\". And I didn't have the ability\nto write my own stories. I had to defer to an older editor and they would give me\nstories to write about. And they were all about\nlike on campus happenings, like the Pope visits New Orleans or glass recycling to be\nrestored in the French Quarter or hoverboards banned on\ncampus due to safety concerns. And it just felt like,\n(Lex chuckles) all right, well, I wanted\nto be a Gonzo reporter. I'm not sure if working my way up through the traditional newsroom hierarchy is gonna get me to that point. So, I started reading a\nbunch of old hobo literature, like post-World War II vagabonding stuff. And there was this book\n- Yeah. - called \"Vagabonding in America\" by an old hobo Ed Buryn. And I read this and it just basically, obviously some of it was outdated. They had stuff in there\nlike the hobo code, like, oh, this moniker on the side of a fence means this person has free soup or something like that. They didn't have stuff like that. But what it did tell me-\n(Lex chuckles) - [Lex] That's great. - It told me about train\nstop towns like Dunsmuir and places in Montana where there was a friendly\nattitude toward drifters. And that still persists from\nthe '60s and '70s to this day. Even though in my opinion, movies like \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" have ruined hitchhiking\nculture in America, because now, everyone thinks you're gonna decapitate\nthem if they pick you up. So, after my final day\nof courses at Loyola, I literally left all of my\nbelongings inside my dorm and took the streetcar\nto the Greyhound station, got a one-way ticket to Baton Rouge. And I was like, I'm gonna hitchhike across the whole country back\nto Seattle with no money. And that was the plan. And it worked out. - I love it.\n- Yeah. - I traveled across the\nUnited States before in similar kind of plan. 'Cause you we-\n- Were you on the silver dog? - Sil... (Lex laughing) - The Greyhound bus. - Greyhound is pretty nice. - That's a step above hitchhiking. - Yeah, that's way\nbetter than hitchhiking. 'Cause I don't wanna-\n- Hitchhiking, Greyhound, Amtrak, airline.\n- Yeah. Amtrak, no. That's elitist. - What's in between Greyhound and Amtrak?\n(Lex laughing) A car. That's what it is. - Yeah, it's a car. Yeah. A shitty car.\n- It's a car. (Andrew laughing) - Okay, cool. - Yeah, I lived in a shitty car. - You lived in a car? - Yeah, when I was - Oh, nice.\n- driving across from the United States. Yeah.\n- Solo? - With a friend, some solo. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - And I would eat cold soup. - Mm. I love cold soup.\n- Yeah. - What I like is the\ncold chickpeas in a can. Get the water out and just dump 'em into your mouth.\n- Yeah, yeah. - Those are good, beef jerky, KIND bars. KIND bars are really good for the road. - Yeah, all of that is great, but too much of it is not great. Like too much cold soup, - Hmm.\n- not great. Too much beef jerky. - So, what was the route you took? Was it Chicago across or\nwas it Philadelphia across? - Philadelphia across. - [Andrew] To LA or where? - San Diego's and went up,\nbut it was a zigzagging. Went up to Chicago, and then\nall the way down to Texas. - So, you went Philly through\nAppalachia up to the Midwest. - Yep.\n- Did you cut over like through the southwest\ndown to San Diego? - No, no, no. It went\nstraight down to Texas. All the way down to the Midwest.\n- Okay. - So, like. (sharply inhales) - But did you cut from Texas west through New Mexico and Arizona to get to San Diego?\n- Yeah. - That is the best road trip place. - Mm-hmm.\n- Interstate 40. Like Albuquerque, Flagstaff, Vegas, Kingman, the Mojave Desert,\nYuma, doesn't get better. - Yeah, and you're\nkids, so you don't care. And you are throwing caution to the wind. And I met some crazy, crazy people. - It gives me some sanity whenever I'm feeling out\nof control or bummed out. I just remembered that the\nroad is still out there. The open road\n- Yeah. - never goes anywhere. And it's like a, I see an invisible door in the corner of the room all the time. That makes me more\ncomfortable, 'cause I'm like, hey, at the end of the\nday, if I'm bummed out, I can go hit the road and I'm sure there's\ngonna be a fun time ahead. - Yeah. Get that Greyhound ticket and go. - I would say silver dog half, because sometimes I gotta ride the dog when no one will pick me up. There's some places in the country where no one's gonna pick you up. - Yeah.\n- Kansas, Missouri, they're not gonna do it.\n- Maybe you're not charming enough. You thought about that?\n- I was 19. Fresh, clean shaven. - Yeah.\n- I was pretty charming, I'd say.\n- All right. - But the older you get, the\nharder it is to hitchhike, because they think\nyou're an escaped convict or some type of psycho wanderer. And some of these people are\nlike, what we call punishers. It's people who never stop talking. And so, they see someone hitchhiking and they're like, yes, I'm\ngonna talk at this person. - Yeah.\n- And you can tell that their eyes are wide. They're like, what's up?\nAnd you're like, oh shit. So, it's six hours of\njust like, oh, cool, nice. Yeah.\n- That's rough. - Yeah, yeah.\n- You're right. You're right. I like people that are\ncomfortable in silence. - Yeah. But then that also raises the question, are they about to kill me? You know what I mean? - I think that's a you problem, not a... (Andrew and Lex laughing) - You know what's funny\nis almost everybody who picked me up when I was hitchhiking was like a day laborer.\n- Yeah. - It was almost all Mexican\nday laborers who picked me up. - Oh, interesting. - Because I think that in\nsome places down there, that's a typical thing\nto do, hitchhike to work. A lot of people don't have cars, but they still have to get to their jobs. So, a lot of people ask me, \"Hey, where should I drop you off? Where's your job at?\" And I'm like, my job is to explore. And they were down with it. - See, for me, it was really easy, because you just say like, I'm traveling across the United States. - Mm. - And I think people love that idea. - Yeah.\n- And they want to help. - Mm-hmm. - I think they romantic... Because they also have\nthat invisible door. - Mm-hmm.\n- Everybody has that invisible door. I just want to go. - So you know what I'm talking about. - [Lex] Yeah, I don't think- - It can anchor you a bit, just to remind you that every pattern that I've fallen into is voluntary and it's for my own\nstability and mental health. - Well, that's why I'm renting everything and I'm making sure\n- Yeah. - tomorrow I can just go. I gave away everything\nI own twice in my life. Just very like,\n- Mm-hmm. - I'm ready to go tonight. Let's go. - What's the hardest item you've had to part with\nin this experience? - There's nothing. - You've never had a material object that was really hard to let go of? - No. - So, you'd give that watch to somebody if it meant an object?\n- No, this, you're right. (palm taps) You're right. That's probably the only... I've never had to let go of that though. - Yeah.\n- But that's the only thing I own. This means a lot to me.\nBut everything else. But then, again, listen, because okay, this watch\nis given to me by Rogan, who's become a close friend. But whenever I romanticize the notion that this watch means\na lot to me, he's like, \"Don't worry about it, I'll just get you the same one again.\" - [Andrew] Yeah. (Andrew and Lex laughing) It's like goddamnit. So-\n- It's a pretty sick-ass gift though. - Yeah. It's pretty sick. I'm not usually a gift guy, but when when somebody you look up to gives you a thing, it's\na nice little symbol - Yeah.\n- of that relationship. So, it's nice. But other than that, no. But even this, like whatever. The relationship is what matters. The human is what matters, not the- - [Andrew] I agree a hundred percent. - You had something like this? - Not really. There was a hard drive that I lost that had all of my\nchildhood pictures on it and stuff like that, that\nI think about all the time. 'Cause I left it on a train. And the certain memories, you think about it, you\njust get pissed off. I just think to myself,\nsomeone has that somewhere. I have dreams\n- Mm-hmm. - about reuniting with the hard drive. - You and Hunter Biden have the similar kind of dream.\n(Andrew laughing) - I don't think he wants\nto reunite with that one. - [Lex] Okay. - Dude, it's crazy. All he did was smoke crack, right? - Yeah.\n- Or was there more stuff going on? - I think there's prostitutes involved. - Oh, okay. Whatever. - I think you gotta look into it. - I think I have to look into it too.\n(Lex laughing) - I dunno. Yeah.\n(Andrew laughing) Was Kerouac, Jack Kerouac and somebody that was\nan inspiration at all in this road trip?\n- Nope. - Did you even know who that is? The Beat Generation and all this?\n- I didn't know who it was. And then, after I did the... Ultimately, I wrote a book about my hitchhiking\nexperience years later. And everyone was like, have\nyou read \"On the Road\"? And then, \"On the Road\", I probably heard the title of that book every day at\nleast 10 times for two years. And I'm sure Kerouac is a great guy. (Lex laughing) I just don't, I'm not too familiar\nwith the Beat Generation. - It's a great book. It's a... You read it or no? - I refuse to read it. People even have gifted it to me, have been like, \"Hey, man,\nyou're gonna love this one.\" And I'm like,\n- Yeah. - is that \"On the Road\"? Honestly, people have given me a book with wrapping paper on it\n(Lex laughing) and they're like, \"This\nis right up your alley.\" I was like, that's fucking\n\"On the Road\", isn't it? (Lex laughing) - Give you a different cover. - Yeah, no, I'm like, anything but that. But I'm sure it's a great book. It's just the comparison\nthing drives me crazy. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - But respect, big respect to Kerouac, would never speak down on that whole, anyone in the Beat Generation. - What are some interesting moments you remember from that, those 70 days? - Man, there was so much. Getting mistaken for a\ngay prostitute on my first hitchhiking ride\n- I can see that. - in Louisiana was pretty funny. - Where did you come from\nand where did you go? - Well, the journey began in Baton Rouge. And the first destination was Houston, which is about four and a half\nhours west on Interstate 10. So, I'm in Crowley, Louisiana. I'm on the side of the road and I guess this was\na cruising truck stop. It was known for being a place where male lot lizards\nwould go to procure clients. And I was there. - Lot lizards are- - It's a derogatory\nterm in trucker culture for a prostitute who hangs out at the Loves or Pilot Flying J. - Mm.\n- Large interstate truck stops. Now, trucker culture as it once was, is pretty much finished, because of the live stream cameras they have inside of the trucks now. So, you can't snort\nSudafed or pick up anybody. Can't even pick up a\nhitchhiker or you'll get fired. - Killed all the romance. - Yeah, definitely. The old school outlaw trucker lifestyle, unless you're an owner operator\nwho's not even in a union, which is like a real\ncowboy way to haul loads. You can't do that. - You were mistaken for a lot lizard. - Mistaken for a lot lizard\nby a small man from Honduras with a spiky leather\njacket covered in studs. - [Lex] Nice. - Didn't speak any English, but I thought he was just a nice guy. And then, he pulled over at a... There's private theaters in the south where they have\nconfessional booths set up and they have three channels and people go in there and you know. - Porn?\n- Yeah. - Mm-hmm.\n- People go in there and please themselves.\n- Masturbate. Yeah, uh-huh.\n- Yeah, yeah. So, he thought he was\ntaking me to one of those. And I was like, all\nright, cool, man. Yeah. If this guy wants to go jerk off, I'm just gonna wait in the car. It's all good. I don't discriminate. But then I was like,\nhe buys a booth for me. And I'm like, okay.\n- That's nice. - I'm not really in the mood to watch porn with this random guy. So, he gets in the same booth as me and he starts jerking\noff right next to me. And I'm like, oh, man. (Lex laughing) I don't think this is chill. I'm like, dude, can you stop? (Lex laughing) Can you stop jacking off? And he's like, \"What do you mean? I thought this is what you wanna do. I have money for you. Like, what's up?\"\n- Yeah. And I was like, oh, no,\nI'm just a regular guy. He was super cool about\nit. He started laughing. He was like, \"Oh, my bad, man. I thought you were selling something.\" I said no. And he said,\n\"Oh, it's all good.\"' And he gave me a ride\nall the way to Houston. - That's great.\n- Yeah. We talked about anything except that for the rest of the car ride. - That's great that he\njust rolled with it. Oh, sorry about that.\n- Yeah. It could have been... I had about a foot and a half on this guy,\n- Honest mistake. - so I wasn't too scared. I also had a knife in my pocket, but I didn't wanna stab him, especially not at a place like that. - And you were still, that didn't leave a bad\ntaste in your mouth? - Well, I figured that can't happen again. It can't keep happening, because I was like,\n(Lex laughing) all right, if I got this out of the way the first ride,\n- Yeah. - the following rides\nare gonna be spectacular. - Yeah, I mean, who among us have not been\nmistaken for a lot lizard? - It's a fact. You heard it here first. (Lex chuckles) - What else? What's some interesting,\nbeautiful people that you've met along the way.\n- Well, I used the app Couchsurfing to find places to stay.\n- Nice. I remember Couchsurfing. - Now, you can only submit like five Couchsurfing requests a day, unless you're a premium\nmember, which means you also host people.\n- Wait, Couchsurfing's still around?\n- Yeah, yeah, totally. - [Lex] Oh nice. - But it's evolved obviously\ninto a different thing. - Airbnb is the competitor to that, right? - Couchsurfing is free though. - [Lex] Right. - So, Couchsurfing, they call\nit like the CS community. So, basically, there'd be\nthese Couchsurfing superhosts in different cities. There was one in Santa\nFe, this firefighter dude who had 15 other\ncouchsurfers there chilling. - [Lex] Nice. - So, I would do it everywhere. A lot of them were Catholics, - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - so it was their way of giving back. A lot of them were nudists. And so, I didn't realize that there's a small little section at the bottom of someone's\nCouchsurfing profile that says clothing optional. - Yes.\n- And that means if you go there, I thought it meant like it's cool if you walk to the\nbathroom in your underwear. No. If you go there,\neveryone's gonna be butt naked. - Mm-hmm.\n- So, I made that mistake a few times. Not that I'm anti-nudist,\nbut I didn't want to, I wasn't ready to take that leap of faith. And yeah, it was just great. Couchsurfing hosts were amazing. - [Lex] Yeah. - But that was just great. It was this constant thing where I felt like, wow,\npeople were so welcoming. I'm not having to pay them a\ndollar for this experience. - Yeah, I love Couchsurfing. - Yeah.\n- For like, again, for me being an introvert, just crashing on a person's couch, being essentially forced into\na great conversation is great. - Yeah. The one thing that gets exhausting about hitchhiking is\nconstantly thanking people. Being in constant superficial gratitude everywhere all the time. Like, oh, thanks for letting\nme sleep on your couch. Thanks for the food. - [Lex] Yeah. - Part of the reason I wanted to live in an RV later in life is to avoid having to constantly live in this thanks so much type of frequency, 'cause it's exhausting to\nconstantly, hey, man, thanks. - I think the shallowness\nof that interaction is exhausting.\n- Yeah. - Not just the, not the thanks.\n- Yeah. - It was a true favor, of course. I love giving people gratitude for that. But just this thing where\neveryone who picks you up is, you get eight rides a day, you're like thanking eight people a day. Like they're the second coming of Jesus. You start to feel a little bit debased. - What'd you learn about\npeople from that journey? That's your first time\nreally going into it. - That the American public\nis just so kind overall. They're so embracing\ndepending on who you are. And specifically though,\nthe Christian family people of the US who drive in minivans and have that fish sticker\non the back where it's like, Jesus fish,\n- Mm-hmm. - and then they have the family sticker, where each member of the\nfamily is a stick figure. Those people never picked me up and would flip me off\nwith their whole family. Sometimes they would throw\nfull Dr. Peppers at me as a family while I stood\non the side of the road- - As a family together. - They'd yell shit like,\n\"Go to hell, hippie,\" when I was on the side of the road. And so, it's weird that\nthe most charitable Christian American family values people never gave me any charity\nor even conversation. They were antagonizing me and saw me as like a hippie\nleftover from the '60s who needed to go to work go to Vietnam. I don't get it.\n- Yeah. Yeah.\n- But the people who really extended a hand to\nme is people on the margins. - Yeah.\n- People working on seasonal visas. People whose cars have less\nthan a quarter tank left. People struggling with\naddiction who saw me struggling, or at least they thought that I was, 'cause they assumed I was hitchhiking not out of adventure,\nbut 'cause I had no car. And were willing to sacrifice\ntheir day almost sometimes to take me exactly where I needed to go. - That's beautiful, man. I've had similar kind of experience that people who are struggling\nthe most are the ones who are willing to help\nyou when you're struggling. - Yeah. - There's people like in religious context and other kind of communities\nthat just judge others, - Right.\n- because they've constructed a value system where they're better than others, because of that value system.\n- Mm-hmm. - And that actually has a cascade that forces you to actually be a dick to other humans.\n- Yeah, I never thought about that way. That's so true. Do you think about morality\nand religion a lot? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been to certain parts of the world where religion is really\na big part of life. - [Andrew] Hmm. - I'm just always skeptical about tribes of people that believe a thing and they believe they're\nbetter than others, because they believe that thing. That could be nations,\nthat could be religions. - [Andrew] Yeah. - In Ukraine and in Russia, I've seen a lot of hate towards the other. - [Andrew] Yeah. - And that hate, I'm\nalways very skeptical of, 'cause it could be used by powerful people to direct that hate, just so the powerful people can maintain power and get\nmoney, this kind of stuff. - It's a scary thing to see how easy it is for high-up political\npeople to mobilize the hate of just the average working person and can almost convince them to sabotage their own countrymen, who they share more in common with than the politician they look up to just to advance the agenda of one party. That's what we're seeing now. - Are there some places in America that are better than others? Can you speak negatively of like aforementioned Joe Rogan talk shit about Connecticut nonstop? Can you pick a region in the United States\nyou can talk shit about? - To talk shit about? Oh, for sure. (Lex chuckles) - Or from that experience. Let's just narrow it down to that. - Oh, Colorado.\n(Lex laughing) Oh, Jesus.\n- Really? - Yes.\n- I know so many people that love Colorado.\n- Dude, Dallas, Denver. I used to think Phoenix\nsucks, but I love Phoenix now. The way they build these cities to just be so circular and massive. It's just like, stop. - You don't like circles? - I like grids, man. - Oh, you're a grid guy. - Manhattan, New Orleans, San Francisco. - What is it about grids that\nbring out the worst in people? (Andrew laughing) Circles is where everyone\njust, there's a... - Everyone's just vibing out, loosey-goosey,\n- Yeah. - but the grid gets people locked in and hateful.\n- Yeah. - I don't know, man, but-\n(Lex laughing) - I've never heard anyone talk shit about Colorado, I have to say. It's kinda refreshing. - Yeah.\n- Because it provides a necessary balance for the\nColorado Wikipedia page. - Yeah. Oh, Oregon too. I got problems with Oregon. - Oregon.\n- Yeah. - Well, here's the issue. You have...\n- Mm-hmm. - And I don't like just\ncalling people racist, 'cause it's like a two-dimensional insult, but you have the most racist state with the most psychotic anarchist\ncity in the middle of it. What is going on up there?\nHow did this happen? The yin and the yang is so extreme that there must be\nsomething in the Willamina. - What do you have against anarchism? - I have nothing. I\nused to be an anarchist. When I was in eighth grade,\nI had this friend named Mads, who was part of a group\ncalled Seattle Solidarity, which is like an Antifa precursor. So, I grew up going to\nBlack Bloc protests. And there was a particular shooting, the murder of John Williams, who's a native American wood\ncarver in downtown Seattle. He got killed by a Seattle\npolice officer named Ian Birk. John Williams was carving a pipe from a woodblock with a pocket knife. He's deaf in one ear. Officer pulls a gun on him\nand says, \"Put it down.\" He doesn't hear him. He\nshoots him six seconds later. So, that police-involved shooting is what instantly turned\nme into a very critical of law enforcement kind of\nperson when I was super young. And so, as someone who\nused to see this guy who got murdered, he\nwas a 55-year-old man. I used to see him around Pike\nPlace where my mom lived. It's a public market in downtown. That to me, put me into the\nanarchist political sphere. Just channeling the\nanger of that experience. And the officer got no\ncharges, by the way. You can look up the video. It's horrific. And it didn't get reported. The officer, I'm pretty\nsure, is still active duty. And so, it's like situations\nlike that early in life channeled me toward political extremism. But I grew up to realize how incompatible that anarchistic worldview is with reality and with American society. It can only exist in a\nsmall little chamber. You can't apply that to the industrial\nheartland of the country. - And I think also anarchism. So, we've gotten to know Michael Malice, who's written quite a bit about anarchism. And it's also exists\nas a body of literature about different philosophical notions that resist the state,\n- Mm-hmm. - the ever-expanding state\nin different kinds of ways. And it's always nice to have\nextreme thought experiments to understand\n- Mm-hmm. - what kind of society we want to build. But implementing it may not\nnecessarily be a good idea. - Yeah, Emma Goldman, I'm\na huge fan of her writing. Also the prison abolitionists that are associated with\nthe anarchist movement, Angela Davis, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, all that stuff influential, I still adhere to a lot of those principles\nwhen talking about stuff like radical prison reform\nand stuff like that. But just, I drifted more toward having a more open mind as I got older. - Extremism implemented in almost all of its forms is probably going to\ncause a lot of suffering. - Yeah. - You worked as a doorman on the, I could say legendary Bourbon\nStreet in New Orleans. - [Andrew] That's right. (Lex chuckles) - Where you saw what you described as, this might be another\nWikipedia quote by the way, - But this-\n- This is where I do my research is Wikipedia.\n- Does it say hellish scenes? - [Lex] Hellish scenes in quotes. - Wikipedia is damn right about that one. - All right, thank you. (Andrew laughing) (Lex laughing) That's a win. That's\none in the win column. So, yeah, tell the story of that. What's it like to work on Bourbon Street? What kind of stuff did you see? - I was a host at a fine dining restaurant on the corner of Bourbon in Iberville. So, that's the first street if you go from Canal\nStreet onto the corridor, so this is like across\nfrom a daiquiri spot. It's the middle of the tourist\ncorridor of New Orleans. And the spot was like, and\nkind of a tourist trap. It was called Bourbon\nHouse. The food was good. Chef Eric, I don't want you to see this and think you don't make\ngood andouille sausages, but it was overpriced. And so, we had to maintain\nthis fine dining facade on a street where almost everyone is throwing up, fighting,\nor is half naked. So, there was this policy. We had these giant glass\nwindows next to the tables. So, if you're eating at Bourbon House, you can look out onto Bourbon Street and you can see as you're dining, a full panoramic view of all\nthese partiers, throwing beads, - Yeah.\n- boobs, all that. - [Andrew] Yeah. - We had this policy where\nif we're serving someone, we can't look onto Bourbon Street if something crazy is happening. So, there's a fight\n(Lex laughing) or something like that, we can't look. So, there is a dude, I remember I'm fucking serving a table. There's a dude in a Batman mask, butt naked with 12 pairs\nof beads just jerking it. - Yeah.\n- Back to jerking it. - Full on.\n- He's jerking it. And every single person\n(Lex chuckles) at the restaurant's\nlooking out there like, look, they're taking pictures. And the manager, Steven,\nlooks at me, he's like, \"Keep your fucking eyes\non the table.\" (laughs) So, I'm serving these people and I'm like, would you like\n(Lex laughing) red beans and rice? Or would you like some\nCreole fucking da, da, da. And there's just this dude. And ultimately, the manager went out and escorted him further\ndown Bourbon Street. But I would get off work at\naround midnight every night. And that was when Bourbon\nStreet is at its most chaotic. And so, I lived in the\nFrench Quarter as well, - Oh, wow.\n- so I lived about 12 blocks down Bourbon in a small Creole cottage in a cute little orange old school\nnew Orleans one story spot. I lived in the attic, above these gay meth dealers\nnamed Frankie and Johnny. - [Lex] Oh wow. - And so, (chuckles) I would get off work and I would basically have to walk through\nlike this battlefield. It was a battlefield. Getting home was out of\nlike \"The Warriors\" movie. It was-\n- The best of humanity on display.\n- Yeah. It was like Kensington,\nPhiladelphia, but just alcohol. You know what I mean? - Oh, it's all alcohol.\nBut it's a lot of... Wait, a lot of visitors,\nright, from outside? - Almost all visitors.\n- Yeah. - And that would set the\nflow for the weekend. For example, if the Raiders\nwere playing the Saints, Raider Nation, and they\ndo not play around. If it's the Patriots, that's\na whole different crowd. They think they're better than everybody else.\n- Yeah. Well, they technically are\nbetter than everybody else, but yeah.\n- But people from Massachusetts aren't\nlike the cream of the crop in terms of American superiority. - Strong words. Yeah. - No offense, but I mean. - No, I'm sure they won't take that as offense. (laughs) - They are good at fighting\nthough, I'll tell you that. - [Lex] All right. Great. - New England has hands\n- Right. - compared to some places. - Which places are those? Colorado. - Colorado has no hands. - [Lex] Yeah. (Andrew and Lex laughing) - The West Coast, not too much hands. - That's why you feel safe\ntalking shit about Colorado. - But if you get to the\ncorn-fed parts of East Colorado, - Yeah.\n- these guys got hands bigger than my head. They'll beat the shit\n- Yeah. - out of me, but anyways. I'd walk back to my\nhouse on Bourbon Street, and I would be sifting\nthrough this battlefield. And I had a friend at\nthe time who was like, \"Yo, we should do a taxi\ncab confessions type spinoff where we ask people to\nconfess a deep, dark secret.\" And we posted the next day. And so, we tried that and it went viral on Instagram instantly. It was mostly incest stories,\npeople admitting to incest. I know it's a common southern stereotype, but there's some truth to it. There was some murder confessions. That was pretty crazy. We never really posted any of those, but. - How'd you get people to confess? - Pretty easy. And New Orleans has a homicide\nsolve rate of like 22%. So, most of the time,\nthey'll just tell you. I remember I was walking down Bourbon and I asked this kid, I was like, what's your deepest, darkest secret? And he told me, he's like, \"I just smoked a dude in the Magnolia.\" It's a project house in the Third Ward, project development. And they said, \"I just smoked a dude in\nthe Magnolia playground for touching my sister,\"\nmolesting his sister. And I was like, what? And he was like, \"Yeah, look it up.\" And I was like, all right, hold on. And it was like, man found dead\nin Central City playground. Appeared to be homeless,\nshot execution style. So, I told the kid, I was\nlike, why'd you tell me that? He's like, \"Man, put that shit out there. I'm trying to go viral. Tag me too.\" - Oh wow.\n- Like, dude, I don't think you understand\nthat even if you're a juvenile, he was probably 15,\n- Yeah. - you can get juvenile life in Louisiana for a homicide, even if it's justified. So, I just deleted the\nfootage in front of him. I was like, I'm gonna delete this footage. See that trash button? I'm hitting it right now.\n(Lex chuckles) Don't tell anyone that again. And he was like,\n(Lex laughing) \"All right, I appreciate it.\" And he walked off. But it's the little moments like that that I always remember.\n(Lex sighs) - Anything for the gram, I guess. - Yeah. After a while though, it\nbecame sort of a repetitive, 'cause there's only so many things that people can confess to\nthat go viral, and just... - Oh, so you were trying to see like what- - Well, there's the incest one. Some people just say like, \"I eat ass.\" That was like everyone said that. Or like, \"I cheated on someone,\" or. - I've seen a surprising number of people on your channel\nsay mention eating ass. - Yeah. (Andrew laughing) How seriously you said that. - Yeah.\n- will live in my head for the rest of my life.\n(Lex laughing) - That's good.\n- Yeah. I have- - I want to live in your head - Mm.\n- saying that a lot of people mention eating ass. - Yeah. A lot of people do mention that. - Yeah.\n- Also, that's where I developed this magnetism\nfor freestyle rapping. Everywhere I go, people rap. Not sure why. As a former rapper myself in middle school and for the first year of high school, I think that maybe it\ntakes one to know one. But everywhere I go, people start rapping. If you and me went outside\nof this podcast studio and walked around for five minutes, I could find somebody.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] That's rapping. - I can tell who raps or who can rap, who has eight bars in their\nhead that they're ready to go. - I think you're also,\nthere's something about you that gives them, creates the safe space - Yeah.\n- to perform their art. - Yeah. The \"Quarter Confession\" series was the first time you saw the suit. - [Lex] That's when the suit came out. - [Andrew] Yeah, it was\nkinda like a Ron Burgundy, Eric Andre inspired type- - [Lex] Where'd you get that suit? - [Andrew] Goodwill. - Goodwill.\n- Yeah. Always. (Lex breathes out) - Wow. I was playing checkers, you\nwere playing chess. Good job. - Goodwill has a surprising amount of identical gray suits for sale. - Yeah, I've actually gotten suits at thrift stores before. They're great.\n- Yeah. A lot of people donate suits and I was going for oversized suits, which are the cheapest ones there, so. - [Lex] Yeah. - It was like 12 bucks, 12 to $25 every time for the outfit. - If I wanted to look super sophisticated, like I'm from another era, - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - I would go to thrift store. - [Andrew] Yeah. - 'Cause they're usually like this, there's like a, like\nthe patterns they have, it's just like a more sophisticated suit, which is what you picked out. It made you look ridiculous, but in the best kind of way. - The tough part about\n\"Quarter Confessions\" for me is that everybody that was\nfeatured, for the most part, would more or less regret\nbeing a part of the show. - [Lex] Yeah. - And that over time, just gave me a bad feeling\nwhere I was like, you know what? I feel like I am doing\nan ambush interview, especially 'cause I'm\npresenting as so agreeable. Yet the intention is to\nmake something funny. - Yeah.\n- And I get that that's what people do\nin the satire sphere. I'm sure Ali G and Bruno and\nBorat did the same thing. And I don't think it's unethical, 'cause that's all for\nthe purposes of comedy. It is what it is. But for me, I wanted to\ndo something different. - Yeah. Because there's an\nintimacy to confessing a thing. - [Andrew] Right. - And then, you just don't really realize the implications of that. - And the atmosphere of Bourbon Street is like anything goes.\n- Yeah. - It's a free-spirited place, but if you transport that energy digitally to a different place like Colorado, - [Lex] Yeah. - They might look at it and be like... - Different place in time,\nlike five years later. - [Andrew] Right. - That same person has a\nfamily and stuff like this, and all of a sudden, they're\ntalking about eating ass. - Right. Exactly.\n- And you're like- - The kids have to think about that. Or imagine if there's\na video of your grandma or grandpa out there when he was a kid\ntalking about eating ass. That's a horrible experience to discover that\n(Lex laughing) about your respected elder\nlater in life, it's tough. - I don't even know where to go with that. But literally the opening question was, tell me your deepest, darkest secret? - Yeah. - You just come up to somebody like that? - [Andrew] Yeah. - How often do you get a no? What's the yes to no ratio? - Well, the weird thing is like, we don't really extract\nanswers from people. What makes a good interview is when they're ready to talk. - Yeah.\n- The more you have to talk and try to get an answer out of them, - [Lex] Yeah. - it's just not a good vibe. So, we look for people who appear to be already ready to talk. Open body language, they\nseem confident and verbose and we approach them first. - [Lex] There's a look. - We wouldn't approach a shy person and be like, come on, tell me. No. - What about a person\nwith pain in their eyes? - Oh, yeah, we're interviewing them. - Yeah. So, they're ready to talk. There's just not like-\n- Yeah. - There's different ways to be ready. - [Andrew] Right. - I see homeless people a lot and they always look fascinating. And the ones I've talked\nto are always fascinating. - [Andrew] Yeah. We just did a video in the Vegas tunnels, trying to, obviously it got\ntaken down by FOX, but whatever. We-\n- I was gonna make a joke that I didn't see it. (Andrew laughing) - We tried to help a lot of\nthem by getting them IDs. And when I made the documentary, I had this idea that if I... It's a big roadblock for them\nis getting identification. Without IDs, you can't check\ninto a homeless shelter, you can't do day labor, you\ncan't qualify for housing. Nothing. So, when we interviewed them,\nthey'd basically tell us, \"If I had my ID, I wouldn't be here.\" And so, we said, okay, we're\ngonna really help this time. We're not just gonna talk to\n'em about their struggles. We're gonna actively go out\nand get them IDs at the DMV. So, we did that and nothing\nreally changed in their life. And we sat down with a recovery specialist who works directly with\nthem day in and day out. He explained to me that he's been trying to do the same thing I tried to do in a one week period\nfor the past 10 years. And that they have\ndeeper underlying traumas and pain that need to be dealt with far before they even take the steps to enter society as a housed person. (Lex deeply sighs) - That's a heavy truth right there. - Breaking that shame\ncycle has to come first, because you gotta think, I'm from a generation that\nromanticizes a vagrancy and homelessness to a certain extent, if it's called van life or if it is done in a way\nthat's like Rolling Stone, Willie Nelson hit the road. People who are above 50,\nthey feel really embarrassed to be in the spiral of homelessness. They feel like failures. A lot of them have kids\nwho they weren't there for. That's not the kind of\npain that can be dealt with by giving someone a tiny home. - Yeah.\n- It's a good step forward. But for someone to really make a change, they have to want to change. And so, it's how do you help someone and guide themselves\nin the right direction? And if you're too paternalistic and you use shame as a method\nto get them to clean up, they're gonna end up\nright where they started. - [Lex] Yeah. - That's a tough truth to accept, 'cause a lot of people\nwant a quick fix to things. And I don't blame people who go out and give baloney sandwiches\nout to the homeless. - And each case is probably\nits own little puzzle. - Each person is so complex. Now, imagine drug abuse,\n- Yeah. - what that does to the brain. - [Lex] Yeah. - Trauma, childhood trauma.\nThere's so much to unpack. And then, jus the belief that\nthey're the undesirables. That they don't deserve\nto be a part of society, because they failed a\nfundamental obligation like taking care of their kids. - If we could take a small tangent to, you mentioned this Vegas\nvideo, which is fascinating. It was taken down recently by YouTube or YouTube took it down based on - [Andrew] Yeah. It was illegal. - FOX 5, I guess. - So, the documentary was\nan hour and 45 minutes. We used 10 seconds of a news clip that was publicly\nbroadcast by FOX 5 Vegas. And according to the\nCopyright Act of 1976, you're allowed to use any\npublicly broadcast news clip in a transformative capacity\nin any documentary film or research paper or\nbroadcast or anything. They, specifically this\ncorporation called Gray Media that controls the TV stations\nin almost every small town, they had lawyers hit up YouTube and YouTube complied with\nan illegal copyright strike to get our video immediately removed. And I'm a YouTube partner. I'm in the YouTube Partner Program. So, to think that I wasn't forewarned is, it's a bit strange, but it also smells like corruption to me to a certain extent. - Yeah. You shouldn't\nhave that amount of power. At the very least, they\nshould have the power to just silence that\nfive-second clip maybe. - Yeah. But I'm taking them to court because I have the means\nto be able to do so. I'm a larger creator. I have an audience, I have that\nfinancial backing to do it. I can't imagine how many people out there are smaller creators with\nnot as much consumer, a fan base they can mobilize\nagainst someone like FOX 5 or the money to go to court. So, I want to take them all\nthe way there to set precedent for future cases, so that these giant\nmainstream media conglomerates can't copyright strike\ndocumentary filmmakers at will. It doesn't make sense. - Oh, thank you for doing that. That's really, really, really important. And that's really powerful. And it might hopefully empower YouTube to also put pressure on people to not... And YouTube is in a difficult position, because there's so much content out there, there's so many claims,\nit's hard to investigate. But YouTube should be in a place where they push back\nagainst this kind of stuff. - [Andrew] Yeah. - as a first line of defense, especially to protect smaller creators. So, what you're doing is\nreally, really important. - [Andrew] Appreciate it, man. - And it sucks that it was taken down. - [Andrew] Yeah. - Do you have any hope? - Well, I talked to my\nYouTube partner today and he said that the FOX 5 lawyers have two weeks to comply\nwith my counter appeal. But (chuckles) I spent 20 grand on human voiceovers in\nfive different languages. So, I invested probably in\ntotal, like 70k into this video. So, even if it gets reinstated, the steam's kind of been\ntaken out of its trajectory. - But also it's just like\na really important video. It's good for the world. And why-\n- Yeah. Why the hell would FOX 5 have a vested interest in\nhaving the video taken down? - I Just hate it when\npeople do that to videos or to creators that are\ndoing good in the world. - Yeah. It's not an expose\non the mayor of Las Vegas. It's an attempt to show\nthe civilian public how to get involved in a local nonprofit and potentially intervene in\nthe lives of the tunnel people. - Well, fuck FOX 5. The\nother Channel 5, as you said. - Yeah. (chuckles) - Well, thank you for pushing back - Hey, man.\n- and highlighting it. Hopefully it gets brought back up. But yeah, defending other creators, - Yeah.\n- so that other creators can take risks and don't get taken\ndown for stupid reasons. - Yeah. - So, \"Quarter Confessions\" was written? - No, it was all real life\nreality TV documentary, but it caught the attention of a larger company\ncalled Doing Things Media. - Yes.\n- And they contacted me pretty much like a week after I graduated from\ncollege in the May of 2019. And they said, \"Hey, how would you\nlike to produce a show?\" I was like, what do you mean? They were like, \"We'll get you an RV. We'll pay you 45k a year. We'll pay for gas, for\nfood, for two hotels a week. Go out there, make content, and we'll be in the background\njust powering it all.\" - And that was the birth\nof \"All Gas No Brakes\". - Yes. \"All Gas No Brakes\" was named\nafter a book that I wrote called \"All Gas, No Brakes:\nA Hitchhiker's Diary\", which chronicled the 70-day journey that we were just talking about. - [Lex] It's a tough\nbook to find, by the way. - Oh, yeah, there's\nonly a few copies left. I'm thinking about doing a reprint at some point down the line, but I sold off the last 100 copies like a month and a half ago. - Mm-hmm.\n- Yeah. - Until then, you guys should go read \"On the\nRoad\" by Jack Kerouac. - [Andrew] Yeah, read off- - You should read it.\n(Andrew laughing) I don't know if you read it before.\n- If you can't get my book, get \"On the Road\" by Jack Kerouac. - [Lex] It's great. - It's the best. - When's your birthday? I'll send you... (Andrew laughing) - April 23rd.\n- Okay. - I'm a Taurus. Coming soon. - Typical Taurus. Yeah. - Yeah. I'm a typical Taurus man. I'm a Scorpio moon. You\njust write that down. - What's the time when you were born? - [Andrew] 11:30. - 11:30 at night or... Oh, of course.\n- Yeah. Typical. This guy knew it. That's the real science.\n- Yeah. - Anyways, so all the idea of\n\"All Gas No Brakes\" as a show was to combine the, I guess, road dog ethos of the\n\"All Gas No Brakes\" book with the presentation and editing style of\n\"Quarter Confessions\". So, is to take \"Quarter\nConfessions\" on the road that was pretty much like a simulated hitchhiking experience, but with the editing and punchy effects of\n\"Quarter Confessions\", which is like, I wear a suit,\nwe do the fast zoom ins, little effects, stuff like that. It was a, man, those were the best years. It was just so fun. Imagine you're fresh out of college, you were just a doorman\ninterviewing people about making out with\ntheir cousin and stuff. And then, boom, this company\nthat you've never even heard of is willing to buy you an\nRV and give you 45k a year, which to me at the time, was more money than I\ncould possibly imagine. So, I called my dad, I was like, dad, I need you to find me an RV, 'cause he's the only guy I\nknow who knows about cars. And even he doesn't know much about cars. So, he's like, \"All right, I'm on it.\" So, the RV was 20,000.\n- Mm-hmm. - And the first event that\nwe were called to cover was the Burning Man Festival. And that was tough, because Burning Man is\nnot too keen on filming. It's supposed to be a non-commercialized escape from reality. They have a gift economy set up. It's based upon mutual\nparticipation and non-exploitation. And so, the idea of\nmaking a Burning Man video was tough at first,\nbecause burners oftentimes, and this is not all of them, but are pretty well-off in general. A lot of them have tech jobs or pretty high up in Silicon Valley. And Burning Man is where\nthey go to take off, to take the edge off, and basically become their burner persona. On the playa, they become reborn. And they take ketamine and they wear kaleidoscope glasses and steampunk hats\n- Yeah. - and they snort MDMA and\nthey run around the sand, listen to tech.\n- Do you snort MDMA? That's one.... I need to Google MDMA.\n- Yes, you can. - I thought it's a pill.\n- Yeah. - I didn't know. - It's better to take\nit in a pill or water, but you can snort MDMA. - I definitely need to take MDMA. I'm already full of love, but like that, I'd probably\ngo on another level. - Yeah, don't snort it, 'cause it'll only last like 90 minutes. - Hmm. Let me write that down.\n- Yeah. So, anyways, we didn't know what to do, because we didn't try to film. - Don't snort. - The initial idea for\n\"All Gas No Brakes\" was to, instead of asking people what's your deepest, darkest secret, it was, what's the craziest\ntrip you've been on? - [Lex] Hmm. - So, the idea was to not\nsatirize drunk people, but satirize people who are fried on acid. - Oh.\n- And so, we went to Boulder real quick. Did a test interview with some lady who talked about seeing ancestral aliens during a peyote retreat. And so, it's pretty easy to extract trip reports from hippies and gutter punks and stuff\nlike that, or oogles. So, we go to Burning Man. We start asking people like, what's your craziest trip story? And they didn't have the same type of free-flowing storytelling style that like a on the street cross punk in New Orleans might have, where they're like, \"I don't give a fuck. I'll tell you whatever.\" These people were very bottled up about what they were willing to disclose. So, we went on Burning Man\nRadio and we did a broadcast. And we said, hey, we're\npsychedelic journalists. It was me and my friend, CL, at the time. I said, we're psychedelic journalists. We're parked on 10 and I, which is a cross street\nin Black Rock City. And we said, we have a 1998\nCatalina Coachmen Sport. It's an RV. We've set up a podcast studio. We're doing a show about\npsychedelic voyages. - [Lex] Yeah. - So, lo and behold, two hours later, we had 10 people lined up at the RV - Nice.\n- willing to talk. - Nice.\n- So, that vetted people in advance for us. And so, we did a couple\ninterviews and that was that. - What were some of the\nstories from the trip reports? - There was this lady named Razma who said that she was known in several circles in Berkeley\nfor being multi-orgasmic and could create multiple\nrepeated climaxes using only her mind by squinting her eyes and squeezing her eyes together so much that the pleasure spiral just went crazy. - I feel like I talked to several people like that at Berkeley. - Yeah. You know what I'm talking about. - Not that.... Well, yeah, that lady, I think she manifest\nherself in many forms? Yeah.\n- Right. But still, it was on the cruder end. There was one guy named Kimbo\nSlice was his burner name. He talked about taking a shit after taking a quarter of mushrooms and how he was seeing his childhood and visualizing his past life as the turds were flowing into the toilet and just talks about the psychedelic union between pooing and taking shrooms. - And so, he was very\nvisual with his words. - Yeah. So, there was stuff like that. I interviewed Alex Grey,\nwhich was super cool, about his first trip in San\nFrancisco when he was in 1971, shortly after the Summer of Love. I got to do some pretty cool interviews, but still, it was semi-ambush style. I wouldn't say that we\nwere doing journalism yet. It was still comedic video work. - Was there a narrative - No.\n- that tied it together? It's like really just a trip,\ncomedic almost with the- - Interview, and then I go, Burning Man. And then, it's onto the next one. So, I guess that could\ngive a loose structure, but it's just like a\npunchy and slapstick thing. Everything was going good until we interviewed this\nguy named DJ Soft Baby. He was wearing a golden leotard with once again, kaleidoscope glasses, shirtless dancing like dancing. And he was eating chowder\nout of a plastic bowl. And he was like, \"This\nchowder is so fucking good. He is like, \"This is the best chowder\nI've ever had in my life.\" And he starts putting\nthe chowder on his face and he is like, \"I want the\nchowder all over me, yeah.\" And so, we just go, hey, man, can you just do a dance for us real quick, just for some B-roll? He does a dance. We post it on Instagram the next morning. Doing Things Media CEO calls me, Reid, he says all of our pages are down. And he's like, \"That guy you\nfilmed dancing last night on drugs putting chowder on his face, that guy's at the top of MIT.\" - Top of MIT. I don't understand what that means-\n- He went to MI-\n- That's exciting. (Andrew laughing) - Yo, my brother's a rocket science. He is like head of NASA or whatever.\n(Andrew and Lex laughing) - Well, the guy knows people in Boston. - [Lex] Okay. - Not in the Whitey Bulger\nsense, but in the reverse sense. - I have trouble believing\nthat DJ Soft Baby. - Oh, DJ Soft Baby was major.\n(Lex chuckles) It could have been Harvard\n- Major. - It could have been, but it wasn't UMass. - I don't think there's\nanybody that's at quote, at the head of MIT who's putting, what was it, all over his face? - Chowder.\n- Chowder. - Well then, you haven't\nbeen to Burning Man yet. - Okay. (laughs) - I have not been to Burning Man. - So-\n- I may have to consult my colleagues at MIT if they know DJ Soft Baby.\n- Yeah. So, whoever-\n- He probably was Harvard. Let's put it on them.\n- Okay. The Top of Harvard.\n(Lex laughing) So, he made some calls to the tops,\n- Yeah. - to the heads of big tech\n- Yeah. - and got all the Doing\nThings Media pages taken down. At the time, that was like\na vast network of pages. And we ended up having to take the, obviously, the video came down and he held the entire network\nof Instagram pages hostage. And so, that was... He made us agree to never\npost that video again, and then somehow got all\nof our pages reinstated. So, that was my first brush\nwith powerful people on drugs. And that was probably my last brush with\npowerful people on drugs. - So, what did you\ntransition into from there? - I think after Burning\nMan, we went to the south, went to Talladega race weekend, went to a Donald Trump Jr. book signing, went to a Juggalo adjacent fetish mansion in Central Florida called\nThe Sausage Castle. - A Juggalo adjacent sauce... Okay, can you run that by me again? - A Juggalo adjacent fetish\nmansion in Central Florida. - Okay. Fetish Mansion in central Florida. Juggalo adjacent fe... Every single one of those words I feel like\n- Yeah. - needs a book or something. - [Andrew] Right. - So, Jug... By the way, who are the Juggalos? Is this ICP?\n- Just ICP fans. - ICP fans. Okay, okay. - But I say adjacent, because\nit's not a Juggalo mansion, but there's a lot of Juggalos who kick it at the mansion\nand it's Juggalo-friendly. - Oh, okay. Juggalo-friendly. - Yeah, 'cause they get made\nfun of in a lot of places. - Oh, so, it's not... Okay, got it. - And Juggalos say outrageous shit and they embarrass themselves\nand they fight a lot. So, they're kind... They're on the FBI's gang list, which if you ask me and- - [Lex] ICP Or the- - The Juggalos. - [Lex] The Juggalos. - If-\n- Who is the head of the Juggalos? - It would be Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope. But there's associated acts like Twiztid and there's a whole rabbit hole. Honestly, Tech N9ne is a part of that. - Tech N9ne, I don't know who that is. Should I know who that is? - He's actually one of the\ntop selling touring rappers, despite having not that many streams. Tech N9ne is like, it's got a huge cult\nfollowing in Missouri. This is like, the Juggalos\nstarted in war in Michigan. - We should also say\nICP Insane Clown Posse. So, this is a thing, this is a movement. - Oh, yeah. If you went to Seattle\nright now and punched a cop and they booked you in county jail, - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - you may end up running\nwith the Juggalos. - Running with the Juggalos. - They're a presence in Pacific Northwest Prison\nsystem from what I've heard. - Can you tell a Juggalo from a distance? Well, they say whoop whoop. - Whoop whoop?\n- So, if you see a Juggalo, they'll say that. Also like- (Lex chuckles) I'll try to look out for that. - It's called the Dark Carnival is the mythology they abide by. - What do they define themselves? What's the ideology of-\n- A family, a family. - No, I understand, but\nwhat's the ideology? What's the philosophical\nfoundation of the- - They're anti-racist. They like to drink Faygo and also just cheap liquor\nand stuff like that. They're into drugs.\n- Yeah? - A lot of circles, if\nyou pull out a crack pipe, people will be like, I don't\nwanna drink with you anymore. If you're at a Juggalo party and someone's smoking twiz or something, it's relatively accepted. - What's twiz?\n- Meth. - Meth. Right, right. Lots of tattoos? - Yeah. The Hatchet Man\nis the most common one. So, it's a Psychopathic Records logo. It's a cartoon of a\nclown wheeling a hatchet. It's actually a pretty sick logo. - I vaguely remember enjoying\nsome of the ICP music. - [Andrew] It's good. - Yeah, it's pretty good.\nIt's funny, it's edgy. - Well, they get satirized a lot, but I got love for the clowns. And also, so when \"All Gas No Brakes\" transitioned away from\nrich elite drug parties and into the south, that's when the fun\nreally started to happen. Living in your RV in Alabama and Florida and stuff is the best. - Why? What is it about Alabama?\n- People are just so friendly down there and it's warm year-round\n- Yeah, yeah. - and people are non-judgmental\nand it's just great. The south gets hated on a lot, especially in the coastal states. Mississippi and Alabama are like the butts of a\nlot of jokes and stuff. But those are great states. - No, I love it. New Mexico,\nAlbuquerque, all those. - Oh, yeah. The ABQ is great. - ABQ, what's that? - Albuquerque. That's what Jesse Pinkman\ncalled it is the ABQ. - Oh shit. The depth of references you\nbring to the table is intense. - [Andrew] It's okay. - I met a lady in Albuquerque when I was traveling\nacross the United States and she said, \"Take me with you.\" I said, I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't. - [Andrew] Yeah. - But I think about that lady. - I think you made the right call. - I don't know. Yeah, \"On the Road\"\n- Yeah. - by Jack Kerouac. - Best book I've ever read\n(Lex chuckles) in my life.\n(Lex laughing) - There's a moment when he\nmeets a nice girl on a bus and they have a love affair. - Mm.\n- It was good. - On the bus or they- - No, no. They went to California. Well, yeah. And there was a love affair on the bus, but it wasn't sexual. It was just romantic. It was- - It was in the air. - It was in the air,\nwhich there is something in the air on the bus, like a Greyhound mega bus,\n(Andrew chuckles) that type of situation. There's something-\n- Certainly something in the air.\n(Lex chuckles) - It was a romance. There is, man.\n- Yeah. - When you travel acro... 'Cause it's like\nstrangers getting together and you're like feeling each\nother out, but you're in it. Like you each have a story. 'Cause you wouldn't be taking\na bus unless you had a story. So, especially if you're\ntraveling across country. There's something-\n- You ever taken the dollar bus from Philly to New York? The Chinatown bus?\n- Yeah, I have. Yeah. - That's a great bus. The people on that. - It's not a fucking dollar though. There's some that are five bucks. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. If you book it way ahead of time, which it's like $20.\n(Andrew laughing) I was like, this is a\nfucking lie calling it $1. - I got on the-\n- I don't know why I'm swearing. The anger came out, I apologize.\n- Hey, swearing's okay sometimes. Last time I was on the Chinatown bus, there was like a rooster\nwalking down the aisle. - Actual rooster?\n- Yeah. Watch him chilling. It was awesome. - Well, there's a nice part\nof your film with a rooster. - Mm. I forgot about that.\n- Yeah. That felt almost fake. - Yeah. - [Lex] Did you plant the rooster? - No, the rooster, there's a\nplace in Ybor City in Tampa where roosters walk around all the time. And we had a rooster parked there right by the main drag for... What did I say we had a rooster parked? We had the RV parked at\nYbor City for a long time and the rooster laid eggs\nin the undercarriage. - [Lex] Nice. - Back to the \"All Gas\nNo Brakes\" thing though. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So, it was lots, it\nwas really fun making it. And then, we started \"All Gas No Brakes\" in September of 2019. Six months later, the country shuts down and everything just hits the fan. I was actually here in\nAustin when it shut down. I was on 6th Street. I remember the... I don't just hang out on\n6th Street all the time, but I was just-\n- Yeah, you do. Come on.\n(Andrew laughing) Let's just be honest. - I do like 6th Street.\n- Yeah. - I like East Austin better,\nbut I like 6th Street too. So, anyways, the NBA shuts down.\nEverything's shutting down. So, I went down to the Dirty\n6th and I asked this doorman, I was like, are you guys\never gonna shut down? He was like, \"Fuck no, bro.\nThe Dirty 6th never closes.\" And I was like, all right,\nwe'll see about that. Next day, plywood. And then, I was like, all right, I thought my career was\nover when COVID hit. I was like, what are we gonna do? Nothing's happening anymore. There's no more parties or Talladega races or\nBurning Mans to go to. So, I went back to Seattle in the RV and I just spent four months just depressed living in the RV, trying to figure out what would happen. - But \"All Gas No Brakes\" went on still through that.\n- Well, this was the craziest thing about that period of time is that when COVID hit, I'm sure you remember\neverything turned political - Yeah.\n- overnight. In Seattle, if you went to a house party, you can get canceled, because people were like,\noh, you're a super spreader. So, if you wanted to socialize even with a group of four or more, you had to do so with your\nphones damn near turned off. And a lot of people were doing hyper social\npolicing at that time. Beyond that, in the south and\nin more conservative places, they were doing the opposite. They were trying to prove that\nthey could hang out 500 deep with no mask to make a statement\nagainst the establishment. - Yeah.\n- So, you had this polarization that\nled to more division and that's when the\nanti-vax protests started. And I went to Sacramento\nand the passion was unreal. This is about two months after\nthe COVID lockdowns began. And that was my first political\nvideo was at the Sacramento, the California State Capitol\nin Sacramento documenting the, they called it the freedom rally, but that's typically like anti-vax stuff. And it was real intensity. And that video was my most\nsuccessful to date at that time. And so, I was like, okay, am\nI a political reporter now? Am I covering politics? What's going on? - What were the interviews\nthey made up that video? What style of questions\nwere you asking would? - I don't know if you'd remember, but I was actually scared\nwhen the pandemic started. I thought that this is something that might kill us all based\nupon what I was consuming. And so, I'd ask people, what do you think about this lockdown? And I've had people say,\nI'm immunocompromised. If I get exposed to COVID,\nI have a 95% fatality rate. But guess what? I'd rather be free and dead\nthan alive, living in fear. And I was like, wow. So, it was just stuff along those lines. You had some San Diego surfers there complaining about the\nbeaches being shut down when such awesome waves were coming. - Yeah, it's interesting\nhow that really brought out the worst in people. - [Andrew] Oh, yeah. And so-\n- I'm not sure why that is. Fear maybe, paranoia.\n(Andrew sighs) I don't know. It really divided people. Like along the lines\n- Yeah. - as you mentioned, triple mask yourself or\nfight for your country. - Yeah, right. Exactly.\n(Lex laughing) Why are those the two options? (Lex laughing) That is literally what it was. - [Lex] Yeah. It's wild. - And both groups think they're fighting for the\nsurvival of something. - Yeah.\n- And so, that's where you really run into problems, when you have two polarized\ngroups who both think that their cause is for the common good. Mutual understanding is\nimpossible at that juncture. And so, after three months of almost everybody being locked\ndown, George Floyd happens. And I remember I saw the\nthird precinct burning on my phone in Minneapolis. And everyone says, \"Andrew,\nyou have to go cover this.\" And I'm somebody, like I said, police violence has been close to my heart since I was a kid. And my first thought is, I can't do that. I'm a comedic reporter. I can't go to Minneapolis and cover this. It'll be the end of my career. And I had a friend named Lacey\nwho I went to college with and she told me, she was like, \"Bro, this is your chance for\nyou to do something serious. You can actually create a meaningful piece of reporting like you always wanted to before \"Quarter Confessions\" and you can turn \"All Gas No\nBrakes\" into a new source.\" So, I called Reid who was the CEO of the company that owned \"All Gas No Brakes\". And I was like, look, man,\nI want to go to Minneapolis. I was in Orlando at the time. I was actually at The Sausage Castle. And he said- - Sorry, The Sausage Castle? - Yeah, the Juggalo mansion. - Oh, right.\n- Yeah. - That was called The Sausage Castle. - So, I'm watching\n- Right. - Minneapolis unfold on Lake\nStreet where it was burning. And I got to the Orlando airport and I booked a flight without cons... I booked it on my own card. I didn't consult my boss or anything. And I was sitting in my seat on the flight and he straight up told me, he's like, \"If you fuck this up and this destroys the brand, we're getting a different host. If you mess this up and you turn our show away from a party show\nabout drinking and drugs and all that stuff and you make this a social\njustice show, you're done.\" But I was like, I just\nturned my phone off. I got to the Minneapolis airport on the second night of the riots. And when I got to the airport,\nthere was National Guardsmen in the airport and it was\nlike a \"Call of Duty\" mission, the one in the airport. And on the speaker, they say, \"If you're arriving here right now, you are not permitted to go\nanywhere outside of the airport. National Guardsmen will escort you to your Uber or to your car. They're gonna take a picture of your ID, they're gonna figure\nout where you're going. You are not permitted\nto go outside tonight.\" And so, Lacey picks me up. There's two people in the back, two of her home girls\nwearing like shiesty masks. And I'm like, what are we\ndoing? Where are we going? And she goes, \"We're\ngonna go film the riot. We're going to Lake Street.\" And so, we drive down there, Kmart is burning, Target is\nburning, everything is on fire. She has the Sony A7. She gives me a microphone and she's like, \"Go talk to that guy.\" And that was the guy with a\nMolotov cocktail in his hand who had just burned Kmart down. And so, I go, what should I ask him? She goes, \"What's on your mind?\" So, I walk up to him and I'm\nlike, what's on your mind? He said something like, \"Everything that was happening\nhere was supposed to happen. This is how we feel. Is it right? No. Is this gonna benefit the community? No. But this is how we feel.\" - This is how we feel. That's pretty powerful.\n- Yeah. - Through a lot of the\ndocumenting that you do, this is how we feel is like - [Andrew] Yeah. - screaming through that.\n- Yeah. And I noticed that aside from\na group called Unicorn Riot, there was no one else actually\ninterviewing the protestors. The local news was on\nthe bridge 15, not 15, but five blocks away, filming just the scene\nitself, just the fire. But I saw some crazy\nthings off camera too. I saw, so there was two groups there. There was the anarchists,\nmore mobilized protestors. And then, there was just mostly African American community\nmembers who were just pissed, who had nothing to do with\nthe organized resistance. And they were all joining forces to riot. And there was this anarchist kid who ran up to White Castle\nwith like a Molotov cocktail. And he's about to throw\nit at White Castle. And this Black dude ran up\nto him and grabbed his arm and he's like, \"Nah, we\nfuck with White Castle.\" (Lex laughing) And I was like, what?\n- Yeah. - And so, you see, if you go on Lake Street,\nevery business is burned, - Yeah. White Castle stands.\n- White Castle remains. I also saw these dudes\nrip this ATM out of a bank and hit it with sledgehammers. They were a group of friends\nhitting it with sledgehammers. They're hitting it with\nsledgehammers. Boom. All of a sudden, money starts\nspraying out of the ATM. I've never seen some shit like\nthis, like pouring out of it. And then, this group of friends who were just united and getting it open, start fighting each other for the money as it's flying out of it. And so, there was just, it was like Joker from the\nBatman's army type vibes. But I got shot in the ass\nby the National Guard. It was no good. - Like a what? Rubber bullet?\n- Yeah, yeah. Not shot with bullet.\n- What did that feel like? - Honestly, it hurt. (Andrew and Lex laughing) It hurt.\n- I'm not sure what I was expecting as an\nanswer to that question. - Yeah, but-\n- I liked it. It was good.\n- Yeah. And then, after that, I posted the video and it was very well-received and that was the pivotal point where I realized that\neverything was gonna change. - There was a still a comedic element to the way you do conversations. So, the way you edit. So, did you see yourself as a potentially like a Jon\nStewart type of character- - At first, but I just think human beings are just funny in general. - Yeah. The absurdity of it. - Cool thing about Jon Stewart is like, I generally like to say that anybody who works for corporate media, whether it be Comedy Central or anything owned by\nTime Warner, FOX, MSNBC, they can't say what they want. - Yeah.\n- Because in order to climb up in those organizations, you have to appease the narrative of the company that you're\nworking for to rise in the ranks. Jon Stewart, I feel like, has so much clout in the media world that I'm pretty sure he\ncan say whatever he wants. I actually don't think that Jon Stewart is controlled by anybody. I really don't. I think that he can go on his\nshow and talk about whatever. - I do think that certain people have broken the brains of... COVID broke the brains of a lot of really great people I admire. Trump broke the brains of\na lot of people I admire. Like to where Trump derangement syndrome became a thing, like\nyou can't see the world - Yeah.\n- quite as clearly, because of it. And I think Jon Stewart is quite a genius at stepping away, even though the world\nneeded him in that time, stepping away during that moment of Trump and coming back now being able to reflect being those,\nthe other statesman. - My favorite Jon Stewart moment that illustrates that perfectly is whenever he went on the Colbert show and he was just joking\naround with Stephen Colbert, who I think, is a full-blown propagandist, about the Wuhan lab leak theory. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - And he was just goofing around and he was like, \"It's\ncalled the Coronavirus lab and they had it before.\" And now, what do we have? And it was like you could\nsee in Stephen Colbert that he was like gun\nto his head type shit. Where he is like, Jon, Jon,\nstop joking about that. - Yeah.\n- And that made me realize like, oh, everything that Jon Stewart did, especially for the 9/11 first responders, he's a true American. And not in the sense of like\nthe different political parties want you to believe as an American, not a do your part in\nsocial distance American, not a wave your Trump flag in the back of your pickup truck American. Just a guy who genuinely\nstands up for what's right. - There is a degree to which\nyou can be in those positions easily captured by groupthink though, - Yeah.\n- even when you're not controlled by bosses and money and all that kind of stuff. And I think Jon Stewart is\nmostly resistant, but it's hard. His position is difficult. - I think he's done the best job though. If someone in that\n- Yes. obviously Democrat connected - Yeah.\n- corporate media economy, he seems to be the freest talker. - Yeah. So, this is when\nyou first became famous. - I'm not even sure what fame means. I just see myself as me. - When did you get the shades? - Oh, that was on tour. That's a whole... (Andrew laughing) The shades, that's dark time. But thi... I didn't make like-\n(Andrew laughing) - This is a meme really. I don't even know if that's a symbol of fame\n- I didn't make - or whatever.\n- journalism to become famous. - [Lex] Yeah. - I made it to give people a platform to share their stories. It just so happens that\npeople liked it enough to where I became famous,\nbut if I could go back and not be the on-camera guy and just platform the stories, I would. But the reality is people need a face to attach to stuff they like. And so, that's just how it is. But yeah, I would say right\naround Minneapolis protest, Portland protest, Proud Boys rally time when I was really in\nthere is when I started to be acclaimed as more than\njust like a ambush meme lord. - Did that have effect on you, the fame? - Not at that point. - Not at that point. So, you were still able to\nhave a lightness to you? - Well, the country was basically closed. - Yeah.\n- So, it wasn't like there was a street to walk down where people were like, there's that guy. So, getting famous, famous during COVID made it so when the country reopened, it was as if like my life really changed, 'cause I was like, oh,\nall these fans I made during COVID are seeing me out of the bar. This is cool. - [Lex] Yeah. - At first, fame is the best thing ever, because you can go anywhere in the country and these spaces that you\nnormally feel a bit insecure in, - Yeah.\n- like a local dive bar, a cool restaurant, a coffee shop where you'd just be another guy, all of a sudden, they're like,\n\"Oh my god, I'm a big fan.\" They give you like free stuff. You get this sense of acceptance that you never would've gotten before, so. But there's also- - The dark side. - Well-\n- It's all love, man. Just to speak to the\nfirst part you're saying, it's just so much love that people have and they share.\n- It's amazing. I'm sure you know what it's like. - Yeah. It's beautiful. - The only downside of fame really is that you can't really\nbe anonymous again. And you have to seek out more strange environments\nto be anonymous in. Right now, I live in the desert basically and I wanna live in the middle of nowhere in the Mojave Desert. Not because I'm scared of people, but 'cause I just wannna\nbe like curious me again, - Yeah.\n- who people don't know and I can ask questions to people that I'm interested in without them going, I seen you here, I seen you there. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - That's the main thing. That's what I loved about hitchhiking. - Yeah, just to have anonymity, for sure.\n- Yeah. It's the best. But both are great. Complaining about fame\nis just the lamest shit. - Yeah. We should go to furry\nconventions that you covered. - Oh.\n- Wear an outfit. - I love furries. I should do that. - Yeah, we should go\ntogether. I go all the time. We should go together. What's your favorite outfit?\n- You've not been to a furry convention.\n- No, I have not. - I think you might like\nit more than you think. - I... (Lex scoffs) Listen, (laughs) maybe I'm just afraid to face who I really am. (Andrew laughing) - Yeah, your persona, the\ntrue Lex will come out when you're in a $3,600\n- Yeah. Everything is possible.\n- lizard suit. - Lizard? Is that what they go with? - Well, scalies are the lizard furries. - Yep.\n- And there's a big division in the community where they\nthink scalies are douchebag, 'cause the scaly suits are more expensive. They're about seven grand,\nwhereas a furry suit is 3,600. And they're also taller.\n- Yeah. - So, when the scalies pull up to the fur fest it's\nlike, ah, fuck the reptiles. - Fuck the reptiles.\nI can get behind that. I'm more like a teddy bear type of guy. - Yeah.\n- I think bear's... What's the... Maybe squirrels. I don't know. - Oh. Squirrels are so cool.\n- Giant squirrels. Yeah. - I wanna put a GoPro on one and just see what the hell they do. - You were talking about that conversation with the guy at the head\nof Doing Things Media. How did that end up? - Well, I want to clear up a few things. Reid, the CEO of Doing Things, I actually think he's a good guy. I think that he was just\ntrying to run a business. He saw what was working for his brand, which is very college-centric,\nvery festival-centric. And he was right to think that journalism and especially coverage of\nsensitive topics like COVID or police brutality would\ndefinitely not work on merch. You're not gonna sell a picture of me interviewing someone\n- Yeah. - at a riot like you would me interviewing a furry or\na drunk dude in Alabama. It doesn't work the same. So, it was a lot harder to monetize, not just 'cause of YouTube censorship, but also just because\nof the sensitive nature of the content. So, Reid was looking out for\nhimself as a businessman. There was a different partner, oh, I'm not gonna say his name, that was more connected in Hollywood. I think he's responsible for\nthe collapse of the show. - What was the collapse like? What happened?\n- So, right as the country's reopening, I get a DM from Eric\nWareheim of Tim and Eric and I'm covering something called the UFO Mega Conference\nin Laughlin, Nevada, which is a beautiful river town. And he DMs me and says,\n\"Let's make a show.\" And I'm like, oh shit, is this real? I grew up such a big fan of \"Nathan For You\" and\n\"The Eric Andre Show\" and those are produced by\ntheir company, Abso Lutely. So, I was like, hell yeah, let's do it. Three days later, I get a call that says, \"Jonah\nHill wants to hop on board.\" And I can't believe this. I'm still in the RV and\nI'm in Laughlin, Nevada. So, I'm like, Jonah Hill of \"Superbad\"? Are you shitting me right now?\n- Yeah. - 'Cause I was excited. Oh, and \"Moneyball\". Jonah\nHill's a great actor. - Oh, he's great. He's great all around.\n- Yeah. - Doesn't get the credit he deserves. Well, he's got the credit by\nnow, but still deserves more. - So, basically, just within a week, I assembled this super\nteam of Tim and Eric and- - \"Superbad\" team?\n- Yeah. Pretty much of Tim and Eric. Sorry, I'm so sorry.\n- No, that's good. And Jonah Hill. And yeah, we just pitched it around. Every single TV network\nrejected it. I don't know why. And they mainly did that, because I was in this weird situation where I had signed a contract\nwith Doing Things Media that I didn't realize\nwas called a 360 deal. That's what they use in the rap world, basically means that I can't do anything outside of them without them getting a hundred percent of the money. So, if I was to go work\nat Sbarro or Quiznos while I was working for\n\"All Gas No Brakes\", they would get my 500 bucks a\nweek from the sandwich spot. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - I was unable to earn any outside income. I didn't read the fine\nprint, 'cause I was 21 and like I told you, 45k\na year, RV sounds sick. - Yeah.\n- And basically, the TV networks were like, why would we buy a show if the digital brand's gonna\nbe running at the same time? 'Cause they didn't wanna stop doing \"All Gas No Brakes\"\nto make a TV show. They wanted \"All Gas\nNo Brakes\" to continue as a web show while \"All Gas No Brakes\" as a future TV show at SHOWTIME or Hulu or somewhere like that was\nalso concurrently running. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - Which is impossible for one man to do. And so, every TV network said,\nokay, we're not doing that. We want an exclusive rights\ncontract with this guy. Next, oh, yeah, this is\ncrazy to think about, 'cause it all happened so fast. So, Jonah Hill says A24 Films wants to do a movie instead of a show and they're gonna let you keep\nthe digital brand running. So, this meant that I could\nkeep doing my Instagram stuff with Doing Things Media\nslash \"All Gas No Brakes\" while making an A24 movie with\nJonah Hill and Tim and Eric. So, it was just like, I was excited. It sound sounded perfect. So, they said, \"Okay, what do\nyou wanna make a movie about?\" And I told them, okay, here's\nwhat's gonna happen in 2020. If Trump wins, there's gonna\nbe riots across the country. The major cities are gonna burn down. If Trump loses, the militias\nand his loyal supporters are going to try to have a coup in DC. That's what I said. And I said, so I'm\ngonna follow the lead up to whoever wins the election and I'm gonna document what happens after. So, they said, \"Okay.\" And so, I was to begin\nfilming in late October, during the campaign trail, maybe mid-October up until November. And then, in the following\nmonths to see what would happen. This meant that I couldn't film anything for \"All Gas No Brakes\", the digital show, because I had to dedicate a\nhundred percent of my time to making this perfect movie.\n- Yeah. Yes. - Still, one of the partners\nat Doing Things Media was demanding that I not\nonly produce the movie, but also more content for the show. And I told them it was only\nso many hours in a day, man. That's gonna be impossible. And I said, if you want it to be possible, I can make it work, but I want to have half of the\nmonetization from the show. 50% profit split, which I thought is fair.\n- Mm-hmm. - If you want me to do double work when I was getting almost nothing before, split me in on the profits. They fired us immediately. Me and my two childhood friends who I hired to work on the show with me we're all out of a job as we were filming for\nthe now HBO project. We got our fire notices. - The guts on that person to... 'Cause you should be owning\nprobably close to 100% of it. - I think so too, but they\ndidn't see it that way, 'cause they figured we made\nthe initial investment, we discovered him is\nhow they looked at it. So, it wasn't Reid, but\nit was the other partner who wasn't Reid who said,\n- Yeah. - \"We have tons of,\"\nverbatim he said this, \"I have tons of connections\nin the comedy world. We can replace Andrew overnight.\" - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - I'm not sure why he\nmade that miscalculation. I wish he would've thought about it twice. I wish he didn't have to\nend like that, but it did. - Why do people do that? What's the benefit of acting like that?\n(Andrew sighs) - [Andrew] I think- - Because you can part\namicably without the drama. - I think all betrayal in anything like that is\nmotivated by self-interest. Whether that be economic success, social stability, whatever it is. They figured that because\nI was being such a burden in asking for the profit, that they could just release me and find someone equally talented and not split them in so\nthey can make more money. - Oh, I see. Well, that's\na stupid way to think. - People think like that,\nman. People who are... (Andrew sighs) The word I use is like sidekick syndrome. When people are a part of the production, but they're not integral.\n- Yeah. - They start thinking that the front man doesn't\nmatter or something. And that the brains of the operation are actually the people on the periphery. And so, they start to believe that they can just shift things around and the audience won't care. Not realizing that I was actually the one who created the show and that the lore of the\nshow is connected to my rise outside of their jurisdiction,\nif that makes sense. The people who watch \"All Gas No Brakes\" watched \"Quarter Confessions\"\nand read the book. And so, you know. (sighs) - Well, this happens also\nnot just financially, but just with people that\nthey're part of a team, but they don't really contribute\ncreatively to the team and they force their opinion or pressure. - [Andrew] Yeah. - Whether it comes from editors\nor all that kind of stuff or from sponsors, there's\npressure they create when the creator alone\nshould be celebrated and have all the power, 'cause they're the ones\n- Yeah. - that are creating the thing. - In a way, I have sympathy,\nbecause I can't relate to that, 'cause I've always been the front man of my\nown projects by design. So, I'm not sure what it's like to be a, like someone's owner from\na content perspective. I don't understand the\nchallenges they face. Maybe there was something\n- True. - that I didn't understand. I don't know.\n- True. Well, oftentimes, if you\nown a thing like this, like this company, you\ndo think about brand. - [Andrew] Right. - And then, maybe you\nhave a big picture idea of what brand means and\nthat can be at tension with the creative project, right? - [Andrew] Yeah. - But ultimately, freedom for the creator is the best kind of brand.\n- Yeah. I remember all three of us who worked on \"All Gas No Brakes\" got fired at the same time. And were in the RV that Tim and Eric's company bought for us, which was a bigger RV, in the parking lot,\n- Nice. - parking lot of a\nWalmart in South Philly. And the propane had just ran out and it was 15 degrees outside. So, the RV was getting\nreally cold really fast. And I just looked at my phone\nand it was like, you're fired. And I was just like, God, help me. But I've had a couple moments like that and God does help me. - And they were always in the\nparking lot of Walmart, right? - [Andrew] Well, yeah. Although... - I know that Walmart, by the way. - The one in South Philly is great. - [Lex] Yeah, that's great. - But technically now, you\ncan't park an RV there. - Well, you're not a man\nwho follow the rules, if you know what I'm saying.\n- Well, the thing is though is Walmart, Cracker Barrel, and Big Five are supposed to technically all let RV campers park overnight. But if there's a crime problem in the city where they're at, they can lobby, individual Walmarts can lobby with the corporate to take that away. So, all the Portland Walmarts, you can't sleep there anymore. Any city with significant homelessness and petty property crime,\nthe Walmarts are a no-go. - Fascinating. So, that was a low point. - [Andrew] Yeah. (Lex chuckles) - But from there, from\nthe ashes to Phoenix Rose, - Over time. Yeah. - Channel 5 was born. - Channel 5 was born in the March of 2021 after we finished filming\nfor the HBO project. - Oh, really? So, you went all in on\nthe HBO project at the- - Yeah. We filmed the HBO project from November, 2020 up until April, 2021, damn near, we were just\npicking up the pieces, going back for individual\ninterviews, stuff like that. - So, let's go to that project. It turned out to be a movie\ncalled \"This Place Rules\". - It's supposed to be called\n\"America Shits Itself\". - Oh yeah? Maybe you can\ntell the story of the film. You have, what's his name? I wrote this down, Joker Gang\nand Gum Gang. Is that correct? - [Andrew] Yeah. The opening scene. - The opening scene of two\ncharacters just talking shit, and then getting into a fight. And I think it was really brilliant how you presented that as\na, almost like a microcosm of the division\n(Andrew chuckles) between the extremes of the left and the extremes of the right. - That's exactly what it was. I'm glad you picked up on it.\n- Yeah. And then, (chuckles) what I really liked is that the Joke, again, Joker Gang was\n- Yeah. - a little bit of a\nspoiler alert, I apologize, but at the end of the film\nwas a voice of wisdom. - [Andrew] Yeah. I just realized- (Andrew laughing) - He seems the most sane. - He was the voice of wisdom. (Andrew laughing)\nHe like cut through it. - [Lex] Yeah. - I also just realized that a lot of people are gonna stream the movie after watching this\npodcast, which is cool. - Yeah. Where do they stream it? On HBO Max. Sorry.\n- Oh, yeah. HBO Max. I never got a chance to promote the movie. - It's such a pain in the ass, man. I wish we could all just pay\non it on YouTube or something. - Yeah.\n- And HBO gets the profits or whatever, but like, it's such a...\n- Yeah. - I have to subscribe\nfor every single thing. But yes, if you wanna\nwatch it, it's really, I recommend, extremely\nhighly sign up to HBO, whatever the hell. - On the positive note,\nHBO is great to work with. They're the most professional, respectful company I've ever\nworked with pretty much. - Like-\n- Yeah, HBO has created some of the greatest TV ever. - But even on in the\nbackground, they get shit done. There's no wait time. They have some of the best\nheavy hitters on their team, for trailers, for posters. All the promotional apparatus\nthey have is super solid. - Did you get good notes from\npeople there? Like how to- - A little bit, man. But you know. - It's a truly original documentary. Meaning like, I just haven't\nseen anything like it. It's even like... So, there's a humor and a lightness at the\nright kinds of moments. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - Like I said, there's\na rooster in your... That's like, okay, that's like a non-sequitur\nthing as part of a storytelling. It intensifies and reveals\nthe absurdity of the division - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - and how once January 6th happens, everybody goes on to the next thing. - Yeah.\n- It's like, what happened to us? It was almost like a delirium that everybody was participating in. Some weird, just like, well,\nlike people say, mind virus. Like all of a sudden,\nwe just got captured. - Yeah.\n- And people just yelling at each other and doing the most ridiculous shit. And really, January 6th, the way you presented especially just reveals the circus of it all. - It really broke the fourth wall, or that's how I would describe it. Because if you were at\nJanuary 6th and the lead up, it felt like it was the beginning to a series of similar riots, but it just popped off\nso much that that was it. You haven't seen anything like it since. It was supposed to be a\nsecond one on January 20th. It was the actual inauguration\nthat never happened. It was a crazy time to\nbe alive and around. And especially the\nrelationship that I developed with Enrique Tarrio, who's the former chairman\nof The Proud Boys. He's now facing 23 years in prison. It's like a trip, 'cause I went to his house in Miami maybe\ntwo weeks after January 6th. And talking to him, it seemed like he didn't think\nanything was gonna happen. He was just like, \"Yeah,\nman, that was crazy. I'm glad I wasn't there. They're dumb for doing that.\" He even told me he doesn't\nthink the election was stolen, - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - which is just a mind fuck. It's like, why'd you get\neveryone so hyped up? (Lex chuckles) It's just weird to think about how so many people's lives are\ndrastically altered forever, because of that just\nbizarre moment in time that will always live on. - Yeah. What did you... QAnon is part of that story. What'd you learn about QAnon from that? - Just an all-encompassing worldview. That family that I talked to,\nI call them the QAnon family, but it's called the Spencer family. They were nonpolitical up until the Stop the Steal Movement began in September of 2020. And within four months, their entire life revolved around the\nmythology and lore of Q. And I've never seen in my life a psyop just devour people's\nminds in such an intense way, in such a rapid period of time. - And I love how the kids in the movie are also the voices of wisdom. - Yeah.\n- The Spencer family, it's the kid who goes through the full journey\n- Yeah. - of believing that whatever\nHillary Clinton is a lizard and just believing all the worst versions\n- Mm-hmm. - of the conspiracy theories, and then waking up was\nlike, what was the point? - Yeah, it was heartbreaking\nto see his disappointment in his dad for even following\nQanon so militantly. 'Cause he was like, I felt\nlike they let my dad down. I felt like they let our family down, because January 6th was\nsupposed to be the day, according to Qanon, that the storm happens and that the military\nis supposed to mobilize and arrest the members of the deep state, Clinton, Soros, all that. Trump was supposed to\ngo into a helicopter, you know what I mean? And take control of the\ncountry back from the swamp. And it didn't happen. In fact, the next day, he\nwas almost denouncing it. Now, he doesn't, but then, he did. And it was a really, I think\nit hurt people's pride a lot. My friend, Forgiato Blow,\nhe's a Trump rapper. He describes it that way. He says, \"A lot of people's\npride got hurt by January 6th.\" - Trump rapper. - Oh, yeah, dude. Honestly, there's some pretty\ndope Trump rap out there. (Lex chuckles) I'm serious. - There's some-\n- You're not gonna rap. - Yeah, you would think like, oh, yeah, MAGA, there's no rappers there. But there's rappers and\nthey do a pretty good job - [Lex] They're good? - at delivering the messaging\nthey want to deliver, yeah. They think of stuff that\nI'm like, that's clever. - They're like, they have\nsome political depth to 'em. - Yeah.\n- Wow. - is there something more you could say about how QAnon works? Like who's behind it?\n- Man. - What's your sense of who's\nbehind the whole thing? - I don't want this to sound rude or anything. I just don't care about\nQAnon. You know what I mean? I've put so much thought into it and I just can't seem to\ncare about it. (sighs) - Was it almost a disappointment, because to me, it was like a thing that just captured a very\nlarge number of people's minds, and then it just faded. - I guess that's why. It just seems like it's gone. And the ideas of QAnon have just bled into mainstream standard\nconservative thinking. - But there has to be a retrospective. That's the problem I have with COVID. A lot of stuff happened.\nEverybody freaked out. There's a lot of big drama around it. And now, like, oh, okay. Forgot.\n- Yeah. - Just like, moved up. What are the lessons learned? Has anyone learned any lessons? - Yeah.\n- Like what? - Exactly.\n(Lex chuckles) And what I'm saying is I\ndon't want QAnon adherence to see this and think I\ndon't care about them. - [Lex] Yeah. - But as far as who is behind\nit, the damage is done. - Yeah, but what are the\nmechanisms that made it work? That's really-\n- What do you think? Have you thought about that? - I think that these viral\nideas can be driven by, and your film shows this,\nby just a handful of people. And they're not malevolent.\n- Yeah. - They just want the clout. - [Andrew] Yeah. - And there's something sexy, there's something really sticky\nabout conspiracy theories. Especially extreme ones. You just like, some of them\ncan have this momentum. They capture the minds of a lot of people and you just go with it. - Yeah.\n- And it, like, when I hear some conspiracy theories, like there's something, like a small part of me\nthat kind of like, yeah, get excited.\n- It's possible that QAnon is a psyop to distract people away\nfrom actually uncovering - Yeah.\n- what the deep state is and who is truly running\nthings behind the scenes. Because the deep state is just the 1%. You get people so close to any type of class consciousness, and then you totally divert everything into lizard humans who live on the moon and that Hillary Clinton\nis eating babies on camera. And QAnon did just that. They wanna convince you that one, there's no conservative deep state, which is even more hilarious,\nthat Trump isn't connected to a huge rich corporate\napparatus of propagandists. And two, that the democratic establishment is the only deep state. And that some middle of\nthe road conservatives, that there's no grifters or manipulators outside of\nthat three-headed snake. - There's grifters everywhere. - Everywhere, everyone\nwants to make money, dude. This is the world that\nwe're in. It's in collapse. Everybody wants to make money. And engagement is the rule of law. So, anything, that's why\nthese news organizations follow retention incentives. They want to make money by selling ads. So, they try to create\nfear and constant division to enrich corporate media establishment. And you have people who\nare almost realizing, hey, it seems like FOX and CNN, it might be owned by the same people and are tactically using these machines to keep us divided perfectly 50/50 to ensure that the power\nstructure never gets disrupted. Then, you get these people,\nyou know who's gonna save us? Donald Trump, that's the\nguy. How is that the guy? It's not the guy.\n(Lex laughing) And I don't have TDS. I'm not an Orangemen basher who thinks about the guy all the time, but I don't think he's the guy. - You were shirtless lifting weights while whiskey or some alcohol\nwas poured into your mouth by Alex Jones in this movie. And then, you did the same to him. - That's true. Mm-hmm. - This feels like an interrogation. (Andrew and Lex laughing) So, Alex\n- Yup. - was a part of this film. He was like throughout the narrative and you had a great interview with him. What did you learn about\ninteracting with Alex, Alex Jones from making this film? - For one is that he's\nthe exact same off camera as he is on camera.\n- Yeah. - It's not an act. He told me that all real\nAmericans die before 58. He mentioned Sean Connery\nand a few others. And- - How old is he? - Getting up there.\n- Yeah. - Think early 50s.\n- Yeah. - I just found it fascinating\nhow nice his studio is. The guy's got like an MSNBC level set up. - Mm-hmm. - I actually had a great time with him. It's bizarre, because\nhaving him in that movie created so many problems for me. And when I interviewed him, I didn't necessarily portray\nhim in the best light. we joked around a bit, but it wasn't an Alex Jones\nhit piece necessarily. But I like to think that I was a bit critical\nof him in the film, especially the ways that he\nantagonized his supporters to storm the capitol or\nto follow that trajectory. He told me, when I met\nwith him, he was like, \"I know you think that\nhaving me in this movie is a good idea, but you're gonna have\nsome serious backlash because of that.\" At the time, I was like, man,\nit's fine. It's all good. We're just hanging out, drinking whiskey, doing bench presses, drinking Jameson. It's all good. First of all, I had to campaign\nto get him in the film, because the studios were like, we don't... There was a bizarre time around like, I think it was 2018 where deplatforming was the big thing that\npeople were encouraging. It said, giving a platform\nto problematic ideologies will in turn expand their reach, and so even extending your platform to someone who's\nproblematic is helping them, AKA destroying humanity, whatever it was. So, that was the whole thing. And when I did this media\ntraining that was mandated by HBO, it was all training and how to defend from\nthat exact question. They said,\n- Mm-hmm. - \"When we put you on NPR\nand we put you on CNN, they're gonna ask you about platforming problematic ideologies.\" And you're gonna have to say stuff like, sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe that extremism only goes away when you shine a light on it, because leaving it in the dark\nwill only allow it to grow.\" They gave me like 15 pointers. I didn't use any of those pointers, because I'm not the kind of person who wants to be media-trained. I like to speak freely. But in the promotional run for the film, when I went on CNN, this\nwas a crazy experience. So, I went on CNN and\nthankfully, (chuckles) my friend was with me. And so, I'm on CNN and- - By the way, your friend\nis chilling in sunglasses, laying in the couch right now.\n(Andrew laughing) Most, it's like the-\n- That's Larry Suit. (Lex laughing) It's a mix of the dude from \"Big Lebowski\" and the Brad Pitt role in \"True Romance\". - Yeah.\n- You know that reference or-\n- No, but I mean, I'm sure it describes Larry Suit. He kinda looks\n- Kinda look - like Brad Pitt.\n(Andrew drowns out Lex) - [Lex] Jack Kerouac.\n(Andrew laughing) Yeah, (chuckles) yeah. - So, HBO had a press tour set up for me and the main ones\n- Yeah. - were CNN and NPR. And so, they said, \"You're gonna go on CNN on the Don Lemon morning show and he's gonna ask you about your life, what led up to the movie,\nwhat we can expect.\" So, I get in the studio, it's about seven o'clock\nin the morning in New York at his show the night\nbefore at Times Square. So, I'm like groggy-eyed, whatever. They put the lab on me, boom. I'm live on CNN Sunday morning. And he goes, \"How would you describe\nEnrique Tarrio's mental state in the lead up to the\nCapitol insurrection?\" And I'm looking around, I'm\nlike, is this guy serious? (Lex chuckles)\nAm I sandwiched in the January 6th hit piece right now? - Yeah.\n- I thought it was about me. - Yeah.\n- And so, I told him, it's not about Enrique Tarrio, it's about how companies like FOX, MSNBC, and even your station, CNN,\n(Lex breathes out) use the 24-hour news cycle to enrage people to generate ad revenue - Yeah.\n- and pit Americans against each other during times like that. - Yeah.\n- And he said, \"There's nothing fake about CNN.\" And I said, I didn't\nsay you were fake news. I'm not saying you're lying, but you're directly antagonizing and stirring people up\nagainst half the country, because you need money to\nsupport a dying platform. - [Lex] You said that? - Pretty much.\n- Nice. - And\n- Great. I was so... My mom was watching\nand she was texting me. She's like, \"What are you doing?\" And I was like, I don't know. And so, he goes, \"Why'd you extend the\nplatform to Alex Jones?\" And I go, I don't know, I just\nwanted to drink some Jameson and lift some weights with him. At this point, I don't\nsupport that kind of media. I don't support CNN. So, I didn't give them much\ninformation about Alex, but it was very awkward. They never posted the segment online. When I got off of that interview, I had a handler that A24 assigned to me. So, I had someone with me and you could tell she was flustered. She was furious about what I just did. And so, she goes, \"I just got an email from\nTime Warner C-suite.\" And I go, what's Time Warner C-suite? She says, \"I don't know if you know this, but the same people who own CNN own HBO, and it's Time Warner.\" And so, they canceled my press tour. So, my press tour was finished. (Andrew and Lex laughing) All the late night shows\nthat I was supposed to go on. I was supposed to go\non the late night shows and that was off the table, 'cause they were worried that I was like a loose cannon, I think. And then, the only remaining appearance I had left was NPR in Boston. And that was supposed to be a premiere. So, it wasn't supposed\nto be an interrogation. It wasn't supposed to\nbe anything like that. Supposed to be a premiere in front of a live audience\nwhere they watched a film. And I show up after for a Q&A. So, I'm like, all right,\nwhatever. It's weird. They only have this one\npress opportunity left. I felt bad that I ruined\nthe entire press tour by confronting Don Lemon. But at this point, I wanted to just do this final one, especially 'cause it was a viewing. And I was like, cool, I want to... I sat in the audience, I watched people laugh to the film. It was awesome. So, I go backstage and there's an NPR\njournalist waiting for me. And nothing against people who wear masks, but she had two N95s on. Two N95s is- - [Lex] It's a lot. (Andrew chuckles) - It's over the line. So, I go, hey, great to meet\nyou. She doesn't shake my hand. - Yeah.\n- And I go, why not? - And she goes, \"You've\nbeen around some people who I don't want their germs.\" - Yeah. Oh. - And I'm like, okay, okay. This is weird. I thought this is a fun\npremiere for my movie. We sit down. The first thing she asks me is, \"How do you think the Sandy Hook families would feel about you platforming one of the most despicable Americans in history, Alex Jones,\" in\nfront of a live audience. NPR never published this. The only recordings of it are by a fan named Rob in\nBoston who put it on YouTube. It was vertical phone footage. And I literally am like, well, the Sandy Hook family's\nlawyer, Mark Bankston, who represented them in\ncourt in Connecticut, told me specifically that Leonard Pozner, the father of Noah Pozner, who died at Sandy Hook,\nwas a huge fan of the film. And so, I said that to her and that just silenced that conversation. But the rest of the whole conversation was just about exploitation and why are you platforming\nmentally ill people and giving a platform to\nconspiracies like QAnon? Don't you feel like you're\na part of their spread? Someone would call you a\nmisinformation reporter, all this crazy stuff and\nyeah, next day hit the fan. - Fuck all those people. That film, just in case you\ndon't get a chance to see it and you should, you are critical of Alex Jones in the most artful way. It was the correct way to be critical. It showed him to be more\ninterested in the grift of it. - [Andrew] Yeah. - And you didn't do it in\na like a pointing fingers and saying in the NPR way\nthat you just mentioned, but more like a human way. Like this is tragedies\nhappen all over the world and there's grifters that roll in, and then take advantage\nof it in interesting ways. - Yeah.\n- And then, human beings get swept up on either side of it and it's revealing the human,\nthe absurdity of it all. And it was done masterfully. It was done, like for\npeople who criticize you for platforming Alex Jones or whatever,\n- Yeah. - The film from a political perspective is probably leans very much left, - Yeah.\n- like heavily left. But does it without that exhausting energy of judging. - Right.\n- Just this, you know, yeah, two masks judging.\n- Yeah. It was just... (Andrew sighs) When all that was happening, when I was under fire\nfrom the mainstream press for platforming Alex Jones, I thought back to what he said to me, and doesn't mean I agree\nwith everything he says, but he told me, \"You're\ngonna be in trouble with these people if you\nput me in your video.\" And it wasn't too bad of trouble, but definitely, I do think sometimes what the film would've\nbeen like without him. And I think that it was worth it, because his scene is so funny to me and it brings me back to a\ndifferent time in my life. And I'm happy that that scene's out there. - I think it was really well done. - It showed\n- Thanks, man. - the layering of it\nall, the entertainment plus not considering from his perspective, the consequences of rallying\npeople up in this way. That it's not just, you really highlight\nthis in the interview. He keeps saying it's infowars, but then there's always a sense that infowars can turn to\nactual like civil war and- - [Andrew] Yeah. - But maybe not. Maybe\nit's all just a circus. Like we play for each other. - If you look at the speech\nhe did on January 5th, it was said, he said, \"Tomorrow, millions of patriotic Americans\nwill take our country back.\" - Yeah.\n- So, he eggs people on, and then when it gets hot, he steps away. - Yeah. But like you said, the thing he told you, he\nturned out to be right. - [Andrew] Oh yeah. - And the frogs are becoming gay. - They've always been gay. (Andrew and Lex laughing) - Well-\n- Saying frogs are straight is even crazier. - I've read stories where you kiss one and it becomes a prince and- - Yeah, that true. - A hundred percent. You think Alex believes what he says in terms of\neverything he says on infowars? How much of it is real? - He's right about big tech censorship. I think if he's right about anything, it would probably be the heads of big tech colluding together across company lines to\ndeplatform certain people. He's right about that. I think most of the things that he says follow the\nquestion everything narrative, and then everything is like a conspiracy or like a plot or a false flag. I think that he's built up a following for so long that wants him to do that. So, I think he'll question things that he probably thinks are\nrelatively straightforward, because that's the shtick of the show. The infowar is fighting misinformation and people want to see him be that guy. So, to a certain extent,\nif you're a creator who supports your family, you\ndo follow economic incentives and people want you to be the character. And so, you're gonna naturally\ngravitate toward being it. Do you feel that pressure yourself? - I did years ago. Not anymore. I feel like now, I can speak freely and really say what I\nwanna say in my new life. But when I was younger, yeah, I feel like I had to be this\nawkward, amicable, aloof guy who just didn't think\nanything about anything and just was here to listen. But now, I feel more confident\nadding some narrative and voiceover and things like that. - So, for some people especially\nwho publish on YouTube, the YouTube algorithm, they can become a slave\nto the YouTube algorithm. - Yeah. For sure, 'cause... And I definitely feel that sometimes. I know what works for\nme, but I like to think that my audience appreciates\nwhen I try new things, so I'm not totally enslaved to it. - Yeah, I try not to pay\nattention to views or any of that. - Well, you get some high views, so I'll report that for you. (Andrew and Lex laughing)\n- No, I... So, I wrote a Chrome extension that hides all the views\non anything I create. - So, you took it to that level. - Yeah, just 'cause it's a drug, man. And I'm also a number guy. Meaning like, you give me\nlike, if I do 30 pushups today, tomorrow I'm gonna try to do 35, just like enjoying\n- Yeah. - number go up. That's why I like video games like RPGs, where you're improving your skill tree, you're like getting an extra point. And there's some aspect of\nYouTube and other platforms, anything and any other\nplatform, you're like, ooh, I got more today\nthan I got yesterday. That's really, really dangerous to me, because it can influence\nhow much I enjoy a thing. - [Lex] Hmm. - Like if nobody gives a shit about it based on the numbers, you're like, oh, maybe that wasn't such a great experience. I thought it was a great experience, but maybe it wasn't.\n- Yeah. Honestly, I do actually, (chuckles) I feel that way sometimes. I'll put out something\nthat I care about a lot, but if it doesn't get\nas many views, I'm like, all right, it must have not been as good as my higher review videos or whatever. - Yeah. That's just like not true though. - [Andrew] Yeah. - And it might mean on YouTube\nthat your thumbnail sucks or something like this or whatever, however the algorithm works, but that's the thing I'm battling against to make sure I ignore all of that. - Right.\n- And it's actually something Joe Rogan has\nbeen extremely good at. He gives zero shits.\n- Yeah. - And-\n- I think it's easier to do when you're really successful. - Well, he was doing that\nwhen he wasn't successful. - [Andrew] Really? - But anything, he just follows\nthe stuff he enjoys doing and legitimately enjoys it. He happens to be really good\nat it, but he gets good, because he's doing the\nthings he really enjoys and like full on\n- Yeah. - passionate about. And that's why he'll have\nridiculous guests and just- - [Andrew] Yeah. And just like- - Just shit he enjoys doing. - Yeah. That's pretty cool. Maybe I'll one day try to do that. (Andrew and Lex chuckles) For now, I'm too attached\nto the gratification of getting a million views\nin a day and stuff like that. I'm not gonna lie to you and say that I've beat that or something, like. - Well, It's a worthy\nenemy to be fighting, 'cause it's a drug and it's one\n- Yeah. - that should be resisted for a creator, 'cause I feel like\n- Yeah. - it can do negative stuff\nto your mind as a creator. - Oh, yeah, for sure. - Anybody that controls you - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - is not good. - A lot of people are\ncontrolled by their audience. They don't have to have a puppet master on a corporate level. Audience incentive is a different type of, I don't want say slavery, but- - Yeah, it is. And that's why variety is\ngood and you're doing that. - Yeah.\n- Always expanding. Well, let me just zoom out on this. You made a film. - [Andrew] Yeah. - That's pretty cool. - Yeah, it was a great experience, man. It was awesome working with Tim and Eric. Awesome working with Jonah Hill. I feel the same about HBO and A24. Everybody that I worked on the film with, I have a lot of love for and\nI appreciate the experience. It's my first movie. It's a big deal. - [Andrew] That's a good one. - In my head, it's like I finally got to make the transition from\na YouTuber to a filmmaker and that was always this psychic barrier that I felt like I had to jump over. - There's a, I mean,\njust the way it's shot, the humor that goes throughout it, just the narration that you're doing in a shitty director's chair, - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - that was really well done. Whose idea was that? - It was actually Tim and Eric's idea. There was a really great editor named Clay who works for Abso Lutely. And they did all the editing\npretty much in the office. And so, it was Clay's idea to add a retrospective director's chair narrative arc to the whole film. - Yeah, Just like starting\nwith the absurd fight and then going like, oh, that's a good way to start a movie.\n- Yeah. - Just really, really well done. - Thanks, man. - Well, what about Jonah Hill? Like he- - [Andrew] Great guy. - He believed in this. - He did. - So, what's that like? What do you think is behind him believing in such a wild project? - I think that Jonah Hill has a good eye for what's cool\namongst the younger folks. He's into skateboarding stuff. That's why he did that film \"Mid90s\". And I think he probably\nsaw a similar thing in what was going on with\nthe \"All Gas No Brakes\" and was like, shit, this could be big. And so, not only did he\nactually fund the film, he also gave me his agent. And I forgot to mention that\nit was Jonah Hill's lawyers that he gave me for free that got me out of my contract eventually with Doing Things Media or freed me up to speak\nabout what happened. - So, he was also part of you\nkinda gaining your freedom. - Yeah, in a weird way. Even though him and I\ndon't talk that much, just 'cause he's doing his own thing, Jonah Hill is a huge factor\nin my current success and just everything that\nI've been able to accomplish. - Just on your own politics, is it fair to say that\nyour politics leans left? - I'm not really sure sometimes. I like to think that I am socially left. I think people should be able to dress and act like however they want. I don't believe in restricting people's social freedoms. Economics-wise, It doesn't seem like leftist economic\npolicy works very well on a city funding level. Like if you see what's\ngoing on in California, it seems like the city leadership is mishandling the\nfunds in California too. So, I don't know about\nthat, but I don't know, I don't really see\nmyself as left or right. I just never have. - Well, if you just objectively zoom out and don't have an insane\nstandard of the extremes, - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - it feels like a lot\nof your work leans left. - I tend to lean toward like\nthe empathetic perspective, which I do think is more\non the left and the right. But I also, I'm not into\nsuper like PC stuff. I don't believe in limiting\nfree speech either. I don't believe that... I believe in a free internet, which I think is more\nembraced now by conservatives. - But it does seem that,\nmaybe you can correct me, but I get the sense sometimes that the left attack\ntheir own very intensely. - It does happen. But every\ncommunity has terms of exile. (Lex chuckles) Think about what happens\nin the conservative realm. Like when Black Rifle Coffee company denounced Kyle Rittenhouse,\nthey lost a lot of money too. It's not the right attacks its own too. Think about Bud Light and stuff like date. - Terms of exile, like-\n- I mean, every community has (chuckles) terms of exile. You just gotta know who\nyou're engaging with and you gotta make that\ndecision carefully. - It'd be nice if\nthere's an actual writeup of the things you're not\nallowed to say for each thing. And then, I wonder\n- Yeah. - whose list would be longer. It just does feel like the last list - Right.\n- is a little longer. - If you're a conservative and you have a T-shirt with\na demon on it, say goodbye. You know what I mean?\n(Andrew and Lex chuckles) There's certain stuff that they freak the hell out about. - And conservatives are really\nconcerned about pedophiles. - Yeah. I don't like pedophiles either, but I don't think about it all the time. - It's one of the things\nyou do in the film is confront one of the QAnon folks where his concern is that\neverybody's a pedophile and you showed to him- - Well, calls himself a pedophile hunter and makes videos exposing\ndemocratic elite pedophile cabals and is himself a convicted child molester. There's an old thing that people\nsay that every confession, every accusation is a confession to a certain extent.\n- Yeah. - So, it's bizarre that\nsome people's whole life after a big mistake will revolve around trying to seem like the good guy instead of taking\naccountability for themselves. - [Lex] Yeah. - It's a common thing\nyou see all the time. Like neighborhood watch\npeople, you know what I mean? What made you that? What did you do, bro? That you feel like you have\nto get karmic retribution by doing the reverse. I don't get it.\n- Yeah. Do you think to the degree, you have bias that\naffects your journalism? - No, but with the migrant\nsituation, I don't know. - What was that covering that like? - I just got a lot\n(Andrew drowns out Lex) of hate from conservatives for letting the migrants\ntell their stories about their journey and stuff. - Well, what did you learn\nfrom just going to the border? - Just the sheer desperation that the citizens of the world are in. There's people who truly\nbelieve that America is the only hope for their success and to feed their family. And I think a lot of 'em\nare getting catfished. - Meaning America has its problems too? - It has severe problems.\nThere's extreme poverty here. - But in America, if you just\ncompare to other nations, the level of corruption is much lower to where the opportunity for a person to succeed to rise is higher. - I wish success on\neverybody who comes here, but my thing is the\nexpectation that they have and the American dream propaganda they've been installed with isn't necessarily a reflection of contemporary American reality. So, I'm talking to people\nwho speak no English and say I'm here for a better life. I go, where are you gonna go?\nThey say, \"I have no idea.\" And I'm like, man, that's tough. And you almost think how\nbad are things elsewhere for someone to abandon their family, make this journey across\nmultiple continents, and end up here with no plan? And it just made me realize how sheltered I am to a\ncertain extent as an American. And walking back what I said a little bit, 'cause I was just trying to make a point, - Yeah.\n- But what I think of as bad poverty, like\nlet's say West Baltimore or Ninth Ward New Orleans,\nis nothing compared to what's going on in almost\nhalf of the world, if not more. And so, it just made me\nzoom out a little bit. Sometimes you forget\nabout third world poverty when you live here for so\nlong and you get programmed to believe the worst\nthings that are out there is like Kensington, Philadelphia or Tenderloin, San Francisco. But those are just microcosms of more or less functioning cities. Despite what they might\nlead you to believe, Philadelphia is a great\nplace, so is San Francisco, but there's places where\neverywhere is really run down. - Yeah, and like, people\nfocus on in major cities in the United States like homelessness. Somehow, that's a sign of a fallen empire. - Right.\n- But that's a problem. There's definitely... It reveals some mismanagement\nof cities and government- - Homelessness in Seattle and San Francisco is for sure a result of the housing crisis,\n- Mm-hmm. - especially post-COVID and all the gentrification\nthat preceded it. And it's unfortunate now\nthat the conservative media is saying like, look at Biden's America as if Biden created homeless people. And it's just disappointing, because once again,\nyou're seeing the media use real issues that should\nconcern every US citizen and causing people to point fingers at a different political party as responsible for the\nsuffering of others. - Do you think January\n6th can happen again? - [Andrew] No. I don't think so.\n(Lex inhales) - So, all the lessons were learned? - Yeah, for sure. People\ngot really screwed over. - Don't you have a sense\nthat there's a greater and greater growing questioning of the electoral process\nand all this kind of stuff? - I think that Americans overall are very comfortable with\nour standard of living. I think people like going to Sonic and waiting in their car\nand getting milkshakes. And people like going to the AMC Theaters and they like going ice skating and mini golfing and going\nto the bar after work. I don't think that anyone wants a collapse of the basic structure of the country. Even the most politically divided don't want to see 7/11 go away. We are so comfortable. If you look at other countries, even Europe, look at how they protest. And look at the Arab Spring. Those guys were talking like January 6ers and they actually took\ncontrol of the government. - Yeah.\n- And so, think about even if the MAGA crowd took over the capitol\nbuilding, it's just a building. I don't know.\n(Lex chuckles) I just think that Americans, when they talk about civil war stuff, it's just so, we're so far from that. Even if the rhetoric is as divided as it was in 2020, it won't happen again. - For it to really happen, there has to be a level of desperation. - There has to be a level\nof economic desperation that's causing people to starve or some basic resource going away. Water, something like that. - Who do you think wins, Trump or Biden? - In the civil war? - Well, we don't like\n- No, - the guns.\n- in the game of \"Mario Kart\", no.\n(Andrew chuckles) In the (chuckles) election 2024. - Oh, man. I have no idea, man. I don't even know if I'm gonna vote. - It's weird that this is our choice. - I know. I wish people were more\nfocused on city politics. I'd rather vote like yes\nor no for a bike lane in my neighborhood than I\nwould for the president. - So, local politics to you is where it is.\n- I think the- - And you feel it. Yeah. - Oh, your vote actually matter. Let's say you have a\ncommunity of 500 people and you live in Henderson, Nevada. You can influence whether\nor not there's a bike lane or this is gonna be a\nplayground or an ampm. You get to choose and you can\ninfluence a hundred people to choose and boom,\nthis is your community. You can't influence the\nresult of an election. - Still that those at\nthe presidential level, it sets the tone of the country. And so, Trump running again\nand Biden running again, it just feels like\nthere's going to be a lot of questioning of election results. - I just can't believe those are our guys. - [Lex] Yeah. - That's really our guys? (Lex chuckles) That's where we're at? All these smart people\nwe have in this country. The great history. - We got Joker Gang versus Gum Gang. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - Where'd you find Joker Gang? - Well-\n- Is he a legit Juggalo or is he just-\n- No, no, no, no. Joker Gang is like a Miami Cuban guy. - [Lex] Oh. - It's Joker 305 rawest Chico alive. So, me and...\n(Lex chuckles) I had been following him for\na long time on Instagram, 'cause he used to post videos\nof himself popping Percocets and smoking blunts on\nthe toilet freestyling. - Yeah.\n- And so, I had followed him for a while. And then, I finally got this platform and I said, oh my god, I bet you now that we\nhave a million followers, Joker Gang will sit down with us. And lo and behold, the clout did its thing and there I was face to face with the man. - There was a controversy a year ago where a woman came forward and said that you were pushy with her. You respected and know\nyou got the consent, but you were pushy about it. - Mm.\n- Looking back, can you tell the story of that? What are the lessons you learned from it? - Yeah, I've yet to speak on\nthis for a lot of reasons. Mostly 'cause it was a hard time and it's a sensitive subject and I've wanted to\nprioritize the reporting. But I think that now I'm\nready and able to do so. Everything started on December 30th, 2022 and that was the release\ndate of the HBO project. Like I told you, we didn't know when\nmovie was gonna come out. We weren't told that it was gonna come out on that date until early November. And so, it was like,\noh my god, here we go. We got a movie coming out. HBO had... I didn't even know it was gonna be them. So, every day for those (chuckles) 50 days to where I received word and\nto the movie announcement or to the movie release, I was like a kid waiting\nfor Christmas morning. You know what I mean? It was like every day, I just... I saw the movie release date as the first day of the rest of my life. - Mm-hmm.\n- And so, I remember the week of the movie release, it was like every day I was like, oh my god, six days, five days, four days. And when it became two\ndays, I was so excited and so honestly anxiety-riddled, because it was such a massive platform that I went out to the desert by myself out in the Mojave, got a\nhotel, and just sat there. And then, movie release day comes, it was supposed to come out at 8:00 PM Pacific Standard Time. I remember it was like 12\nhours left, 10 hours left. And then, 8 minutes\nbefore the movie, at 7:52, or I guess it was 10:52 East Coast Time, I got a text message requesting a portion of my fat HBO check to contribute\ntoward apparently years of therapy bills that\nthis person had accrued after she says that she felt that I pressured her into\ngiving consent years prior. And I was confused, not\nonly because of the timing, but because this is someone that I hadn't seen in years\nor spoken to in years. And I presume that I\nwas on good terms with. So, I didn't respond to the text message. And then, when I didn't respond, about seven days later, this\nperson made some TikTok videos and with the help of some friends, launched an online campaign. They got picked up by\nthe press pretty quickly. - So, what did you feel\nlike when you got that text? - Well, it's tough, because on one hand, I'm not opposed to restitution being part of a private accountability\nprocess for real abuse. If you've hurt someone to an extent that it took them out\nof work or something, I think they're entitled to some money. But unfortunately, as I later learned, this person had legal counsel and this was an attempt to\nbasically create evidence by extracting a confession\nfrom me to use as precedent for a civil lawsuit to the tune\nof a couple million dollars. - It's dark. - Yeah. - How did you meet this person? - Well, I met them when I was 22. And like I told you, I was living in an RV making this show called\n\"All Gas No Brakes\". And I would travel between\ncities every other day. And so, I would basically pick a new city and I got in this pretty bad\nhabit of what I would say is essentially treating\nInstagram like a dating app. I would go to a new place,\nI'd post my location, I'd surf the DMs, and I would\nlook for fans to meet up with. It wasn't always girls. It was just people to party with, 'cause I was also partying every night, but a lot of times, ended\nup being girls and stuff. And so, that's how this situation was. I didn't have sex with this person. Had a consensual encounter that they reached out to me\nabout two weeks after saying, \"Hey, I don't want you to\ntake this the wrong way. But looking back, I\nfelt a lot more pressure to agree than I realized in the moment. I don't think this is any fault of yours. I just think that you\ncame on a bit too strong and I didn't want to let\nyou down, so I gave in.\" That language made me feel horrible. Mainly because if this person had told me, hey, I don't wanna hook up, I would've said, yeah, of course not. I don't want to hook up with someone who doesn't wanna hook up with me. And I think that as fame\nincreased during that time, I think I was just oblivious\nto how people were seeing me, especially those who had\na digital relationship with me prior to me knowing them. And I don't think that I\nhandled that the right way. - Well, thank you for\ntaking accountability. But just to clarify, you got consent? - Yeah, I was the initiatory party in an interaction with a fan who felt it she had to say yes, because\nof, I'm not sure why. I don't know why, but like I said, this person also disclosed to me, they had a history of childhood trauma and were actively being treated for PTSD and that they felt things move too fast for them given their situation. And so, I told her, I said,\nhey, if you wanna reach out, if you wanna talk on the\nphone, I'm always here for you. I'm sorry to hear that. Let me\nknow if we can talk further. About six months after that,\nI was at Sturgis bike week and I remember this day,\nthis was the hardest day. I was just chilling and I\ngot a text from my friend and said, \"Hey, man, you're\ngetting canceled right now.\" And I was like, what do you mean? Did someone find an\nold tweet or something? What are you talking about? And I opened my phone and it\nwas this Instagram story of me, it was like the ugliest\npicture of me you can find. It was like my face open,\nit was like screenshotted. And it said, I remember this specifically, 'cause I just couldn't believe it. It said the ugly loser who hosts \"All Gas No\nBrakes\" is a piece of shit. He knowingly abused my\nfriend and got away with it. If you follow him, I'm gonna\nmessage you and ask you why. So, this person who I don't know, I didn't even know who that\naccusation was coming from. They emailed every production company that I was working with, DMed hundreds if not thousands of people. Just saying that I was this piece of shit and I didn't even know\nwho this person was. So, I was frantically calling and texting every person\nthat I'd seen intimately for the past year and being\nlike, hey, are we on good terms? Is everything okay? And then, I figured out that the person was coming from Florida\nand I knew who it was. And so, thankfully, I reached\nout to the original person who I had the communication with and I said, hey, I think\nthis might've been you, this might've been your\nfriend who posted this. Are we good? I'm sorry. I apologized again. I was like, listen, I feel\nbad that you feel this way. I wanna do anything\nthat I can to help you. Again, I apologize. And she said, \"Apology accepted. I'm sorry, my friend asked if\nshe could post on my behalf. And I'm sorry, I was going\nthrough a lot mentally and I saw your fame increasing. And so, I agreed to let\nher speak on my behalf.\" And we made amends in private. I said, okay, I'm here\nfor you. Let me know. And she said, \"Apology's enough. Thank you for taking the\ntime to speak with me.\" And that was two years\nprior to this text message being sent to my phone eight\nminutes before the movie. So, naturally, I wanted\nto go on my platforms and talk about what was happening, but I also didn't wanna mess\nup the rollout of the movie, and so the PR firm was like, \"We got this. We'll handle this for you.\" And that was, I guess by way, of a TMZ thing that said\nAndrew Callaghan is devastated. I'm not sure why they thought that that was gonna make\npeople be in my favor. But it was just a picture\n- Yeah. - of me on NBC that said, Andrew Callaghan,\ndevastated by allegations. That was their plan, I guess, to show that I was\nremorseful or something. - How much of this do you think lawyers pushing this when money\nand fame are involved? - Well, I wish I could say the lawyer, but I just can't, that\nwas involved in this. But I will tell you that I try to lean away from resentment and toward accountability completely. What was my role in the situation? How can I never make someone\nfeel like that again? What can I do? What changes can I make\nto make sure that, one, I never treat someone this way, and, two, to never be\nin that position again. - Well, again, thank you\nfor taking accountability. - And the main reason I talk about that is because it wasn't just that person. There was multiple people who made videos reporting\nsimilar behavior. And so, it's obvious that that was a pattern\nof behavior of mine. And so, I made the\napology video to announce that I was taking some time away, because I just needed time away. My entire support system collapsed. My friends at the time disappeared. I was getting obituaries\ntexted to my phone that were like, hey, it's\nbeen nice knowing you. It was great to see you grow. Good luck. Like I was dead. And yeah, it got dropped from my agency. No one gave me tough love. No one called me to ask\nme if I was all right. It was just only everyone\ndisappeared in a week. - Again, thank you for\ntaking accountability, but I just hate how many\ncowards are out there. Like when people\n- Yeah. - hit low points is when you should help, when you should stand with them\nif you know their character. - Yeah. And it was just... It was hard to separate\nthe initial situation that I knew was more or less a setup and the possibly genuine other accounts. And so, it was like, all\nright, you know what? At this point in my life, I wanna be on the right side of history. I don't wanna be the\nanti-cancel culture mouthpiece. I don't have the mental\nstrength to fight this. Especially because I was\nenvisioning the HBO drop to be this like, the world\nopens up to me moment and it was just the reverse. But it wasn't so much the media reporting on it that hurt me. It was just little stuff\nlike a childhood friend that you love seeing, they\nunfollowed you on Instagram. Or just seeing someone on the\nstreet that you grew up with and waving at them and they\ndon't do anything back. And you're just like, oh my\ngod, man, this is my new life. But what are you supposed to do? Thankfully, I somehow two weeks after, I met an amazing partner who\nI'm still with to this day. And I was able to conquer\nmy two biggest fears, which is monogamy and dogs. I was terrified of dogs and terrified of having a girlfriend. Now, I have a girlfriend\nwho I love and two dogs. (Andrew sighs) So- - What was the lowest point? - Well, right after this happened, I entered like a recovery programs. Started with AA, but then I\nfound a more specialized program that dealt with the issues\nthat I was dealing with. I'd say the hardest point was logically deducing that the lives of my loved ones would be better off if I was gone, you know what I mean? And thinking that my mom and my friends, that their life would be better if I took myself out of the picture. And for one, I just figured,\ntheir friend's canceled. Her son is a disgrace. My family's gonna think\nthey raised me wrong and my friends, I'm a social\npariah now, I'm a burden. I'm better off dead. And the hard part was I would read stories and books written by parents\nwho lost their kids to suicide and they reported feeling a\nlot of anger after the suicide. So, I tried to think of\nwhat's the way I can do it to get the least amount of anger on behalf of the people who would grieve. 'Cause the hanging,\nsomeone will discover you. So, I figured that\ndrinking myself to death would be the way to do\nit, and I wasn't able to. Yeah, that was just a dark place. I remember hating the people who loved me, because I knew they would grieve and that made me mad, if that makes sense. I was ready to go. I had no will to live. But their grief was like,\nI didn't wanna cause that, because I didn't wanna hurt them. So, I was like, I hated\nthe people who loved me, 'cause they were stopping\nme from taking my own life. And it's weird to think that\nwhen I was going through that, if you walk by me in the street,\nI look like a normal guy. And so, now, when I walk\naround and I see people, I think to myself, you have no idea what that\nperson is going through. It's crazy that so many people are suffering in complete silence and they don't wear it on them. - Many of the people you\ntalk to are probably that. - Yeah.\n- Many people you've interviewed before,\nall this and after, are probably going through some shit. - I also thought if I could write down what I just told you on a piece of paper and I was to do it and\nthen they found the note, they would take it more seriously, 'cause they would know\nthat I wasn't lying. - [Lex] Yeah. - But then, if you do it, it reduces the lifespan of\nyour parents by 15 years. So, I looked at it like I was\ntaking time away from them. - Well, thank you for the most part, leaning towards accountability,\nit's the right path to take. What advice would you give to young men that look up to you on\nhow they can be good men, especially in regard to women? - If you have any kind of platform, doesn't have to be famous on Instagram, it could be like if you're a pillar of your community in the\nculinary world or whatever it is, just be hyper aware of that and remember that you are\ninheriting a power dynamic that can create situations where there might be some pressure that you don't even realize is there, but it's definitely there, and you just have to be aware of that. And two, when meeting new partners, having hookups and stuff like that, just try to have a\ntrauma-informed conversation about their past. Really know the experiences\nand the backstory of what a new partner has gone through in\nthat world of intimacy. Whatever they're comfortable\nto share obviously. But I would advise\nagainst one-night stands. I would advise against\nhooking up with someone that you're meeting for the first time. Have those conversations prior, because even though it might sound like a\nvibe killer, it's not. And if you think that that\nconversation is a vibe killer, you probably shouldn't be in that situation in the first place. Especially now how\nhypersexualized things are and how common that type of violence is, you need to be able to\nhave those conversations and stop and say, hey, tell me\na little bit about your past. Is there any triggers that\nmake you uncomfortable? Let me know how I can be\nthe best partner to you. And I'm sure that college-aged people are not having those conversations, but I'm sure that it would go a long way. - So, especially when\nyou're young college-aged, you don't have enough\nexperience to be able to read a person without\nhaving that conversation. 'Cause a lot of times, you can see the trauma without\nexplicitly talking about it. - Yeah.\n- That takes experience and knowledge and seeing the world. When you're young, you\nreally don't know shit. Making things a bit more explicit is probably better.\n- Yeah. And also as men, we're trained to believe that it's our duty to\nbe the initiatory party in any type of sexual encounter. Like, oh, like man chases\nwoman. You know what I mean? You have to be the one to make the move or like she's playing hard to get if she's resistant to your\nfirst compliment or something. I think that that's not\nalways how it has to be. And that extra caution needs to be placed if you're taking the initiatory\nrole in an interaction, especially if someone has\na traumatic background. They might agree to do something with you, because they're scared and you might not realize\nthat's what's going on. But because you don't see\nyourself as a predatory person. You don't see yourself as someone who would ever consciously\nmake someone uncomfortable or cross a boundary. But people have histories\nthat you might not understand. And for me, as someone\nwho doesn't have much, honestly, like childhood\ntrauma or anything like that, it's been an interesting year for me working in therapy and elsewhere, understanding how that affects the mind. And also, I understand that\nhurt people hurt people and that someone with\na traumatic background isn't going to have sympathy for applying that traumatic\npain to someone else, even if that person isn't the cause of what\nput them in that spot. - If we can go back to Channel 5, can you tell the origin story of that? - Yeah, Channel 5, during\nthe \"All Gas No Brakes\" days, we used to tell people that\nwe were called Channel 5 if we wanted them to stop antagonizing us\nwhile we were filming. 'Cause every town has a Channel 5. So, when people were\nlike, \"What's this for?\" If they were being super rude and trying to get in the\ncamera and be hella obnoxious, we would just say, oh, we're Channel 5. And they would be like, \"Oh,\nmy grandma's gonna see that.\" And they would leave us alone. So, Channel 5 was a diversion tactic during \"All Gas No Brakes\". And it just so happened that\nwe were in Miami Beach one time and this kid came up drinking liquor, trying to yell about whatever they yell about in Miami Beach, like titties or whatever. And we're like, bro, this is Channel 5. Be careful what you say.\nAnd he was like, \"For real?\" And he just walked off. And I said to my friend at the time, I was like, that sounded\npretty good, right? - Yeah.\n- The Channel 5. And he goes, \"That does\nsound pretty good.\" He's like, \"That's gotta\nbe trademarked though.\" No. (Lex laughing) It's not trademark. - Yeah.\n- It's crazy, right? There's a Channel 5 in every city, Channel 5 KTLA, Channel\n5 Seattle, KOMO News. Dude, Channel 5 itself, we own it. (Andrew and Lex laughing) - Yeah.\n- \"cause no one's thought of something that simple. 'Cause you'd think you'd have to specify. We own channel5.com,\nchannel5.news. Dude, we own it. It's awesome.\n(Lex laughing) - So, it was the same kind of\nspirit as the previous thing. - [Andrew] Yeah. - What was the first one you\ndid Under the Channel 5 flag? - Miami Beach spring break. (Lex chuckles) - I think I've seen that.\nAnd it's gonna be a callback. I think somebody mentioning\neating ass there too. - [Andrew] That would be the place. - I believe that was- - There's only about five places in the US where people yell about eating ass all the time.\n- Mm-hmm. - Bourbon Street,\n- Yeah. - South Beach, Miami,\n6th Street in Austin, Broadway in Nashville, and I'm just gonna go\nahead and say Times Square. You might not think it, but. - Times Square. Really? - Yeah. They yell about ass there. - Times Square. - I would say Beale Street in\nMemphis, but it's not good. - Oh, yeah. (laughs) - Beale Street is like the median age is too high on Beale Street\nfor anyone to yell about ass. (Lex sharply inhales) (Lex sighs) - Oh, this is a fascinating portrait of America through that specific lens. So, Miami Beach.\n- Yeah. - And then, how would\nyou describe your style of interviewing just now that\nyou've collected so many? If you had a style, how would you describe your style?\n- I guess before especially, it used to be like deadpan. Now, I would describe it as more directed, but still relatively affable, agreeable, deadpan interview style. - Yeah, there's a, like\nin the face of absurdity. - Yeah.\n- You're just like there with a microphone. There's a comic aspect to it. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - And that's intentional.\n- Yeah. I used to look at the camera like Jim from \"The\nOffice\" back in the day. - Yeah.\n- I don't do that anymore. - What about the editing? How do you think about the editing? - I still do most of it,\nbut Susan helps a lot too. It's my associate. Yeah, the editing style, like I said, we pioneered this editing\nstyle that honestly, was inspired a bit by Vic Berger, but we took it to real life. Crash zooms, chopping up vocals a bit to add comedic timing where\nit didn't necessarily exist. You might add two seconds\nof awkward silence that are built with room tone or you might make everything really fast by cutting silence and switching frames, I mean switching camera angles. But now, we try to be\npretty straightforward, 'cause we wanna be taken more seriously. (Lex chuckles) - Yeah, sure. What's\ncrash zoom, by the way? - A crash zoom is when the,\nlike it's artificial zoom that you might add in Adobe Premiere, where the camera zooms\nin on someone's face. - Where the resolution is not there. - The resolution's not there unless you have like a\nBlackmagic cinema camera. - Which you don't. - We don't. We don't use those. The file size is too big.\n- Make it slo-mo. The file, that's the only constraint? - Yeah.\n- Okay. - A hundred percent. - And you also do voiceover storytelling. - I think the first time I really did that was in the San Francisco Streets video, because there's so much content about San Francisco homelessness,\nTenderloin shoplifting. But there's not that much\ncontext in those videos about the history of San\nFrancisco, the housing crisis, nimbyism, random zoning\nstuff that sounds boring, but has a major role in the current situation\non the streets there, as to why the Tenderloin\nneglected by police and by the city council and the other neighborhoods\nlike Knob Hill, and North Beach are so nice. So, I added that purposely\nto the San Francisco video and then also to the\nPhiladelphia Streets video to accentuate the reporting and add some historical analysis. - What's your goal with\nsome of these videos? Like the Philadelphia Streets one? Is it to reveal the full\nspectrum of humanity? Or is it also to tell a\nstory that's almost political about the state, or is-\n- Well, number one is always humanization. That's the primary goal, is to\ntake people in circumstances where they're often news items and remind the public\nthat these are people with lives and concerns\nand dreams just like you. But secondly, we also wanna start introducing more\nsolution-oriented journalism. So, not just, oh my god, I'm becoming aware of\nhow horrible this is, but what can you actually do to help? And as you can see with\nthe Vegas tunnels video, people are responding\npretty positively to it. Here's how you can maybe\nhelp a homeless neighbor, help get them an ID, help\nthem qualify for housing, or get a job at the scrap yard. There's always ways to help. But so much of the YouTube\nworld is oversaturated by just endless videos\nof people suffering. And the comments are always\nlike, wow, so horrible. But what does that really do for somebody? - You've interviewed many rappers. - [Lex] Yes. - Educate me. - There's a lot to it.\n- Yeah. Can you explain this drill rap situation? What is drill rap?\n- It's an evolving situation. Drill began in 2010. Some people say it was\nChief Keef in Chicago. I think it was King Louie in Chicago. But I think all of it was very influenced by Waka Flocka Flame, who dropped an album\ncalled Flockaveli in 2010 that was hyper violent,\nadrenaline-boosting rap music made by people who were\nactually in the streets. So, in the '90s, you had 50 Cent, you had rapers rapping about\nwhatever gangster shit, selling crack, and beating people up, but they weren't actually doing it. Drill has a true crime\ncomponent to where drill fans want to know that the person rapping about catching bodies\ndoes in fact kill people. So, drill is, it's pretty horrifying. It sounds great, but\nit started in Chicago, then it spread to England, and now it's bounced back to New York, like the Bronx and Brooklyn specifically, and spread from New York\nto the rest of the country. So, now, there's probably a drill rapper every 10 square miles. - So, these are, as opposed to pretending to be a gangster and killing people, you get some credibility\nby actually doing it. - Yes. And the fans are typically not in the communities that\nare affected by poverty. So, they're like\nsuperheroes to White kids. (Lex chuckles) - It's dark. - And not just White kids, but just anyone who's not in the hood. It's not necessarily a race thing. There's White drill rappers too. Slim Jesus was a big one. He's out of the picture now, but there's White drill rappers. - Slim Jesus. You made a video on O-Block.\n- Yeah. - What is O-Block? The place, the culture, the people, you- - O-Block is a housing\nproject in South Chicago, in the Englewood area where\nMichelle Obama grew up. It's also where Chief\nKeef was born and raised. I don't know if he was born\nthere, but he was raised there. And he is the forefather of modern drill music as we know it. So, these are the projects\nwhere Drill began. It's also the first place where\nyou have that intersection of drill music and true crime, because O-Block has a lot of rappers. And then, nearby is an\narea called St. Lawrence AKA Tookaville, which has\na lot of rappers as well. And so, these two rival\ndrill gangs basically have a lot of history and it\nconnects to music at large. - So, you've interviewed people there. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - Was there any concern for your safety? - No, I think that O-Block\nhas calmed down a lot. For one, it has security, so you can't even really get in and out. But two, I think that O-Block's trying to rebrand itself a lot,\nbecause it could be, 'cause Lil Durk's avoiding a RICO charge. Could be for a variety of reasons. I know you don't know\nexactly what that means, but. (Lex laughing) - Lil Durk-\n- Rapper Little Durk is affiliated with O-Block.\n- Yep. - And a lot of people have been murdered in retribution for\nkillings that Lil Durk may or may not have influenced\nthe ordering of, but anyways.\n- And Lil Durk (Andrew chuckles) documented the killings via rap music probably.\n- No. Okay, I know you don't know about drill, but Lil Durk was associated\nwith a rapper named King Von. And King Von perhaps paid\nfor the assassination of a rapper named FBG Duck who got killed in Chicago's\nGold Coast neighborhood. It's possible. The O-Block 6 are drill-associated, not rappers, but just shooters, and they perhaps operating\non King Von's behalf, went and killed FBG Duck. King Von was Lil Durk's\nartists. King Von's now dead. So, there's a definitely a concern that some of the Fed\ncharges will fall on Durk. Not sure if that's true, but it's rumors in the hip hop community. So, O-Block right now,\nand when I film the video, is trying to go through\na major image rehab. If you go on any Instagram\nof anyone in O-Block, they've all converted to Islam. And so, they post pictures of themselves praying in the morning and have captions like, put\nthe guns down, let's pray. So, I think when I went there, they saw it as a good opportunity to\ndo a positive rebrand. And so, I interviewed a\nrapper named Boss Top, who was there all the way back in 2011 when Chief Keef was coming up. And so, he basically\nensured my safe protection. But he didn't even need to. They're all very friendly and they know exactly what's\nup with YouTube stuff. - I like how 2011 is the\nold days, like the ancient, - Oh, yeah.\n- the founding fathers. - [Andrew] I was in eighth grade. (Andrew and Lex laughing) (palm taps) - Oh, man. Time flies\nwhen you're having fun. - [Andrew] It sure does. - Lil Durk. Where's the Lil Durk now? - [Andrew] Atlanta. - Hmm. So, you left Chicago. - Yeah.\n- Not safe. - Yeah, every rapper has\nto leave their hometown. It's what I did. - It's a journey. (Andrew and Lex laughing) - Seattle would've taken me out, bro. - You do interview a lot of people. That's like a top comment, but it speaks to the reality of the fact that you always find somebody\nrapping or you, yeah, you create the space for people to rap. - Yeah.\n- What's that about? - I don't know, man.\n- Well, they're usually really good. - [Andrew] You think so? - I appreciate it. - Well, hell yeah, man. - Rappers,\n- In their own way. - since I touched a microphone, rappers have gravitated toward me. - [Lex] Mm-hmm. - I think there's something happening- - You're a rapper whisperer? - I think there's something happening on a deeper cosmic spiritual level - Yeah.\n- that lets the mind of rappers know that\nthey have a safe place in front of our camera crew. - You have an interview with Crip Mac? Who's-\n- I do. Free Crip Mac. (Lex chuckles) He's in jail right now. - Oh, he is?\n- Yeah. - Is that a hashtag? Free-\n- Yeah, for sure. - That's an intense interview.\nPeople should go watch it. People should go watch\nall your interviews, but that one is pretty intense. - [Andrew] Thanks. - I was a little afraid for your life. - Oh, Crip Mac's the\nsafest guy in the world. - [Lex] He's a sweetheart. - Oh, definitely, dude.\n- Yeah. But it's fun. - I feel more safer on Crip Mac than I do with any given pedestrian. - Yeah, he was loud and flavorful, - Yeah.\n- I should say. So, who's he? What's his story? - Well, his name's Trevor. He grew up in Ontario,\nCalifornia in the Inland Empire. Moved to Texas with his\nmom after his dad left. His mom started dating a cop\nfrom Houston named Mr. Gary. His mom found Mr. Gary getting anally penetrated by a coworker, and so she booked Crip Mac a one-way Greyhound ticket to\nLA where he joined the Crips. - That's a good story. (Andrew and Lex laughing) (companion faintly speaks) - It's true.\n- Oh, you've jumped right to Mr. Gary\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.\n- in 10 seconds- - Yeah.\n- So good. - I'm just saying that he's a classic case of somebody without a father\nfigure who found camaraderie and sense of belonging and purpose in a street gang, which in LA is like a rule\nof law in most of the city. - I forget what context earlier, talking about martial arts and fighting and he's gotta work on\nhis punching for him. - Yeah, I think so. He gets into a lot of\nfights in jail though. And from what I've heard, he wins about half of them,\n- He does that? - so (faintly speaks)\n- All right. What'd he go to jail for now? - Firearm possession. It\nwas a probation violation. - [Lex] Oh. - It's too bad. - All right. So, Philly, you went to the border, - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - occupy Seattle protests,\nyou went to Ukraine. - [Andrew] Yeah. - What are some interesting things that stand out to you from memory? Just as I asked the\nquestion, some interesting- - I was in jail at the border for a while. That was horrible. - [Lex] What was that like?\nWas that your first time? - Yeah, well, I didn't know that I couldn't hop my\nown border as an American. I'm thinking, this is my country. I can get in any way that I want. Wrong. You can only enter the US through an official port of entry, which I learned the hard way, 'cause I got arrested by border patrol and held as a detainee at a\nmigrant center for a few days. - What was that like? - Horrible. - [Lex] Which aspect? - Well, for one, I don't know. It was just to be in a place like that and I probably sound like\nsuch a wimp right now, 'cause I know someone's watching this who's done some hard time. But we thought we were gonna\ndo at least six months in jail, 'cause the guards freaked us out and were like, \"You're being\ncharged with a federal crime. You know what you boys did is serious. We're waiting on word from San Antonio about whether or not we're\ngonna extradite you.\" So, we're just sitting\nin these cells alone, most of the time in solitary\nwith no pillows, just a- - [Lex] No pillows. - No pillows, no mat, nothing.\n(Lex laughing) Just a space blanket. And\nI was sleeping on my shoes. - Yeah.\n- Stinking up the place. It was no good. - You mentioned the UFO convention. - [Andrew] Yeah. - What have you learned from\nthose guys? The ufologists. - I really wanna know\nwhat you think about that. That's the one question\nthat I wanna reverse on you, because you've talked to so many people. Do you think that aliens\nhave actually visited Earth? - Yeah, so.\n- When? - When? Exact dates? I do... I think there's alien\ncivilizations everywhere and I talk to a lot of people\nthat have doubts about it. I just think... I even suspect there's a intelligent alien\ncivilization in our galaxy. And I just can't imagine\nthem not having visited us. So, I lean on that. What that actually looks\nlike, I don't know. The stuff we're seeing in\nterms of UFO sightings, I think that's much more likely to the degree it's real, it's much more likely government projects. So, military, Lockheed\nMartin, this kind of stuff. - So, you think that they\nhave knowledge of it? - Yeah, yeah. - One thing I think about\nwith aliens is scale. So, we have this idea that an\nalien would be a gray alien or a almost humanoid lookalike that would visit us in human\nform, arms, legs, head. But who's to say that they're\nnot able to shrink down to microscopic size with\nthe same neural capacity? - Yeah. Or just have a very\ndifficult to perceive form. - But they would go small, not big. - No, I think that would\ntake a humanoid-like form just to be able to\ncommunicate with humans. I think that the big challenge with aliens is to be able to find a common language. So, if you come to another planet and you suspect that there's some kind of complexity going on, but it looks nothing like humans, you have to find a common language. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - And I think aliens would try to take physical form that's similar, - Yeah.\n- that us dumb humans would understand. - Language is really interesting too. I have this series that I'm gonna announce for the first time on here, but I'm really interested in\nendangered languages in the US. There's like 150 languages in the US with less than 1,000 speakers. - Wow.\n- And I wanna help spearhead efforts to\npreserve some of these. Like for example, Hawaiian sign language, 15 of those people left. - [Lex] Holy shit. - Because when Hawaii got annexed, the ASL community tried to make it, so the deaf native Hawaiians wouldn't be able to speak\ntheir native sign language. And so, they would do it under the desks at schools for the deaf and blind. And they would get their mouth washed out with soap and stuff if they so much as did\nthe Hawaiian hand signs. Also, the Gullah Geechee language in the South Carolina Sea Islands. Hilton Head Island and\nstuff, that's like a, it's almost a Creole language\nthat's been in the US for hundreds of years\nexisting in isolation, that's being threatened by\ngolf course developments. I don't know how into language you are, but I've been getting\nsuper nerded out about it. - Actually, I'm interviewing\nsomebody tomorrow who's an expert in human language. He's from MIT, studying the\nsyntax of a lot of languages, including in the Amazon jungle, the peoples that live in\nthe Amazon jungle region. Yeah, it's fascinating. Human\nlanguage is fascinating. And also the barriers that creates. And also how the games are played to what you're speaking by governments. This is part of the story\nof Russia and Ukraine is a battle over language. The Ukrainian language is\na symbol of independence, which is why they are trying to make it the primary\nlanguage of the nation. - Mm-hmm.\n- And so, sometimes, the language represents the\nculture and the peoples. - Yeah.\n- And it's like intricately tied to the culture\n- Yeah. - of the people. - I've been trying to learn Navajo. - Which languages do you know? - Spanish and English. - Spanish well? - Si. (Lex laughing) - I don't know Spanish that well. So, that passes me. Yeah, dude,\n- Okay. - you're fluent based-\n- That means yes. - Oh, it doesn't.\n(Andrew chuckles) Hola. (Andrew and Lex laughing) - That was good.\n- Yeah. - That was real Cancun spring break. - Well, I actually speak fluent Spanish according to Spotify, 'cause every episode is\ntranslated over dub by AI in Spanish.\n- Oh my god. - [Lex] Yeah, there's a very- - You have a Spanish\nrobot assigned to you? - As a Spanish robot, I sound like incredibly intelligent and intellectual in Spanish. - Not a Fridman. - Exactly. (Lex chuckles) From everything you've done,\nall the people you've seen, do you think most people\nare good (inhales) underneath it all? - Yeah. - So, the ones that do\nall the extreme shit- - Okay, I'll put it like this. Most people think they're doing the best\nthing for the world. I don't think anyone, except for maybe a small\nfraction of sociopaths, wakes up every day and says, I'm gonna fuck somebody's life up today. I think the far majority of people are fighting for what they think is right and do want to see America succeed and want us to be in a happy place where no one is subjugated. I just think people have\ndrastically different ideas of what means will get us there. And unfortunately, that's leading to a lot of misunderstandings between cultures. And yeah, I think that\nmost people are good. I've been through some things\nthat leads me to believe that a lot of people though are primarily motivated by self-interest. And that in a fight or flight situation, most people will choose flight. So, I don't know if people\nare courageous as a whole, but I think generally good. But the energy to stand up for what's right, I'm not sure about that. - They have the capacity though - Yeah.\n- to do good. - I think human beings are\ninherently selfish as well. But I don't think that\nselfish is inherently bad. I think humans are primarily\nmotivated by self-interest, but generally have positive intentions. - I do hope more humans\nrise to the occasion and have courage, courage of their convictions,\ncourage to have integrity. But yeah, I think that\nmost people are good and they want to do good and they have the capacity\nto do a lot of good. - [Andrew] Mm-hmm. - That's why I have hope for this whole thing we got going on. How do you heal the misunderstandings between people you think? - Listening. It's the only option we have. No forced education, no forced meetings or mediations between political opponents. Just listen to more\npeople and really listen. Try to get rid of whatever\npreconceived notions you might have about how you should feel about someone you are\nsupposed to disagree with. And just keep your ears\nand your heart open to people that you don't know\nand your life will change. - Keep your heart open. - A lot of people are scared to listen. - Well, Andrew, I'm a big fan and thank you for being one of the best listeners in the world. - Hey, man.\n- And showing the full spectrum of humanity to us, so we can listen as well and learn. And just thank you for doing\neverything you're doing. Keep me-\n- Hey, man, thanks so much for having me on. You're a great man.\n- Thank you, brother. - I appreciate it. - Thanks for listening to this conversation\nwith Andrew Callaghan.

Thompson. \"The edge, there is no\nhonest way to explain it, because the only people who really know where it is are the ones\nwho have gone over.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
