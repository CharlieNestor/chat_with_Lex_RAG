      "text": "- Whenever we start a new project, it has to have these ingredients\nof simultaneous complexity. It has to be novel in terms\nof the synthetic biology, material science, robotics, engineering. All of these elements that are discipline-based\nor rooted must be novel. If you can combine novelty\nin synthetic biology with a novelty in robotics, with a novelty in material science, with a novelty in computational design, you are bound to create something novel. (curtain whooshes) - The following is a\nconversation with Neri Oxman, an engineer, scientist,\ndesigner, architect, artist, and one of the kindest, most thoughtful, and brilliant human beings\nI've ever gotten to know. For a long time, she led the Mediated Matter\nGroup at MIT that did research and built incredible\nstuff at the intersection of computational design,\ndigital fabrication, material science, and synthetic biology, doing so at all scales, from the micro scale\nto the building scale. Now, she's continuing this work at a very new company\nfor now called Oxman, looking to revolutionize how humans design and build products working\nwith nature, not against it. On a personal note, let\nme say that Neri has, for a long time, been a\nfriend and someone who, in my darker moments,\nhas always been there with a note of kindness and support. I am forever grateful to her. She's a brilliant and a\nbeautiful human being. Oh, and she also brought me a present, \"War and Peace\" by Tolstoy, and \"Meditations\" by Marcus Aurelius. It doesn't get better than that. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Neri Oxman."

      "section": "Biomass vs anthropomass",
      "text": "Let's start with the universe. Do you ever think of the\nuniverse as a kind of machine that designs beautiful\nthings at multiple scales? - I do, and I think of nature\nin that way in general, in the context of design, specifically, I think of nature as everything\nthat isn't Anthropomass, everything that is not\nproduced by humankind, the birds and the rocks\nand everything in between, fungi, elephants, whales. - Do you think there's an intricate ways in which there's a connection\nbetween humans and nature? - Yes, and we're looking for it. I think that from, let's say,\nfrom the beginning of mankind, going back 200,000 years, the products that we have designed have separated us from nature. And it's ironic that the\nthings that we designed and produced as humankind, those are exactly the\nthings that separated us. Before that we were to totally\nand completely connected. And I want to return to that world. - But bring the tools of engineering and computation to it?\n- Yes. Yes. I absolutely believe that there is so much to nature that we\nstill have not leveraged, and we still have not understood,\nand we still haven't... And so much of our work is designed, but a lot of it is science, is unveiling and finding new truths about the natural world that\nwe were not aware before. Everybody talks about\nintelligence these days, but I like to think that\nnature has kind of wisdom that exists beyond intelligence\nor above intelligence. And it's that wisdom that we're trying to tap\ninto through technology. If you think about humans versus nature, at least in the realm, at least in the context\nof definition of nature, is everything but Anthropomass. And I'm using Ron Milo, who is an incredible professor\nfrom the Weizmann Institute, who came up with this definition\nof Anthropomass in 2020 when he identified that\n2020 was the crossover year when Anthropomass exceeded\nbiomass on the planet. So all of the design\ngoods that we have created and brought into the world now outweigh all of the biomass, including, of course, all plastics and wearables,\nbuildings, cities, but also asphalt and concrete, all outweigh the scale of the biomass. And actually, that was a moment, you know how in life\nthere are moments that (Lex laughs)\n(laughs) maybe a handful of moments that get you to course correct. And my, it was a Zoom\nconversation with Ron, and that was a moment for me when I realized that imbalance, ugh, now we've superseded the\nbiomass on the planet. Where do we go from here? And you've heard the expression\nmore phones than bones and the Anthropomass and the Anthropocene and the technosphere sort of\noutweighing the biosphere. But now we are really trying\nto look at is there a way in which all things\ntechnosphere are designed as if they're part of the biosphere. Meaning if you could today\ngrow instead of build everything and anything, if\nyou could grow an iPhone, if you could grow a car, what\nwould that world look like? Where the Turing test\nfor sort of this kind of, I call this material ecology approach, but this notion that everything material, everything that you design\nin the physical universe can be read and written to as, or thought of or perceived\nof, as nature-grown. That's sort of the Turing\ntest for the company, or at least that's how I started. I thought, well grow everything. That's sort of the slogan.\nLet's grow everything. And if we grow everything,\nis there a world in which driving a car\nis better for nature than a world in which there are no cars? Is it possible that a world in which you build buildings in cities, that those buildings in\ncities actually augment and heal nature, as\nopposed to their absence? Is there a world in which we now go back to that kind of synergy\nbetween nature and humans, where you cannot separate\nbetween grown and made, and it doesn't even matter? - Is there a good term\nfor the intersection between biomass and Anthropomass, like things that are grown? - Yeah, so in 2005, I called\nthis material ecology. I thought, what if all material, all things materials,\nwould be considered part of the ecology and would have an impact, a positive impact on the ecology, where we work together to help each other? All things nature, all things human. And again, you can say that wisdom in nature exists in fungi. Many mushroom lovers always\ncontest my thesis here saying, \"Well, we have the mushroom network and we have the mother trees,\nand they're all connected. And why don't we just\nsimply hack into mushrooms?\" Well, first of all,\nyes, they're connected, but that network stops when\nthere is a physical gap. That network does not necessarily enable the whales in the Dominican to connect with an olive tree in Israel to connect with a weeping\nwillow in Montana. And that's sort of a world\nthat I'm dreaming about. What what does it mean for nature to have access to the cloud? The kind of bandwidth\nthat we're talking about, sort of think Neuralink\nfor nature, you know, since the first computer, and you know this by heart\nprobably better than I do, but we're both MIT lifers. We today have computational\npower that is 1 trillion times the power that we had in those times. We have 26.5 trillion times the bandwidth and 11.5 quintillion times the memory, which is incredible. So humankind, since the first computer, has approached and accessed\nsuch incredible bandwidth, and we're asking, well, what\nif nature had that bandwidth? So beyond genes and\nevolution, if there was a way to augment nature and allow it\naccess to the world of bits, what does nature look like now? And can nature make decisions for herself as opposed to being guided and guarded and abused by humankind? - So nature has this inherent\nwisdom that you spoke to, but you're also referring to\naugmenting that inherent wisdom with something like a\nlarge language model. - Exactly.\n- So compress human knowledge, but also maintain whatever\nis that intricate wisdom that allows plants, bacteria, fungi to grow incredible things\nat arbitrary scales, adapting to whatever environment and just surviving and thriving, no matter where, no matter how. - Exactly. So I think of it as large molecule models and those large molecule models- - (laughs) Love that.\n- Of course, large language models are based on Google and search engines and so on and so forth, and we don't have this data currently. And part of our mission\nis to do just that, trying to quantify and understand\nthe language that exists across all kingdoms of life, across all five kingdoms of life, and if we can understand that language, is there a way for us to\nfirst make sense of it, find logic in it, and then generate certain computational tools that empower nature to build better crops, to increase the level of biodiversity? In the company, we're constantly asking, what does nature want? Like, what does nature\nwant from a compute view? - If it knew it, what could\naid it in whatever the heck it's wanting to do?\n- Yeah. So we keep coming back to this answer of nature wants to increase information but decrease entropy, right? So find order, but constantly increase\nthe information scale. And this is true for what\nour work also tries to do, because we're constantly trying to fight against the dimensional\nmismatch between things made and things grown, right? And as designers, we are educated to think in X, Y, and Z, and that's pretty much where\narchitectural education ends and biological education begins. So in reducing that dimensional mismatch, we're missing out on opportunities to create things made as if grown. But in the natural environment, we're asking, can we provide nature with these extra dimensions? And again, I'm not sure what nature wants, but I'm curious as to what\nhappens when you provide these tools to the natural environments. Obviously with responsibility,\nobviously with control, obviously with ethics and moral code. But is there a world in which nature can help fix itself using those tools? - And by the way, we're talking about a company called Oxman. - [Neri] Yeah, just a\nfew words about the team. - Yeah, what kind of humans\nwork at a place like this that are trying to figure\nout what nature wants? - You know, I think\nthey're first like you, they're humanist first. They come from different disciplines and different disciplinary backgrounds. And just as an example, we\nhave a brilliant designer who is just a mathematical genius and a computer scientist\nand a mechanical engineer who is trained as a synthetic biologist. And now we're hiring a microbiologist and a chemist, architects of course, and designers, roboticist. So it's really, it's Noah's\nArk, right? Two of each. - And always dancing between\nthis line of the artificial, the synthetic and the real, what's the term for, and the natural. - Yeah, the built and the\ngrown, nature and culture. - Yeah.\n- Technology and biology. But we're constantly seeking\nto ask how can we build, design and deploy\nproducts in three scales, the molecular scale,\nwhich I briefly hinted to. And there in the molecular scale, we're really looking to understand whether there's a universal\nlanguage to nature, and what that language is, and then build a tool that I think and dream of it is the iPhone for nature. If nature had an iPhone, what\nwould that iPhone look like? - Does that mean creating an interface? - Yeah.\n- Between nature and the computational tools we have? - Exactly, it goes back to\nthat 11.5 quintillion times the bandwidth that humans\nhave now arrived at. And giving that to nature and seeing, you know, what happens there? Can animals actually use this interface to know that they need\nto run away from fire? Can plants use this interface\nto increase the rate of photosynthesis in the\npresence of a smoke cloud? Can they do this, quote\nunquote, automatically without a kind of a top-down\nbrute-force policy-based method that's authored and deployed by humans? And so this work really relates to that interface with the natural world. And then there's a second\narea in the company which focuses on growing products. And here we're focusing\non a single product that starts from CO2.\n- Mm-hmm. - It becomes a product. It's consumed, it's used,\nit's worn by a human, and then it goes back to the soil and it grows an edible fruit plant. - So we're talking\nabout from CO2 to fruit. - Yeah, it starts from CO2\nand it ends with something that you can like literally eat. - Yes. - So the world's first\nentirely biodegradable, biocompatible, bio renewable product. - That's grown?\n- Yes. Either using plant\nmatter or using bacteria, but we are really looking at\ncarbon recycling technologies that start with methane or wastewater and end with this wonderful\nreincarnation of a thing that doesn't need to end\nup in a composting site, but can just be thrown into the ground and grow olive and find peace. And there's a lot of textile-based work out there that is focused\non one single element in this long chain, like,\noh, let's create, you know, leather out of mycelium or let's create textile out of cellulose. But then it stops there and\nyou get to assembling the shoe or the wearable and you, and\nyou need a little bit of glue and you need a little bit of this material and a little bit of that material to make it water-resistant,\nand then it's over. So that's one thing that\nwe're trying to solve for, is how to create a product\nthat is materially, computationally, robotically novel, and goes through all of these\nphases from the creation, from this carbon recycling\ntechnology to the product, to literally how do you\nthink about, you know, reinventing an industry\nthat is focused on assembly and putting things together\nand using humans to do that. Can that happen just\nusing robots and microbes and that's it?\n- And doing it end-to-end. I would love to see what this- - It looks cool. (laughs)\n- Factory looks like. - And the factory is great\ntoo. I'm very, very excited. In October, we'll share first renditions of some of this work. And in February we'll\ninvite you to the lab. - I'm there.\n(Neri laughs) - I've already applied.\nI haven't hear back. I don't understand.\n(Neri laughs)"

      "section": "Computational templates",
      "text": "Okay, let me, just before\nwe get to number three, it'd be amazing to just\ntalk about what it takes with robotic arms, or in general, the whole process of how\nto build a life form, stuff you've done in the past,\nmaybe stuff you're doing now, how to use bacteria, this\nkind of synthetic biology. - Yeah.\n- How to grow stuff by leveraging bacteria. Is there examples from the past and- - Yes, and just take a\nstep back over the 10 years of the Mediated Matter Group,\nwhich was my group at MIT, has sort of dedicated itself to, bio-based design would be a suitcase word, but sort of thinking about that synergy between nature and culture,\nbiology and technology. And we attempted to build\na suite of embodiments, let's say, that they ended\nup in amazing museums and amazing shows and we wrote patents and papers on them, but\nthey were still n of 1s. - Mm-hmm.\n- Again, the challenge, as you say, was to grow them. And we classified them into fibers, cellular solids, biopolymers, pigments. And in each of the examples, although the material was different, sometimes we used fibers, sometimes we used silk with silkworms and honey with bees and or comb as the structural material. With vespers, we used\nsynthetically engineered bacteria to produce pigments. Although the materials were different and the hero organisms were different, the philosophy was always the same. The approach was really an approach of computational templating. That templating allowed\nus to create templates for the natural environment, where nature and technology could duet, could dance together to\ncreate these products. So just, just as a few\nexamples with silk pavilion, we've had a couple of\npavilions made of silk. And the second one,\nwhich was the bigger one, which ended up at the Museum\nof Modern Art with my friend, an incredible mentor, Paola Antonelli, that pavilion was six meter tall and it was produced by silkworms. And there we had different\ntypes of templates. There were physical templates\nthat were basically just these water soluble meshes upon which the silkworms were spinning. And then there were\nenvironmental templates, which was a robot basically\napplying variation of environmental conditions such as heat and light to guide the\nmovement of the silkworm. - You're saying so many amazing things, and I'm trying not to interrupt you, but like one of the things\nyou've learned by observing, by doing science on these\nis that the environment defines the shape that\nthey create or contributes or intricately plays with\nthe shape they create. And so like, and that's one of the ways you can get to guide their work is by defining that environment. By the way you said hero\norganism, which is an epic term. (Neri laughs)\nSo that means like is whatever is the\nbiological living system that's doing the creation. - And that's what's happening\nin pharma and biomaterials. And by the way, precision ag and food, new food design technologies\nas people are betting on a hero organism is the\nsort of how I think of it. (Lex speaks indistinctly)\nAnd the hero organism is, sometimes it's the palm\noil or it's the mycelium. There's a lot of mushrooms\naround for good and bad, and it's cellulose or it's, you know, fake bananas or the workhorse E. coli. But these hero organisms are\nbeing betted on as like the, what's the one answer\nthat solves everything? Hitchhiker's Guide, 42.\n- 42, yeah. - These are sort of the 42s of, you know, of the enchanted new universe. And back at MIT we\nsaid, instead of betting on all of these organisms,\nlet's approach them as almost like movement in a symphony. And let's kind of lean\ninto what we can learn from each of these\norganisms in the context of building a project in\nan architectural scale. And those usually were pavilions. - And then the computational templating is the way you guide the work of this. How many did you say, 17,000? - 17,532. So each of these silkworms\nthreads are about, you know, one mile in distance\nand they're beautiful. And when, and just\nthinking about the amount of material, you know,\nit's a bit like thinking about you know, the length\nof capillary vessels that grow in your belly\nwhen you're pregnant to feed that incredible new life form. It is just, nature is amazing. But back to the silkworms,\nI think I had three months to build this incredible pavilion, but we couldn't figure out how\nwe were thinking of emulating the process of how a silkworm goes about building its\nincredible architecture. This cocoon over the\nperiod of 24 to 72 hours, and it builds a cocoon\nbasically to protect itself. It's a beautiful form of architecture and it uses pretty much\njust two materials, two chemical compounds,\nsericin and fibroin. The sericin is sort of\nthe glue of the cocoon. The fibroin is the fiber-based\nmaterial of the cocoon and through fibers and glue, and that's true for so\nmany systems in nature, lots of fiber and glue. And that architecture allows\nthem to metamorphosize. And in the process, they vary the properties\nof that silk thread. So it's stiffer or softer depending on where it is in the\nsection of the cocoon. And so we were trying to\nemulate this robotically with a 3D printer that\nwas 6-axis KUKA arm, one of these baby KUKAs, and we're trying to emulate\nthat process computationally and build something very large. When one of my students, now an a brilliant industrial\nengineer roboticist on my team, Marcus, said, \"Well, you know, we were just\nplaying with those silkworms and enjoying their presence when we realized that if\nthey're placed on a desk or a horizontal surface, they will go about creating their cocoon. Only the cocoon would be flat, because they're constantly\nlooking for a vertical post in order to use that post as\nan anchor to spin the cocoon. But in the absence of that post, on surfaces that are less\nthan 21 millimeters and flat, they will spin flat patches and we say, aha, let's work with\nthem to produce this dome as a set of flat patches\nand a silkworm mind you, is quite an egocentric creature. And actually the furthest you go, you move forward in evolution\nby natural selection, the more egoism you find in creatures. So when you think about termites, right? Their material sophistication\nis actually very primitive, but they have incredible ability to communicate and\nconnect with each other. So if you think about the\nentire, all of nature, let's say, all of living systems as like a matrix that runs across two axes. One is material sophistication, which is terribly relevant for designers, and the other is communication. The termites ace on communication, but their material\nsophistication is crap, right? It's just saliva and feces\nand some soil particles that are built to create these\nincredible termite mounds. The scale that when compared\nto human skyscrapers transcend all of buildable scales, at least in terms of what we have today in architectural practice, just in relative to the\nsize of the termite. But when you look at the silkworm, the silkworm has zero connection and communication across silkworms. They were not designed to connect and communicate with each other. They're sort of a human design species because the domesticated silk moth creates the cocoon, we then produce the silk\nof it, and then it dies. So it has dysfunctional\nwings. It cannot fly. So, and that's another problem that the sericulture industry has, is why did we in the first place, author this organism 4,000\nyears ago that is unable to fly and is just there to basically live as, to serve a human need, which is textiles. And so here we were fascinated by the computational kind of\nbiology dimension of silkworms. But along the way, by\nthe way, this is great. I never get to tell the full story. This is so great.\n- I'm enjoying this so much. (Lex laughs)\n- I'm always, like people say I speak in Nietzschean paragraphs They're way too long. And this is wonderful.\nThis is like heaven. - Nietzschean paragraphs.\n(Neri laughs) You drop us so many good\nlines. I love it, okay. - But really, those\nsilkworms are not, yes, they're not designed to\nbe like humans, right? They're not designed to\nconnect, communicate, and build things that are\nbigger than themselves through connection and communication. - So what happens when you add 17,000 of them communicating if that- - That's a really great question. What happens is that at some point, the templating strategies,\nand as you said correctly, there were geometrical\ntemplating, material templating, environmental templating,\nchemical templating, if you're using pheromones\nto guide the movement of bees in the absence of a queen.\n- This is so cool. - Where you have a robotic queen. - Uh-huh. Robotic queen?\n- But whenever you have these templating strategies, you have sort of control\nover nature, right? But the question is there a world in which we can move from templating, from providing these\ncomputational material and immaterial physical\nand molecular platforms that guide nature, almost\nlike guiding a product, almost like a gardener, to\na problem or an opportunity of emergence where that\nbiological organism assumes agency by virtue of accessing the\nrobotic code and saying, now I own the code. I get to do what I want with this code. Let me show you what this\npavilion may look like or this product may look like. And I think one of the\nexciting moments for us is when we realized that\nthese robotic platforms that were designed initially as templates actually inspired, if I may, a kind of a collaboration and\ncooperation between silkworms that are not a swarm-based organism. They're not like the\nbees and the termites. They don't work together and\nthey don't have, you know, social orders amongst them, the queen and the drones, et cetera. They're all the same in a way, right? And here, what was so exciting for us is that these computational\nand fabrication technologies enable the silkworm to\nkind of hop (laughs) from the branch in ecology of worms to the branch in ecology of\nmaybe human-like intelligence where they could connect and communicate by virtue of, you know, feeling or rubbing against each other in an area\nthat was hotter or colder. And they were, so the product\nthat we got at the end, the variation of density of fiber and the distribution of the\nfiber and the transparency. The product at the end seems like it was produced by a swarm silk community, but of course it wasn't. It's a bunch of biological\nagents working together to assemble this thing that's really, really fascinating to us. How can technology augment or enable a swarm-like behavior in creatures that have not been\ndesigned to work as swarms? - So how do you construct\na computational template from which a certain\nkind of thing emerges? So how can you predict\nwhat emerges, I suppose? - So if you can predict it\ndoesn't count as emergence. Actually, I think. (laughs)\n(Lex laughs) - That's a deeply poetic line.\n- We can talk about it. - I mean, it just kind of-\n- It's a bit like if you measure it, it\ndoesn't count. (laughs) - (laughs) Right Right. - Speaking of emergence, an empowerment, because we're constantly\nmoving between those as if they're equals on\nthe team, and one of them, Christoph, shared with me\na mathematical equation for what does it mean to empower nature and what does empowerment\nin nature look like? And that relates to emergence, and we can go back to\nemergence in a few moments, but I want to, I want to say it so that I know that I've\nlearned it. (laughs) (Lex laughs) And if I've learned\nit, I can use it later. - Yeah. And maybe you'll figure something\nout as you say it, also. - Of course Christoph is the master here, but really we were thinking again, what does nature want? Nature wants to increase\nthe information dimension and reduce entropy. What do we want? We kind of want the same thing, we want more, but we want order, right? And this goes back to your conversation with Joscha about stochastic versus deterministic\nlanguages or processes. His definition, or the definition he found was that an agent is empowered if the entropy of the\ndistribution of all of its states, it's high, while the entropy of the distribution of a\nsingle state given a choice, given an action is low. Meaning it's that kind of, yeah, duality between opportunity,\nlike starting like this and going like this, opening and closing. And this really, I think is\nanalogous to human empowerment. Given infinite wide array of choices, what is the choice that you\nmake to, you know, to enable, to empower, to provide you\nwith the agency that you need? - And how much does that making\nthat choice actually control the trajectory of the system? That's really nice. So this applies to all\nthe kinds of systems you're talking about?\n- Yeah. And the cool thing is it can apply to a human on an individual basis, or a silkworm or a bee or a microbe. A microbe that has agency,\nor by virtue of a template. But it also applies to a community of organisms like the bees. And so we've done a lot of\nwork sort of moving from, you've asked how to grow things. So we've grown things using co-fabrication where we're digitally\nfabricating with other organisms that live across the\nvarious kingdoms of life. And those were silkworms and bees. And with bees, which\nwe've sent to outer space and returned healthily and\nthey were reproductive. - Okay, you're gonna\nhave to tell that story. (Neri laughs)\nYou're gonna have to talk about the robotic queen and\nthe pheromones, come on. All right.\n- So we've built what we called a synthetic apiary. And the synthetic apiary was\ndesigned as an environment that was a perpetual spring environment for the bees of Massachusetts. They go on hibernation, of\ncourse, during the winter season, and then we lose 80% of them\nor more during that period. We were thinking, okay, what if we created this\nenvironment where... Before you template, right\nbefore you can design with, you have to design for, right? You have to create this\nspace of mutualism, space of sort of shared connection between you and the organism. And with bees, it started\nas the synthetic apiary. And we have proven that\ncurated environment where we designed the space\nwith high levels of control, of temperature, humidity, and light. And we've proven that they\nwere reproductive and alive. And we realized, wow, this\nenvironment that we created can help augment bees in the winter season in any city around the world\nwhere bees survive and thrive in the summer and spring seasons. And could this be a kind\nof a new urban typology, an architectural typology\nof symbiosis of mutualism between organisms and humans? Where these, by the way, the synthetic apiary was in a co-op, you know, nearby Somerville\n- Mm-hmm. - We had, you know, we had\nrobots, our team, you know, schlepped there every day\nwith our tools and machines and we made it happen, and\nthe neighbors were very happy. And they got to get a ton of\nhoney at the end of the winter. And those bees, of course\nwere released into the wild at the end of the winter,\nalive and kicking. So then in order to actually experiment with the robotic queen,\nan idea, a concept, we had to prove obviously\nthat we can create this space for bees. And then after that we had\nthis amazing opportunity to send the bees to space\non Blue Shepherd mission that is part of Blue Origin. And we of course said,\nyes, we'll take a slot. We said, okay, can we outdo NASA? So NASA in 1982 had an experiment where they sent bees to outer space. The bees returned, they\nwere not reproductive, and some of them died. And we thought, well, is there a way in which we can create\na life support system, almost like a small mini-biolab\nof a queen and her retinue that would be sent in this Blue\nOrigin Blue Shepherd mission in this one cell. And so if the synthetic apiary\nwas an architectural project, in this case, this second\nsynthetic apiary was a product. It was, right, so from an architectural\ncontrolled environment to a product-scale controlled environment. And this biolab, this life\nsupport system for bees was designed to provide the bees with all the conditions that they needed, and we looked at that time\nat the Nasonov pheromone that the queen uses to\nguide the other bees, and we looked at pheromones\nthat are associated with a bee. And thinking of those\npheromones being released inside that capsule that\ngoes to outer space. They returned back to the media lab roof, and those bees were alive\nand kicking and reproductive, and, you know, and they\ncontinued to create comb. And it ended with a beautiful nature paper that the team and I published together. We gave them gold nanoparticles\nand silver nanoparticles because we were interested\nif bees recycle wax. It was known forever that\nbees do not recycle the wax. And by feeding them\nthese gold nanoparticles, we were able to prove that the bees actually do recycle the wax. The reason I'm bringing this forward is because we don't view\nourselves as designers of consumable products and\narchitectural environments only, but we love that moment\nwhere these technologies, and by the way, every one of\nthese projects that we created involved the creation of a new technology, whether it be a glass printer\nor the spinning robot, or the life support\nsystem for the bee colony. They all involved a technology that was associated with the project. And I never ever, ever, ever\nwant to let that part go. 'cause I love, love technology so much. But also another element of this is that always these\nprojects, if they're great, they reveal new knowledge about, or new science about the topic\nthat you're investigating, be it, you know, silkworms\nor bees or glass. That's why I say, I always tell\nmy team it should be at MoMA and the cover of Nature or\nScience at the same time, or we don't separate between\nthe art and the science. It's one of the same. - So as you're creating the art, you're going to learn\nsomething about these organisms"

      "text": "or something about these materials. I mean, is there something\nthat stands out to you about these hero organisms\nlike bees, silkworms? You mentioned E. coli has its\npros and cons, this bacteria. What have you learned, that small or big, that's interesting about these organisms? - Yeah, that's a beautiful question. What have I learned? I've learned that, you know, we also worked with shrimp\nshells, with Aguahoja. We built this tower on\nthe roof of the SFMOMA, which by a couple of months ago and until it was on the roof,\nwe've shown the structure completely biodegrade into\nthe, well not completely, but almost completely\nbiodegrade to the soil. And this notion that a product or part, an organism or part of that\norganism can reincarnate is very, very moving thought to me, because I want to believe that\nI believe in reincarnation. - I want to believe that I believe. - Yeah that's my relationship-\n- I want to believe. - With God, I like to\nbelieve in believing. Most great things in life are\nsecond derivatives of things. But (laughs) that's part\nof another conversation. - I feel like that's a quote\nthat's gonna take weeks to really internalize that. - That notion of I want you to want, or I need you to need, or that there's always something, a deeper truth behind\nwhat is on the surface. And so I like to go to the second and tertiary derivative of things and discover new truths\nabout them through that. But what have I learned about organisms? - And why don't you like E. coli? - I like E. Coli, and a lot\nof the work that we've done was not possible without\nour working on E. coli or other workhorse organisms,\nlike cyanobacteria. - How are bacteria used?\n- Death masks. (Lex laughs)\nThe death masks. - So what are death masks? - So we did this project called Vespers, and those were basically death masks that was set as a process for\ndesigning a living product. What happen, and I looked at, I remember looking at\nBeethoven's death mask and Agamemnon's death mask, and just studying how they were created. And really they were sort\nof geometrically attuned to the face of the dead. And what we wanted to do\nis create a death mask that was not based on the shape of the wearer, but rather was based on their\nlegacy and their biology. And maybe we could harness\na few stem cells there for future generations or\ncontain the last breath. Lazarus, which preceded Vespers, was a project where we designed a mask to contain a single breath,\na last breath of the wearer. And again, if I had access\nto these technologies today, I would totally reincorporate my grandmother's last breath in a product. So it was like an air memento. So with Vespers, we actually used E. coli to create pigmented masks. Masks whose pigments would be recreated at the surface of the mask. And I'm skipping over a lot of content, but basically there were 15 masks and they were created as three sets. The masks of the past,\nthe masks of the present and the mask of the future. The masks, there were five, five and five, and the masks of the past\nwere based on ornaments and they were embedded with\nnatural minerals, like gold. Yes, yes, yes.\n- And we're looking at pictures of these and are gorgeous. - Yes, yes.\n- Extremely delicate and interesting fractal\npatterns that are symmetrical. - They look symmetrical, but they're not. This is intent. We intended for you to be tricked and think that they're\nall symmetrical, but- - [Lex] There's imperfections. - There are imperfections by design. All of these forms and shapes and distribution of matter that you're looking at\nwas entirely designed using a computational program,\nso none of it is manual. But long story short, the first collection is about the surface of the mask. And the second collection,\nwhich you're looking at, is about the volume of the mask and what happens to the\nmask when all the colors from the surface, yes, enter\nthe volume of the mask inside, create pockets and channels\nto guide life through them. They were incorporated with pigment-producing living organisms. And then those organisms\nwere templated to recreate the patterns of the original death masks. And so life recycles and re-begins, and so on and so forth. The past meets the future.\nThe future meets the past. From the surface to the volume, from death to life, to death\nto life, to death to life. And that again, is a recurring theme in the projects that we take on. But there, from a\ntechnological perspective, what was interesting is that\nwe embedded chemical signals in the jet, in the printer,\nand those chemical signals basically interacted with the pigment-producing bacteria, in this case E. Coli, that were introduced on\nthe surface of the mask. And those interactions\nbetween the chemical signals inside the resins and the\nbacteria at the surface of the mask at the resolution\nthat is native to the printer, in this case 20 microns per voxel, allowed us to compute the exact patterns that we wanted to achieve. And we thought, wow, well if\nwe can do this with pigments, can we do this with antibiotics? If we can do this with antibiotics, could we do it with melanin? And what are the implications? Again, this is a platform technology. Now that we have it, what are the actual\nreal-world implications and potential applications\nfor this technology? And we started a new area\nof, one of my students, Rachel, her PhD thesis was titled after this new class of materials that we created through\nthis project, Vespers, \"Hybrid Living Materials,\" HLMs, and these hybrid living\nmaterials really paved the way towards a whole other set of\nproducts that we've designed, like the work that we did with melanin for the Mandela Pavilion\nthat we presented at SFMOMA, where again, we're using the\nsame principles of templating, in this case not silkworms and not bees, but we're templating bacteria at a much, much, much\nmore finer resolution. And now instead of\ntemplating using a robot, we're templating using a printer. But compute is very, very much part of it. And the what's nice about\nbacteria, of course, is that from an ethical perspective, I think there's a range, right? So at the end of the silk pavilion, I got an email from professor\nin Japan who has been working on transgenic silk and said, \"Well, if you did this\ngreat, amazing silk pavilion, why don't we create, you know, glow-in-the-light silk dresses?\" And in order to create this\nglow-in-the-light silk, we need to, you know, to apply genes that are taken from a\nspider to a silk worm. And this is what is known\nas a transgenic operation. And we said no. And that was for us, a\nclear decision that no, we will work with these organisms as long as we know that\nwhat we are doing with them is not only better for humans, but it's also better for them. And again, just to remind you, I forget the exact number, but it's around 1,000\ncocoons per single shirt that are exterminated in India and China, and in those sericulture\nindustries that are being abused. Now, yes, this organism was designed to serve the human species. And maybe we should, maybe it's time, you know, to retire that, you\nknow, that conception (laughs) of organisms that are designed\nfor a human-centric world or human-centric set of applications. I don't feel the same way about E. coli, not that I'm agnostic, organism agnostic. But still, I believe\nthere's so much for us to do on this planet with bacteria. - And so in general, your design principle is to grow cool stuff as a byproduct of the organism flourishing? So not using the organism.\n- Yes. - The win-win, the synergy.\n- Win-win. - A whole that's bigger\nthan the sum of its parts. - It's interesting. I mean, it just feels like a gray area where genetic modification of an organism, it just feels like, I don't know, if you genetically modified me to make me glow in the light, I kind of kind of like it.\n- I think you have enough of an aura. (laughs)\n- All right, thank you. I was just fishing for\ncompliments. Thank you. I appreciate it though.\n- But you're absolutely right. (Lex laughing)\nAnd by the way, the gray area is, you know, is\nwhere some of us like to live and like to thrive, and that's okay. And thank goodness that\nthere's so many of us that like the black and white and that thrive in the black and white. My husband is a good\nexample for that. (laughs) - But just to clarify, in this case, you are also trying to thrive\nin the black and white, in that you're saying like-\n- Yes. - The silk warm is a\nbeautiful, wonderful creature. Let us not modify it. Is that the idea? Or is it okay to modify a little bit as long as we can see that\nit benefits the organism as well as the final creation? - So with silkworms, absolutely, let's not modify it genetically.\n- Okay. - Let's not modify it\ngenetically, and then some. Because why did we get there\nto begin with 4,000 years ago in the Silk Road? And we should never get to\na point where we evolve life for the service of mankind at the risk of these wonderful creatures across the kingdoms,\nacross the kingdom of life. I don't think about the\nsame kind of ethical range when I think about bacteria. - Nevertheless, bacteria are\npretty wonderful organisms. - I'm moving to my\nsecond cup here. (laughs) - [Lex] Yes, take tea two. As things are getting serious now. - Bacteria are, yeah, for sure."

      "text": "- Let's give bacteria all\nthe love they deserve. We wouldn't be here without them. They were here for, I\ndon't know what it is, like a billion years before\nanything else showed up? - But in a way, if you think about it, they create the matter that we consume, and then reincarnate or\ndissolved into the soil, and then creates a tree, and then that tree creates more bacteria, and then that bacteria could... I mean, again, that's why I like to think about not recycling, but reincarnating, because that assumes a kind\nof imparting upon nature, that dimension of agency\nand maybe awareness. But yeah, lots of really interesting work happening with bacteria. Directed evolution is one of them. We're looking at directed evolution, so high-throughput directed evolution of bacteria for the\nproduction of products. And again, those products\ncan be a shoe, wearables, biomaterials, therapeutics. - And doing that\ndirection computationally? - Totally computationally, obviously, in the lab with the hero\norganism, the hero bacteria. And what's happening today in ecomicrobial synthetic biology, synthetic biology that\nlends itself to ecology, and again, all of these\nfields are coming together. It's such a wonderful\ntime to be a designer. I can't think of a better time to be a designer in this world, but with high-throughput\ndirected evolution, and I should say that the\nphysical space in our new lab will have these capsules,\nwhich we have designed. They're designed like growth\nchambers or grow rooms. And in those grow rooms,\nwe can basically program top-down environmental templating, or top-down environmental\ncontrol of lights, humidity, light, et cetera, sorry, light,\nhumidity and temperature, while doing bottom-up genetic regulation. So it is a wet lab, but in that wet lab, you could do at the same time, you know, genetic modulation, regulation\nand environmental templating. And then again, the idea is\nthat in one of those capsules, maybe we grow transparent wood and in another capsule we, you know, we transparent wood for\narchitectural application, another capsule, we grow a shoe. And in another capsule we look\nat that language, you know, large language model that\nwe talk talked about. And there's a particular\ntechnology associated with that, which we're hoping to reveal\nto the world in February. And each of those capsules is basically a high-throughput\ncomputational environment, like a breadboard that has, think of sort of a physical\nbreadboard environment that has access to oxygen\nand nitrogen and CO2 and nutritional dispensing. And these little capsules\ncould be stressed. They're sort of an ecology in a box, and they could be stressed to\nproduce the food of the future or the products of the future, or the construction\nmaterials of the future. Food is a very interesting one, obviously because of food insecurity and the issues that we have around both in terms of food insecurity, but also in terms of the future of food and what will remain after we can't eat plants and animals anymore, and all we can eat is these\nfalse bananas and, you know, and insects as our protein source. So there we're thinking, you know, can we design these capsules\nto stress an environment and see how that environment behaves? Think about a kind of an ecological, a biodiversity chamber, right? A kind of a time capsule\nthat is designed as a biodiversity chamber\nwhere you can program the exact temperature,\nhumidity, and light combination to emulate the environment from the past. So Ohio, 1981, December 31st\nat 5:00 AM in the morning, what did tomatoes taste like? To all the way in the\nfuture, 200 years ago? These are the environmental inputs. These are some genetic\nregulations that I'm testing and what might the food of the future or the products of the future or the construction\nmaterials of the future feel like, taste like,\nbehave, like, et cetera. And so these capsules are\ndesigned as part of a lab. That's why it's been\ntaking us such a long time to get to this point, because we started designing them in 2019, and they're currently,\nliterally as I speak to you, under construction.\n- How well is it understood how to do this dance of controlling these different variables\nin order for various kinds of growth to happen? - It's not. It's never been done before, and these capsules have\nnever been designed before. So you know, when we first decided these are going to be\nenvironmental capsules, people thought were crazy. \"What are you building?\nWhat are you making?\" So the answer is that we don't know, but we know that there has\nnever been a space like this where you have basically a wet lab and a grow room at that\nresolution, at that granularity of control over organisms. There is a reason why there\nis this incredible evolution of products in the software space. The hardware space, that's\na more limiting space, because of the physical\ninfrastructure that we have to test and experiment with things. So we really wanted to\npush on creating a wet lab that is novel in every possible way. What could you create in it?\nYou could create the future. You could create an environment of plants talking to each\nother with a robotic referee, and the robotic referee, you know, and you could set an objective\nfunction, and let's say for the transaction-driven\nindividuals in the world, let's say the objective function\nis carbon sequestration. And all of those plants are implemented with a gaming engine, and they have these reward system, right, and they're constantly\nneeding to optimize the way in which they carbon-sequest. We weed out the bad guys,\nwe leave the good guys, and we end up with this like ideal ecology of carbon-sequestering heroes that connect and\ncommunicate with each other. And once we have that model,\nthis biodiversity chamber, we send it out into the field, and we see what happens in nature. And that's sort of what I'm talking about, augmenting plants with\nthat extra dimension of bandwidth that they do not have. They're just, just last week I came across a paper that discusses the in vivo neurons that are augmented with a pong game, and in a dish they\nbasically present sentience and the beginning of awareness, which is wonderful.\n- Yeah. - Like that you could\nactually take these neurons from a mouse brain and you\nhave the electrical circuits and the physiological circuits\nthat enable these cells to connect and communicate and, together, arrive at sort of swarm\nsituation that allows them to act as a system that\nis not only perceived to be sentient, but is actually sentient. Michael Levin calls agential material, material that has agency, right? So this is of interest to us\nbecause this is sort of, again, this is emergence post-templating. You template until you don't\nneed to template anymore because the system has\nits own rules, right? What we don't want to happen with AGI we want to happen with synthetic biology. What we don't want to happen online and software with language,\nwe want for it to happen with bio-based materials, because that will get us\ncloser to growing things, as opposed to assembly\nand mechanically, yeah, putting them together with\ntoxic materials and compounds."

      "section": "Plant communication",
      "text": "- If I can ask a pothead\nquestion for a second. (Neri laughs)\nSo you mentioned, just like the silkworms,\nthe individualist silkworms got to actually learn how to collaborate. - Yes, yes, yes.\n- Or actually to collaborate, like in a swarm-like way. you're talking about getting\nplants to communicate in some interesting way based\non an objective function. Is it possible to have\nsome kind of interface between another kind of\norganisms, humans and nature? So like a human to have a\nconversation with a plant? - There already is. You know that when we\ncut freshly cut grass? I love the smell.\n- Mm-hmm. - But it's a smell of, actually, it's a smell of distress\nthat the leafs of grass are communicating to each other. So the grass, when it's cut, emits green leaf volatiles, GLVs, and those GLVs are\nbasically one leaf of grass communicating to another leaf of grass. Be careful, mind you,\nyou're about to be cut. (Lex laughs)\nThese incredible life forms are communicating using a\ndifferent language than ours. We use language models,\nthey use molecular models. At the moment where we can parse, we can decode these molecular moments is when we can start having\na conversation with plants. Now, of course there is a lot of work around plant neurobiology. It's a real thing. Plants do not have nervous system, but they have something\nakin to a nervous system. It has a kind of a ecological\nintelligence that is focused on a particular timescale,\nand the timescale is very, very slow, slow,\nslow, slow timescale. So it is when we can melt these timescales and connect with these plants in terms of the content of the language, in this case molecules, the\nduration of the language, and we can start having a conversation, if not simply to understand what is happening in the plant kingdom. Precision agriculture, I promise to you, will look very, very different, right? Because right now we're using\ndrones to take photos of crops of corn that look bad. And when we take that photo,\nit's already too late. But if we understand\nthese molecular footprints and things that they are trying to say, the stress that they are\ntrying to communicate, then we could of course\npredict the physiological, biological behavior of these crops, both for their own self perpetuation, but also for the foods and the pharma and the type of molecules\nthat we're seeking to grow for the benefit of humanity. And so these languages\nthat we are attempting now to quantify and qualify\nwill really help us not only better nature and help nature in its striving to surviving, but also help us, you\nknow, design better wines and, you know, and better\nfoods and better medicine and better products. Again, across all scales,\nacross all application domains. - Is there intricacies to\nunderstand the timescales, like you mentioned, at\nwhich these communications, these languages, like, operate? Is there something different between the way humans communicate and the way plants\ncommunicate in terms of time? - Remember when we\nstarted the conversation talking about sort of definitions\nin the context of design, and then in the context of being? That question requires, I think, a kind of shift, a humility. That requires a kind of a\nhumility towards nature, understanding that it\noperates on different scales. We recently discovered that, you know, that the molecular footprint of a rose, or of a plant in general, during nighttime is different than its molecular\nfootprint during daytime. So these are circadian\nrhythms that are associated with what kind of molecules these plants emit given\nstresses and given, you know, there's a\nreason why the jasmine, a jasmine field smells so delicious in 4:00 AM in the morning, and then there's like, there's\npeace and rest amongst, you know, amongst the plants. And you have to sort of tune\ninto that time dimension of the plant kingdom. And that of course\nrequires all this humility where in a single capsule to\ndesign a biodiversity chamber, it will take years, not months,\nand definitely not days. And to see these products, and\nalso that humility in design comes from simply, you know,\nlooking at how we are today as a civilization, how\nwe use and abuse nature. Like just think of all these\nChristmas trees, right? These Christmas trees,\nthey take years to grow. We use them for one night,\nthe holiest night of the year, and then we let them go and think about, in nature to design a,\nquote unquote, product. An organism spends energy and time and thoughtfulness in\nmany, many, many years, and I'm thinking about the\nredwoods, to grow these channels, these, you know, this cellulose layers and channels and reach\nthese incredible heights takes sometimes hundreds of years, sometimes thousands of years. Am I afraid of building a\ncompany that designs products in the scale of thousands of years? No, I'm not. And the way of being in\nthe physical world today is really not in tune\nwith a time dimension of the natural world at all. And that needs to change. And that's obviously very,\nvery hard to do in a community of human beings that is, at\nleast in the western world, that is based on capitalism. And so here, the wonderful challenge that we have ahead of us is how do we impart upon\nthe capitalist movement? We know that we need\nto produce now products that will enter the real\nworld and be, you know, shared and used by\nothers and still benefit the natural world while benefiting humans, and that's a wonderful challenge to have. - So integrate technology with nature, and that's a really difficult problem. I see parallels here with\nanother company of Neuralink, which is basically like,\nI think you mentioned, Neuralink for nature, that there are short-term\nproducts you can come up with, but it's ultimately a long-term challenge of how do you integrate the machine with this creation of\nnature, this intricate, complex creation of nature,\nwhich is the human brain? And then you're speaking\nmore generally nature. - You know how every company has an image. Like, this one single image that embodies the spirit of the company. - Mm-hmm.\n- And I think for Neuralink, it was to me that chimpanzee\nplaying a video game. - (laughs) Mm-hmm.\n- It was just unbelievable. But with plants, there potentially is a set of molecules that\nimpacts or inspires, I like that word, the plant to behave or act in a certain way\nand allows still the plant the possibility of deciding where it or she or he wants to go, which is why our first product\nfor this molecular space is going to be a functionalized fragrance. So here we're thinking about\nthe future of fragrances, and the future of fragrances\nand flavors, you know, these products are in the\nindustry as we know it today, are designed totally\nfor a human-centric use and an enjoyment, an\nindulgence and luxury. They're used on the body for the sake of, I dunno, attraction and\nfeeling good and smelling good. And we were asking\nourselves, is there a world in which a fragrance can be\nnot a functional fragrance? 'Cause you could claim that\nall fragrances are functional, but is there a world\nin which the fragrance becomes functionalized? Is, again, imparted upon or given agency to connect with another organism. Is there a world in which\nyou and I can go down to your garden and use a\nperfume that will interact with the rose garden downstairs? I've just been enamored\nwith the statements that are being made in the media around, oh, this is completely\nbiologically derived fragrance and it's bio-based, but when\nyou look into the fragrance and you understand that in order to get to this bio-derived fragrance, you went through, you\nblew through, you know, 10,000 bushes of rose to create five milliliters of a rose fragrance. And all these 10,000 bushes of rose, they take space, they take, you know, water management and so much waste. Is this really what we want\nthe future of our agriculture and molecular goods to look like? And so when we did Aguahoja\npavilion on the roof of SFMOMA We calculated that for that pavilion, we had 40,000 calories\nembedded into this pavilion that was made of shrimp shells\nand chitosan and apple skins and cellulose from tree pulp. And we calculated that overall, the structure had 40,000 calories. Interesting way to think\nabout a structure, right? From the point of view of calories. But as you left the gallery,\nyou saw these three clocks that were so beautifully\ndesigned by Felix on our team. And these clocks measured\ntemperature and humidity. And we are connected\nthem to weather channels so that we could directly\nlook at how the pavilion was biodegrading in real time. And in our calculations, I say\nthis long-winded description of the pavilion to say\nthat in the calculation, we incorporated, you know, how much electricity we\nused for our computers, for the 3D printers that\nprinted the pavilion. And, you know, and these were called\nemergy calculations, right? Energy and materials. And when you think about a product and you think about, you\nknow, a shoe or a chair or a perfume or a building,\nyou don't stop at the object. You want to go all the way to the system, again, instead of designing objects or singular embodiments of\nthe will of the designer, you're really tapping\ninto an entire system that is interconnected. And if you look at the energy budget that characterized the project Aguahoja, it traverses the entire planet, right? Some of these shrimp shells were brought from places in the world\nwe haven't thought of, in terms of the apples\nand the shrimp shells and the tree pulp. And so going back to, you\nknow, going back to fragrances, it's really, really important\nto understand the product in the context of the ecological system from which it's sourced\nin how it's designed. And that is the kind of thinking\nthat is not only desired, but is required if we\nare to achieve synergy between humanity and nature. - And it's interesting, 'cause the system level\nthinking is almost always gonna take you to the entire Earth, to considering the entire Earth ecosystem. - Which is why it's important\nto have a left brain and a right brain competing\nfor attention. (laughs) And intimacy. (laughs)\n- Sometimes in the same head. Yeah.\n- Yes. - You you mentioned a fragrance\nthat kind of sends out a message to the environment, essentially. - A message in a bottle. Yeah.\n- A message in a bottle. So like, so you can go to a rose garden and trick the rose garden to think it's 4:00 AM, essentially? - You could, if you wanted to, but maybe that is...\n- Not trick. Trick is such a bad word.\n- Right. Right. - Inspire. (laughs)\n- Inspire, I like. I like the idea of providing\nnature with a choice, which is why I love that\nelegant mathematical equation of empowerment and agency. - Empower the rose garden\nto create a romantic moment for the wearer of the fragrance. - But now again, all of\nthis to go back to back to that human-centric notion of romance, but maybe there's another\nway to do romance, right? That we haven't yet explored. And maybe, you know, there's\na way to tap into what happens to the rose when it's dreaming. Assuming that plants are sentient, and assuming that we can\ntap into that sentience, what can we discover about\nwhat does the rose want? Like what does it actually\nwant? And what does it need? And what are the rose's, you know, dreams? - But do you think\nthere's some correlation in terms of romance, in terms of the word you\nsometimes use, magic? Is there some similarities\nin what humans want and what roses want and what nature wants? - I think so. I think there is. And if I did not think so, oh my goodness, this would not be a nice world to live in. I think we all want love. (laughs)"

And the letter overall\nis imbued with a kind of a sense of remorse, or maybe even feelings of sadness. And there is some kind of\nmelancholy note in the letter where Einstein regrets not\nhaving spent enough time with his daughter, having\nfocused on, you know, the theory of general relativity\nand changing the world. And then he goes on to\ntalk about this beautiful and elegant equation of E = mc squared, and he tells his daughter\nthat he believes that love is actually the force\nthat shapes the universe because it is like gravity,\nright, it attracts people. It is like light. It brings people together\nand connects between people, and it's all-empowering. And so if you multiply\nit by the speed of light, you could really change\nthe world for the better.

It is a force that includes\nand governs all others, and is even behind any phenomena\noperating in the universe and has not yet been identified by us. This universal force is LOVE.\" He also, the last paragraph in the letter, as you've mentioned, \"I deeply regret not having been able to\nexpress what is in my heart, which has quietly beaten\nfor you all my life. Maybe it's too late to apologize, but as time is relative,\"\nthat jokester Einstein, \"I need to tell you that I love you, and thanks to you I have\nreached the ultimate answer. Your father, Albert Einstein.\" - Yeah.\n- But that regret, \"I deeply regret not having been able to express what is in my heart.\" Maybe that's a universal regret, of filling your days with busyness. - Yeah.\n- And silly pursuits and not sitting down and expressing that. - But it is everything. It is everything. It is why I love that expression. And I forget who said this,\nbut I love my daughter more than evolution required, right? And I feel the same way\ntowards my other half. And I feel that when you\nfind that connection, everything and anything is possible, and it's a very, very, very magical, a magical moment. So I believe in love,\nand I believe in the one."

You've created, through this intersection\nof engineering and nature, you have created some\nincredibly beautiful things. What do you think is beauty? - That's a beautiful question. (laughs) - (laughs) Maybe it is\nconnected to the love question. I don't know.\n- It is connected to the love question, of course. Everything is connected\nto the love question. - [Lex] (laughs) Okay. - To me, beauty is agency. To me, something that has\nagency, it is beautiful. There is this special quote\nfrom Buckminster Fuller, which I cannot remember word-for-word, but I remember the concept,\nwhich goes something like this, \"When I work on a problem,\nI never think about beauty. But when I'm done solving the problem and I look at what I've created, and it's not beautiful,\nI know that I was wrong.\" - (laughs) Okay. Yeah.\n- It is kind of an agency that speaks to, quote unquote, the objective function\nof the creation, right? Whether for Bucky, it's useless or useful. - So this idea of empowerment\nthat you talked about. - Yes.\n- It's fundamentally connected to it.\n- Comes back to that, yeah. - What's the difference that you hinted at between empowerment and emergence? Is emergence completely lacks control? Is it, and empowerment is more controlled? There's an agent making decisions? Is there an interesting distinction there? - Yes. I think empowerment is\na force with direction. It has directionality to it. Emergence is, I believe,\nmulti-directional. Again, that depends on the application. Emergence is perhaps, in terms of sort of a material definition, is a tropic spirit, when empowerment is, the\nend is a tropic counterpart. I think they overlap, because I think that empowerment is a way\nof inspiring emergence. I think emergence does not\nhappen without empowerment, but empowerment can\nhappen without emergence. - Do you think of emergence\nas the loss of control? Like when you're thinking\nabout these capsules and then the things they create, is emergence of things that\nis not a desirable conclusion? - I love that question\nbecause, to some of us, the loss of control is control. In design, we're used to like\nextreme levels of control over form and the shape of a thing and how it behaves and how it functions. And that's something we've inherited from the industrial revolution. But with nature, there's this diversity that happens without necessarily having\na reward function, right? This is good or bad. Things just happen. And some of them happen to have wings and some of them happen to have scales and, you know, you end up with this incredible\npotential for diversity. So I think the future of\ndesign is in that soft control, is in the ability to design\nhighly controlled systems that enable the loss of control. And creativity is very much part of this, because creativity is\nall about letting go, and beginning again, and beginning again, and beginning again. And when you cannot let\ngo, you cannot be creative, and you can't find novelty. But I think that letting go is a moment that enables empowerment,\nagency, creativity, emergence, and they're all connected. They're sort of associate\nthemselves with definition of destiny or the inevitable. A good friend of mine shared with me, elegant definition of fate, which is the ratio of who you\nare and who you want to be. - Ratio of who you are and\nwho you want to be. (laughs) - Exactly, and that sort\nof ends up defining you. - Yeah.\n- And those tools, I think, when you let\ngo, you sort of find, you give peace to your will,\nright, to a sense of will. And so I think that's very, very important in design, but also in life."

      "text": "- She said this: Fate is the ratio of-\n- Who you are, and who you want to be.\n- Who you want to be. Do you think there's something to this whole manifestation thing, like focusing on a vision of what you want the world to become, and in\nthat focusing you manifest it, like Paolo Coelho said in \"The Alchemist,\" \"When you want something,\nall the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it\"? Is there something to that?\n- I think so, yes. And I always think of, you\nknow, what I do as this, the culmination of energy,\ninformation and matter and how to direct energy,\ninformation and matter in the design of a thing\nor in the design of a life. I think living is very much\na process of channeling these energies to where they need to go. I think that the manifestation, or part of that manifestation, is the pointing to the moon\nin order to get to the moon. And that's why manifestation\nis also directional. It has that vector quality to\nit that I think of agency as. - Have you, in your own life, has there been things you've done where you kind of direct that\nenergy, information and matter in a way that opens up-\n- New possibilities? - Yeah. I mean, you've also said\nsomewhere, I'm probably misquoting, that you're many things, you, Neri are many things, and you become new things\nevery 10 years or so. - Oh, I did say that somewhere. - Somewhere.\n- That every decade you sort of switch.\n- That was an old, that was a previous Neri\nthat said that. (laughs) - Yeah, I did say\nsometime ago that you have to sort of reboot every 10 years to keep creative and keep\ninventive and keep fresh. - Is there things you've done in your life where just kinda doors opened? - I think everything, everything. Everything good I've found in my life has been found in that way of letting go and suspending my sense of disbelief. And often you will find\nme say to the team, \"Suspend your disbelief.\" I don't care that this is impossible. Let's assume it is. Where does it take us? And that suspension of disbelief is absolutely part and\nparcel of the creative act. You know, I did so when I was in medical school, I was in Hadassah and in\nthe Hebrew University, and I remember I left medical school for architecture the day\nmy grandmother passed away, and that was a moment of relief. And that was a door that was closing that opened other opportunities. But that of course required letting go of the great vision of becoming a doctor, and letting go of the dream\nof, you know, being surrounded by wonderful patients and\nthe science of medicine and the research associated\nwith that science, and letting go of that\ndream to accomplish another. And it has happened throughout\nmy life in different ways. MIT was another experience like that where people pointed at me as, you know, the designer for whom\nthe academic currency is not necessarily the citation index. And of course, in order\nto get tenure at MIT, you have to look at the citation index. But for me, it was not that,\nit was manifesting our work in shows and writing\npapers and writing patents and creating a celebration\naround the work. And I never saw a distinction, you know, between those ways of being. I also think that another\nkind of way of being or a modality of being\nthat I found helpful is Viktor Frankl wrote\nthis incredible book, \"Man's Search for Meaning\"\nafter the Holocaust. And he writes, \"Different people pursue\nlife for different reasons.\" According to Freud, the goal\nof life is to find pleasure, and according to Adler it's,\nyou know, to find power. And for Viktor Frankl, it was about finding meaning. And when you let go of the\ntitles and the disciplines and the boundaries and the\nexpectations and the perception, you are elevated to this really special, yes, spiritual, but definitely\nvery, very creative plane where you can sort of start anew, look at the world through\nthe lens of a bacterium or a robot, or you know, or look at ecology through\nthe lens of chemistry and look at chemistry\nthrough the lens of robotics, and look at robotics through\nthe lens of, you know, microbial ecologies,\nand so on and so forth. And I feel that kind of\nrebooting, not every 10 years, but every minute, every breath is very, very important\nfor a creative life and for just maintaining this fresh mind. To reboot, reboot, to begin again with every\nbreath, begin again. And that can be confusing for some, right? For my team members, you know,\nI like to change my mind. It's who I am. It's how I think, it's how I operate.\n(bell rings) - Mm-hmm.\n- Do you want to... (laughs) You know, and they'll come, and we found another technique or another technology that's interesting and we thought that, you know, that we were working on this\nfunctionalized fragrance, but now there's another\nopportunity and let's go there. To me, I would much rather,\nyou know, live life, like if I had to pick sort\nof my favorite Broadway show to enter and live through,\nit would be \"Into the Woods.\" It's not a specific fairytale. It's not, you know, the Sleeping Beauty or Little Red Riding Hood or Rapunzel. It's all of them. It's sort of moving into the forest and seeing this wonder and getting close and learning about that, and\nthen moving to another wonder. And life is really about tying all of these little fairytales together in work and also in life. - Unafraid to leap into the unknown? - Unafraid to leap into the unknown. - Speaking of MIT, you\ngot a tenure at MIT, and then you leaped (laughs) to New York and started a new company with a vision that doesn't\nspan a couple of years, but centuries. (laughs) - I did. It was my destiny to start a company. - Yeah.\n- And do I have mornings when I wake up and I ask myself,\nwhat the hell am I doing? - Yeah.\n- Yes. I have those mornings. - [Lex] What do you do with\nthose mornings, by the way? - I embrace them and I find gratitude, and I say to myself, \"Thank goodness. I'm so lucky to, you\nknow, to have the ability to be frustrated in this way.\"\n- Mm-hmm. (laughs) So I really, really\nembrace these frustrations. And I take them, I wrap them in a bubble, and I look at it, you know, on the outside of my aware mind, and I laugh at them. I smile at them. (laughs)\n(Lex laughs) - If I could return, actually\nto the question of beauty for a second, I forgot\nto ask you something. You mentioned imperfection\nin the death masks. - Mm-hmm. - What role does imperfection play in our conception of beauty? What role does imperfection\nplay in nature? There's this Japanese\naesthetics concept of wabi-sabi, which basically embraces imperfection. Nothing lasts, nothing is finished and nothing is perfect.\n- Yeah. - What do you think of that? - I totally agree that change\nis the only permanence. That imperfection is there, if only to signal that we are part of a bigger thing than ourselves, that we are on a journey, that things are in movement. And if they were perfect, of\ncourse when things are perfect, it is just so boring. We end up with stereotypes. And as humans, but I\nthink just in general, as living beings, we're\nhere to find meaning, and that meaning cannot be\nfind found without struggle and without seeking, not to perfect, but to build towards something better. When I was a child, my\nmother, who I love so much, always explained to me how\nimportant it is to fall and to fail and to fight and to argue, and that there is a way, that there's a culture to failing and to imperfection. So I think it is necessary for something beautiful to be imperfect. (Lex laughs) And it is a sign that\nit is a sign of nature, because nothing in nature is perfect."

      "section": "Flaws",
      "text": "- What about human relations?\nYou mentioned finding love. Are the flaws in humans,\nthe imperfection in humans, a component of love? Like what role do you\nthink the flaws play? - That's a really profound question. I think the flaws are there to, the flaws are there to\npresent a vulnerability. And those flaws are a sign of those vulnerabilities. And I think love is\nvery, very gentle, right? Love... With Bill, we often talk\nabout, between the two of us, about what drives all human behavior, and for him it's incentive, (laughs) as you might expect,\n(Lex laughs) and he will repeat this sentence to me, \"Oh, incentive drives all human behavior.\" - Mm-hmm.\n- But I would say, to me it's love, very much so, and I think flaws are part of that, because flaws are a sign\nof that vulnerability, whether physical, whether\nemotional vulnerability. And these vulnerabilities, they either tear us apart\nor they bring us together. The vulnerability is what is the glue. I think, I think that the\nvulnerability enables connection. The connection is the glue, and that connection enables\naccessing a higher ground as a community as opposed\nto as an individual. So if there is a society of the mind, or if there are higher levels of awareness that can be accessed in community, as opposed to, again,\ngoing to the silkworm, as opposed to on the individual level, I think that those occur through the flaws and the vulnerabilities. And without them, we cannot\nfind connection, community. And without community, we can't build what we have\nbuilt as a civilization, you know, for the past\nhundreds of thousands of years. So I think not only are they beautiful, but they have a functional\nrole in building civilizations. - Yeah. There's a sense in which\nlove requires vulnerability, and maybe love is the leap\ninto that vulnerability. - And I think yes, I think a flaw, think about it, like physically, I'm thinking about a brick\nthat's flawed, but in a way, I think of a flaw as an\nincreased surface area. (laughs) (Lex slaps) (Neri laughing)\n- That is a good line. That is a good line.\n- Right? A surface area that-\n- Hoo, that is a good line. - Like physically or emotionally, right? It sort of introduces\nthis whole new dimension to a human or a brick, and because you have more\nsurface area, you can- - Yeah. (laughs)\n- You know, use mortar, and build a home, and yeah,\nI think of it as accessing this additional dimension of surface area that could be used for good or bad, right? To connect, to communicate,\nto collaborate. It makes me think of that quote\nfrom this incredible movie I've watched years ago, \"Particle Fever,\" I think it was called. Documentary, about the\nLarge Hadron Collider, an incredible film where\nthey talk about the things that are least important for our survival are the things that make us human, like the pure romantic act\nor you know, the notion of... And Viktor Frankl talks about that, too. He talks about feeling the sun on his arms as he is working the soil in two degrees Fahrenheit without clothes. And the officer berates him and says, \"Well, what have you done? Have you been a businessman before you came here to the camp?\" And he says, \"I was a doctor.\" And he said, \"You must have made a lot\nof money as a doctor.\" And he said, \"All my\nwork I've done for free, I've been helping the poor.\" But he keeps his humility and he keeps his modesty, and he keeps his\npreservation of the spirit. And he says the things that\nactually make him able to, or made him able to outlive\nthe terrible experience in the Holocaust was the\nreally cherishing this moment when the sun hits his skin or when he can eat a grain of rice, a single grain of rice. So I think cherishing\nis a very important part of living a meaningful life, being able to cherish those simple things. - Like to notice them and to-\n- To notice them, to pay attention to them in the moment. And I do this now more than ever. - I mean, there is some, Bukowski has this poem\nlike called \"Nirvana,\" where it tells a story\nof a young man on a bus going through like North\nCarolina or something like this, and they stop off in a\ncafe and he has this, there's a waitress and just, he talks about that he notices the magic, something indescribable,\njust notices the magic of it. And he gets back on the bus\nwith the rest of the passengers. And none of them seem to\nhave noticed the magic. And I think if you just\nallow yourself to pause and just to feel whatever that is, maybe ultimately it's a kind of gratitude. - Yes.\n- For... I don't know what it is. It's just, I'm sure it's\njust chemicals in the brain, but it is just so incredible to be alive. - Yes.\n- And noticing that. - Yes.\n- And appreciating that, and being one in that with others. - Yes. Yes. And that goes back to, you know, to the fireplace, right,\nto the first technology. What was the first\ntechnology? It was fire. First technology to have built community. And it emerged out of a vulnerability, of wanting to stay away from\nthe cold and be warm together. And, of course, that\nfire is associated with, not only with comfort and the\nability to form, you know, bio-relevant nutrients in our food and provide heat and\ncomfort, but also spirits and a kind of a way to enter a, you know, to enter a spiritual moment, to enter a moment that\ncan only be experienced in a community, as a form\nof a meditative moment. There is a lot to be said about light. Light is, I think, an important part of these moments of... I think it's a real thing. I really truly believe that we're born with an aura surface\narea that is measurable. I think we're born into the world with an aura. And how do we channel that is really, sort of, I mean, ends up sort of defining, you know, defining the light in our lives. - Do you think we're all lonely? Do you think there's\nloneliness in us humans? - Oh yes, yes. Loneliness is part, yes. I think we all have that loneliness, whether we're willing to\naccess that loneliness and look at it in the eye, or completely, you know, completely avoid it or deny it. - It's like, it feels like it's this some kind of foundation for longing, and longing leads to this combination of vulnerability and\nconnection with others. - Yes.\n- And it feels like that's a really important\npart of being human, is being lonely.\n- Very. We are born into this world alone. Again, being alone and being lonely are two different things, right? And you can be together, but be lonely, and you can be alone,\nbut not be lonely at all. We often joke, Bill and I,\nthat he cannot be lonely. He cannot deal with being by himself. He always needs people around him, and I strive, long, must have creative solitude, must find pockets of\nsolitude and loneliness in order to find creativity\nand reconnect with myself. So loneliness is a recipe\nfor community, in my opinion. And I think those things\ncompliment each other. And they're synergetic, absolutely. The yin and yang of togetherness. And they allow you, I think, yeah, to reset and to tune in to that ratio we talked about, of who you are and who you want to be. - If you go to this place\nof creative solitude, what's your creative process? Is there something you've\nnoticed about what you do that leads to your, to good work? - I love to be able,\nnot only to lose focus, but kind of to focus\non the peripheral view, and to allow different\nthings to occur at once. So I will often, in my\nloneliness journeys, I will often listen to\nlike Leonard Bernstein, anything I can find\nonline by Lenny Bernstein. It's reading a Nature\npaper, it's \"War and Peace.\" It's really revisiting all the texts that are so timeless for me with opportunities that\nare very, very timely. And I think for me, the\ncreative process is really about bringing timeless\nproblems or concepts together with timely technologies, to observe them. I remember when we did\nthe Mandela Pavilion, we read \"Moby Dick,\" the whiteness of the whale, the albino, the different, the other. And that got us to work on melanin. And melanin also is sort of\nan output from the death mask. So it's lots of things\nhappening at the same time. And really allowing them,\nallowing them to come together to form this view about\nthe world through the lens of a spirit being, or a\nliving being, or a material, and then focus on the world through the lens of that material. The glasswork was another\nproject like that, where we were fascinated by glass, because obviously it's superb\nmaterial for architecture. But we created this new\nglass printing technology for the first time that was shedding light on the biomechanics of fluid glass, the math and the physics of\nwhich was never done before, which was so exciting to us,\nbut revealing new knowledge about the world through\ntechnology, that's one theme. The reincarnation between\nthings, material and immaterial, that's another theme. Lenny Bernstein, \"War and Peace,\" Tolstoy. - You tweeted a Tolstoy\nquote from \"War and Peace,\" as of course you would: \"Everything I know, I\nknow because of love.\" - Love, yeah. I love this quote. - So you use these kind of inspirations to focus you and then find the\nactual idea in the periphery? - Yes, and then connect them with whatever it is that we're working on. Whether it's, you know, high-throughput directed\nevolution of bacteria, you know, whether it's, you know, recreating that Garden\nof Eden in the capsule and what it looks like,\nthe food of the future. It is a little bit like directing a film, creating a new project is a bit like creating a film. And you have these heroes, you have these characters\nand you put them together, and there is a narrative,\nand there's a story. Whenever we start a new\nproject, it has to have these ingredients of\nsimultaneous complexity. It has to be novel in terms\nof the synthetic biology, material science, robotics, engineering, all of these elements that are discipline-based\nor rooted must be novel. If you can combine novelty\nin synthetic biology with a novelty in robotics, with a novelty in material science, with a novelty in computational design, you are bound to create\nsomething novel, period. And that's how I run the company, and that's how I pick the people. And so that's another very,\nvery important ingredient of the cutting edge across\nmultiple disciplines that come together. And then in the background,\nin the periphery, there's all these messages, the whispers of the ancient oldies, right? The Beethoven's and the Picassos and- - So Beethoven's always whispering to you? - Yeah.\n(Lex laughs) How could one not include\nBeethoven in the whispers? - I'm gonna ask you about\nBeethoven and the Evgeny Kissin that you've mentioned, 'cause I've played piano my whole life. I obviously know a lot of Beethoven, and it's one of the private\nthings for me, I suppose, 'cause I don't think I've\never publicly played piano. - By the way, me too.\n(both laugh) - I mean that-\n- I play in private only. (Neri laughs)\n- Yeah, people sometimes, even with guitar, people ask me, \"Well, can you play something?\" And it just feels like certain things are- - Are meant to be done-\n- Privately. - Yeah.\n- It's weird. I mean it's a difficult... and some of the times I\nhave performed publicly, it is it ultimate leap in vulnerability. It's very, very, very difficult, for me. And I'm sure it's, I know\nit's not for a lot of people, but it is for me. Anyway, we'll return to that, but since you've mentioned\ncombination of novelty across multiple disciplines\nand that's what you seek when you build teams or pick people you work with.\n- Yeah. Yeah. - I just wanted to kind\nof linger on this idea of (laughs) what kind of\nhumans are you looking for in this endeavor that you're taking on, this fascinating thing that\nyou've been talking about? One of the things somewhere\nelse, a previous version, version 5.7 of Neri said somewhere that there's four fields\nthat are combined to create this intersection of\nbiology and engineering work and it's computational design,\nadditive manufacturing, material engineering, synthetic biology. I'm sure there's others, but\nhow do you find these humans? Machine learning's in the mix? - I manifest and they come.\n- Yeah? - There are a few approaches.\n- You manifest? (laughs) - (laughs) They show up.\n- Okay. - You know, send your\nmessage upon the water. I mean, those job\ndescriptions that you saw, the first ones I wrote by myself, and you find interesting people and brilliant people when you look, we talked about second derivative. When you look under and under and under. And if you look deep enough\nand specialized enough, and if you allow yourself to look at the cracks, at the flaws, at the cracks between disciplines and between skills, you find really, really\ninteresting diamonds in the rough. And so I like for those\njob descriptions to, yeah, to be those messages in a bottle that bring those really\ninteresting people our way. I mean, they have to have humility. They have to have a shine in their eye. They have to be hungry and foolish. As Jobs so famously said, a friend of mine who's a dean of well-known\narchitectural school said, you know, \"Today architects\ndon't wanna be architects. Architects don't look up to the starchitects as role models. Starchitects are no longer role models. Architects want to build by\nvirtue of not building,\" right? Architects want, she said, \"We're back in the 60s when\nwe think about architecture, back in the hippie movement.\" I think that, in a way, they have to be somewhat of a hippie, somewhat of a kind of\njack-of-all-trades, master of all. - And yet with humility.\n- And yet with humility. Now, that is hard to find. And that is why, you know,\nwhen I start an interview, I talk about childhood memories, and I ask about music and\nI ask about connection. And through these interviews you can learn a lot about a person's\nfuture by spending time hearing them talk about their past. - Do you find that educational,\nlike PhDs versus... Like what's the life trajectory? Yours is an interesting life\ntrajectory, too. (laughs) Like what's the life trajectory that leads to the kind of person\nthat would work with you? - It's, you know, people who have, ideally had industry experience\nand know what it's like to be in the, quote unquote, real world. They're dreamers that\nare addicted to reality, as opposed to realists that\nare addicted to dreams. Meaning they have that innocence in them. They have the hunger. They have the idealism without being entitled and with understanding the\nsystems that govern our world and understanding how\nto utilize these systems as Trojan horses to bring\nthose values into the world. There are individuals who feel comfortable in this friction between, you know, highly wondrous and dreamy and incredible fantasy renditions\nof what the world could be with extremely brilliant skills in terms of their disciplinary background. So PhD with industrial\nexperience in a certain field, or a double major in two fields that make no sense whatsoever in their combination.\n- I love it. Yeah. - Are things that really,\nreally attract me. - And especially that span this, the technology biology gap.\n- Yes. The technology, biology, nature, culture. I mean, the secret to one thing is through the lens of\nanother, and I always believe in that kind of\ntranslational design ability, to be able to see something\nthrough the lens of another and always allows you to\nthink again, begin again, reestablish, redefine, suspend\nyour disbelief, revisit. And when you revisit enough\ntimes, like 100 times or like 200 times, and you\nrevisit the same question through the lens of\nany possible discipline and any possible scenario you find, eventually you get to the truth."

      "section": "Extinction",
      "text": "- I have to ask you, because\nyou work at the interplay of the machine and the natural world. Is there a good definition\nfor you of what is life? What is a living organism?\n- Mm-hmm. I think like 440 million years ago, there were all these plants. That the cyanobacteria,\nI believe, actually, that was like the first extinction, right? There were six five extinctions. We are apparently the sixth, that we are in the eye of the storm, we are in the sixth extinction. We are going to be extinct as we speak. I mean, death is upon us, whether we want to admit it or not. And actually they found in\nArgentina and in, you know, various places around the world, they found these spores\nof the first plants that existed on the planet, and they emerged out of these\ncyanobacteria were the first, of course, and then they found\nthese spore-based plants. And because they didn't have\nseeds there, only spores, the spores became sort of the fossils by which we've come to\nknown of their existence. And because of these spores, we know that this first\nextinction existed. But this extinction is actually what enabled\nplants to redirect, right? So the death of these first plants, because they clinged to the rocks and they generated a ton of phosphorus that went into the ocean\nby clinging to the rocks, like 60 times more\nphosphorus than without them. And then all this pho phosphorus\nbasically choked the oceans and made them super cold\nand without oxygen, anoxic, and then we lost the plant kingdom. And then because of the\ndeath of these first plants, they actually enriched the soil and created nutrients for these new plants to come to the planet. And those plants had, like,\nmore sophisticated vein systems, and they were moving beyond\nspores to seeded plants, et cetera, and flowering plants. And so in a way, one mass\nextinction sort of led, in the Ordovician period sort\nof led to life as we know it. And where would we be\nwithout plants, in a way? So I think that death is\nvery much part of life, and through that definition, that kind of planetary-wide definition in the context of hundreds\nof millions of years, life gains a completely\nnew sort of a new light. And that's when the particles\nbecome a wave, right? Where humans are, we are not alone, and we are here because\nof those plants, right? So I think death is\nvery much part of life. So in the context of, you know,\nthe redwood tree, perhaps, you know, life is defined\nas 10 generations, and through the lens of a bacteria, perhaps life is defined as a millisecond, and perhaps through the lens of an AGI, life is defined as all\nof human civilization. And so I think it really is a question of this timescale again, the timescale and the organism, the life form that's asking the question through which we can answer, what is life? - What do you think about this? Since, if we think of ourselves\nas in the eye of the storm of an another extinction, the natural question to ask\nhere is you have all of nature, and then you have this new human creation that is currently being termed\nartificial intelligence. How does your work play\nwith the possibility of a future super-intelligent\necosystem and AGI, that either joins or supersedes humans. - Yeah, so I'm glad you\nasked this question. - And are you hopeful or terrified? - Both. I'm hopeful and terrified. I did watch your interview\nwith Eliezer Yudkowsky, and I loved it. - Because you were scared? Or because you were excited? Or because there was a\n(drowned out by Neri) - First of all, I was both. I was totally scared, ashamed, excited, and totally also inspired, because he's just such\nan incredible thinker. And I can agree or\ndisagree with what he says, but I just found his way\nof thinking about AGI and the perils of humanity as a result. - There's an inevitability\nto what he's saying. His advice to young people is\nthat prepare for a short life. - Yeah.\n- He thinks it's very almost simple. It's almost common sense that\nAGI would get rid of humans, that he can't imagine\na trajectory eventually that leads to a place that\ndoesn't have AGI kill all humans. There's just too many trajectories where superintelligent\nsystems gets rid of humans, and in the near term.\n- Yeah. - And so that clarity of\nthinking is very sobering. To me, maybe it is to you as\nwell, it's super inspiring. 'cause I think he's wrong, but it's like you almost\nwanna prove him wrong. It's like, no, we humans\nare a clever bunch. We're gonna find a way.\n- It is a bit like jumping into super cold water. It's sort of a kind of\na fist in your face. It wakes you up.\n- Yeah. Yeah. - And I like these moments so much. - Yes, yes, yes.\n- And he was able to bring that moment to\nlife, even though, I think, a mother can never think that way. Ever.\n- Yeah. - And it's a little bit\nlike that notion of, I love her more than evolution requires. On your question about AGI and nature, look, I think we've been\nthrough a lot in terms of, to get here, we sort of\nmoved from data, right? The ability to collect\ninformation to knowledge, the ability to use this\ninformation for utility, from knowledge to intelligence. And what is intelligence? It's the ability to problem\nsolve and adapt and translate. So that sort of from data\nto information to knowledge. I think the next frontier is wisdom. And what is wisdom? Wisdom is the ability\nto have or find insight about the world, and from wisdom to spiritual awareness, which is sort of transcends wisdom and is able and to chart the\nworld into new territory. But I think what is interesting about AGI is that it is sort of almost like a self-recursive thing, right? Because it's like a washing machine of like a third derivative Wikipedia. It uses kind of like\nlanguage to create language, to create language, to create language. - It feels like novelty's\nbeing constantly created. It doesn't feel like it's regurgitating. - And that's so fascinating\nbecause, you know, these are not the stochastic parrots. This is sort of a new form\nof emergence, perhaps, of novelty as you say,\nthat exist by virtue of using old things to create new things. But it's not as if the AGI\nhas self-awareness, right? It's not as if it has,\nmaybe, maybe, maybe. Maybe it has. But as far as I can tell, it's not as if AGI has\napproached consciousness or sentience just yet. It's probably getting there, but the language appears to present itself as if there is sentience\nthere, but it doesn't. But I think that's the problem. At the point where this\nAGI sounds like me, and speaks like me, and behaves like me, and feels like me, and breathes like me, and my\ndaughter knows the AGI to be me as sort of the end of everything, right, is the end of human agency. But what is the end of\nhuman agency to humans, I think, is the beginning\nof agency to nature. Because if you take all of this agency, if you take all of these language models that can summarize all\nof human civilization and consciousness and then\nupload that to nature, and have nature now deal with\nthat world of consciousness that it never had access to. So maybe through Eliezer's lens, the sort of short-lived human becomes sort of a very\nlong-lived human-like, sentient weeping willow, maybe?\n- Yeah. - Maybe that's the end and the beginning? And maybe on the more optimistic side, for us humans, it's a\ndifferent form of existence, where everything we create\nand everything we consume and everything we process is all made out of six, you know, six elements and that's it. And there's only those six\nelements, and not 118 elements. And it's all the stuff\nof biology plus some, you know, fair amount of bits, bits, genes and atoms. - Well, I think the idea-\n- A lot of Beethoven. - A lot of Beethoven.\n(Neri laughs) I think the idea of\nconnecting AGI to nature through your work is really fascinating. Sort of unlocking this\nincredible machinery of intelligence, that is AGI, and connecting it to the incredible machinery\nof wisdom, that is nature, as evolved through billions of years of pretty crazy intense evolution. - Exactly, and unlike sort of, again, I'm going back\nto directed evolution, unlike this sort of high-throughput,\nbrute-force approach, if there is a way to utilize this synergy for diversity and diversification, like yeah. Like, what happens if you ask a ChatGPT question and it takes 10,000 years\nto answer that question? Like, what does that look like, right, when you like completely\nswitch the timescale and you can afford the time\nto answer the question. And again, I don't know, but that world, to me, is possibly amazing."

(laughs) Because when we start to think\nabout timescales like this, just looking at Earth, all\nthe possible trajectories it might take of this living\norganism that is Earth. Do you think there's others like it? Do you think there's other-\n- Planets. - Planets with life forms on them that are just doing their thing in this kind of way? 'Cause in what you're doing, you're directly playing with what's possible with\nlife, lifelike things. That kind of maps the question of, well, what kind of other\nthings are possible elsewhere? Do you think there's\nother worlds full of life, full of alien life out there? - I've studied the calculations\nthat point, you know, towards the verdict that\nthe possibility of life in, you know, in and around\nus is very, very low. We are a chosen planet in a way, right? There's water and there's\nlove. What else do you need? (both laugh) And that sort of (laughs) very peculiar juxtaposition of conditions,\nthe oxygen, the water, the carbon, again, is in a way, a miracle given the massive extinctions that we've been through as life forms. And that said, I cannot believe that there is no other life form. I want to believe more than I know that, yes, that there are\nlife forms in, you know, in the white fountain\nthat is the black hole, (laughs) right?\n(Lex laughs) That there are these life\nforms that are, you know, light years away from us that are forming other forms of life forces. - I'm much more worried about, probably the thing that you're working on, which is that there's all\nkinds of life around us that we're not communicating with. - Yes.\n- So there's aliens, in a sense, all around\nus that we're not seeing, that we're not talking to,\nthat we're not communicating. - Yeah.\n- Because that to me just seems the more likely situation. - That they're here.\n- That they're here, they're all around us.\n- Yeah. In different forms. That there is a connection, like, there's a thing that connects all of us, all of living beings across the universe, and like we're just beginning\nto understand any of it. - Yeah.\n- And I feel like that's the important\nproblem, is I feel like you can get there with\nthe tools of science today by just studying life on Earth. Unlock some really fundamental things that maybe you can start\nto answer questions about what is consciousness? Maybe this thing that we've\nbeen saying about love, but in, honestly in a serious way, and then you'll start to understand that there is alien life all out there, and it's much more\ncomplicated and interesting than we kind of realize.\n- Yeah. - As opposed to look into human-like, exactly human-like things. It's the variety of life that's possible. It's just almost endless.\n- I totally agree with you. I think again, define\nalien, right? (laughs) - (laughs) Yeah. Define\nintelligence, define life. - Right. And Marvin Minsky used to say, \"Intelligence is a suitcase word,\" right? It's a word so big, it's a\nword like sustainability, and it's a word like,\nyou know, rock and roll, and suitcase words are\nalways very, very dangerous."

I always wondered why\nis it that plastic arts, meaning architecture and\nsculpture and painting, can't get us to cry and music\ngets us to cry so quickly and connect so quickly? There is something about music that it is, and no wonder that plants\nalso respond to music, but that is the top of the\ncreative pyramid in my opinion. - And it's a weird mystery that\nwe're so connected to music. Well, by the way, to push back, a good bridge will make me cry. - A good arch. It's true.\n(Lex laughs) And I will say when I\nvisited the Sagrada Familia, I had that kind of spiritual reverence towards that spatial experience\nand being in that space and feeling the intention in the space, and appreciating every little gesture.

Francis Coppola is one of my heroes. - Have you met him?\n- I have met him. Yes, yes, yes. I was very, very lucky. We were very lucky to work\nwith him on his new film, \"Megalopolis,\" which is\ncoming out, I hope, in 2024. And think about the cities of the future in the context of new materials and the unity between nature and culture. Godfather is definitely up\nthere, \"2001\" is up there. I would watch that film\nagain and again and again. It's incredible. The last scene in Odyssey 2001, that's, just watch the\nlast scene of \"2001,\" then listen to (indistinct)\nand then sort of, and then go the garden,\nand that's pretty much, you know, the end in the beginning. But that scene, that last\nscene from 2001 is everything. It says so much with so\nlittle, and it leaves... It's sort of the embodiment\nI believe, of ambivalence, and there's opportunity to believe in the beginning of humankind,\nthe end of humankind, the planet's child star or\nstar child of the future. Was there a death? Was\nthere an reincarnation? You know, that final scene, to me, is something that I go back to and study. And every time there\nis a different reading of that scene that inspires me. So that scene just... And then the first scene\nin \"The Godfather,\" still one of the best scenes of all times. Sort of a portrait of\nAmerica, the ideals and values that are brought from Italy and- - A family of loyalty of-\n- Yes. - Of values, of how different\nvalues are constructed? - Yes, loyalty, and the human spirit. And how Coppola celebrates\nthe human spirit through the most simple\ngestures in language and acting. And I think in Kubrick you\nsee this highly curated and controlled and manicured vision of creating a film. And with Francis, it's\nlike an Italian feast. (Lex laughs)\nJust like anything. - Yeah.\n- Anything can happen at any moment in time, and\njust being on the set with him is an experience I'll take\nwith me (laughs) to my grave. It's very, very, very special. - And you said music is also part of that, of creating a feeling in the movies? - Yeah, actually \"The Godfather,\" (sings) that tune.\n- Yeah. That makes me like emotional every time on some weird level.\n- Yeah. It's one of these tunes, I'm\nsure, that has, you know, if you play it to a jasmine, you'll get the best scent of all time. (Lex laughs)\nI think, like, there's, but I think with that particular\ntune I learned staccato. (Neri sings) Something very, very happy and joyous. (Neri sings) And then made into this stretched in time and became kind of the refrain of nostalgia and melancholy and loyalty and all of these values that ride on top of this one single tune. - You can play in all\nkinds of different ways. I've played it on guitar in\nall kinds of different ways. And I think in \"Godfather III,\" the son plays it on guitar to the father. I think this happens in\nmovies, but sometimes a melody, and that's a simple\nmelody can just like... - And the Strauss melody in \"2001.\" - Yeah.\n- And when you juxtapose these melodies with the scene, you get this, again, whole that's bigger than\nthe sum of its parts, where you get this\nmoment that is, I think, like these are the moments I would send, you know, with the next\nVoyager to outer space. I definitely sent The\nGodfather\" and \"2001\" would definitely be be\non that Golden Record."

Can you give advice to young\npeople listening to this, how to have a successful career and how to have a successful life? - Look, I think there's\nthis beautiful line in \"Sheltering Sky.\" How many times have you seen a full moon in your life and actually took the time to ingest (laughs) and explore and reflect upon the full moon? Probably 20, I believe he says. I spend time with a full moon. I take my time with a full moon, and I pay attention to a full moon. And I think paying attention to the seasons, and taking time to appreciate the little things, the simple things is what\nmakes a meaningful life. I was very lucky to have had, you know, to have grown up in a home that taught me this way of being. My parents, my grandmother, who played a very important\nrole in my growing up, and that ability to pay attention and to be present is so, so, so, so, I could not emphasize it\nenough, is so crucial. - And be grateful.\n- And be grateful. - Yeah.\n- I think gratitude and presence, appreciation, are really the most important things in life. - If you could take a short\ntangent about your grandmother, who's played a big role in your\nlife, what do you remember? What lessons have you learned from her? - She had this blanket\nthat she would give me every time I came back from\nschool and say, you know, do your homework here and\nmeet with your friends here, and it was always in her garden. And her garden in my mind was ginormous, but when I, you know, last I\nwent there and saw the site, which has now become the site\nfor another tall building. It was a tiny, tiny little garden that, to me, seemed so\nlarge when I was growing up, because it had everything. It had fig trees. it had olive trees. It had mushrooms. It had the blanket. I would do my homework there. It was everything, and\nI needed nothing else. And that was my Garden of Eden.\nThat was my childhood being. And she taught me, you know, we would lie on the blanket\nand look at the clouds and reflect upon the shapes of the clouds and study the shapes of the plants, and there was a lot of wonder\nin that childhood with her. And she taught me the importance of wonder in sort of in an eternal childhood and living adulthood as a child. And so I'm very, very grateful for that. I think it is the sense of wonder. The speaking up was always\nsomething that she adhered to, to speak up your truth, to be straightforward, to be positive. These are things that\nI also got from my mom. And from my mom, the sense of humor. She had the best sense of humor that I could think of and was just, just a joy to be around, and\nmy father taught me everything. My father taught me everything I know. My mom taught me\neverything I feel. (laughs) - [Lex] (laughs) That's\na good way to put it. - My grandma taught me\neverything I insight. - Well, I see the sense of wonder that just carries through\neverything you do. So I think you would, you\nmake your grandmother proud. Well, what about advice\nfor how to have a career? So you've had a very interesting career and a successful career,\nbut not an easy one. You took a few leaps. - I did take a few leaps,\nand they were uncomfortable. My father, and I'll never forget, (laughs) I think we were like listening to a Rolling\nStones song in the kitchen, and my dad, who was actually\nborn in Boston, he's American, he said... I started to have sort\nof these second thoughts about continuing my education in Israel, and I wanted to, you know,\ngo, I was on my way to London, to the Architectural Association to do my diploma studies there. And he looked at me and he\nsaid, \"Get out of here kiddo. You gotta get out of here.\" And you know, \"You've\noutgrown where you're at. You know, you need to move forward.\" Another thing he had taught\nme, the feeling of discomfort, as you, as you say, the feeling\nof loneliness and discomfort is imperative to growth. Growth is painful, period. Any form of growth is\ndifficult and painful. Birth is difficult and painful. And it is really, really\nimportant to place yourself in situations of discomfort. I like to be in a room\nwhere everyone in the room is more intelligent than me. I like to be in that kind of state where the people that\nI surround myself with are orders of magnitude\nmore intelligent than I am, and I can say that is true\nof all of my team members. And that's the intellectual\ndiscomfort that I feed off of. The same is true for physical exertion. You gotta put yourself in\nthese uncomfortable situations in order to grow, in\norder to find comfort. And then on the other hand is love, is finding love, and finding that, you know, that human, this\nother human that complements you and that makes you a better version of the one you are, and even of the one you want to be. But with gratitude and attention and love, you can go so far. To the younger generation,\nI don't speak of a career. I never thought of my\nwork as my career, ever. And there was this constant entanglement between life and work and love and longing and being and mothering. It's all the same. And I appreciate that to\nsome people that doesn't work you know, in their arrangement of will versus comfort versus the reality. But for me, it has always worked. So I think to the younger generation, I say, don't think of your career. A career is something\nthat is imposed upon you. Think of your calling. That's something that's innately and directionally moves you. And it's something that\ntranscends a career. Similarly, you can think\nabout the difference between, you know, learning versus being educated. Being educated is something\nthat's given to you, that's external, that's being imposed, that's top-down imposed. This learning is something\nthat comes from within. It's also the difference\nbetween joy and happiness. Many times I'm sad and I'm still joyous. And it's very, very important\nto understand the difference between these externally\nperceived success paths and internally driven, value-based, you know, ways of being in the world. And we together, when\nwe combine all of these, you know, all of these,\nthe broken puzzle, (laughs) let's say of substance and vulnerability, we get this bigger gestalt, this wondrous world of a future that is peaceful, you know, that is wholesome\nand that, you know, that proposes or, you know, advocates for that kind of synergy that we've been talking about throughout. But it's all fun. (laughs)\n(Lex laughs) - Well, thank you for this\nincredible conversation. Thank you for all the work you're doing. - Thank you, Lex.\n- And I just have to say that thank you for noticing\nme and listening to me. You're somebody from just today and from our exchanges before this. Like, there's a sense where you care about me as a human being, which I could tell you\ncare about other humans. Thank you for doing that. Thank you for having\nempathy and just like, yeah, really listening and\nnoticing me, that I exist. So thank you for that. Been a huge fan of your work, been a huge fan of who\nyou are as a human being. It's just an honor that\nyou would sit with me. Thank you.\n- Thank you so much, Lex. I feel the same way.\nI'll just say the same. - And I look forward to hearing the response to my job\napplication I've submitted. (Lex laughs)\n- Oh, you're accepted. - Oh, damn, all right.

  "full_text": "- Whenever we start a new project, it has to have these ingredients\nof simultaneous complexity. It has to be novel in terms\nof the synthetic biology, material science, robotics, engineering. All of these elements that are discipline-based\nor rooted must be novel. If you can combine novelty\nin synthetic biology with a novelty in robotics, with a novelty in material science, with a novelty in computational design, you are bound to create something novel. (curtain whooshes) - The following is a\nconversation with Neri Oxman, an engineer, scientist,\ndesigner, architect, artist, and one of the kindest, most thoughtful, and brilliant human beings\nI've ever gotten to know. For a long time, she led the Mediated Matter\nGroup at MIT that did research and built incredible\nstuff at the intersection of computational design,\ndigital fabrication, material science, and synthetic biology, doing so at all scales, from the micro scale\nto the building scale. Now, she's continuing this work at a very new company\nfor now called Oxman, looking to revolutionize how humans design and build products working\nwith nature, not against it. On a personal note, let\nme say that Neri has, for a long time, been a\nfriend and someone who, in my darker moments,\nhas always been there with a note of kindness and support. I am forever grateful to her. She's a brilliant and a\nbeautiful human being. Oh, and she also brought me a present, \"War and Peace\" by Tolstoy, and \"Meditations\" by Marcus Aurelius. It doesn't get better than that. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Neri Oxman. Let's start with the universe. Do you ever think of the\nuniverse as a kind of machine that designs beautiful\nthings at multiple scales? - I do, and I think of nature\nin that way in general, in the context of design, specifically, I think of nature as everything\nthat isn't Anthropomass, everything that is not\nproduced by humankind, the birds and the rocks\nand everything in between, fungi, elephants, whales. - Do you think there's an intricate ways in which there's a connection\nbetween humans and nature? - Yes, and we're looking for it. I think that from, let's say,\nfrom the beginning of mankind, going back 200,000 years, the products that we have designed have separated us from nature. And it's ironic that the\nthings that we designed and produced as humankind, those are exactly the\nthings that separated us. Before that we were to totally\nand completely connected. And I want to return to that world. - But bring the tools of engineering and computation to it?\n- Yes. Yes. I absolutely believe that there is so much to nature that we\nstill have not leveraged, and we still have not understood,\nand we still haven't... And so much of our work is designed, but a lot of it is science, is unveiling and finding new truths about the natural world that\nwe were not aware before. Everybody talks about\nintelligence these days, but I like to think that\nnature has kind of wisdom that exists beyond intelligence\nor above intelligence. And it's that wisdom that we're trying to tap\ninto through technology. If you think about humans versus nature, at least in the realm, at least in the context\nof definition of nature, is everything but Anthropomass. And I'm using Ron Milo, who is an incredible professor\nfrom the Weizmann Institute, who came up with this definition\nof Anthropomass in 2020 when he identified that\n2020 was the crossover year when Anthropomass exceeded\nbiomass on the planet. So all of the design\ngoods that we have created and brought into the world now outweigh all of the biomass, including, of course, all plastics and wearables,\nbuildings, cities, but also asphalt and concrete, all outweigh the scale of the biomass. And actually, that was a moment, you know how in life\nthere are moments that (Lex laughs)\n(laughs) maybe a handful of moments that get you to course correct. And my, it was a Zoom\nconversation with Ron, and that was a moment for me when I realized that imbalance, ugh, now we've superseded the\nbiomass on the planet. Where do we go from here? And you've heard the expression\nmore phones than bones and the Anthropomass and the Anthropocene and the technosphere sort of\noutweighing the biosphere. But now we are really trying\nto look at is there a way in which all things\ntechnosphere are designed as if they're part of the biosphere. Meaning if you could today\ngrow instead of build everything and anything, if\nyou could grow an iPhone, if you could grow a car, what\nwould that world look like? Where the Turing test\nfor sort of this kind of, I call this material ecology approach, but this notion that everything material, everything that you design\nin the physical universe can be read and written to as, or thought of or perceived\nof, as nature-grown. That's sort of the Turing\ntest for the company, or at least that's how I started. I thought, well grow everything. That's sort of the slogan.\nLet's grow everything. And if we grow everything,\nis there a world in which driving a car\nis better for nature than a world in which there are no cars? Is it possible that a world in which you build buildings in cities, that those buildings in\ncities actually augment and heal nature, as\nopposed to their absence? Is there a world in which we now go back to that kind of synergy\nbetween nature and humans, where you cannot separate\nbetween grown and made, and it doesn't even matter? - Is there a good term\nfor the intersection between biomass and Anthropomass, like things that are grown? - Yeah, so in 2005, I called\nthis material ecology. I thought, what if all material, all things materials,\nwould be considered part of the ecology and would have an impact, a positive impact on the ecology, where we work together to help each other? All things nature, all things human. And again, you can say that wisdom in nature exists in fungi. Many mushroom lovers always\ncontest my thesis here saying, \"Well, we have the mushroom network and we have the mother trees,\nand they're all connected. And why don't we just\nsimply hack into mushrooms?\" Well, first of all,\nyes, they're connected, but that network stops when\nthere is a physical gap. That network does not necessarily enable the whales in the Dominican to connect with an olive tree in Israel to connect with a weeping\nwillow in Montana. And that's sort of a world\nthat I'm dreaming about. What what does it mean for nature to have access to the cloud? The kind of bandwidth\nthat we're talking about, sort of think Neuralink\nfor nature, you know, since the first computer, and you know this by heart\nprobably better than I do, but we're both MIT lifers. We today have computational\npower that is 1 trillion times the power that we had in those times. We have 26.5 trillion times the bandwidth and 11.5 quintillion times the memory, which is incredible. So humankind, since the first computer, has approached and accessed\nsuch incredible bandwidth, and we're asking, well, what\nif nature had that bandwidth? So beyond genes and\nevolution, if there was a way to augment nature and allow it\naccess to the world of bits, what does nature look like now? And can nature make decisions for herself as opposed to being guided and guarded and abused by humankind? - So nature has this inherent\nwisdom that you spoke to, but you're also referring to\naugmenting that inherent wisdom with something like a\nlarge language model. - Exactly.\n- So compress human knowledge, but also maintain whatever\nis that intricate wisdom that allows plants, bacteria, fungi to grow incredible things\nat arbitrary scales, adapting to whatever environment and just surviving and thriving, no matter where, no matter how. - Exactly. So I think of it as large molecule models and those large molecule models- - (laughs) Love that.\n- Of course, large language models are based on Google and search engines and so on and so forth, and we don't have this data currently. And part of our mission\nis to do just that, trying to quantify and understand\nthe language that exists across all kingdoms of life, across all five kingdoms of life, and if we can understand that language, is there a way for us to\nfirst make sense of it, find logic in it, and then generate certain computational tools that empower nature to build better crops, to increase the level of biodiversity? In the company, we're constantly asking, what does nature want? Like, what does nature\nwant from a compute view? - If it knew it, what could\naid it in whatever the heck it's wanting to do?\n- Yeah. So we keep coming back to this answer of nature wants to increase information but decrease entropy, right? So find order, but constantly increase\nthe information scale. And this is true for what\nour work also tries to do, because we're constantly trying to fight against the dimensional\nmismatch between things made and things grown, right? And as designers, we are educated to think in X, Y, and Z, and that's pretty much where\narchitectural education ends and biological education begins. So in reducing that dimensional mismatch, we're missing out on opportunities to create things made as if grown. But in the natural environment, we're asking, can we provide nature with these extra dimensions? And again, I'm not sure what nature wants, but I'm curious as to what\nhappens when you provide these tools to the natural environments. Obviously with responsibility,\nobviously with control, obviously with ethics and moral code. But is there a world in which nature can help fix itself using those tools? - And by the way, we're talking about a company called Oxman. - [Neri] Yeah, just a\nfew words about the team. - Yeah, what kind of humans\nwork at a place like this that are trying to figure\nout what nature wants? - You know, I think\nthey're first like you, they're humanist first. They come from different disciplines and different disciplinary backgrounds. And just as an example, we\nhave a brilliant designer who is just a mathematical genius and a computer scientist\nand a mechanical engineer who is trained as a synthetic biologist. And now we're hiring a microbiologist and a chemist, architects of course, and designers, roboticist. So it's really, it's Noah's\nArk, right? Two of each. - And always dancing between\nthis line of the artificial, the synthetic and the real, what's the term for, and the natural. - Yeah, the built and the\ngrown, nature and culture. - Yeah.\n- Technology and biology. But we're constantly seeking\nto ask how can we build, design and deploy\nproducts in three scales, the molecular scale,\nwhich I briefly hinted to. And there in the molecular scale, we're really looking to understand whether there's a universal\nlanguage to nature, and what that language is, and then build a tool that I think and dream of it is the iPhone for nature. If nature had an iPhone, what\nwould that iPhone look like? - Does that mean creating an interface? - Yeah.\n- Between nature and the computational tools we have? - Exactly, it goes back to\nthat 11.5 quintillion times the bandwidth that humans\nhave now arrived at. And giving that to nature and seeing, you know, what happens there? Can animals actually use this interface to know that they need\nto run away from fire? Can plants use this interface\nto increase the rate of photosynthesis in the\npresence of a smoke cloud? Can they do this, quote\nunquote, automatically without a kind of a top-down\nbrute-force policy-based method that's authored and deployed by humans? And so this work really relates to that interface with the natural world. And then there's a second\narea in the company which focuses on growing products. And here we're focusing\non a single product that starts from CO2.\n- Mm-hmm. - It becomes a product. It's consumed, it's used,\nit's worn by a human, and then it goes back to the soil and it grows an edible fruit plant. - So we're talking\nabout from CO2 to fruit. - Yeah, it starts from CO2\nand it ends with something that you can like literally eat. - Yes. - So the world's first\nentirely biodegradable, biocompatible, bio renewable product. - That's grown?\n- Yes. Either using plant\nmatter or using bacteria, but we are really looking at\ncarbon recycling technologies that start with methane or wastewater and end with this wonderful\nreincarnation of a thing that doesn't need to end\nup in a composting site, but can just be thrown into the ground and grow olive and find peace. And there's a lot of textile-based work out there that is focused\non one single element in this long chain, like,\noh, let's create, you know, leather out of mycelium or let's create textile out of cellulose. But then it stops there and\nyou get to assembling the shoe or the wearable and you, and\nyou need a little bit of glue and you need a little bit of this material and a little bit of that material to make it water-resistant,\nand then it's over. So that's one thing that\nwe're trying to solve for, is how to create a product\nthat is materially, computationally, robotically novel, and goes through all of these\nphases from the creation, from this carbon recycling\ntechnology to the product, to literally how do you\nthink about, you know, reinventing an industry\nthat is focused on assembly and putting things together\nand using humans to do that. Can that happen just\nusing robots and microbes and that's it?\n- And doing it end-to-end. I would love to see what this- - It looks cool. (laughs)\n- Factory looks like. - And the factory is great\ntoo. I'm very, very excited. In October, we'll share first renditions of some of this work. And in February we'll\ninvite you to the lab. - I'm there.\n(Neri laughs) - I've already applied.\nI haven't hear back. I don't understand.\n(Neri laughs) Okay, let me, just before\nwe get to number three, it'd be amazing to just\ntalk about what it takes with robotic arms, or in general, the whole process of how\nto build a life form, stuff you've done in the past,\nmaybe stuff you're doing now, how to use bacteria, this\nkind of synthetic biology. - Yeah.\n- How to grow stuff by leveraging bacteria. Is there examples from the past and- - Yes, and just take a\nstep back over the 10 years of the Mediated Matter Group,\nwhich was my group at MIT, has sort of dedicated itself to, bio-based design would be a suitcase word, but sort of thinking about that synergy between nature and culture,\nbiology and technology. And we attempted to build\na suite of embodiments, let's say, that they ended\nup in amazing museums and amazing shows and we wrote patents and papers on them, but\nthey were still n of 1s. - Mm-hmm.\n- Again, the challenge, as you say, was to grow them. And we classified them into fibers, cellular solids, biopolymers, pigments. And in each of the examples, although the material was different, sometimes we used fibers, sometimes we used silk with silkworms and honey with bees and or comb as the structural material. With vespers, we used\nsynthetically engineered bacteria to produce pigments. Although the materials were different and the hero organisms were different, the philosophy was always the same. The approach was really an approach of computational templating. That templating allowed\nus to create templates for the natural environment, where nature and technology could duet, could dance together to\ncreate these products. So just, just as a few\nexamples with silk pavilion, we've had a couple of\npavilions made of silk. And the second one,\nwhich was the bigger one, which ended up at the Museum\nof Modern Art with my friend, an incredible mentor, Paola Antonelli, that pavilion was six meter tall and it was produced by silkworms. And there we had different\ntypes of templates. There were physical templates\nthat were basically just these water soluble meshes upon which the silkworms were spinning. And then there were\nenvironmental templates, which was a robot basically\napplying variation of environmental conditions such as heat and light to guide the\nmovement of the silkworm. - You're saying so many amazing things, and I'm trying not to interrupt you, but like one of the things\nyou've learned by observing, by doing science on these\nis that the environment defines the shape that\nthey create or contributes or intricately plays with\nthe shape they create. And so like, and that's one of the ways you can get to guide their work is by defining that environment. By the way you said hero\norganism, which is an epic term. (Neri laughs)\nSo that means like is whatever is the\nbiological living system that's doing the creation. - And that's what's happening\nin pharma and biomaterials. And by the way, precision ag and food, new food design technologies\nas people are betting on a hero organism is the\nsort of how I think of it. (Lex speaks indistinctly)\nAnd the hero organism is, sometimes it's the palm\noil or it's the mycelium. There's a lot of mushrooms\naround for good and bad, and it's cellulose or it's, you know, fake bananas or the workhorse E. coli. But these hero organisms are\nbeing betted on as like the, what's the one answer\nthat solves everything? Hitchhiker's Guide, 42.\n- 42, yeah. - These are sort of the 42s of, you know, of the enchanted new universe. And back at MIT we\nsaid, instead of betting on all of these organisms,\nlet's approach them as almost like movement in a symphony. And let's kind of lean\ninto what we can learn from each of these\norganisms in the context of building a project in\nan architectural scale. And those usually were pavilions. - And then the computational templating is the way you guide the work of this. How many did you say, 17,000? - 17,532. So each of these silkworms\nthreads are about, you know, one mile in distance\nand they're beautiful. And when, and just\nthinking about the amount of material, you know,\nit's a bit like thinking about you know, the length\nof capillary vessels that grow in your belly\nwhen you're pregnant to feed that incredible new life form. It is just, nature is amazing. But back to the silkworms,\nI think I had three months to build this incredible pavilion, but we couldn't figure out how\nwe were thinking of emulating the process of how a silkworm goes about building its\nincredible architecture. This cocoon over the\nperiod of 24 to 72 hours, and it builds a cocoon\nbasically to protect itself. It's a beautiful form of architecture and it uses pretty much\njust two materials, two chemical compounds,\nsericin and fibroin. The sericin is sort of\nthe glue of the cocoon. The fibroin is the fiber-based\nmaterial of the cocoon and through fibers and glue, and that's true for so\nmany systems in nature, lots of fiber and glue. And that architecture allows\nthem to metamorphosize. And in the process, they vary the properties\nof that silk thread. So it's stiffer or softer depending on where it is in the\nsection of the cocoon. And so we were trying to\nemulate this robotically with a 3D printer that\nwas 6-axis KUKA arm, one of these baby KUKAs, and we're trying to emulate\nthat process computationally and build something very large. When one of my students, now an a brilliant industrial\nengineer roboticist on my team, Marcus, said, \"Well, you know, we were just\nplaying with those silkworms and enjoying their presence when we realized that if\nthey're placed on a desk or a horizontal surface, they will go about creating their cocoon. Only the cocoon would be flat, because they're constantly\nlooking for a vertical post in order to use that post as\nan anchor to spin the cocoon. But in the absence of that post, on surfaces that are less\nthan 21 millimeters and flat, they will spin flat patches and we say, aha, let's work with\nthem to produce this dome as a set of flat patches\nand a silkworm mind you, is quite an egocentric creature. And actually the furthest you go, you move forward in evolution\nby natural selection, the more egoism you find in creatures. So when you think about termites, right? Their material sophistication\nis actually very primitive, but they have incredible ability to communicate and\nconnect with each other. So if you think about the\nentire, all of nature, let's say, all of living systems as like a matrix that runs across two axes. One is material sophistication, which is terribly relevant for designers, and the other is communication. The termites ace on communication, but their material\nsophistication is crap, right? It's just saliva and feces\nand some soil particles that are built to create these\nincredible termite mounds. The scale that when compared\nto human skyscrapers transcend all of buildable scales, at least in terms of what we have today in architectural practice, just in relative to the\nsize of the termite. But when you look at the silkworm, the silkworm has zero connection and communication across silkworms. They were not designed to connect and communicate with each other. They're sort of a human design species because the domesticated silk moth creates the cocoon, we then produce the silk\nof it, and then it dies. So it has dysfunctional\nwings. It cannot fly. So, and that's another problem that the sericulture industry has, is why did we in the first place, author this organism 4,000\nyears ago that is unable to fly and is just there to basically live as, to serve a human need, which is textiles. And so here we were fascinated by the computational kind of\nbiology dimension of silkworms. But along the way, by\nthe way, this is great. I never get to tell the full story. This is so great.\n- I'm enjoying this so much. (Lex laughs)\n- I'm always, like people say I speak in Nietzschean paragraphs They're way too long. And this is wonderful.\nThis is like heaven. - Nietzschean paragraphs.\n(Neri laughs) You drop us so many good\nlines. I love it, okay. - But really, those\nsilkworms are not, yes, they're not designed to\nbe like humans, right? They're not designed to\nconnect, communicate, and build things that are\nbigger than themselves through connection and communication. - So what happens when you add 17,000 of them communicating if that- - That's a really great question. What happens is that at some point, the templating strategies,\nand as you said correctly, there were geometrical\ntemplating, material templating, environmental templating,\nchemical templating, if you're using pheromones\nto guide the movement of bees in the absence of a queen.\n- This is so cool. - Where you have a robotic queen. - Uh-huh. Robotic queen?\n- But whenever you have these templating strategies, you have sort of control\nover nature, right? But the question is there a world in which we can move from templating, from providing these\ncomputational material and immaterial physical\nand molecular platforms that guide nature, almost\nlike guiding a product, almost like a gardener, to\na problem or an opportunity of emergence where that\nbiological organism assumes agency by virtue of accessing the\nrobotic code and saying, now I own the code. I get to do what I want with this code. Let me show you what this\npavilion may look like or this product may look like. And I think one of the\nexciting moments for us is when we realized that\nthese robotic platforms that were designed initially as templates actually inspired, if I may, a kind of a collaboration and\ncooperation between silkworms that are not a swarm-based organism. They're not like the\nbees and the termites. They don't work together and\nthey don't have, you know, social orders amongst them, the queen and the drones, et cetera. They're all the same in a way, right? And here, what was so exciting for us is that these computational\nand fabrication technologies enable the silkworm to\nkind of hop (laughs) from the branch in ecology of worms to the branch in ecology of\nmaybe human-like intelligence where they could connect and communicate by virtue of, you know, feeling or rubbing against each other in an area\nthat was hotter or colder. And they were, so the product\nthat we got at the end, the variation of density of fiber and the distribution of the\nfiber and the transparency. The product at the end seems like it was produced by a swarm silk community, but of course it wasn't. It's a bunch of biological\nagents working together to assemble this thing that's really, really fascinating to us. How can technology augment or enable a swarm-like behavior in creatures that have not been\ndesigned to work as swarms? - So how do you construct\na computational template from which a certain\nkind of thing emerges? So how can you predict\nwhat emerges, I suppose? - So if you can predict it\ndoesn't count as emergence. Actually, I think. (laughs)\n(Lex laughs) - That's a deeply poetic line.\n- We can talk about it. - I mean, it just kind of-\n- It's a bit like if you measure it, it\ndoesn't count. (laughs) - (laughs) Right Right. - Speaking of emergence, an empowerment, because we're constantly\nmoving between those as if they're equals on\nthe team, and one of them, Christoph, shared with me\na mathematical equation for what does it mean to empower nature and what does empowerment\nin nature look like? And that relates to emergence, and we can go back to\nemergence in a few moments, but I want to, I want to say it so that I know that I've\nlearned it. (laughs) (Lex laughs) And if I've learned\nit, I can use it later. - Yeah. And maybe you'll figure something\nout as you say it, also. - Of course Christoph is the master here, but really we were thinking again, what does nature want? Nature wants to increase\nthe information dimension and reduce entropy. What do we want? We kind of want the same thing, we want more, but we want order, right? And this goes back to your conversation with Joscha about stochastic versus deterministic\nlanguages or processes. His definition, or the definition he found was that an agent is empowered if the entropy of the\ndistribution of all of its states, it's high, while the entropy of the distribution of a\nsingle state given a choice, given an action is low. Meaning it's that kind of, yeah, duality between opportunity,\nlike starting like this and going like this, opening and closing. And this really, I think is\nanalogous to human empowerment. Given infinite wide array of choices, what is the choice that you\nmake to, you know, to enable, to empower, to provide you\nwith the agency that you need? - And how much does that making\nthat choice actually control the trajectory of the system? That's really nice. So this applies to all\nthe kinds of systems you're talking about?\n- Yeah. And the cool thing is it can apply to a human on an individual basis, or a silkworm or a bee or a microbe. A microbe that has agency,\nor by virtue of a template. But it also applies to a community of organisms like the bees. And so we've done a lot of\nwork sort of moving from, you've asked how to grow things. So we've grown things using co-fabrication where we're digitally\nfabricating with other organisms that live across the\nvarious kingdoms of life. And those were silkworms and bees. And with bees, which\nwe've sent to outer space and returned healthily and\nthey were reproductive. - Okay, you're gonna\nhave to tell that story. (Neri laughs)\nYou're gonna have to talk about the robotic queen and\nthe pheromones, come on. All right.\n- So we've built what we called a synthetic apiary. And the synthetic apiary was\ndesigned as an environment that was a perpetual spring environment for the bees of Massachusetts. They go on hibernation, of\ncourse, during the winter season, and then we lose 80% of them\nor more during that period. We were thinking, okay, what if we created this\nenvironment where... Before you template, right\nbefore you can design with, you have to design for, right? You have to create this\nspace of mutualism, space of sort of shared connection between you and the organism. And with bees, it started\nas the synthetic apiary. And we have proven that\ncurated environment where we designed the space\nwith high levels of control, of temperature, humidity, and light. And we've proven that they\nwere reproductive and alive. And we realized, wow, this\nenvironment that we created can help augment bees in the winter season in any city around the world\nwhere bees survive and thrive in the summer and spring seasons. And could this be a kind\nof a new urban typology, an architectural typology\nof symbiosis of mutualism between organisms and humans? Where these, by the way, the synthetic apiary was in a co-op, you know, nearby Somerville\n- Mm-hmm. - We had, you know, we had\nrobots, our team, you know, schlepped there every day\nwith our tools and machines and we made it happen, and\nthe neighbors were very happy. And they got to get a ton of\nhoney at the end of the winter. And those bees, of course\nwere released into the wild at the end of the winter,\nalive and kicking. So then in order to actually experiment with the robotic queen,\nan idea, a concept, we had to prove obviously\nthat we can create this space for bees. And then after that we had\nthis amazing opportunity to send the bees to space\non Blue Shepherd mission that is part of Blue Origin. And we of course said,\nyes, we'll take a slot. We said, okay, can we outdo NASA? So NASA in 1982 had an experiment where they sent bees to outer space. The bees returned, they\nwere not reproductive, and some of them died. And we thought, well, is there a way in which we can create\na life support system, almost like a small mini-biolab\nof a queen and her retinue that would be sent in this Blue\nOrigin Blue Shepherd mission in this one cell. And so if the synthetic apiary\nwas an architectural project, in this case, this second\nsynthetic apiary was a product. It was, right, so from an architectural\ncontrolled environment to a product-scale controlled environment. And this biolab, this life\nsupport system for bees was designed to provide the bees with all the conditions that they needed, and we looked at that time\nat the Nasonov pheromone that the queen uses to\nguide the other bees, and we looked at pheromones\nthat are associated with a bee. And thinking of those\npheromones being released inside that capsule that\ngoes to outer space. They returned back to the media lab roof, and those bees were alive\nand kicking and reproductive, and, you know, and they\ncontinued to create comb. And it ended with a beautiful nature paper that the team and I published together. We gave them gold nanoparticles\nand silver nanoparticles because we were interested\nif bees recycle wax. It was known forever that\nbees do not recycle the wax. And by feeding them\nthese gold nanoparticles, we were able to prove that the bees actually do recycle the wax. The reason I'm bringing this forward is because we don't view\nourselves as designers of consumable products and\narchitectural environments only, but we love that moment\nwhere these technologies, and by the way, every one of\nthese projects that we created involved the creation of a new technology, whether it be a glass printer\nor the spinning robot, or the life support\nsystem for the bee colony. They all involved a technology that was associated with the project. And I never ever, ever, ever\nwant to let that part go. 'cause I love, love technology so much. But also another element of this is that always these\nprojects, if they're great, they reveal new knowledge about, or new science about the topic\nthat you're investigating, be it, you know, silkworms\nor bees or glass. That's why I say, I always tell\nmy team it should be at MoMA and the cover of Nature or\nScience at the same time, or we don't separate between\nthe art and the science. It's one of the same. - So as you're creating the art, you're going to learn\nsomething about these organisms or something about these materials. I mean, is there something\nthat stands out to you about these hero organisms\nlike bees, silkworms? You mentioned E. coli has its\npros and cons, this bacteria. What have you learned, that small or big, that's interesting about these organisms? - Yeah, that's a beautiful question. What have I learned? I've learned that, you know, we also worked with shrimp\nshells, with Aguahoja. We built this tower on\nthe roof of the SFMOMA, which by a couple of months ago and until it was on the roof,\nwe've shown the structure completely biodegrade into\nthe, well not completely, but almost completely\nbiodegrade to the soil. And this notion that a product or part, an organism or part of that\norganism can reincarnate is very, very moving thought to me, because I want to believe that\nI believe in reincarnation. - I want to believe that I believe. - Yeah that's my relationship-\n- I want to believe. - With God, I like to\nbelieve in believing. Most great things in life are\nsecond derivatives of things. But (laughs) that's part\nof another conversation. - I feel like that's a quote\nthat's gonna take weeks to really internalize that. - That notion of I want you to want, or I need you to need, or that there's always something, a deeper truth behind\nwhat is on the surface. And so I like to go to the second and tertiary derivative of things and discover new truths\nabout them through that. But what have I learned about organisms? - And why don't you like E. coli? - I like E. Coli, and a lot\nof the work that we've done was not possible without\nour working on E. coli or other workhorse organisms,\nlike cyanobacteria. - How are bacteria used?\n- Death masks. (Lex laughs)\nThe death masks. - So what are death masks? - So we did this project called Vespers, and those were basically death masks that was set as a process for\ndesigning a living product. What happen, and I looked at, I remember looking at\nBeethoven's death mask and Agamemnon's death mask, and just studying how they were created. And really they were sort\nof geometrically attuned to the face of the dead. And what we wanted to do\nis create a death mask that was not based on the shape of the wearer, but rather was based on their\nlegacy and their biology. And maybe we could harness\na few stem cells there for future generations or\ncontain the last breath. Lazarus, which preceded Vespers, was a project where we designed a mask to contain a single breath,\na last breath of the wearer. And again, if I had access\nto these technologies today, I would totally reincorporate my grandmother's last breath in a product. So it was like an air memento. So with Vespers, we actually used E. coli to create pigmented masks. Masks whose pigments would be recreated at the surface of the mask. And I'm skipping over a lot of content, but basically there were 15 masks and they were created as three sets. The masks of the past,\nthe masks of the present and the mask of the future. The masks, there were five, five and five, and the masks of the past\nwere based on ornaments and they were embedded with\nnatural minerals, like gold. Yes, yes, yes.\n- And we're looking at pictures of these and are gorgeous. - Yes, yes.\n- Extremely delicate and interesting fractal\npatterns that are symmetrical. - They look symmetrical, but they're not. This is intent. We intended for you to be tricked and think that they're\nall symmetrical, but- - [Lex] There's imperfections. - There are imperfections by design. All of these forms and shapes and distribution of matter that you're looking at\nwas entirely designed using a computational program,\nso none of it is manual. But long story short, the first collection is about the surface of the mask. And the second collection,\nwhich you're looking at, is about the volume of the mask and what happens to the\nmask when all the colors from the surface, yes, enter\nthe volume of the mask inside, create pockets and channels\nto guide life through them. They were incorporated with pigment-producing living organisms. And then those organisms\nwere templated to recreate the patterns of the original death masks. And so life recycles and re-begins, and so on and so forth. The past meets the future.\nThe future meets the past. From the surface to the volume, from death to life, to death\nto life, to death to life. And that again, is a recurring theme in the projects that we take on. But there, from a\ntechnological perspective, what was interesting is that\nwe embedded chemical signals in the jet, in the printer,\nand those chemical signals basically interacted with the pigment-producing bacteria, in this case E. Coli, that were introduced on\nthe surface of the mask. And those interactions\nbetween the chemical signals inside the resins and the\nbacteria at the surface of the mask at the resolution\nthat is native to the printer, in this case 20 microns per voxel, allowed us to compute the exact patterns that we wanted to achieve. And we thought, wow, well if\nwe can do this with pigments, can we do this with antibiotics? If we can do this with antibiotics, could we do it with melanin? And what are the implications? Again, this is a platform technology. Now that we have it, what are the actual\nreal-world implications and potential applications\nfor this technology? And we started a new area\nof, one of my students, Rachel, her PhD thesis was titled after this new class of materials that we created through\nthis project, Vespers, \"Hybrid Living Materials,\" HLMs, and these hybrid living\nmaterials really paved the way towards a whole other set of\nproducts that we've designed, like the work that we did with melanin for the Mandela Pavilion\nthat we presented at SFMOMA, where again, we're using the\nsame principles of templating, in this case not silkworms and not bees, but we're templating bacteria at a much, much, much\nmore finer resolution. And now instead of\ntemplating using a robot, we're templating using a printer. But compute is very, very much part of it. And the what's nice about\nbacteria, of course, is that from an ethical perspective, I think there's a range, right? So at the end of the silk pavilion, I got an email from professor\nin Japan who has been working on transgenic silk and said, \"Well, if you did this\ngreat, amazing silk pavilion, why don't we create, you know, glow-in-the-light silk dresses?\" And in order to create this\nglow-in-the-light silk, we need to, you know, to apply genes that are taken from a\nspider to a silk worm. And this is what is known\nas a transgenic operation. And we said no. And that was for us, a\nclear decision that no, we will work with these organisms as long as we know that\nwhat we are doing with them is not only better for humans, but it's also better for them. And again, just to remind you, I forget the exact number, but it's around 1,000\ncocoons per single shirt that are exterminated in India and China, and in those sericulture\nindustries that are being abused. Now, yes, this organism was designed to serve the human species. And maybe we should, maybe it's time, you know, to retire that, you\nknow, that conception (laughs) of organisms that are designed\nfor a human-centric world or human-centric set of applications. I don't feel the same way about E. coli, not that I'm agnostic, organism agnostic. But still, I believe\nthere's so much for us to do on this planet with bacteria. - And so in general, your design principle is to grow cool stuff as a byproduct of the organism flourishing? So not using the organism.\n- Yes. - The win-win, the synergy.\n- Win-win. - A whole that's bigger\nthan the sum of its parts. - It's interesting. I mean, it just feels like a gray area where genetic modification of an organism, it just feels like, I don't know, if you genetically modified me to make me glow in the light, I kind of kind of like it.\n- I think you have enough of an aura. (laughs)\n- All right, thank you. I was just fishing for\ncompliments. Thank you. I appreciate it though.\n- But you're absolutely right. (Lex laughing)\nAnd by the way, the gray area is, you know, is\nwhere some of us like to live and like to thrive, and that's okay. And thank goodness that\nthere's so many of us that like the black and white and that thrive in the black and white. My husband is a good\nexample for that. (laughs) - But just to clarify, in this case, you are also trying to thrive\nin the black and white, in that you're saying like-\n- Yes. - The silk warm is a\nbeautiful, wonderful creature. Let us not modify it. Is that the idea? Or is it okay to modify a little bit as long as we can see that\nit benefits the organism as well as the final creation? - So with silkworms, absolutely, let's not modify it genetically.\n- Okay. - Let's not modify it\ngenetically, and then some. Because why did we get there\nto begin with 4,000 years ago in the Silk Road? And we should never get to\na point where we evolve life for the service of mankind at the risk of these wonderful creatures across the kingdoms,\nacross the kingdom of life. I don't think about the\nsame kind of ethical range when I think about bacteria. - Nevertheless, bacteria are\npretty wonderful organisms. - I'm moving to my\nsecond cup here. (laughs) - [Lex] Yes, take tea two. As things are getting serious now. - Bacteria are, yeah, for sure. - Let's give bacteria all\nthe love they deserve. We wouldn't be here without them. They were here for, I\ndon't know what it is, like a billion years before\nanything else showed up? - But in a way, if you think about it, they create the matter that we consume, and then reincarnate or\ndissolved into the soil, and then creates a tree, and then that tree creates more bacteria, and then that bacteria could... I mean, again, that's why I like to think about not recycling, but reincarnating, because that assumes a kind\nof imparting upon nature, that dimension of agency\nand maybe awareness. But yeah, lots of really interesting work happening with bacteria. Directed evolution is one of them. We're looking at directed evolution, so high-throughput directed evolution of bacteria for the\nproduction of products. And again, those products\ncan be a shoe, wearables, biomaterials, therapeutics. - And doing that\ndirection computationally? - Totally computationally, obviously, in the lab with the hero\norganism, the hero bacteria. And what's happening today in ecomicrobial synthetic biology, synthetic biology that\nlends itself to ecology, and again, all of these\nfields are coming together. It's such a wonderful\ntime to be a designer. I can't think of a better time to be a designer in this world, but with high-throughput\ndirected evolution, and I should say that the\nphysical space in our new lab will have these capsules,\nwhich we have designed. They're designed like growth\nchambers or grow rooms. And in those grow rooms,\nwe can basically program top-down environmental templating, or top-down environmental\ncontrol of lights, humidity, light, et cetera, sorry, light,\nhumidity and temperature, while doing bottom-up genetic regulation. So it is a wet lab, but in that wet lab, you could do at the same time, you know, genetic modulation, regulation\nand environmental templating. And then again, the idea is\nthat in one of those capsules, maybe we grow transparent wood and in another capsule we, you know, we transparent wood for\narchitectural application, another capsule, we grow a shoe. And in another capsule we look\nat that language, you know, large language model that\nwe talk talked about. And there's a particular\ntechnology associated with that, which we're hoping to reveal\nto the world in February. And each of those capsules is basically a high-throughput\ncomputational environment, like a breadboard that has, think of sort of a physical\nbreadboard environment that has access to oxygen\nand nitrogen and CO2 and nutritional dispensing. And these little capsules\ncould be stressed. They're sort of an ecology in a box, and they could be stressed to\nproduce the food of the future or the products of the future, or the construction\nmaterials of the future. Food is a very interesting one, obviously because of food insecurity and the issues that we have around both in terms of food insecurity, but also in terms of the future of food and what will remain after we can't eat plants and animals anymore, and all we can eat is these\nfalse bananas and, you know, and insects as our protein source. So there we're thinking, you know, can we design these capsules\nto stress an environment and see how that environment behaves? Think about a kind of an ecological, a biodiversity chamber, right? A kind of a time capsule\nthat is designed as a biodiversity chamber\nwhere you can program the exact temperature,\nhumidity, and light combination to emulate the environment from the past. So Ohio, 1981, December 31st\nat 5:00 AM in the morning, what did tomatoes taste like? To all the way in the\nfuture, 200 years ago? These are the environmental inputs. These are some genetic\nregulations that I'm testing and what might the food of the future or the products of the future or the construction\nmaterials of the future feel like, taste like,\nbehave, like, et cetera. And so these capsules are\ndesigned as part of a lab. That's why it's been\ntaking us such a long time to get to this point, because we started designing them in 2019, and they're currently,\nliterally as I speak to you, under construction.\n- How well is it understood how to do this dance of controlling these different variables\nin order for various kinds of growth to happen? - It's not. It's never been done before, and these capsules have\nnever been designed before. So you know, when we first decided these are going to be\nenvironmental capsules, people thought were crazy. \"What are you building?\nWhat are you making?\" So the answer is that we don't know, but we know that there has\nnever been a space like this where you have basically a wet lab and a grow room at that\nresolution, at that granularity of control over organisms. There is a reason why there\nis this incredible evolution of products in the software space. The hardware space, that's\na more limiting space, because of the physical\ninfrastructure that we have to test and experiment with things. So we really wanted to\npush on creating a wet lab that is novel in every possible way. What could you create in it?\nYou could create the future. You could create an environment of plants talking to each\nother with a robotic referee, and the robotic referee, you know, and you could set an objective\nfunction, and let's say for the transaction-driven\nindividuals in the world, let's say the objective function\nis carbon sequestration. And all of those plants are implemented with a gaming engine, and they have these reward system, right, and they're constantly\nneeding to optimize the way in which they carbon-sequest. We weed out the bad guys,\nwe leave the good guys, and we end up with this like ideal ecology of carbon-sequestering heroes that connect and\ncommunicate with each other. And once we have that model,\nthis biodiversity chamber, we send it out into the field, and we see what happens in nature. And that's sort of what I'm talking about, augmenting plants with\nthat extra dimension of bandwidth that they do not have. They're just, just last week I came across a paper that discusses the in vivo neurons that are augmented with a pong game, and in a dish they\nbasically present sentience and the beginning of awareness, which is wonderful.\n- Yeah. - Like that you could\nactually take these neurons from a mouse brain and you\nhave the electrical circuits and the physiological circuits\nthat enable these cells to connect and communicate and, together, arrive at sort of swarm\nsituation that allows them to act as a system that\nis not only perceived to be sentient, but is actually sentient. Michael Levin calls agential material, material that has agency, right? So this is of interest to us\nbecause this is sort of, again, this is emergence post-templating. You template until you don't\nneed to template anymore because the system has\nits own rules, right? What we don't want to happen with AGI we want to happen with synthetic biology. What we don't want to happen online and software with language,\nwe want for it to happen with bio-based materials, because that will get us\ncloser to growing things, as opposed to assembly\nand mechanically, yeah, putting them together with\ntoxic materials and compounds. - If I can ask a pothead\nquestion for a second. (Neri laughs)\nSo you mentioned, just like the silkworms,\nthe individualist silkworms got to actually learn how to collaborate. - Yes, yes, yes.\n- Or actually to collaborate, like in a swarm-like way. you're talking about getting\nplants to communicate in some interesting way based\non an objective function. Is it possible to have\nsome kind of interface between another kind of\norganisms, humans and nature? So like a human to have a\nconversation with a plant? - There already is. You know that when we\ncut freshly cut grass? I love the smell.\n- Mm-hmm. - But it's a smell of, actually, it's a smell of distress\nthat the leafs of grass are communicating to each other. So the grass, when it's cut, emits green leaf volatiles, GLVs, and those GLVs are\nbasically one leaf of grass communicating to another leaf of grass. Be careful, mind you,\nyou're about to be cut. (Lex laughs)\nThese incredible life forms are communicating using a\ndifferent language than ours. We use language models,\nthey use molecular models. At the moment where we can parse, we can decode these molecular moments is when we can start having\na conversation with plants. Now, of course there is a lot of work around plant neurobiology. It's a real thing. Plants do not have nervous system, but they have something\nakin to a nervous system. It has a kind of a ecological\nintelligence that is focused on a particular timescale,\nand the timescale is very, very slow, slow,\nslow, slow timescale. So it is when we can melt these timescales and connect with these plants in terms of the content of the language, in this case molecules, the\nduration of the language, and we can start having a conversation, if not simply to understand what is happening in the plant kingdom. Precision agriculture, I promise to you, will look very, very different, right? Because right now we're using\ndrones to take photos of crops of corn that look bad. And when we take that photo,\nit's already too late. But if we understand\nthese molecular footprints and things that they are trying to say, the stress that they are\ntrying to communicate, then we could of course\npredict the physiological, biological behavior of these crops, both for their own self perpetuation, but also for the foods and the pharma and the type of molecules\nthat we're seeking to grow for the benefit of humanity. And so these languages\nthat we are attempting now to quantify and qualify\nwill really help us not only better nature and help nature in its striving to surviving, but also help us, you\nknow, design better wines and, you know, and better\nfoods and better medicine and better products. Again, across all scales,\nacross all application domains. - Is there intricacies to\nunderstand the timescales, like you mentioned, at\nwhich these communications, these languages, like, operate? Is there something different between the way humans communicate and the way plants\ncommunicate in terms of time? - Remember when we\nstarted the conversation talking about sort of definitions\nin the context of design, and then in the context of being? That question requires, I think, a kind of shift, a humility. That requires a kind of a\nhumility towards nature, understanding that it\noperates on different scales. We recently discovered that, you know, that the molecular footprint of a rose, or of a plant in general, during nighttime is different than its molecular\nfootprint during daytime. So these are circadian\nrhythms that are associated with what kind of molecules these plants emit given\nstresses and given, you know, there's a\nreason why the jasmine, a jasmine field smells so delicious in 4:00 AM in the morning, and then there's like, there's\npeace and rest amongst, you know, amongst the plants. And you have to sort of tune\ninto that time dimension of the plant kingdom. And that of course\nrequires all this humility where in a single capsule to\ndesign a biodiversity chamber, it will take years, not months,\nand definitely not days. And to see these products, and\nalso that humility in design comes from simply, you know,\nlooking at how we are today as a civilization, how\nwe use and abuse nature. Like just think of all these\nChristmas trees, right? These Christmas trees,\nthey take years to grow. We use them for one night,\nthe holiest night of the year, and then we let them go and think about, in nature to design a,\nquote unquote, product. An organism spends energy and time and thoughtfulness in\nmany, many, many years, and I'm thinking about the\nredwoods, to grow these channels, these, you know, this cellulose layers and channels and reach\nthese incredible heights takes sometimes hundreds of years, sometimes thousands of years. Am I afraid of building a\ncompany that designs products in the scale of thousands of years? No, I'm not. And the way of being in\nthe physical world today is really not in tune\nwith a time dimension of the natural world at all. And that needs to change. And that's obviously very,\nvery hard to do in a community of human beings that is, at\nleast in the western world, that is based on capitalism. And so here, the wonderful challenge that we have ahead of us is how do we impart upon\nthe capitalist movement? We know that we need\nto produce now products that will enter the real\nworld and be, you know, shared and used by\nothers and still benefit the natural world while benefiting humans, and that's a wonderful challenge to have. - So integrate technology with nature, and that's a really difficult problem. I see parallels here with\nanother company of Neuralink, which is basically like,\nI think you mentioned, Neuralink for nature, that there are short-term\nproducts you can come up with, but it's ultimately a long-term challenge of how do you integrate the machine with this creation of\nnature, this intricate, complex creation of nature,\nwhich is the human brain? And then you're speaking\nmore generally nature. - You know how every company has an image. Like, this one single image that embodies the spirit of the company. - Mm-hmm.\n- And I think for Neuralink, it was to me that chimpanzee\nplaying a video game. - (laughs) Mm-hmm.\n- It was just unbelievable. But with plants, there potentially is a set of molecules that\nimpacts or inspires, I like that word, the plant to behave or act in a certain way\nand allows still the plant the possibility of deciding where it or she or he wants to go, which is why our first product\nfor this molecular space is going to be a functionalized fragrance. So here we're thinking about\nthe future of fragrances, and the future of fragrances\nand flavors, you know, these products are in the\nindustry as we know it today, are designed totally\nfor a human-centric use and an enjoyment, an\nindulgence and luxury. They're used on the body for the sake of, I dunno, attraction and\nfeeling good and smelling good. And we were asking\nourselves, is there a world in which a fragrance can be\nnot a functional fragrance? 'Cause you could claim that\nall fragrances are functional, but is there a world\nin which the fragrance becomes functionalized? Is, again, imparted upon or given agency to connect with another organism. Is there a world in which\nyou and I can go down to your garden and use a\nperfume that will interact with the rose garden downstairs? I've just been enamored\nwith the statements that are being made in the media around, oh, this is completely\nbiologically derived fragrance and it's bio-based, but when\nyou look into the fragrance and you understand that in order to get to this bio-derived fragrance, you went through, you\nblew through, you know, 10,000 bushes of rose to create five milliliters of a rose fragrance. And all these 10,000 bushes of rose, they take space, they take, you know, water management and so much waste. Is this really what we want\nthe future of our agriculture and molecular goods to look like? And so when we did Aguahoja\npavilion on the roof of SFMOMA We calculated that for that pavilion, we had 40,000 calories\nembedded into this pavilion that was made of shrimp shells\nand chitosan and apple skins and cellulose from tree pulp. And we calculated that overall, the structure had 40,000 calories. Interesting way to think\nabout a structure, right? From the point of view of calories. But as you left the gallery,\nyou saw these three clocks that were so beautifully\ndesigned by Felix on our team. And these clocks measured\ntemperature and humidity. And we are connected\nthem to weather channels so that we could directly\nlook at how the pavilion was biodegrading in real time. And in our calculations, I say\nthis long-winded description of the pavilion to say\nthat in the calculation, we incorporated, you know, how much electricity we\nused for our computers, for the 3D printers that\nprinted the pavilion. And, you know, and these were called\nemergy calculations, right? Energy and materials. And when you think about a product and you think about, you\nknow, a shoe or a chair or a perfume or a building,\nyou don't stop at the object. You want to go all the way to the system, again, instead of designing objects or singular embodiments of\nthe will of the designer, you're really tapping\ninto an entire system that is interconnected. And if you look at the energy budget that characterized the project Aguahoja, it traverses the entire planet, right? Some of these shrimp shells were brought from places in the world\nwe haven't thought of, in terms of the apples\nand the shrimp shells and the tree pulp. And so going back to, you\nknow, going back to fragrances, it's really, really important\nto understand the product in the context of the ecological system from which it's sourced\nin how it's designed. And that is the kind of thinking\nthat is not only desired, but is required if we\nare to achieve synergy between humanity and nature. - And it's interesting, 'cause the system level\nthinking is almost always gonna take you to the entire Earth, to considering the entire Earth ecosystem. - Which is why it's important\nto have a left brain and a right brain competing\nfor attention. (laughs) And intimacy. (laughs)\n- Sometimes in the same head. Yeah.\n- Yes. - You you mentioned a fragrance\nthat kind of sends out a message to the environment, essentially. - A message in a bottle. Yeah.\n- A message in a bottle. So like, so you can go to a rose garden and trick the rose garden to think it's 4:00 AM, essentially? - You could, if you wanted to, but maybe that is...\n- Not trick. Trick is such a bad word.\n- Right. Right. - Inspire. (laughs)\n- Inspire, I like. I like the idea of providing\nnature with a choice, which is why I love that\nelegant mathematical equation of empowerment and agency. - Empower the rose garden\nto create a romantic moment for the wearer of the fragrance. - But now again, all of\nthis to go back to back to that human-centric notion of romance, but maybe there's another\nway to do romance, right? That we haven't yet explored. And maybe, you know, there's\na way to tap into what happens to the rose when it's dreaming. Assuming that plants are sentient, and assuming that we can\ntap into that sentience, what can we discover about\nwhat does the rose want? Like what does it actually\nwant? And what does it need? And what are the rose's, you know, dreams? - But do you think\nthere's some correlation in terms of romance, in terms of the word you\nsometimes use, magic? Is there some similarities\nin what humans want and what roses want and what nature wants? - I think so. I think there is. And if I did not think so, oh my goodness, this would not be a nice world to live in. I think we all want love. (laughs) I recently read this beautiful letter that was written by\nEinstein to his daughter, and was discovered,\nEinstein asked his daughter to wait 20 years until\nshe reveals these letters. And so she did. It's just one of the most\nbeautiful letters I've ever read from a father to his daughter. And the letter overall\nis imbued with a kind of a sense of remorse, or maybe even feelings of sadness. And there is some kind of\nmelancholy note in the letter where Einstein regrets not\nhaving spent enough time with his daughter, having\nfocused on, you know, the theory of general relativity\nand changing the world. And then he goes on to\ntalk about this beautiful and elegant equation of E = mc squared, and he tells his daughter\nthat he believes that love is actually the force\nthat shapes the universe because it is like gravity,\nright, it attracts people. It is like light. It brings people together\nand connects between people, and it's all-empowering. And so if you multiply\nit by the speed of light, you could really change\nthe world for the better. And call me a romanticist. I know you are too, which\nis why I so love being here. I believe in this. I totally and utterly believe in- - In love. By the way, let me just,\nexcerpts from Einstein's letter. \"There's an extremely\npowerful force that, so far, science is not found a\nformal explanation to. It is a force that includes\nand governs all others, and is even behind any phenomena\noperating in the universe and has not yet been identified by us. This universal force is LOVE.\" He also, the last paragraph in the letter, as you've mentioned, \"I deeply regret not having been able to\nexpress what is in my heart, which has quietly beaten\nfor you all my life. Maybe it's too late to apologize, but as time is relative,\"\nthat jokester Einstein, \"I need to tell you that I love you, and thanks to you I have\nreached the ultimate answer. Your father, Albert Einstein.\" - Yeah.\n- But that regret, \"I deeply regret not having been able to express what is in my heart.\" Maybe that's a universal regret, of filling your days with busyness. - Yeah.\n- And silly pursuits and not sitting down and expressing that. - But it is everything. It is everything. It is why I love that expression. And I forget who said this,\nbut I love my daughter more than evolution required, right? And I feel the same way\ntowards my other half. And I feel that when you\nfind that connection, everything and anything is possible, and it's a very, very, very magical, a magical moment. So I believe in love,\nand I believe in the one. - It might be the same thing,\nit might be a different thing, but let me ask you a ridiculously\nbig philosophical question about beauty. Dostoyevski said, \"Beauty\nwill save the world\" in \"The Idiot,\" one of\nmy favorite books of his. What is beauty to you? You've created, through this intersection\nof engineering and nature, you have created some\nincredibly beautiful things. What do you think is beauty? - That's a beautiful question. (laughs) - (laughs) Maybe it is\nconnected to the love question. I don't know.\n- It is connected to the love question, of course. Everything is connected\nto the love question. - [Lex] (laughs) Okay. - To me, beauty is agency. To me, something that has\nagency, it is beautiful. There is this special quote\nfrom Buckminster Fuller, which I cannot remember word-for-word, but I remember the concept,\nwhich goes something like this, \"When I work on a problem,\nI never think about beauty. But when I'm done solving the problem and I look at what I've created, and it's not beautiful,\nI know that I was wrong.\" - (laughs) Okay. Yeah.\n- It is kind of an agency that speaks to, quote unquote, the objective function\nof the creation, right? Whether for Bucky, it's useless or useful. - So this idea of empowerment\nthat you talked about. - Yes.\n- It's fundamentally connected to it.\n- Comes back to that, yeah. - What's the difference that you hinted at between empowerment and emergence? Is emergence completely lacks control? Is it, and empowerment is more controlled? There's an agent making decisions? Is there an interesting distinction there? - Yes. I think empowerment is\na force with direction. It has directionality to it. Emergence is, I believe,\nmulti-directional. Again, that depends on the application. Emergence is perhaps, in terms of sort of a material definition, is a tropic spirit, when empowerment is, the\nend is a tropic counterpart. I think they overlap, because I think that empowerment is a way\nof inspiring emergence. I think emergence does not\nhappen without empowerment, but empowerment can\nhappen without emergence. - Do you think of emergence\nas the loss of control? Like when you're thinking\nabout these capsules and then the things they create, is emergence of things that\nis not a desirable conclusion? - I love that question\nbecause, to some of us, the loss of control is control. In design, we're used to like\nextreme levels of control over form and the shape of a thing and how it behaves and how it functions. And that's something we've inherited from the industrial revolution. But with nature, there's this diversity that happens without necessarily having\na reward function, right? This is good or bad. Things just happen. And some of them happen to have wings and some of them happen to have scales and, you know, you end up with this incredible\npotential for diversity. So I think the future of\ndesign is in that soft control, is in the ability to design\nhighly controlled systems that enable the loss of control. And creativity is very much part of this, because creativity is\nall about letting go, and beginning again, and beginning again, and beginning again. And when you cannot let\ngo, you cannot be creative, and you can't find novelty. But I think that letting go is a moment that enables empowerment,\nagency, creativity, emergence, and they're all connected. They're sort of associate\nthemselves with definition of destiny or the inevitable. A good friend of mine shared with me, elegant definition of fate, which is the ratio of who you\nare and who you want to be. - Ratio of who you are and\nwho you want to be. (laughs) - Exactly, and that sort\nof ends up defining you. - Yeah.\n- And those tools, I think, when you let\ngo, you sort of find, you give peace to your will,\nright, to a sense of will. And so I think that's very, very important in design, but also in life. - She said this: Fate is the ratio of-\n- Who you are, and who you want to be.\n- Who you want to be. Do you think there's something to this whole manifestation thing, like focusing on a vision of what you want the world to become, and in\nthat focusing you manifest it, like Paolo Coelho said in \"The Alchemist,\" \"When you want something,\nall the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it\"? Is there something to that?\n- I think so, yes. And I always think of, you\nknow, what I do as this, the culmination of energy,\ninformation and matter and how to direct energy,\ninformation and matter in the design of a thing\nor in the design of a life. I think living is very much\na process of channeling these energies to where they need to go. I think that the manifestation, or part of that manifestation, is the pointing to the moon\nin order to get to the moon. And that's why manifestation\nis also directional. It has that vector quality to\nit that I think of agency as. - Have you, in your own life, has there been things you've done where you kind of direct that\nenergy, information and matter in a way that opens up-\n- New possibilities? - Yeah. I mean, you've also said\nsomewhere, I'm probably misquoting, that you're many things, you, Neri are many things, and you become new things\nevery 10 years or so. - Oh, I did say that somewhere. - Somewhere.\n- That every decade you sort of switch.\n- That was an old, that was a previous Neri\nthat said that. (laughs) - Yeah, I did say\nsometime ago that you have to sort of reboot every 10 years to keep creative and keep\ninventive and keep fresh. - Is there things you've done in your life where just kinda doors opened? - I think everything, everything. Everything good I've found in my life has been found in that way of letting go and suspending my sense of disbelief. And often you will find\nme say to the team, \"Suspend your disbelief.\" I don't care that this is impossible. Let's assume it is. Where does it take us? And that suspension of disbelief is absolutely part and\nparcel of the creative act. You know, I did so when I was in medical school, I was in Hadassah and in\nthe Hebrew University, and I remember I left medical school for architecture the day\nmy grandmother passed away, and that was a moment of relief. And that was a door that was closing that opened other opportunities. But that of course required letting go of the great vision of becoming a doctor, and letting go of the dream\nof, you know, being surrounded by wonderful patients and\nthe science of medicine and the research associated\nwith that science, and letting go of that\ndream to accomplish another. And it has happened throughout\nmy life in different ways. MIT was another experience like that where people pointed at me as, you know, the designer for whom\nthe academic currency is not necessarily the citation index. And of course, in order\nto get tenure at MIT, you have to look at the citation index. But for me, it was not that,\nit was manifesting our work in shows and writing\npapers and writing patents and creating a celebration\naround the work. And I never saw a distinction, you know, between those ways of being. I also think that another\nkind of way of being or a modality of being\nthat I found helpful is Viktor Frankl wrote\nthis incredible book, \"Man's Search for Meaning\"\nafter the Holocaust. And he writes, \"Different people pursue\nlife for different reasons.\" According to Freud, the goal\nof life is to find pleasure, and according to Adler it's,\nyou know, to find power. And for Viktor Frankl, it was about finding meaning. And when you let go of the\ntitles and the disciplines and the boundaries and the\nexpectations and the perception, you are elevated to this really special, yes, spiritual, but definitely\nvery, very creative plane where you can sort of start anew, look at the world through\nthe lens of a bacterium or a robot, or you know, or look at ecology through\nthe lens of chemistry and look at chemistry\nthrough the lens of robotics, and look at robotics through\nthe lens of, you know, microbial ecologies,\nand so on and so forth. And I feel that kind of\nrebooting, not every 10 years, but every minute, every breath is very, very important\nfor a creative life and for just maintaining this fresh mind. To reboot, reboot, to begin again with every\nbreath, begin again. And that can be confusing for some, right? For my team members, you know,\nI like to change my mind. It's who I am. It's how I think, it's how I operate.\n(bell rings) - Mm-hmm.\n- Do you want to... (laughs) You know, and they'll come, and we found another technique or another technology that's interesting and we thought that, you know, that we were working on this\nfunctionalized fragrance, but now there's another\nopportunity and let's go there. To me, I would much rather,\nyou know, live life, like if I had to pick sort\nof my favorite Broadway show to enter and live through,\nit would be \"Into the Woods.\" It's not a specific fairytale. It's not, you know, the Sleeping Beauty or Little Red Riding Hood or Rapunzel. It's all of them. It's sort of moving into the forest and seeing this wonder and getting close and learning about that, and\nthen moving to another wonder. And life is really about tying all of these little fairytales together in work and also in life. - Unafraid to leap into the unknown? - Unafraid to leap into the unknown. - Speaking of MIT, you\ngot a tenure at MIT, and then you leaped (laughs) to New York and started a new company with a vision that doesn't\nspan a couple of years, but centuries. (laughs) - I did. It was my destiny to start a company. - Yeah.\n- And do I have mornings when I wake up and I ask myself,\nwhat the hell am I doing? - Yeah.\n- Yes. I have those mornings. - [Lex] What do you do with\nthose mornings, by the way? - I embrace them and I find gratitude, and I say to myself, \"Thank goodness. I'm so lucky to, you\nknow, to have the ability to be frustrated in this way.\"\n- Mm-hmm. (laughs) So I really, really\nembrace these frustrations. And I take them, I wrap them in a bubble, and I look at it, you know, on the outside of my aware mind, and I laugh at them. I smile at them. (laughs)\n(Lex laughs) - If I could return, actually\nto the question of beauty for a second, I forgot\nto ask you something. You mentioned imperfection\nin the death masks. - Mm-hmm. - What role does imperfection play in our conception of beauty? What role does imperfection\nplay in nature? There's this Japanese\naesthetics concept of wabi-sabi, which basically embraces imperfection. Nothing lasts, nothing is finished and nothing is perfect.\n- Yeah. - What do you think of that? - I totally agree that change\nis the only permanence. That imperfection is there, if only to signal that we are part of a bigger thing than ourselves, that we are on a journey, that things are in movement. And if they were perfect, of\ncourse when things are perfect, it is just so boring. We end up with stereotypes. And as humans, but I\nthink just in general, as living beings, we're\nhere to find meaning, and that meaning cannot be\nfind found without struggle and without seeking, not to perfect, but to build towards something better. When I was a child, my\nmother, who I love so much, always explained to me how\nimportant it is to fall and to fail and to fight and to argue, and that there is a way, that there's a culture to failing and to imperfection. So I think it is necessary for something beautiful to be imperfect. (Lex laughs) And it is a sign that\nit is a sign of nature, because nothing in nature is perfect. - What about human relations?\nYou mentioned finding love. Are the flaws in humans,\nthe imperfection in humans, a component of love? Like what role do you\nthink the flaws play? - That's a really profound question. I think the flaws are there to, the flaws are there to\npresent a vulnerability. And those flaws are a sign of those vulnerabilities. And I think love is\nvery, very gentle, right? Love... With Bill, we often talk\nabout, between the two of us, about what drives all human behavior, and for him it's incentive, (laughs) as you might expect,\n(Lex laughs) and he will repeat this sentence to me, \"Oh, incentive drives all human behavior.\" - Mm-hmm.\n- But I would say, to me it's love, very much so, and I think flaws are part of that, because flaws are a sign\nof that vulnerability, whether physical, whether\nemotional vulnerability. And these vulnerabilities, they either tear us apart\nor they bring us together. The vulnerability is what is the glue. I think, I think that the\nvulnerability enables connection. The connection is the glue, and that connection enables\naccessing a higher ground as a community as opposed\nto as an individual. So if there is a society of the mind, or if there are higher levels of awareness that can be accessed in community, as opposed to, again,\ngoing to the silkworm, as opposed to on the individual level, I think that those occur through the flaws and the vulnerabilities. And without them, we cannot\nfind connection, community. And without community, we can't build what we have\nbuilt as a civilization, you know, for the past\nhundreds of thousands of years. So I think not only are they beautiful, but they have a functional\nrole in building civilizations. - Yeah. There's a sense in which\nlove requires vulnerability, and maybe love is the leap\ninto that vulnerability. - And I think yes, I think a flaw, think about it, like physically, I'm thinking about a brick\nthat's flawed, but in a way, I think of a flaw as an\nincreased surface area. (laughs) (Lex slaps) (Neri laughing)\n- That is a good line. That is a good line.\n- Right? A surface area that-\n- Hoo, that is a good line. - Like physically or emotionally, right? It sort of introduces\nthis whole new dimension to a human or a brick, and because you have more\nsurface area, you can- - Yeah. (laughs)\n- You know, use mortar, and build a home, and yeah,\nI think of it as accessing this additional dimension of surface area that could be used for good or bad, right? To connect, to communicate,\nto collaborate. It makes me think of that quote\nfrom this incredible movie I've watched years ago, \"Particle Fever,\" I think it was called. Documentary, about the\nLarge Hadron Collider, an incredible film where\nthey talk about the things that are least important for our survival are the things that make us human, like the pure romantic act\nor you know, the notion of... And Viktor Frankl talks about that, too. He talks about feeling the sun on his arms as he is working the soil in two degrees Fahrenheit without clothes. And the officer berates him and says, \"Well, what have you done? Have you been a businessman before you came here to the camp?\" And he says, \"I was a doctor.\" And he said, \"You must have made a lot\nof money as a doctor.\" And he said, \"All my\nwork I've done for free, I've been helping the poor.\" But he keeps his humility and he keeps his modesty, and he keeps his\npreservation of the spirit. And he says the things that\nactually make him able to, or made him able to outlive\nthe terrible experience in the Holocaust was the\nreally cherishing this moment when the sun hits his skin or when he can eat a grain of rice, a single grain of rice. So I think cherishing\nis a very important part of living a meaningful life, being able to cherish those simple things. - Like to notice them and to-\n- To notice them, to pay attention to them in the moment. And I do this now more than ever. - I mean, there is some, Bukowski has this poem\nlike called \"Nirvana,\" where it tells a story\nof a young man on a bus going through like North\nCarolina or something like this, and they stop off in a\ncafe and he has this, there's a waitress and just, he talks about that he notices the magic, something indescribable,\njust notices the magic of it. And he gets back on the bus\nwith the rest of the passengers. And none of them seem to\nhave noticed the magic. And I think if you just\nallow yourself to pause and just to feel whatever that is, maybe ultimately it's a kind of gratitude. - Yes.\n- For... I don't know what it is. It's just, I'm sure it's\njust chemicals in the brain, but it is just so incredible to be alive. - Yes.\n- And noticing that. - Yes.\n- And appreciating that, and being one in that with others. - Yes. Yes. And that goes back to, you know, to the fireplace, right,\nto the first technology. What was the first\ntechnology? It was fire. First technology to have built community. And it emerged out of a vulnerability, of wanting to stay away from\nthe cold and be warm together. And, of course, that\nfire is associated with, not only with comfort and the\nability to form, you know, bio-relevant nutrients in our food and provide heat and\ncomfort, but also spirits and a kind of a way to enter a, you know, to enter a spiritual moment, to enter a moment that\ncan only be experienced in a community, as a form\nof a meditative moment. There is a lot to be said about light. Light is, I think, an important part of these moments of... I think it's a real thing. I really truly believe that we're born with an aura surface\narea that is measurable. I think we're born into the world with an aura. And how do we channel that is really, sort of, I mean, ends up sort of defining, you know, defining the light in our lives. - Do you think we're all lonely? Do you think there's\nloneliness in us humans? - Oh yes, yes. Loneliness is part, yes. I think we all have that loneliness, whether we're willing to\naccess that loneliness and look at it in the eye, or completely, you know, completely avoid it or deny it. - It's like, it feels like it's this some kind of foundation for longing, and longing leads to this combination of vulnerability and\nconnection with others. - Yes.\n- And it feels like that's a really important\npart of being human, is being lonely.\n- Very. We are born into this world alone. Again, being alone and being lonely are two different things, right? And you can be together, but be lonely, and you can be alone,\nbut not be lonely at all. We often joke, Bill and I,\nthat he cannot be lonely. He cannot deal with being by himself. He always needs people around him, and I strive, long, must have creative solitude, must find pockets of\nsolitude and loneliness in order to find creativity\nand reconnect with myself. So loneliness is a recipe\nfor community, in my opinion. And I think those things\ncompliment each other. And they're synergetic, absolutely. The yin and yang of togetherness. And they allow you, I think, yeah, to reset and to tune in to that ratio we talked about, of who you are and who you want to be. - If you go to this place\nof creative solitude, what's your creative process? Is there something you've\nnoticed about what you do that leads to your, to good work? - I love to be able,\nnot only to lose focus, but kind of to focus\non the peripheral view, and to allow different\nthings to occur at once. So I will often, in my\nloneliness journeys, I will often listen to\nlike Leonard Bernstein, anything I can find\nonline by Lenny Bernstein. It's reading a Nature\npaper, it's \"War and Peace.\" It's really revisiting all the texts that are so timeless for me with opportunities that\nare very, very timely. And I think for me, the\ncreative process is really about bringing timeless\nproblems or concepts together with timely technologies, to observe them. I remember when we did\nthe Mandela Pavilion, we read \"Moby Dick,\" the whiteness of the whale, the albino, the different, the other. And that got us to work on melanin. And melanin also is sort of\nan output from the death mask. So it's lots of things\nhappening at the same time. And really allowing them,\nallowing them to come together to form this view about\nthe world through the lens of a spirit being, or a\nliving being, or a material, and then focus on the world through the lens of that material. The glasswork was another\nproject like that, where we were fascinated by glass, because obviously it's superb\nmaterial for architecture. But we created this new\nglass printing technology for the first time that was shedding light on the biomechanics of fluid glass, the math and the physics of\nwhich was never done before, which was so exciting to us,\nbut revealing new knowledge about the world through\ntechnology, that's one theme. The reincarnation between\nthings, material and immaterial, that's another theme. Lenny Bernstein, \"War and Peace,\" Tolstoy. - You tweeted a Tolstoy\nquote from \"War and Peace,\" as of course you would: \"Everything I know, I\nknow because of love.\" - Love, yeah. I love this quote. - So you use these kind of inspirations to focus you and then find the\nactual idea in the periphery? - Yes, and then connect them with whatever it is that we're working on. Whether it's, you know, high-throughput directed\nevolution of bacteria, you know, whether it's, you know, recreating that Garden\nof Eden in the capsule and what it looks like,\nthe food of the future. It is a little bit like directing a film, creating a new project is a bit like creating a film. And you have these heroes, you have these characters\nand you put them together, and there is a narrative,\nand there's a story. Whenever we start a new\nproject, it has to have these ingredients of\nsimultaneous complexity. It has to be novel in terms\nof the synthetic biology, material science, robotics, engineering, all of these elements that are discipline-based\nor rooted must be novel. If you can combine novelty\nin synthetic biology with a novelty in robotics, with a novelty in material science, with a novelty in computational design, you are bound to create\nsomething novel, period. And that's how I run the company, and that's how I pick the people. And so that's another very,\nvery important ingredient of the cutting edge across\nmultiple disciplines that come together. And then in the background,\nin the periphery, there's all these messages, the whispers of the ancient oldies, right? The Beethoven's and the Picassos and- - So Beethoven's always whispering to you? - Yeah.\n(Lex laughs) How could one not include\nBeethoven in the whispers? - I'm gonna ask you about\nBeethoven and the Evgeny Kissin that you've mentioned, 'cause I've played piano my whole life. I obviously know a lot of Beethoven, and it's one of the private\nthings for me, I suppose, 'cause I don't think I've\never publicly played piano. - By the way, me too.\n(both laugh) - I mean that-\n- I play in private only. (Neri laughs)\n- Yeah, people sometimes, even with guitar, people ask me, \"Well, can you play something?\" And it just feels like certain things are- - Are meant to be done-\n- Privately. - Yeah.\n- It's weird. I mean it's a difficult... and some of the times I\nhave performed publicly, it is it ultimate leap in vulnerability. It's very, very, very difficult, for me. And I'm sure it's, I know\nit's not for a lot of people, but it is for me. Anyway, we'll return to that, but since you've mentioned\ncombination of novelty across multiple disciplines\nand that's what you seek when you build teams or pick people you work with.\n- Yeah. Yeah. - I just wanted to kind\nof linger on this idea of (laughs) what kind of\nhumans are you looking for in this endeavor that you're taking on, this fascinating thing that\nyou've been talking about? One of the things somewhere\nelse, a previous version, version 5.7 of Neri said somewhere that there's four fields\nthat are combined to create this intersection of\nbiology and engineering work and it's computational design,\nadditive manufacturing, material engineering, synthetic biology. I'm sure there's others, but\nhow do you find these humans? Machine learning's in the mix? - I manifest and they come.\n- Yeah? - There are a few approaches.\n- You manifest? (laughs) - (laughs) They show up.\n- Okay. - You know, send your\nmessage upon the water. I mean, those job\ndescriptions that you saw, the first ones I wrote by myself, and you find interesting people and brilliant people when you look, we talked about second derivative. When you look under and under and under. And if you look deep enough\nand specialized enough, and if you allow yourself to look at the cracks, at the flaws, at the cracks between disciplines and between skills, you find really, really\ninteresting diamonds in the rough. And so I like for those\njob descriptions to, yeah, to be those messages in a bottle that bring those really\ninteresting people our way. I mean, they have to have humility. They have to have a shine in their eye. They have to be hungry and foolish. As Jobs so famously said, a friend of mine who's a dean of well-known\narchitectural school said, you know, \"Today architects\ndon't wanna be architects. Architects don't look up to the starchitects as role models. Starchitects are no longer role models. Architects want to build by\nvirtue of not building,\" right? Architects want, she said, \"We're back in the 60s when\nwe think about architecture, back in the hippie movement.\" I think that, in a way, they have to be somewhat of a hippie, somewhat of a kind of\njack-of-all-trades, master of all. - And yet with humility.\n- And yet with humility. Now, that is hard to find. And that is why, you know,\nwhen I start an interview, I talk about childhood memories, and I ask about music and\nI ask about connection. And through these interviews you can learn a lot about a person's\nfuture by spending time hearing them talk about their past. - Do you find that educational,\nlike PhDs versus... Like what's the life trajectory? Yours is an interesting life\ntrajectory, too. (laughs) Like what's the life trajectory that leads to the kind of person\nthat would work with you? - It's, you know, people who have, ideally had industry experience\nand know what it's like to be in the, quote unquote, real world. They're dreamers that\nare addicted to reality, as opposed to realists that\nare addicted to dreams. Meaning they have that innocence in them. They have the hunger. They have the idealism without being entitled and with understanding the\nsystems that govern our world and understanding how\nto utilize these systems as Trojan horses to bring\nthose values into the world. There are individuals who feel comfortable in this friction between, you know, highly wondrous and dreamy and incredible fantasy renditions\nof what the world could be with extremely brilliant skills in terms of their disciplinary background. So PhD with industrial\nexperience in a certain field, or a double major in two fields that make no sense whatsoever in their combination.\n- I love it. Yeah. - Are things that really,\nreally attract me. - And especially that span this, the technology biology gap.\n- Yes. The technology, biology, nature, culture. I mean, the secret to one thing is through the lens of\nanother, and I always believe in that kind of\ntranslational design ability, to be able to see something\nthrough the lens of another and always allows you to\nthink again, begin again, reestablish, redefine, suspend\nyour disbelief, revisit. And when you revisit enough\ntimes, like 100 times or like 200 times, and you\nrevisit the same question through the lens of\nany possible discipline and any possible scenario you find, eventually you get to the truth. - I have to ask you, because\nyou work at the interplay of the machine and the natural world. Is there a good definition\nfor you of what is life? What is a living organism?\n- Mm-hmm. I think like 440 million years ago, there were all these plants. That the cyanobacteria,\nI believe, actually, that was like the first extinction, right? There were six five extinctions. We are apparently the sixth, that we are in the eye of the storm, we are in the sixth extinction. We are going to be extinct as we speak. I mean, death is upon us, whether we want to admit it or not. And actually they found in\nArgentina and in, you know, various places around the world, they found these spores\nof the first plants that existed on the planet, and they emerged out of these\ncyanobacteria were the first, of course, and then they found\nthese spore-based plants. And because they didn't have\nseeds there, only spores, the spores became sort of the fossils by which we've come to\nknown of their existence. And because of these spores, we know that this first\nextinction existed. But this extinction is actually what enabled\nplants to redirect, right? So the death of these first plants, because they clinged to the rocks and they generated a ton of phosphorus that went into the ocean\nby clinging to the rocks, like 60 times more\nphosphorus than without them. And then all this pho phosphorus\nbasically choked the oceans and made them super cold\nand without oxygen, anoxic, and then we lost the plant kingdom. And then because of the\ndeath of these first plants, they actually enriched the soil and created nutrients for these new plants to come to the planet. And those plants had, like,\nmore sophisticated vein systems, and they were moving beyond\nspores to seeded plants, et cetera, and flowering plants. And so in a way, one mass\nextinction sort of led, in the Ordovician period sort\nof led to life as we know it. And where would we be\nwithout plants, in a way? So I think that death is\nvery much part of life, and through that definition, that kind of planetary-wide definition in the context of hundreds\nof millions of years, life gains a completely\nnew sort of a new light. And that's when the particles\nbecome a wave, right? Where humans are, we are not alone, and we are here because\nof those plants, right? So I think death is\nvery much part of life. So in the context of, you know,\nthe redwood tree, perhaps, you know, life is defined\nas 10 generations, and through the lens of a bacteria, perhaps life is defined as a millisecond, and perhaps through the lens of an AGI, life is defined as all\nof human civilization. And so I think it really is a question of this timescale again, the timescale and the organism, the life form that's asking the question through which we can answer, what is life? - What do you think about this? Since, if we think of ourselves\nas in the eye of the storm of an another extinction, the natural question to ask\nhere is you have all of nature, and then you have this new human creation that is currently being termed\nartificial intelligence. How does your work play\nwith the possibility of a future super-intelligent\necosystem and AGI, that either joins or supersedes humans. - Yeah, so I'm glad you\nasked this question. - And are you hopeful or terrified? - Both. I'm hopeful and terrified. I did watch your interview\nwith Eliezer Yudkowsky, and I loved it. - Because you were scared? Or because you were excited? Or because there was a\n(drowned out by Neri) - First of all, I was both. I was totally scared, ashamed, excited, and totally also inspired, because he's just such\nan incredible thinker. And I can agree or\ndisagree with what he says, but I just found his way\nof thinking about AGI and the perils of humanity as a result. - There's an inevitability\nto what he's saying. His advice to young people is\nthat prepare for a short life. - Yeah.\n- He thinks it's very almost simple. It's almost common sense that\nAGI would get rid of humans, that he can't imagine\na trajectory eventually that leads to a place that\ndoesn't have AGI kill all humans. There's just too many trajectories where superintelligent\nsystems gets rid of humans, and in the near term.\n- Yeah. - And so that clarity of\nthinking is very sobering. To me, maybe it is to you as\nwell, it's super inspiring. 'cause I think he's wrong, but it's like you almost\nwanna prove him wrong. It's like, no, we humans\nare a clever bunch. We're gonna find a way.\n- It is a bit like jumping into super cold water. It's sort of a kind of\na fist in your face. It wakes you up.\n- Yeah. Yeah. - And I like these moments so much. - Yes, yes, yes.\n- And he was able to bring that moment to\nlife, even though, I think, a mother can never think that way. Ever.\n- Yeah. - And it's a little bit\nlike that notion of, I love her more than evolution requires. On your question about AGI and nature, look, I think we've been\nthrough a lot in terms of, to get here, we sort of\nmoved from data, right? The ability to collect\ninformation to knowledge, the ability to use this\ninformation for utility, from knowledge to intelligence. And what is intelligence? It's the ability to problem\nsolve and adapt and translate. So that sort of from data\nto information to knowledge. I think the next frontier is wisdom. And what is wisdom? Wisdom is the ability\nto have or find insight about the world, and from wisdom to spiritual awareness, which is sort of transcends wisdom and is able and to chart the\nworld into new territory. But I think what is interesting about AGI is that it is sort of almost like a self-recursive thing, right? Because it's like a washing machine of like a third derivative Wikipedia. It uses kind of like\nlanguage to create language, to create language, to create language. - It feels like novelty's\nbeing constantly created. It doesn't feel like it's regurgitating. - And that's so fascinating\nbecause, you know, these are not the stochastic parrots. This is sort of a new form\nof emergence, perhaps, of novelty as you say,\nthat exist by virtue of using old things to create new things. But it's not as if the AGI\nhas self-awareness, right? It's not as if it has,\nmaybe, maybe, maybe. Maybe it has. But as far as I can tell, it's not as if AGI has\napproached consciousness or sentience just yet. It's probably getting there, but the language appears to present itself as if there is sentience\nthere, but it doesn't. But I think that's the problem. At the point where this\nAGI sounds like me, and speaks like me, and behaves like me, and feels like me, and breathes like me, and my\ndaughter knows the AGI to be me as sort of the end of everything, right, is the end of human agency. But what is the end of\nhuman agency to humans, I think, is the beginning\nof agency to nature. Because if you take all of this agency, if you take all of these language models that can summarize all\nof human civilization and consciousness and then\nupload that to nature, and have nature now deal with\nthat world of consciousness that it never had access to. So maybe through Eliezer's lens, the sort of short-lived human becomes sort of a very\nlong-lived human-like, sentient weeping willow, maybe?\n- Yeah. - Maybe that's the end and the beginning? And maybe on the more optimistic side, for us humans, it's a\ndifferent form of existence, where everything we create\nand everything we consume and everything we process is all made out of six, you know, six elements and that's it. And there's only those six\nelements, and not 118 elements. And it's all the stuff\nof biology plus some, you know, fair amount of bits, bits, genes and atoms. - Well, I think the idea-\n- A lot of Beethoven. - A lot of Beethoven.\n(Neri laughs) I think the idea of\nconnecting AGI to nature through your work is really fascinating. Sort of unlocking this\nincredible machinery of intelligence, that is AGI, and connecting it to the incredible machinery\nof wisdom, that is nature, as evolved through billions of years of pretty crazy intense evolution. - Exactly, and unlike sort of, again, I'm going back\nto directed evolution, unlike this sort of high-throughput,\nbrute-force approach, if there is a way to utilize this synergy for diversity and diversification, like yeah. Like, what happens if you ask a ChatGPT question and it takes 10,000 years\nto answer that question? Like, what does that look like, right, when you like completely\nswitch the timescale and you can afford the time\nto answer the question. And again, I don't know, but that world, to me, is possibly amazing. - Do you think there's... (laughs) Because when we start to think\nabout timescales like this, just looking at Earth, all\nthe possible trajectories it might take of this living\norganism that is Earth. Do you think there's others like it? Do you think there's other-\n- Planets. - Planets with life forms on them that are just doing their thing in this kind of way? 'Cause in what you're doing, you're directly playing with what's possible with\nlife, lifelike things. That kind of maps the question of, well, what kind of other\nthings are possible elsewhere? Do you think there's\nother worlds full of life, full of alien life out there? - I've studied the calculations\nthat point, you know, towards the verdict that\nthe possibility of life in, you know, in and around\nus is very, very low. We are a chosen planet in a way, right? There's water and there's\nlove. What else do you need? (both laugh) And that sort of (laughs) very peculiar juxtaposition of conditions,\nthe oxygen, the water, the carbon, again, is in a way, a miracle given the massive extinctions that we've been through as life forms. And that said, I cannot believe that there is no other life form. I want to believe more than I know that, yes, that there are\nlife forms in, you know, in the white fountain\nthat is the black hole, (laughs) right?\n(Lex laughs) That there are these life\nforms that are, you know, light years away from us that are forming other forms of life forces. - I'm much more worried about, probably the thing that you're working on, which is that there's all\nkinds of life around us that we're not communicating with. - Yes.\n- So there's aliens, in a sense, all around\nus that we're not seeing, that we're not talking to,\nthat we're not communicating. - Yeah.\n- Because that to me just seems the more likely situation. - That they're here.\n- That they're here, they're all around us.\n- Yeah. In different forms. That there is a connection, like, there's a thing that connects all of us, all of living beings across the universe, and like we're just beginning\nto understand any of it. - Yeah.\n- And I feel like that's the important\nproblem, is I feel like you can get there with\nthe tools of science today by just studying life on Earth. Unlock some really fundamental things that maybe you can start\nto answer questions about what is consciousness? Maybe this thing that we've\nbeen saying about love, but in, honestly in a serious way, and then you'll start to understand that there is alien life all out there, and it's much more\ncomplicated and interesting than we kind of realize.\n- Yeah. - As opposed to look into human-like, exactly human-like things. It's the variety of life that's possible. It's just almost endless.\n- I totally agree with you. I think again, define\nalien, right? (laughs) - (laughs) Yeah. Define\nintelligence, define life. - Right. And Marvin Minsky used to say, \"Intelligence is a suitcase word,\" right? It's a word so big, it's a\nword like sustainability, and it's a word like,\nyou know, rock and roll, and suitcase words are\nalways very, very dangerous. - Speaking of rock and\nroll, you've mentioned music and you mentioned\nBeethoven a bunch of times. You've also tweeted about you getting Kissin\nperformance and so on. What can you say about the\nrole of music in your life? - I love music. I always wondered why\nis it that plastic arts, meaning architecture and\nsculpture and painting, can't get us to cry and music\ngets us to cry so quickly and connect so quickly? There is something about music that it is, and no wonder that plants\nalso respond to music, but that is the top of the\ncreative pyramid in my opinion. - And it's a weird mystery that\nwe're so connected to music. Well, by the way, to push back, a good bridge will make me cry. - A good arch. It's true.\n(Lex laughs) And I will say when I\nvisited the Sagrada Familia, I had that kind of spiritual reverence towards that spatial experience\nand being in that space and feeling the intention in the space, and appreciating every little gesture. So it's true. It is\nthe universal language. It's the language of waves, right? It's the language of the waves, not the language of the particles. It is the universal language, I believe. And that is definitely one of my loves. - And you said that if you weren't doing what you were doing now, perhaps you would be a film director. So have to ask, what do you think is the\nbest film of all time? Maybe top three? - Yeah. Maybe \"The Godfather.\" - Godfather, okay.\n- \"The Godfather\" is definitely up there. Francis Coppola is one of my heroes. - Have you met him?\n- I have met him. Yes, yes, yes. I was very, very lucky. We were very lucky to work\nwith him on his new film, \"Megalopolis,\" which is\ncoming out, I hope, in 2024. And think about the cities of the future in the context of new materials and the unity between nature and culture. Godfather is definitely up\nthere, \"2001\" is up there. I would watch that film\nagain and again and again. It's incredible. The last scene in Odyssey 2001, that's, just watch the\nlast scene of \"2001,\" then listen to (indistinct)\nand then sort of, and then go the garden,\nand that's pretty much, you know, the end in the beginning. But that scene, that last\nscene from 2001 is everything. It says so much with so\nlittle, and it leaves... It's sort of the embodiment\nI believe, of ambivalence, and there's opportunity to believe in the beginning of humankind,\nthe end of humankind, the planet's child star or\nstar child of the future. Was there a death? Was\nthere an reincarnation? You know, that final scene, to me, is something that I go back to and study. And every time there\nis a different reading of that scene that inspires me. So that scene just... And then the first scene\nin \"The Godfather,\" still one of the best scenes of all times. Sort of a portrait of\nAmerica, the ideals and values that are brought from Italy and- - A family of loyalty of-\n- Yes. - Of values, of how different\nvalues are constructed? - Yes, loyalty, and the human spirit. And how Coppola celebrates\nthe human spirit through the most simple\ngestures in language and acting. And I think in Kubrick you\nsee this highly curated and controlled and manicured vision of creating a film. And with Francis, it's\nlike an Italian feast. (Lex laughs)\nJust like anything. - Yeah.\n- Anything can happen at any moment in time, and\njust being on the set with him is an experience I'll take\nwith me (laughs) to my grave. It's very, very, very special. - And you said music is also part of that, of creating a feeling in the movies? - Yeah, actually \"The Godfather,\" (sings) that tune.\n- Yeah. That makes me like emotional every time on some weird level.\n- Yeah. It's one of these tunes, I'm\nsure, that has, you know, if you play it to a jasmine, you'll get the best scent of all time. (Lex laughs)\nI think, like, there's, but I think with that particular\ntune I learned staccato. (Neri sings) Something very, very happy and joyous. (Neri sings) And then made into this stretched in time and became kind of the refrain of nostalgia and melancholy and loyalty and all of these values that ride on top of this one single tune. - You can play in all\nkinds of different ways. I've played it on guitar in\nall kinds of different ways. And I think in \"Godfather III,\" the son plays it on guitar to the father. I think this happens in\nmovies, but sometimes a melody, and that's a simple\nmelody can just like... - And the Strauss melody in \"2001.\" - Yeah.\n- And when you juxtapose these melodies with the scene, you get this, again, whole that's bigger than\nthe sum of its parts, where you get this\nmoment that is, I think, like these are the moments I would send, you know, with the next\nVoyager to outer space. I definitely sent The\nGodfather\" and \"2001\" would definitely be be\non that Golden Record. - You are an incredibly\nsuccessful scientist, engineer, architect, artist, designer. You've mentored a lot\nof successful people. Can you give advice to young\npeople listening to this, how to have a successful career and how to have a successful life? - Look, I think there's\nthis beautiful line in \"Sheltering Sky.\" How many times have you seen a full moon in your life and actually took the time to ingest (laughs) and explore and reflect upon the full moon? Probably 20, I believe he says. I spend time with a full moon. I take my time with a full moon, and I pay attention to a full moon. And I think paying attention to the seasons, and taking time to appreciate the little things, the simple things is what\nmakes a meaningful life. I was very lucky to have had, you know, to have grown up in a home that taught me this way of being. My parents, my grandmother, who played a very important\nrole in my growing up, and that ability to pay attention and to be present is so, so, so, so, I could not emphasize it\nenough, is so crucial. - And be grateful.\n- And be grateful. - Yeah.\n- I think gratitude and presence, appreciation, are really the most important things in life. - If you could take a short\ntangent about your grandmother, who's played a big role in your\nlife, what do you remember? What lessons have you learned from her? - She had this blanket\nthat she would give me every time I came back from\nschool and say, you know, do your homework here and\nmeet with your friends here, and it was always in her garden. And her garden in my mind was ginormous, but when I, you know, last I\nwent there and saw the site, which has now become the site\nfor another tall building. It was a tiny, tiny little garden that, to me, seemed so\nlarge when I was growing up, because it had everything. It had fig trees. it had olive trees. It had mushrooms. It had the blanket. I would do my homework there. It was everything, and\nI needed nothing else. And that was my Garden of Eden.\nThat was my childhood being. And she taught me, you know, we would lie on the blanket\nand look at the clouds and reflect upon the shapes of the clouds and study the shapes of the plants, and there was a lot of wonder\nin that childhood with her. And she taught me the importance of wonder in sort of in an eternal childhood and living adulthood as a child. And so I'm very, very grateful for that. I think it is the sense of wonder. The speaking up was always\nsomething that she adhered to, to speak up your truth, to be straightforward, to be positive. These are things that\nI also got from my mom. And from my mom, the sense of humor. She had the best sense of humor that I could think of and was just, just a joy to be around, and\nmy father taught me everything. My father taught me everything I know. My mom taught me\neverything I feel. (laughs) - [Lex] (laughs) That's\na good way to put it. - My grandma taught me\neverything I insight. - Well, I see the sense of wonder that just carries through\neverything you do. So I think you would, you\nmake your grandmother proud. Well, what about advice\nfor how to have a career? So you've had a very interesting career and a successful career,\nbut not an easy one. You took a few leaps. - I did take a few leaps,\nand they were uncomfortable. My father, and I'll never forget, (laughs) I think we were like listening to a Rolling\nStones song in the kitchen, and my dad, who was actually\nborn in Boston, he's American, he said... I started to have sort\nof these second thoughts about continuing my education in Israel, and I wanted to, you know,\ngo, I was on my way to London, to the Architectural Association to do my diploma studies there. And he looked at me and he\nsaid, \"Get out of here kiddo. You gotta get out of here.\" And you know, \"You've\noutgrown where you're at. You know, you need to move forward.\" Another thing he had taught\nme, the feeling of discomfort, as you, as you say, the feeling\nof loneliness and discomfort is imperative to growth. Growth is painful, period. Any form of growth is\ndifficult and painful. Birth is difficult and painful. And it is really, really\nimportant to place yourself in situations of discomfort. I like to be in a room\nwhere everyone in the room is more intelligent than me. I like to be in that kind of state where the people that\nI surround myself with are orders of magnitude\nmore intelligent than I am, and I can say that is true\nof all of my team members. And that's the intellectual\ndiscomfort that I feed off of. The same is true for physical exertion. You gotta put yourself in\nthese uncomfortable situations in order to grow, in\norder to find comfort. And then on the other hand is love, is finding love, and finding that, you know, that human, this\nother human that complements you and that makes you a better version of the one you are, and even of the one you want to be. But with gratitude and attention and love, you can go so far. To the younger generation,\nI don't speak of a career. I never thought of my\nwork as my career, ever. And there was this constant entanglement between life and work and love and longing and being and mothering. It's all the same. And I appreciate that to\nsome people that doesn't work you know, in their arrangement of will versus comfort versus the reality. But for me, it has always worked. So I think to the younger generation, I say, don't think of your career. A career is something\nthat is imposed upon you. Think of your calling. That's something that's innately and directionally moves you. And it's something that\ntranscends a career. Similarly, you can think\nabout the difference between, you know, learning versus being educated. Being educated is something\nthat's given to you, that's external, that's being imposed, that's top-down imposed. This learning is something\nthat comes from within. It's also the difference\nbetween joy and happiness. Many times I'm sad and I'm still joyous. And it's very, very important\nto understand the difference between these externally\nperceived success paths and internally driven, value-based, you know, ways of being in the world. And we together, when\nwe combine all of these, you know, all of these,\nthe broken puzzle, (laughs) let's say of substance and vulnerability, we get this bigger gestalt, this wondrous world of a future that is peaceful, you know, that is wholesome\nand that, you know, that proposes or, you know, advocates for that kind of synergy that we've been talking about throughout. But it's all fun. (laughs)\n(Lex laughs) - Well, thank you for this\nincredible conversation. Thank you for all the work you're doing. - Thank you, Lex.\n- And I just have to say that thank you for noticing\nme and listening to me. You're somebody from just today and from our exchanges before this. Like, there's a sense where you care about me as a human being, which I could tell you\ncare about other humans. Thank you for doing that. Thank you for having\nempathy and just like, yeah, really listening and\nnoticing me, that I exist. So thank you for that. Been a huge fan of your work, been a huge fan of who\nyou are as a human being. It's just an honor that\nyou would sit with me. Thank you.\n- Thank you so much, Lex. I feel the same way.\nI'll just say the same. - And I look forward to hearing the response to my job\napplication I've submitted. (Lex laughs)\n- Oh, you're accepted. - Oh, damn, all right. Excellent. - We all speak of you all the time. - (laughs) Thank you so much. - Thank you, Lex.\n- Thank you, Neri. - Thank you.\n- Thank you. Thanks for listening to this\nconversation with Neri Oxman. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with\nsome words from Leo Tolstoy, \"Everything I know, I\nknow because of love.\" Thank you for listening. I\nhope to see you next time."
