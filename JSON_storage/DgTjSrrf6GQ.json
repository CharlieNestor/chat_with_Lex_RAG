      "text": "- It is the most important\nright that Americans have. It's not a coincidence or an accident that it's named in the First\nAmendment to the Constitution. Without it, no democratic\nsociety can be democratic, for long. And I'm an absolutist. That is, I believe that, for\nexample, people say to me, \"But what about hate speech?\" Well, hate speech is much more\nimportant than love speech, and the reason is, I'm much\nmore interested in knowing whom I should not turn my back on, than I am interested in\nfiguring out who loves me. - The following is a conversation\nwith Harvey Silverglate, a legendary free speech\nadvocate, co-founder of FIRE, the Foundation for Individual\nRights and Expression, and the author of several books on the freedom of speech\nand criminal justice, including \"The Shadow University: The Betrayal of Liberty\non America's Campuses\". Harvey is running to be on\nthe Harvard Board of Overseers this year with a write-in campaign, so you have to spell his name correctly. Silverglate. Promising to advocate for free speech and to push for reducing the size of Harvard's administration bureaucracy. Election is over this Tuesday,\nMay 16th at 5:00 PM Eastern. To vote, you have to be Harvard alumni. So, if you happen to be\none, please vote online. It's a good way to\nsupport freedom of speech on Harvard campus. Instructions how to do so\nare in the description. As a side note, please allow me to say that since there are several\ncontroversial conversations coming up, I tried to make sure that this podcast is a\nplatform for free discourse, where ideas are not\ncensored, but explored, and if necessary, challenged, in a thoughtful, empathetic way. It's by having such\ndifficult conversations, not by avoiding them, that we can begin to heal\ndivides and to shed lights on the dark parts of human\nhistory and human nature. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description, and now, dear friends, here's Harvey Silverglate. You co-founded the Foundation for Individual\nRights and Expression, also known as FIRE. A legendary organization that fights for the freedom of\nspeech for all Americans in our courtrooms, on our\ncampuses and in our culture. So, let's start with a big question. What is freedom of speech? - First of all, the organization\nwhen I co-founded it, in 1999, was called the Foundation\nfor Individual Rights in Education. It focused on free speech issues on\ncollege campuses in academia. And only earlier this year did\nwe decide to expand our reach beyond the campuses,\nwhich is why the name, although the acronym, FIRE, remains, it's now the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. - [Lex] The E used to be education. - E used to be education,\nit's now expression. And we basically do a lot of\nthe cases the ACLU used to do. The ACLU now, they're a\nprogressive organization, rather than a civil\nliberties organization. And we've taken the role\nof dealing with free speech in the society generally, and now this is a particularly, and you are prone to censorship. Everybody thinks they're right\nand that people who disagree with them should not be\nable to voice their views. It's a very difficult period right now, both on campus and off campus. It's about as intolerant\nan era as I can remember. I'm gonna be 81, May 10th. I was born on Mother's Day, 1942. And I can't remember it being this bad. I was born during the McCarthy era. - [Lex] So that says a lot. - It sort of reminds me of that. - Well, let's start with almost\na philosophical question, a legal question, a human question. What is this freedom that\nyou care so much about that you fought for so\nmuch, freedom of speech? - It is the most important\nright that Americans have. It's not a coincidence or an accident that it's named in the First\nAmendment to the Constitution. Without it, no democratic society can be democratic for long. And I'm an absolutist. That is, I believe that, for\nexample, people say to me, \"But what about hate speech?\" Well, hate speech is much more\nimportant than love speech, and the reason is, I'm much\nmore interested in knowing whom I should not turn my back on, than I am interested in figuring out who loves me or who likes me. So, hate speech is most\nimportant, in my view, and yet, it's banned in,\nfor example, schools. It's unbelievable. Kids are not schooled into understanding the glory\nof the First Amendment, when schools say to them\nthey shouldn't say things that are gonna make somebody feel bad. The purpose of speech is to express honest views that people have. So, I believe hate speech is\nas important as love speech, and in my view, it's more important. - So it should be brought to the surface, rather than operate in the shadows? - Absolutely. Absolutely. - What is the connection\nbetween freedom of speech and freedom of thought? - Well, in a free society, thoughts start in the brain and then they come out the mouth. So, they are different\nends of the same spectrum. - So, to you, the censorship of speech eventually leads to a\ncensorship of thought? - Of course. Censorship of the mode by which other people\nknow what you're thinking. - So there's some aspect of our society, that thinking is done collectively, and without being able\nto speak to each other, we cannot do this kind\nof collective thinking. - Correct, and the theory\nis that, ultimately, out of speech comes truth. That isn't necessarily so, but I do think that when\nthere's free speech, better decisions are made, because people put their\nviews on the table in a frank, accurate way, and then those views mix together, and clash, and out of that, usually, comes the better decision. Not always, but usually,\nor more often than not. But if somebody is not allowed to sit at the table of decision making, then the decision making\nprocess is poorer, less robust, less diverse, and\nultimately less successful. - So can you elaborate on the idea of free speech absolutism? So... Hate speech can be quite painful to quite\na large number of people. Does this worry you?\n- Yeah. Living in a free society\nrequires that you expose yourself to some discomfort. You could call it pain. It's maybe emotional pain.\nIt's not physical pain. But it's the price we pay\nfor living in a free society. Every so often, we're insulted,\nwe're emotionally hurt. Think of the alternative. All the alternatives are worse. Nobody ever promised us a rose garden. We're lucky to be in a country\nthat has the First Amendment. It's also the most diverse\ncountry in the world, because of immigration. I mean, my grandparents\non my father's side came over from Russia, on my mother's side,\ncame over from Poland. I'm very happy that my\ngrandparents came in from Russia. I would not want to be in Russia today. I'd probably be sharing a cell with a Wall Street Journal reporter. So, I'm thankful that they came in, and this is a great country. It's got troubles right now,\nbut what country doesn't? And we've had, before we had a civil war, we had segregation. We had the decimation of the Indians. We're not perfect. But it's the best place in the world for somebody who values liberty. - So you don't think that hate speech can empower large groups that eventually will lead to physical action, to physical harm to others? - No, I don't. I think that we have\ndeveloped a culture in which it's understood that if you\ndon't like what you hear, you talk back. You write something. We don't punch each other.\nWe insult each other. Is insulting great? Well, I don't know. It's okay. I used to, as a kid in\nBrooklyn where I was born, I was born and raised in Bensonhurst, we used to say, \"Sticks and\nstones can break my bones, but names can never harm me.\" And it's absolutely true. It what was true when I was\nfive and it's true when I'm, I'm almost 81. So, I've lived a long\ntime, I've seen it all, and talking from experience,\nas well as theory. It's what happens when you reach your 80s. (Lex chuckles) - I read that you had this line that \"You cannot be protected from\nbeing called an asshole.\" - Correct.\n- (chuckles) Okay. - [Harvey] Especially\nif you're an asshole. - (laughs) Well, that's... But you don't have to be an\nasshole to be called an asshole. - [Harvey] That's correct. - And I think the internet\nhas taught me that. - Well, the internet has\nposed a particular challenge to free speech absolutists\nbecause some of the stuff that's on there is god awful. But I have no different\nrule for freedom of speech on the internet than I have\nin newspapers or in lectures or in classrooms, or\nconversations among people. - What do you think\nabout the tension between freedom of speech and freedom of reach? As it's kind of sometimes termed. So the internet really\nchallenges that aspect. It allows speech to become\nviral and spread very quickly to a very large number of people. - Yeah, well, you know,\nwe've had revolutions in the modalities of communication. After all, newspapers\nwere the first challenge. Radio and television\nposed a new challenge. The FCC tried, but ultimately gave up\nthe attempt to control obscenity, for example. And the Supreme Court\nhas been pretty close. The one thing that liberal and conservative supreme courts... Right now we're in a conservative era, due to Trump nominations. During much of my life,\nit was the Warren Court. It was William O. Douglas, Brennan. It was a liberal court. One thing they agree on is free speech. They don't agree on much else, but they do agree on free\nspeech and I think the reason is that they recognize that, well, my group is in the ascendance today, but it may not be tomorrow\nand I want to have objective, clear rules, so that\nwhen I'm in the minority, I'm able to voice my opinion. And so it's one of the few things that both sides of the political\nspectrum agree on. The only people who don't are the people way over on the right\nthat I call the fascists, and the people way over on the\nleft who are the communists. But with respect to most people\non the political spectrum, Republicans, Democrats,\nsocialists, libertarians, they agree on the primacy of free speech, because it protects them,\nwhen protection is needed. - So, to you, even on the internet, free speech absolutism should rule. - Yes. Nobody's gonna die. Remember, death threats are not protected. Nobody's gonna die. So, people are gonna be\na little bit insulted? That's the price you pay for\nliving in a free society. And it's a small price, in my view. Some people don't have as\ntough a hide as others? Well, then develop it. I don't mean to sound cruel, but you're living in a free society. Develop a tough hide. - So that's the cost of\nliving in a free society? - [Harvey] Yep. There's a cost. - The thing is that it\ncan really hurt, at scale, to be cyber bullied, to be attacked, for the ideas you express or\nmaybe ideas you didn't express, but that somebody\ndecided to lie about you, and use that to attack you. - Well, first of all,\nthere are some exceptions to the First Amendment. Libel and slander is an exception. Direct threats are an exception. If you say such and such,\n\"I will murder you.\" That is not lawful. If you say to somebody... If you say about somebody, \"Oh, you know. You beat your wife.\" That is not lawful, if in fact, the person knows you don't beat your wife. There are some limits. Defamation is one. Direct threats are another. So, the First Amendment is not absolute, but it's more absolute than\nit is in any other society, and it's pretty near absolute. For example, fraud. If you sell somebody a car, and you say, \"Oh, this is in great running shape, and in fact it's an old jalopy, and it's not gonna make it more\nthan 10 miles, that's fraud. That's not free speech. So, free speech is not absolute,\nthere are these limits, but they're very narrow,\nspecific categories of limits. - But there's gray area here, because, while legally you're not\nallowed to defame a person, in the court of public opinion, especially with the aid of\nanonymity on the internet, rumors can spread, at scale. Thousands, hundreds of\nthousands of people, can make up things about you. - You have to defend yourself. - [Lex] Using more speech. - Through freedom of speech,\nwe're big boys and girls. You have to defend yourself. In some societies, if you say something... Right now, if you say\nsomething nasty about Putin, you'll end up in the gulag. If you say something nasty about Biden, you end up in \"The New York Times\". Where would you rather be? - Well, let's talk about\nthe thing you've done for over 20 years, which is\nfight for the freedom of speech on college campuses. So, why is freedom of speech\nimportant on college campuses? - Well, it's important\neverywhere in the society, but it's most important\non college campuses. Why? 'Cause that's where we\neducate our young citizens. And if you are educated\nunder a notion that some dean can call you on the carpet, because you say something\nwhich is considered racist, or you can say something\nwhich is considered dangerous to social cohesion, then it's not a liberal arts college. The theory that I used in\n\"The Shadow University\"- - A book you've written.\n\"The Shadow University\". - [Harvey] 1998. - 1998. You were ahead of a lot of\nthese things, by the way. - I'm afraid that as a pessimist, I always saw the bad side of things. - \"Betrayal of Liberty\non America's Campuses: The Shadow University\". A book you co-authored with Alan Charles. - Yes, with one of my Princeton\nclassmates, Alan Charles, of course, who's now an emeritus professor of enlightenment history at\nthe University of Pennsylvania. I only taught for one semester\nand I can go into that later. The reason that I did not\ncontinue to teach in colleges. It was Harvard Law School. I taught a course in the mid-1980s. But in any event, the college campuses are\none of the most important for free speech because it's\nwhere people get education. And if you don't really\nget a good education, if certain points of view are\nnot allowed to be expressed, because education comes\nfrom the clash of ideas, and you then have to decide... This is how you become a thinking adult. You have to decide which\nideas make more sense to you, which ones you're gonna follow. The college experience is transformative. And if there is censorship on campuses, it's highly destructive of\nthe educational enterprise and ultimately to the entire society. We have, in the sciences, we have scientific method. Scientific method is you try experiments and you see which ones work\nand then you develop theories, based upon the results of experiments. Well, this is not much different from every other aspect of life. You have to entertain different\nviews on different subjects. You hear all the views\nand you make a decision as to which one's accurate\nand which one's not. So, the scientific method\nI apply to non-science, to history, to journalism. To all of these things. - So that scientific\nmethod includes ideas. Hateful ideas, also.\n- Correct. If you don't allow hateful ideas... I mean, when scientists do\nexperiments, nobody says to them, \"Oh, you know, don't do that experiment, because it would be very bad, if that turns out to be\naccurate, that outcome.\" That's not the way it works. Every point of view is\nthrown into the marketplace, whether it's science or\nwhether it's non-science. - And that includes the kind of ideas and the kind of discourse\nthat might actually lead to an increase in hate on campuses? - The First Amendment prohibits speech which is\nliable to produce imminent, imminent violence. - Yeah.\n- So, for example. The exception is yelling, falsely, falsely yelling \"fire\" in\na crowded movie theater. A lot of people misstate it. They say, \"Oh, the exception is yelling 'fire' in a movie theater.\" Well, if there's really a fire, you're performing a\nreal important function. - [Lex] They usually\ndon't mention that part. - But it's falsely yelling \"fire\". You could start a riot. People would be crushed trying to get out. So, that's one of the exceptions\nto the First Amendment, as the Supreme Court has defined it. There are very few exceptions. And defamation is an exception. I'm not a fan of that exception, frankly, but if you say something about somebody that has serious\nimplications in their life, in their ability to earn a living, if you accuse somebody\nof being a pedophile, when it's not true,\nthat person can sue you. My own view is, I think that's\nan unfortunate exception, but I'm not on the Supreme Court. I think that I'm with... A friend of mine was Nat Hentoff. Nat Hentoff who wrote for decades for \"The Village Voice\" in New York. He was a friend of mine. He was a free speech absolutist. And he wrote a fabulous book called, \"Free Speech For Me, But Not For Thee\". And he was an absolutist\nand I'm with Nat Hentoff. - Even on the defamation aspect. I agree with you in some sense,\njust practically speaking, it seems like that the best way in the\npublic sphere to defend against defamation is with more speech. - [Harvey] Correct. - And through authenticity,\nthrough authentic communication of the truth, as you see it. - Yeah, you know, at\ntimes, \"The Boston Globe\" has said something about me\nthat hasn't been accurate. They have invariably published\nmy letter to the editor. I'm also not bashful about getting\nin touch with the reporter. At the end of every column, they give the reporter's email address. And I know people say\nthat I have more access to the media than most people, but all that means is I get\ndefamed more than most people. - Can we also comment on, from the individual consumer of speech, there's a kind of sense\nthat freedom of speech means you should be forced to read all of it. Freedom of speech,\nversus freedom of reach. We, as consumers of speech, do we have the right\nto select what we read? - We do, and nobody can\nforce us to sit in a room and listen to a radio program\nthat we don't wanna listen to. Nobody can force us to read a\nbook that we don't wanna read. The whole motion of freedom\nof speech means that people have autonomy on their choices. - In order to form a complete\nmind and complete human being, there's a kind of\ntension of that autonomy, versus consuming as many varied\nperspectives as possible, which is underlying the\nethic of free speech. So, on college campuses, it seems like a good\nway to develop the mind is to get as many\nperspectives as possible. Even if you don't really want to. - Well, that is the theory. Academic freedom is supposed to be the highest\ndegree of free speech. - [Lex] Yeah. - You should be able to entertain all kinds of hateful, threatening ideas. And the way I put it is, there's something wrong\nwhen you can say something with complete abandon, without\nany fear, in Harvard Square. Whereas on the other side of the fence, you can't say it in Harvard Yard. It should be the opposite. And what happens is, universities, from the best to the worst, from the most famous to\nthe least well known, have been taken over by administrators. Administrators do not really\nsubsume academic values. They know nothing about the constitution. They know nothing about free speech. They know nothing about academic freedom. They feel that their job is to keep order. And so they develop speech codes, kangaroo courts to\nenforce the speech codes. And these are very dire developments. I wrote about them in \"The\nShadow University\" in '98, and tried to deal with them in 1999, when I started FIRE, co-started FIRE. I would fire... The reason I'm running currently for the Harvard Board of Overseers is what I'd like to do is convince\nthe Harvard Corporation, the so-called President\nFellows of Harvard College, the chief governing\nboard of the university with the real power. The Board of Overseers\nis a secondary body, but quite influential. To fire 95% of the administrators. It would have a salutary effect on the academics of the university. It would have a salutary\neffect on free speech and academic freedom. It would cut tuitions by about 40%. And it would create a\nwhole different atmosphere on the campus and the\nsame could be said of MIT, or any other place. I think administrators are a very bad influence on American\nhigher education. - Can you elaborate the\nintuition of why this thing that you call \"administrative bloat\" is such a bad thing for a university? - Well, first of all. Just in terms of the cost of maintaining. There are more administrators\nin American higher education than there are faculty members. The cost is enormous. Number two. They are inimical to the teaching enterprise and they feel that their\njob is to control things, to make sure there are no problems, and nobody's feelings are hurt. Being called before a dean\nbecause you said something that insulted somebody is\nsomething that shouldn't happen in American higher\neducation, yet it happens, because you have these\nadministrators who think it's their job to protect\npeople from being insulted. You insult a black student,\nyou insult a woman, there's a disciplinary hearing. Well, there shouldn't be. Black people are accustomed\nto being insulted. Jews are accustomed to being insulted. Women are accustomed to being insulted. And it's very good to\nknow who doesn't like you. It's useful. It's essential information\nto know who doesn't like you. If everybody is forced to say \"I love you\" and nobody can say \"I hate you\", you get a false view of\nwhat life is all about. - [Lex] Outside of the university. - Outside of the university. I mean, you do graduate, eventually. - And that's ultimately the\nmission of the university is to prepare you, to make\nyou into a great human being, into a great leader, that can take on the\nproblems of the world. - Correct. And you don't do it by treating\nyou like a little flower. - But what role does the university have to protect students? To women, African Americans. Anybody. Jews. Anybody who could be a\nvictim of hate speech. - They protect you from physical assault. If somebody physically assaults\nyou, then they get punished. But they shouldn't protect\nyou against insult, because that is a violation\nof academic freedom. The freedom of the\ninsulter, to insult you. And also, as I said, it's very useful to know\nwho doesn't like you. It's useful for the so-called victim. I think, as I said, I wanna\nknow who doesn't like me. It's as important to me as\nknowing who who likes me. - But do you also believe in\nthis open space of discourse that the insulter will eventually lose? - I think that's true. I think that the insulter, eventually, will wear out his or her welcome. I do, but I like to know\nwho the insulters are. - [Lex] 'Cause it gives\nyou a deeper understanding of human nature. - Yeah, and usually, by the way, my experience has been that\nthe insulters have generally not been as smart as the\npeople they've insulted. And that's probably one of\nthe reasons they insult them, because they feel inferior. I mean, I'm not trying to\nbe a psychoanalyst here, but a lot of the people\nwho are the haters are pretty low down on the intellectual scale. - Anyway. 95% of administration, you would fire. You're calling to fire\n95% of the administration. - Correct.\n- People should know. I think people that don't really\nthink about the structure, the way the universities work,\nare not familiar, I think, with the fact that administration, there's a huge bloat of administration. When you think about what\nmakes a great university, it's about the students,\nit's about the faculty, it's about the people that do research, if it's a research university. They don't think about the\nbureaucracy of meetings and committees and rules\nand paperwork and all that, and all the people that are involved with pushing that kind of paper, and there's a huge cost to that, but it also slows down and suppresses the beautiful variety that\nmakes a university great, which is the teaching, the\nstudent life, the protests, the clubs, all the fun that\nyou can have in a university. All the varied exploration, which you can't really\ndo once you graduate. - Correct.\n- It's the place. The university is a\nplace to really explore. - Mm-hm.\n- In every single way. So, let me just talk about\nthis important thing, because I'm very fortunate\nto have contacted you, almost by accident, in a very\nimportant moment in your life. You're running for the\nHarvard Board of Overseers. What is this board? How\nmuch power does it have? And what would you do, if elected? - Okay, first of all, I have a prediction that in about five years, they're gonna probably change the name, because \"Overseers\" reminds\npeople of the slavery era and we're in such a\npolitically-correct era now that the English language\nis being restricted. \"Corrupted\" is the way I put it. Because certain words are forbidden. We have some problems in this country, and I think a part of the\nproblem is the educational system has lost the sense of\nwhat academic freedom and free speech are all about. And I think it's essential that\nthe educational system begin to take more seriously what free speech and academic freedom really are! That's why I'm running for the\nHarvard Board of Overseers. - So, let me just linger on the role of the administration\nin protecting free speech. So what often happens and I\nthink you've written about this, is there's going to be\nmaybe a small number of hypersensitive students\nand faculty that protest. So, how does Harvard administration resist the influence of those\nhypersensitive protestors in protecting speech, in\nprotecting even hate speech? - Harvard has done fairly well, under the presidency of Lawrence Bacow. I have had a couple of\nmeetings with Bacow. I like Bacow. I have donated to Harvard a print of, my late wife took a picture of\nBob Dylan and Allen Ginsburg when \"The Rolling Thunder\nReview\" got to Harvard Square, and it's sort of an iconic photograph. She called it \"The Music\nLesson\", 'cause it's got Dylan teaching Ginsburg how to play the guitar. And I donated one of those to Harvard. It's hanging in Bacow's office. The new president, Claudine Gay, is not known for\nrespecting academic freedom and free speech. People have said to me,\n\"Well, give her a chance.\" Well, I'm willing to give her a chance, but she does have a record,\nand she's a bureaucrat. I don't think she believes in free speech and academic freedom. I think she's a\nprogressive, not a liberal. I'm not happy with the appointment of Claudine Gay, and it has made more essential my attempt to get on\nthe Board of Overseers. - So, let's talk about\nthe Board of Overseers, and your run for it. The specifics, actually.\n- Okay. - It'll be nice because I think\nyou're a write-in candidate and the election is over on May 16th? - [Harvey] Yes. - And I think there are specifics. I'll probably give them in the intro. I'll give links to people but\nthe specifics are complicated. Let me just mention that you\nhave to be Harvard alumni. So have graduated from Harvard. - [Harvey] You have to in order\nto run and in order to vote. - In order to vote. And the process, I imagine\nis not trivial, but, this is done online and\nif you're an alumni, you should have received an email from a particular email address, harvard@mgelectionservicescourt.com. And presumably there's a way\nto get some validation number from that email and then you go online, you enter that validation\nnumber and you vote and to vote for Harvey,\nyou have to enter his name, correctly, Harvey Silverglate,\nand spell it correctly. Obviously I'm imagining this,\nbecause I'm MIT, not Harvard, so I'm imagining the\nprocess is not trivial, 'cause you have to click\non things, you have to follow instructions that are not trivial. And I'll also provide an email\nif the process is painful, it doesn't work for you, that you can email Harvard and complain. IThelp@Harvard.edu and so on. I'll provide all the links. But is there something else you can say about the voting process,\nwhat you're running on? - This is my second run. The first time, I got enough signatures to get on the ballot. Then the Harvard Alumni Association sent out a letter to all living Harvard alums, recommending that they vote for the officially-nominated candidates. That excluded two petition\ncandidates, of whom I was one. And I wrote to the Alumni\nAssociation and I said, \"You have now sent out\nthe curriculum vitaes, and the policy positions of all the officially-nominated\ncandidates. There are two petition\ncandidates on the ballot. I would like to be able to send out my positions to the voters. They wrote me back saying, \"Our policy is to only send\nout the policy positions and the platforms of\nofficially-nominated candidates.\" Can you believe that? Well, this is a liberal\narts college, right? Where, from the clash\nof ideas, truth emerges. Well, really? This is what I call\nHarvard's not-so-subtle means of candidate suppression,\nnot voter suppression. Candidate suppression. And everybody can vote,\nbut not everybody can run. Ill becomes a liberal arts college where the clash of ideas\nwill produce the truth. Well, what about the clash of ideas of the Board of Overseers? The Board of Overseers is important. It doesn't have the\nsame power or authority as the Harvard Corporation, the so-called President and\nFellows of Harvard College. But it's very influential\nand very important and it would be a great perch for me to try to exert influence for\nthe university to get back to where it was before it was taken over by the administrators. - Well, I'm pretty sure\nthat most of Harvard alumni, most of the students\ncurrently going to Harvard, most of the faculty at Harvard, probably stand behind the ideas and the ideals that you stand behind. - [Harvey] Yep. - The people that love Harvard\nand what it stands for. - The alumni were educated in an era when these concepts were\ntaken more seriously and before the administrators took over. So, I do think if I get my message out, I'm gonna win a seat. And if I win a seat, I\nwill have a great perch for trying to convince\nthe real power that be, which is the Harvard Corporation, to do the things that I'm suggesting. Get rid of 95% of the administrators, get rid of their speech\ncodes, reduce tuition by 40%. All of these salutary benefits. Can you imagine if Harvard became the most affordable college\nin the United States? - Well, the affordability\nis another aspect, but I think before that, just\nthe freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom of thought at America's greatest\nuniversities, I think, is something that\neverybody would agree on. - [Harvey] It would\nhave a tremendous effect on the whole country. - And is there something\nto say about the details of how difficult it is for alumni to vote? Do you have experience with this? - You could vote online or\nyou can vote by paper ballot. You could request a paper ballot. And all I could say is that the hard part is getting the message out. My name doesn't appear on the ballot, 'cause I couldn't get enough signatures. - Well, Harvey, Harvey Silverglate. - S-I-L-V-E-R-G-L-A-T-E. When my grandparents arrived from Russia, the name in Russia was\nsomething like Zilbaglit, and the immigration officer\nhad several choices. He could have said\nSilvergate. Gate is a real... Silver and gate are real English words. He could have said Silverglade. G-L-A-D-E. Those are real English words. That's how my name is often misspelled. Either Silvergate or Silverglade. Silverglate is a nonsense syllable. And why the immigration officer chose to transliterate Zilbaglit as Silverglate, I'll never understand, and it is the cause of\nendless mistakes in my name. - [Lex] Well, the the\nfundamental absurdity of life is also the source of its beauty. - Yes. - Anyway. We shall spell it out and we shall yell loud and wide that everybody who has\never graduated from Harvard should vote for you, if\nthey believe in the ideals of the great American universities, which I think most people do. Let me also ask about diversity, inclusion and equity programs. You've had a few harsh\nwords to say about those. The idea of diversity, I\nthink, is a beautiful ideal. You've said that Harvard's\nidea of diversity is for everyone to look\ndifferent and think alike. - Correct.\n- Can you elaborate? - And be comfortable. - And be comfortable.\n- Yeah. First of all, it is impossible, if liberal arts education\nis taken seriously, it's impossible for students\nto feel comfortable. Why? Because one of the roles\nof college is to challenge all the beliefs that they grew up with, which mostly are the beliefs inculcated by parents and by\nelementary school teachers. And the idea is to be able to challenge those thoughts, those ideas. And if you don't have free\nspeech and academic freedom, those views get reified,\nthey do not get challenged. It violates the fundamental\nrole of higher education institutions to have\nany restrictions at all. That's number one. Number two, as I think I said earlier, if students are not allowed\nto be frank with one another, they don't really learn about one another. I've given a lot of lectures\nin which I have said, and I think students now understand it, I'm much more interested in hearing from the people who hate me\nthan the people who love me. I'm much more interested in\nknowing who disagrees with me than people who agree with me. That's how I learn, and that's how they learn. The clash of ideas, which is the theory behind\nthe First Amendment. That truth will somehow\nemerge, or if not truth, at least a better truth, a truer truth, a more useful truth, if\nideas are allowed to clash. - Especially in the structure\nof a university where at least I would say\nthere's some set of rules, some set of civility. I think I would rather read \"Mein Kampf\" to understand people that hate. There is also a quality to disagreement that we should strive for. And I think a university is a\nplace where when disagreement and even hate is allowed, it's\ndone in a high effort way. - Somebody asked me once about what books would have as required\nreading in literature courses, and I listed \"Mein Kampf\",\nand they were horrified. And I said, \"Well, it's one\nof the most important books of the 20th century.\" I mean, six million Jews died, enormous number of other people died, because one guy wrote a\nbook called \"Mein Kampf\", and took it seriously. It's one of the most\nimportant books ever written. How can an educated person not have at least breezed\nthrough \"Mein Kampf\"? - It's not a great read, though. - It's not a great read.\nHe was not a great writer. But you do get a sense for the sociopath that was Adolf Hitler. - Yes, because he really acted\non the words that he wrote. - [Harvey] Yeah. - And it was there, and if\npeople took that work seriously, they would've understood. - It's one of the most important\nbooks of the 20th century, and it's politically incorrect to read it. It's crazy. - But can you speak to the efforts to increase\ndiversity in universities, which I think is embodied in\nthis D-I-E effort of diversity, inclusion and equity programs. Where do they go right?\nWhere do they go wrong? - Okay, let me tell you, first of all. This may surprise a lot of people. I am opposed to affirmative action. And I think that what it does is it labels people by their race, by their religion, and by their national origin. Precisely what we don't want people to do is be pigeonholed in those categories. The reason that affirmative\naction has become the way that universities\ndecide on who gets admitted is because, historically, people in what's called\n\"marginalized groups\", Blacks, gays, Hispanics, have been discriminated against,\nin the admissions process. Now, what I have suggested is that instead of affirmative\naction, and by the way, here's a prediction. The Supreme Court is going to\nabolish affirmative action. There's a case pending, this Harvard case. There are two cases joined together. One of a public university and\none of a private university. The private university is Harvard. I predict that the Supreme\nCourt will vote six to three to abolish affirmative action. On its face, it is a violation of equal protection of the law. Some groups are favored\nbecause of race or ethnicity. It is a classic violation\nof equal protection clause. When affirmative action was approved, the deciding vote was\nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor. She wrote a very famous\nopinion in which she said, \"I am hesitate to vote\nto affirm the notion of affirmative action\nbecause it's such an obvious violation of equal protection. But we have an urgent\nproblem in the society. We are not educating our members of racial and ethnic minorities, and we have to try to get\nthem into our colleges. So, I think it should be\napproved for 25 years. In 25 years, it should\nhave performed its role.\" Well, it hasn't. And the 25 years is coming up. I think it's three or four years left. The Supreme Court is going to abolish it. You can take my word for that. 'Cause it is such an obvious\nviolation of equal protection. Why did affirmative action come into play? Because the secondary in\nelementary schools were so bad. Public, secondary and\nelementary schools were so bad. Why are they so bad? Partly because of the control\nthat the teachers union has. Randi Weingarten runs\nthe public school system in the United States. And what I have suggested is that the effort should be to... This is a national emergency, to improve the quality of elementary\nand secondary education. And one way to do it is to hire teachers who are fabulous teachers, rather than necessarily\nmembers of the union. I have come to oppose public workers unions. I am a very strong supporter of unions in the private sector. Why do I think there's such\na difference between unions in the public sector\nand the private sector? In the private sector,\nmanagement is arguing, bargaining with its own money, and with the money of shareholders. In the public sector,\nthere's only one side. There is the teachers union, and then there's a school\ncommittee that is dealing with the taxpayers' money, not their own. And so it's a very skewed power balance. So, as supportive as I am\nof private sector unions, I am in opposition of\npublic sector unions. They're very destructive. And I think without teachers union, teachers who are really skilled\nwill be able to get jobs. They would not have to worry\nabout the seniority of teachers who long since have given\nup really creative teaching. And we have to improve the\npublic educational system. My late wife and I had a classmate of, we\nhave a son who's now 44, who went to the public\nschools in Cambridge. He has a friend, first name Eugene, who was a Black kid from\nRoxbury, whose mother understood that the schools in Roxbury were terrible, the schools in Cambridge were pretty good. He lived in our house, Monday to Friday, and he\nwent to school with Isaac in the Cambridge public schools. Elsa and I would show up to\nschool committee meetings when there was bargaining\nbetween the teachers union and the school committee. The teachers union objected\nto our being there. We argued, we're taxpayers.\nWe have a kid in the school. His best friend lives with us\nand goes to school with him. We have a real interest. The school committee walked\nout of the bargaining session. The city council then\nreconsidered its vote and they voted that citizens, taxpayers, parents of kids in the school, could not show up to these\nnegotiation sessions. I thought that was absolutely outrageous. But I understood why, because\nthese contracts are crazy. No sane municipality should enter into some of these contracts. And so, I have become an opponent of the National Teachers Association, the Cambridge Teachers Association. I don't think there should be\nunions for public employees because there's no real\nbargaining going on, and I think that the public school system will never be improved, as long as the teachers are unionized. - So that, to you, is at\nthe core of the problem that results in the kind of\ninequality of opportunity that affirmative action\nis designed to solve. - If the educational\nsystem in the elementary and high school levels is improved, we wouldn't need affirmative action. These kids would get good educations. - So, from all backgrounds, poor kids in the United States\nwould get good education, if public unions are abolished. - [Harvey] Correct. - But do you- - [Harvey] And incidentally,\nthe postal service would probably work better, too. (Lex chuckles) - That's a whole other conversation. But do you, at the core of\nthe problem of the inequality in universities, that diversity, inclusion\nand equity programs they're trying to solve is\nthe public education system. - Correct.\n- Secondary education. - [Harvey] Yes, correct.\nElementary and secondary. - Elementary and secondary education. - Well, then is there\nuse? What is the benefit? What is the drawback of D-I-E, diversity inclusion and equity programs, at universities like Harvard? - It's an affirmative action, basically. And what it does is it allows\nthe system of elementary and secondary education to be bad, because they could say, \"Oh,\nwe got our kids into Harvard.\" Yes, but you haven't educated them. And it covers up the wound. And I think we will never improve, as long as we're able\nto cover up the wound. And as I said, affirmative\naction is gonna be abolished by the Supreme Court. It's a clear violation\nof equal protection. It's what Sandra Day O'Connor\nunderstood, but ignored, intentionally, but as an experiment. And I believe it's gonna be abolished. That that's gonna force the elementary and high\nschools to get serious. - Do you see the same issues\nthat you discuss now at Harvard at MIT? We're here in Boston,\nso I have to talk about the great universities here in Boston. You've written about MIT. It's the university I love.\nI'm a research scientist there. Do you see the same kind of issues there? - Yes, I do. - Do you remember or\ncan you explain the case of Dorian Abbot lecture\nthat was canceled at MIT? - Yeah, well, this is not the only... It's not the only incident. There have been incidents\nall around the country of academics, professors who have used, that don't comport with the,\nas the great Lillian Hellman, another friend of my late wife, said, she said she refused to cut her garments, in order to fit the fashions of the day. Dorian Abbot didn't cut his suit to fit the fashions of the\nday, his intellectual suit. And so this has happened at Princeton, this has happened at Harvard,\nthis has happened at MIT. The great universities in\nthe country have decided that the clash of ideas\nis not such a good idea, because some people's\nfeelings will be hurt. Well, there was quite a revolt against it. FIRE sounded the alarm. And then, in the end,\nthe universities were, I believe Abbot was invited to come back. I think he turned them down. He shouldn't have turned\nthem down, but he did. And when the light is cast\nupon these situations, the universities back down,\n'cause they're so embarrassed. - [Lex] Yeah. - And the newspapers,\nbecause newspapers depend on the First Amendment in order to exist, newspapers tend to give\npretty good publicity to these cases of censorship. - [Lex] So they grill the universities. - Yes. - [Lex] So they really emphasized, they catalyzed the embarrassment. - Yes. - [Lex] So is that one of the ways, is that the best way to fight all of this? - Yes. Sunshine is the best disinfectant. - You've written about MIT's\nconnection to Jeffrey Epstein. He was well connected\nat MIT and at Harvard. What lessons do you\ndraw about human nature, about universities, about\nall of this from this saga? - Let me say this. I believe that universities, if somebody was to, for\nexample, donate to a university and donates on the requirement that the building be named after them. If the university is taking donations and the person is funding a building, and wants the building named after them, the building should be named\nafter him, her or them. Harvard is facing this now\nwith the Sackler building because the Sacklers have become, now, a persona non grata because of their role in producing the opioids that caused huge, scandalous opioid addiction. There are people who want\nto remove the name Sackler from the Sackler Art Museum at Harvard. Larry Bacow, the President\nof Harvard, to his credit, has refused to do that. And if it reminds people\nthat the money was earned through selling opioids, that's good. That's good that people understand that that's where the\nSacklers got their money. They should be re reminded. In my undergraduate alma mater, Princeton, there's a movement to remove\nthe name Woodrow Wilson, because Wilson was president at Princeton, before he became governor of New Jersey, before he became President\nof the United States. How he got to be Governor\nof New Jersey was, he was so insufferable that\nthe trustees of Princeton got him the nomination to run\nfor Governor of New Jersey. They had said, \"We gotta\nget this guy outta here.\" And not 'cause he was\nanti-Black and anti-Semitic, 'cause the trustees were, as well, but because he just was insufferable, he drove the faculty crazy\nand they got him out. And so Princeton was thinking\nof changing the name. I wrote a letter to President\nEisgruber at Princeton saying, \"This is part of the university's history. You don't wanna... You wanna rewrite history falsely? Woodrow Wilson was the\npresident of this institution. He was one of your predecessors.\" He never answered me, either. I think these people, they\nknow they have no answer. The reason I didn't get a\nresponse from President Eisgruber is the same as the reason\nI didn't get a response from the headmaster of Milton Academy. They understand that what\nthey're doing is violative of the fundamental precepts\nof academic institutions. They're ashamed, yet they feel\nthey have no choice because they feel that they would\nbe criticized for racism, homophobia, blah, blah,\nblah, blah, blah, blah, blah. - [Lex] Criticized by how many people? - Well, they feel that they\nwould be criticized by students and parents and donors. I disagree with that. I actually think there\nare more people out there that agree with me than agree with them. - Yeah, by a large margin. - By a large margin, in\nwhat I call the real world, which is the world outside the campus. But academics are afraid\nthey'd be criticized. They're incredibly thin skinned. When I say academics, I mean\nacademic administrators. They're very thin skinned,\npolitically correct. Holier than thou. As I said, I would fire 95% of them, and I would be more\ncareful in who I elected to lead these institutions. So, I said Claudine Gay is probably gonna be a disaster at Harvard. - So it takes guts, it takes courage, to be in the administration when the task of protecting\nthe freedom of speech is there. And also, which in part requires you to admit and to uphold the mistakes you have done in the past. - Correct!\n- Not to hide them. - [Harvey] Correct. - And that, to you, I mean,\nJeffrey Epstein for Harvard, and for MIT is a very recent mistake. - Well, there's a debate\nwhether it's a mistake. They took money from him. - Yes.\n- Okay. Is it a mistake to take\nmoney from bad people? Do you have to do a morals\ntest of a potential donor? I don't think so. - It's complicated because- - If there are no\nconditions attached to it, I think it's emotionally complicated. I don't think that it is\nrationally complicated. It's emotionally complicated. It's particularly complicated\nif they want naming rights. \"The Jeffrey Epstein\nBiological Laboratory\". That would be a problem\nfor most universities. I don't think that naming\nrights have to be given to somebody that you don't think is worthy of having their name. I think the university\nhas the right to say, \"No, we'll take your\nmoney, but we will not name the building after you.\" I think they have a right to do that. - There's some degree in which you whitewash the name, though. Not with naming rights, but... - [Harvey] If you take the money? - If you take the money,\nit allows the person, in public discourse to say\nthat they're collaborating, they're working together\nwith Harvard and with MIT. - Well, I have a problem with universities making morals tests of donors, because not every donor\nis as bad as Epstein, but some of the donors made\ntheir money in industry, by being rapacious, by paying low wages, by exploiting people. - You can make the case that accepting money from the\nDepartment of Defense, from DARPA, from the United States\norganizations that contributed to waging war and killing\nhundreds of thousands of civilians over the past few decades. - [Harvey] Correct. - Folks like the tenured\nprofessor Noam Chomsky will make the case that is far more evil than accepting money from Jeffrey Epstein. - [Harvey] Yes. - Still, Jeffrey Epstein\nis a known pedophile. - Yes. So, that's why I say I would\nnot give him naming rights. I think the university has the autonomy to not give naming rights, but I think that giving\nmorals tests to donors is a Pandora's box. - What do you think about the aftermath of the Jeffrey Epstein saga? It feels like... I'm not familiar with Harvard's response, but MIT's response seemed to fire a few scapegoats and it didn't seem like a genuine response to the evils that human\nbeings are capable of. Sort of like rising to the surface, the description in a fully transparent way of all the interactions that\nhappened with Jeffrey Epstein and what that means. Yeah, what that means\nabout the role of money in universities, what\nthat means about just human beings in power. - Money is essential to run a university. One of the reasons it's essential\nis because the university is artificially, artificially requires\nhuge amounts of money, and that's partly because\nof the administrative army that they support and they would be less dependent\non the Jeffrey Epsteins of the world if they didn't have... So, it's sort of all\npart of the same circle. - But there's a tension here. You're saying we shouldn't be putting a morals test on money,\nbut actually if you make, if you expand the amount of money needed to run the university, you're going to make less and less, more and more unethical\ndecisions in terms of accepting- - And as I said, I am\nflexible enough to say that I don't think I would\nname a building after somebody who was truly evil. I think university has the right to limit the naming rights for a donor. If I was an absolutist, I\nwould not even say that, but I'm not an absolutist. I have my limits. And that's one of them. \"The Jeffrey Epstein\nBiological Laboratory\". It's a little bit much. - It feels like there\nshould be moral requirements on who to accept money from,\nbut the concern you have was about who gets to decide\nand what's the alternative? - Correct. I think\nthere is no alternative. I think that turning down a donation because you don't approve\nof the conduct of the donor is a Pandora's box. (Lex breathes deeply) - But I'm just sickened by the\nfact that an evil human being was allowed to walk in the\nhalls of a university I love. So, what do we do with that? - Well, are you telling me that none of the students are evil? Are you telling me none of\nthe faculty members are evil? Are you telling me some none\nof the administrators are evil? - But that doesn't... Sure, sure. So, scapegoating saying\nthat Jeffrey Epstein is evil can help us forget, can\naid us in forgetting that there is other evil\nin the world and some of it might be roaming, still, the\nhalls of MIT and Harvard. - Hey, listen, I won't tell you the name, but I represented somebody\nin the MIT administration a few years ago who is charged\nwith sexual improprieties against students. And as a lawyer, I\nrepresented that person. People said, \"How could you represent...\" Some of the people I\nrepresent are bad people. Say, \"How can you represent?\" I said, \"Well, if I was a cardiologist and this person had a\nheart attack on the street and I didn't deliver CPR, I would have my license taken away.\" I'm a lawyer. The only difference between my obligation and the doctor's obligation\nis the constitution gives people the right\nto assistance of counsel. The Constitution says nothing about the assistance of cardiologists. I have a very high duty to\nrepresent unpopular people. Well, I think I apply the same\ntest to the college donors. The university should\nnot have a morals test to whose money to take. I do draw a line about\nnaming rights of buildings. And as I say, that's an\ninconsistency with my absolutism. But I just, emotionally, I\njust can't deal with having, as I said, \"The Jeffrey\nEpstein Biological Laboratory\". - Well, for me emotionally,\nthere's nothing that sickens me more in the university\nthan the abuse of power. - [Harvey] Right and there's\nan awful lot of people who abuse power at the university. - And especially when it comes\nto abuse power over students. So, sexual harassment. So, in the realm of sexual abuse of power, and all kinds of other. - Well, it is a crime to\nuse one's power position, in order to take sexual\nadvantage of a student. It's a crime.\n- Yeah. - This is not a closed question. - Yeah, but there's a legal crime, and there's a deeply ethical crime, and there's an emotional\nresponse that I have. You are a good lawyer and perhaps a\ngood man to want to defend some folks who are evil in this world. I don't think I have\nthat emotional fortitude. - [Harvey] Well, then you shouldn't be a criminal defense lawyer,\nor a cardiologist. (laughs) - I think you're right. (both laugh) I'm still deeply sickened\nby Jeffrey Epstein and the faculty, the administration that still might be in these\ngreat American universities that are abusing their power,\nin small ways and big ways. But that's human nature. You get a little bit of power, and you're a bad man or a bad woman, and you take advantage of it. - [Harvey] Yep. - We see that in the smallest of ways, and in the biggest of ways. In institutions and regimes,\nall across the world. (sighs) Boy. Harvey, it's a complicated situation. - Well, it's a complicated world, and it's complicated to be a human being, and this is nothing new. - And we should talk about\nit, without restriction. All right. Just to linger on liberal arts. In 2014, and probably still today, you wrote that liberals are\nkilling the liberal arts. - Yes.\n- So can you explain? - Yes. I'm a political liberal. The problem with the political left is that it has divided between what's called\n\"progressives\" and \"liberals\". Liberals are people of\nthe left who believe in the First Amendment, an\nabsolute First Amendment, and in due process of law. The problem with progressives now in the pursuit of equality, what they view as equality, they're willing to bend those rules. And this movement actually\nstarted in Brandeis. It's the critical race theory. Herbert Marcuse was a\nprofessor at Brandeis and he came up with this theory. The theory was this. This\nis right out of Orwell. In order to create true equality in a society where you\nhave some downtrodden and some who are the ubermenschen, in order to create real equality, you have to reduce the\nrights of the upper classes, and artificially increase the\nrights of the lower classes. That will produce, out of unequal treatment, true equality will be attained. This is nonsense. The idea of discrimination producing true equality is nonsense. My view is, as I've said\nearlier in our discussion, that the way to increase the opportunities for the lower classes is to give them real educations. And until we do that,\nit's not gonna happen. And in order to do that,\nwe have to overcome the problem of the teachers\nunions at the elementary and secondary school levels. Until we're willing to do that honestly, and improve those schools, we're gonna have a problem\nof large number of uneducated people who need a boost because we haven't given\nthem proper educations. - What do you think about\nsome of the more controversial faculty in the world? So, an example of somebody\nI've spoken with many times, on mic and offline, is Jordan Peterson. I'm not sure if you're\nfamiliar with his work. But he is an outspoken critic of, or proponent of free speech on campus, and he's been attacked quite a bit. He's a controversial figure. What's the role of the\nuniversity to protect the Jordan Petersons of the world? - I think the university\nhas an absolute, absolute, not relative, that absolute obligation to protect the academic freedom of even the most\ncontroversial faculty members. And you can imagine,\non a university campus, you have more people who are outliers than you do in the general population. - [Lex] That's the hope, at least. - Hopefully. Yeah. And those outliers have to be protected. They can't be pressured,\nthey can't be fired, they can't be disabled\nfrom spewing their views, whether they're considered racist, whether they're considered\nto promote an idea of human society that's\nconsidered obnoxious. It doesn't matter. If you can't have freedom of thought on the college campuses, where can you? Then we're lost. As a society, we're lost. And as an educational institution, educational institutions\nno longer will educate. They will indoctrinate. That, we have to avoid at all costs. - And we should also\nremember that the outlier might also be the only bearer of truth. So, in Nazi Germany, speaking\nagainst the fascist regime. In communist Soviet Union,\nspeaking against communism. They might hold the key to the solving the ailments of that society. - Absolutely. And some of the most important\ndiscoveries in science, for example, were mocked at the beginning. I mean, think of poor Charlie Darwin. - \"Charlie\". (chuckles) I see he is on nickname levels with you. Well, 'cause we're talking\nabout these big topics of sexism or racism and hate. We should not forget\nabout the smaller topics, which might even have\nthe much bigger impact, which is what you're speaking to, which is outlier ideas in science. So, basically welcoming\ncontroversial ideas in science. And by \"controversial\", I mean just stuff that most of the community\ndoesn't agree on. It doesn't actually harm anyone at all. But even then, there's always pressure. One of the things I'm\nreally concerned about is how little power young faculty have. That there's a kind of\nhierarchy, seniority, that universities have,\nempowered by the administration, where young faculty that\ncome in, they're kind of, um- - [Harvey] Pre-tenured. - Yeah, there's a\nprocess in chasing tenure where you're kind of supposed to behave, and there's an incentive\nto kind of fit in, and to not be an outcast, and that's a really huge\nproblem because, oftentimes, the youth is when the\ncraziest, the biggest ideas, the revolutionary ideas come\nand if you're forced to behave and fit in and not speak out, then even in the realm of science, the innovation is stifled. - Well, now you trigger my,\nhappy to tell you this story. - [Lex] You're triggered. This is good. - In the mid 1980s, I\ndecided to take a four-month sabbatical from my law practice. - [Lex] Yes. - Professor James Vorenberg, who was at the time Dean\nof the Harvard Law School, heard about it, heard\nabout it from his wife, Elizabeth Betty Vorenberg,\nwhom I was very friendly with, because we were both on the\nACLU of Massachusetts board, at the time. And so Betty told Jim that\nHarvey was taking a sabbatical. Jim called Harvey and asked\nHarvey if he would like to teach a course at the Harvard Law\nSchool because there was nobody who had teaching criminal\nlaw from the perspective of somebody who actually\nwas in court and litigated. It was all theoretical. I said, \"Sure, I'll do it.\" So, I taught a semester\nat Harvard Law School. The student evaluations\nwere fabulous. Why? Because it was really interesting. They were hearing a lawyer\nwho's talking about real cases. I actually brought in a few of my clients to some of the classes. And so Jim called me in and said, \"Harvey, the students love this course. I'd like to offer you a tenure track position at the law school. You'd have to give up your law practice.\" I turned him down. He said, \"Did you just say 'No'?\" I said, \"Yes, I said, 'No.'\" He said, \"How come?\" He says, \"Nobody in my administration has ever turned down a tenure track offer at Harvard Law School.\" I said, \"Because I could\nsee that I'm not a good fit. That the administrators\nare overrun the place. That faculty members,\nespecially untenured, are afraid to say things that might not help them\nin the tenure quest. It's not a good fit for me.\" - [Lex] You saw this in\nthe mid 1980s, already? - Yes, about 1985. And I went back to my law practice. I did not want to get\ninto this meat grinder that I saw. Actually, I started to see it, before the turn of the century, because I co-authored \"The\nShadow University\" in '98, and then co-founded FIRE in '99. I'm an early student of this phenomenon. - What are some other\naspects of this, the book, \"The Shadow University\",\nthat we may have not covered? - Well, let me tell you a story. I believe I tell it in\n\"The Shadow University\", 'cause it was part of- - [Lex] I'm loving these stories, Harvey. - The stories are fabulous. Let me tell you a story of... I did a tour of the\ncountry, visiting campuses. I visited a college\ncalled Hamline University. I believe it was in Indiana or Illinois. Somewhere in the Midwest. And I attended a freshman orientation. Now, listen to this. This was a freshman orientation. The administrators, the deans and the deanettes, and the deputy assistant\ndeans and deanettes, and the third-deputy\nassistant deans and deanettes, lined the students up,\naccording to their skin hues. - [Lex] Oh, boy. - The blonde, blue-eyed\nwhite folks were at one end. The darkest African Americans whose\nbloodlines had not yet mixed with any of the\nwhites, on the other end. And the exercise was, you\nhad to tell how your race affected your success in\nlife, up until that point. I thought it was the most demeaning thing that one could imagine. Demeaning. I thought to myself, \"They could do the same\nabout sexual orientation. They could do the same about religion. They could do the same\nabout national origin. It would be demeaning, no matter what.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And the students actually verbalized how their race had either been a plus or a minus. - They did it?\n- They did. And I thought it was so demeaning. It just confirmed all of my\ndistaste for this kind of, this kind of approach. - Let me ask you from\nthe interviewer seat. So, I get to do this podcast\nand I often have to think about giving a large platform\nand having a conversation with very controversial figures, and the level of controversy\nhas been slowly increasing. What's the role of this medium, to you? This medium of speech between two people, and me speaking with a\ncontroversial figure. Me, or some other interviewer. What's the role of giving\nplatform to controversial figures? Say, members of the KKK, or dictators, people who are seen as evil? - Well, we want face\nthe world with reality. And the reality is that\nthere is some unpleasantness, unpleasantnesses in the world. Running from genocide, right through to ordinary\ndiscrimination, to offensiveness. It's the real world, as we know it exists. Are we afraid to say it? Do we wanna make people\nthink that we live in a world where those words are not used? Where those animosities don't exist? The answer is no. - But you can whitewash, you can normalize the use of those words, and you can whitewash the\nacceptability of certain leaders. So, for example, interviewing\nHitler in 1938, 1935, 1936, 1937, '38, those are all\ndifferent dynamics there, but you can normalize this\nperson, and in so doing, create enormous harm. - Well, see, I don't\nsee it as normalizing. I see it as exposing. If more people had taken\n\"Mein Kampf\" seriously, Franklin Roosevelt\nwould've acted much sooner. He only got us into the war, asked Congress get us into the war, when the Japanese made the mistake of attacking Pearl Harbor. But there were some people\nin the State Department, there were some people\nin the administration who were trying to get Roosevelt to see what Hitler was really like, and he was blind to it! And this was one of\nthe greatest presidents the United States ever had. He was blind to it, until the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. So, I think that words, unpleasant ideas, as expressed by words are essential for communicating\nfact and truth and reality. And that's why I think that we should not whitewash language. We should not whitewash the\nfact that Jeffrey Epstein was pretty close to MIT. - And Harvard.\n- And Harvard. And reality, reality\nactually means something. - Yeah, but from the\nrole of the interviewer, that's something I have\nto think a lot about. Whether interviewing Hitler,\nyou said \"exposing\"... I think it's hard to know\nwhat Hitler's like in a room, but it's also hard to know,\nI've never met Jeffrey Epstein, it's hard to know what Jeffrey\nEpstein's like in a room, but I imagine, to some degree\nthey're charismatic figures. So exposing them in the interview setting is not an easy task. - Well, interviewing is not an easy- - All right.\n- Job. - [Lex] Yeah. - [Harvey] It's not a good idea to have an interviewer be an idiot. (Lex laughs) - I know exactly what you're saying, and I know why you're looking\nat me directly as you say it. I appreciate that, Harvey.\nAll right. (chuckles) Let me ask about your\nfriend, your colleague, Alan Dershowitz. And I'll also ask about your\nreview of his most recent book. But before then, it'd be interesting to ask what you think of him\nas a human being, as a lawyer. He's quite an interesting case. He's represented some of the most controversial figures in history. - Including Jeffrey Epstein.\n- Including Jeffrey Epstein. Mike Tyson, Julian Assange, Jim Baker, and Jeffrey Epstein,\nand even Donald Trump. So, he's an interesting figure. What do you think about that? - Claus von Bulow. - What do you think? What do you think about him\nas a human being, as a lawyer? What he represents, in\nterms of values and ideals? - Well, he is a criminal defense lawyer, and the job of a criminal defense lawyer is to represent accused criminals. He is a lifelong Democrat. He didn't represent Trump because he agrees with him politically. - Voted for Hillary, I believe you wrote. - He voted for Hillary.\nYes, that's what he says. And I absolutely believe\nit. He's a liberal Democrat. But he's a criminal defense\nlawyer, as well as a professor. And I've represented some very\nnasty people, in my career. I wouldn't go out for coffee with them, but they have constitutional\nrights to representation. - [Lex] And you take that very seriously. - Yes, you notice something that people don't understand about Dershowitz. He was asked by Trump to represent him in the second impeachment, as well. He turned him down. Why do\nyou think he turned him down? - So, people should know\nhe represented Trump in the first impeachment. - He represented him, only in the first, and he was successful, and when Trump was\nimpeached the second time, he asked Alan to represent him. Alan has had a lifelong policy of only representing somebody once. Never twice. Why? Because he never wanted to be\nhouse counsel to the mafia. So, he early on had this position. He only represents somebody once. The mafia wants a lawyer\nwho's an in-house counsel who represents them in all their cases. So, that's the reason and\nAlan never publicly explained that I know it's a fact,\n'cause I've known him from the day that we met at\nHarvard Law School in 1964. He was a first-year professor. I was a first-year student. We both had Brooklyn\naccents and we hit it off. We've been close friends, ever since. - So there's some kind of\nunethical line that's crossed when you continuously represent a client. - Yeah. He thought it was\nnot so much an ethical line. You have a right to\nrepresent mafia people, but he didn't want to be house counsel. He didn't want to have\nthem ask him for advice, in advance of what they were doing. He was willing to represent somebody once, no matter how awful. Claus von Bulow was accused\nof killing his wife. These are pretty nasty people. But he didn't want to be\nhouse counsel to any of them. - So, you wrote a review of\nAlan Dershowitz's new book on Donald Trump. The title of that book is, \"Get Trump: the Threat to Civil Liberties, Due Process and Our\nConstitutional Rule of Law\". Can you summarize this\nbook and your review of it? - Yes. By the way, I co-authored it\nwith my research assistant, who's sitting right here. - Emily?\n- Yes. I thought that the book was\nanother example of the fact that everybody's entitled\nto a defense and that Alan's being involved with Trump\nwas purely professional. It was not political. It\nwas not philosophical. And I thought that the fact\nthat he was being criticized, he was being shunned, because\nof his connection to Trump, I found very interesting\nthat this is a guy who represented such, I'll call them distasteful figures, as Claus von Bulow, as Mike Tyson, as OJ Simpson, as Sheldon Siegel. And when he was considered\nto be a skillful lawyer, made his reputation. And then he represents Donald\nTrump, who to my knowledge, never killed anybody, and he's suddenly shunned. I thought the hypocrisy of\nit, the political preening, was very distasteful to me. And it was not only\n'cause he was my friend. If he wasn't my friend, I\nthink I'd have the same view. The \"holier than thou\" nonsense. The hypocrisy of it. They wouldn't talk to him\non Martha's Vineyard now. Alan and I are different.\nI'm not so sensitive. Someone doesn't wanna\ntalk to me? No problem. No problem at all. But Alan, considering how\ncontroversial his life has been, - He's somewhat sensitive.\n- He's somewhat sensitive. And I've kept just telling Alan, \"Alan, don't let it get to you.\" - Hey. I can relate, I\ncan definitely relate. Taking on some\ncontroversial conversations. Still wear my heart on\nmy sleeve. It hurts. All of it hurts.\n- Yep. - But maybe the pain makes you a better student of human nature. Maybe that's the case for him. Nevertheless, the book makes a complicated and I think an interesting point. He opens the book with, \"Now that Donald Trump has\nannounced his candidacy for reelection as president,\nthe unremitting efforts by his political opponents\nto, quote, get him, to stop him from running, at\nany cost, will only increase. These efforts may pose the\nmost significant threat to civil liberty since McCarthyism.\" So, is he right?\n- He's absolutely right. Because these attempted... For example, the prosecution, the one prosecution that has\nbeen brought now, Alvin Bragg, in the Manhattan. I have looked at that, and I don't believe that\nTrump has committed a crime, and yet Bragg was pressured to bring that. People in his office\nwere threatening to quit, if he didn't indict. Wholly improper, wholly unethical, and he's gonna lose the case. Has Trump committed crimes? Yes. Mostly, they're tax crimes. He has cheated on taxes, his whole career, as far as I could tell. He could easily be indicted\nfor state and federal taxes, but they're not as sexy. And I think that he's become a target by ambitious politicians,\nambitious prosecutors. He has gotten some sympathy,\nwhich he doesn't deserve. and a lot of it is, pardon the phrase, political correctness. The better people are not\nsupposed to be Trumpers. I had an interesting\nexperience about Trump. I had two interesting experiences. The more recent one was\nI was in the house of Lawrence Summers, the\nformer president of Harvard, who was driven out by political\ncorrectness, by the way. He insulted women biologists. I was in his house when he was\nstill President of Harvard, when the Trump/Hillary\nClinton contest took place. And I was with Elsa. We were invited to Summers' house, in Brookline, and it looked like Hillary was gonna win, and the Harvard faculty members,\nthey were all celebrating, they were all figuring out\nwhat their cabinet positions were gonna be, blah,\nblah, blah, blah, blah. And then, at about 11:30 at night, all of a sudden, it was announced that, in terms of electoral votes, Trump had just eked out of a victory. That Hillary beat him in the popular vote, but he had won the electoral college, and there was an immediate depression. - [Lex] Meaning like quiet over the room? - The room became absolutely stone-silent. And they were all, you know, disappointed. Well, that was a memorable moment. And it told me that they were a little bit too overconfident. They were savoring being part of a\npresidential administration. Ambition had been thwarted. I'm not a great fan of preening ambition. I think it blinds people to realities. - [Lex] And the resulting\narrogance from such ambition. - And the arrogance, yes. It's one of the reasons I\ndidn't accept Jim Vorenberg's offer to be part of\nthe academic community. I mean, I represent professors, I had friends who were professors. I represent students, I have\nfriends who are students, and I have a great\nregard for universities, and higher education. But I was not about to\nbecome part of the culture. I thought that it was not good for me, and not good for the institution, either. - A culture that can breed arrogance. - Yes.\n- Self importance. - [Harvey] Yep. - And I, in a sense, the election of Donald Trump\nwas a big F.U. to such- - Correct. Which is why I think he, why I think he managed to pull it off. - To jump topics a little bit, what do you think about\nsomething you've written about, what do you think about the\nmass surveillance programs by the NSA and also probably\nby other organizations, CIA, FBI, and others? And broadly, what do you think about the importance of privacy\nfor the American citizen? - Okay. I believe that the FBI should be abolished. 'Cause I believe that its\nculture was so corrupted by its first director, John Edgar Hoover, J. Edgar Hoover, that it is impossible to reform the FBI to make its agents honest, to force them to obey the constitution. The First, Fourth and Fifth\namendments, especially. And it's a culture that cannot be changed. Hoover established the culture\nand no FBI director since has been able to change it. If you go online, I did, on YouTube, a video, for the ACLU of Massachusetts. It was when I was on the board. It was probably when I was\npresident of the board. I was president of the\nboard for two years. I was on the board for 20 years. And I did a video about advising\npeople to never, ever, ever talk to an FBI agent, when they come knocking on your door. - Can you briefly explain the intuition why not to talk to an FBI agent? - They have a system. When they come in and interview you, two agents show up, never one. One asks the question.\nThe other one takes notes. The note-taking agent\ntakes notes and it goes back to the office and types\nup a report called a Form 302, which is the official record\nof what was asked and answered. So, when I have a client\ninterviewed by the FBI, I show up, and I always agree, almost\nalways agree to the interview. But I bring a tape recorder. And I say, \"All right,\nI'm gonna tape this.\" And they say, \"Well, by regulation, we're not allowed to do the\ninterview if it's taped. The record is the 302,\nthe agent's taking notes.\" I say, \"Well, I have a policy, too. My policy is to never allow\na client to be interviewed, unless it's recorded. So, it's unfortunate, but we're gonna have to end this meeting.\" And the agents get up and leave. And I have never seen a Form 302 that I consider to be accurate. The agents write down what\nthey wish you had said. Rather than what you said. It is a wholly corrupt organization that has not gotten any\nbetter since Hoover died. - [Lex] And fundamentally, the\ncorruption is in the culture that is resisting the\nConstitution of the United States. The First and Fourth and Fifth amendments. - Correct. It's not financial corruption. It is corruption of the mission. And I think it should be abolished. And if we need a federal\ninvestigative agency, it should be a new name, a new\nculture, wholly new members, a new director. It's impossible to reform the FBI. - Can you elaborate on what\nexactly is broken about the FBI? Is it the famous saying, from Stalin's KGB head, Beria, \"Show me the man and\nI'll show you the crime\"? - Right.\n- Is it that kind of process? - It's that kind of process. They decide who's guilty and\nthen they go about concocting a case against a person\nwho they want to get. - [Lex] So, the goal is\nnot to find the truth or- - It's to solve the case and close it, and enhance their reputations. - But to show that an\ninnocent man is guilty is also solving the case,\nfrom their perspective. So, to falsely convict, or falsely imprison an innocent man is also solving the case. - Well, it closes the case, if they falsely imprison an innocent man. They're interested in closing cases. - So, that's the FBI, but broadly speaking about the surveillance aspect of this, what are your views on the right that an American citizen has to privacy? - Well, wire tapping and\nelectronic surveillance are very, very intrusive. And I think that the circumstance that these tools are\nused should be narrowed. For example, they're used\nin a lot of drug cases. Since I don't think drugs\nshould be illegal in any event, I certainly think that it's a\nterrible violation of privacy to use wire tapping in a drug case. I could see it in cases of murder, possibly in cases of serious extortion, but on other kinds of kinds\nof crimes where they wire tap, especially drug cases, I believe drugs should\nall be legalized anyway, I think it's... The price we pay as\nsociety is not worth it. - On the Wikipedia page for\n\"Nothing to hide\", you're cited. In fact, your book that you gave me today, \"Three Felonies A Day\", is cited. So, \"nothing to hide\" argument. That's an argument that if\nyou're a well-behaved citizen, you have nothing to hide, and therefore your\nprivacy can be violated. - Well, the problem is that\nunder the federal criminal code, particularly the federal criminal code, it is very easy to be\ncharged with a crime. Now, why? Under the Constitution, the Federal Government does not have plenary criminal jurisdiction. That's up to the state. How is it that the feds indict, in so many areas of American life? It's because the Supreme Court\nhas allowed the following absolutely insane situation to prevail. Anything can be made a federal crime, if, in the course of the\ncommission of the crime, the means of interstate\ncommunication or travel are used. That means that if you commit a crime, which ordinarily would be a state crime, and you use the telephone\nor you send a letter, it suddenly becomes federal. That means that the limitation\nthat the founding fathers who wrote the Constitution intended to keep the feds out of daily life and to give that jurisdiction to the state has been completely thwarted. 'Cause I can't think of the a case where somebody doesn't use a telephone, in the course of planning, discussing something\nthat's arguably criminal. And so this limited authority,\nthe federal government, to bring charges in\ncriminal cases, is illusory. The feds can indict a ham sandwich. - So basically, everybody's\nguilty, and if the, if the feds wanna bring you in, they can. They can find a way.\n- Correct. And that allows them to terrorize\npeople who are dissidents. - Yeah. What is broken, what works, about the American criminal justice system,\nfrom your perspective? - [Harvey] The jury system. - The jury system?\n- Yes. - You like the jury system.\nEveryday citizens representing- - 12 ordinary people have\nto agree, unanimously, in order to convict. - What do you think about the\nhighest court in the land, the Supreme Court? What works and what is broken\nabout the Supreme Court, as an institution? What are its strengths and weaknesses? - Well, the Supreme Court is unfortunately fairly political. And the current Supreme Court\nis overruling precedence, which, it's really improper. Precedence should not\nbe overruled so easily. It's about to overrule\nthe affirmative action. Now, I'm opposed to affirmative action. I think I made that clear\nearlier in our discussion, but still, it's a precedent, and it should be given some respect. But in order to, in order to propagate a more conservative agenda, the court is treating precedent as if it doesn't have any role, and that's a huge mistake. Some of the congressmen\non the Democratic side are looking to enlarge the court, in order to basically do\nwhat Franklin Roosevelt was not able to do. And that is, change\nthe court's philosophy. But I think that's very shortsighted, because this is a long game. This is a republic we have here. And anyone who tries to, for example, enlarge\nthe court from 9 to 12, in order to get more\nliberals on the court, then some other administration\nwill try to enlarge it from 12 to 15, to get more\nliberals on the court. You'd have a constant fiddling with a\nvery important institution. - So the law should\nhave more lasting power than the political bickering of the day. - Correct. - Let me ask you, you've\nlived one heck of a life, and fought a lot of battles\nand you continue to do so, with the Harvard Board of Overseers. So, first of all, thank\nyou for that, but uh, we're all human, we're all mortal. Do you ponder your death? Do you ponder your mortality?\nAre you afraid of it? - Well, let me say this.\nMy father died at 48. He died 'cause he smoked. He died at 48 because he smoked\nfour packs of Camels a day. He got a massive heart attack at 43. He continued to smoke, despite that. He died at 48. So, I did not\nexpect to live this long. 'Cause I thought it was genetic. It turns out it was cigarettes. So, here I am, I'm\ngonna be 81 on May 10th. I was born on May 10th, 1942, which is Mother's Day, coincidentally, and I realize I'm not gonna live forever. I also take pride in the\nfact that I have demonstrated that a lawyer does not\nhave to go with a law firm, in order to manage to make it. You can make your own, write\nyour own, what's the word? Write your own ticket. I've done that. I agree that I've had an elite education. I went to Princeton\nand Harvard Law School. But I don't think you have to necessarily go to elite institutions\nin order to really make it. You need to work hard. But you shouldn't put\nyourself in a place where you're not gonna feel\ncomfortable and what's the word? Empowered? Like I refused to take Vorenberg's invitation for tenure track\nposition at Harvard Law School. I'll tell you one other\nstory that illustrates this. I was originally pre-med. My freshman-sophomore years at Princeton, I was in the pre-med program. Why? Because my parents wanted me to marry the daughter\nof our family physician. And the idea was I was\ngonna go to medical school and I was gonna go into\nmedical practice with him in Hackensack, New Jersey. We had moved from Brooklyn at the time. Long story why we had\nto move from Brooklyn. It had to do with my\nfather's having a problem with the Furies Union and\nhaving his life threatened. And we moved to Maywood, New Jersey, 'cause he got a job in a fur\nshop in Passaic, New Jersey. And a family physician,\nthey had three daughters, the oldest of whom was my age. She went to Hackensack High School. I went to Pagoda High School. They're both in North Burton County. And the idea was that she\nand I were gonna marry, I was gonna go to medical\nschool, I was going to become a partner of her father, in his medical practice in Hackensack. When he retired, I was\ngonna inherit the practice. This scenario was concocted\nby Carolyn's mother, and my mother. In my sophomore year at Princeton, I won a fellowship to spend that summer between my sophomore and\njunior year in Paris. I was fluent by then. I had taken an accelerated French course, my freshman-sophomore year. And I went to Paris. It was my first time out of the country. I spent the entire summer working, supporting myself there,\nfirst to pay the airfare, and I earned money for room and board. And I thought about my life\nand I decided, number one, I didn't want to be a physician,\nI wanted to be a lawyer. Number two, I didn't\nwant to marry Carolyn. And I came back, I changed\nfrom pre-med to pre-law. I broke up with Carolyn, who was, by that time,\nat school at Douglas, right down the road from Princeton. She had followed me. Or I had followed her. My life suddenly took a\nwholly different turn. So, that summer, in Paris, Paris had a outsized effect of my life. Every year, the Bravo\nTheater shows \"Casablanca\", where Bogart has this great line. He says, \"We'll always have Paris.\" And I think to myself, I\nalways used to say Elsa, we used to see \"Casablanca\"\nevery Valentine's Day, 'cause it was such an\nimportant movie to me, because Paris was\ntransformative in my life, and we went to Paris, every year. During my vacation, we went to Paris. That was where she took\nsome great pictures of Isaac where he was this high and this high, and they were hanging up in the house. And so I always... And even after Elsa's death, I've seen \"Casablanca\" twice now. She died in 2020. And I always think,\n\"We'll always have Paris.\" - \"We'll always have Paris.\" (Lex breathes deeply) Well, Harvey, like I said, I hope you're\nvery successful in your, in your run for the\nHarvard Board of Overseers. I think what you stand for, in the realm of freedom of speech is I think the thing that\nmakes these universities great institutions in American culture, and I'll do everything I\ncan to help you succeed and I just am really grateful\nfor all the work you've done and I'm grateful that you\nwould talk with me today. This was amazing. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Harvey Silverglate. To support this podcast,\nplease check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you some\nwords from Harry S. Truman. \"Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing\nthe voice of the opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of\nterror to all its citizens, and creates a country where\neveryone lives in fear.\" Thank you for listening and\nI hope to see you next time."

Without it, no democratic\nsociety can be democratic, for long. And I'm an absolutist. That is, I believe that, for\nexample, people say to me, \"But what about hate speech?\" Well, hate speech is much more\nimportant than love speech, and the reason is, I'm much\nmore interested in knowing whom I should not turn my back on, than I am interested in\nfiguring out who loves me. - The following is a conversation\nwith Harvey Silverglate, a legendary free speech\nadvocate, co-founder of FIRE, the Foundation for Individual\nRights and Expression, and the author of several books on the freedom of speech\nand criminal justice, including \"The Shadow University: The Betrayal of Liberty\non America's Campuses\".

It's by having such\ndifficult conversations, not by avoiding them, that we can begin to heal\ndivides and to shed lights on the dark parts of human\nhistory and human nature. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description, and now, dear friends, here's Harvey Silverglate. You co-founded the Foundation for Individual\nRights and Expression, also known as FIRE. A legendary organization that fights for the freedom of\nspeech for all Americans in our courtrooms, on our\ncampuses and in our culture. So, let's start with a big question. What is freedom of speech? - First of all, the organization\nwhen I co-founded it, in 1999, was called the Foundation\nfor Individual Rights in Education. It focused on free speech issues on\ncollege campuses in academia. And only earlier this year did\nwe decide to expand our reach beyond the campuses,\nwhich is why the name, although the acronym, FIRE, remains, it's now the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. - [Lex] The E used to be education. - E used to be education,\nit's now expression. And we basically do a lot of\nthe cases the ACLU used to do. The ACLU now, they're a\nprogressive organization, rather than a civil\nliberties organization. And we've taken the role\nof dealing with free speech in the society generally, and now this is a particularly, and you are prone to censorship. Everybody thinks they're right\nand that people who disagree with them should not be\nable to voice their views. It's a very difficult period right now, both on campus and off campus. It's about as intolerant\nan era as I can remember. I'm gonna be 81, May 10th. I was born on Mother's Day, 1942. And I can't remember it being this bad. I was born during the McCarthy era. - [Lex] So that says a lot. - It sort of reminds me of that. - Well, let's start with almost\na philosophical question, a legal question, a human question. What is this freedom that\nyou care so much about that you fought for so\nmuch, freedom of speech? - It is the most important\nright that Americans have. It's not a coincidence or an accident that it's named in the First\nAmendment to the Constitution. Without it, no democratic society can be democratic for long. And I'm an absolutist. That is, I believe that, for\nexample, people say to me, \"But what about hate speech?\" Well, hate speech is much more\nimportant than love speech, and the reason is, I'm much\nmore interested in knowing whom I should not turn my back on, than I am interested in figuring out who loves me or who likes me. So, hate speech is most\nimportant, in my view, and yet, it's banned in,\nfor example, schools. It's unbelievable. Kids are not schooled into understanding the glory\nof the First Amendment, when schools say to them\nthey shouldn't say things that are gonna make somebody feel bad. The purpose of speech is to express honest views that people have. So, I believe hate speech is\nas important as love speech, and in my view, it's more important. - So it should be brought to the surface, rather than operate in the shadows? - Absolutely. Absolutely. - What is the connection\nbetween freedom of speech and freedom of thought? - Well, in a free society, thoughts start in the brain and then they come out the mouth. So, they are different\nends of the same spectrum. - So, to you, the censorship of speech eventually leads to a\ncensorship of thought? - Of course. Censorship of the mode by which other people\nknow what you're thinking. - So there's some aspect of our society, that thinking is done collectively, and without being able\nto speak to each other, we cannot do this kind\nof collective thinking. - Correct, and the theory\nis that, ultimately, out of speech comes truth. That isn't necessarily so, but I do think that when\nthere's free speech, better decisions are made, because people put their\nviews on the table in a frank, accurate way, and then those views mix together, and clash, and out of that, usually, comes the better decision. Not always, but usually,\nor more often than not. But if somebody is not allowed to sit at the table of decision making, then the decision making\nprocess is poorer, less robust, less diverse, and\nultimately less successful. - So can you elaborate on the idea of free speech absolutism? So... Hate speech can be quite painful to quite\na large number of people. Does this worry you?\n- Yeah. Living in a free society\nrequires that you expose yourself to some discomfort. You could call it pain. It's maybe emotional pain.\nIt's not physical pain. But it's the price we pay\nfor living in a free society. Every so often, we're insulted,\nwe're emotionally hurt. Think of the alternative. All the alternatives are worse. Nobody ever promised us a rose garden. We're lucky to be in a country\nthat has the First Amendment. It's also the most diverse\ncountry in the world, because of immigration. I mean, my grandparents\non my father's side came over from Russia, on my mother's side,\ncame over from Poland. I'm very happy that my\ngrandparents came in from Russia. I would not want to be in Russia today. I'd probably be sharing a cell with a Wall Street Journal reporter. So, I'm thankful that they came in, and this is a great country. It's got troubles right now,\nbut what country doesn't? And we've had, before we had a civil war, we had segregation. We had the decimation of the Indians. We're not perfect. But it's the best place in the world for somebody who values liberty. - So you don't think that hate speech can empower large groups that eventually will lead to physical action, to physical harm to others? - No, I don't. I think that we have\ndeveloped a culture in which it's understood that if you\ndon't like what you hear, you talk back. You write something. We don't punch each other.\nWe insult each other. Is insulting great? Well, I don't know. It's okay. I used to, as a kid in\nBrooklyn where I was born, I was born and raised in Bensonhurst, we used to say, \"Sticks and\nstones can break my bones, but names can never harm me.\" And it's absolutely true. It what was true when I was\nfive and it's true when I'm, I'm almost 81. So, I've lived a long\ntime, I've seen it all, and talking from experience,\nas well as theory. It's what happens when you reach your 80s. (Lex chuckles) - I read that you had this line that \"You cannot be protected from\nbeing called an asshole.\" - Correct.\n- (chuckles) Okay. - [Harvey] Especially\nif you're an asshole. - (laughs) Well, that's... But you don't have to be an\nasshole to be called an asshole. - [Harvey] That's correct. - And I think the internet\nhas taught me that. - Well, the internet has\nposed a particular challenge to free speech absolutists\nbecause some of the stuff that's on there is god awful. But I have no different\nrule for freedom of speech on the internet than I have\nin newspapers or in lectures or in classrooms, or\nconversations among people. - What do you think\nabout the tension between freedom of speech and freedom of reach? As it's kind of sometimes termed. So the internet really\nchallenges that aspect. It allows speech to become\nviral and spread very quickly to a very large number of people. - Yeah, well, you know,\nwe've had revolutions in the modalities of communication. After all, newspapers\nwere the first challenge. Radio and television\nposed a new challenge. The FCC tried, but ultimately gave up\nthe attempt to control obscenity, for example. And the Supreme Court\nhas been pretty close. The one thing that liberal and conservative supreme courts... Right now we're in a conservative era, due to Trump nominations. During much of my life,\nit was the Warren Court. It was William O. Douglas, Brennan. It was a liberal court. One thing they agree on is free speech. They don't agree on much else, but they do agree on free\nspeech and I think the reason is that they recognize that, well, my group is in the ascendance today, but it may not be tomorrow\nand I want to have objective, clear rules, so that\nwhen I'm in the minority, I'm able to voice my opinion. And so it's one of the few things that both sides of the political\nspectrum agree on. The only people who don't are the people way over on the right\nthat I call the fascists, and the people way over on the\nleft who are the communists. But with respect to most people\non the political spectrum, Republicans, Democrats,\nsocialists, libertarians, they agree on the primacy of free speech, because it protects them,\nwhen protection is needed. - So, to you, even on the internet, free speech absolutism should rule. - Yes. Nobody's gonna die. Remember, death threats are not protected. Nobody's gonna die. So, people are gonna be\na little bit insulted? That's the price you pay for\nliving in a free society. And it's a small price, in my view. Some people don't have as\ntough a hide as others? Well, then develop it. I don't mean to sound cruel, but you're living in a free society. Develop a tough hide. - So that's the cost of\nliving in a free society? - [Harvey] Yep. There's a cost. - The thing is that it\ncan really hurt, at scale, to be cyber bullied, to be attacked, for the ideas you express or\nmaybe ideas you didn't express, but that somebody\ndecided to lie about you, and use that to attack you. - Well, first of all,\nthere are some exceptions to the First Amendment. Libel and slander is an exception. Direct threats are an exception. If you say such and such,\n\"I will murder you.\" That is not lawful. If you say to somebody... If you say about somebody, \"Oh, you know. You beat your wife.\" That is not lawful, if in fact, the person knows you don't beat your wife. There are some limits. Defamation is one. Direct threats are another. So, the First Amendment is not absolute, but it's more absolute than\nit is in any other society, and it's pretty near absolute. For example, fraud. If you sell somebody a car, and you say, \"Oh, this is in great running shape, and in fact it's an old jalopy, and it's not gonna make it more\nthan 10 miles, that's fraud. That's not free speech. So, free speech is not absolute,\nthere are these limits, but they're very narrow,\nspecific categories of limits. - But there's gray area here, because, while legally you're not\nallowed to defame a person, in the court of public opinion, especially with the aid of\nanonymity on the internet, rumors can spread, at scale. Thousands, hundreds of\nthousands of people, can make up things about you. - You have to defend yourself. - [Lex] Using more speech. - Through freedom of speech,\nwe're big boys and girls. You have to defend yourself. In some societies, if you say something... Right now, if you say\nsomething nasty about Putin, you'll end up in the gulag. If you say something nasty about Biden, you end up in \"The New York Times\". Where would you rather be? - Well, let's talk about\nthe thing you've done for over 20 years, which is\nfight for the freedom of speech on college campuses. So, why is freedom of speech\nimportant on college campuses? - Well, it's important\neverywhere in the society, but it's most important\non college campuses. Why? 'Cause that's where we\neducate our young citizens. And if you are educated\nunder a notion that some dean can call you on the carpet, because you say something\nwhich is considered racist, or you can say something\nwhich is considered dangerous to social cohesion, then it's not a liberal arts college. The theory that I used in\n\"The Shadow University\"- - A book you've written.\n\"The Shadow University\". - [Harvey] 1998. - 1998. You were ahead of a lot of\nthese things, by the way. - I'm afraid that as a pessimist, I always saw the bad side of things. - \"Betrayal of Liberty\non America's Campuses: The Shadow University\". A book you co-authored with Alan Charles. - Yes, with one of my Princeton\nclassmates, Alan Charles, of course, who's now an emeritus professor of enlightenment history at\nthe University of Pennsylvania. I only taught for one semester\nand I can go into that later. The reason that I did not\ncontinue to teach in colleges. It was Harvard Law School. I taught a course in the mid-1980s. But in any event, the college campuses are\none of the most important for free speech because it's\nwhere people get education. And if you don't really\nget a good education, if certain points of view are\nnot allowed to be expressed, because education comes\nfrom the clash of ideas, and you then have to decide... This is how you become a thinking adult. You have to decide which\nideas make more sense to you, which ones you're gonna follow. The college experience is transformative. And if there is censorship on campuses, it's highly destructive of\nthe educational enterprise and ultimately to the entire society. We have, in the sciences, we have scientific method. Scientific method is you try experiments and you see which ones work\nand then you develop theories, based upon the results of experiments. Well, this is not much different from every other aspect of life. You have to entertain different\nviews on different subjects. You hear all the views\nand you make a decision as to which one's accurate\nand which one's not. So, the scientific method\nI apply to non-science, to history, to journalism. To all of these things. - So that scientific\nmethod includes ideas. Hateful ideas, also.\n- Correct. If you don't allow hateful ideas... I mean, when scientists do\nexperiments, nobody says to them, \"Oh, you know, don't do that experiment, because it would be very bad, if that turns out to be\naccurate, that outcome.\" That's not the way it works. Every point of view is\nthrown into the marketplace, whether it's science or\nwhether it's non-science. - And that includes the kind of ideas and the kind of discourse\nthat might actually lead to an increase in hate on campuses? - The First Amendment prohibits speech which is\nliable to produce imminent, imminent violence. - Yeah.\n- So, for example. The exception is yelling, falsely, falsely yelling \"fire\" in\na crowded movie theater. A lot of people misstate it. They say, \"Oh, the exception is yelling 'fire' in a movie theater.\" Well, if there's really a fire, you're performing a\nreal important function. - [Lex] They usually\ndon't mention that part. - But it's falsely yelling \"fire\". You could start a riot. People would be crushed trying to get out. So, that's one of the exceptions\nto the First Amendment, as the Supreme Court has defined it. There are very few exceptions. And defamation is an exception. I'm not a fan of that exception, frankly, but if you say something about somebody that has serious\nimplications in their life, in their ability to earn a living, if you accuse somebody\nof being a pedophile, when it's not true,\nthat person can sue you. My own view is, I think that's\nan unfortunate exception, but I'm not on the Supreme Court. I think that I'm with... A friend of mine was Nat Hentoff. Nat Hentoff who wrote for decades for \"The Village Voice\" in New York. He was a friend of mine. He was a free speech absolutist. And he wrote a fabulous book called, \"Free Speech For Me, But Not For Thee\". And he was an absolutist\nand I'm with Nat Hentoff. - Even on the defamation aspect. I agree with you in some sense,\njust practically speaking, it seems like that the best way in the\npublic sphere to defend against defamation is with more speech. - [Harvey] Correct. - And through authenticity,\nthrough authentic communication of the truth, as you see it. - Yeah, you know, at\ntimes, \"The Boston Globe\" has said something about me\nthat hasn't been accurate. They have invariably published\nmy letter to the editor. I'm also not bashful about getting\nin touch with the reporter. At the end of every column, they give the reporter's email address. And I know people say\nthat I have more access to the media than most people, but all that means is I get\ndefamed more than most people. - Can we also comment on, from the individual consumer of speech, there's a kind of sense\nthat freedom of speech means you should be forced to read all of it. Freedom of speech,\nversus freedom of reach. We, as consumers of speech, do we have the right\nto select what we read? - We do, and nobody can\nforce us to sit in a room and listen to a radio program\nthat we don't wanna listen to. Nobody can force us to read a\nbook that we don't wanna read. The whole motion of freedom\nof speech means that people have autonomy on their choices. - In order to form a complete\nmind and complete human being, there's a kind of\ntension of that autonomy, versus consuming as many varied\nperspectives as possible, which is underlying the\nethic of free speech. So, on college campuses, it seems like a good\nway to develop the mind is to get as many\nperspectives as possible. Even if you don't really want to. - Well, that is the theory. Academic freedom is supposed to be the highest\ndegree of free speech. - [Lex] Yeah. - You should be able to entertain all kinds of hateful, threatening ideas. And the way I put it is, there's something wrong\nwhen you can say something with complete abandon, without\nany fear, in Harvard Square. Whereas on the other side of the fence, you can't say it in Harvard Yard. It should be the opposite. And what happens is, universities, from the best to the worst, from the most famous to\nthe least well known, have been taken over by administrators. Administrators do not really\nsubsume academic values. They know nothing about the constitution. They know nothing about free speech. They know nothing about academic freedom. They feel that their job is to keep order. And so they develop speech codes, kangaroo courts to\nenforce the speech codes. And these are very dire developments. I wrote about them in \"The\nShadow University\" in '98, and tried to deal with them in 1999, when I started FIRE, co-started FIRE. I would fire... The reason I'm running currently for the Harvard Board of Overseers is what I'd like to do is convince\nthe Harvard Corporation, the so-called President\nFellows of Harvard College, the chief governing\nboard of the university with the real power. The Board of Overseers\nis a secondary body, but quite influential. To fire 95% of the administrators. It would have a salutary effect on the academics of the university. It would have a salutary\neffect on free speech and academic freedom. It would cut tuitions by about 40%. And it would create a\nwhole different atmosphere on the campus and the\nsame could be said of MIT, or any other place. I think administrators are a very bad influence on American\nhigher education. - Can you elaborate the\nintuition of why this thing that you call \"administrative bloat\" is such a bad thing for a university? - Well, first of all. Just in terms of the cost of maintaining. There are more administrators\nin American higher education than there are faculty members. The cost is enormous. Number two. They are inimical to the teaching enterprise and they feel that their\njob is to control things, to make sure there are no problems, and nobody's feelings are hurt. Being called before a dean\nbecause you said something that insulted somebody is\nsomething that shouldn't happen in American higher\neducation, yet it happens, because you have these\nadministrators who think it's their job to protect\npeople from being insulted. You insult a black student,\nyou insult a woman, there's a disciplinary hearing. Well, there shouldn't be. Black people are accustomed\nto being insulted. Jews are accustomed to being insulted. Women are accustomed to being insulted. And it's very good to\nknow who doesn't like you. It's useful. It's essential information\nto know who doesn't like you. If everybody is forced to say \"I love you\" and nobody can say \"I hate you\", you get a false view of\nwhat life is all about. - [Lex] Outside of the university. - Outside of the university. I mean, you do graduate, eventually. - And that's ultimately the\nmission of the university is to prepare you, to make\nyou into a great human being, into a great leader, that can take on the\nproblems of the world. - Correct. And you don't do it by treating\nyou like a little flower. - But what role does the university have to protect students? To women, African Americans. Anybody. Jews. Anybody who could be a\nvictim of hate speech. - They protect you from physical assault. If somebody physically assaults\nyou, then they get punished. But they shouldn't protect\nyou against insult, because that is a violation\nof academic freedom. The freedom of the\ninsulter, to insult you. And also, as I said, it's very useful to know\nwho doesn't like you. It's useful for the so-called victim. I think, as I said, I wanna\nknow who doesn't like me. It's as important to me as\nknowing who who likes me. - But do you also believe in\nthis open space of discourse that the insulter will eventually lose? - I think that's true. I think that the insulter, eventually, will wear out his or her welcome. I do, but I like to know\nwho the insulters are. - [Lex] 'Cause it gives\nyou a deeper understanding of human nature. - Yeah, and usually, by the way, my experience has been that\nthe insulters have generally not been as smart as the\npeople they've insulted. And that's probably one of\nthe reasons they insult them, because they feel inferior. I mean, I'm not trying to\nbe a psychoanalyst here, but a lot of the people\nwho are the haters are pretty low down on the intellectual scale. - Anyway. 95% of administration, you would fire. You're calling to fire\n95% of the administration. - Correct.\n- People should know. I think people that don't really\nthink about the structure, the way the universities work,\nare not familiar, I think, with the fact that administration, there's a huge bloat of administration. When you think about what\nmakes a great university, it's about the students,\nit's about the faculty, it's about the people that do research, if it's a research university. They don't think about the\nbureaucracy of meetings and committees and rules\nand paperwork and all that, and all the people that are involved with pushing that kind of paper, and there's a huge cost to that, but it also slows down and suppresses the beautiful variety that\nmakes a university great, which is the teaching, the\nstudent life, the protests, the clubs, all the fun that\nyou can have in a university. All the varied exploration, which you can't really\ndo once you graduate. - Correct.\n- It's the place. The university is a\nplace to really explore. - Mm-hm.\n- In every single way. So, let me just talk about\nthis important thing, because I'm very fortunate\nto have contacted you, almost by accident, in a very\nimportant moment in your life. You're running for the\nHarvard Board of Overseers. What is this board? How\nmuch power does it have? And what would you do, if elected? - Okay, first of all, I have a prediction that in about five years, they're gonna probably change the name, because \"Overseers\" reminds\npeople of the slavery era and we're in such a\npolitically-correct era now that the English language\nis being restricted. \"Corrupted\" is the way I put it. Because certain words are forbidden. We have some problems in this country, and I think a part of the\nproblem is the educational system has lost the sense of\nwhat academic freedom and free speech are all about. And I think it's essential that\nthe educational system begin to take more seriously what free speech and academic freedom really are! That's why I'm running for the\nHarvard Board of Overseers. - So, let me just linger on the role of the administration\nin protecting free speech. So what often happens and I\nthink you've written about this, is there's going to be\nmaybe a small number of hypersensitive students\nand faculty that protest. So, how does Harvard administration resist the influence of those\nhypersensitive protestors in protecting speech, in\nprotecting even hate speech? - Harvard has done fairly well, under the presidency of Lawrence Bacow. I have had a couple of\nmeetings with Bacow. I like Bacow. I have donated to Harvard a print of, my late wife took a picture of\nBob Dylan and Allen Ginsburg when \"The Rolling Thunder\nReview\" got to Harvard Square, and it's sort of an iconic photograph. She called it \"The Music\nLesson\", 'cause it's got Dylan teaching Ginsburg how to play the guitar. And I donated one of those to Harvard. It's hanging in Bacow's office. The new president, Claudine Gay, is not known for\nrespecting academic freedom and free speech. People have said to me,\n\"Well, give her a chance.\" Well, I'm willing to give her a chance, but she does have a record,\nand she's a bureaucrat. I don't think she believes in free speech and academic freedom. I think she's a\nprogressive, not a liberal. I'm not happy with the appointment of Claudine Gay, and it has made more essential my attempt to get on\nthe Board of Overseers. - So, let's talk about\nthe Board of Overseers, and your run for it. The specifics, actually.\n- Okay. - It'll be nice because I think\nyou're a write-in candidate and the election is over on May 16th? - [Harvey] Yes. - And I think there are specifics. I'll probably give them in the intro. I'll give links to people but\nthe specifics are complicated. Let me just mention that you\nhave to be Harvard alumni. So have graduated from Harvard. - [Harvey] You have to in order\nto run and in order to vote. - In order to vote. And the process, I imagine\nis not trivial, but, this is done online and\nif you're an alumni, you should have received an email from a particular email address, harvard@mgelectionservicescourt.com. And presumably there's a way\nto get some validation number from that email and then you go online, you enter that validation\nnumber and you vote and to vote for Harvey,\nyou have to enter his name, correctly, Harvey Silverglate,\nand spell it correctly. Obviously I'm imagining this,\nbecause I'm MIT, not Harvard, so I'm imagining the\nprocess is not trivial, 'cause you have to click\non things, you have to follow instructions that are not trivial. And I'll also provide an email\nif the process is painful, it doesn't work for you, that you can email Harvard and complain. IThelp@Harvard.edu and so on. I'll provide all the links. But is there something else you can say about the voting process,\nwhat you're running on? - This is my second run. The first time, I got enough signatures to get on the ballot. Then the Harvard Alumni Association sent out a letter to all living Harvard alums, recommending that they vote for the officially-nominated candidates. That excluded two petition\ncandidates, of whom I was one. And I wrote to the Alumni\nAssociation and I said, \"You have now sent out\nthe curriculum vitaes, and the policy positions of all the officially-nominated\ncandidates. There are two petition\ncandidates on the ballot. I would like to be able to send out my positions to the voters. They wrote me back saying, \"Our policy is to only send\nout the policy positions and the platforms of\nofficially-nominated candidates.\" Can you believe that? Well, this is a liberal\narts college, right? Where, from the clash\nof ideas, truth emerges. Well, really? This is what I call\nHarvard's not-so-subtle means of candidate suppression,\nnot voter suppression. Candidate suppression. And everybody can vote,\nbut not everybody can run. Ill becomes a liberal arts college where the clash of ideas\nwill produce the truth. Well, what about the clash of ideas of the Board of Overseers? The Board of Overseers is important. It doesn't have the\nsame power or authority as the Harvard Corporation, the so-called President and\nFellows of Harvard College. But it's very influential\nand very important and it would be a great perch for me to try to exert influence for\nthe university to get back to where it was before it was taken over by the administrators. - Well, I'm pretty sure\nthat most of Harvard alumni, most of the students\ncurrently going to Harvard, most of the faculty at Harvard, probably stand behind the ideas and the ideals that you stand behind. - [Harvey] Yep. - The people that love Harvard\nand what it stands for. - The alumni were educated in an era when these concepts were\ntaken more seriously and before the administrators took over. So, I do think if I get my message out, I'm gonna win a seat. And if I win a seat, I\nwill have a great perch for trying to convince\nthe real power that be, which is the Harvard Corporation, to do the things that I'm suggesting. Get rid of 95% of the administrators, get rid of their speech\ncodes, reduce tuition by 40%. All of these salutary benefits. Can you imagine if Harvard became the most affordable college\nin the United States? - Well, the affordability\nis another aspect, but I think before that, just\nthe freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom of thought at America's greatest\nuniversities, I think, is something that\neverybody would agree on. - [Harvey] It would\nhave a tremendous effect on the whole country. - And is there something\nto say about the details of how difficult it is for alumni to vote? Do you have experience with this? - You could vote online or\nyou can vote by paper ballot. You could request a paper ballot. And all I could say is that the hard part is getting the message out. My name doesn't appear on the ballot, 'cause I couldn't get enough signatures. - Well, Harvey, Harvey Silverglate. - S-I-L-V-E-R-G-L-A-T-E. When my grandparents arrived from Russia, the name in Russia was\nsomething like Zilbaglit, and the immigration officer\nhad several choices. He could have said\nSilvergate. Gate is a real... Silver and gate are real English words. He could have said Silverglade. G-L-A-D-E. Those are real English words. That's how my name is often misspelled. Either Silvergate or Silverglade. Silverglate is a nonsense syllable. And why the immigration officer chose to transliterate Zilbaglit as Silverglate, I'll never understand, and it is the cause of\nendless mistakes in my name. - [Lex] Well, the the\nfundamental absurdity of life is also the source of its beauty. - Yes. - Anyway. We shall spell it out and we shall yell loud and wide that everybody who has\never graduated from Harvard should vote for you, if\nthey believe in the ideals of the great American universities, which I think most people do. Let me also ask about diversity, inclusion and equity programs. You've had a few harsh\nwords to say about those. The idea of diversity, I\nthink, is a beautiful ideal. You've said that Harvard's\nidea of diversity is for everyone to look\ndifferent and think alike. - Correct.\n- Can you elaborate? - And be comfortable. - And be comfortable.\n- Yeah. First of all, it is impossible, if liberal arts education\nis taken seriously, it's impossible for students\nto feel comfortable. Why? Because one of the roles\nof college is to challenge all the beliefs that they grew up with, which mostly are the beliefs inculcated by parents and by\nelementary school teachers. And the idea is to be able to challenge those thoughts, those ideas. And if you don't have free\nspeech and academic freedom, those views get reified,\nthey do not get challenged. It violates the fundamental\nrole of higher education institutions to have\nany restrictions at all. That's number one. Number two, as I think I said earlier, if students are not allowed\nto be frank with one another, they don't really learn about one another. I've given a lot of lectures\nin which I have said, and I think students now understand it, I'm much more interested in hearing from the people who hate me\nthan the people who love me. I'm much more interested in\nknowing who disagrees with me than people who agree with me. That's how I learn, and that's how they learn. The clash of ideas, which is the theory behind\nthe First Amendment. That truth will somehow\nemerge, or if not truth, at least a better truth, a truer truth, a more useful truth, if\nideas are allowed to clash. - Especially in the structure\nof a university where at least I would say\nthere's some set of rules, some set of civility. I think I would rather read \"Mein Kampf\" to understand people that hate. There is also a quality to disagreement that we should strive for. And I think a university is a\nplace where when disagreement and even hate is allowed, it's\ndone in a high effort way. - Somebody asked me once about what books would have as required\nreading in literature courses, and I listed \"Mein Kampf\",\nand they were horrified. And I said, \"Well, it's one\nof the most important books of the 20th century.\" I mean, six million Jews died, enormous number of other people died, because one guy wrote a\nbook called \"Mein Kampf\", and took it seriously. It's one of the most\nimportant books ever written. How can an educated person not have at least breezed\nthrough \"Mein Kampf\"? - It's not a great read, though. - It's not a great read.\nHe was not a great writer. But you do get a sense for the sociopath that was Adolf Hitler. - Yes, because he really acted\non the words that he wrote. - [Harvey] Yeah. - And it was there, and if\npeople took that work seriously, they would've understood. - It's one of the most important\nbooks of the 20th century, and it's politically incorrect to read it. It's crazy. - But can you speak to the efforts to increase\ndiversity in universities, which I think is embodied in\nthis D-I-E effort of diversity, inclusion and equity programs. Where do they go right?\nWhere do they go wrong? - Okay, let me tell you, first of all. This may surprise a lot of people. I am opposed to affirmative action. And I think that what it does is it labels people by their race, by their religion, and by their national origin. Precisely what we don't want people to do is be pigeonholed in those categories. The reason that affirmative\naction has become the way that universities\ndecide on who gets admitted is because, historically, people in what's called\n\"marginalized groups\", Blacks, gays, Hispanics, have been discriminated against,\nin the admissions process. Now, what I have suggested is that instead of affirmative\naction, and by the way, here's a prediction. The Supreme Court is going to\nabolish affirmative action. There's a case pending, this Harvard case. There are two cases joined together. One of a public university and\none of a private university. The private university is Harvard. I predict that the Supreme\nCourt will vote six to three to abolish affirmative action. On its face, it is a violation of equal protection of the law. Some groups are favored\nbecause of race or ethnicity. It is a classic violation\nof equal protection clause. When affirmative action was approved, the deciding vote was\nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor. She wrote a very famous\nopinion in which she said, \"I am hesitate to vote\nto affirm the notion of affirmative action\nbecause it's such an obvious violation of equal protection. But we have an urgent\nproblem in the society. We are not educating our members of racial and ethnic minorities, and we have to try to get\nthem into our colleges. So, I think it should be\napproved for 25 years. In 25 years, it should\nhave performed its role.\" Well, it hasn't. And the 25 years is coming up. I think it's three or four years left. The Supreme Court is going to abolish it. You can take my word for that. 'Cause it is such an obvious\nviolation of equal protection. Why did affirmative action come into play? Because the secondary in\nelementary schools were so bad. Public, secondary and\nelementary schools were so bad. Why are they so bad? Partly because of the control\nthat the teachers union has. Randi Weingarten runs\nthe public school system in the United States. And what I have suggested is that the effort should be to... This is a national emergency, to improve the quality of elementary\nand secondary education. And one way to do it is to hire teachers who are fabulous teachers, rather than necessarily\nmembers of the union. I have come to oppose public workers unions. I am a very strong supporter of unions in the private sector. Why do I think there's such\na difference between unions in the public sector\nand the private sector? In the private sector,\nmanagement is arguing, bargaining with its own money, and with the money of shareholders. In the public sector,\nthere's only one side. There is the teachers union, and then there's a school\ncommittee that is dealing with the taxpayers' money, not their own. And so it's a very skewed power balance. So, as supportive as I am\nof private sector unions, I am in opposition of\npublic sector unions. They're very destructive. And I think without teachers union, teachers who are really skilled\nwill be able to get jobs. They would not have to worry\nabout the seniority of teachers who long since have given\nup really creative teaching. And we have to improve the\npublic educational system. My late wife and I had a classmate of, we\nhave a son who's now 44, who went to the public\nschools in Cambridge. He has a friend, first name Eugene, who was a Black kid from\nRoxbury, whose mother understood that the schools in Roxbury were terrible, the schools in Cambridge were pretty good. He lived in our house, Monday to Friday, and he\nwent to school with Isaac in the Cambridge public schools. Elsa and I would show up to\nschool committee meetings when there was bargaining\nbetween the teachers union and the school committee. The teachers union objected\nto our being there. We argued, we're taxpayers.\nWe have a kid in the school. His best friend lives with us\nand goes to school with him. We have a real interest. The school committee walked\nout of the bargaining session. The city council then\nreconsidered its vote and they voted that citizens, taxpayers, parents of kids in the school, could not show up to these\nnegotiation sessions. I thought that was absolutely outrageous. But I understood why, because\nthese contracts are crazy. No sane municipality should enter into some of these contracts. And so, I have become an opponent of the National Teachers Association, the Cambridge Teachers Association. I don't think there should be\nunions for public employees because there's no real\nbargaining going on, and I think that the public school system will never be improved, as long as the teachers are unionized. - So that, to you, is at\nthe core of the problem that results in the kind of\ninequality of opportunity that affirmative action\nis designed to solve. - If the educational\nsystem in the elementary and high school levels is improved, we wouldn't need affirmative action. These kids would get good educations. - So, from all backgrounds, poor kids in the United States\nwould get good education, if public unions are abolished. - [Harvey] Correct. - But do you- - [Harvey] And incidentally,\nthe postal service would probably work better, too. (Lex chuckles) - That's a whole other conversation. But do you, at the core of\nthe problem of the inequality in universities, that diversity, inclusion\nand equity programs they're trying to solve is\nthe public education system. - Correct.\n- Secondary education. - [Harvey] Yes, correct.\nElementary and secondary. - Elementary and secondary education. - Well, then is there\nuse? What is the benefit? What is the drawback of D-I-E, diversity inclusion and equity programs, at universities like Harvard? - It's an affirmative action, basically. And what it does is it allows\nthe system of elementary and secondary education to be bad, because they could say, \"Oh,\nwe got our kids into Harvard.\" Yes, but you haven't educated them. And it covers up the wound. And I think we will never improve, as long as we're able\nto cover up the wound. And as I said, affirmative\naction is gonna be abolished by the Supreme Court. It's a clear violation\nof equal protection. It's what Sandra Day O'Connor\nunderstood, but ignored, intentionally, but as an experiment. And I believe it's gonna be abolished. That that's gonna force the elementary and high\nschools to get serious. - Do you see the same issues\nthat you discuss now at Harvard at MIT? We're here in Boston,\nso I have to talk about the great universities here in Boston. You've written about MIT. It's the university I love.\nI'm a research scientist there. Do you see the same kind of issues there? - Yes, I do. - Do you remember or\ncan you explain the case of Dorian Abbot lecture\nthat was canceled at MIT? - Yeah, well, this is not the only... It's not the only incident. There have been incidents\nall around the country of academics, professors who have used, that don't comport with the,\nas the great Lillian Hellman, another friend of my late wife, said, she said she refused to cut her garments, in order to fit the fashions of the day. Dorian Abbot didn't cut his suit to fit the fashions of the\nday, his intellectual suit. And so this has happened at Princeton, this has happened at Harvard,\nthis has happened at MIT. The great universities in\nthe country have decided that the clash of ideas\nis not such a good idea, because some people's\nfeelings will be hurt. Well, there was quite a revolt against it. FIRE sounded the alarm. And then, in the end,\nthe universities were, I believe Abbot was invited to come back. I think he turned them down. He shouldn't have turned\nthem down, but he did. And when the light is cast\nupon these situations, the universities back down,\n'cause they're so embarrassed. - [Lex] Yeah. - And the newspapers,\nbecause newspapers depend on the First Amendment in order to exist, newspapers tend to give\npretty good publicity to these cases of censorship. - [Lex] So they grill the universities. - Yes. - [Lex] So they really emphasized, they catalyzed the embarrassment. - Yes. - [Lex] So is that one of the ways, is that the best way to fight all of this? - Yes. Sunshine is the best disinfectant. - You've written about MIT's\nconnection to Jeffrey Epstein. He was well connected\nat MIT and at Harvard. What lessons do you\ndraw about human nature, about universities, about\nall of this from this saga? - Let me say this. I believe that universities, if somebody was to, for\nexample, donate to a university and donates on the requirement that the building be named after them. If the university is taking donations and the person is funding a building, and wants the building named after them, the building should be named\nafter him, her or them. Harvard is facing this now\nwith the Sackler building because the Sacklers have become, now, a persona non grata because of their role in producing the opioids that caused huge, scandalous opioid addiction. There are people who want\nto remove the name Sackler from the Sackler Art Museum at Harvard. Larry Bacow, the President\nof Harvard, to his credit, has refused to do that. And if it reminds people\nthat the money was earned through selling opioids, that's good. That's good that people understand that that's where the\nSacklers got their money. They should be re reminded. In my undergraduate alma mater, Princeton, there's a movement to remove\nthe name Woodrow Wilson, because Wilson was president at Princeton, before he became governor of New Jersey, before he became President\nof the United States. How he got to be Governor\nof New Jersey was, he was so insufferable that\nthe trustees of Princeton got him the nomination to run\nfor Governor of New Jersey. They had said, \"We gotta\nget this guy outta here.\" And not 'cause he was\nanti-Black and anti-Semitic, 'cause the trustees were, as well, but because he just was insufferable, he drove the faculty crazy\nand they got him out. And so Princeton was thinking\nof changing the name. I wrote a letter to President\nEisgruber at Princeton saying, \"This is part of the university's history. You don't wanna... You wanna rewrite history falsely? Woodrow Wilson was the\npresident of this institution. He was one of your predecessors.\" He never answered me, either. I think these people, they\nknow they have no answer. The reason I didn't get a\nresponse from President Eisgruber is the same as the reason\nI didn't get a response from the headmaster of Milton Academy. They understand that what\nthey're doing is violative of the fundamental precepts\nof academic institutions. They're ashamed, yet they feel\nthey have no choice because they feel that they would\nbe criticized for racism, homophobia, blah, blah,\nblah, blah, blah, blah, blah. - [Lex] Criticized by how many people? - Well, they feel that they\nwould be criticized by students and parents and donors. I disagree with that. I actually think there\nare more people out there that agree with me than agree with them. - Yeah, by a large margin. - By a large margin, in\nwhat I call the real world, which is the world outside the campus. But academics are afraid\nthey'd be criticized. They're incredibly thin skinned. When I say academics, I mean\nacademic administrators. They're very thin skinned,\npolitically correct. Holier than thou. As I said, I would fire 95% of them, and I would be more\ncareful in who I elected to lead these institutions. So, I said Claudine Gay is probably gonna be a disaster at Harvard. - So it takes guts, it takes courage, to be in the administration when the task of protecting\nthe freedom of speech is there. And also, which in part requires you to admit and to uphold the mistakes you have done in the past. - Correct!\n- Not to hide them. - [Harvey] Correct. - And that, to you, I mean,\nJeffrey Epstein for Harvard, and for MIT is a very recent mistake. - Well, there's a debate\nwhether it's a mistake. They took money from him. - Yes.\n- Okay. Is it a mistake to take\nmoney from bad people? Do you have to do a morals\ntest of a potential donor? I don't think so. - It's complicated because- - If there are no\nconditions attached to it, I think it's emotionally complicated. I don't think that it is\nrationally complicated. It's emotionally complicated. It's particularly complicated\nif they want naming rights. \"The Jeffrey Epstein\nBiological Laboratory\". That would be a problem\nfor most universities. I don't think that naming\nrights have to be given to somebody that you don't think is worthy of having their name. I think the university\nhas the right to say, \"No, we'll take your\nmoney, but we will not name the building after you.\" I think they have a right to do that. - There's some degree in which you whitewash the name, though. Not with naming rights, but... - [Harvey] If you take the money? - If you take the money,\nit allows the person, in public discourse to say\nthat they're collaborating, they're working together\nwith Harvard and with MIT. - Well, I have a problem with universities making morals tests of donors, because not every donor\nis as bad as Epstein, but some of the donors made\ntheir money in industry, by being rapacious, by paying low wages, by exploiting people. - You can make the case that accepting money from the\nDepartment of Defense, from DARPA, from the United States\norganizations that contributed to waging war and killing\nhundreds of thousands of civilians over the past few decades. - [Harvey] Correct. - Folks like the tenured\nprofessor Noam Chomsky will make the case that is far more evil than accepting money from Jeffrey Epstein. - [Harvey] Yes. - Still, Jeffrey Epstein\nis a known pedophile. - Yes. So, that's why I say I would\nnot give him naming rights. I think the university has the autonomy to not give naming rights, but I think that giving\nmorals tests to donors is a Pandora's box. - What do you think about the aftermath of the Jeffrey Epstein saga? It feels like... I'm not familiar with Harvard's response, but MIT's response seemed to fire a few scapegoats and it didn't seem like a genuine response to the evils that human\nbeings are capable of. Sort of like rising to the surface, the description in a fully transparent way of all the interactions that\nhappened with Jeffrey Epstein and what that means. Yeah, what that means\nabout the role of money in universities, what\nthat means about just human beings in power. - Money is essential to run a university. One of the reasons it's essential\nis because the university is artificially, artificially requires\nhuge amounts of money, and that's partly because\nof the administrative army that they support and they would be less dependent\non the Jeffrey Epsteins of the world if they didn't have... So, it's sort of all\npart of the same circle. - But there's a tension here. You're saying we shouldn't be putting a morals test on money,\nbut actually if you make, if you expand the amount of money needed to run the university, you're going to make less and less, more and more unethical\ndecisions in terms of accepting- - And as I said, I am\nflexible enough to say that I don't think I would\nname a building after somebody who was truly evil. I think university has the right to limit the naming rights for a donor. If I was an absolutist, I\nwould not even say that, but I'm not an absolutist. I have my limits. And that's one of them. \"The Jeffrey Epstein\nBiological Laboratory\". It's a little bit much. - It feels like there\nshould be moral requirements on who to accept money from,\nbut the concern you have was about who gets to decide\nand what's the alternative? - Correct. I think\nthere is no alternative. I think that turning down a donation because you don't approve\nof the conduct of the donor is a Pandora's box. (Lex breathes deeply) - But I'm just sickened by the\nfact that an evil human being was allowed to walk in the\nhalls of a university I love. So, what do we do with that? - Well, are you telling me that none of the students are evil? Are you telling me none of\nthe faculty members are evil? Are you telling me some none\nof the administrators are evil? - But that doesn't... Sure, sure. So, scapegoating saying\nthat Jeffrey Epstein is evil can help us forget, can\naid us in forgetting that there is other evil\nin the world and some of it might be roaming, still, the\nhalls of MIT and Harvard. - Hey, listen, I won't tell you the name, but I represented somebody\nin the MIT administration a few years ago who is charged\nwith sexual improprieties against students. And as a lawyer, I\nrepresented that person. People said, \"How could you represent...\" Some of the people I\nrepresent are bad people. Say, \"How can you represent?\" I said, \"Well, if I was a cardiologist and this person had a\nheart attack on the street and I didn't deliver CPR, I would have my license taken away.\" I'm a lawyer. The only difference between my obligation and the doctor's obligation\nis the constitution gives people the right\nto assistance of counsel. The Constitution says nothing about the assistance of cardiologists. I have a very high duty to\nrepresent unpopular people. Well, I think I apply the same\ntest to the college donors. The university should\nnot have a morals test to whose money to take. I do draw a line about\nnaming rights of buildings. And as I say, that's an\ninconsistency with my absolutism. But I just, emotionally, I\njust can't deal with having, as I said, \"The Jeffrey\nEpstein Biological Laboratory\". - Well, for me emotionally,\nthere's nothing that sickens me more in the university\nthan the abuse of power. - [Harvey] Right and there's\nan awful lot of people who abuse power at the university. - And especially when it comes\nto abuse power over students. So, sexual harassment. So, in the realm of sexual abuse of power, and all kinds of other. - Well, it is a crime to\nuse one's power position, in order to take sexual\nadvantage of a student. It's a crime.\n- Yeah. - This is not a closed question. - Yeah, but there's a legal crime, and there's a deeply ethical crime, and there's an emotional\nresponse that I have. You are a good lawyer and perhaps a\ngood man to want to defend some folks who are evil in this world. I don't think I have\nthat emotional fortitude. - [Harvey] Well, then you shouldn't be a criminal defense lawyer,\nor a cardiologist. (laughs) - I think you're right. (both laugh) I'm still deeply sickened\nby Jeffrey Epstein and the faculty, the administration that still might be in these\ngreat American universities that are abusing their power,\nin small ways and big ways. But that's human nature. You get a little bit of power, and you're a bad man or a bad woman, and you take advantage of it. - [Harvey] Yep. - We see that in the smallest of ways, and in the biggest of ways. In institutions and regimes,\nall across the world. (sighs) Boy. Harvey, it's a complicated situation. - Well, it's a complicated world, and it's complicated to be a human being, and this is nothing new. - And we should talk about\nit, without restriction. All right. Just to linger on liberal arts. In 2014, and probably still today, you wrote that liberals are\nkilling the liberal arts. - Yes.\n- So can you explain? - Yes. I'm a political liberal. The problem with the political left is that it has divided between what's called\n\"progressives\" and \"liberals\". Liberals are people of\nthe left who believe in the First Amendment, an\nabsolute First Amendment, and in due process of law. The problem with progressives now in the pursuit of equality, what they view as equality, they're willing to bend those rules. And this movement actually\nstarted in Brandeis. It's the critical race theory. Herbert Marcuse was a\nprofessor at Brandeis and he came up with this theory. The theory was this. This\nis right out of Orwell. In order to create true equality in a society where you\nhave some downtrodden and some who are the ubermenschen, in order to create real equality, you have to reduce the\nrights of the upper classes, and artificially increase the\nrights of the lower classes. That will produce, out of unequal treatment, true equality will be attained. This is nonsense. The idea of discrimination producing true equality is nonsense. My view is, as I've said\nearlier in our discussion, that the way to increase the opportunities for the lower classes is to give them real educations. And until we do that,\nit's not gonna happen. And in order to do that,\nwe have to overcome the problem of the teachers\nunions at the elementary and secondary school levels. Until we're willing to do that honestly, and improve those schools, we're gonna have a problem\nof large number of uneducated people who need a boost because we haven't given\nthem proper educations. - What do you think about\nsome of the more controversial faculty in the world? So, an example of somebody\nI've spoken with many times, on mic and offline, is Jordan Peterson. I'm not sure if you're\nfamiliar with his work. But he is an outspoken critic of, or proponent of free speech on campus, and he's been attacked quite a bit. He's a controversial figure. What's the role of the\nuniversity to protect the Jordan Petersons of the world? - I think the university\nhas an absolute, absolute, not relative, that absolute obligation to protect the academic freedom of even the most\ncontroversial faculty members. And you can imagine,\non a university campus, you have more people who are outliers than you do in the general population. - [Lex] That's the hope, at least. - Hopefully. Yeah. And those outliers have to be protected. They can't be pressured,\nthey can't be fired, they can't be disabled\nfrom spewing their views, whether they're considered racist, whether they're considered\nto promote an idea of human society that's\nconsidered obnoxious. It doesn't matter. If you can't have freedom of thought on the college campuses, where can you? Then we're lost. As a society, we're lost. And as an educational institution, educational institutions\nno longer will educate. They will indoctrinate. That, we have to avoid at all costs. - And we should also\nremember that the outlier might also be the only bearer of truth. So, in Nazi Germany, speaking\nagainst the fascist regime. In communist Soviet Union,\nspeaking against communism. They might hold the key to the solving the ailments of that society. - Absolutely. And some of the most important\ndiscoveries in science, for example, were mocked at the beginning. I mean, think of poor Charlie Darwin. - \"Charlie\". (chuckles) I see he is on nickname levels with you. Well, 'cause we're talking\nabout these big topics of sexism or racism and hate. We should not forget\nabout the smaller topics, which might even have\nthe much bigger impact, which is what you're speaking to, which is outlier ideas in science. So, basically welcoming\ncontroversial ideas in science. And by \"controversial\", I mean just stuff that most of the community\ndoesn't agree on. It doesn't actually harm anyone at all. But even then, there's always pressure. One of the things I'm\nreally concerned about is how little power young faculty have. That there's a kind of\nhierarchy, seniority, that universities have,\nempowered by the administration, where young faculty that\ncome in, they're kind of, um- - [Harvey] Pre-tenured. - Yeah, there's a\nprocess in chasing tenure where you're kind of supposed to behave, and there's an incentive\nto kind of fit in, and to not be an outcast, and that's a really huge\nproblem because, oftentimes, the youth is when the\ncraziest, the biggest ideas, the revolutionary ideas come\nand if you're forced to behave and fit in and not speak out, then even in the realm of science, the innovation is stifled. - Well, now you trigger my,\nhappy to tell you this story. - [Lex] You're triggered. This is good. - In the mid 1980s, I\ndecided to take a four-month sabbatical from my law practice. - [Lex] Yes. - Professor James Vorenberg, who was at the time Dean\nof the Harvard Law School, heard about it, heard\nabout it from his wife, Elizabeth Betty Vorenberg,\nwhom I was very friendly with, because we were both on the\nACLU of Massachusetts board, at the time. And so Betty told Jim that\nHarvey was taking a sabbatical. Jim called Harvey and asked\nHarvey if he would like to teach a course at the Harvard Law\nSchool because there was nobody who had teaching criminal\nlaw from the perspective of somebody who actually\nwas in court and litigated. It was all theoretical. I said, \"Sure, I'll do it.\" So, I taught a semester\nat Harvard Law School. The student evaluations\nwere fabulous. Why? Because it was really interesting. They were hearing a lawyer\nwho's talking about real cases. I actually brought in a few of my clients to some of the classes. And so Jim called me in and said, \"Harvey, the students love this course. I'd like to offer you a tenure track position at the law school. You'd have to give up your law practice.\" I turned him down. He said, \"Did you just say 'No'?\" I said, \"Yes, I said, 'No.'\" He said, \"How come?\" He says, \"Nobody in my administration has ever turned down a tenure track offer at Harvard Law School.\" I said, \"Because I could\nsee that I'm not a good fit. That the administrators\nare overrun the place. That faculty members,\nespecially untenured, are afraid to say things that might not help them\nin the tenure quest. It's not a good fit for me.\" - [Lex] You saw this in\nthe mid 1980s, already? - Yes, about 1985. And I went back to my law practice. I did not want to get\ninto this meat grinder that I saw. Actually, I started to see it, before the turn of the century, because I co-authored \"The\nShadow University\" in '98, and then co-founded FIRE in '99. I'm an early student of this phenomenon. - What are some other\naspects of this, the book, \"The Shadow University\",\nthat we may have not covered? - Well, let me tell you a story. I believe I tell it in\n\"The Shadow University\", 'cause it was part of- - [Lex] I'm loving these stories, Harvey. - The stories are fabulous. Let me tell you a story of... I did a tour of the\ncountry, visiting campuses. I visited a college\ncalled Hamline University. I believe it was in Indiana or Illinois. Somewhere in the Midwest. And I attended a freshman orientation. Now, listen to this. This was a freshman orientation. The administrators, the deans and the deanettes, and the deputy assistant\ndeans and deanettes, and the third-deputy\nassistant deans and deanettes, lined the students up,\naccording to their skin hues. - [Lex] Oh, boy. - The blonde, blue-eyed\nwhite folks were at one end. The darkest African Americans whose\nbloodlines had not yet mixed with any of the\nwhites, on the other end. And the exercise was, you\nhad to tell how your race affected your success in\nlife, up until that point. I thought it was the most demeaning thing that one could imagine. Demeaning. I thought to myself, \"They could do the same\nabout sexual orientation. They could do the same about religion. They could do the same\nabout national origin. It would be demeaning, no matter what.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - And the students actually verbalized how their race had either been a plus or a minus. - They did it?\n- They did. And I thought it was so demeaning. It just confirmed all of my\ndistaste for this kind of, this kind of approach. - Let me ask you from\nthe interviewer seat. So, I get to do this podcast\nand I often have to think about giving a large platform\nand having a conversation with very controversial figures, and the level of controversy\nhas been slowly increasing. What's the role of this medium, to you? This medium of speech between two people, and me speaking with a\ncontroversial figure. Me, or some other interviewer. What's the role of giving\nplatform to controversial figures? Say, members of the KKK, or dictators, people who are seen as evil? - Well, we want face\nthe world with reality. And the reality is that\nthere is some unpleasantness, unpleasantnesses in the world. Running from genocide, right through to ordinary\ndiscrimination, to offensiveness. It's the real world, as we know it exists. Are we afraid to say it? Do we wanna make people\nthink that we live in a world where those words are not used? Where those animosities don't exist? The answer is no. - But you can whitewash, you can normalize the use of those words, and you can whitewash the\nacceptability of certain leaders. So, for example, interviewing\nHitler in 1938, 1935, 1936, 1937, '38, those are all\ndifferent dynamics there, but you can normalize this\nperson, and in so doing, create enormous harm. - Well, see, I don't\nsee it as normalizing. I see it as exposing. If more people had taken\n\"Mein Kampf\" seriously, Franklin Roosevelt\nwould've acted much sooner. He only got us into the war, asked Congress get us into the war, when the Japanese made the mistake of attacking Pearl Harbor. But there were some people\nin the State Department, there were some people\nin the administration who were trying to get Roosevelt to see what Hitler was really like, and he was blind to it! And this was one of\nthe greatest presidents the United States ever had. He was blind to it, until the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. So, I think that words, unpleasant ideas, as expressed by words are essential for communicating\nfact and truth and reality. And that's why I think that we should not whitewash language. We should not whitewash the\nfact that Jeffrey Epstein was pretty close to MIT. - And Harvard.\n- And Harvard. And reality, reality\nactually means something. - Yeah, but from the\nrole of the interviewer, that's something I have\nto think a lot about. Whether interviewing Hitler,\nyou said \"exposing\"... I think it's hard to know\nwhat Hitler's like in a room, but it's also hard to know,\nI've never met Jeffrey Epstein, it's hard to know what Jeffrey\nEpstein's like in a room, but I imagine, to some degree\nthey're charismatic figures. So exposing them in the interview setting is not an easy task. - Well, interviewing is not an easy- - All right.\n- Job. - [Lex] Yeah. - [Harvey] It's not a good idea to have an interviewer be an idiot. (Lex laughs) - I know exactly what you're saying, and I know why you're looking\nat me directly as you say it. I appreciate that, Harvey.\nAll right. (chuckles) Let me ask about your\nfriend, your colleague, Alan Dershowitz. And I'll also ask about your\nreview of his most recent book. But before then, it'd be interesting to ask what you think of him\nas a human being, as a lawyer. He's quite an interesting case. He's represented some of the most controversial figures in history. - Including Jeffrey Epstein.\n- Including Jeffrey Epstein. Mike Tyson, Julian Assange, Jim Baker, and Jeffrey Epstein,\nand even Donald Trump. So, he's an interesting figure. What do you think about that? - Claus von Bulow. - What do you think? What do you think about him\nas a human being, as a lawyer? What he represents, in\nterms of values and ideals? - Well, he is a criminal defense lawyer, and the job of a criminal defense lawyer is to represent accused criminals. He is a lifelong Democrat. He didn't represent Trump because he agrees with him politically. - Voted for Hillary, I believe you wrote. - He voted for Hillary.\nYes, that's what he says. And I absolutely believe\nit. He's a liberal Democrat. But he's a criminal defense\nlawyer, as well as a professor. And I've represented some very\nnasty people, in my career. I wouldn't go out for coffee with them, but they have constitutional\nrights to representation. - [Lex] And you take that very seriously. - Yes, you notice something that people don't understand about Dershowitz. He was asked by Trump to represent him in the second impeachment, as well. He turned him down. Why do\nyou think he turned him down? - So, people should know\nhe represented Trump in the first impeachment. - He represented him, only in the first, and he was successful, and when Trump was\nimpeached the second time, he asked Alan to represent him. Alan has had a lifelong policy of only representing somebody once. Never twice. Why? Because he never wanted to be\nhouse counsel to the mafia. So, he early on had this position. He only represents somebody once. The mafia wants a lawyer\nwho's an in-house counsel who represents them in all their cases. So, that's the reason and\nAlan never publicly explained that I know it's a fact,\n'cause I've known him from the day that we met at\nHarvard Law School in 1964. He was a first-year professor. I was a first-year student. We both had Brooklyn\naccents and we hit it off. We've been close friends, ever since. - So there's some kind of\nunethical line that's crossed when you continuously represent a client. - Yeah. He thought it was\nnot so much an ethical line. You have a right to\nrepresent mafia people, but he didn't want to be house counsel. He didn't want to have\nthem ask him for advice, in advance of what they were doing. He was willing to represent somebody once, no matter how awful. Claus von Bulow was accused\nof killing his wife. These are pretty nasty people. But he didn't want to be\nhouse counsel to any of them. - So, you wrote a review of\nAlan Dershowitz's new book on Donald Trump. The title of that book is, \"Get Trump: the Threat to Civil Liberties, Due Process and Our\nConstitutional Rule of Law\". Can you summarize this\nbook and your review of it? - Yes. By the way, I co-authored it\nwith my research assistant, who's sitting right here. - Emily?\n- Yes. I thought that the book was\nanother example of the fact that everybody's entitled\nto a defense and that Alan's being involved with Trump\nwas purely professional. It was not political. It\nwas not philosophical. And I thought that the fact\nthat he was being criticized, he was being shunned, because\nof his connection to Trump, I found very interesting\nthat this is a guy who represented such, I'll call them distasteful figures, as Claus von Bulow, as Mike Tyson, as OJ Simpson, as Sheldon Siegel. And when he was considered\nto be a skillful lawyer, made his reputation. And then he represents Donald\nTrump, who to my knowledge, never killed anybody, and he's suddenly shunned. I thought the hypocrisy of\nit, the political preening, was very distasteful to me. And it was not only\n'cause he was my friend. If he wasn't my friend, I\nthink I'd have the same view. The \"holier than thou\" nonsense. The hypocrisy of it. They wouldn't talk to him\non Martha's Vineyard now. Alan and I are different.\nI'm not so sensitive. Someone doesn't wanna\ntalk to me? No problem. No problem at all. But Alan, considering how\ncontroversial his life has been, - He's somewhat sensitive.\n- He's somewhat sensitive. And I've kept just telling Alan, \"Alan, don't let it get to you.\" - Hey. I can relate, I\ncan definitely relate. Taking on some\ncontroversial conversations. Still wear my heart on\nmy sleeve. It hurts. All of it hurts.\n- Yep. - But maybe the pain makes you a better student of human nature. Maybe that's the case for him. Nevertheless, the book makes a complicated and I think an interesting point. He opens the book with, \"Now that Donald Trump has\nannounced his candidacy for reelection as president,\nthe unremitting efforts by his political opponents\nto, quote, get him, to stop him from running, at\nany cost, will only increase. These efforts may pose the\nmost significant threat to civil liberty since McCarthyism.\" So, is he right?\n- He's absolutely right. Because these attempted... For example, the prosecution, the one prosecution that has\nbeen brought now, Alvin Bragg, in the Manhattan. I have looked at that, and I don't believe that\nTrump has committed a crime, and yet Bragg was pressured to bring that. People in his office\nwere threatening to quit, if he didn't indict. Wholly improper, wholly unethical, and he's gonna lose the case. Has Trump committed crimes? Yes. Mostly, they're tax crimes. He has cheated on taxes, his whole career, as far as I could tell. He could easily be indicted\nfor state and federal taxes, but they're not as sexy. And I think that he's become a target by ambitious politicians,\nambitious prosecutors. He has gotten some sympathy,\nwhich he doesn't deserve. and a lot of it is, pardon the phrase, political correctness. The better people are not\nsupposed to be Trumpers. I had an interesting\nexperience about Trump. I had two interesting experiences. The more recent one was\nI was in the house of Lawrence Summers, the\nformer president of Harvard, who was driven out by political\ncorrectness, by the way. He insulted women biologists. I was in his house when he was\nstill President of Harvard, when the Trump/Hillary\nClinton contest took place. And I was with Elsa. We were invited to Summers' house, in Brookline, and it looked like Hillary was gonna win, and the Harvard faculty members,\nthey were all celebrating, they were all figuring out\nwhat their cabinet positions were gonna be, blah,\nblah, blah, blah, blah. And then, at about 11:30 at night, all of a sudden, it was announced that, in terms of electoral votes, Trump had just eked out of a victory. That Hillary beat him in the popular vote, but he had won the electoral college, and there was an immediate depression. - [Lex] Meaning like quiet over the room? - The room became absolutely stone-silent. And they were all, you know, disappointed. Well, that was a memorable moment. And it told me that they were a little bit too overconfident. They were savoring being part of a\npresidential administration. Ambition had been thwarted. I'm not a great fan of preening ambition. I think it blinds people to realities. - [Lex] And the resulting\narrogance from such ambition. - And the arrogance, yes. It's one of the reasons I\ndidn't accept Jim Vorenberg's offer to be part of\nthe academic community. I mean, I represent professors, I had friends who were professors. I represent students, I have\nfriends who are students, and I have a great\nregard for universities, and higher education. But I was not about to\nbecome part of the culture. I thought that it was not good for me, and not good for the institution, either. - A culture that can breed arrogance. - Yes.\n- Self importance. - [Harvey] Yep. - And I, in a sense, the election of Donald Trump\nwas a big F.U. to such- - Correct. Which is why I think he, why I think he managed to pull it off. - To jump topics a little bit, what do you think about\nsomething you've written about, what do you think about the\nmass surveillance programs by the NSA and also probably\nby other organizations, CIA, FBI, and others? And broadly, what do you think about the importance of privacy\nfor the American citizen? - Okay. I believe that the FBI should be abolished. 'Cause I believe that its\nculture was so corrupted by its first director, John Edgar Hoover, J. Edgar Hoover, that it is impossible to reform the FBI to make its agents honest, to force them to obey the constitution. The First, Fourth and Fifth\namendments, especially. And it's a culture that cannot be changed. Hoover established the culture\nand no FBI director since has been able to change it. If you go online, I did, on YouTube, a video, for the ACLU of Massachusetts. It was when I was on the board. It was probably when I was\npresident of the board. I was president of the\nboard for two years. I was on the board for 20 years. And I did a video about advising\npeople to never, ever, ever talk to an FBI agent, when they come knocking on your door. - Can you briefly explain the intuition why not to talk to an FBI agent? - They have a system. When they come in and interview you, two agents show up, never one. One asks the question.\nThe other one takes notes. The note-taking agent\ntakes notes and it goes back to the office and types\nup a report called a Form 302, which is the official record\nof what was asked and answered. So, when I have a client\ninterviewed by the FBI, I show up, and I always agree, almost\nalways agree to the interview. But I bring a tape recorder. And I say, \"All right,\nI'm gonna tape this.\" And they say, \"Well, by regulation, we're not allowed to do the\ninterview if it's taped. The record is the 302,\nthe agent's taking notes.\" I say, \"Well, I have a policy, too. My policy is to never allow\na client to be interviewed, unless it's recorded. So, it's unfortunate, but we're gonna have to end this meeting.\" And the agents get up and leave. And I have never seen a Form 302 that I consider to be accurate. The agents write down what\nthey wish you had said. Rather than what you said. It is a wholly corrupt organization that has not gotten any\nbetter since Hoover died. - [Lex] And fundamentally, the\ncorruption is in the culture that is resisting the\nConstitution of the United States. The First and Fourth and Fifth amendments. - Correct. It's not financial corruption. It is corruption of the mission. And I think it should be abolished. And if we need a federal\ninvestigative agency, it should be a new name, a new\nculture, wholly new members, a new director. It's impossible to reform the FBI. - Can you elaborate on what\nexactly is broken about the FBI? Is it the famous saying, from Stalin's KGB head, Beria, \"Show me the man and\nI'll show you the crime\"? - Right.\n- Is it that kind of process? - It's that kind of process. They decide who's guilty and\nthen they go about concocting a case against a person\nwho they want to get. - [Lex] So, the goal is\nnot to find the truth or- - It's to solve the case and close it, and enhance their reputations. - But to show that an\ninnocent man is guilty is also solving the case,\nfrom their perspective. So, to falsely convict, or falsely imprison an innocent man is also solving the case. - Well, it closes the case, if they falsely imprison an innocent man. They're interested in closing cases. - So, that's the FBI, but broadly speaking about the surveillance aspect of this, what are your views on the right that an American citizen has to privacy? - Well, wire tapping and\nelectronic surveillance are very, very intrusive. And I think that the circumstance that these tools are\nused should be narrowed. For example, they're used\nin a lot of drug cases. Since I don't think drugs\nshould be illegal in any event, I certainly think that it's a\nterrible violation of privacy to use wire tapping in a drug case. I could see it in cases of murder, possibly in cases of serious extortion, but on other kinds of kinds\nof crimes where they wire tap, especially drug cases, I believe drugs should\nall be legalized anyway, I think it's... The price we pay as\nsociety is not worth it. - On the Wikipedia page for\n\"Nothing to hide\", you're cited. In fact, your book that you gave me today, \"Three Felonies A Day\", is cited. So, \"nothing to hide\" argument. That's an argument that if\nyou're a well-behaved citizen, you have nothing to hide, and therefore your\nprivacy can be violated. - Well, the problem is that\nunder the federal criminal code, particularly the federal criminal code, it is very easy to be\ncharged with a crime. Now, why? Under the Constitution, the Federal Government does not have plenary criminal jurisdiction. That's up to the state. How is it that the feds indict, in so many areas of American life? It's because the Supreme Court\nhas allowed the following absolutely insane situation to prevail. Anything can be made a federal crime, if, in the course of the\ncommission of the crime, the means of interstate\ncommunication or travel are used. That means that if you commit a crime, which ordinarily would be a state crime, and you use the telephone\nor you send a letter, it suddenly becomes federal. That means that the limitation\nthat the founding fathers who wrote the Constitution intended to keep the feds out of daily life and to give that jurisdiction to the state has been completely thwarted. 'Cause I can't think of the a case where somebody doesn't use a telephone, in the course of planning, discussing something\nthat's arguably criminal. And so this limited authority,\nthe federal government, to bring charges in\ncriminal cases, is illusory. The feds can indict a ham sandwich. - So basically, everybody's\nguilty, and if the, if the feds wanna bring you in, they can. They can find a way.\n- Correct. And that allows them to terrorize\npeople who are dissidents. - Yeah. What is broken, what works, about the American criminal justice system,\nfrom your perspective? - [Harvey] The jury system. - The jury system?\n- Yes. - You like the jury system.\nEveryday citizens representing- - 12 ordinary people have\nto agree, unanimously, in order to convict. - What do you think about the\nhighest court in the land, the Supreme Court? What works and what is broken\nabout the Supreme Court, as an institution? What are its strengths and weaknesses? - Well, the Supreme Court is unfortunately fairly political. And the current Supreme Court\nis overruling precedence, which, it's really improper. Precedence should not\nbe overruled so easily. It's about to overrule\nthe affirmative action. Now, I'm opposed to affirmative action. I think I made that clear\nearlier in our discussion, but still, it's a precedent, and it should be given some respect. But in order to, in order to propagate a more conservative agenda, the court is treating precedent as if it doesn't have any role, and that's a huge mistake. Some of the congressmen\non the Democratic side are looking to enlarge the court, in order to basically do\nwhat Franklin Roosevelt was not able to do. And that is, change\nthe court's philosophy. But I think that's very shortsighted, because this is a long game. This is a republic we have here. And anyone who tries to, for example, enlarge\nthe court from 9 to 12, in order to get more\nliberals on the court, then some other administration\nwill try to enlarge it from 12 to 15, to get more\nliberals on the court. You'd have a constant fiddling with a\nvery important institution. - So the law should\nhave more lasting power than the political bickering of the day. - Correct. - Let me ask you, you've\nlived one heck of a life, and fought a lot of battles\nand you continue to do so, with the Harvard Board of Overseers. So, first of all, thank\nyou for that, but uh, we're all human, we're all mortal. Do you ponder your death? Do you ponder your mortality?\nAre you afraid of it? - Well, let me say this.\nMy father died at 48. He died 'cause he smoked. He died at 48 because he smoked\nfour packs of Camels a day. He got a massive heart attack at 43. He continued to smoke, despite that. He died at 48. So, I did not\nexpect to live this long. 'Cause I thought it was genetic. It turns out it was cigarettes. So, here I am, I'm\ngonna be 81 on May 10th. I was born on May 10th, 1942, which is Mother's Day, coincidentally, and I realize I'm not gonna live forever. I also take pride in the\nfact that I have demonstrated that a lawyer does not\nhave to go with a law firm, in order to manage to make it. You can make your own, write\nyour own, what's the word? Write your own ticket. I've done that. I agree that I've had an elite education. I went to Princeton\nand Harvard Law School. But I don't think you have to necessarily go to elite institutions\nin order to really make it. You need to work hard. But you shouldn't put\nyourself in a place where you're not gonna feel\ncomfortable and what's the word? Empowered? Like I refused to take Vorenberg's invitation for tenure track\nposition at Harvard Law School. I'll tell you one other\nstory that illustrates this. I was originally pre-med. My freshman-sophomore years at Princeton, I was in the pre-med program. Why? Because my parents wanted me to marry the daughter\nof our family physician. And the idea was I was\ngonna go to medical school and I was gonna go into\nmedical practice with him in Hackensack, New Jersey. We had moved from Brooklyn at the time. Long story why we had\nto move from Brooklyn. It had to do with my\nfather's having a problem with the Furies Union and\nhaving his life threatened. And we moved to Maywood, New Jersey, 'cause he got a job in a fur\nshop in Passaic, New Jersey. And a family physician,\nthey had three daughters, the oldest of whom was my age. She went to Hackensack High School. I went to Pagoda High School. They're both in North Burton County. And the idea was that she\nand I were gonna marry, I was gonna go to medical\nschool, I was going to become a partner of her father, in his medical practice in Hackensack. When he retired, I was\ngonna inherit the practice. This scenario was concocted\nby Carolyn's mother, and my mother. In my sophomore year at Princeton, I won a fellowship to spend that summer between my sophomore and\njunior year in Paris. I was fluent by then. I had taken an accelerated French course, my freshman-sophomore year. And I went to Paris. It was my first time out of the country. I spent the entire summer working, supporting myself there,\nfirst to pay the airfare, and I earned money for room and board. And I thought about my life\nand I decided, number one, I didn't want to be a physician,\nI wanted to be a lawyer. Number two, I didn't\nwant to marry Carolyn. And I came back, I changed\nfrom pre-med to pre-law. I broke up with Carolyn, who was, by that time,\nat school at Douglas, right down the road from Princeton. She had followed me. Or I had followed her. My life suddenly took a\nwholly different turn. So, that summer, in Paris, Paris had a outsized effect of my life. Every year, the Bravo\nTheater shows \"Casablanca\", where Bogart has this great line. He says, \"We'll always have Paris.\" And I think to myself, I\nalways used to say Elsa, we used to see \"Casablanca\"\nevery Valentine's Day, 'cause it was such an\nimportant movie to me, because Paris was\ntransformative in my life, and we went to Paris, every year. During my vacation, we went to Paris. That was where she took\nsome great pictures of Isaac where he was this high and this high, and they were hanging up in the house. And so I always... And even after Elsa's death, I've seen \"Casablanca\" twice now. She died in 2020. And I always think,\n\"We'll always have Paris.\" - \"We'll always have Paris.\" (Lex breathes deeply) Well, Harvey, like I said, I hope you're\nvery successful in your, in your run for the\nHarvard Board of Overseers. I think what you stand for, in the realm of freedom of speech is I think the thing that\nmakes these universities great institutions in American culture, and I'll do everything I\ncan to help you succeed and I just am really grateful\nfor all the work you've done and I'm grateful that you\nwould talk with me today. This was amazing. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Harvey Silverglate. To support this podcast,\nplease check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you some\nwords from Harry S. Truman. \"Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing\nthe voice of the opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of\nterror to all its citizens, and creates a country where\neveryone lives in fear.\" Thank you for listening and\nI hope to see you next time."
