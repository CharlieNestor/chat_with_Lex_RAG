There is another way.\" (air swooshing) - The following is a\nconversation with Tulsi Gabbard, who was a longtime Democrat, including being the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. She endorsed Bernie in\n2016 and Biden in 2020. She has been both loved\nand heavily criticized for her independent thinking\nand bold political stances, especially on topics of war and the military industrial complex. She served in the U.S.\nmilitary for many years, achieving the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and now she's the author of a new book called \"For Love of Country.\" This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Tulsi Gabbard."

      "text": "You've served in the U.S.\nmilitary for many years, achieving rank of Lieutenant Colonel. You were deployed in Iraq in 2004 and five Kuwait in 2008 and '09. What lessons about life and about country have you learned from\nthat experience of war? - So many. Central to those lessons\nlearned was having my eyes open to the very real cost of war. You know, of course, I\nserved in a medical unit during that first deployment to Iraq. It was 2005 during the height of that war. And unfortunately, we\ntook a lot of casualties. We, across the entire U.S. military, my brigade that I deployed with was from the Hawaii National Guard. We had approximately 3,000\nsoldiers who were operating in four different areas of Iraq. And my first task every day was to go through a list of every injury, combat-related injury that had occurred the day before in the country. And I went through that\nlist, name by name, looking to see if any one of our nearly 3,000 soldiers from Hawaii had been hurt in the line of duty. And then if seeing them on the list, tracking them down, where were they? Were they getting the care they needed? Would they be able to get sufficient care to stay in country and return to duty? Did I need to get them evacuated? Usually it would be to military hospitals that at that time were in launch, Landstuhl and Ramstein in Germany. And then from there, getting them to either\nBrooke Army Medical Center, which is here in Texas that specialized in burn-related injuries, or to Walter Reed, and tracking them and their care until they were finally\nhome with their families. And it never became a routine task. It never became like, \"Okay, cool, check the list,\" you know, kind of dot the I's, cross the T's. It was that daily confrontation with the reality of the cost of war. Friends of mine were killed in combat. Experiencing firsthand\nthat high human cost of war caused me, you know, 20\nsomething year old from Hawaii, I had left my seat in\nthe state legislature to volunteer to deploy with my brothers and sisters in my unit to Iraq. And so recognize the cost of war, I think in two fundamental ways. Number one is the high human\ncost of war on our troops and on the people in the country where this war was being waged, and also the cost on American taxpayers. Seeing then, back, is again 2005, and recognizing KBR Halliburton, one of the biggest defense\ncontracting companies then and I know that they're still very much in that business now, Dick Cheney being\nconnected with that company at one point or another, but in our camp specifically, which was one of the larger\nones in Iraq at that time, there wasn't anything\nthat happened in our camp that didn't have the KBR\nHalliburton logo imprinted on it. We had a big shack-looking\nplace where we ate our meals, they call it a dining facility,\na DFAC in the military. And they served four meals a day. They brought in, and they being KBR Halliburton, they imported workers in\nfrom places like Nepal and Sri Lanka and the Philippines\nto come in and cook food and work at this dining facility. I got curious about how much\nit cost us as taxpayers. And so I started asking\naround some of the people, and I think at that time it was like, Well, every time a soldier or a service member\nwalks through the door, if I were to go in for breakfast and grab a banana and walk out, that's an automatic $35 per head, per meal, four times a day, thousands and thousands of people. And then we made friends, you know. There's a pretty large\nFilipino community in Hawaii, a lot of Filipino soldiers from Hawaii. We made friends with the\nFilipino workers who were there. They would often go in\nlike the back of the tents and set up their own like rice cookers and cook their own meals, which is where the real good food was. But just started talking to them and getting to know them and ask like, \"Hey, how much do you get paid?\" And on average it was like, \"Oh, I get paid like 500 bucks a month,\" 500 bucks a month to go\nand do this work of either, you know, cleaning out\nporta-potties, picking up trash, the dining facility, doing laundry, all of these different tasks because the military wanted\nsoldiers to be out doing things that only soldiers could do. Understandable. But I started putting, you know, two and two together and\nknowing that this company, one company alone, was\nmaking trillions of dollars, trillions of dollars, and yet this Filipino mom\nis making 500 bucks a month, maybe getting one day off a week, maybe, working 12 hours a day otherwise. And I said, you know, \"How often are you able\nto go home to your family? Well, they'll let us go home a couple of weeks every other year.\" It was an eye-opening experience that growing up in Hawaii, I frankly hadn't given\nmuch thought to before, but it's what led me, ultimately, coming back from that first deployment, there was no way that I could go back to the life that I had left behind. And I knew somehow, some way, I needed to find a way\nto use those experiences to try to make a positive impact,\nto try to influence those, I mean, frankly, the politicians who are\nmaking decisions to go and launch these regime change wars and send our men and\nwomen in uniform into war. And to what end, ultimately? - If we can just go back to that list. - [Tulsi] Yeah. - So the list is just name\nand injury, name and injury. - Name, unit, potentially location, if someone had documented\nthat, and their injury. - And it's just pages and pages of that. - Yeah, yeah. And I knew, you know, I didn't\nget to call home every day, but when I called home\nand talked to my parents, I felt the tension in their voice. And, you know, they didn't want me to worry\nabout anything at home. And so they were always like, \"Hey, how are you? What can we send you?\" And this and that. But, you know, it wasn't like I was calling\nthem from down the street and saying, Hey, how's it going? Let's go have lunch or whatever. And so I knew that the\nreason for that tension was they were terrified of\ngetting a phone call delivering the worst possible news. And that was what I thought\nof as I went through that list of how, you know, it\nis the reality of war. Behind every one of those names\non that list was, you know, a husband or a wife, parents,\nyou know, sons and daughters, family members who had no idea what we were dealing with, really. All they knew is what\nthey saw on the news. And what my dad told me\nlater when I got home after that deployment was that\nevery time they saw the news and they saw a helicopter shot down or crashed or some IED, they held their breath until they saw or heard the news of who\nit was or what it was."

      "section": "Battle injuries and PTSD",
      "text": "- What can you say about\nwhat the soldiers had to go through physically\nand psychologically when they get injured? - The physical, you know, I mean, some injuries appeared\nto be minor upfront. At that time, traumatic brain injury was not something that was talked about much, if at all. And so, you know, many had visible wounds. Others are now what we know were, appeared like, \"All right, cool. He checked out,\" but had invisible wounds. Those who were injured in a way that did not allow them\nto get back to work, found it emotionally very difficult to be put on a plane and\nevacuated out of there, feeling guilty that they were\nleaving their friends behind and not thinking about themselves or not feeling bad for themselves, but instead feeling bad for being forced to be in a position to leave. You know, for soldiers, it's not... Of course, we all have our own\npolitical opinions on things, but when it comes right down to it, in a war zone, it's about your friends. It's about your brothers and sisters that you're serving alongside. It's not about the politicians or whatever insanity is\ngoing on in Washington. It's about getting up and going out, getting the job done and\ncoming back home together. I mean, I had friends of\nmine who were from Hawaii, who were from American Samoa, very culturally tight-knit community who confided in me throughout that, you know, year that we were there. Some of the very infantry soldiers who were going out on security patrols and doing raids every day, just some of the very\ntraumatic experiences that they went through. No physical injury, but creating a kind of\nemotional stress and trauma that as human beings, they were\nstruggling in dealing with. On a positive note, you know, the Polynesian culture especially, but also Asian culture and\nother cultures around the world, our guys found that,\nshortly after we got there, the unit that we were replacing, you know, we're taking the guys\nout on patrol and saying, \"Hey, here's this village, here's where we found friendlies,\" or \"here's where we know that there are insurgents operating\" and they've got allies and lookouts and, you know, showing them\nthe lay of the land, basically. And what our guys found was that, as they were doing these ride-alongs, they call it a \"left seat, right seat\" when you're coming in and taking over, that there was a bit of a tense, even adversarial type of relationship where on the military side, there was an assumption of\nsuspicion or lack of trust just with the locally Iraqi people who lived around the base that we were at. And without anybody telling\nthem to, culturally, our guys began trying\nto build relationships and, you know, for Hawaii and Samoa, and we had soldiers from Guam and Saipan, little things like, you're\nriding down in a Humvee, you've got a gunner in the turret with a 50 cal or a\nmachine gun of some sort. Little things like pointing\nthe muzzle to the sky as you're riding through a town, rather than pointing it directly at where people are\nwalking down the street was a huge gesture of an assumption of, Hey, let's actually\ntalk and become friends. We had our guys riding down the street and throwing shakas out\nto the local people there, breaking bread, sharing tea, and building those relationships. And again, I served in a medical unit and what we saw was a\ndownward shift in casualties from the unit that had\nbeen there before us, simply because of that\nbasic human connection that our guys sought to make. And then gradually finding\nlike, hey, local, you know, people who lived in the town\nright next to us were saying, \"Hey, you guys should really... Somebody was digging a big\nhole a mile down the road. You might wanna bypass\nthat or check that out,\" and finding weapons caches and IEDs, improvised explosive\ndevices and other things that helped save people's lives - On the cost side of things, how is it possible for a\ncompany like Halliburton or others to get away with $40 bananas or however much it was, the overhead costs?\n- Yeah. - Look, what they will\nclaim is that it's expensive to move logistics\nthrough a country at war, but they get away with it, ultimately, this insane war profiteering. And they're not alone, obviously. There are other companies that\nthis is their business model. They get away with it because of their political connections and the lobbyists that they have, the relationships they\nhave with politicians, and ultimately, what President Eisenhower warned against with regard to that cozy\nrelationship between Congress and even what he called then \"the military industrial complex.\" It's been alive and well,\nhe warned us against it, and I would say it's thriving more now than ever before. - How powerful is the\nmilitary industrial complex? As a thing, is it a machine\nthat can be slowed down, can be stopped, can be reversed? - It can be. It's powerful. I don't think you can overstate\nthe powerful nature of it because it extends so deeply\nwithin our government. It's not just those in\nthese specific big defense contracting companies\nthat benefit from it. You look at the revolving door within the Pentagon, for example, where you have both high ranking people who wear military uniforms as well as those who serve as high ranking Department\nof Defense civilians, who are literally working their way into a big payout when\nthey leave that job. We see it with our own\nSecretary of Defense now. He retired as a general officer, went and served on one of the boards for one of the big defense contractors, and then now back as the\nSecretary of Defense. We see the same thing in\nCongress with members of Congress and senior professional\nstaffers in Congress. Same exact revolving door\nwhere you have people, whether they're writing contracts for the Department of Defense, for the company that then\nwins the bid for that contract and then going and\nworking for that company, or those in Congress\nwho are writing policies and doing exactly the same thing."

      "section": "War on terrorism",
      "text": "- You have been both a war\nhawk and war dove at times. So what is your philosophy on when war is justified\nand when it is not? - War is justified when it is in the best interest of\nour national security and when it is the last resort, when all diplomatic efforts have been completed and exhausted and war is the last possible route that must be taken to\nensure the safety, security, and freedom of the American people. - So that's a high level beautiful ideal, but there's messy details. So terrorism, for example, - Yes. - The United States' involvement in the war in Iraq and\nAfghanistan was, in part, the big umbrella of the war on terrorism. So, you know, when you decide whether something's justified or not and whether something\ncan be defeated or not, how hard is it, is it even possible? To what degree is it\npossible to defeat terrorism? - Well, first of all, part of the problem of our foreign policy has been how many conflicts, wars, military actions have\nbeen waged in the name of this, quote, unquote,\n\"war on terrorism,\" in the name of national security, legislation like the Patriot Act that violates civil liberties, our civil liberties and freedoms in the name of the war on terrorism and national security\nwhen it's not justified. And so I'll use Afghanistan as an example. I support the initial mission that lifted off shortly\nafter the attack on 9/11, the Islamist terrorist attack on 9/11. It was a relatively small\ngroup of U.S. military launched to go after those Al-Qaeda cells and Osama bin Laden in\nthe wake of that attack. That is the mission that\nshould have been supported and focused on in its execution. Instead, as you know, attention was diverted very quickly to the regime change war in Iraq that was waged on false pretenses. And the resources and focus was taken away from that initial mission\nthat went to Afghanistan. And the war in Afghanistan blew up into something that\nbecame about regime change and governance and the Taliban and less focus on Al-Qaeda\nand Osama bin Laden. And it became this thing that\neven general officers had a hard time articulating,\nwhat is the objective here? What are we trying to accomplish? What does winning look like? At what point do we know it's\ntime to exit and get out? And as you look at things\nlike the, you know, the Afghanistan files and others, the answers to these simple\nand essential questions shifted and changed over\ntime, over a very long time. Similarly, in Iraq, you know, I bought into a lot of what was being sold by the administration and by Democrats and Republicans and Congress at the time. And very quickly, even as\nI was on the ground there, started to have my eyes opened up into how we had been lied to tremendously, and how that protracted\nwar went on for a very, very long time with decisions being made that ultimately served to\nstrengthen terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda, the creation\nof ISIS and others, really undermining our national security interests in the meantime. Understanding the enemy that\nyou are trying to defeat is essential to being\nable to build a strategy. The declaration of President\nBiden, for example, saying, \"Well, the war on terror is over, the war on terror is over,\" what does that mean? Or the forever wars are over. Well, what does that actually mean? I served on my most\nrecent deployment in 2021 to East Africa and Somalia, where al-Shabaab is one of those Islamist terrorist groups that follows the same ideology as Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Hamas, and others. This group has been allowed\nto grow and be strengthened, even though they are\none of the main groups that provides funding to\nAl-Qaeda in that entire region. So any president or politician\ncan declare a war to be over. But when you have an enemy like these Islamist terrorist groups who are still intent on their\ngoal and their objective, which is to, ultimately, establish their Islamic\ncaliphate and, you know, destroy Israel and\nexterminate the Jewish people and basically, kill or convert anyone who\ndoesn't adhere to their ideology, that continues on and they\nwill only become stronger the longer our leaders put\ntheir heads in the sand and then pretend like, oh\nno, this doesn't exist. This kind of war, this war specifically is one that has to be waged militarily and ideologically. And the ideological component to this, which is defeating their\nideology with a superior one is one that I pointed out in Congress during the Obama administration, we, the collective we were failing at, the Obama administration was\nfailing at because they were so afraid of being labeled Islamophobes, that they refused to accurately identify the ideology driving\nthese terrorist groups and instead said, \"Oh, we are\ncountering violent extremism,\" was the term that the Obama administration started to use and was coined and kind of mandated\nacross the U.S. government. Well, you have to know, again, you have to know the\nenemy that threatens you and why they're doing what they're doing, if you have any hope of actually\npreventing their attack, both militarily, and as we're seeing now\nwith Hamas' actions, not only directly in\nthe assault on Israel, but how Hamas achieved their objectives in spreading their\nideology around the world. - If you look at the lessons learned from the U.S. involvement\nin Afghanistan and Iraq, how do you fight terrorism? - Clearly understanding who\nthey are and where they are and why they're doing what they're doing is essential, first of all. And obviously, there are\ndifferent groups, different names. They have morphed and changed based on their locale\nand how they operate. Building relationships with\npeople in other countries, both state leaders as\nwell as religious leaders and others who share that same objective of defeating these Islamist\nterrorists on both fronts and acting as a united\nfront in taking that action. What exactly that action looks like, details on the ground dictate that, details about these different\ngroups will dictate that. But we've seen examples of this before, and I saw this in Somalia. We saw it in some cases in\nIraq where, for example, you have Imams who recognize the threat that these terrorist groups pose to their own people and\ntheir own communities and exerting their influence in defeating the terrorist Islamist ideology with their own teachings of Islam and preaching peace amongst their people. War is ugly and it is messy. It is also an unfortunate\nreality of the world we live in. So while I firmly believe that\nwe must always pursue peace, I'm not a pacifist, I'm a realist, and recognize that where\nthere are these threats, we must do what we can to\nwork towards that safety, that security, that freedom\nand peace that we all want."

      "section": "War in Gaza",
      "text": "- If we look at the perspective of Israel in the Israel-Gaza War going on now, what do you do with the fact\nthat the death of a civilian serves as a catalyst, gives birth to hate, potentially generational hate? So in Israel's stated\ngoal of destroying Hamas, they are creating immeasurable hate. What do you do with that? From a perspective of Israel, what is the correct action to take in response to October 7th? - It's a complex question\nwith a complex answer. I think Israel's approach has to be in recognizing that delineation as far as possible. And I know it's tough when you have a terrorist group like Hamas that is so interwoven within the\ncommunity of people in Gaza. But to recognize that there should be and there is a shared purpose there for the Palestinian people to be able to live free and in peace and not under the oppression\nof this terrorist group, just as the people of Israel\nwould like to live in peace and free from the threat of\nattack from a terrorist group that wants to exterminate them. The complexities of what's\ngoing on in Israeli politics is, I think a different conversation, but also one that is directly intertwined with the answer to this question. When you have some people\nin the Israeli government who don't want the Palestinian\npeople in Gaza at all and want them to go and\nrepatriate in other countries, I think that's a big problem, and that further exacerbates this hatred and resentment that\ncontinues to grow there. This is a generation's long\nchallenge, unfortunately, of the resentment and tension that exists between many Israelis\nand many Palestinians that can only be resolved\nwhen there's strong leadership representing both peoples who are able and willing to come together and recognize that the only way forward is to let the past be in the past and find a way towards\npeace in the future. - How do you think, how do you hope the war\nin Ukraine will end? - The only way that this war ends is to do exactly what we're talking about. There has to be a brokered dialogue and conversation about\npeace that has to occur with representatives\nfrom Russia and Ukraine. It is really truly\nheartbreaking to see both how efforts that began just weeks after Russia invaded\nUkraine to do exactly this were thwarted by the\nBiden-Harris administration and other Western powers has cost so many innocent people's lives. And this is where I get... I have friends in Ukraine, I've been there more than a few times. I've enjoyed and appreciated\nthe time that I've spent there. When I hear from my friends about how afraid they are\nof their husbands being conscripted and, you know, feeling like they have to hide for fear of being yanked off the streets, their friends and family members who've been killed in this war, the only way this ends is when both sides come to the table and find an agreement that neither side is gonna\nbe completely happy with, both sides being forced\nto make some concessions,"

      "text": "but one where they will both walk away and this war can end. - What's the role of the\nU.S. President perhaps to bring everybody to the table? Do you think that the U.S.\nPresident should sit down with Zelenskyy, Putin together? - Yes, yes. In an ideal world, yes. This should have happened long ago. The question of whether\nor not President Biden is the right person to do that at this time, when all of the statements and\ncomments that they have made, the Biden-Harris administration has made from the beginning of this war essentially point to their objective being to basically, destroy Russia. And that's one of the reasons\nwhy they have supported both the continuation of this war\nfor as long as it's lasted, as well as why they have\nthwarted efforts towards peace. Whoever that most\neffective neutral broker is that that's the best person to do this. The Biden-Harris administration, I think the role that they have to take is actually encouraging Zelenskyy to sit down and begin this process. Those kinds of engagements\nare the most, to me, the most powerful exercises of diplomacy that can't be matched, especially when our\nPresident's foremost role and responsibility is to\nserve as Commander in Chief. And I wish that we had\nleaders who were more willing to engage because I think we'd make a lot more progress more quickly and to find areas both of mutual interest as well as to help deconflict\nand deescalate areas where there is tension or disagreement or adversarial interests. - Well, some of it is\nbasic human comradery. Like people call me naive for this, but sometimes just knowing that there's a human on the other side.\n- Yes. - Even like when it's in private, if you look at Zelenskyy\nand Putin, for example, just humor. Both are very intelligent, witty, at times, even funny people. Yes, this is wartime, yes, a lot of civilians\nand soldiers are dying. There's hate. But if you can look above it all and think about the\nfuture of the countries, the flourishing of a people and the stopping of the death\nof civilians and soldiers, then in that place you can have that basic human connection. - I agree. I don't think\nthat's naive at all. And I think there are so many examples through history that point\nto the power of that, the real power in that. In, you know, the Cuban Missile Crisis, how JFK had to literally find a secret way to communicate with Khrushchev to try to go around the backs of\nthe military commanders who were urging him to\ntake military action, and instead find, \"Hey, we both, ultimately, want the same thing. Neither of us wants to launch\na catastrophic nuclear war, so let's figure this out.\" - Of course, there's examples\nthroughout history, you know, leaders are complicated people,\nthey're manipulative people. So you have like Hitler\nand Chamberlain meeting and Chamberlain kinda-\n- Yeah. - getting hoodwinked by Hitler's charisma and being convinced that Hitler\ndoesn't have any interest in invading and destroying\nthe rest of the world. So, you know, you have to- - He's smart. (chuckles) Don't be hoodwinked. (chuckles)\n(Lex chuckling)"

      "text": "- You've met, you've\nbeen criticized for this, you've met with Syrian\nPresident Bashar Assad, and as part of the campaign when, you know, running for president, got criticized for not\ncalling him a war criminal. What's the right way to meet and communicate\nwith these kinds of leaders? - As I just stated, we need leaders who have\nthe courage to meet, not just with allies, but with adversaries in\nthe pursuit of peace, in the pursuit of increased understanding. If policies are being made through the lenses and the\nbarriers of bureaucrats and the media and others who have or may have their own interests, our President, a leader can't make, even members of Congress\ncan't make decisions with the kind of clarity that we, the American people need them to make. I think that these\nkinds of engagements are weaponized and politicized,\nas they were against me, by those who have their own interests, whether it be the military\nindustrial complex or in Washington. If you're not part of\nthe official narrative of the U.S. government, which was intent on a\nregime change war in Syria, then you're an outcast. And it was unfortunate because, you know, people levied all kinds of\naccusations and, you know, smears against me for going and having the audacity to go and learn more, try to seek the truth in the hopes of preventing\nmore needless war, and in the hopes of preventing\nyet another quagmire and disastrous war in the Middle East and simply foregoing and yes, meeting with Assad. Also meeting with\nreligious leaders in Syria, also meeting and talking with people on the streets of Damascus, talking with college students, talking with people from\nthe opposition party who would like to see Assad replaced, you know, talking with local law, just a whole host of people over the course of a few days, you know, the accusation was of you, like, \"Oh, she loves dictators.\" It's a sad state of affairs when some of the most\ninfluential voices in our country will label someone a lover\nor supporter of dictators, simply because you're saying, \"Hey, we shouldn't be going\nto war. There is another way.\" And I'm not alone in this. You know, people who were\nagainst the war in Iraq were given similar labels until it became, you know, popular in our politics to\nhave been against the Iraq war. We see the same thing now with people like Tucker, myself and\nothers, who are saying, \"We should not be waging this proxy war against Russia, via Ukraine, and using the Ukrainian\npeople's lives in this war.\" Well, now all of a sudden, you're a Putin lover or a\nPutin puppet or whatever, you know, the traitor, treason, all of these accusations\nthat are used, ultimately, by people who are not interested in having a substantive conversation\nabout the truth, about looking at these wars\nand conflicts, you know, with a comprehensive view on exactly all the\ndynamics that are at play. And that's what I found when I came back. When I went to Syria, looking forward to coming back and shedding light on different\nperspectives, experiences, and stories that I found that would give people a\nmore broad understanding of what was happening in that country, and what I found was\nthere was zero interest in the mainstream media or in Congress in hearing any other perspective other than their own, which was, \"We need to launch this regime change war through the use of arming and equipping known terrorists within Syria\nto overthrow the regime\" without them stating any realistic idea of who would take control\nonce Assad was overthrown. But the reality actually being that no matter which opposition group they might try to prop up, they would not have the power to withstand the terrorist\ngroups whose stated goal was to go and take over power from Assad. They had no interest in trying\nto gain true understanding. And it was very disheartening, it was very disheartening\nand a big lesson learned about where their interests\nreally were focused. - Yeah, it's a simplistic\nnarrative template that's fit into every single situation. A lot of stuff is not talked about in the Russia-Ukraine war. One of the things that's\nnot talked about is, Okay, so Putin is overthrown, then who do you think\nwill come into power? - [Tulsi] Exactly. - And one of the things I\ntalk about with our stoics is that Putin, and he gets\ncriticized for this, that Putin, out of all the\npeople that might take power, is the most liberal, is the most dovish. - [Tulsi] Mm. - In fact, every indication shows that\nhe really hates this war. - [Tulsi] Mm. - And so everybody that will step in, if he steps down or if he is overthrown, is just going to accelerate this war and the expansionism and\nthe thirst for empire and all that kinda stuff that the U.S. military industrial\ncomplex will feed into. So you have to think about\nwhat the future holds and what the different power players are and what the level of corruption there is and sort of the realistic\nview of the situation versus the idealistic\nview of the situation. - Just on that note real quick, I think that was exposed in broad daylight when it appeared that, you know, the former head of the Wagner group was about to try to launch a coup and how that was so\ncelebrated even on, you know, like MSNBC and Rachel Maddow and others touting that this was somehow\ngoing to be a great thing without looking at, you\nknow, who is this guy really, what has he been doing in different countries around the world and what would be his kind of ruling philosophy and how that would differ or\nbenefit American interests or the interest of security and peace. - But also the interest\nof Ukraine or Russia and humanity overall-\n- True, true. - just the flourishing of nations, which is great for everybody and collaborations with nations. - [Tulsi] I agree. - Friendly competition. You know, one of the things I love about the 20th century is the friendly, sometimes not so friendly competition between the Soviet Union\nand the United States in space, in the space race.\n- Mm. - That's created some\nincredible engineering and scientific breakthroughs\nand all of this, and also made people dream about like reaching out to the stars and war destroys all of that-\n- Yeah. - or damages it,\nhopefully just damages it. Hopefully, the phoenix will rise again."

      "text": "Well, let me ask you about\nthe criticism you've mentioned of this probably the most\ncommon criticism of you that you love Putin. So just to linger on it, what do you think is the\nfoundation of this criticism? - Well, I'll tell you when it began. You know, my first day in Congress\nwas January 3rd, 2013. I believe it was the third, fourth, fifth, somewhere around there. And my last day was January 3rd, 2021. Given my experience of serving as a soldier in the Middle East and the motivation that really drove me to run for Congress in the first place, I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee\nfor almost eight years, the eight years that I was there with my drive and motivation\nto actually be in a position to challenge the influence of the military industrial complex to try to prevent us from\nneedlessly going to war. And so, you know, the likes of Hillary Clinton and the cabal of warmongers in Washington, they weren't fans of\nmine, to say the least. I can't say it was a total surprise, but it was nonetheless that\nthe very day that I announced my candidacy that I was\nrunning for president, which was in February, 2019, the hour that I walked up onto that stage to announce my candidacy,\nit was in Hawaii, and I gave my announcement speech, NBC News published a hit piece that planted the seeds of\nsuspicion in voters' minds that somehow I was a darling of Putin and Russia and whatever. It was baseless, all of it baseless, and that continued like a steady drumbeat throughout my candidacy. But that really was escalated when, in a podcast with David Axelrod,\nHillary Clinton said, oh, \"Well, the Russians are grooming her,\" and this is not, I mean this came from a very influential person.\n- Yeah. - She was the former Secretary of State, former U.S. Senator, former First Lady, someone who wielded and\ncontinues to wield a lot of power in the Democratic\nParty and amongst voters. And that took it to a whole new level. What is the basis for this? Nothing. It is a tired, yet dependable playbook that is used not only by\npeople like Hillary Clinton, but also people like\nMitt Romney and others to try to smear, discredit, and destroy the reputations of people who have the audacity to question their objectives as they\ncall for one war or another, or have the audacity\nto say that this is not in the best interest of peace or in our country, in\nour national security. They keep going back to this playbook, as they do today, because again, they're not willing to\ndebate the substance of one position versus another, which is what we should have. If people feel so strongly\nthat we should be going and waging this war or\nthat war, okay, great. Go make your case to the American people. Go stand on the floor of\nthe United States House and actually have this debate. Allow those who are saying,\n\"No, this is not a good idea,\" to also stand freely\nand make that argument. Instead, they resort to the kind of name calling that tells voters, Hey, you can't trust this person\nor anything that they say. Myself and some of my other colleagues got the same treatment when we tried to pass legislation in Congress that would have taken out\nprovisions from the Patriot Act that are most egregiously violating our Fourth Amendment\nrights and civil liberties, authorities that have\nallowed our government to illegally surveil\nAmericans without a warrant. And as we did, so we're called traitors. We had other members of Congress\non the House floor saying that \"If you pass this legislation, you will be responsible for another 9/11 style\nattack on our soil.\" These are all distraction tactics to try to divert our attention away from what's actually happening. And instead, just tell voters, Hey, you can't trust these people. Obviously, this has happened to Trump, it's happened to Bobby Kennedy, it's happened to people\nlike Rand Paul and others. There's a small group,\nbut a growing number, at least I'm on the\nRepublican side at this point, people who are actually\nwilling to stand up and challenge the military\nindustrial complex, challenge the warmongers in both parties. - Well, people on the left have challenged the warmongers as well\nthroughout the last few decades, - Less so recently. I agree with you, but less so recently, and this is one of the reasons why I left the Democratic Party, one of the foremost reasons. I devote an entire chapter to this issue in my book \"For Love of Country: Leave the Democrat Party Behind,\" going into the detail of some of the things we've talked about, about my own experiences, about what I have learned along the way, but also how, you know, even in the last year or two years, certainly under this Administration, people who I worked with in\nCongress who were Democrats, dependable voices for civil liberties, dependable voices speaking\nout against the insanity of people who wanted to wage\nwar for the sake of war, they're largely silent now. And unfortunately, within the Democratic party in Washington, there is no room for debate that if you challenge the\nBiden administration's position on foreign policy, you're\ngonna hear about it. And what we have seen is that, that's exactly what's happened, and people have retracted\nstatements or just fallen silent. Or whatever the case may be, this debate that should be\nexistent within both parties on the Democrat side, unfortunately, it just doesn't exist anymore. - There seems to be some\nkind of mass hysteria over the war in Ukraine. It was strange to watch\nthat the nuance aspect of the discussion was lost very quickly. It was Putin, bad.\n- Right. - It was a war between good and evil. - [Tulsi] Right. - And in that, if you bring up any kinda\nnuance discussion of like, how do we actually achieve\npeace in the situation, you're immediately put\non the side of evil. - Yeah, which is pretty sick\nwhen you think about it. - I mean it's, you know,\nthe cynical view is, of course, it's the military\nindustrial complex machine, the war profiteers just driving\nthis kind of conversation. - [Tulsi] Yeah. - You know, I hope they\ndon't have that much power. I hope they just have\nincentives and they push people and they kinda use people's natural desire to divide the world into good and evil and fight for the side of good. You know, people just have a\nnatural proclivity for that. And that's a good thing that we wanna fight for the side of good, but then that gets captured-\n- It is, and manipulated. - [Lex] Yeah. - Yes. I admire your hopefulness. I am hopeful also because of the goodness in people and the naturally\ncompassionate nature of people. However, I will tell you\nfrom firsthand experience that what we talk about is\nthe national security state and the military industrial complex, this cabal of warmongers that extends not only within government, but outside of government, extends to many powerful media outlets, they are incredibly powerful\nand don't have any qualms at destroying those who try to get in the way of their power and they've got a lot of tools. They've got a lot of tools to do that, which I think is why\nPresident Eisenhower chose to include this in his\nfarewell address as a warning. Because the only recourse, the only real power that has\nthe ability to destroy them and stand up against them is a free people living in a free society exercising the rights\nthat we have enshrined in the Constitution and Bill of Rights."

      "section": "Nuclear war",
      "text": "- I just talked to Annie Jacobsen. She wrote a book on nuclear war, a scenario of how a\nnuclear war will happen, second by second, minute by minute. I apologize, if it happens,\nhow it would happen. It's terrifying. - [Tulsi] Yeah. - It's terrifying how easy it is to start that one person can\nstart it, first of all. And then there's no way to stop it, even potentially with\ntactical nuclear weapons that the machinery of it, how clueless everybody is combined with the machinery of it, it's just impossible to stop. and it's just between the Russian that, the United States especially, and then all of a sudden\nyou have nuclear winter and 5 billion people are dead. - [Tulsi] Yeah. - And they die through just\nessentially torture, slowly. How do we avoid that? How\ndo we avoid a nuclear war? That's something that you\ntalk about and think about. How do we avoid this kind\nof escalation of a hot war? - I think the most essential\nthing, first of all, is understanding exactly\nwhat you have just detailed. We are in this very\nstrange and absurd time where we have talking heads,\nand so-called pundits on TV. We have politicians, we have people who are\ntalking about a nuclear war as though it is a war\nthat can be won, period, and a war that can be waged somehow without that risk of escalation to the point of destruction\nof human civilization. And so they talk about this as\nthough it's just another war. And especially as they talk about the use of tactical nuclear weapons and \"Oh, well, this is small and we think it'll send a message,\" without actually escalating to the point where we're dealing with\nthe kind of destruction that we witnessed in World War II. That's a dangerous thing when it becomes like normalized as, you know, \"Well, we've got this\nnew missile that'll go and it's targeted and it's strategic and it'll only harm this, quote, unquote, \"military target.\" Ronald Reagan was 100% correct\nwhen he said, you know, \"A nuclear war cannot be won\nand should never be waged.\" It was true then, and it's true now, no matter how much these guys who are producing these weapons or those who are benefiting\nfrom that industry try to tell us, \"Oh,\nno, it'll never happen.\" So to me, that's an important first step, to continue to inform and educate and sound the alarms to people. Don't buy this crap because it's not true. And I look forward to\nlistening to your podcast, but the PSA that was put out by New York City's\nEmergency Management Office about what to do in the\nevent of a nuclear attack, you would find it funny if it\nwasn't so deeply disturbing. How they created this\npublic service announcement, they distributed it everywhere across the city, on the internet. I think it was on the radio where you had a woman who\nappeared to be an actor coming in and saying, \"Hey, in the event of when the big one hits, here's what you should do. Focus on doing these three things.\" And I'm paraphrasing, but I\nencourage you to watch it. I'm paraphrasing, but she said, Get inside, stay inside and stay tuned. That was it. And you know, get inside,\ngo away from the windows. Stay inside, don't go outside\nuntil you get the all clear, and stay tuned. Follow our account on Instagram and Twitter.\n- Right. - And at the very end of this short PSA, her closing words were, \"We've got this.\" And it was so disturbing in that it was so completely outta touch with reality. It creates this kind of\nfalse sense of security that, okay, well, it's kinda like, here's what you do when a tornado hits or when a big storm hits, and categorizing the big one, a nuclear attack within that\nsame kind of preparedness that you would want people to have in the event of a\nnatural disaster of some sort. And it is reflective of the carelessness with which people in our government, that careless attitude that\npeople in our government have towards nuclear war and a nuclear attack, even as they set us up for failure in pushing us closer and closer to the brink of a nuclear war occurring, whether it be an intentional attack or as we saw during the last Cold War, one that could be\nlaunched unintentionally. You know, how many near misses were there during the last Cold War? I saw this documentary called\n\"The Man Who Saved the World,\" and it was some like mid-level officer who happened to be on duty and who didn't do what he was told in launching the nuclear missiles because of what they thought\nwas an incoming attack. And it turned out to be a complete mistake or misread on the radar, but\nthat's what we're facing. - By the way, there's so\nmany things to say there, but one of the things that\nan Annie Jacobsen details is just how organized the\nmachinery of all of this is where the humans involved\ndon't have to think. They just follow orders.\n- Mm. - There's a very clear\nset of steps you take and that there's very few places where you can inject your\nhumanity and be like, wait a minute, what's\nthe big picture of this? The only person that can think is the\npresident of the United States. - [Tulsi] Mm. - The president of the United States gets six minutes after the warning. The early warning system says,\nwhether it's false or not, says that we believe that there's been a nuclear weapon launched. You have six minutes before\nyou can make the decision of launch back, initiate. And to me, that's what\nI'm voting based on. (chuckles)\n- Right. - In the current situation, you really have to see that as one of the most important aspects- - [Tulsi] I agree. - of the United States President is who do you trust in those\nsix minutes to sit there? And I'm not really sure,\nlooking at Biden and Trump. Boy, I don't know, but I do know that I would like somebody who's thinking independently and not part of the\nmachinery of warmongers. That's really, I mean, I don't wanna make it\nsound cynical or dramatic, but sometimes in such scary situations and such dramatic situations, you kinda follow the momentum. - [Tulsi] Yes. - When the right thing to do, the right thing for a\nleader to do is to step back and look of all of human history- - [Tulsi] Yeah. - and ignore all the people\nin the room that are like saying stuff because most\nlikely what they're going to be saying is warmongery type of things. - [Tulsi] Yes. - That's one of the things\nwhy I also get criticized for, I still think Zelenskyy is\na hero for staying in Kiev. Everybody was telling him to flee. It was all the information\nwas basically saying the world's second\nbiggest military is like coming at Kiev. It's just dumb on all\nfronts to stay in Kiev, but that's what a great leader does, is ignores everybody and stays. - [Tulsi] Yeah. - Screw it. I'm gonna die for my country.\nI'm gonna die as a leader. And that's the right\nthing for leaders to do. - It's sad that, I mean, to me, that's what we should expect of our leaders-\n- Yes. - is exactly that. And it's sad that having a leader in that position fulfill\ntheir responsibility and the oath that they take\nis seen as a heroic act when we should, like, that's your job. That's what we elect our leaders to do. And yet so many, so many have failed. But to your point, it's not cynical at all to to know that in those rooms, especially\nin these moments of crisis, unfortunately, there are the predominant and prevailing opinion of this warmongering establishment that's not specific to one party is the knee-jerk reaction, which is to go to war or\nto execute an act of war. And this is, you know, one of the biggest of this establishment destroying the reputations of, and smearing and trying to cancel and censor those who are voices of peace or just those who take\na contrarian position and say, \"Well, hey, why don't we just pause for a moment and actually think this through? Why don't we talk through what happens if we take this course of action? What happens if we go\ndown a different path? Let's actually be thoughtful about what our options\nare for A, B, and C, and then make the decision in a thoughtful manner based on that.\" Even advocating for that\nis seen as a kind of heresy in the warmongering\nestablishment in Washington. The cost of their retaliation against those who are reasonable voices, who look at the world as it is not some fantasy that they wish existed, is in those rooms. During those critical\nmoments, people will, even if they know in\ntheir heart or their mind that this could end really badly, their instinct is to\nself-censor and not speak up because they don't want to\nexperience the wrath and ire, whether it be coming from four\nstar generals or, you know, the secretaries of state or defense or these high ranking people in positions of power and influence. They don't wanna be the one guy\nin the room who's just like, Hey guys, let's just take a breath and actually think this\nthrough, what will happen, not just in the immediate response of this action that you're advocating for, but what are all of the\nother people, other actors, stakeholders in the world,\nhow will they respond? And then how will we respond to them? How will they respond to us? Actually go through this\nexercise of, in the military, this is commonly referred to as, you know, \"What are the second, third,\nfourth order of effects that will occur as a result of pursuing a specific course of action?\" - It's weird how difficult it is to be that person in the room. - It requires courage. - Yeah, but like-\n- Which is sad, but it requires courage. - But why does it require, like even just to ask, okay, we've been in Afghanistan and Iraq for this number of years,\nwhat's the exit plan? - [Tulsi] Right. - Just bring that up like\nevery day in a meeting. - Yeah. (chuckles) - Like what's the exit plan? It's strange that that gets criticized, well, war in Iraq and so on. But I just remember,\nthere was this pressure. You can't quite criticize or like, ask dumb questions about, Wait, what? Why are we going into Iraq again? Like-\n- But they're not dumb questions. (chuckles)\n- Right. In retrospect, you're like, \"Oh, they're not dumb questions at all,\" but actually-\n- Yeah, yeah. - required a lot of courage- - [Tulsi] Yeah. - to ask them while still\nworking within the institution. It's easier if you're like an activist from the outside saying-\n- Sure. - \"No war,\" this kind of stuff.\n- Sure. - But within the institution in the position of power\nto ask the questions, like, maybe let's not? - [Tulsi] Yeah. (chuckles) - It seems really difficult.\n- Yeah. - And the same kind of\nthing in the war in Ukraine and just any kind of military involvement. Again, I guess the\ncynical interpretation is that it's the military industrial complex that permeates-\n- Yes. - just the halls of power. - It does. And what is behind the\nmilitary industrial complex? And there are different examples of this. You can look at the\npharmaceutical industry as well. There's a huge amount of money\nand a huge amount of power that wields tremendous influence\nover members of Congress. You know, there are\ndifferent examples of this, you know, across different\nsectors of our society, but I think the military\nindustrial complex, over time, has proven itself to be the most powerful and influential. And that's what is behind it is, is this is why they try to\ndestroy anyone who dares to ask the most obvious questions is because it is about\npower and wielding power. - Well, the good thing about\nUnited States president is they have the power to say F\nyou to everybody in the room, I think.\n- They do. - It just seems like they\ndon't quite take that power. Like you really, people say like, \"Yeah, the U.S. President doesn't\nhave that much power,\" I don't know about that. Just like if you look at the\nlaw, especially in military, when you're talking about war and the military, they\nhave a lot of power. - Yes. - So they can fire everybody, like-\n- Yes. - they have a lot of power. They can stop wars, they can start wars. They have a lot of power. - The position of the\npresidency certainly does. Unfortunately, we have people too often\nwho assume the presidency from a position of weakness because they're afraid of losing power. - [Lex] Sure. - And so they make those\ncalculated decisions not based on what is right or for the right reasons, but instead, driven by fear of loss of\npower and loss of influence. And that's where, especially given all that we are facing, we need leaders in the\npresidency and in Congress who have courage to be\nthat voice in the room to remain mindful of and\nrooted in the Constitution to,"

      "section": "TikTok ban",
      "text": "even as we are seeing this legislation being billed as the anti-TikTok bill, that's really not about TikTok, it's about freedom of speech. - Can you actually explain that bill? - Yes. This is another, I guess the bottom line, up front, is this is another piece of legislation being expedited through Congress with strong bipartisan support in the name of national security interests that is essentially a power grab and an assault on freedom and liberty. And I'll just say this in, I think probably like the top three things that they're not actually\ntelling us that's in the bill. Freedom of speech. It's our ability to be\nable to express ourselves, whether it be in person, on a podcast, on a social media platform, in a newspaper, whatever\nthe platform may be. This legislation gives\nthe executive the power to decide which platforms are acceptable, for us to be able to use TikTok itself. The words TikTok is not\nin actually in the bill, but it gives the power to\nthe president to decide who is a foreign\nadversary, single handedly, no consultation with or agreement from members of Congress or anyone else. It actually gives the power\nto a cabinet secretary to designate who is a foreign adversary. And if a social media\nplatform has at least 20% ownership in a social media platform, that platform may be banned from doing business in\nAmerica, essentially. But it's not just a foreign state actor that could be named as\na foreign adversary. It also includes a line in\nthe legislation that if... Let's say a person has at\nleast 25% financial interest or ownership in a social media platform. They're an American citizen who may be working or\nliving in some other country or working or living here, but doing business with other countries. If the executive branch\nof our government decides that this individual is\nunder the influence of, or controlled by someone that\nthey deem a foreign adversary, then that platform must not do business in America. And that person, obviously,\nand even an American citizen, is banned from conducting that business. They must divest, essentially. So when you look at, and this is where there's been\na lot of chat around this, when you look at Elon Musk, for example, well, you already have people\nin the Biden administration, even President Biden himself, implying that Elon Musk's activities need to be investigated. Well, he is someone with\nTesla who does business in a lot of countries, including China, and therefore, he must be investigated. It is not at all a stretch of imagination to say that X could be the next platform that the executive branch decides, Nope, we've designated this person\nto be a foreign adversary, and therefore, his business interest for this social media platform cannot be allowed to exist. We've seen this already with\npeople accusing him and X of interfering in our elections. Again, it it's ironic that it's coming from the Democratic party that they are claiming that\na guy who has said himself, he's committed to free speech and is allowing free\nspeech on his platform and is not allowing the federal government to manipulate his platform by deeming which accounts\nare okay to, you know, post their content and\nwhich accounts are not because of disinformation or\nwhatever they claim it to be. It's not an accident that\nthe social media platforms that have been proven to\ntake action at the behest of the federal government\nand the White House to censor certain voices, they're not included with\nor being targeted at all in this legislation or outside of it. Yet other platforms\nthat are not cooperating or collaborating somehow are. So the underlying issue here, this is being sold as TikTok\nand National Security, but ultimately, even as Ron Paul said, \"This is legislation\nthat's the greatest assault on liberty since the\nPatriot Act was passed. - Yeah. It's quite dark that\nthis is just a grab of power. - [Tulsi] It is. - I mean it's not just with\nElon, it's probably with Zuck, with Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp. It puts pressure, it's\nnot just about banning, but it puts pressure for them\nto kinda moderate behavior- - [Tulsi] Yes. - which is a slippery slope. Of course, it's a beautiful dance of power because you don't want tech companies to have too much power either, or individuals at the top of those tech companies\nto have too much power, but then, do you want that power\nin the hands of government? - [Tulsi] No. - The history of this nation\nis a fascinatingly effective journey towards the balance of power and it does seem like\nthis sneaky little thing, as much as I hate TikTok on all fronts. My brain rots every time I use TikTok.\n(Tulsi chuckling) I know it is also, like, the national security\ndangers of China and so on. But it's just like, TikTok, man, just, I just, I dunno, it's so addicting, it's so addicting. So when I first saw this TikTok bill, I was like, \"Yes,\" no pun,\n(Tulsi chuckling) but then they got me,\nthe Trojan horse got me. No-\n- They all, I mean, they all, and you know, and this is like \"The\nSocial Dilemma\" documentary I think exposed a lot that there's so much that these algorithms do in these various social media platforms that's problematic to say the least. Data security and privacy\nis a serious issue. These are serious things. And so let's have a conversation\nabout these serious things and cease these attempts to have our government try to tell us what we are and aren't\nallowed to see, you know, where we are and aren't allowed\nto say, what we wanna say. That's really what it comes down to. - Yeah, more and more trust people to, whenever social media\ncompanies do bullshitty things for the people to make\ndocumentaries about it, to discover-\n- Right. - for great journalists\nto do great journalism- - [Tulsi] Right. - and find the flaws and\nthe hypocrisy in the, like a call for transparency, all those kinds of things that\ndon't trust, in most cases, government regulation\nof technology companies because they seem to\nbe really out of touch that one-\n- Yeah. - they want power. - [Tulsi] Yeah. - They're really intimidated by the power that the tech companies have. And two, they don't seem to\nget at the technology at all. So they're like hindering innovation and they're just greedy for power-\n- Yeah. - and those are not the- - It's a bad combination. - [Lex] It's a bad combination. - The thing here too\nthough is this extends far beyond social media companies. You know, this is a very specific example, but it's one example of many how those who are greedy for power are continuing to try to find ways to tell us how to live our lives. They are increasingly trying to tell us, again, what we're allowed to see and hear, whether it be social media companies or what shows up in a Google\nSearch engine, for example. And if they're not finding a willing and compliant social media\ncompany or big tech company, then they are looking for\nways to reach their hand into those tech companies\nand force compliance. But, you know, in the\nage of disinformation, misinformation, hate speech, all of the excuses that\nare given for government, either directly or\nindirectly through big tech to try to censor certain voices, it really undermines the truth, which is the way to defeat bad speech is with better speech and more speech, whether it's hate speech, or things that you might be offended by, or things that you might disagree with. The answer is not to have some entity with\nthe power of censorship and being the, quote, unquote, \"authority\" to decide what is good\nspeech and acceptable and what is bad speech and unacceptable. It's what you said, let's\nencourage this debate and, you know, encourage people\nwho are inspired by like, \"No man, I saw this thing,\" or \"this thing is happening\nand it's pissing me off,\" so I'm gonna bring a superior argument. I'm gonna show what the right way is. And gosh, what this is what\nour founders envisioned for us as a society in this country. And we would be so much stronger\nwith a more engaged people and a more informed people if we had this and had it supported. - What are the chances that\nthe TikTok Ban Bill passes? - The way that it passed through the House of Representatives with such an overwhelming\nbipartisan support and so quickly, and President Biden saying that if it comes across\nas desk, he'll sign it, I thought it would pass\nthrough very quickly. I'm only slightly encouraged by the fact that the Senate at least\nappears to be saying, Hey, there are serious free speech\nconcerns around this bill, serious civil liberties\nconcerns around this bill. We need to do our due diligence. I won't say I'm cautiously optimistic because I understand how that place works, but their pause at least\ngives people the opportunity to continue to kind of sound the alarm and for people to call their senators and express their concerns with this that are very real, valid concerns. - Yeah, this is really messed up. Just in case we didn't make it clear, I think this is really, really big danger if this thing passes. Even if you hate Elon\nMusk or you're whatever, this is really, really, really dangerous. If the government gets\nsay over the platforms on which we communicate with\neach other is a huge problem. - And there's a section in there as well, just kind of the last piece on this, is if you use a VPN and you try to use a VPN to access this, you could have problems with the law. And you take that a step further and say, well, how would they know? There's a surveillance aspect to that. So once you start peeling back the layers of this really toxic\nonion, (chuckles) it leads, it really leads seriously to a pretty dark and dangerous and oppressive place. - You were a long-time Democrat. You were the vice chair of the\nDemocratic National Committee"

I loved him before he was cool, all right?\n(Tulsi chuckling) Anyway, can you go through what\nhappened in that situation- - Yeah. - and with the Democratic\nNational Committee and with Bernie and why you resigned? - As a vice chair of the\nDemocratic National Committee, one of the rules of the DNC required was that officers of the DNC of which we were as I\nthink there were five or six of us who were\nvice chairs at the time, you have to remain neutral\nin a Democratic primary. So you're not, as a party, supposed to be tipping the\nscales in any direction for any candidate during\na primary election. And so I had no plans to get involved for any candidate or against any candidate\nduring that primary and just the hopes of like, all right, we gotta make sure that this\nis a fair and balanced primary so that voters have the\nbest opportunity to vote for the candidate of their choosing. I saw a couple of things pretty quickly. Number one is that the\nchair of the DNC at the time was a woman named Debbie\nWasserman Schultz, a congresswoman out of Florida. And she made very serious\ndecisions unilaterally that many times we found out about via tweet or press release that showed she was tilting\nthe scales in the favor of Hillary Clinton in that 2016 primary. The other thing that I saw\nwas how the mainstream media and those who are supposed\nto be in a position to be neutral arbiters, to facilitate debates and\nforums and conversations so that voters can be best informed in who they wanna vote for, were calling Hillary Clinton\nthe most qualified person ever to run for president in\nthe history of our country because of the positions that she had held as Secretary of State, as a\nU.S. Senator, as First Lady. And yet they glossed over those titles without ever holding her,\nasking questions even, or holding her to account for her record, especially in the area of foreign policy. The job she was running for\nwas to be Commander in Chief, to be the president of the United States. That responsibility to\nserve as Commander in Chief is the foremost responsibility\na president has. It's essentially the one\narea where the president can unilaterally make decisions without... Education, healthcare, immigration, Congress has to actually pass legislation. President can come through and say, Hey, here's the policies I want. Here's legislation that I'll propose, but that those changes can't\nbe made without Congress, working with Congress to pass them. So she was essentially being let off the hook for her record. As an American, as a\nsoldier, as a veteran, that was a big problem for me. And so I made the decision to resign as vice chair of the DNC so that I could endorse Bernie Sanders, who largely at heart, I believe\nis a non-interventionist. He hasn't focused a lot on foreign policy. It's not at the heart of what his focus has been for decades, but he was certainly far more of a non-interventionist\nthan Hillary Clinton, who has shown through her record to be the queen of\nwarmongers in Washington. I wanted to be in a position\nwhere I would have a platform to inform voters about her record so that they could make\nthat decision for themselves so that they could see, hey,\nin this area on this issue, which is incredibly important, there is a clear contrast\nbetween these two candidates running in the Democratic primary. And that's what drove\nmy decision to resign and to endorse Bernie Sanders. And that's what I went on to do throughout the rest of\nthat primary election. - What do you like most\nabout Bernie, the positive? - You know, what I like most about him is, is he is who he is, unapologetically so-\n- Yeah. - both in personality, but\nalso in what he advocates for, and what he's advocated\nfor for a long time. So, you know, you can agree or\ndisagree with his positions, but he is who he is."

      "text": "- Like I said, you were\na long-time Democrat, you ran for president\nin 2020 as a Democrat. Now you're an independent and you wrote an excellent\nbook describing your journey ideologically,\nphilosophically through that. Why did you choose to\nleave the Democratic Party? - In the book, I go into a number of the central reasons\nwhy I made that choice, but fundamental to them is that the Democratic\nparty has become a party that is opposed to freedom, that is opposed to the central\nand foundational principles that exist within our founding documents and that serve as the identity\nof who we are as Americans and what this country\nis supposed to be about. It has become a party that is controlled by this elitist\ncabal of warmongers who are driving forward this,\nquote, unquote, \"woke agenda.\" And we see it through their\nracializing of everything. We see this through their\ndefund the police mission. We see this through their\nopen border policies. We see this through how in their education policy\nthey're failing our kids and how they are pushing this narrative that ultimately, is a\nrejection of objective truth. The fact that it's a\nquestion up for debate about whether or not, well, actually it's not a\nquestion up for debate for them. They are actively pushing for, you know, boys who identify as girls to compete against girls in sports, changing our language\nso that the word woman, the identity of being a woman is essentially being\nerased from our society. And it is the height of\nhypocrisy and, frankly, an act of hatred towards women that they are so intent on doing this, and ironic that it's coming\nfrom the party that for so long proclaim themselves to\nbe the greatest feminist and the most pro-woman\nparty in the country. I go into detail around each\nof these issues and more in the book, but you will see as we go\nthrough each of these issues, fundamental and foundational to every one of them is that, sadly, the Democratic party has become a party that is so consumed by\ntheir desire for power, this insatiable hunger for power, that they are willing to destroy our Republic, our democracy, our freedom, just so that they can try to hold onto to power and gain more power. - So these are just different\nmechanisms for power. The identity politics-\n- Yes. - and the warmongering\nare related to each other in that they're mechanisms\nto attain more power. - [Tulsi] Yes. - You know, you're making it sound like only the Democratic party are full of power-hungry people. So to you... You know, the Republican party, I don't know if you've met those folks, but some of them-\n- Couple of them. (chuckles) - are also in love with power and are, you know-\n- Yes. - at times, to some degree, politicians in general are corrupt, sometimes within the legal bound, sometimes slightly outside\nof the legal bounds. And so to you, to what degree is sort of\nthe Democratic party worse than the Republican party? So I don't wanna paint a\npicture of like this kinda beautiful vision of the Republican party, that they're somehow-\n- No, that doesn't exit. - not power hungry. - Yeah. I'm glad you brought this up. You know, the book, the book details why after 20 or so years as a member of the Democratic\nParty, I decided to leave, and it goes through my experiences and things that I have seen\nand learned along the way, but I also point out exactly\nthat fact in the book. But from the very beginning\nwith the prologue is, \"We should not be naive to think that this only exists within\nthe Democratic party.\" There are very serious problems within both of our political parties, specifically coming from politicians who are driven by this desire for power and who are so afraid\nof losing that power, that they're willing to do whatever they feel they need to do, which centers around\ntaking away our freedom because the more free we are\nto make our own decisions, even if they may end up\nbeing the wrong decisions, but to learn from those things and know that we've gotta\nlive with the consequences, the beauty and messiness of\nwhat a free society looks like. They're so afraid of us because they see us as the people and our freedom as the central threat to their ability to remain in power. I think the difference\nthat we're seeing today is that, unfortunately, we\ntalked about this a little bit, how the Democratic\nparty has become a party where you must walk in lockstep with the leadership of that party or risk being faced with, you know, your reputation being\ndestroyed and smeared and all of these different attacks. And the reason why they do that is to put people like me and Bobby Kennedy and others up as an\nexample of saying, \"Hey, if you step outta line,\nif you challenge us, this is what we're gonna do to you.\" The Republican party has also done that, and they also have politicians and leaders\nwho are more interested in feeding, you know, the thriving system in the\nWashington establishment. But we are also seeing that the Republican party\nalso has some voices, and I would say increasing\nvoices of people and I would put Donald\nTrump in this category who are challenging the, quote, unquote, \"norms\nof the Republican party\" that are represented by people like Nikki Haley or\nMike Pence, for example. You know, the Republican party\nis not a monolithic entity and you know, it means different\nthings to different people. And that's where I\nthink the real challenge in this next election is it's really less about one\npolitical party over another and it's more about our opportunity as voters to select leaders, first of all, to fire those\nwho are against freedom and who are warmongers\nwho by their essence are willing to take away our freedom in the name of national security, and vote for people, nobody's perfect, we shouldn't hold\nanybody up on a pedestal, but vote for those who are\ncommitted to the Constitution and who hold those values that represent the\ninterests of the people. - (sighs) I'm not a fan of this choice, but here we are, Biden versus Trump. So let me ask you sort of a challenging question\nof pros and cons. Can you gimme pros and cons of each. What's the biggest strength\nand biggest limitation of, let's say Biden? - This is a tough question. I've known President\nBiden for a lot of years. I knew his son Beau, who served in the National\nGuard the same time that I did. I consider Joe Biden a friend. He is someone over the years that I've talked to and shared laughs with and spent time with in\ndifferent situations. The positive characteristics that drew me to Joe Biden of the past, they are not represented in\nhow he has led as President. And, you know, I'll let the pundits theorize as to how that is or why that is. But the truth that I know exists, which points to his weakness is that instead of listening\nto his better angels, he has instead at every turn, if you go back and you, you know, I look back to his inauguration speech where he promised to be a\npresident for all Americans. And, you know, during his campaign promise\nto be the uniter in chief, to bring a country together\nthat was deeply divided, that's the Joe Biden that\nI've known for many years, a guy who has, you know, worked with different people with different backgrounds\nand different political views, but tried to find at\ndifferent points in time a way to work together. At every turn, he has done the exact opposite of what he spoke about during\nhis inauguration speech, and has left us as the American\npeople today more divided, less secure, both from\nan economic standpoint, as well as a national security or a safety and security standpoint, and less free as a\nsociety and as a people. - So the biggest criticism\nwould be he divided us or continued the division\nthat's been there. Who do you be the greatest uniter? Like to me, over the past\nfew decades, to me, Obama. You've been very critical of Obama on the foreign policy side on many fronts, but to me, that guy did really good. Maybe some people say just rhetoric, but I think rhetoric matters\nwhen you're president. I think he was, out of all the presidents we had was probably the most\neffective uniter of the people. Would that be fair to say? - During his 2008 campaign, yes. I think that his message resonated with so many people across generations and across, you know, different views, different backgrounds to where, you know, people cried on the\nnight that he was elected because they felt so hopeful. I talked to people and I know people who set aside their entire\nlives to work on his campaign to be a part of this\nhope and change mission that he laid out that\nwould bring us together. You know, some of the people\nthat I know personally, they gave up their lives\nduring the campaign and after he won they\nwent to Washington, D.C. because they wanted to be able to do the work that he had laid out and continued to be a part of this mission that they expected would\nextend beyond the campaign. And they've expressed to me personally how heartbroken they were because so quickly after he was elected, instead of bringing in a new\ngeneration of fresh leadership that was not a part of the\nWashington establishment, he instead immediately chose\nto surround himself with people who were more of the same old, same old, who were essentially part of the problem. And many of his actions after that proved that fear and\nthat brokenheartedness that they felt to be true. And I'll mention one example related to civil liberties that we talked about. He was someone as a U.S. senator who gave some pretty powerful\nspeeches on the Senate floor about his concerns with the Patriot Act, his concerns with surveillance from NSA, his concerns with a violation of our Fourth Amendment\nrights and civil liberties. But when as president, he was confronted with leaked information about this surveillance occurring under those authorities in his presidency, he took this side of the\nnational security state and did not take action\nto right the wrongs that he correctly pointed out as senator and during his campaign\nfor the presidency, which is unfortunate\nbecause he really did build this unifying momentum\nthroughout his campaign. - What do you think that is? Why is it so hard as a\npresident to kinda act on the promises of the\ncampaign, but also just, I mean, his speech is\nbasically anti-war speech that really resonated to me, the fact that he was against the war in Iraq, I believe early-\n- Yes, yes. - early on. - And that was a huge point of distinction between him and Hillary Clinton, probably one of the biggest. - Why is it so hard when you step into the Office of President\nto sort of act on your ideals? - I think it goes back to what we talked about a little bit, which is, you know, what are you driven by and\nwhat are you afraid of, and if you are concerned for whether or not you can get reelected, who's going to fund\nthat reelection effort, who's going to fund the\npresidential library and your legacy that will follow? There have been some documented examples around how he promised to\ncrack down on big pharma, but when push came to shove, his Department of Justice\ncampaign funding was threatened and they chose not to take action even when they had a very,\nvery strong case to make. This was with regard to the\nopioid crisis in the country. And you know, this just goes back to the heart of why it's so essential\nthat we have leaders who have courage and who are focused on doing what we elect them to do. - And who are resistant to\nthe love of money and power. - [Tulsi] Yes. - It's hard. - And we are human, we are fallible, we are flawed by nature. And I'll go into kind of the\nnext one you asked about Trump, the weakness side and the lessons that I\nhope have been learned from 2016 for him and his team is you have to be in a position where you are surrounding yourselves with other people of courage who aren't just thinking\nabout their next political job or their next job, getting a cable news contract\nor looking for fame themselves or looking at how they can\nmonetize their position for whatever their next\nfinancial interest might be. But people of courage who\nknow what they're up against to really seriously clean house across the federal government\nand the corruption and rot that is so deeply entrenched\nin order to truly be effective. And if he is reelected, that is my hope that he's learned from\nwhat went wrong in 2016, that, you know, he went in, you know, with a largely non-interventionist, more focused on peace agenda, and yet he surrounded himself with people who are at the heart of the\nwarmongers in Washington, and who directly went against the policies that he advocated for. On the strength side, I think it's easy to point out because it's also what has caused him to be so attacked in ways\nthat we haven't seen before, certainly not in my lifetime by the Democrats, by the\nBiden administration. Not only in now, but you know, something that started back in\n2016 when he was a candidate. He's a guy who, you know, by all measures has been\nsuccessful in his own life. And because of that, he's not coming in with this\ndesire to please Washington, that many other politicians have. And because he is so willing to challenge the, quote, unquote, \"norms,\" and these are not norms\nthat serve the interests of the American people, these are norms that serve the interests of the most powerful,\nhe is a direct threat. And so that attitude and that mindset of not coming in with the kind of caution that too many politicians come in with, of wanting to be the\npopular one at the parties or whatever it is that they want, that that is the strength that he brings. - Yeah, I just had a\nconversation with Dana White and he's good friends with Trump, and he talks to the fact that he seems to be resistant to the attacks. Something aspect of that\nis it's just the psychology of being able to withstand their attacks that are there in the political game and that can break people. Like you just don't want the headaches. So to withstand the attacks is tough. And something about his\npsychology allows for that. I mean, I guess a question for you also,"

Like how do you not become cynical or overcompensate the other\ndirection, that kind of stuff? - It really stems from having\na clear sense of purpose. I never saw... You know, I've served in state government, I've served on our city\ncouncil in Honolulu and served in Congress, but at no time have I seen this as a, quote, unquote, \"political career.\" I don't have that ladder-climbing ambition that a lot of politicians have. My sense of purpose is deeply\nrooted in my dedication and my desire in my life\nto be pleasing to God and to live a life of service. And what better way to be\npleasing to God than to try to do my best to work for the\nwell-being of God's children. Being rooted in that has made it so that as the attacks are\ncoming from different directions, even as people who I was friends with, former colleagues of mine,\nothers, even family members, even as they have turned away or become attackers against me themselves because of different\nreasons related to politics, of course, it's a sad thing, especially when it's someone\nthat you know, you know, personally and have had\na personal friendship, a relationship with. But I don't live my life\ntrying to please politicians or please the people who\nshow up on TV or anyone else.

      "text": "of religious faith in your\nlife, of your Hindu faith, and seeing the Bhagavad\nGita as a spiritual guide. So what role does faith\nin God play in your life? - It's everything. It is central to who I am, what inspires me, what motivates me, where I find strength, where I find peace, where I find shelter and\nwhere I find happiness. And this has been a constant throughout, you know, times of challenge, times of darkness, times of heartbreak, times of happiness in always feeling very secure in knowing that God's\nunconditional love is ever present. And no matter what else\nis happening in my life, that God is my best friend and remaining centered and grounded in always remembering that\nand meditating upon that truth is, it's everything to me. - The interesting thing about\nthe Hindu God is how welcoming the religion is of other religions, just- - [Tulsi] It's true. - how accepting it is. So in that way, in many ways, it's one of the most\nbeautiful religions on earth. So like who do you think God is to you? Like in the specifically the texts,\nbut also you personally, what does he represent? So for Hinduism, it's\nalso God can be many. There's also like a aspect where it's like a part of all of us? There's like a uniting thing, not a singular figure outside of us? - I think one of the things that's most commonly\nmisunderstood about Hinduism that people don't know is that, that Hinduism is truly\na monotheistic religion. That there is one God, and he goes by many names that describe his different\nqualities and characteristics. And as you pointed out,\nHinduism is uniquely of a non-sectarian spiritual\npractice, essentially. It's not a, quote, unquote, \"religion\" that you convert into or you leave behind or whatever the case may be. Bhagavad Gita, a central scripture in\ntext that comes from India, literally means \"Song of God.\" And the principles that are conveyed throughout the Bhagavad Gita\nare applicable to all of us. They are timeless truths that whether you consider\nyourself Christian, or Catholic, or, you know,\nMuslim, or Jewish, or Hindu, these truths are eternal and\nrelevant through all time. So for us as as kids growing up, we learned from and had bedtime stories that came from both the Bhagavad\nGita and the New Testament. My dad was raised Catholic, my\nmom was raised Episcopalian, and both of them were\nattracted to the Bhagavad Gita as they were in their own lives, searching for a more personal\nrelationship with God than they had been able to find elsewhere in their own spiritual journeys. And that's where the\napplication of, you know, there are teachings in the\nBhagavad Gita, for example, that talk about Bhakti Yoga. Bhakti Yoga essentially translates into dedicating your life, striving to develop a loving\nrelationship with God. Karma yoga, there's a chapter in the Bhagavad Gita that speaks about karma. Yoga karma is a word that\nhas become a part of the, you know, both karma and yoga\nhave become very common terms. But what it really means is trying to dedicate your actions in life in a way that have a\npositive impact on others, being of service to others. And so for me, growing up, I never really understood as a\nkid the idea of sectarianism, of one religion battling against another because I knew and\nunderstood and experienced that the real meaning of\nreligion was love for God. No matter what name you worship\nhim by or how you worship, that is the real meaning of religion and the application of\nthat in your life is, you know, you ask, how do I\nsee God in a personal way? I see, I know that God is my best friend, God is my confidant. When I am struggling with a\nproblem in my life or, you know, during those quiet moments by myself where I am anxious or I'm sad, I turn to God for that solace, for that clarity, for that strength to both know\nwhat the right thing to do is and the strength to act accordingly and to constantly strive\nto further develop that very personal, loving\nrelationship with God. - Tulsi, this is an honor to finally\nmeet you, to talk to you.

Eisenhower in his 1961 farewell address. \"A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty,\nready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk\nhis own destruction. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required,\nmake swords as well. But now we can no longer\nrisk emergency improvisation of national defense. We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. This conjunction of immense\nmilitary establishment and a large arms industry is\nnew in the American experience. Yet we must not fail to\ncomprehend its grave implications. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,\nwhether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power\nexists and will persist.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."

There is another way.\" (air swooshing) - The following is a\nconversation with Tulsi Gabbard, who was a longtime Democrat, including being the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. She endorsed Bernie in\n2016 and Biden in 2020. She has been both loved\nand heavily criticized for her independent thinking\nand bold political stances, especially on topics of war and the military industrial complex.

To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Tulsi Gabbard. You've served in the U.S.\nmilitary for many years, achieving rank of Lieutenant Colonel. You were deployed in Iraq in 2004 and five Kuwait in 2008 and '09. What lessons about life and about country have you learned from\nthat experience of war? - So many. Central to those lessons\nlearned was having my eyes open to the very real cost of war. You know, of course, I\nserved in a medical unit during that first deployment to Iraq. It was 2005 during the height of that war. And unfortunately, we\ntook a lot of casualties. We, across the entire U.S. military, my brigade that I deployed with was from the Hawaii National Guard. We had approximately 3,000\nsoldiers who were operating in four different areas of Iraq. And my first task every day was to go through a list of every injury, combat-related injury that had occurred the day before in the country. And I went through that\nlist, name by name, looking to see if any one of our nearly 3,000 soldiers from Hawaii had been hurt in the line of duty. And then if seeing them on the list, tracking them down, where were they? Were they getting the care they needed? Would they be able to get sufficient care to stay in country and return to duty? Did I need to get them evacuated? Usually it would be to military hospitals that at that time were in launch, Landstuhl and Ramstein in Germany. And then from there, getting them to either\nBrooke Army Medical Center, which is here in Texas that specialized in burn-related injuries, or to Walter Reed, and tracking them and their care until they were finally\nhome with their families. And it never became a routine task. It never became like, \"Okay, cool, check the list,\" you know, kind of dot the I's, cross the T's. It was that daily confrontation with the reality of the cost of war. Friends of mine were killed in combat. Experiencing firsthand\nthat high human cost of war caused me, you know, 20\nsomething year old from Hawaii, I had left my seat in\nthe state legislature to volunteer to deploy with my brothers and sisters in my unit to Iraq. And so recognize the cost of war, I think in two fundamental ways. Number one is the high human\ncost of war on our troops and on the people in the country where this war was being waged, and also the cost on American taxpayers. Seeing then, back, is again 2005, and recognizing KBR Halliburton, one of the biggest defense\ncontracting companies then and I know that they're still very much in that business now, Dick Cheney being\nconnected with that company at one point or another, but in our camp specifically, which was one of the larger\nones in Iraq at that time, there wasn't anything\nthat happened in our camp that didn't have the KBR\nHalliburton logo imprinted on it. We had a big shack-looking\nplace where we ate our meals, they call it a dining facility,\na DFAC in the military. And they served four meals a day. They brought in, and they being KBR Halliburton, they imported workers in\nfrom places like Nepal and Sri Lanka and the Philippines\nto come in and cook food and work at this dining facility. I got curious about how much\nit cost us as taxpayers. And so I started asking\naround some of the people, and I think at that time it was like, Well, every time a soldier or a service member\nwalks through the door, if I were to go in for breakfast and grab a banana and walk out, that's an automatic $35 per head, per meal, four times a day, thousands and thousands of people. And then we made friends, you know. There's a pretty large\nFilipino community in Hawaii, a lot of Filipino soldiers from Hawaii. We made friends with the\nFilipino workers who were there. They would often go in\nlike the back of the tents and set up their own like rice cookers and cook their own meals, which is where the real good food was. But just started talking to them and getting to know them and ask like, \"Hey, how much do you get paid?\" And on average it was like, \"Oh, I get paid like 500 bucks a month,\" 500 bucks a month to go\nand do this work of either, you know, cleaning out\nporta-potties, picking up trash, the dining facility, doing laundry, all of these different tasks because the military wanted\nsoldiers to be out doing things that only soldiers could do. Understandable. But I started putting, you know, two and two together and\nknowing that this company, one company alone, was\nmaking trillions of dollars, trillions of dollars, and yet this Filipino mom\nis making 500 bucks a month, maybe getting one day off a week, maybe, working 12 hours a day otherwise. And I said, you know, \"How often are you able\nto go home to your family? Well, they'll let us go home a couple of weeks every other year.\" It was an eye-opening experience that growing up in Hawaii, I frankly hadn't given\nmuch thought to before, but it's what led me, ultimately, coming back from that first deployment, there was no way that I could go back to the life that I had left behind. And I knew somehow, some way, I needed to find a way\nto use those experiences to try to make a positive impact,\nto try to influence those, I mean, frankly, the politicians who are\nmaking decisions to go and launch these regime change wars and send our men and\nwomen in uniform into war. And to what end, ultimately? - If we can just go back to that list. - [Tulsi] Yeah. - So the list is just name\nand injury, name and injury. - Name, unit, potentially location, if someone had documented\nthat, and their injury. - And it's just pages and pages of that. - Yeah, yeah. And I knew, you know, I didn't\nget to call home every day, but when I called home\nand talked to my parents, I felt the tension in their voice. And, you know, they didn't want me to worry\nabout anything at home. And so they were always like, \"Hey, how are you? What can we send you?\" And this and that. But, you know, it wasn't like I was calling\nthem from down the street and saying, Hey, how's it going? Let's go have lunch or whatever. And so I knew that the\nreason for that tension was they were terrified of\ngetting a phone call delivering the worst possible news. And that was what I thought\nof as I went through that list of how, you know, it\nis the reality of war. Behind every one of those names\non that list was, you know, a husband or a wife, parents,\nyou know, sons and daughters, family members who had no idea what we were dealing with, really. All they knew is what\nthey saw on the news. And what my dad told me\nlater when I got home after that deployment was that\nevery time they saw the news and they saw a helicopter shot down or crashed or some IED, they held their breath until they saw or heard the news of who\nit was or what it was. - What can you say about\nwhat the soldiers had to go through physically\nand psychologically when they get injured? - The physical, you know, I mean, some injuries appeared\nto be minor upfront. At that time, traumatic brain injury was not something that was talked about much, if at all. And so, you know, many had visible wounds. Others are now what we know were, appeared like, \"All right, cool. He checked out,\" but had invisible wounds. Those who were injured in a way that did not allow them\nto get back to work, found it emotionally very difficult to be put on a plane and\nevacuated out of there, feeling guilty that they were\nleaving their friends behind and not thinking about themselves or not feeling bad for themselves, but instead feeling bad for being forced to be in a position to leave. You know, for soldiers, it's not... Of course, we all have our own\npolitical opinions on things, but when it comes right down to it, in a war zone, it's about your friends. It's about your brothers and sisters that you're serving alongside. It's not about the politicians or whatever insanity is\ngoing on in Washington. It's about getting up and going out, getting the job done and\ncoming back home together. I mean, I had friends of\nmine who were from Hawaii, who were from American Samoa, very culturally tight-knit community who confided in me throughout that, you know, year that we were there. Some of the very infantry soldiers who were going out on security patrols and doing raids every day, just some of the very\ntraumatic experiences that they went through. No physical injury, but creating a kind of\nemotional stress and trauma that as human beings, they were\nstruggling in dealing with. On a positive note, you know, the Polynesian culture especially, but also Asian culture and\nother cultures around the world, our guys found that,\nshortly after we got there, the unit that we were replacing, you know, we're taking the guys\nout on patrol and saying, \"Hey, here's this village, here's where we found friendlies,\" or \"here's where we know that there are insurgents operating\" and they've got allies and lookouts and, you know, showing them\nthe lay of the land, basically. And what our guys found was that, as they were doing these ride-alongs, they call it a \"left seat, right seat\" when you're coming in and taking over, that there was a bit of a tense, even adversarial type of relationship where on the military side, there was an assumption of\nsuspicion or lack of trust just with the locally Iraqi people who lived around the base that we were at. And without anybody telling\nthem to, culturally, our guys began trying\nto build relationships and, you know, for Hawaii and Samoa, and we had soldiers from Guam and Saipan, little things like, you're\nriding down in a Humvee, you've got a gunner in the turret with a 50 cal or a\nmachine gun of some sort. Little things like pointing\nthe muzzle to the sky as you're riding through a town, rather than pointing it directly at where people are\nwalking down the street was a huge gesture of an assumption of, Hey, let's actually\ntalk and become friends. We had our guys riding down the street and throwing shakas out\nto the local people there, breaking bread, sharing tea, and building those relationships. And again, I served in a medical unit and what we saw was a\ndownward shift in casualties from the unit that had\nbeen there before us, simply because of that\nbasic human connection that our guys sought to make. And then gradually finding\nlike, hey, local, you know, people who lived in the town\nright next to us were saying, \"Hey, you guys should really... Somebody was digging a big\nhole a mile down the road. You might wanna bypass\nthat or check that out,\" and finding weapons caches and IEDs, improvised explosive\ndevices and other things that helped save people's lives - On the cost side of things, how is it possible for a\ncompany like Halliburton or others to get away with $40 bananas or however much it was, the overhead costs?\n- Yeah. - Look, what they will\nclaim is that it's expensive to move logistics\nthrough a country at war, but they get away with it, ultimately, this insane war profiteering. And they're not alone, obviously. There are other companies that\nthis is their business model. They get away with it because of their political connections and the lobbyists that they have, the relationships they\nhave with politicians, and ultimately, what President Eisenhower warned against with regard to that cozy\nrelationship between Congress and even what he called then \"the military industrial complex.\" It's been alive and well,\nhe warned us against it, and I would say it's thriving more now than ever before. - How powerful is the\nmilitary industrial complex? As a thing, is it a machine\nthat can be slowed down, can be stopped, can be reversed? - It can be. It's powerful. I don't think you can overstate\nthe powerful nature of it because it extends so deeply\nwithin our government. It's not just those in\nthese specific big defense contracting companies\nthat benefit from it. You look at the revolving door within the Pentagon, for example, where you have both high ranking people who wear military uniforms as well as those who serve as high ranking Department\nof Defense civilians, who are literally working their way into a big payout when\nthey leave that job. We see it with our own\nSecretary of Defense now. He retired as a general officer, went and served on one of the boards for one of the big defense contractors, and then now back as the\nSecretary of Defense. We see the same thing in\nCongress with members of Congress and senior professional\nstaffers in Congress. Same exact revolving door\nwhere you have people, whether they're writing contracts for the Department of Defense, for the company that then\nwins the bid for that contract and then going and\nworking for that company, or those in Congress\nwho are writing policies and doing exactly the same thing. - You have been both a war\nhawk and war dove at times. So what is your philosophy on when war is justified\nand when it is not? - War is justified when it is in the best interest of\nour national security and when it is the last resort, when all diplomatic efforts have been completed and exhausted and war is the last possible route that must be taken to\nensure the safety, security, and freedom of the American people. - So that's a high level beautiful ideal, but there's messy details. So terrorism, for example, - Yes. - The United States' involvement in the war in Iraq and\nAfghanistan was, in part, the big umbrella of the war on terrorism. So, you know, when you decide whether something's justified or not and whether something\ncan be defeated or not, how hard is it, is it even possible? To what degree is it\npossible to defeat terrorism? - Well, first of all, part of the problem of our foreign policy has been how many conflicts, wars, military actions have\nbeen waged in the name of this, quote, unquote,\n\"war on terrorism,\" in the name of national security, legislation like the Patriot Act that violates civil liberties, our civil liberties and freedoms in the name of the war on terrorism and national security\nwhen it's not justified. And so I'll use Afghanistan as an example. I support the initial mission that lifted off shortly\nafter the attack on 9/11, the Islamist terrorist attack on 9/11. It was a relatively small\ngroup of U.S. military launched to go after those Al-Qaeda cells and Osama bin Laden in\nthe wake of that attack. That is the mission that\nshould have been supported and focused on in its execution. Instead, as you know, attention was diverted very quickly to the regime change war in Iraq that was waged on false pretenses. And the resources and focus was taken away from that initial mission\nthat went to Afghanistan. And the war in Afghanistan blew up into something that\nbecame about regime change and governance and the Taliban and less focus on Al-Qaeda\nand Osama bin Laden. And it became this thing that\neven general officers had a hard time articulating,\nwhat is the objective here? What are we trying to accomplish? What does winning look like? At what point do we know it's\ntime to exit and get out? And as you look at things\nlike the, you know, the Afghanistan files and others, the answers to these simple\nand essential questions shifted and changed over\ntime, over a very long time. Similarly, in Iraq, you know, I bought into a lot of what was being sold by the administration and by Democrats and Republicans and Congress at the time. And very quickly, even as\nI was on the ground there, started to have my eyes opened up into how we had been lied to tremendously, and how that protracted\nwar went on for a very, very long time with decisions being made that ultimately served to\nstrengthen terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda, the creation\nof ISIS and others, really undermining our national security interests in the meantime. Understanding the enemy that\nyou are trying to defeat is essential to being\nable to build a strategy. The declaration of President\nBiden, for example, saying, \"Well, the war on terror is over, the war on terror is over,\" what does that mean? Or the forever wars are over. Well, what does that actually mean? I served on my most\nrecent deployment in 2021 to East Africa and Somalia, where al-Shabaab is one of those Islamist terrorist groups that follows the same ideology as Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Hamas, and others. This group has been allowed\nto grow and be strengthened, even though they are\none of the main groups that provides funding to\nAl-Qaeda in that entire region. So any president or politician\ncan declare a war to be over. But when you have an enemy like these Islamist terrorist groups who are still intent on their\ngoal and their objective, which is to, ultimately, establish their Islamic\ncaliphate and, you know, destroy Israel and\nexterminate the Jewish people and basically, kill or convert anyone who\ndoesn't adhere to their ideology, that continues on and they\nwill only become stronger the longer our leaders put\ntheir heads in the sand and then pretend like, oh\nno, this doesn't exist. This kind of war, this war specifically is one that has to be waged militarily and ideologically. And the ideological component to this, which is defeating their\nideology with a superior one is one that I pointed out in Congress during the Obama administration, we, the collective we were failing at, the Obama administration was\nfailing at because they were so afraid of being labeled Islamophobes, that they refused to accurately identify the ideology driving\nthese terrorist groups and instead said, \"Oh, we are\ncountering violent extremism,\" was the term that the Obama administration started to use and was coined and kind of mandated\nacross the U.S. government. Well, you have to know, again, you have to know the\nenemy that threatens you and why they're doing what they're doing, if you have any hope of actually\npreventing their attack, both militarily, and as we're seeing now\nwith Hamas' actions, not only directly in\nthe assault on Israel, but how Hamas achieved their objectives in spreading their\nideology around the world. - If you look at the lessons learned from the U.S. involvement\nin Afghanistan and Iraq, how do you fight terrorism? - Clearly understanding who\nthey are and where they are and why they're doing what they're doing is essential, first of all. And obviously, there are\ndifferent groups, different names. They have morphed and changed based on their locale\nand how they operate. Building relationships with\npeople in other countries, both state leaders as\nwell as religious leaders and others who share that same objective of defeating these Islamist\nterrorists on both fronts and acting as a united\nfront in taking that action. What exactly that action looks like, details on the ground dictate that, details about these different\ngroups will dictate that. But we've seen examples of this before, and I saw this in Somalia. We saw it in some cases in\nIraq where, for example, you have Imams who recognize the threat that these terrorist groups pose to their own people and\ntheir own communities and exerting their influence in defeating the terrorist Islamist ideology with their own teachings of Islam and preaching peace amongst their people. War is ugly and it is messy. It is also an unfortunate\nreality of the world we live in. So while I firmly believe that\nwe must always pursue peace, I'm not a pacifist, I'm a realist, and recognize that where\nthere are these threats, we must do what we can to\nwork towards that safety, that security, that freedom\nand peace that we all want. - If we look at the perspective of Israel in the Israel-Gaza War going on now, what do you do with the fact\nthat the death of a civilian serves as a catalyst, gives birth to hate, potentially generational hate? So in Israel's stated\ngoal of destroying Hamas, they are creating immeasurable hate. What do you do with that? From a perspective of Israel, what is the correct action to take in response to October 7th? - It's a complex question\nwith a complex answer. I think Israel's approach has to be in recognizing that delineation as far as possible. And I know it's tough when you have a terrorist group like Hamas that is so interwoven within the\ncommunity of people in Gaza. But to recognize that there should be and there is a shared purpose there for the Palestinian people to be able to live free and in peace and not under the oppression\nof this terrorist group, just as the people of Israel\nwould like to live in peace and free from the threat of\nattack from a terrorist group that wants to exterminate them. The complexities of what's\ngoing on in Israeli politics is, I think a different conversation, but also one that is directly intertwined with the answer to this question. When you have some people\nin the Israeli government who don't want the Palestinian\npeople in Gaza at all and want them to go and\nrepatriate in other countries, I think that's a big problem, and that further exacerbates this hatred and resentment that\ncontinues to grow there. This is a generation's long\nchallenge, unfortunately, of the resentment and tension that exists between many Israelis\nand many Palestinians that can only be resolved\nwhen there's strong leadership representing both peoples who are able and willing to come together and recognize that the only way forward is to let the past be in the past and find a way towards\npeace in the future. - How do you think, how do you hope the war\nin Ukraine will end? - The only way that this war ends is to do exactly what we're talking about. There has to be a brokered dialogue and conversation about\npeace that has to occur with representatives\nfrom Russia and Ukraine. It is really truly\nheartbreaking to see both how efforts that began just weeks after Russia invaded\nUkraine to do exactly this were thwarted by the\nBiden-Harris administration and other Western powers has cost so many innocent people's lives. And this is where I get... I have friends in Ukraine, I've been there more than a few times. I've enjoyed and appreciated\nthe time that I've spent there. When I hear from my friends about how afraid they are\nof their husbands being conscripted and, you know, feeling like they have to hide for fear of being yanked off the streets, their friends and family members who've been killed in this war, the only way this ends is when both sides come to the table and find an agreement that neither side is gonna\nbe completely happy with, both sides being forced\nto make some concessions, but one where they will both walk away and this war can end. - What's the role of the\nU.S. President perhaps to bring everybody to the table? Do you think that the U.S.\nPresident should sit down with Zelenskyy, Putin together? - Yes, yes. In an ideal world, yes. This should have happened long ago. The question of whether\nor not President Biden is the right person to do that at this time, when all of the statements and\ncomments that they have made, the Biden-Harris administration has made from the beginning of this war essentially point to their objective being to basically, destroy Russia. And that's one of the reasons\nwhy they have supported both the continuation of this war\nfor as long as it's lasted, as well as why they have\nthwarted efforts towards peace. Whoever that most\neffective neutral broker is that that's the best person to do this. The Biden-Harris administration, I think the role that they have to take is actually encouraging Zelenskyy to sit down and begin this process. Those kinds of engagements\nare the most, to me, the most powerful exercises of diplomacy that can't be matched, especially when our\nPresident's foremost role and responsibility is to\nserve as Commander in Chief. And I wish that we had\nleaders who were more willing to engage because I think we'd make a lot more progress more quickly and to find areas both of mutual interest as well as to help deconflict\nand deescalate areas where there is tension or disagreement or adversarial interests. - Well, some of it is\nbasic human comradery. Like people call me naive for this, but sometimes just knowing that there's a human on the other side.\n- Yes. - Even like when it's in private, if you look at Zelenskyy\nand Putin, for example, just humor. Both are very intelligent, witty, at times, even funny people. Yes, this is wartime, yes, a lot of civilians\nand soldiers are dying. There's hate. But if you can look above it all and think about the\nfuture of the countries, the flourishing of a people and the stopping of the death\nof civilians and soldiers, then in that place you can have that basic human connection. - I agree. I don't think\nthat's naive at all. And I think there are so many examples through history that point\nto the power of that, the real power in that. In, you know, the Cuban Missile Crisis, how JFK had to literally find a secret way to communicate with Khrushchev to try to go around the backs of\nthe military commanders who were urging him to\ntake military action, and instead find, \"Hey, we both, ultimately, want the same thing. Neither of us wants to launch\na catastrophic nuclear war, so let's figure this out.\" - Of course, there's examples\nthroughout history, you know, leaders are complicated people,\nthey're manipulative people. So you have like Hitler\nand Chamberlain meeting and Chamberlain kinda-\n- Yeah. - getting hoodwinked by Hitler's charisma and being convinced that Hitler\ndoesn't have any interest in invading and destroying\nthe rest of the world. So, you know, you have to- - He's smart. (chuckles) Don't be hoodwinked. (chuckles)\n(Lex chuckling) - You've met, you've\nbeen criticized for this, you've met with Syrian\nPresident Bashar Assad, and as part of the campaign when, you know, running for president, got criticized for not\ncalling him a war criminal. What's the right way to meet and communicate\nwith these kinds of leaders? - As I just stated, we need leaders who have\nthe courage to meet, not just with allies, but with adversaries in\nthe pursuit of peace, in the pursuit of increased understanding. If policies are being made through the lenses and the\nbarriers of bureaucrats and the media and others who have or may have their own interests, our President, a leader can't make, even members of Congress\ncan't make decisions with the kind of clarity that we, the American people need them to make. I think that these\nkinds of engagements are weaponized and politicized,\nas they were against me, by those who have their own interests, whether it be the military\nindustrial complex or in Washington. If you're not part of\nthe official narrative of the U.S. government, which was intent on a\nregime change war in Syria, then you're an outcast. And it was unfortunate because, you know, people levied all kinds of\naccusations and, you know, smears against me for going and having the audacity to go and learn more, try to seek the truth in the hopes of preventing\nmore needless war, and in the hopes of preventing\nyet another quagmire and disastrous war in the Middle East and simply foregoing and yes, meeting with Assad. Also meeting with\nreligious leaders in Syria, also meeting and talking with people on the streets of Damascus, talking with college students, talking with people from\nthe opposition party who would like to see Assad replaced, you know, talking with local law, just a whole host of people over the course of a few days, you know, the accusation was of you, like, \"Oh, she loves dictators.\" It's a sad state of affairs when some of the most\ninfluential voices in our country will label someone a lover\nor supporter of dictators, simply because you're saying, \"Hey, we shouldn't be going\nto war. There is another way.\" And I'm not alone in this. You know, people who were\nagainst the war in Iraq were given similar labels until it became, you know, popular in our politics to\nhave been against the Iraq war. We see the same thing now with people like Tucker, myself and\nothers, who are saying, \"We should not be waging this proxy war against Russia, via Ukraine, and using the Ukrainian\npeople's lives in this war.\" Well, now all of a sudden, you're a Putin lover or a\nPutin puppet or whatever, you know, the traitor, treason, all of these accusations\nthat are used, ultimately, by people who are not interested in having a substantive conversation\nabout the truth, about looking at these wars\nand conflicts, you know, with a comprehensive view on exactly all the\ndynamics that are at play. And that's what I found when I came back. When I went to Syria, looking forward to coming back and shedding light on different\nperspectives, experiences, and stories that I found that would give people a\nmore broad understanding of what was happening in that country, and what I found was\nthere was zero interest in the mainstream media or in Congress in hearing any other perspective other than their own, which was, \"We need to launch this regime change war through the use of arming and equipping known terrorists within Syria\nto overthrow the regime\" without them stating any realistic idea of who would take control\nonce Assad was overthrown. But the reality actually being that no matter which opposition group they might try to prop up, they would not have the power to withstand the terrorist\ngroups whose stated goal was to go and take over power from Assad. They had no interest in trying\nto gain true understanding. And it was very disheartening, it was very disheartening\nand a big lesson learned about where their interests\nreally were focused. - Yeah, it's a simplistic\nnarrative template that's fit into every single situation. A lot of stuff is not talked about in the Russia-Ukraine war. One of the things that's\nnot talked about is, Okay, so Putin is overthrown, then who do you think\nwill come into power? - [Tulsi] Exactly. - And one of the things I\ntalk about with our stoics is that Putin, and he gets\ncriticized for this, that Putin, out of all the\npeople that might take power, is the most liberal, is the most dovish. - [Tulsi] Mm. - In fact, every indication shows that\nhe really hates this war. - [Tulsi] Mm. - And so everybody that will step in, if he steps down or if he is overthrown, is just going to accelerate this war and the expansionism and\nthe thirst for empire and all that kinda stuff that the U.S. military industrial\ncomplex will feed into. So you have to think about\nwhat the future holds and what the different power players are and what the level of corruption there is and sort of the realistic\nview of the situation versus the idealistic\nview of the situation. - Just on that note real quick, I think that was exposed in broad daylight when it appeared that, you know, the former head of the Wagner group was about to try to launch a coup and how that was so\ncelebrated even on, you know, like MSNBC and Rachel Maddow and others touting that this was somehow\ngoing to be a great thing without looking at, you\nknow, who is this guy really, what has he been doing in different countries around the world and what would be his kind of ruling philosophy and how that would differ or\nbenefit American interests or the interest of security and peace. - But also the interest\nof Ukraine or Russia and humanity overall-\n- True, true. - just the flourishing of nations, which is great for everybody and collaborations with nations. - [Tulsi] I agree. - Friendly competition. You know, one of the things I love about the 20th century is the friendly, sometimes not so friendly competition between the Soviet Union\nand the United States in space, in the space race.\n- Mm. - That's created some\nincredible engineering and scientific breakthroughs\nand all of this, and also made people dream about like reaching out to the stars and war destroys all of that-\n- Yeah. - or damages it,\nhopefully just damages it. Hopefully, the phoenix will rise again. Well, let me ask you about\nthe criticism you've mentioned of this probably the most\ncommon criticism of you that you love Putin. So just to linger on it, what do you think is the\nfoundation of this criticism? - Well, I'll tell you when it began. You know, my first day in Congress\nwas January 3rd, 2013. I believe it was the third, fourth, fifth, somewhere around there. And my last day was January 3rd, 2021. Given my experience of serving as a soldier in the Middle East and the motivation that really drove me to run for Congress in the first place, I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee\nfor almost eight years, the eight years that I was there with my drive and motivation\nto actually be in a position to challenge the influence of the military industrial complex to try to prevent us from\nneedlessly going to war. And so, you know, the likes of Hillary Clinton and the cabal of warmongers in Washington, they weren't fans of\nmine, to say the least. I can't say it was a total surprise, but it was nonetheless that\nthe very day that I announced my candidacy that I was\nrunning for president, which was in February, 2019, the hour that I walked up onto that stage to announce my candidacy,\nit was in Hawaii, and I gave my announcement speech, NBC News published a hit piece that planted the seeds of\nsuspicion in voters' minds that somehow I was a darling of Putin and Russia and whatever. It was baseless, all of it baseless, and that continued like a steady drumbeat throughout my candidacy. But that really was escalated when, in a podcast with David Axelrod,\nHillary Clinton said, oh, \"Well, the Russians are grooming her,\" and this is not, I mean this came from a very influential person.\n- Yeah. - She was the former Secretary of State, former U.S. Senator, former First Lady, someone who wielded and\ncontinues to wield a lot of power in the Democratic\nParty and amongst voters. And that took it to a whole new level. What is the basis for this? Nothing. It is a tired, yet dependable playbook that is used not only by\npeople like Hillary Clinton, but also people like\nMitt Romney and others to try to smear, discredit, and destroy the reputations of people who have the audacity to question their objectives as they\ncall for one war or another, or have the audacity\nto say that this is not in the best interest of peace or in our country, in\nour national security. They keep going back to this playbook, as they do today, because again, they're not willing to\ndebate the substance of one position versus another, which is what we should have. If people feel so strongly\nthat we should be going and waging this war or\nthat war, okay, great. Go make your case to the American people. Go stand on the floor of\nthe United States House and actually have this debate. Allow those who are saying,\n\"No, this is not a good idea,\" to also stand freely\nand make that argument. Instead, they resort to the kind of name calling that tells voters, Hey, you can't trust this person\nor anything that they say. Myself and some of my other colleagues got the same treatment when we tried to pass legislation in Congress that would have taken out\nprovisions from the Patriot Act that are most egregiously violating our Fourth Amendment\nrights and civil liberties, authorities that have\nallowed our government to illegally surveil\nAmericans without a warrant. And as we did, so we're called traitors. We had other members of Congress\non the House floor saying that \"If you pass this legislation, you will be responsible for another 9/11 style\nattack on our soil.\" These are all distraction tactics to try to divert our attention away from what's actually happening. And instead, just tell voters, Hey, you can't trust these people. Obviously, this has happened to Trump, it's happened to Bobby Kennedy, it's happened to people\nlike Rand Paul and others. There's a small group,\nbut a growing number, at least I'm on the\nRepublican side at this point, people who are actually\nwilling to stand up and challenge the military\nindustrial complex, challenge the warmongers in both parties. - Well, people on the left have challenged the warmongers as well\nthroughout the last few decades, - Less so recently. I agree with you, but less so recently, and this is one of the reasons why I left the Democratic Party, one of the foremost reasons. I devote an entire chapter to this issue in my book \"For Love of Country: Leave the Democrat Party Behind,\" going into the detail of some of the things we've talked about, about my own experiences, about what I have learned along the way, but also how, you know, even in the last year or two years, certainly under this Administration, people who I worked with in\nCongress who were Democrats, dependable voices for civil liberties, dependable voices speaking\nout against the insanity of people who wanted to wage\nwar for the sake of war, they're largely silent now. And unfortunately, within the Democratic party in Washington, there is no room for debate that if you challenge the\nBiden administration's position on foreign policy, you're\ngonna hear about it. And what we have seen is that, that's exactly what's happened, and people have retracted\nstatements or just fallen silent. Or whatever the case may be, this debate that should be\nexistent within both parties on the Democrat side, unfortunately, it just doesn't exist anymore. - There seems to be some\nkind of mass hysteria over the war in Ukraine. It was strange to watch\nthat the nuance aspect of the discussion was lost very quickly. It was Putin, bad.\n- Right. - It was a war between good and evil. - [Tulsi] Right. - And in that, if you bring up any kinda\nnuance discussion of like, how do we actually achieve\npeace in the situation, you're immediately put\non the side of evil. - Yeah, which is pretty sick\nwhen you think about it. - I mean it's, you know,\nthe cynical view is, of course, it's the military\nindustrial complex machine, the war profiteers just driving\nthis kind of conversation. - [Tulsi] Yeah. - You know, I hope they\ndon't have that much power. I hope they just have\nincentives and they push people and they kinda use people's natural desire to divide the world into good and evil and fight for the side of good. You know, people just have a\nnatural proclivity for that. And that's a good thing that we wanna fight for the side of good, but then that gets captured-\n- It is, and manipulated. - [Lex] Yeah. - Yes. I admire your hopefulness. I am hopeful also because of the goodness in people and the naturally\ncompassionate nature of people. However, I will tell you\nfrom firsthand experience that what we talk about is\nthe national security state and the military industrial complex, this cabal of warmongers that extends not only within government, but outside of government, extends to many powerful media outlets, they are incredibly powerful\nand don't have any qualms at destroying those who try to get in the way of their power and they've got a lot of tools. They've got a lot of tools to do that, which I think is why\nPresident Eisenhower chose to include this in his\nfarewell address as a warning. Because the only recourse, the only real power that has\nthe ability to destroy them and stand up against them is a free people living in a free society exercising the rights\nthat we have enshrined in the Constitution and Bill of Rights. - I just talked to Annie Jacobsen. She wrote a book on nuclear war, a scenario of how a\nnuclear war will happen, second by second, minute by minute. I apologize, if it happens,\nhow it would happen. It's terrifying. - [Tulsi] Yeah. - It's terrifying how easy it is to start that one person can\nstart it, first of all. And then there's no way to stop it, even potentially with\ntactical nuclear weapons that the machinery of it, how clueless everybody is combined with the machinery of it, it's just impossible to stop. and it's just between the Russian that, the United States especially, and then all of a sudden\nyou have nuclear winter and 5 billion people are dead. - [Tulsi] Yeah. - And they die through just\nessentially torture, slowly. How do we avoid that? How\ndo we avoid a nuclear war? That's something that you\ntalk about and think about. How do we avoid this kind\nof escalation of a hot war? - I think the most essential\nthing, first of all, is understanding exactly\nwhat you have just detailed. We are in this very\nstrange and absurd time where we have talking heads,\nand so-called pundits on TV. We have politicians, we have people who are\ntalking about a nuclear war as though it is a war\nthat can be won, period, and a war that can be waged somehow without that risk of escalation to the point of destruction\nof human civilization. And so they talk about this as\nthough it's just another war. And especially as they talk about the use of tactical nuclear weapons and \"Oh, well, this is small and we think it'll send a message,\" without actually escalating to the point where we're dealing with\nthe kind of destruction that we witnessed in World War II. That's a dangerous thing when it becomes like normalized as, you know, \"Well, we've got this\nnew missile that'll go and it's targeted and it's strategic and it'll only harm this, quote, unquote, \"military target.\" Ronald Reagan was 100% correct\nwhen he said, you know, \"A nuclear war cannot be won\nand should never be waged.\" It was true then, and it's true now, no matter how much these guys who are producing these weapons or those who are benefiting\nfrom that industry try to tell us, \"Oh,\nno, it'll never happen.\" So to me, that's an important first step, to continue to inform and educate and sound the alarms to people. Don't buy this crap because it's not true. And I look forward to\nlistening to your podcast, but the PSA that was put out by New York City's\nEmergency Management Office about what to do in the\nevent of a nuclear attack, you would find it funny if it\nwasn't so deeply disturbing. How they created this\npublic service announcement, they distributed it everywhere across the city, on the internet. I think it was on the radio where you had a woman who\nappeared to be an actor coming in and saying, \"Hey, in the event of when the big one hits, here's what you should do. Focus on doing these three things.\" And I'm paraphrasing, but I\nencourage you to watch it. I'm paraphrasing, but she said, Get inside, stay inside and stay tuned. That was it. And you know, get inside,\ngo away from the windows. Stay inside, don't go outside\nuntil you get the all clear, and stay tuned. Follow our account on Instagram and Twitter.\n- Right. - And at the very end of this short PSA, her closing words were, \"We've got this.\" And it was so disturbing in that it was so completely outta touch with reality. It creates this kind of\nfalse sense of security that, okay, well, it's kinda like, here's what you do when a tornado hits or when a big storm hits, and categorizing the big one, a nuclear attack within that\nsame kind of preparedness that you would want people to have in the event of a\nnatural disaster of some sort. And it is reflective of the carelessness with which people in our government, that careless attitude that\npeople in our government have towards nuclear war and a nuclear attack, even as they set us up for failure in pushing us closer and closer to the brink of a nuclear war occurring, whether it be an intentional attack or as we saw during the last Cold War, one that could be\nlaunched unintentionally. You know, how many near misses were there during the last Cold War? I saw this documentary called\n\"The Man Who Saved the World,\" and it was some like mid-level officer who happened to be on duty and who didn't do what he was told in launching the nuclear missiles because of what they thought\nwas an incoming attack. And it turned out to be a complete mistake or misread on the radar, but\nthat's what we're facing. - By the way, there's so\nmany things to say there, but one of the things that\nan Annie Jacobsen details is just how organized the\nmachinery of all of this is where the humans involved\ndon't have to think. They just follow orders.\n- Mm. - There's a very clear\nset of steps you take and that there's very few places where you can inject your\nhumanity and be like, wait a minute, what's\nthe big picture of this? The only person that can think is the\npresident of the United States. - [Tulsi] Mm. - The president of the United States gets six minutes after the warning. The early warning system says,\nwhether it's false or not, says that we believe that there's been a nuclear weapon launched. You have six minutes before\nyou can make the decision of launch back, initiate. And to me, that's what\nI'm voting based on. (chuckles)\n- Right. - In the current situation, you really have to see that as one of the most important aspects- - [Tulsi] I agree. - of the United States President is who do you trust in those\nsix minutes to sit there? And I'm not really sure,\nlooking at Biden and Trump. Boy, I don't know, but I do know that I would like somebody who's thinking independently and not part of the\nmachinery of warmongers. That's really, I mean, I don't wanna make it\nsound cynical or dramatic, but sometimes in such scary situations and such dramatic situations, you kinda follow the momentum. - [Tulsi] Yes. - When the right thing to do, the right thing for a\nleader to do is to step back and look of all of human history- - [Tulsi] Yeah. - and ignore all the people\nin the room that are like saying stuff because most\nlikely what they're going to be saying is warmongery type of things. - [Tulsi] Yes. - That's one of the things\nwhy I also get criticized for, I still think Zelenskyy is\na hero for staying in Kiev. Everybody was telling him to flee. It was all the information\nwas basically saying the world's second\nbiggest military is like coming at Kiev. It's just dumb on all\nfronts to stay in Kiev, but that's what a great leader does, is ignores everybody and stays. - [Tulsi] Yeah. - Screw it. I'm gonna die for my country.\nI'm gonna die as a leader. And that's the right\nthing for leaders to do. - It's sad that, I mean, to me, that's what we should expect of our leaders-\n- Yes. - is exactly that. And it's sad that having a leader in that position fulfill\ntheir responsibility and the oath that they take\nis seen as a heroic act when we should, like, that's your job. That's what we elect our leaders to do. And yet so many, so many have failed. But to your point, it's not cynical at all to to know that in those rooms, especially\nin these moments of crisis, unfortunately, there are the predominant and prevailing opinion of this warmongering establishment that's not specific to one party is the knee-jerk reaction, which is to go to war or\nto execute an act of war. And this is, you know, one of the biggest of this establishment destroying the reputations of, and smearing and trying to cancel and censor those who are voices of peace or just those who take\na contrarian position and say, \"Well, hey, why don't we just pause for a moment and actually think this through? Why don't we talk through what happens if we take this course of action? What happens if we go\ndown a different path? Let's actually be thoughtful about what our options\nare for A, B, and C, and then make the decision in a thoughtful manner based on that.\" Even advocating for that\nis seen as a kind of heresy in the warmongering\nestablishment in Washington. The cost of their retaliation against those who are reasonable voices, who look at the world as it is not some fantasy that they wish existed, is in those rooms. During those critical\nmoments, people will, even if they know in\ntheir heart or their mind that this could end really badly, their instinct is to\nself-censor and not speak up because they don't want to\nexperience the wrath and ire, whether it be coming from four\nstar generals or, you know, the secretaries of state or defense or these high ranking people in positions of power and influence. They don't wanna be the one guy\nin the room who's just like, Hey guys, let's just take a breath and actually think this\nthrough, what will happen, not just in the immediate response of this action that you're advocating for, but what are all of the\nother people, other actors, stakeholders in the world,\nhow will they respond? And then how will we respond to them? How will they respond to us? Actually go through this\nexercise of, in the military, this is commonly referred to as, you know, \"What are the second, third,\nfourth order of effects that will occur as a result of pursuing a specific course of action?\" - It's weird how difficult it is to be that person in the room. - It requires courage. - Yeah, but like-\n- Which is sad, but it requires courage. - But why does it require, like even just to ask, okay, we've been in Afghanistan and Iraq for this number of years,\nwhat's the exit plan? - [Tulsi] Right. - Just bring that up like\nevery day in a meeting. - Yeah. (chuckles) - Like what's the exit plan? It's strange that that gets criticized, well, war in Iraq and so on. But I just remember,\nthere was this pressure. You can't quite criticize or like, ask dumb questions about, Wait, what? Why are we going into Iraq again? Like-\n- But they're not dumb questions. (chuckles)\n- Right. In retrospect, you're like, \"Oh, they're not dumb questions at all,\" but actually-\n- Yeah, yeah. - required a lot of courage- - [Tulsi] Yeah. - to ask them while still\nworking within the institution. It's easier if you're like an activist from the outside saying-\n- Sure. - \"No war,\" this kind of stuff.\n- Sure. - But within the institution in the position of power\nto ask the questions, like, maybe let's not? - [Tulsi] Yeah. (chuckles) - It seems really difficult.\n- Yeah. - And the same kind of\nthing in the war in Ukraine and just any kind of military involvement. Again, I guess the\ncynical interpretation is that it's the military industrial complex that permeates-\n- Yes. - just the halls of power. - It does. And what is behind the\nmilitary industrial complex? And there are different examples of this. You can look at the\npharmaceutical industry as well. There's a huge amount of money\nand a huge amount of power that wields tremendous influence\nover members of Congress. You know, there are\ndifferent examples of this, you know, across different\nsectors of our society, but I think the military\nindustrial complex, over time, has proven itself to be the most powerful and influential. And that's what is behind it is, is this is why they try to\ndestroy anyone who dares to ask the most obvious questions is because it is about\npower and wielding power. - Well, the good thing about\nUnited States president is they have the power to say F\nyou to everybody in the room, I think.\n- They do. - It just seems like they\ndon't quite take that power. Like you really, people say like, \"Yeah, the U.S. President doesn't\nhave that much power,\" I don't know about that. Just like if you look at the\nlaw, especially in military, when you're talking about war and the military, they\nhave a lot of power. - Yes. - So they can fire everybody, like-\n- Yes. - they have a lot of power. They can stop wars, they can start wars. They have a lot of power. - The position of the\npresidency certainly does. Unfortunately, we have people too often\nwho assume the presidency from a position of weakness because they're afraid of losing power. - [Lex] Sure. - And so they make those\ncalculated decisions not based on what is right or for the right reasons, but instead, driven by fear of loss of\npower and loss of influence. And that's where, especially given all that we are facing, we need leaders in the\npresidency and in Congress who have courage to be\nthat voice in the room to remain mindful of and\nrooted in the Constitution to, even as we are seeing this legislation being billed as the anti-TikTok bill, that's really not about TikTok, it's about freedom of speech. - Can you actually explain that bill? - Yes. This is another, I guess the bottom line, up front, is this is another piece of legislation being expedited through Congress with strong bipartisan support in the name of national security interests that is essentially a power grab and an assault on freedom and liberty. And I'll just say this in, I think probably like the top three things that they're not actually\ntelling us that's in the bill. Freedom of speech. It's our ability to be\nable to express ourselves, whether it be in person, on a podcast, on a social media platform, in a newspaper, whatever\nthe platform may be. This legislation gives\nthe executive the power to decide which platforms are acceptable, for us to be able to use TikTok itself. The words TikTok is not\nin actually in the bill, but it gives the power to\nthe president to decide who is a foreign\nadversary, single handedly, no consultation with or agreement from members of Congress or anyone else. It actually gives the power\nto a cabinet secretary to designate who is a foreign adversary. And if a social media\nplatform has at least 20% ownership in a social media platform, that platform may be banned from doing business in\nAmerica, essentially. But it's not just a foreign state actor that could be named as\na foreign adversary. It also includes a line in\nthe legislation that if... Let's say a person has at\nleast 25% financial interest or ownership in a social media platform. They're an American citizen who may be working or\nliving in some other country or working or living here, but doing business with other countries. If the executive branch\nof our government decides that this individual is\nunder the influence of, or controlled by someone that\nthey deem a foreign adversary, then that platform must not do business in America. And that person, obviously,\nand even an American citizen, is banned from conducting that business. They must divest, essentially. So when you look at, and this is where there's been\na lot of chat around this, when you look at Elon Musk, for example, well, you already have people\nin the Biden administration, even President Biden himself, implying that Elon Musk's activities need to be investigated. Well, he is someone with\nTesla who does business in a lot of countries, including China, and therefore, he must be investigated. It is not at all a stretch of imagination to say that X could be the next platform that the executive branch decides, Nope, we've designated this person\nto be a foreign adversary, and therefore, his business interest for this social media platform cannot be allowed to exist. We've seen this already with\npeople accusing him and X of interfering in our elections. Again, it it's ironic that it's coming from the Democratic party that they are claiming that\na guy who has said himself, he's committed to free speech and is allowing free\nspeech on his platform and is not allowing the federal government to manipulate his platform by deeming which accounts\nare okay to, you know, post their content and\nwhich accounts are not because of disinformation or\nwhatever they claim it to be. It's not an accident that\nthe social media platforms that have been proven to\ntake action at the behest of the federal government\nand the White House to censor certain voices, they're not included with\nor being targeted at all in this legislation or outside of it. Yet other platforms\nthat are not cooperating or collaborating somehow are. So the underlying issue here, this is being sold as TikTok\nand National Security, but ultimately, even as Ron Paul said, \"This is legislation\nthat's the greatest assault on liberty since the\nPatriot Act was passed. - Yeah. It's quite dark that\nthis is just a grab of power. - [Tulsi] It is. - I mean it's not just with\nElon, it's probably with Zuck, with Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp. It puts pressure, it's\nnot just about banning, but it puts pressure for them\nto kinda moderate behavior- - [Tulsi] Yes. - which is a slippery slope. Of course, it's a beautiful dance of power because you don't want tech companies to have too much power either, or individuals at the top of those tech companies\nto have too much power, but then, do you want that power\nin the hands of government? - [Tulsi] No. - The history of this nation\nis a fascinatingly effective journey towards the balance of power and it does seem like\nthis sneaky little thing, as much as I hate TikTok on all fronts. My brain rots every time I use TikTok.\n(Tulsi chuckling) I know it is also, like, the national security\ndangers of China and so on. But it's just like, TikTok, man, just, I just, I dunno, it's so addicting, it's so addicting. So when I first saw this TikTok bill, I was like, \"Yes,\" no pun,\n(Tulsi chuckling) but then they got me,\nthe Trojan horse got me. No-\n- They all, I mean, they all, and you know, and this is like \"The\nSocial Dilemma\" documentary I think exposed a lot that there's so much that these algorithms do in these various social media platforms that's problematic to say the least. Data security and privacy\nis a serious issue. These are serious things. And so let's have a conversation\nabout these serious things and cease these attempts to have our government try to tell us what we are and aren't\nallowed to see, you know, where we are and aren't allowed\nto say, what we wanna say. That's really what it comes down to. - Yeah, more and more trust people to, whenever social media\ncompanies do bullshitty things for the people to make\ndocumentaries about it, to discover-\n- Right. - for great journalists\nto do great journalism- - [Tulsi] Right. - and find the flaws and\nthe hypocrisy in the, like a call for transparency, all those kinds of things that\ndon't trust, in most cases, government regulation\nof technology companies because they seem to\nbe really out of touch that one-\n- Yeah. - they want power. - [Tulsi] Yeah. - They're really intimidated by the power that the tech companies have. And two, they don't seem to\nget at the technology at all. So they're like hindering innovation and they're just greedy for power-\n- Yeah. - and those are not the- - It's a bad combination. - [Lex] It's a bad combination. - The thing here too\nthough is this extends far beyond social media companies. You know, this is a very specific example, but it's one example of many how those who are greedy for power are continuing to try to find ways to tell us how to live our lives. They are increasingly trying to tell us, again, what we're allowed to see and hear, whether it be social media companies or what shows up in a Google\nSearch engine, for example. And if they're not finding a willing and compliant social media\ncompany or big tech company, then they are looking for\nways to reach their hand into those tech companies\nand force compliance. But, you know, in the\nage of disinformation, misinformation, hate speech, all of the excuses that\nare given for government, either directly or\nindirectly through big tech to try to censor certain voices, it really undermines the truth, which is the way to defeat bad speech is with better speech and more speech, whether it's hate speech, or things that you might be offended by, or things that you might disagree with. The answer is not to have some entity with\nthe power of censorship and being the, quote, unquote, \"authority\" to decide what is good\nspeech and acceptable and what is bad speech and unacceptable. It's what you said, let's\nencourage this debate and, you know, encourage people\nwho are inspired by like, \"No man, I saw this thing,\" or \"this thing is happening\nand it's pissing me off,\" so I'm gonna bring a superior argument. I'm gonna show what the right way is. And gosh, what this is what\nour founders envisioned for us as a society in this country. And we would be so much stronger\nwith a more engaged people and a more informed people if we had this and had it supported. - What are the chances that\nthe TikTok Ban Bill passes? - The way that it passed through the House of Representatives with such an overwhelming\nbipartisan support and so quickly, and President Biden saying that if it comes across\nas desk, he'll sign it, I thought it would pass\nthrough very quickly. I'm only slightly encouraged by the fact that the Senate at least\nappears to be saying, Hey, there are serious free speech\nconcerns around this bill, serious civil liberties\nconcerns around this bill. We need to do our due diligence. I won't say I'm cautiously optimistic because I understand how that place works, but their pause at least\ngives people the opportunity to continue to kind of sound the alarm and for people to call their senators and express their concerns with this that are very real, valid concerns. - Yeah, this is really messed up. Just in case we didn't make it clear, I think this is really, really big danger if this thing passes. Even if you hate Elon\nMusk or you're whatever, this is really, really, really dangerous. If the government gets\nsay over the platforms on which we communicate with\neach other is a huge problem. - And there's a section in there as well, just kind of the last piece on this, is if you use a VPN and you try to use a VPN to access this, you could have problems with the law. And you take that a step further and say, well, how would they know? There's a surveillance aspect to that. So once you start peeling back the layers of this really toxic\nonion, (chuckles) it leads, it really leads seriously to a pretty dark and dangerous and oppressive place. - You were a long-time Democrat. You were the vice chair of the\nDemocratic National Committee until you resigned in\n2016 to endorse Bernie. I should say, I love Bernie. I loved him before he was cool, all right?\n(Tulsi chuckling) Anyway, can you go through what\nhappened in that situation- - Yeah. - and with the Democratic\nNational Committee and with Bernie and why you resigned? - As a vice chair of the\nDemocratic National Committee, one of the rules of the DNC required was that officers of the DNC of which we were as I\nthink there were five or six of us who were\nvice chairs at the time, you have to remain neutral\nin a Democratic primary. So you're not, as a party, supposed to be tipping the\nscales in any direction for any candidate during\na primary election. And so I had no plans to get involved for any candidate or against any candidate\nduring that primary and just the hopes of like, all right, we gotta make sure that this\nis a fair and balanced primary so that voters have the\nbest opportunity to vote for the candidate of their choosing. I saw a couple of things pretty quickly. Number one is that the\nchair of the DNC at the time was a woman named Debbie\nWasserman Schultz, a congresswoman out of Florida. And she made very serious\ndecisions unilaterally that many times we found out about via tweet or press release that showed she was tilting\nthe scales in the favor of Hillary Clinton in that 2016 primary. The other thing that I saw\nwas how the mainstream media and those who are supposed\nto be in a position to be neutral arbiters, to facilitate debates and\nforums and conversations so that voters can be best informed in who they wanna vote for, were calling Hillary Clinton\nthe most qualified person ever to run for president in\nthe history of our country because of the positions that she had held as Secretary of State, as a\nU.S. Senator, as First Lady. And yet they glossed over those titles without ever holding her,\nasking questions even, or holding her to account for her record, especially in the area of foreign policy. The job she was running for\nwas to be Commander in Chief, to be the president of the United States. That responsibility to\nserve as Commander in Chief is the foremost responsibility\na president has. It's essentially the one\narea where the president can unilaterally make decisions without... Education, healthcare, immigration, Congress has to actually pass legislation. President can come through and say, Hey, here's the policies I want. Here's legislation that I'll propose, but that those changes can't\nbe made without Congress, working with Congress to pass them. So she was essentially being let off the hook for her record. As an American, as a\nsoldier, as a veteran, that was a big problem for me. And so I made the decision to resign as vice chair of the DNC so that I could endorse Bernie Sanders, who largely at heart, I believe\nis a non-interventionist. He hasn't focused a lot on foreign policy. It's not at the heart of what his focus has been for decades, but he was certainly far more of a non-interventionist\nthan Hillary Clinton, who has shown through her record to be the queen of\nwarmongers in Washington. I wanted to be in a position\nwhere I would have a platform to inform voters about her record so that they could make\nthat decision for themselves so that they could see, hey,\nin this area on this issue, which is incredibly important, there is a clear contrast\nbetween these two candidates running in the Democratic primary. And that's what drove\nmy decision to resign and to endorse Bernie Sanders. And that's what I went on to do throughout the rest of\nthat primary election. - What do you like most\nabout Bernie, the positive? - You know, what I like most about him is, is he is who he is, unapologetically so-\n- Yeah. - both in personality, but\nalso in what he advocates for, and what he's advocated\nfor for a long time. So, you know, you can agree or\ndisagree with his positions, but he is who he is. - Like I said, you were\na long-time Democrat, you ran for president\nin 2020 as a Democrat. Now you're an independent and you wrote an excellent\nbook describing your journey ideologically,\nphilosophically through that. Why did you choose to\nleave the Democratic Party? - In the book, I go into a number of the central reasons\nwhy I made that choice, but fundamental to them is that the Democratic\nparty has become a party that is opposed to freedom, that is opposed to the central\nand foundational principles that exist within our founding documents and that serve as the identity\nof who we are as Americans and what this country\nis supposed to be about. It has become a party that is controlled by this elitist\ncabal of warmongers who are driving forward this,\nquote, unquote, \"woke agenda.\" And we see it through their\nracializing of everything. We see this through their\ndefund the police mission. We see this through their\nopen border policies. We see this through how in their education policy\nthey're failing our kids and how they are pushing this narrative that ultimately, is a\nrejection of objective truth. The fact that it's a\nquestion up for debate about whether or not, well, actually it's not a\nquestion up for debate for them. They are actively pushing for, you know, boys who identify as girls to compete against girls in sports, changing our language\nso that the word woman, the identity of being a woman is essentially being\nerased from our society. And it is the height of\nhypocrisy and, frankly, an act of hatred towards women that they are so intent on doing this, and ironic that it's coming\nfrom the party that for so long proclaim themselves to\nbe the greatest feminist and the most pro-woman\nparty in the country. I go into detail around each\nof these issues and more in the book, but you will see as we go\nthrough each of these issues, fundamental and foundational to every one of them is that, sadly, the Democratic party has become a party that is so consumed by\ntheir desire for power, this insatiable hunger for power, that they are willing to destroy our Republic, our democracy, our freedom, just so that they can try to hold onto to power and gain more power. - So these are just different\nmechanisms for power. The identity politics-\n- Yes. - and the warmongering\nare related to each other in that they're mechanisms\nto attain more power. - [Tulsi] Yes. - You know, you're making it sound like only the Democratic party are full of power-hungry people. So to you... You know, the Republican party, I don't know if you've met those folks, but some of them-\n- Couple of them. (chuckles) - are also in love with power and are, you know-\n- Yes. - at times, to some degree, politicians in general are corrupt, sometimes within the legal bound, sometimes slightly outside\nof the legal bounds. And so to you, to what degree is sort of\nthe Democratic party worse than the Republican party? So I don't wanna paint a\npicture of like this kinda beautiful vision of the Republican party, that they're somehow-\n- No, that doesn't exit. - not power hungry. - Yeah. I'm glad you brought this up. You know, the book, the book details why after 20 or so years as a member of the Democratic\nParty, I decided to leave, and it goes through my experiences and things that I have seen\nand learned along the way, but I also point out exactly\nthat fact in the book. But from the very beginning\nwith the prologue is, \"We should not be naive to think that this only exists within\nthe Democratic party.\" There are very serious problems within both of our political parties, specifically coming from politicians who are driven by this desire for power and who are so afraid\nof losing that power, that they're willing to do whatever they feel they need to do, which centers around\ntaking away our freedom because the more free we are\nto make our own decisions, even if they may end up\nbeing the wrong decisions, but to learn from those things and know that we've gotta\nlive with the consequences, the beauty and messiness of\nwhat a free society looks like. They're so afraid of us because they see us as the people and our freedom as the central threat to their ability to remain in power. I think the difference\nthat we're seeing today is that, unfortunately, we\ntalked about this a little bit, how the Democratic\nparty has become a party where you must walk in lockstep with the leadership of that party or risk being faced with, you know, your reputation being\ndestroyed and smeared and all of these different attacks. And the reason why they do that is to put people like me and Bobby Kennedy and others up as an\nexample of saying, \"Hey, if you step outta line,\nif you challenge us, this is what we're gonna do to you.\" The Republican party has also done that, and they also have politicians and leaders\nwho are more interested in feeding, you know, the thriving system in the\nWashington establishment. But we are also seeing that the Republican party\nalso has some voices, and I would say increasing\nvoices of people and I would put Donald\nTrump in this category who are challenging the, quote, unquote, \"norms\nof the Republican party\" that are represented by people like Nikki Haley or\nMike Pence, for example. You know, the Republican party\nis not a monolithic entity and you know, it means different\nthings to different people. And that's where I\nthink the real challenge in this next election is it's really less about one\npolitical party over another and it's more about our opportunity as voters to select leaders, first of all, to fire those\nwho are against freedom and who are warmongers\nwho by their essence are willing to take away our freedom in the name of national security, and vote for people, nobody's perfect, we shouldn't hold\nanybody up on a pedestal, but vote for those who are\ncommitted to the Constitution and who hold those values that represent the\ninterests of the people. - (sighs) I'm not a fan of this choice, but here we are, Biden versus Trump. So let me ask you sort of a challenging question\nof pros and cons. Can you gimme pros and cons of each. What's the biggest strength\nand biggest limitation of, let's say Biden? - This is a tough question. I've known President\nBiden for a lot of years. I knew his son Beau, who served in the National\nGuard the same time that I did. I consider Joe Biden a friend. He is someone over the years that I've talked to and shared laughs with and spent time with in\ndifferent situations. The positive characteristics that drew me to Joe Biden of the past, they are not represented in\nhow he has led as President. And, you know, I'll let the pundits theorize as to how that is or why that is. But the truth that I know exists, which points to his weakness is that instead of listening\nto his better angels, he has instead at every turn, if you go back and you, you know, I look back to his inauguration speech where he promised to be a\npresident for all Americans. And, you know, during his campaign promise\nto be the uniter in chief, to bring a country together\nthat was deeply divided, that's the Joe Biden that\nI've known for many years, a guy who has, you know, worked with different people with different backgrounds\nand different political views, but tried to find at\ndifferent points in time a way to work together. At every turn, he has done the exact opposite of what he spoke about during\nhis inauguration speech, and has left us as the American\npeople today more divided, less secure, both from\nan economic standpoint, as well as a national security or a safety and security standpoint, and less free as a\nsociety and as a people. - So the biggest criticism\nwould be he divided us or continued the division\nthat's been there. Who do you be the greatest uniter? Like to me, over the past\nfew decades, to me, Obama. You've been very critical of Obama on the foreign policy side on many fronts, but to me, that guy did really good. Maybe some people say just rhetoric, but I think rhetoric matters\nwhen you're president. I think he was, out of all the presidents we had was probably the most\neffective uniter of the people. Would that be fair to say? - During his 2008 campaign, yes. I think that his message resonated with so many people across generations and across, you know, different views, different backgrounds to where, you know, people cried on the\nnight that he was elected because they felt so hopeful. I talked to people and I know people who set aside their entire\nlives to work on his campaign to be a part of this\nhope and change mission that he laid out that\nwould bring us together. You know, some of the people\nthat I know personally, they gave up their lives\nduring the campaign and after he won they\nwent to Washington, D.C. because they wanted to be able to do the work that he had laid out and continued to be a part of this mission that they expected would\nextend beyond the campaign. And they've expressed to me personally how heartbroken they were because so quickly after he was elected, instead of bringing in a new\ngeneration of fresh leadership that was not a part of the\nWashington establishment, he instead immediately chose\nto surround himself with people who were more of the same old, same old, who were essentially part of the problem. And many of his actions after that proved that fear and\nthat brokenheartedness that they felt to be true. And I'll mention one example related to civil liberties that we talked about. He was someone as a U.S. senator who gave some pretty powerful\nspeeches on the Senate floor about his concerns with the Patriot Act, his concerns with surveillance from NSA, his concerns with a violation of our Fourth Amendment\nrights and civil liberties. But when as president, he was confronted with leaked information about this surveillance occurring under those authorities in his presidency, he took this side of the\nnational security state and did not take action\nto right the wrongs that he correctly pointed out as senator and during his campaign\nfor the presidency, which is unfortunate\nbecause he really did build this unifying momentum\nthroughout his campaign. - What do you think that is? Why is it so hard as a\npresident to kinda act on the promises of the\ncampaign, but also just, I mean, his speech is\nbasically anti-war speech that really resonated to me, the fact that he was against the war in Iraq, I believe early-\n- Yes, yes. - early on. - And that was a huge point of distinction between him and Hillary Clinton, probably one of the biggest. - Why is it so hard when you step into the Office of President\nto sort of act on your ideals? - I think it goes back to what we talked about a little bit, which is, you know, what are you driven by and\nwhat are you afraid of, and if you are concerned for whether or not you can get reelected, who's going to fund\nthat reelection effort, who's going to fund the\npresidential library and your legacy that will follow? There have been some documented examples around how he promised to\ncrack down on big pharma, but when push came to shove, his Department of Justice\ncampaign funding was threatened and they chose not to take action even when they had a very,\nvery strong case to make. This was with regard to the\nopioid crisis in the country. And you know, this just goes back to the heart of why it's so essential\nthat we have leaders who have courage and who are focused on doing what we elect them to do. - And who are resistant to\nthe love of money and power. - [Tulsi] Yes. - It's hard. - And we are human, we are fallible, we are flawed by nature. And I'll go into kind of the\nnext one you asked about Trump, the weakness side and the lessons that I\nhope have been learned from 2016 for him and his team is you have to be in a position where you are surrounding yourselves with other people of courage who aren't just thinking\nabout their next political job or their next job, getting a cable news contract\nor looking for fame themselves or looking at how they can\nmonetize their position for whatever their next\nfinancial interest might be. But people of courage who\nknow what they're up against to really seriously clean house across the federal government\nand the corruption and rot that is so deeply entrenched\nin order to truly be effective. And if he is reelected, that is my hope that he's learned from\nwhat went wrong in 2016, that, you know, he went in, you know, with a largely non-interventionist, more focused on peace agenda, and yet he surrounded himself with people who are at the heart of the\nwarmongers in Washington, and who directly went against the policies that he advocated for. On the strength side, I think it's easy to point out because it's also what has caused him to be so attacked in ways\nthat we haven't seen before, certainly not in my lifetime by the Democrats, by the\nBiden administration. Not only in now, but you know, something that started back in\n2016 when he was a candidate. He's a guy who, you know, by all measures has been\nsuccessful in his own life. And because of that, he's not coming in with this\ndesire to please Washington, that many other politicians have. And because he is so willing to challenge the, quote, unquote, \"norms,\" and these are not norms\nthat serve the interests of the American people, these are norms that serve the interests of the most powerful,\nhe is a direct threat. And so that attitude and that mindset of not coming in with the kind of caution that too many politicians come in with, of wanting to be the\npopular one at the parties or whatever it is that they want, that that is the strength that he brings. - Yeah, I just had a\nconversation with Dana White and he's good friends with Trump, and he talks to the fact that he seems to be resistant to the attacks. Something aspect of that\nis it's just the psychology of being able to withstand their attacks that are there in the political game and that can break people. Like you just don't want the headaches. So to withstand the attacks is tough. And something about his\npsychology allows for that. I mean, I guess a question for you also, in your own psychology, you've\nbeen attacked quite a bit. We've mentioned some of that\nsort of misrepresentations and how do you deal with that by yourself? Like how do you not become cynical or overcompensate the other\ndirection, that kind of stuff? - It really stems from having\na clear sense of purpose. I never saw... You know, I've served in state government, I've served on our city\ncouncil in Honolulu and served in Congress, but at no time have I seen this as a, quote, unquote, \"political career.\" I don't have that ladder-climbing ambition that a lot of politicians have. My sense of purpose is deeply\nrooted in my dedication and my desire in my life\nto be pleasing to God and to live a life of service. And what better way to be\npleasing to God than to try to do my best to work for the\nwell-being of God's children. Being rooted in that has made it so that as the attacks are\ncoming from different directions, even as people who I was friends with, former colleagues of mine,\nothers, even family members, even as they have turned away or become attackers against me themselves because of different\nreasons related to politics, of course, it's a sad thing, especially when it's someone\nthat you know, you know, personally and have had\na personal friendship, a relationship with. But I don't live my life\ntrying to please politicians or please the people who\nshow up on TV or anyone else. As long as I am doing my\nbest to be pleasing to God, that is where I draw my happiness from, and my fulfillment and\ncontentment and strength. - So you spoken about the value of religious faith in your\nlife, of your Hindu faith, and seeing the Bhagavad\nGita as a spiritual guide. So what role does faith\nin God play in your life? - It's everything. It is central to who I am, what inspires me, what motivates me, where I find strength, where I find peace, where I find shelter and\nwhere I find happiness. And this has been a constant throughout, you know, times of challenge, times of darkness, times of heartbreak, times of happiness in always feeling very secure in knowing that God's\nunconditional love is ever present. And no matter what else\nis happening in my life, that God is my best friend and remaining centered and grounded in always remembering that\nand meditating upon that truth is, it's everything to me. - The interesting thing about\nthe Hindu God is how welcoming the religion is of other religions, just- - [Tulsi] It's true. - how accepting it is. So in that way, in many ways, it's one of the most\nbeautiful religions on earth. So like who do you think God is to you? Like in the specifically the texts,\nbut also you personally, what does he represent? So for Hinduism, it's\nalso God can be many. There's also like a aspect where it's like a part of all of us? There's like a uniting thing, not a singular figure outside of us? - I think one of the things that's most commonly\nmisunderstood about Hinduism that people don't know is that, that Hinduism is truly\na monotheistic religion. That there is one God, and he goes by many names that describe his different\nqualities and characteristics. And as you pointed out,\nHinduism is uniquely of a non-sectarian spiritual\npractice, essentially. It's not a, quote, unquote, \"religion\" that you convert into or you leave behind or whatever the case may be. Bhagavad Gita, a central scripture in\ntext that comes from India, literally means \"Song of God.\" And the principles that are conveyed throughout the Bhagavad Gita\nare applicable to all of us. They are timeless truths that whether you consider\nyourself Christian, or Catholic, or, you know,\nMuslim, or Jewish, or Hindu, these truths are eternal and\nrelevant through all time. So for us as as kids growing up, we learned from and had bedtime stories that came from both the Bhagavad\nGita and the New Testament. My dad was raised Catholic, my\nmom was raised Episcopalian, and both of them were\nattracted to the Bhagavad Gita as they were in their own lives, searching for a more personal\nrelationship with God than they had been able to find elsewhere in their own spiritual journeys. And that's where the\napplication of, you know, there are teachings in the\nBhagavad Gita, for example, that talk about Bhakti Yoga. Bhakti Yoga essentially translates into dedicating your life, striving to develop a loving\nrelationship with God. Karma yoga, there's a chapter in the Bhagavad Gita that speaks about karma. Yoga karma is a word that\nhas become a part of the, you know, both karma and yoga\nhave become very common terms. But what it really means is trying to dedicate your actions in life in a way that have a\npositive impact on others, being of service to others. And so for me, growing up, I never really understood as a\nkid the idea of sectarianism, of one religion battling against another because I knew and\nunderstood and experienced that the real meaning of\nreligion was love for God. No matter what name you worship\nhim by or how you worship, that is the real meaning of religion and the application of\nthat in your life is, you know, you ask, how do I\nsee God in a personal way? I see, I know that God is my best friend, God is my confidant. When I am struggling with a\nproblem in my life or, you know, during those quiet moments by myself where I am anxious or I'm sad, I turn to God for that solace, for that clarity, for that strength to both know\nwhat the right thing to do is and the strength to act accordingly and to constantly strive\nto further develop that very personal, loving\nrelationship with God. - Tulsi, this is an honor to finally\nmeet you, to talk to you. This was amazing. Thank you. - Thank you, Lex. It's\nso wonderful to be here. Thank you for the opportunity. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Tulsi Gabbard. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some\nwords from Dwight D. Eisenhower in his 1961 farewell address. \"A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty,\nready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk\nhis own destruction. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required,\nmake swords as well. But now we can no longer\nrisk emergency improvisation of national defense. We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. This conjunction of immense\nmilitary establishment and a large arms industry is\nnew in the American experience. Yet we must not fail to\ncomprehend its grave implications. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,\nwhether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power\nexists and will persist.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
