But if I do like a little clunker or whatever it is, it's like, so what? Like, I wouldn't have played\nhalf the stuff that I'm playing if I wasn't constantly standing on the edge of the cliff, like wild. - Why you stand on the edge of the cliff? - Because at the edge of the\ncliff is all possibilities. (air whooshing) - The following is a\nconversation with Tal Wilkenfeld, a singer-songwriter, bassist, guitarist, and a true musician who has recorded and performed with many legendary artists, including Jeff Beck, Prince,\nEric Clapton, Incubus, Herbie Hancock, Mick Jagger,\nJackson Browne, Rod Stewart, David Gilmour, Pharrell, Hans\nZimmer, and many, many more.

      "section": "Jeff Beck",
      "text": "There's a legendary video of\nyou playing with Jeff Beck. We're actually watching\nit in the background now. So for people who don't know, Jeff is one of the\ngreatest guitarists ever. So you're playing with him at\nthe 2007 Crossroads Festival, and people should\ndefinitely watch that video. You were killing it on\nthe bass (chuckles). Look at that face (laughs). Were you scared? What was that experience like? Were you nervous? You don't look nervous. - Yeah.\n- You look confident. - Yeah, I wasn't nervous. I think that you can\nget an adrenaline rush before a stage, which is natural, but I think as soon as you\nbring fear to a bandstand, you're like limiting yourself. You're kind of like walling yourself off from everyone else. If you're afraid, like what\nis there to be afraid of? That you must be afraid\nof making a mistake and therefore you're coming at it as like a perfectionist and you can't come at music that way, or it's not gonna be as expansive\nand vulnerable and true. So, no, I was excited and passionate and having the best time. And also, the fact that\nhe gave me this solo, the context of this performance is that this was a guitar festival. It's one of the biggest\nguitar festivals in the world 'cause it's Eric Clapton's festival, and there's like 400 guitarists that are all playing like solos all night. And we were like, towards\nthe end of the night, and I could tell like Jeff,\nlike got like a kick out of, \"I'm not gonna solo on like one of my most well-known songs.\" \"'Cause We've Ended As Lovers.\" Well, Stevie Wonder wrote it, but people know Jeff for\nthat song and his solo on it. It's like, \"I'm gonna give\nit to my bass player.\" And like, and he did and like- - He took it.\n- The fact that he's like bowing. Like, that... Like, he didn't have to do that, so- - But you really stepped up there. - It just shows what a\ngenerous musician he is and that's evident in his\nplaying across the board is he is a generous,\nloving, open musician. He's not there for himself. He's there for the music. And he thought, \"Well, this would be the\nperfect musical thing to do.\" And it kind of all started, like, when I went to audition for him, which was an interesting experience because I got food poisoning on the plane. And so like, literally\nwhen the plane landed, I went straight into an ambulance\ninto a hospital overnight. The manager picked me up and I showed up at Jeff's door, which is like a three hour drive, like through windy country roads. And he answered the door and he's like, \"Okay, you ready to play (laughs)?\" So we went upstairs and started\nlike rattling off the set. And when it came to this song, \"'Cause We've Ended as Lovers,\" he just said solo and he loved\nit and kept the solo in it. So that's kind of how, 'cause\nthat there was no bass solo before I was playing in his band. So, this whole thing was kind of new. - So even with food poisoning,\nlike you could step up? - Yeah (laughs). - That's just like what, instinct? - It's just being able to differentiate from like the body and from\nlike expression, music. - All right.\n- Yeah. - It's interesting, you said fear walls you off from the other musicians. And what are you afraid of? You're afraid of making a mistake? Beethoven said, \"To play a\nwrong note is insignificant. To play without passion is inexcusable.\" - [Tal] Yeah. - Do you think the old man had a point? - Yeah. Different styles of music\ninvite varying degrees of, I would say uncertainty or unsafety in the way that people might perceive it. So for instance, like the\ntour that I was just on, like playing Allman Brothers songs, like I am standing on\nthe edge of the cliff the entire night and\nif I mess something up, mess it up, like, what even is a mistake? But if I do like a little clunker or whatever it is, it's like, so what? Like, I wouldn't have\nplayed half the stuff that I'm playing if I\nwasn't constantly standing on the edge of the cliff, like wild. And so, I don't care about\nthose few little things. I care about the overall expression. And then there's other\ngigs that for instance, if I got called for like a pop or a country session or a show that in those environments\nthey may want you to play safe. Like just play the part and play it with a great groove and\ntime and great dynamics and don't really veer away\nfrom the part and stuff and I've done plenty of those gigs too. It's just, it's just a\ndifferent, like hat you put on. - What do you get from the veering? From the veering off the beaten path? You just love it? Or is that gonna make\nthe performance better? Like why you stand at\nthe edge of the cliff? - Because at the edge of the cliff is all possibilities and unknown. You don't know what's coming. And I love being there in the unknown. Otherwise it's just like,\nwell, why are we doing this? Am I just like a clown on stage, like showing you my skills or what I've studied in my bedroom? It's like, no. Like, I wanna be like pure expression happening right now and\nresponding in real time to everything that's happening. And anytime I'm not doing that, it's like, it's a waste of everybody's time. - Have you ever messed it up real bad? - Mess what up? - (chuckles) I mean,\nyou know comedians bomb. You're a big fan of comedy.\n- Yeah. - Have you ever bombed on stage? - Probably. I think it's all about recovery, and the more times that\nyou fall off the cliff the quicker you know how to recover and the the varying ways that you can recover to the point in which it's concealed so much that maybe a listener might not even know that you're recovering. - And eventually you learn to fly if we take that metaphor all the way off the cliff, you learn. All right. - I remember one time\nwhen I was really young, well, not really young, but like when I was 21 or 22.\n- What is 18? - Yeah, exactly. But when I was first\nplaying with Jeff Beck and we played at what I consider the best, the coolest jazz festival. It's Montreux Jazz, and\nlike Miles played there, everyone played there and they have the best speaker system ever. I was excited for months and the drummer Vinny was like practicing for like eight hours in\nthe bus on the way there. And everyone was like on fire on stage. And I remember playing a note, just one note that I really didn't like and I let it go in the moment on stage, but as soon as I got off\nstage, I was really sad. And so I sat like on this road case, everyone was out celebrating, I like sat this road case\nwith a sad face like boo-hoo. And then Claude Nobs, like the owner of the whole\nfestival came out to me. He's like, \"Tal, what's wrong?\" And I'm like, \"I played\na bad note (laughs).\" I was such a child. And like, he said all this wise stuff that Miles Davis had imparted to him and like it fully cheered me up. He's like, is there anything that would make you feel better? And I was like, caviar. (both laughing) The dude came back 10 minutes\nlater with this huge thing. - Oh wow.\n- It was a joke, it was a joke but he actually\nbrought me caviar, the guy. But anyway, that's the one time that I remember being\nsad about a performance. Now I'm just like, okay, whatever. Like, it's done. - Was it a physical slip of\nlike the fingers or was it, did you intend to play that note? - That I can't remember. I can't remember if it\nwas just a bad choice that sounded like a\nclanger or why it happened. It was so long ago. But I don't get depressed\nabout that anymore. - That'd be funny if that\nwas like your biggest and only regret in life is that note and that haunted you in your dreams. - And then like I'm on\nmy deathbed and just, everyone's just bringing me caviar because of the one (laughs)... - Joke went way too far."

      "section": "Confidence on stage",
      "text": "You talked about confidence somewhere. I don't remember where. So I want to ask you about how much confidence it\ntakes to be up there. You said something that\nAnthony Jackson told you as encouragement. A line that I really like that quote, \"On your worst day, you're\nstill a bad mother fucker.\" - That's actually a Steve Gadd quote and Steve used to tell that to Anthony 'cause Anthony used to get real depressed if he did a wrong thing\nor not perfect thing. And Steve Gadd used to say\nthis to Anthony Jackson, and then Anthony was my first bass mentor, or just mentor in general. - For people who don't know\nhe's a legendary bassist. - He's a legendary bassist. And I started playing\nthe bass when I was 17 and I moved to New York and I met Anthony and he started mentoring me\nbit in a very not typical way. Like, he like would just sit in his car with me for hours and talk music, and- - You guys just listen\nto music and analyze it? - Exactly. And that was the best\nform of learning, I think. Just like, \"Well, what\ndo you perceive here?\" And \"Well, I heard this,\"\nand just discussing that. - Jazz usually, or?\n- No, all styles of music. And yeah, he told me that story\nabout \"On your worst day,\" because like, yeah, even then, like when I was like 18, 19, I'd get sad sometimes about performances. Like, I could have done this. It's like, I don't do\nthat anymore, thankfully, or I'd be miserable. - So you still, you always\nkind of feel pretty good. - Yeah. Yeah, now I do. Now, it's just I sense\nthe body feeling fatigued. Especially if it's a very long show. Like the ones I just did\nwere three hour shows and we did one to three hour sound checks. So that's a lot of physical\nactivity every day. So I just feel the body being tired, like fatigued, the ears are fatigued. That's about it. I don't really reflect on the show much. - You're almost like from\na third person perspective, feel the body get tired\nand just accept it. - Yeah. I don't wanna identify with it 'cause then I'm like, then\nI'm tired, but I'm not tired. - It's very zen.\n- I'm usually like energized. - It's like with the food poisoning, the mind is still capable\nof creative genius even if the body is gone.\n- Yeah (laughs). - Something like that? - [Tal] Yeah. - So no self-critical component to the way you see your performances anymore? - There is critique, but not in the way that it\nwould diminish my sense of self. It's different.\n- Sure. - I can just kind of look\nat something and be like, \"Okay, well actually next time I'll do this choice and this choice maybe, maybe this would serve the song better. Maybe this would help the\ngroove feel more like this.\" But it's not like, \"I\nsuck because I did this and I'm a loser,\" and like- - Do you think that's bad? Because even when I asked that question, I had a self-critical thought that \"Why'd you ask that question? That's the wrong question.\" I always have the\nself-critical engine running. Is it necessarily a bad thing? - It depends if it's\naffecting you negatively. - What is negative anyway? - Well, if it brings your frequency down and you feel less joyful inside and less you don't feel like complete, you feel less than, less\nworthy of something, than you could call that bad if you aspire to not feel that way. - Yeah, I aspire to not feel\nthat way in the big picture. But in the little picture, like there's, a little pain is good. - That's fair. - So confidence, you seem\nlike in this performance you seem confident. You seem to be truly walking the bad mother fucker way of life. - (chuckles) I kind of,\na word that I prefer over confidence is trust. Because I think with\nconfidence is almost like there's a belief assigned\nto it that I am this thing that you believe in.\n- Yeah, ego. - Whereas trust is just simply knowing that you can get up there and handle whatever is\ngonna come your way. And it's more of an open feeling where it's like, yeah,\nI could do this, sure. But not like, \"I'm a bad mother fucker.\" Like, you know what I mean? There's a huge difference\n'cause I've shared the stage with people who\nhave a lot of confidence and it can be like a brick wall, just like fear is a brick wall. - So, the brick wall is a bad thing? Like the thing you have\nwith Jeff here on stage- - Is not a brick wall.\n- There's no wall. - No.\n- There's chemistry. - [Tal] Yeah. - How can you explain that\nchemistry the two of you had? - Trust and lack of fear, yeah. And also I will say that each individual has developed likes and\ndislikes over their lifetime. And that can be like, in this case we're just talking aesthetic likes and dislikes. So, in this particular case, obviously our likes and dislikes are very much aligned such that the things I do to compliment him,\nhe enjoys and vice versa. But it could be two very\ntrusting open musicians on stage that don't have walls up, but their choices are very different and one person likes heavy metal and the other person likes classical. - Yeah.\n- So, it's gotta be both. - So you guys were good at like yes anding each other musically like- - Definitely. - Is that where you're most at peace in a meditative way is on stage? - It used to be that it\nwould only be on stage. It started with that. That was almost like\nmy way in to flow state and meditation was playing music. And then back in the day when\nI'd kind of crash after shows, I wanted to change that. I wanted to always feel\nlike I'm in flow state. So-\n- Have you succeeded? - I've gotten a lot better. I'm still obviously on\nthe journey, but yes. - So you meditate, I\nthink you said somewhere that you meditate before\nshows or just in general? - I meditate every day. When I'm on tour with my band, I ask that we all meditate\ntogether for at least 20 minutes. And I don't dictate\nwhich type of meditation, I don't put on a guided meditation 'cause everyone has their\nown thing they wanna do. Maybe someone might be\npraying in their head, it doesn't matter. It's just the idea that\nwe all put our phones down and we all are in one room\nconnecting energetically, spiritually, and just letting our lives go for a second and then we\nwalk straight on the stage and it's always really connected. And there were a couple gigs where we ran out of time for that. And I could tell. There was a major difference\nin the performance. - So, it both connects\nyou and centers you, all of those things? - Yeah, but then when I'm home, like I love to meditate and I've tried various\nstyles of meditation and studied various types of things. So, I don't do just one thing. I kind of customize it depending\non where I'm at in my life. - You and the world lost\nJeff Beck a year ago. You told me you really miss him. How's the pain of losing Jeff change you? Maybe deepen your sense of the world? - Hm. It's hard to accept that we won't create something musically\nagain in this lifetime. But in terms of the grief, grief was easier for me because I went through\na major grief period in 2016 and 17, and that was the first\ntime I'd really gone through the process of grief in a, like in a non-family situation. Like with friends and mentors and people that I'd created\nwith, which is different. It's a different kind of connection. When my grandparents died, it's like there was nothing left unsaid and I was at peace with\nwhat was happening. With this when Prince died\nout of the blue in mid 2016, and then Leonard Cohen died in November, that just tore me to shreds because Leonard Cohen was not just someone that profoundly inspired\nme musically and lyrically, but spiritually we had\na very deep connection. And that was the basis of a lot of our conversation\nwas spirituality. And so, at that time I felt\nlike a piece of me went missing. And that was a very long process where I just stayed in my place and didn't wanna play a note of music. I kind of wanted to just\nget rid of all my stuff. So, I had a friend come\nover and he's like, \"You should just, why don't\nyou come to The Comedy Store?\" I'm like, \"Comedy store? Like, what am I gonna go to some store and buy clown suits? Like, what are you talking about? What's a comedy store?\"\n- Yeah. - He's like, \"No, no, no. Like, The Comedy Store. The place where like comedians go.\" I'm like, okay, well,\nI've never seen standup. I don't, I've seen \"Seinfeld\" on TV. That's like the extent\nof my standup experience. So he took me to The Comedy Store and every single one of those comedians like embraced me like I was family. It didn't even take a day. I was like part of the family and I made like 25 best friends. And I ended up throwing\nall my stuff in storage and like finding a little room to stay in where I rented my gear out. And that was me, my rent\npaying was me loaning the gear 'cause I didn't want any\nresponsibilities, financial, I just wanted to be completely free so that I could like just process it and not feel like I had to commit to anything work-wise or creatively. I just wanted to unplug. And so this was like a fun and\nvery different way to unplug because previously I may have just gone to a monastery and spent weeks\nat a monastery or months. But in this case I was\nlike, you know what? This is a different kind of experience. I'm gonna just hang out with comedians and stay in this room and- - [Lex] With no responsibility really. - Yeah, other than to\nreally deeply connect with this grief that I'm experiencing. I'm not going to negate it. I'm gonna really fully connect to it, and I did and it was tough. And then more people in 2017 were leaving, Greg Armand, Tom Petty. I mean, it was like, these\nare people that I worked with all these people and\nlike had great connections with them and they were all going and the world was mourning the loss of these people because of everything that they'd given to the world. Like they'd changed the world's lives, not just mine 'cause\nI knew 'em personally. And so, that was also complicated. And why, for me it was interesting to be grieving the loss of\nthese musicians with comedians. And I learned a lot. It changed my life 'cause I just learned to laugh at absolutely anything. Everything. I mean, my grandpa had a really\ngreat sense of humor too. My grandpa as a Holocaust survivor, and like he could just kinda\nlike, laugh at anything. And like, so I already\nkind of have that in me. But being around all these comedians just kinda like exaggerated that for me, and that really changed\nthings for me for the better. So then when Jeff Beck\ndied, it was like, okay, I've got these tools, I know what this is and I'm gonna go through it again and I'm gonna be on tour\nwith Incubus in two days. - [Lex] Yeah. - And so Mike Dirnt from Green Day, he called me up and he said, \"Hey, like I know you're\ngoing through a lot.\" And I said, \"Yeah, I don't\neven know what I'm gonna play. Like, I really wanna\nvintage jazz bass for this and I only have a 70s one that I don't really think is appropriate. I really need a 60s one.\" Blah, blah, blah. And Mike's like, \"I'm gonna hook you up.\" He showed up to my place the next day with a truckload of old\np basses and jazz bases and brought them all into my\nstudio and I'm playing them. And then I pull one out of the case and it's an Olympic White, just like Jeff Beck, and I play it. And not only did I get\ngoosebumps and started crying, but I looked over at Mike and same thing was happening and he's like, \"Uh, I guess Jeff might\nmight be happy about this.\" And he's like, \"Well, I\ndidn't wanna let this one go. I was just trying to cheer you up a bit and maybe loan it to you for the tour, but if you really want it, it's yours.\" And I was like, \"Oh my God. This is like, like Mike Dirnt\nis the nicest guy ever.\" So, that happened. So that bass's name is\nJeff and it's a white Jeff and I played it on the Incubus tour. But yeah, I do feel like I'm more equipped to handle grief now. - Tell me about The Comedy\nStore a little bit more. Do you think comedians and musicians in some deep fundamental way\nare made from the same cloth? Like, are they spiritually\nconnected somehow? - I think everyone's connected spiritually in the same way.\n- Yes. - So, I think personality wise, comedians and musicians are\nquite different actually. - In what way? - Well, you'd have to subdivide even musicians into\ndifferent categories too, because the thing that I\nappreciate about comedians is that you go to a restaurant with them and like all the\nobservational humor of like, they'll just, they'll notice everything and make you laugh about it. Which a really great songwriter\ndoes the same thing too. And my favorite lyricists,\nlike Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Warren Zevon, they add comedy into their lyric. And like, so those types\nof people I would liken to hanging out with a comedian. It's very different from like, say somebody that is an\ninstrumental guitarist or something like that\nthey're more focused on whether it's like a kinesthetic thing or like a physical\nthing or whatever it is. They're not quite doing the observational thing in the same way. So, I just appreciate, like, my favorite thing to\ndo is go out and laugh. Especially 'cause like, I can tend to be pretty\nanalytical and be in my head. And so, anything that\njust kind of lets me be in my heart and just enjoy life is great. - I think there's a photo of you with Dave Chappelle on stage. What was that about? - So, right after Leonard\nCohen passed away, The Comedy Store threw\nme a birthday party. It was this crazy lineup and like, it was like, I'd play a song with my band and then Jackson Browne\nsat in and like sung a song and then like Dave Chappelle\ncame up and said some jokes. It was like one of my\nfavorite nights ever. Yeah, it was cool.\n- Yeah. - It was a very healing birthday party. - Yeah, there's something\nmagical about that place. - Yeah.\n- It's really special. - Yeah, well The Mothership\nhas some magic to it, too. - Yeah.\n- It's really cool. It's different, totally different vibe, but like, super awesome."

      "section": "Leonard Cohen",
      "text": "- You said that Leonard Cohen is a songwriting inspiration of yours. I saw you perform the song\n\"Chelsea Hotel\" brilliantly on the internet. It's about, for people who don't know, his love affair with Janet Joplin. How's that song make you feel? - [Tal] Great. I love that song. - Which aspect? Musically, the melancholy feeling, the hopeful feeling, the cocky feeling? All of it. Like every single line has a different feeling to it, really. - Yeah, but as a whole piece,\nI appreciate it so much. I actually lived at the Chelsea Hotel and when Leonard and I first met, that was one of the first\nthings we talked about was that I lived there\nwhere all that stuff went down before they tore it apart. And yeah, it's just a beautiful song. - It makes me sad the way it ends. \"I don't mean to suggest\nthat I loved you the best. I can't keep track of each fallen robin. I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel. That's all. I don't even think of you that often.\" You know that line, \"I don't\neven think of you that often,\" always like breaks my\nheart for some reason. - Hm.\n- Like how ephemeral, how short lasting like\ncertain love affairs can be. Just kinda like, huh. - Yeah.\n- Do you think he meant it? I always think he's trying\nto convince himself of it. - It could be both or either. I mean, that's the\nbeautiful thing about poetry and lyric is that it's\nsupposed to be open. - Yeah. I wonder if it's also open to him depending on the day, you know? - Definitely. I mean, the thing that he taught me or his advice to me was\nwhen you're writing a song, look at it the next morning, like just first thing and\nread it and then take a walk, smoke a joint, read it again. Go have a fight with your daughter, come back, read it again. Get drunk, read it again. Wait a week, read it again. Just so that you know from every state and every position that you, the wider the lens is gonna be\nfrom an audience perspective. You want things to mean multiple things. - So, there's one line I read somewhere that he regrets putting in the song, so I gotta ask you about it. It's pretty edgy. It's about, \"Giving me\nhead on the unmade bed.\" - [Tal] Yeah. - You think that's a\ngood line or bad line? - I think it's an amazing line. It's one of the best lines in the song. - Yeah, right? - When he put that song out, obviously he didn't regret it or he wouldn't have put\nthat lyric in the song. I think what happened was that eventually word\ngot out either from him or from somebody else, that the song was about Janice Joplin. - [Lex] Yes. - And so at that point he\nregretted the indiscretion. So it wasn't that he regretted\nhow great the line was, it was just the privacy factor. But then again, Leonard's\nknown for rewriting his lyrics. In his live shows you'll\nsee a bunch of songs where it's like new lyrics and he didn't do it 'cause he\ndidn't like the old lyrics. He just did it because he could, 'cause he's Leonard and it's like, why not have fun with words the way musicians have fun improvising solos on stage? And he could have changed that line in \"Chelsea Hotel\" after in\nretrospect, and he never did. - \"I remember you well\nin the Chelsea Hotel. You were talking so brave and so sweet, giving me head on the unmade bed while the limousines wait in the street.\" - It's so powerful. - That's a powerful line. It just kind of shocks you. - Well, that's what's so great about it. Yeah.\n- Mm hm. But also heartbreaking\n'cause it doesn't last, especially actually to me it adds more meaning once you\nknow it's Janice Joplin. It's like, okay, these two\nstars kinda collided for a time. - Yeah. But but why is it heartbreaking? It could also be just beautiful that they had a little fling. - Yeah, everything is beautiful. - Thank you. - Even the dark stuff. What's not beautiful? Everything is beautiful if you look long enough and deeply enough. What were we saying?\n(Tal laughs) Oh, what do you think about \"Hallelujah?\" Like, what do you think about the different songs of his and what why'd you choose\n\"Chelsea Hotel\" to perform? - Because I lived there and it was like, it meant something to\nme to sing that song, and actually when I put\nthat song out on YouTube, that's when he sent me an email. He's like, \"Hey, do you\nwanna come over and-\" - Nice. So, this is how you guys connected? - No, we met in a rehearsal studio. I ended up watching their whole rehearsal and sitting there next to Roshi, his like 105 year old monk,\nwhich was really great. I remember when I was\nlike shaking his hand, like, so I like, it was just me and Roshi on the couch watching\nLeonard with this band. And we're shaking hands and he grips my hand like this,\nso like doesn't let it go. And he said, he looked at my\neyes, he said, \"Where are you?\" And I said, \"In the handshake?\" - He's like, \"Yes.\" (both laughing) - Wow, you passed the test. - Passed the Roshi test. And then what's funny\nwas that the next thing that happened about five\nminutes later was Leonard Cohen got down on his knees and opened up a jar, I'm not kidding you of caviar. This is not a callback. - Well it is in a way.\n- I know, I know. - In a deep, fundamental way. - He started feeding the monk caviar. - Yeah.\n- And that healed my Montreux Jazz Festival sadness forever. The end. See you later.\n- Do you think there's a kind of like weird, like there's a sense of\nhumor to it all somehow? Like, why does that happen? Why does that happen? Why, like, why stuff like that happens or that the Jeff bass speaks to you. - Why do we need to know? - You believe in that stuff? - In what stuff? - That there's a rhyme to\nthe whole thing somehow. Like, there's a frequency to which magical things\nof that nature can happen? - I'm divided about that answer because I think just things are flowing. I don't necessarily, I\ndon't think anything's kind of like planned out. - Like through time it's\nlike an orchestra playing of different experiences and circumstances that\nare somehow connected. - I think everything's connected. So, yes. - [Lex] But predetermined means like- - I don't believe in the\npredetermined stuff necessarily, which is different from\nwhatever your previous karma is and karma as a whole other\nkind of conversation. I don't mean karma as in\nlike good karma, bad karma, just karma meaning the collection of things you've acquired over this lifetime or other lifetimes. Just whatever that whatever that is, is going to influence your future. - Uh huh.\n- So- - Well, you had a really interesting trajectory through life. - Mm. - Maybe I just read it that way because I've had a lot of stuff happen to me that's like lucky. Feels lucky. And sometimes I wonder like, huh? Like, this is weird. It does feel like the universe just kinda throws stuff\nat you with a chuckle. I don't know. Not you, the proverbial you.\n- One, one. Yeah."

      "text": "- You said you sometimes\nwatch classic movies to inspire your songwriting and you mentioned watching \"Taxi Driver.\" I love that movie. And I think you mentioned that you wrote a love\nsong based on that movie. So, Travis Bickle for\npeople who don't know is a taxi driver and he's deeply lonely. What do you think about\nthat kind of loneliness? - I think that loneliness is a product of feeling separate from the\nworld and separate from others. And that the less you\nexperience that separation, the less you'll feel lonely. - How often have you\nfelt lonely in this way? Separated from the rest of the world? - It's less and less every single year 'cause I work very hard at it. - Feeling what, a part of the world? - Yeah, just meditating and\nstudying scriptures and- - Don't you think that, I mean, isn't there a\nfundamental loneliness to the human experience? Just-\n- In what sense? - That all the struggles, all the suffering you experience is really experienced by you alone? - Is it? - Maybe at the very bottom it's not. - It's kind of all the same stuff. - You didn't feel alone in 2016, 2017? - I felt like I lost a piece of myself that I had given to somebody else. And I feel like people feel that in romantic exchanges, whether\nit's long term, short term, you give a piece of yourself\nand then if that person dies or you break up with that person, you feel like you've lost\nthat piece of yourself. Which I feel like is\nvery different experience than if you just are opening yourself rather than giving a piece of yourself. You're just opening yourself\nto somebody or something. - So, opening is fundamentally\nnot a lonely experience? - Mm mm, no it's a loving experience. - And then losing a\npiece of yourself can be? - Yeah, 'cause you can't really, you can't lose a piece of yourself if you are the same self\nas every other self. - Right, right. So if you see yourself as\ntogether with everybody, then there's no losing. - Yeah.\n- Yeah, yeah. It's a beautiful way to look at it. You said that there's something healing about being in an empty hotel room with no attachments except your suitcase. A lot of people will talk\nabout hotel rooms being a fundamentally lonely experience. But you're saying it's healing. - It's healing, yeah. 'cause I just get to sit there and not worry about all this stuff that like this, these\nmeaningless attachments. I got my suitcase with my necessities or my three suitcases sometimes (laughs), and I can just sit there and meditate and just be with myself,\nand it's so awesome. And usually like you plan\nyour touring for like, you kind of get the business aspect of things taken care of\nin advance so you can kind of just really be flowing\nday to day on a tour. And it's a great feeling. It's funny because this\nlast tour that I did, we didn't have hotels every night. We had hotels maybe like once a week. And I hadn't done that before usually. I'm frequently in hotels, so I didn't get that space that\nI'm really used to getting. - [Lex] You missed them? - I very much missed it and\nhad to be very creative. And I ended up like,\ngoing into the back lounge when everyone was asleep and like meditating back there, or like before everyone woke up. And I actually like joined, there was like an online\nmeditation retreat that was happening. It was like 12 hours a\nday of silent meditations that happens once a year. And I love this particular\ngroup of people, and they knew I was on\ntour so they were like, \"Just join when you can.\" And so I was on the tour doing the meditation retreat at the same time. It was so fun. It was so fun because I was\nlike, in the back lounge, the bus is like moving around like this. My laptop, the Zoom is like\n(imitates laptop whirring), and I'm just like sitting like meditating. It was, it's like, yeah, this is the shit. - It's silence. So, they're all connected to Zoom and just doing silent 12 hours a day? - Yeah, yeah.\n- That's cool. - These particular retreats\nthat I started doing, it's not straight silent. There are silent sits\nevery hour for 50 minutes and then there's some talks, and like these people\nthat I've been working with are really cool because they're integrating\nSpiral Dynamics into zen and it's like the coolest combination. - [Lex] What's Spiral Dynamics? - Like Ken Wilber, do you know Ken Wilber? Integral Theory? - Yes, can you explain a little bit? So, I vaguely know of him because of kind of this\nnotion that everything is one, like everything is integrated, that every field has truths and falsehoods and we should integrate the truths. - Yeah. It's hard to explain how it applies to this type of meditation because it's in the guided\nparts of the meditation that this whole like holonic theory is like brought in about like transcending and including every aspect of your being because he talks about\nlike levels of development and like in consciousness and how like this applies to like every single religion or non-religion that there are these levels of development and that go all the\nway up to enlightenment no matter what you start off with. It could be Christianity,\nBuddhism, Vedanta, it doesn't matter, like anything. Then I just like, I\nlike it when everything and everyone is taken into account. It doesn't matter where\nyou're coming from, that there is a way to be\nself-realized, self-actualized. There are self-actualized beings from all walks of life with\nvery, very different paths. There's no one path. I mean, in this particular retreat I do, there's like a lot of silence sits and then there's some guided meditations. But this, I've tried a\nlot of different avenues and they're all great. So I wouldn't just say,\njust try this one thing. Like I've studied like the Upanishads like with Vedanta teachers and like gone through those texts for months and months and\nstayed at monasteries. And like how they break\nit down makes total sense to my mind and heart and like my, more importantly than my\nmind, like my inner knowing. Like it resonates and-\n- Inner knowing. - Yeah, because like your mind\nis like the thinking tool. Like it's not you, you're not your mind. You're not your thoughts,\nyou're not your body, you know? So it's like just the you. Like, that knowing that you have, that's kind of when\nsomething resonates there, that's usually when you go with something. - What's living in a monastery like? - It's the best. - [Lex] What are we talking about? Like what- - It's just in an empty room\nwith like a tiny single bed and a sheet and a pillow and that's it. - That's it? - You have to eat the\nsame thing as everyone. - What's the food like? What is it? - Very plain, cheap, basic food, which is funny for someone like me because I'm pretty\nparticular about my diet. - Yeah, you brought over like\n20 different ingredients. - (laughs) Yeah. - So what was the like day in the life of Tal at a monastery? - You wake up at five a.m. to the bell and you go and meditate like constantly. - So the-\n- Till bedtime, other than two meals. - Well, how are you sitting? Are you in a group? Is there other people there?\n- Mm hm. - And you're just sitting there? - Well, yeah, if you're talking\nabout the zen monastery, because I stayed in zen monastery and I did a thing with the\nguy I was telling you about that kind of the integral zen thing where he uses Ken Wilber's\nwork in combination with zen. That's a little bit different 'cause he does talks,\nwe talk about things, and that's very separate\nfrom the monastery, like the Vedanta\nmonasteries I've stayed at, which there's very little meditation in terms of sitting silently. Instead we are meditating\non the scriptures, like the Upanishads. And we're like, diving into that. - What were the differences, the takeaways from the experiences? The two different, the integral one and the meditating on the scriptures? - They're both have been\nincredibly helpful to me because the Vedanta, anytime I go into my head about something, the answer is there\nbased on this knowledge. And with the zen monastery, it's like you just gotta\nput your butt in the seat and sit and wait, and maybe something will\nhappen, maybe it won't, but just keep sitting\nand it's very disciplined and you go through a lot. Your body's purging a lot. There's a lot. And you don't necessarily have the answers as to what is happening. And so I think for somebody\nlike me, I need both. I need to be in a place where\nthere's complete uncertainty, but complete discipline and just doing the regimented thing. And then there's the me\nthat feels very satisfied from an analytical standpoint, understanding what's happening. Like, what is the gross and\nthe subtle body and the, like I wanna understand these things about what it is to be a human. So, I like 'em both. - \"Understand what it\nmeans to be a human.\" So that like, having that patience and just sitting with\nyourself helps you do that? - Yes. More so like the analysis part helps. - Oh, so the analysis,\nthe actual, okay, got it. - But sitting with yourself,\nthere's no better education. - Yeah.\n- Of like facing every demon and it's all gonna come out\nand it's not gonna be pretty. But then there's things that happen on the other side of it\nthat are so profound. - Have you met most of your demons? - I've met the demons that\nhave come out (laughs). - Oh, there may be more? - Who knows? Yeah.\n- Okay. Well, to be continued. (chuckles) What, since\nI think I heard you say"

They might think you're\nprimarily a bassist, but you're-\n- But they're wrong. - So, do you write (laughs)\nmostly broken heart ones or like hopeful love songs? In love songs, about to be in love songs, soon to fall in love songs? - Well, the last album I put out, that is pretty self-explanatory\nas to what that is. - A lot of pain that one? - There was, yeah. Some of it was storytelling and some of it was real experience. And it's always like a\ncombination of things. Like, I serve the song. So, sometimes you use\nyour own life experience to tell a song and sometimes\nyou may watch a movie and part of that script merges\nwith your own experience and that tells the right story for the point you're\ntrying to make in the song. So, it varies from song to song. Like, in terms of how like\nautobiographical it is. - Yeah. I always think at the\nend of the \"Taxi Driver\" when what's her name, Betsy, because Travis becomes a hero. She tries to get with\nhim and he rejects her. That was so, that's powerful. - My favorite love songs are the ones where you're not sure\nit's about romantic love or love of God or love of\nlife or just pure just love. Like, I was thinking like George Harrison\nwrites songs like that. Like, \"What Is Life?\" Or like Bob Dylan song that\nGeorge Harrison covered, \"If Not for You.\" - [Lex] Yeah, I was just\ngrateful for his love, yeah. - Right, right. That's kind of like where, well, what I'm experiencing now. And so, who knows what will\nend up coming out, but- - So, you've been writing this kinda- - Yeah, I've been writing.\n- A little bit? - I don't have like an intention of like putting something out in any particular timeframe, but I'm just writing\nand letting things flow and yeah, there's like a bunch of like Leonard Cohen\nsongs to where you're like, there's so many ways\nto interpret this song. And there's so many ways... I just love songs that don't, aren't like, so like specifically about one thing. - Mm hm. I really love the song to play it, to listen to \"Wonderful\nTonight\" by Eric Clapton and I thought it was\npretty straightforward. - Yeah.\n- And then I had a conversation with Eric Weinstein who's a mutual friend of ours. - Yeah.\n- And he told me it's not about what I thought it's about. - Oh yeah, what did he say? - It's a more complicated story. It's actually a man. So, \"Wonderful Tonight\" is\na story about a man being, just finding his wife beautiful and appreciating it throughout. But he said it was actually\na man missing his wife, that he's imagining that she's lost because of the decisions\nhe's made in his life, so it's pain.\n- Hm. - And he had a long\nbeautiful Eric Weinstein like explanation of why. - I love those. - Have you and Eric played music? - No, we've just hung out and had very long\nconversations about everything. - He's a bit of a musician, you know? - Yeah.\n- Okay."

      "section": "How to learn and practice",
      "text": "You picked up the guitar when you were 14. Let's go back. And one interesting thing that just jumped out at\nme is you said you learned how to practice in your head because you only had 30 minutes. - Yeah.\n- Your parents would only let you practice for 30 minutes. - Yeah. - I read somewhere the\nColtrane did the same. He was not the practice part, but he was able to play\ninstruments in his head as a way to like think\nthrough different lines, different musical thoughts,\nthat kind of stuff. - Yeah.\n- And just maybe can you tell the story of that? - Yeah, I just grew up in a environment that was focused on academia. - Yeah.\n- And I fell in love with guitar and really just\nwanted the focus to be that. So, my limit was 30 minutes a day for, I don't even remember\nhow many times a week. Might've been every day or\nfive days a week, whatever. - So your parents didn't want\nyou to play more than that? - No. And so I just learned how to visualize the fret board in my head and I'd practice all day in my head. It was kind of like, you\nknow \"The Queen's Gambit,\" the TV show with Anya\nTaylor-Joy and she just like sees it on the ceiling.\n- On the ceiling. - I used to do that with the front board. Yeah, and just practice.\n(Lex laughs) And I actually recommend\nit to every musician because if you're just practicing here, you don't know what is\nmore dominant necessarily. Is it this or is it your motor skills? If you just take that away and do it here, you know you've got it. So, I'm glad that that happened and that I learned how to do that. And in terms of like learning fast, 'cause like I had to like learn how to, well, I had to try to\nabsorb a lot of information in a short amount of time when\nI did have the instrument. I kind of would like do things in bursts. Like even in that half\nan hour I would just go, like play for a couple minutes and then I'd stop for like a minute and then I'd do it again. And I noticed there was\nlike a huge difference between the first time and the second time whereas if I just kept repeating stuff, it would be like much slower. - Well, what did you do\nin the, when that minute- - Just hang out. - Just integrate, like-\n- Yeah, just like my brain. It's like my brain was telling me like, just chill out for a sec. That's enough information. Let me take a second to integrate that. That's what at least\nwhat it felt like to me. And the most hilarious thing\nhappened a couple months ago. I know you're friends\nwith Andrew Huberman. So he put out some clip,\nwhich was a part of one of his podcasts about learning. And he said that there\nwas some research done on learning fast and that\nif you practice something for a minute or so and then you let your brain rest for 30\nseconds or a minute, that in that 30 seconds or a minute your brain does the repetition 20 to 30 times faster and in reverse. And I was like, whoa, that's so cool 'cause that's what I used\nto do when I was a kid. Like, now there's science that proves that which is really cool for musicians to know that that's a good way\nto practice efficiently because you know, like some musicians, they're like practicing for\nsix, seven, eight hours a day. I've never done that. I've never practiced more\nthan an hour a day even now. Like, I've just, that's\nmy technique and it works. - Are you also practicing\nin your head sometimes? - Now I'm not practicing as much. I'm more always writing songs in my head. So that's why I like silence. That's why I love being\nin the empty hotel room and being alone or songs come\nto me while I'm showering or walking around doing the dishes, or occasionally when I'm\nhanging out with friends or like comedians and people\nwill just like say shit and I'll be like, that's a cool line. Just like jot it down on my phone. - So it's not always musical,\nit's sometimes lyrical. - It's more lyrical than musical now because it's like, for me it's like, well, there's so much music in the world. If I'm going to write a song, I want the song to be about\nsomething interesting. And so yeah, the words matter to me. - Yeah, and the right word\ncan, has so much power. It's crazy.\n- Yeah. - Like we said with Leonard Cohen and then they're often simple. The really powerful ones are simple. - And like you, when you\nmentioned \"Hallelujah,\" he wrote like 80 verses to \"Hallelujah\" before he narrowed it down to like four and it took him like 15, 20\nyears to write that song. So, some writers will do that, like, and then other writers just vomit it out and it's beautiful. Like, I've heard that Bob\nDylan or Joni Mitchell, they're like, they're fast writers. They just kinda, it just kinda comes out. - That makes me feel so good\nto know Leonard Cohen wrote so me verses of that, like that that was so\ndeliberately crafted. Extensively, rigorously crafted. - He just would spend months and years and constantly refining and refining. - Do you have songs like that for yourself where you've refined for many years? - Yeah, it's song dependent. Some just flow out and\nit's like, oh there it is. Everything's there. And then other songs, it's like, you might have\nstarted it with music and there's some words that come out and then trying to fill\nin the rest of the word. Sometimes it can be like a\nsquare peg in a round hole and other times it's\nlike, \"Oh no, I can...\" It depends. Sometimes it becomes like a math problem and hopefully it doesn't 'cause you just wanna say what's right for the song. And usually when you write it all together like the lyric and the melody and the chords and everything's kind of developing at once, at least for the first draft, that's very, very helpful. Like Sondheim used to write like that. Just like he wouldn't move on until like, he would just go this way. Whereas for me it's just like,\nI'll just go with what seems to be coming naturally and\nI'll just let it be what it is and then you come back and you say, okay, well, what do I\nhave to do to this now? Well, what's needed? - Just to linger on the learning process, what would you recommend\nfor young musicians on how to get good? What are the different\npaths a person can take to understand it deeply enough\nto create something special? - I think first and foremost understanding why you are playing music. If it's 'cause you have something that you're trying to express or that you're just in love\nwith expression itself, with art itself, those are great reasons to start this journey. - The why should be- - I think the why is really important 'cause it's a jagged lifestyle\nand there's a lot in it. And so, if you don't have your purpose, if you're not centered in your purpose, then all that jagged lifestyle\nis probably gonna get to you. - Jagged? That's an interesting word.\n- Jagged. Yeah, it's jagged. It's all over the place, it's uncertain. It's one thing one moment and a completely different\nthing another moment. You never know what's gonna happen. And if you thrive on variety,\nwhich I love variety, then it's perfect but also every human being needs a certain amount of certainty and structure. And so it's, the certainty can\ncome from your inner knowing, knowing that you're doing exactly what you want to be doing and knowing what your purpose is in doing it, in this expression. Otherwise you're just kinda\nlike a leaf blowing in the wind. - Like in the early days touring, just playing clubs seems like tough. - Yeah.\n- It's a lot. - Yeah, it's a lot of like, the physical labor aspect\nof it is really hard. Playing on stage to two\npeople or 2,000 or 20,000, that doesn't make a difference. I mean, it makes a difference\nto the ticket sales, which informs what level of luxury you might\nhave on the road or not. But other than that it's just people there listening to music. The music doesn't change. - Does it make it tougher when\nit's two people versus 200? - No. - So even if nobody recognizes whatever the thing you're doing. - No, because the idea is to be doing, like, having a great\nconversation on stage. - The audience can come and go. - Yeah. I mean, I always like... At like, there's certain points in shows where I'm just like, I consciously am like, oh yes, there's an audience over there because I'm so like wrapped up in whatever's happening on stage. - You forget yourself. - Well, maybe I'm remembering myself. - [Lex and Tal] Oh! - Damn.\n(Tal laughs) Call back somehow, feels like one. Okay. You think every instrument\nis its own journey as you play guitar, you\nplay bass, you sing. Just the mastery of an instrument, or let's avoid the word mastery, the understanding of an\ninstrument is its own thing or are they somehow like\nphysical manifestations of the same thing? - It's both, like every instrument has its strengths, beauty,\nlimitations, range, like possible range that can be extended to some degree or another\ndepending on who you are. Like trumpet or something, like certain people can hit\nhigher notes than others, blah, blah, blah. But that being said, we're\nall playing the same 12 or 24 or however you divide the octave, that many notes, we're all\nplaying the same notes. So, in that sense it's all the same thing. It's just music or better yet it's just art or expression. But yeah, every instrument has, you gotta go through the\nphysical aspects of it, the motor skills and all of that. And hopefully you get\nthrough that really quickly so you can get to the expression quickly 'cause if you get stuck\nin just that first phase, that's be really boring. - Yeah, but that's a pretty long phase. The technical skill required\nto really play an instrument. - For some people it's a long thing and some people it's short. It very much varies. It might have to do\nwith like how you learn and getting to know like,\nyour strengths in learning, like more oral or more\nlike, is it more like... Like what's your strength and playing off of those strengths. So, for me, like it was,\nlike I was saying earlier, it was just an intuitive\nthing that I knew, I can feel when my brain is full, like that it needs processing time. And so, I listen to that. I don't push past it, even\nif it's like one minute and I do something, I'm like, okay. Silence. And then I come back and it's in and I trust that it's gonna\nbe there and is there. So, just trusting yourself\nI think is really important. Trusting that you know you better than anybody else is gonna know you. So, that's the kind of thing with teachers that can be either really,\nreally helpful and great or really not great. Like, I'm primarily self-taught. I've had amazing mentors\nof all walks of life and I think I'm unbelievably blessed that my mentors are some of\nmy favorite musicians on earth whether it's Leonard Cohen or\nJeff Beck or Wayne Shorter, whoever these people are, like, they are my favorite musicians. So, not everyone has that opportunity, but what the opportunity that we have now that I didn't have when I was starting is that everything's on YouTube. Like every interview with every genius, like you don't need to necessarily have these people in person now. I mean it, and then I'll\nsay to that, yes and no. I agree with myself and then\nI don't agree with myself. And the reason is, I do\nbelieve that there is something that happens when you're\nin person with a master in some cases that there\nis something transferred that is not intellectual, it's not spoken, it's something else that happens, that can happen that I've experienced and I really value that. - And I think that applies to specific disciplines\nand also generally. Like, I've been around\nOlympic gold medalists just to hang out with\nthem for several days. And there's something about greatness. There's a way about them that kind of permeates\nthe space around them. You kind of learn something from it. - Yeah.\n- Even if you don't practice that particular discipline. - Yeah.\n- There's something to it. If you're able to see it. I also like what you said about the playing stuff in your head, that it forces you to not be lost in the physical learning\nof the instrument. I think that's one of the things I probably regret a little bit. So, I play both piano and guitar and I've have become quite over the years technically proficient at the instruments.\n- I've seen. - But I think my mind is\nunderdeveloped because of that. Meaning like, I can't really, like, I can feel the\nmusic when it's created, but I can't create out of the feeling. I haven't practiced the projecting the feeling onto the music,\n- Oh, yeah? - you know what I mean? - [Tal] Hm. - And I'm not like a musician, but I'm just, it's a different muscle that I think is, if you really want to create beautiful things, you have to, the creation happens here, not with your hands.\n- I think it's more here. - Or whichever. It's some part of the body, but it's not with your fingers. - Yeah, 'cause I think\nthe fingers is more this. - [Lex] Sure. - And then-\n- Yes. Yeah, it is here.\n- Yeah. - Right. And it's just nice that you said that 'cause it's probably really, it's really good advice\nif you wanna create. - Yeah, slowing down is really great too. - [Lex] What do you mean slowing down? - Slowing everything down. It could be, I can play\nsomething really fast, but I may wanna like practice it. Let's see. Like... (slow bass music playing) - [Lex] Go as slow as possible. - Because there's all\nthese micro movements that are happening that if you just go... (fast bass music playing) Like, you can't pay as close attention to the exact tone that you're\npulling from each note. And there's a lot to pay attention to, to how my fingers are\ntouching the string here. Like, I can change my tone a million ways just by the direction of this finger. And same with how this lands and how hard I'm attacking the string and with what intention\nam I hitting the string? Emotionally, physically. And so, even if you can go\nblah, blah, blah, blah, blah, play that so slow. See how locked into a pocket you can be. See how you... Like, feel every aspect of that 'cause then when it gets sped\nup, it's still there with you. Yeah.\n- Mm hm, that's brilliant. - It's kind of like the transcended and included thing that\nKen Wilber talks about. Like, it's like- - And I guess that's what\nmeditation can do for you is to like really listen to your, like, observe every aspect of your body, the breath and all this. Here you're observing every element, like every super detailed\nelement of playing a single note. - [Tal] Yeah. - That's cool that if you speed it up, it's still there with you. - It is. Yeah, it is because I hear\nthere are certain people, it's like they play really fast, but I don't hear the\nfullness of tone always. And it's like, well, it's probably 'cause maybe they didn't, maybe it's 'cause they didn't slow it down and really sit with each note and let it like, resonate\nthrough their whole being. It's spiritual, it's like\na spiritual expression. It's not just like, it's not a sport. A lot of people treat music like a sport. - Yeah. Since starting to learn\nmore like Stevie Ray Vaughan versus Jimi Hendrix, I would spend a quite a long time on single notes of just bending. Just like, just listening\nto what you can do with bends, spending. Just thinking like, people like B.B. King and all these blues musicians, like spend a career just\nmaking a single note cry. - [Tal] Yeah. - There's like an art form to that. - [Tal] Yeah. - And I think you putting it, like taking it really slow, which I never really thought\nof is really good idea. Like, really slow it down. - It's the same with like\nsitting with your own emotions. It's like when emotions\nare overwhelming to us, we get real busy or we move real fast 'cause it's like we don't\nwanna feel our feelings. And those are the moments\nto slow yourself down. - And observe it. Anger, jealousy, loneliness.\n- And just be with it. Yeah, just be with it. Be like, be cool with it. Like love it, love the anger and- - It's all beautiful. (Tal laughs)"

      "text": "Can you educate me on the\ndifference between bass? - Base and bass? Okay, well, one is a fish. - (laughs) At least I\npronounced it correctly. That's good. It's all about the piece. - Can you pronounce my name? - Tal.\n- Wow. Most people say Tal, or Tal.\n- Tal. - You said Tal.\n- Who says Tal? - Like, so many people. - In the south maybe Tal.\n- I don't know, but the fact that you said my name right, you get extra points.\n- Oh, honey Tal. I didn't know it was a game. Am I winning?\n- Yep. - I like winning. (Tal laughs) - How do you play the bass? What's the difference between\nfinger style and slap? - Slap is like this,\nfinger style is like this. - You ever ever played bass with a pick? - Yeah, sometimes. - I'm not accusing you of anything. - No accusation taken. - I don't know if these are\nsensitive topics, like if- - That would be pretty hilarious if I was sensitive about bass techniques, but like, not about like love. - It just looks so cool to like slap it and I don't understand what that's about. Like that thumb thing that- - Yeah. I slap less, a lot less. Almost never actually. It has a very distinctive sound and does a very\ndistinctive thing to a song that is not something I hear needed very often in music today. - Yeah. - But in certain styles like funk it sounds awesome and it makes sense. It was something that was a\nbit overused at one point. For instance, like my\nmentor Anthony Jackson, he refused to slap. Like, he actually said,\nif you want me to slap, I'll leave this gig. So, I'm not like that. - See, that's why I said sensitive. See I was like reading into it. - Because he's sensitive about it. - I was feeling the spiritual energy of the sensitivity\n- Yeah, of Anthony Jackson? - of Anthony Jackson. - And then, I mean, I'm\nplaying electric bass, so generally speaking,\nyou don't particularly wanna hear electric bass on\nstraight ahead jazz anyway. You wanna hear an upright bass. But if I was to play\njazz on an electric bass, I might even kind of like palm mute. Like, instead of going like\n(mellow bass music playing), I might go (light bass\nmusic playing) to there. Anything to kind of make the notes shorter and less resonant and like\nkind of fade away quick 'cause the upright does that naturally. And I have like a different bass, like a hollow body harmony that sounds closer to an upright that I'll use in certain, like on my song \"Under\nthe Sun\" that I put out, that was on a harmony bass. And it has like kind\nof an upright acoustic kind of tone to it, but with more sustain. - [Lex] And is jazz fusion the style where you have like an electric base? Can you educate me with the jazz fusion? - Again, you can have both. You can have both on... You can have either on anything. There's no like real rules. - Now, I've heard you say\nsomething interesting, which is, well, a lot of\nthings you say is interesting, but-\n- Just one thing. - Just one that- - [Tal] And it's what time you're leaving. - What time was that again? - (laughs) Three minutes. - That it's maybe easier sometimes to define a musical genre\nby the don'ts than the dos, the don'ts than the dos. What are the don'ts of jazz and rock? What are the don'ts of jazz usually? What are the don'ts\nand any domain of life? What are the don'ts? - The don'ts is just to please\nleave your fear at the door. And your dos is to be open to anything and open your ears. Like, respond to what's happening now. I think that quote you're talking about might have been more about an individual\nmusician's unique sound because everyone has their sound. If they've developed their voice and they've listened to their\nown aesthetic preferences, of which everyone is slightly different, everyone has slightly\ndifferent likes and dislikes, then you'll have a unique\nsound on your instrument. And your unique sound is defined more by the choices you make rather than, I mean it's equally as defined by the choices you make and\nthe choices you don't make. I mean, it's the flip side\nof the same coin really. - Yeah, there's certain musicians you can just tell it's them just, you hear a few notes and you're\nlike, oh, okay, it's them. Tone, sometimes it's tone. Sometimes it's the way they play rhythm. - Yeah. It might, that quote you're talking about might have even had to do with someone's like real limitations on an instrument that\nthen that would define their sound is the things that they can't, like actually can't do versus like what you're choosing to do\nversus not choosing to do, which is that like flip\nside of the same coin thing. - How many fingers you play with? It seems like a lot of\nthe greatest musicians aren't technically like perfect. The imperfections is the\nthing that makes them unique and where a lot of the\ncreativity comes from. I mean, Hendrix, Hendrix\nhad a lot of those things, the way he put like a thumb over the top. - Well, his hands were huge.\n- Yeah. - There was no other\nplace for the thumb to go. And it was great that he could reach the E string and that was an advantage. - And he was a lefty playing\na right handed guitar. - [Tal] Yeah, yeah. - Flipped, I guess.\n- Yeah. - That's weird. That probably doesn't\nhave much of an effect. Maybe a spiritual one, I don't know. - Actually flipping a guitar is different. It does bring out\nsomething different in you 'cause I've done it, like\nflipped it and it's like, oh wow. Yeah, really, it's really different. I remember talking to my\nlike osteopath about like, 'cause there's so much\nweight on this shoulder while I'm playing all the time and they were saying like, \"Well, just after shows, just literally just turn it upside down and do the exact same\nthing in the opposite way. It'll like even out your body.\" And I was like, \"Oh, that's good advice.\" - Have you actually tried it? - Mm hm.\n- Okay. All right. I'll write that down. (both chuckling) All right, well, do you\nknow a guy named Davie504?"

      "text": "- [Tal] I've heard of him. - I've recently learned of him. He's a YouTuber and a bass player. He's amazing.\n- Cool. - He combines memes and also just these brilliant bass compositions\nand says slap like a lot. He's big into slapping. - Yeah.\n- That's how, he's the one that kind of made\nme realize this is a thing. Okay. And he also said that\nyou're one of the best, if not the best bassists in the world. There was a bunch of his fans that rode in and he analyzed the Jeff Beck thing that\nwe watched at Crossroads is one of the greatest\nsolos ever, bass solos ever. So, shout out to him. What does that make you feel like? You're the greatest of all time? - Chocolate cookies. - Chocolate, is that your favorite? - I like macadamia nut. Like, if you really wanna get into it with like white chocolate. - Yeah. That's a rare one for people\nto say is the favorite. - Chocolate chip is just like easy. You can kinda get them anywhere. - Yeah. Last thing you wanna be\nis easy in this world. You don't wanna be easy. You said that, \"I love\nrock and roll,\" quote. \"I love folk, I love jazz, I love Indian, classical music. I really love all kinds of music as long as it's authentic\nand from the heart.\" So when you play rock versus jazz, you play all kinds of music. What's the difference technically, musically, spiritually for you? - Well, there's no spiritual difference. - [Lex] Okay, all right. Cross that off the list. - But well, musically,\nyeah, it's kind of like what was saying earlier. It's like each genre has its language of what makes it that genre. And that would be a good thing to say, it's defined by the do's and don'ts because yeah, it's like,\nI'm trying to think. Basically I put the song first and I think of the song as the melody, the lyrics and then the harmony\nand obviously the groove. - So, the song goes before\nthe genre in a sense, each song is like its own thing. - They're both things\nthat are held in my mind. It's like, okay, genre and then song, which is comprised of\nthose basic elements. And I tend to kind of prioritize lyric because somebody is trying to\nexpress something over music. And so that the lyric\nis very, very important. And so, then the choices come from there. It's like, okay, within the genre of X, this is the typical language. And then how do I best serve this lyric? And then where else can I pull from that might not be in these two bags that would put a little twist on it? So, those are all the kinds of things I might be thinking about but I don't like twists for\nthe sake of twists either. I like twists because I wanna hear something that might be fresh. But when someone does\nsomething just to be hip, it's annoying to me. I think you can hear the difference. It's like when people, like they write in odd time signatures or like they write all these riffs just because they can, just 'cause they have the chops to do it or they know how to play\nan 1116 and whatever. Just like, but if it's\nnot actually creating a piece of music that's\ngoing to move somebody, then why are you doing it? And so, I think a lot of the questions I'm asking myself when I'm approaching a song are mainly\nphilosophical and aesthetic. - So, you like to stand\non the edge of the cliff, not for the thrill of it, but 'cause that's where\nyou find something new? - Yeah, yeah.\n- Potentially? - And it's thrilling. - But you're not doing\nit just for the thrill. - I'm not doing it for the thrill. It just happens to be thrilling. - All right. - Because you can always reel it back in. - Can you, though?\n- Yeah, you can. - No.\n- You can like, do a totally like disciplined, like I can go into a session and okay,"

      "text": "my favorite thing about\ngoing into a session with musicians that I adore\nis that we don't hear the demo 'cause if you hear a demo, you're hearing what the producer or songwriter have already imagined that every instrument is playing. And then it's like, well, I've\nalready heard what you want. Now my mind is, part of my mind is focused on what I already know you want and what the destination's gonna be. Why did you bring me in here? I wanna not hear it. I just want you to sit at a piano and sing the song with the, I wanna hear the chords and the lyric or sit\nin an acoustic guitar, play it and then let's all go\nin the room and then take one, I would say 80% of the time\ntake one has the most gold. And there might be like a mistake or two or someone forgot to go to the B section and you might wanna like punch that in so that you're hitting the right chord. But all the magic is in that take. And then sometimes it happens\nwhere it's like you go, it's like we're rehearsing and take one, two, three, four, five. And then you're like\nthinking about it too much and then you go and you have a dinner and you come back and the next take one after dinner is the one. Like, it's usually after\nthere's some sort of a break, but obviously there's\nexceptions to that rule. Sometimes it's take two and three. - Yeah, you said that this is something that surprised you about recording with Prince is that he would just, so much of it would be take one, it would just move so quickly. - Yeah, well, with that particular album that we made together, it's\ncalled \"Welcome to America,\" he called me up and asked me, he said, \"I wanna make a band with you. I'm like really inspired by what you are doing with Jeff Beck. I wanna make a trio. Do you like the drum\nrolls of Jack DeJohnette,\" was like his first question to me. I'm like, \"Well, yeah, who doesn't? Who doesn't like Jack DeJohnette?\" Like one of the greatest of all time. And he's like, \"Well, sounds like,\" 'cause we had a discussion about drumming, \"Sounds like you're kind of\nparticular about drummers, so why don't you find us the drummer and I'll trust you to find the drummer. You can audition some people, send me some recordings and\nmaybe your two favorites and I'll pick out of\nthe two or something.\" So I did that. Went on a journey, found a couple guys. He picked the one, we\nwent in and he basically just would be like, \"Okay, so the A section's\ngonna go like this and then the B section, I think we're gonna go to G, and duh duh. And then the bridge,\nI might go to be flat, but maybe I'll hold off and dah, dah, dah. Okay, let's go. One, two, three, four.\"\n- Wow. - And then we recorded it, two tape. There was no punch. He did not want me to punch anything. Like it was like, and\nthere was one song called \"Same Page, Different Book.\" And he like, talked through\nit just like he did. And then he had me soloing between each phrase, like little fills. It's like, I didn't know that that was gonna come up and he loved that. He loved to have me on\nthe edge of my seat, like falling off the cliff. That was my first like real, like falling off a cliff\nmoment from somebody else holding me at the edge of the cliff. You know what I mean? Now I just do it on my own 'cause it's so, it's so fun and it makes sense. It's the best thing for the music. - When you say punch the tape, is that when you actually record it? - Like, if you record the tape and there's like say\nlike you hit a bum note, like to punch in means\nto like fix that note, like re-record over that one little area and punch that note in. He didn't want that. He like, he's like,\n\"Well, my favorite record is just like, whatever happened happened. That's that moment in time. Let's make a new moment in time.\" It's great. Nobody makes records like that anymore. Everyone wants to like edit and edit and re-record and this and that. And unfortunately with a lot of music, and I'm not saying all music 'cause there's plenty of\ngreat music coming out, but there's the danger of it being flat because every little imperfection\nis digitally removed. - Well, that's one of the promising things about AI is because it can be so perfect that the thing will actually come back to and value about music is the imperfections\nthat humans can create. - [Tal] Yeah. - There'll be a greater\nvaluation of imperfections. - Yeah. - I mean, you can kind of\nprogram imperfections too. - Yeah, sure. That's also very sad. But then you get closer and closer to what it means to be human. And maybe there'll be AI's among us, they'll be human flawed\nlike the rest of us. Mortal and silly at times (sighs). - (laughs) Another big sigh. - (chuckles) Is it fair to say that you're very melodic on bass? Like you, you make the bass sing more than people normally do? - Is that a compliment? - Yes, I think so. - Thank you. - Moving on to the next\nquestion (chuckles). As by way of understanding, it's just there's something about the way you play bass that just kind of pulls you in the way, when you listen to somebody play a guitar, like a guitar solo. - The thing I love about Jeff Beck is that he played the\nguitar like a singer. And I think that the way that Wayne Shorter played his\nsaxophone, it's like a singer. And I think everyone, every musician aspires to\njust sound like a singer. - So you make it sing."

Like, I hear the influence, it's funny. - Just from your musician perspective, what's interesting to you about, what really stands out\nto you about Hendrix? I just would love to hear like a real professional\nmusician's opinion of Hendrix. - I love that he is two voices\ncombined into one voice. So it's like, there is\nhis voice on the guitar and there is his singing voice, and there is the combination\nof the two that make one voice. And of course, the third\nelement is his songwriting and all of this have\nthis beautiful chemistry and all work geniously perfectly together, and there's nothing like it. And he always beat himself\nup about being a singer and like, he didn't like his voice. But it's like, my favorite\nsingers are the singers that don't sound like singers. - Bob Dylan. You said you like Bob Dylan.\n- Bob Dylan. I love Bob Dylan. - You love his voice too.\n- I love his voice. - Can you explain your love affair with Bob Dylan's voice? - He's expressing his lyrics. It's just pure expression. Exactly what he means. I feel everything that he's saying with 100% authenticity. - Yeah.\n- That's what I wanna hear from a singer. I don't care how many runs you\ncan do and blah, blah, blah. Like, I wanna believe what you're saying. - Leonard Cohen is that.\n- Mm hm. There's countless, like Neil Young.

      "section": "Mentorship",
      "text": "- Let me ask you about mentorship. You said teachers and mentors. You had mentors. What's a good mentor for you? Harsh or supportive? - Supportive. - Supportive. You seen \"Whiplash\" the movie? So that guy, somebody screaming at you, like kicking you off the cliff. - Not necessary. I feel like anybody\nthat's truly passionate about something that\nthey wanna be great at or a master of or this and that, they've already got that\nperson inside their own head. You don't need somebody\nelse to do that for you. I think you need love, acceptance,\nguidance, support, time, advice if you ask for it. Just a space, just a nice open space. All my mentors were just that for me, they didn't tell me to do anything. They don't care. Like, because they're not, why do they need to be\ninvested in where I'm going? Only I know where I'm going. So, for some mentor to come and be like, this is what you need to\nbe doing and practice it. It's like, but why? What if that's not my path? That might be your path. So I'm not really, again,\notherwise it feels like a sport. Like, who can run the fastest race? And it's like, well, okay, well, I get that for that, for sport. Maybe it makes sense to have someone a bit more hardcore. But still, like I would say athletes have the same mentality. They've got that in them already, too. Like, so I think more like of a strategic approach to\nmentorship works really well. And mainly just having an open space and just being available to someone. - And kind of show that\nthey see the special in you. - Yeah, yeah.\n- And they give you the room to develop\nthat special whatever. - Exactly, because if you do have that harsh critic inside you, it's like, it is nice to have somebody that isn't like your family or someone that's not obligated any way that just sees your\ntalent and they're like, \"Yeah, I dig what you're doing. Keep doin' it.\" - Yeah, it's funny that that's\nnot always easy to come by. - Do you have any mentors? - Yeah, I've had a few recently, but for most of my life\npeople didn't really, I'm very much like that too. Like somebody to pat me\non the back and say like, like see something in you of value. Yeah, I didn't really have that. So. - Do you wish you did? - Yeah, yeah, but maybe\nthe wishing that I did is the thing that made me who I am, not having it, the longing for that, maybe that's the thing\nthat helped me develop a constant sense of longing, which I think is a way of, because I have that engine in me, it really allows me to deeply appreciate every single moment, every single, everything that's given to me. So like, just a eternal gratitude. So, you never know which are the bad parts and the good parts. So, if you remove one thing, it might be, the whole thing might collapse. I suppose I'm grateful\nfor the whole thing. That one note you screwed\nup so many years ago, that might've been essential. - What about because you do jiu-jitsu? - Yes. So like-\n- Do you? Are you-\n- I don't, my dad does. - Oh, yeah? - My dad's super into it. I love my dad. He's the coolest. But no, I don't do it. He's a blue belt right now. - Nice, nice.\n- Great. - You ever been on the mat with him, like- - Not yet, but I plan on it. - You should do it.\n- What belt are you? - Black belt.\n- Sick. Do you wanna go on that? - Yeah, right. You got the shit talking\npart of jujitsu down. You have to do the technique. - But like for that, like for instance, like do you need a harsh\nmentor or teacher or- - Yeah, but you like, you\nsaid it really beautifully. Like, to me, I agree, there's a difference\nbetween sport and art. - Yeah.\n- They overlap. There's, for sure, but there's something about sport where like perfection is actually like perfection, perfection is really the thing you really wanna get to, the technical perfection. With art it feels like\ntechnical perfection is almost a way to get lost on the path to wherever something unique. So, but yeah, with sport, I definitely, and one of the kind of athletes that loves to have like\na dictatorial coach. - Yeah.\n- Somebody that like helps me really push myself to the limit. - But you are the one\nthat's kind of dictating how hard you're getting pushed in a way. Like you're choosing your mentor. Like that \"Whiplash\" video is like, he didn't ask for that. - In a way he might've. - Well, maybe, maybe subconsciously. - I mean there is-\n- Or it's a movie, so... (both laughing) - Next you're gonna tell\nme they're just actors. I mean, and but yeah,\nhow do we choose things? You don't always choose, but you're kind of maybe\nsubconsciously choose. And some of it, like some of\nthe great Olympic athletes I've interacted with their parents for many years would force\n'em to go to practice until they discovered\nthe beauty of the thing that they were doing\nand then they loved it. So like, at which point does something that looks like abuse become like a gift? It's weird (laughs). It's all very weird. But for you, support and\nspace to discover the thing, the voice, the music within you. - Yeah, it's my personal choice because I'm very familiar\nwith the inner critic and I can bring her out at any point. I don't need help with that. - Oh, so you do have-\n- Yeah. - She's on call.\n- She was on overdrive. That's why now I had to\nwork on that so much. - Yeah, you have a really\nhappy way about you right now. - Thanks. - You're very zen."

      "text": "Can I ask you about Bruce Springsteen? - Yeah, sure. - A lot of songs of his I listen to make me feel this melancholy feeling. It's not just Bruce Springsteen,\nbut Bruce does a lot. What is that about songs that arouse a kind of sad feeling or a\nlonging feeling, or a feeling? What is that? What is that about us humans on the receiving end of the music? - Each frequency does\nelicit a different kind of emotional response. That is real, scientific. - [Lex] You mean like on\nthe physics aspect of it? - Yeah, yeah, the physical level. So, there is that combined with the right kind of lyric and the right kind of\nmelody of the right kind of chord will elicit the very\nparticular kind of emotion. And it is scientific, it can be analyzed. I don't particularly want to analyze it because I don't want to approach things with that in advance. I don't want it to inform where I'm going. I like the feeling to lead me naturally to where I'm writing. But yeah, there's a real\nchemical element to that. And then also, like I was\nsaying, like the lyric, what it means to you, which poetry is supposed to mean something to everybody, like different. It's not supposed to mean one thing. Like you can't analyze and be like, this is what this poet meant. And like we were talking\nabout with Leonard earlier, it's like the broader\nyou can leave a lyric, the better you can appeal to people in so many different ways. And even to the songwriter, like I'll sing some of my\nsongs from five years ago and I'll be like, oh, I didn't even think that it could have meant\nthat, but I guess it does. That's funny. I like just giggle on stage suddenly 'cause a lyric will hit me differently from a different new\nexperience or something. - Have you ever cried listening to a song? - Of course. Weep like a baby in a bathtub. - Which (laughs)? Who's the regular go-to then? Leonard?\n- Leonard. - Leonard, yeah. \"Hallelujah\" is is a\nsong that consistently makes me feel somethin'. - It's holy, his work is holy. And if you were in his presence, I guess there was a lot to that being. - What advice would\nyou give to young folks on how to have a life\nthey can be proud of? - Hm. Just tackle the demons\nas early as possible, whether it's through your\nart or through meditation or through whatever it means, diaries, whatever it is. Just walk towards the\nthings that are scary. - Hm. - Because if you don't,\nthey'll just expand. They become bigger. If you avoid the demons,\nthey become bigger. - What does that mean for you today? Are you still missing Jeff? - I'll always miss Jeff, but I don't feel like a\npiece of me is missing. And same with Leonard. It's that I did give\nthem a piece of myself and maybe they gave me a piece of them that I hold with me and I cherish, but it doesn't feel like I'm less than or they're less than, or anything's less than. Just, you learn to\nappreciate the impermanence of everything in life. Impermanence of everything except for, consciousness I guess you could say is the only thing that is permanent. So, everything else\nyou learn to appreciate that impermanence because\nthe limited amount of time it like in this\nparticular body is, it's enticing. Kind of gives you like a\ntime limit, which is cool. I like that. - [Lex] So you've come to accept your own? - Yeah. Like it's cool that I'm like, okay, I got maybe this amount\nof time, who knows? But if I was-\n- It could end today. - Yeah, if I died today, I'd be really happy with my life. - Okay.\n- It's not like I'm like, oh, I missed out on this and that. - So you really wanna\nmake sure that every day could be your last day and\nyou're happy with that. - I've always lived that way, yeah. I felt this way since I\nwas in my early twenties. I'd be like, yeah, I\ncould die today, sure. I don't wanna die, I\nhave no reason to die. But if I did, I know\nthat I put my everything, all my effort and all my passion and all my love into\nwhatever I've already done. So if my time's up then my time's up. - What role does love\nplay in this whole thing, in the human condition? - Well, love is everything. I mean, if you define love,\nif you're talking about love as in romantic love or\npaternal or maternal love, or if you're talking about love as in an eastern tradition\nlike Vedanta for instance, love is consciousness, love is everything. - That's the only permanent thing. - Yeah. Or if you were to go come from a zen or like a Buddhist perspective,\nthey would say nothingness. Like emptiness is versus fullness. - Well, those guys are really obsessed with the whole suffering\nthing, and letting go of it. - [Tal] Yeah. - Well, I was wondering if you would"

  "full_text": "- I am standing on the edge\nof the cliff the entire night, and if I mess something up, mess it up, like, what even is a mistake? But if I do like a little clunker or whatever it is, it's like, so what? Like, I wouldn't have played\nhalf the stuff that I'm playing if I wasn't constantly standing on the edge of the cliff, like wild. - Why you stand on the edge of the cliff? - Because at the edge of the\ncliff is all possibilities. (air whooshing) - The following is a\nconversation with Tal Wilkenfeld, a singer-songwriter, bassist, guitarist, and a true musician who has recorded and performed with many legendary artists, including Jeff Beck, Prince,\nEric Clapton, Incubus, Herbie Hancock, Mick Jagger,\nJackson Browne, Rod Stewart, David Gilmour, Pharrell, Hans\nZimmer, and many, many more. This was a fun and\nfascinating conversation. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Tal Wilkenfeld. There's a legendary video of\nyou playing with Jeff Beck. We're actually watching\nit in the background now. So for people who don't know, Jeff is one of the\ngreatest guitarists ever. So you're playing with him at\nthe 2007 Crossroads Festival, and people should\ndefinitely watch that video. You were killing it on\nthe bass (chuckles). Look at that face (laughs). Were you scared? What was that experience like? Were you nervous? You don't look nervous. - Yeah.\n- You look confident. - Yeah, I wasn't nervous. I think that you can\nget an adrenaline rush before a stage, which is natural, but I think as soon as you\nbring fear to a bandstand, you're like limiting yourself. You're kind of like walling yourself off from everyone else. If you're afraid, like what\nis there to be afraid of? That you must be afraid\nof making a mistake and therefore you're coming at it as like a perfectionist and you can't come at music that way, or it's not gonna be as expansive\nand vulnerable and true. So, no, I was excited and passionate and having the best time. And also, the fact that\nhe gave me this solo, the context of this performance is that this was a guitar festival. It's one of the biggest\nguitar festivals in the world 'cause it's Eric Clapton's festival, and there's like 400 guitarists that are all playing like solos all night. And we were like, towards\nthe end of the night, and I could tell like Jeff,\nlike got like a kick out of, \"I'm not gonna solo on like one of my most well-known songs.\" \"'Cause We've Ended As Lovers.\" Well, Stevie Wonder wrote it, but people know Jeff for\nthat song and his solo on it. It's like, \"I'm gonna give\nit to my bass player.\" And like, and he did and like- - He took it.\n- The fact that he's like bowing. Like, that... Like, he didn't have to do that, so- - But you really stepped up there. - It just shows what a\ngenerous musician he is and that's evident in his\nplaying across the board is he is a generous,\nloving, open musician. He's not there for himself. He's there for the music. And he thought, \"Well, this would be the\nperfect musical thing to do.\" And it kind of all started, like, when I went to audition for him, which was an interesting experience because I got food poisoning on the plane. And so like, literally\nwhen the plane landed, I went straight into an ambulance\ninto a hospital overnight. The manager picked me up and I showed up at Jeff's door, which is like a three hour drive, like through windy country roads. And he answered the door and he's like, \"Okay, you ready to play (laughs)?\" So we went upstairs and started\nlike rattling off the set. And when it came to this song, \"'Cause We've Ended as Lovers,\" he just said solo and he loved\nit and kept the solo in it. So that's kind of how, 'cause\nthat there was no bass solo before I was playing in his band. So, this whole thing was kind of new. - So even with food poisoning,\nlike you could step up? - Yeah (laughs). - That's just like what, instinct? - It's just being able to differentiate from like the body and from\nlike expression, music. - All right.\n- Yeah. - It's interesting, you said fear walls you off from the other musicians. And what are you afraid of? You're afraid of making a mistake? Beethoven said, \"To play a\nwrong note is insignificant. To play without passion is inexcusable.\" - [Tal] Yeah. - Do you think the old man had a point? - Yeah. Different styles of music\ninvite varying degrees of, I would say uncertainty or unsafety in the way that people might perceive it. So for instance, like the\ntour that I was just on, like playing Allman Brothers songs, like I am standing on\nthe edge of the cliff the entire night and\nif I mess something up, mess it up, like, what even is a mistake? But if I do like a little clunker or whatever it is, it's like, so what? Like, I wouldn't have\nplayed half the stuff that I'm playing if I\nwasn't constantly standing on the edge of the cliff, like wild. And so, I don't care about\nthose few little things. I care about the overall expression. And then there's other\ngigs that for instance, if I got called for like a pop or a country session or a show that in those environments\nthey may want you to play safe. Like just play the part and play it with a great groove and\ntime and great dynamics and don't really veer away\nfrom the part and stuff and I've done plenty of those gigs too. It's just, it's just a\ndifferent, like hat you put on. - What do you get from the veering? From the veering off the beaten path? You just love it? Or is that gonna make\nthe performance better? Like why you stand at\nthe edge of the cliff? - Because at the edge of the cliff is all possibilities and unknown. You don't know what's coming. And I love being there in the unknown. Otherwise it's just like,\nwell, why are we doing this? Am I just like a clown on stage, like showing you my skills or what I've studied in my bedroom? It's like, no. Like, I wanna be like pure expression happening right now and\nresponding in real time to everything that's happening. And anytime I'm not doing that, it's like, it's a waste of everybody's time. - Have you ever messed it up real bad? - Mess what up? - (chuckles) I mean,\nyou know comedians bomb. You're a big fan of comedy.\n- Yeah. - Have you ever bombed on stage? - Probably. I think it's all about recovery, and the more times that\nyou fall off the cliff the quicker you know how to recover and the the varying ways that you can recover to the point in which it's concealed so much that maybe a listener might not even know that you're recovering. - And eventually you learn to fly if we take that metaphor all the way off the cliff, you learn. All right. - I remember one time\nwhen I was really young, well, not really young, but like when I was 21 or 22.\n- What is 18? - Yeah, exactly. But when I was first\nplaying with Jeff Beck and we played at what I consider the best, the coolest jazz festival. It's Montreux Jazz, and\nlike Miles played there, everyone played there and they have the best speaker system ever. I was excited for months and the drummer Vinny was like practicing for like eight hours in\nthe bus on the way there. And everyone was like on fire on stage. And I remember playing a note, just one note that I really didn't like and I let it go in the moment on stage, but as soon as I got off\nstage, I was really sad. And so I sat like on this road case, everyone was out celebrating, I like sat this road case\nwith a sad face like boo-hoo. And then Claude Nobs, like the owner of the whole\nfestival came out to me. He's like, \"Tal, what's wrong?\" And I'm like, \"I played\na bad note (laughs).\" I was such a child. And like, he said all this wise stuff that Miles Davis had imparted to him and like it fully cheered me up. He's like, is there anything that would make you feel better? And I was like, caviar. (both laughing) The dude came back 10 minutes\nlater with this huge thing. - Oh wow.\n- It was a joke, it was a joke but he actually\nbrought me caviar, the guy. But anyway, that's the one time that I remember being\nsad about a performance. Now I'm just like, okay, whatever. Like, it's done. - Was it a physical slip of\nlike the fingers or was it, did you intend to play that note? - That I can't remember. I can't remember if it\nwas just a bad choice that sounded like a\nclanger or why it happened. It was so long ago. But I don't get depressed\nabout that anymore. - That'd be funny if that\nwas like your biggest and only regret in life is that note and that haunted you in your dreams. - And then like I'm on\nmy deathbed and just, everyone's just bringing me caviar because of the one (laughs)... - Joke went way too far. You talked about confidence somewhere. I don't remember where. So I want to ask you about how much confidence it\ntakes to be up there. You said something that\nAnthony Jackson told you as encouragement. A line that I really like that quote, \"On your worst day, you're\nstill a bad mother fucker.\" - That's actually a Steve Gadd quote and Steve used to tell that to Anthony 'cause Anthony used to get real depressed if he did a wrong thing\nor not perfect thing. And Steve Gadd used to say\nthis to Anthony Jackson, and then Anthony was my first bass mentor, or just mentor in general. - For people who don't know\nhe's a legendary bassist. - He's a legendary bassist. And I started playing\nthe bass when I was 17 and I moved to New York and I met Anthony and he started mentoring me\nbit in a very not typical way. Like, he like would just sit in his car with me for hours and talk music, and- - You guys just listen\nto music and analyze it? - Exactly. And that was the best\nform of learning, I think. Just like, \"Well, what\ndo you perceive here?\" And \"Well, I heard this,\"\nand just discussing that. - Jazz usually, or?\n- No, all styles of music. And yeah, he told me that story\nabout \"On your worst day,\" because like, yeah, even then, like when I was like 18, 19, I'd get sad sometimes about performances. Like, I could have done this. It's like, I don't do\nthat anymore, thankfully, or I'd be miserable. - So you still, you always\nkind of feel pretty good. - Yeah. Yeah, now I do. Now, it's just I sense\nthe body feeling fatigued. Especially if it's a very long show. Like the ones I just did\nwere three hour shows and we did one to three hour sound checks. So that's a lot of physical\nactivity every day. So I just feel the body being tired, like fatigued, the ears are fatigued. That's about it. I don't really reflect on the show much. - You're almost like from\na third person perspective, feel the body get tired\nand just accept it. - Yeah. I don't wanna identify with it 'cause then I'm like, then\nI'm tired, but I'm not tired. - It's very zen.\n- I'm usually like energized. - It's like with the food poisoning, the mind is still capable\nof creative genius even if the body is gone.\n- Yeah (laughs). - Something like that? - [Tal] Yeah. - So no self-critical component to the way you see your performances anymore? - There is critique, but not in the way that it\nwould diminish my sense of self. It's different.\n- Sure. - I can just kind of look\nat something and be like, \"Okay, well actually next time I'll do this choice and this choice maybe, maybe this would serve the song better. Maybe this would help the\ngroove feel more like this.\" But it's not like, \"I\nsuck because I did this and I'm a loser,\" and like- - Do you think that's bad? Because even when I asked that question, I had a self-critical thought that \"Why'd you ask that question? That's the wrong question.\" I always have the\nself-critical engine running. Is it necessarily a bad thing? - It depends if it's\naffecting you negatively. - What is negative anyway? - Well, if it brings your frequency down and you feel less joyful inside and less you don't feel like complete, you feel less than, less\nworthy of something, than you could call that bad if you aspire to not feel that way. - Yeah, I aspire to not feel\nthat way in the big picture. But in the little picture, like there's, a little pain is good. - That's fair. - So confidence, you seem\nlike in this performance you seem confident. You seem to be truly walking the bad mother fucker way of life. - (chuckles) I kind of,\na word that I prefer over confidence is trust. Because I think with\nconfidence is almost like there's a belief assigned\nto it that I am this thing that you believe in.\n- Yeah, ego. - Whereas trust is just simply knowing that you can get up there and handle whatever is\ngonna come your way. And it's more of an open feeling where it's like, yeah,\nI could do this, sure. But not like, \"I'm a bad mother fucker.\" Like, you know what I mean? There's a huge difference\n'cause I've shared the stage with people who\nhave a lot of confidence and it can be like a brick wall, just like fear is a brick wall. - So, the brick wall is a bad thing? Like the thing you have\nwith Jeff here on stage- - Is not a brick wall.\n- There's no wall. - No.\n- There's chemistry. - [Tal] Yeah. - How can you explain that\nchemistry the two of you had? - Trust and lack of fear, yeah. And also I will say that each individual has developed likes and\ndislikes over their lifetime. And that can be like, in this case we're just talking aesthetic likes and dislikes. So, in this particular case, obviously our likes and dislikes are very much aligned such that the things I do to compliment him,\nhe enjoys and vice versa. But it could be two very\ntrusting open musicians on stage that don't have walls up, but their choices are very different and one person likes heavy metal and the other person likes classical. - Yeah.\n- So, it's gotta be both. - So you guys were good at like yes anding each other musically like- - Definitely. - Is that where you're most at peace in a meditative way is on stage? - It used to be that it\nwould only be on stage. It started with that. That was almost like\nmy way in to flow state and meditation was playing music. And then back in the day when\nI'd kind of crash after shows, I wanted to change that. I wanted to always feel\nlike I'm in flow state. So-\n- Have you succeeded? - I've gotten a lot better. I'm still obviously on\nthe journey, but yes. - So you meditate, I\nthink you said somewhere that you meditate before\nshows or just in general? - I meditate every day. When I'm on tour with my band, I ask that we all meditate\ntogether for at least 20 minutes. And I don't dictate\nwhich type of meditation, I don't put on a guided meditation 'cause everyone has their\nown thing they wanna do. Maybe someone might be\npraying in their head, it doesn't matter. It's just the idea that\nwe all put our phones down and we all are in one room\nconnecting energetically, spiritually, and just letting our lives go for a second and then we\nwalk straight on the stage and it's always really connected. And there were a couple gigs where we ran out of time for that. And I could tell. There was a major difference\nin the performance. - So, it both connects\nyou and centers you, all of those things? - Yeah, but then when I'm home, like I love to meditate and I've tried various\nstyles of meditation and studied various types of things. So, I don't do just one thing. I kind of customize it depending\non where I'm at in my life. - You and the world lost\nJeff Beck a year ago. You told me you really miss him. How's the pain of losing Jeff change you? Maybe deepen your sense of the world? - Hm. It's hard to accept that we won't create something musically\nagain in this lifetime. But in terms of the grief, grief was easier for me because I went through\na major grief period in 2016 and 17, and that was the first\ntime I'd really gone through the process of grief in a, like in a non-family situation. Like with friends and mentors and people that I'd created\nwith, which is different. It's a different kind of connection. When my grandparents died, it's like there was nothing left unsaid and I was at peace with\nwhat was happening. With this when Prince died\nout of the blue in mid 2016, and then Leonard Cohen died in November, that just tore me to shreds because Leonard Cohen was not just someone that profoundly inspired\nme musically and lyrically, but spiritually we had\na very deep connection. And that was the basis of a lot of our conversation\nwas spirituality. And so, at that time I felt\nlike a piece of me went missing. And that was a very long process where I just stayed in my place and didn't wanna play a note of music. I kind of wanted to just\nget rid of all my stuff. So, I had a friend come\nover and he's like, \"You should just, why don't\nyou come to The Comedy Store?\" I'm like, \"Comedy store? Like, what am I gonna go to some store and buy clown suits? Like, what are you talking about? What's a comedy store?\"\n- Yeah. - He's like, \"No, no, no. Like, The Comedy Store. The place where like comedians go.\" I'm like, okay, well,\nI've never seen standup. I don't, I've seen \"Seinfeld\" on TV. That's like the extent\nof my standup experience. So he took me to The Comedy Store and every single one of those comedians like embraced me like I was family. It didn't even take a day. I was like part of the family and I made like 25 best friends. And I ended up throwing\nall my stuff in storage and like finding a little room to stay in where I rented my gear out. And that was me, my rent\npaying was me loaning the gear 'cause I didn't want any\nresponsibilities, financial, I just wanted to be completely free so that I could like just process it and not feel like I had to commit to anything work-wise or creatively. I just wanted to unplug. And so this was like a fun and\nvery different way to unplug because previously I may have just gone to a monastery and spent weeks\nat a monastery or months. But in this case I was\nlike, you know what? This is a different kind of experience. I'm gonna just hang out with comedians and stay in this room and- - [Lex] With no responsibility really. - Yeah, other than to\nreally deeply connect with this grief that I'm experiencing. I'm not going to negate it. I'm gonna really fully connect to it, and I did and it was tough. And then more people in 2017 were leaving, Greg Armand, Tom Petty. I mean, it was like, these\nare people that I worked with all these people and\nlike had great connections with them and they were all going and the world was mourning the loss of these people because of everything that they'd given to the world. Like they'd changed the world's lives, not just mine 'cause\nI knew 'em personally. And so, that was also complicated. And why, for me it was interesting to be grieving the loss of\nthese musicians with comedians. And I learned a lot. It changed my life 'cause I just learned to laugh at absolutely anything. Everything. I mean, my grandpa had a really\ngreat sense of humor too. My grandpa as a Holocaust survivor, and like he could just kinda\nlike, laugh at anything. And like, so I already\nkind of have that in me. But being around all these comedians just kinda like exaggerated that for me, and that really changed\nthings for me for the better. So then when Jeff Beck\ndied, it was like, okay, I've got these tools, I know what this is and I'm gonna go through it again and I'm gonna be on tour\nwith Incubus in two days. - [Lex] Yeah. - And so Mike Dirnt from Green Day, he called me up and he said, \"Hey, like I know you're\ngoing through a lot.\" And I said, \"Yeah, I don't\neven know what I'm gonna play. Like, I really wanna\nvintage jazz bass for this and I only have a 70s one that I don't really think is appropriate. I really need a 60s one.\" Blah, blah, blah. And Mike's like, \"I'm gonna hook you up.\" He showed up to my place the next day with a truckload of old\np basses and jazz bases and brought them all into my\nstudio and I'm playing them. And then I pull one out of the case and it's an Olympic White, just like Jeff Beck, and I play it. And not only did I get\ngoosebumps and started crying, but I looked over at Mike and same thing was happening and he's like, \"Uh, I guess Jeff might\nmight be happy about this.\" And he's like, \"Well, I\ndidn't wanna let this one go. I was just trying to cheer you up a bit and maybe loan it to you for the tour, but if you really want it, it's yours.\" And I was like, \"Oh my God. This is like, like Mike Dirnt\nis the nicest guy ever.\" So, that happened. So that bass's name is\nJeff and it's a white Jeff and I played it on the Incubus tour. But yeah, I do feel like I'm more equipped to handle grief now. - Tell me about The Comedy\nStore a little bit more. Do you think comedians and musicians in some deep fundamental way\nare made from the same cloth? Like, are they spiritually\nconnected somehow? - I think everyone's connected spiritually in the same way.\n- Yes. - So, I think personality wise, comedians and musicians are\nquite different actually. - In what way? - Well, you'd have to subdivide even musicians into\ndifferent categories too, because the thing that I\nappreciate about comedians is that you go to a restaurant with them and like all the\nobservational humor of like, they'll just, they'll notice everything and make you laugh about it. Which a really great songwriter\ndoes the same thing too. And my favorite lyricists,\nlike Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Warren Zevon, they add comedy into their lyric. And like, so those types\nof people I would liken to hanging out with a comedian. It's very different from like, say somebody that is an\ninstrumental guitarist or something like that\nthey're more focused on whether it's like a kinesthetic thing or like a physical\nthing or whatever it is. They're not quite doing the observational thing in the same way. So, I just appreciate, like, my favorite thing to\ndo is go out and laugh. Especially 'cause like, I can tend to be pretty\nanalytical and be in my head. And so, anything that\njust kind of lets me be in my heart and just enjoy life is great. - I think there's a photo of you with Dave Chappelle on stage. What was that about? - So, right after Leonard\nCohen passed away, The Comedy Store threw\nme a birthday party. It was this crazy lineup and like, it was like, I'd play a song with my band and then Jackson Browne\nsat in and like sung a song and then like Dave Chappelle\ncame up and said some jokes. It was like one of my\nfavorite nights ever. Yeah, it was cool.\n- Yeah. - It was a very healing birthday party. - Yeah, there's something\nmagical about that place. - Yeah.\n- It's really special. - Yeah, well The Mothership\nhas some magic to it, too. - Yeah.\n- It's really cool. It's different, totally different vibe, but like, super awesome. - You said that Leonard Cohen is a songwriting inspiration of yours. I saw you perform the song\n\"Chelsea Hotel\" brilliantly on the internet. It's about, for people who don't know, his love affair with Janet Joplin. How's that song make you feel? - [Tal] Great. I love that song. - Which aspect? Musically, the melancholy feeling, the hopeful feeling, the cocky feeling? All of it. Like every single line has a different feeling to it, really. - Yeah, but as a whole piece,\nI appreciate it so much. I actually lived at the Chelsea Hotel and when Leonard and I first met, that was one of the first\nthings we talked about was that I lived there\nwhere all that stuff went down before they tore it apart. And yeah, it's just a beautiful song. - It makes me sad the way it ends. \"I don't mean to suggest\nthat I loved you the best. I can't keep track of each fallen robin. I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel. That's all. I don't even think of you that often.\" You know that line, \"I don't\neven think of you that often,\" always like breaks my\nheart for some reason. - Hm.\n- Like how ephemeral, how short lasting like\ncertain love affairs can be. Just kinda like, huh. - Yeah.\n- Do you think he meant it? I always think he's trying\nto convince himself of it. - It could be both or either. I mean, that's the\nbeautiful thing about poetry and lyric is that it's\nsupposed to be open. - Yeah. I wonder if it's also open to him depending on the day, you know? - Definitely. I mean, the thing that he taught me or his advice to me was\nwhen you're writing a song, look at it the next morning, like just first thing and\nread it and then take a walk, smoke a joint, read it again. Go have a fight with your daughter, come back, read it again. Get drunk, read it again. Wait a week, read it again. Just so that you know from every state and every position that you, the wider the lens is gonna be\nfrom an audience perspective. You want things to mean multiple things. - So, there's one line I read somewhere that he regrets putting in the song, so I gotta ask you about it. It's pretty edgy. It's about, \"Giving me\nhead on the unmade bed.\" - [Tal] Yeah. - You think that's a\ngood line or bad line? - I think it's an amazing line. It's one of the best lines in the song. - Yeah, right? - When he put that song out, obviously he didn't regret it or he wouldn't have put\nthat lyric in the song. I think what happened was that eventually word\ngot out either from him or from somebody else, that the song was about Janice Joplin. - [Lex] Yes. - And so at that point he\nregretted the indiscretion. So it wasn't that he regretted\nhow great the line was, it was just the privacy factor. But then again, Leonard's\nknown for rewriting his lyrics. In his live shows you'll\nsee a bunch of songs where it's like new lyrics and he didn't do it 'cause he\ndidn't like the old lyrics. He just did it because he could, 'cause he's Leonard and it's like, why not have fun with words the way musicians have fun improvising solos on stage? And he could have changed that line in \"Chelsea Hotel\" after in\nretrospect, and he never did. - \"I remember you well\nin the Chelsea Hotel. You were talking so brave and so sweet, giving me head on the unmade bed while the limousines wait in the street.\" - It's so powerful. - That's a powerful line. It just kind of shocks you. - Well, that's what's so great about it. Yeah.\n- Mm hm. But also heartbreaking\n'cause it doesn't last, especially actually to me it adds more meaning once you\nknow it's Janice Joplin. It's like, okay, these two\nstars kinda collided for a time. - Yeah. But but why is it heartbreaking? It could also be just beautiful that they had a little fling. - Yeah, everything is beautiful. - Thank you. - Even the dark stuff. What's not beautiful? Everything is beautiful if you look long enough and deeply enough. What were we saying?\n(Tal laughs) Oh, what do you think about \"Hallelujah?\" Like, what do you think about the different songs of his and what why'd you choose\n\"Chelsea Hotel\" to perform? - Because I lived there and it was like, it meant something to\nme to sing that song, and actually when I put\nthat song out on YouTube, that's when he sent me an email. He's like, \"Hey, do you\nwanna come over and-\" - Nice. So, this is how you guys connected? - No, we met in a rehearsal studio. I ended up watching their whole rehearsal and sitting there next to Roshi, his like 105 year old monk,\nwhich was really great. I remember when I was\nlike shaking his hand, like, so I like, it was just me and Roshi on the couch watching\nLeonard with this band. And we're shaking hands and he grips my hand like this,\nso like doesn't let it go. And he said, he looked at my\neyes, he said, \"Where are you?\" And I said, \"In the handshake?\" - He's like, \"Yes.\" (both laughing) - Wow, you passed the test. - Passed the Roshi test. And then what's funny\nwas that the next thing that happened about five\nminutes later was Leonard Cohen got down on his knees and opened up a jar, I'm not kidding you of caviar. This is not a callback. - Well it is in a way.\n- I know, I know. - In a deep, fundamental way. - He started feeding the monk caviar. - Yeah.\n- And that healed my Montreux Jazz Festival sadness forever. The end. See you later.\n- Do you think there's a kind of like weird, like there's a sense of\nhumor to it all somehow? Like, why does that happen? Why does that happen? Why, like, why stuff like that happens or that the Jeff bass speaks to you. - Why do we need to know? - You believe in that stuff? - In what stuff? - That there's a rhyme to\nthe whole thing somehow. Like, there's a frequency to which magical things\nof that nature can happen? - I'm divided about that answer because I think just things are flowing. I don't necessarily, I\ndon't think anything's kind of like planned out. - Like through time it's\nlike an orchestra playing of different experiences and circumstances that\nare somehow connected. - I think everything's connected. So, yes. - [Lex] But predetermined means like- - I don't believe in the\npredetermined stuff necessarily, which is different from\nwhatever your previous karma is and karma as a whole other\nkind of conversation. I don't mean karma as in\nlike good karma, bad karma, just karma meaning the collection of things you've acquired over this lifetime or other lifetimes. Just whatever that whatever that is, is going to influence your future. - Uh huh.\n- So- - Well, you had a really interesting trajectory through life. - Mm. - Maybe I just read it that way because I've had a lot of stuff happen to me that's like lucky. Feels lucky. And sometimes I wonder like, huh? Like, this is weird. It does feel like the universe just kinda throws stuff\nat you with a chuckle. I don't know. Not you, the proverbial you.\n- One, one. Yeah. - You said you sometimes\nwatch classic movies to inspire your songwriting and you mentioned watching \"Taxi Driver.\" I love that movie. And I think you mentioned that you wrote a love\nsong based on that movie. So, Travis Bickle for\npeople who don't know is a taxi driver and he's deeply lonely. What do you think about\nthat kind of loneliness? - I think that loneliness is a product of feeling separate from the\nworld and separate from others. And that the less you\nexperience that separation, the less you'll feel lonely. - How often have you\nfelt lonely in this way? Separated from the rest of the world? - It's less and less every single year 'cause I work very hard at it. - Feeling what, a part of the world? - Yeah, just meditating and\nstudying scriptures and- - Don't you think that, I mean, isn't there a\nfundamental loneliness to the human experience? Just-\n- In what sense? - That all the struggles, all the suffering you experience is really experienced by you alone? - Is it? - Maybe at the very bottom it's not. - It's kind of all the same stuff. - You didn't feel alone in 2016, 2017? - I felt like I lost a piece of myself that I had given to somebody else. And I feel like people feel that in romantic exchanges, whether\nit's long term, short term, you give a piece of yourself\nand then if that person dies or you break up with that person, you feel like you've lost\nthat piece of yourself. Which I feel like is\nvery different experience than if you just are opening yourself rather than giving a piece of yourself. You're just opening yourself\nto somebody or something. - So, opening is fundamentally\nnot a lonely experience? - Mm mm, no it's a loving experience. - And then losing a\npiece of yourself can be? - Yeah, 'cause you can't really, you can't lose a piece of yourself if you are the same self\nas every other self. - Right, right. So if you see yourself as\ntogether with everybody, then there's no losing. - Yeah.\n- Yeah, yeah. It's a beautiful way to look at it. You said that there's something healing about being in an empty hotel room with no attachments except your suitcase. A lot of people will talk\nabout hotel rooms being a fundamentally lonely experience. But you're saying it's healing. - It's healing, yeah. 'cause I just get to sit there and not worry about all this stuff that like this, these\nmeaningless attachments. I got my suitcase with my necessities or my three suitcases sometimes (laughs), and I can just sit there and meditate and just be with myself,\nand it's so awesome. And usually like you plan\nyour touring for like, you kind of get the business aspect of things taken care of\nin advance so you can kind of just really be flowing\nday to day on a tour. And it's a great feeling. It's funny because this\nlast tour that I did, we didn't have hotels every night. We had hotels maybe like once a week. And I hadn't done that before usually. I'm frequently in hotels, so I didn't get that space that\nI'm really used to getting. - [Lex] You missed them? - I very much missed it and\nhad to be very creative. And I ended up like,\ngoing into the back lounge when everyone was asleep and like meditating back there, or like before everyone woke up. And I actually like joined, there was like an online\nmeditation retreat that was happening. It was like 12 hours a\nday of silent meditations that happens once a year. And I love this particular\ngroup of people, and they knew I was on\ntour so they were like, \"Just join when you can.\" And so I was on the tour doing the meditation retreat at the same time. It was so fun. It was so fun because I was\nlike, in the back lounge, the bus is like moving around like this. My laptop, the Zoom is like\n(imitates laptop whirring), and I'm just like sitting like meditating. It was, it's like, yeah, this is the shit. - It's silence. So, they're all connected to Zoom and just doing silent 12 hours a day? - Yeah, yeah.\n- That's cool. - These particular retreats\nthat I started doing, it's not straight silent. There are silent sits\nevery hour for 50 minutes and then there's some talks, and like these people\nthat I've been working with are really cool because they're integrating\nSpiral Dynamics into zen and it's like the coolest combination. - [Lex] What's Spiral Dynamics? - Like Ken Wilber, do you know Ken Wilber? Integral Theory? - Yes, can you explain a little bit? So, I vaguely know of him because of kind of this\nnotion that everything is one, like everything is integrated, that every field has truths and falsehoods and we should integrate the truths. - Yeah. It's hard to explain how it applies to this type of meditation because it's in the guided\nparts of the meditation that this whole like holonic theory is like brought in about like transcending and including every aspect of your being because he talks about\nlike levels of development and like in consciousness and how like this applies to like every single religion or non-religion that there are these levels of development and that go all the\nway up to enlightenment no matter what you start off with. It could be Christianity,\nBuddhism, Vedanta, it doesn't matter, like anything. Then I just like, I\nlike it when everything and everyone is taken into account. It doesn't matter where\nyou're coming from, that there is a way to be\nself-realized, self-actualized. There are self-actualized beings from all walks of life with\nvery, very different paths. There's no one path. I mean, in this particular retreat I do, there's like a lot of silence sits and then there's some guided meditations. But this, I've tried a\nlot of different avenues and they're all great. So I wouldn't just say,\njust try this one thing. Like I've studied like the Upanishads like with Vedanta teachers and like gone through those texts for months and months and\nstayed at monasteries. And like how they break\nit down makes total sense to my mind and heart and like my, more importantly than my\nmind, like my inner knowing. Like it resonates and-\n- Inner knowing. - Yeah, because like your mind\nis like the thinking tool. Like it's not you, you're not your mind. You're not your thoughts,\nyou're not your body, you know? So it's like just the you. Like, that knowing that you have, that's kind of when\nsomething resonates there, that's usually when you go with something. - What's living in a monastery like? - It's the best. - [Lex] What are we talking about? Like what- - It's just in an empty room\nwith like a tiny single bed and a sheet and a pillow and that's it. - That's it? - You have to eat the\nsame thing as everyone. - What's the food like? What is it? - Very plain, cheap, basic food, which is funny for someone like me because I'm pretty\nparticular about my diet. - Yeah, you brought over like\n20 different ingredients. - (laughs) Yeah. - So what was the like day in the life of Tal at a monastery? - You wake up at five a.m. to the bell and you go and meditate like constantly. - So the-\n- Till bedtime, other than two meals. - Well, how are you sitting? Are you in a group? Is there other people there?\n- Mm hm. - And you're just sitting there? - Well, yeah, if you're talking\nabout the zen monastery, because I stayed in zen monastery and I did a thing with the\nguy I was telling you about that kind of the integral zen thing where he uses Ken Wilber's\nwork in combination with zen. That's a little bit different 'cause he does talks,\nwe talk about things, and that's very separate\nfrom the monastery, like the Vedanta\nmonasteries I've stayed at, which there's very little meditation in terms of sitting silently. Instead we are meditating\non the scriptures, like the Upanishads. And we're like, diving into that. - What were the differences, the takeaways from the experiences? The two different, the integral one and the meditating on the scriptures? - They're both have been\nincredibly helpful to me because the Vedanta, anytime I go into my head about something, the answer is there\nbased on this knowledge. And with the zen monastery, it's like you just gotta\nput your butt in the seat and sit and wait, and maybe something will\nhappen, maybe it won't, but just keep sitting\nand it's very disciplined and you go through a lot. Your body's purging a lot. There's a lot. And you don't necessarily have the answers as to what is happening. And so I think for somebody\nlike me, I need both. I need to be in a place where\nthere's complete uncertainty, but complete discipline and just doing the regimented thing. And then there's the me\nthat feels very satisfied from an analytical standpoint, understanding what's happening. Like, what is the gross and\nthe subtle body and the, like I wanna understand these things about what it is to be a human. So, I like 'em both. - \"Understand what it\nmeans to be a human.\" So that like, having that patience and just sitting with\nyourself helps you do that? - Yes. More so like the analysis part helps. - Oh, so the analysis,\nthe actual, okay, got it. - But sitting with yourself,\nthere's no better education. - Yeah.\n- Of like facing every demon and it's all gonna come out\nand it's not gonna be pretty. But then there's things that happen on the other side of it\nthat are so profound. - Have you met most of your demons? - I've met the demons that\nhave come out (laughs). - Oh, there may be more? - Who knows? Yeah.\n- Okay. Well, to be continued. (chuckles) What, since\nI think I heard you say that you wrote a love\nsong after \"Taxi Driver.\" What kind of love songs\ndo you write more of? Broken... So you're a songwriter first\nfor people who don't know. They might think you're\nprimarily a bassist, but you're-\n- But they're wrong. - So, do you write (laughs)\nmostly broken heart ones or like hopeful love songs? In love songs, about to be in love songs, soon to fall in love songs? - Well, the last album I put out, that is pretty self-explanatory\nas to what that is. - A lot of pain that one? - There was, yeah. Some of it was storytelling and some of it was real experience. And it's always like a\ncombination of things. Like, I serve the song. So, sometimes you use\nyour own life experience to tell a song and sometimes\nyou may watch a movie and part of that script merges\nwith your own experience and that tells the right story for the point you're\ntrying to make in the song. So, it varies from song to song. Like, in terms of how like\nautobiographical it is. - Yeah. I always think at the\nend of the \"Taxi Driver\" when what's her name, Betsy, because Travis becomes a hero. She tries to get with\nhim and he rejects her. That was so, that's powerful. - My favorite love songs are the ones where you're not sure\nit's about romantic love or love of God or love of\nlife or just pure just love. Like, I was thinking like George Harrison\nwrites songs like that. Like, \"What Is Life?\" Or like Bob Dylan song that\nGeorge Harrison covered, \"If Not for You.\" - [Lex] Yeah, I was just\ngrateful for his love, yeah. - Right, right. That's kind of like where, well, what I'm experiencing now. And so, who knows what will\nend up coming out, but- - So, you've been writing this kinda- - Yeah, I've been writing.\n- A little bit? - I don't have like an intention of like putting something out in any particular timeframe, but I'm just writing\nand letting things flow and yeah, there's like a bunch of like Leonard Cohen\nsongs to where you're like, there's so many ways\nto interpret this song. And there's so many ways... I just love songs that don't, aren't like, so like specifically about one thing. - Mm hm. I really love the song to play it, to listen to \"Wonderful\nTonight\" by Eric Clapton and I thought it was\npretty straightforward. - Yeah.\n- And then I had a conversation with Eric Weinstein who's a mutual friend of ours. - Yeah.\n- And he told me it's not about what I thought it's about. - Oh yeah, what did he say? - It's a more complicated story. It's actually a man. So, \"Wonderful Tonight\" is\na story about a man being, just finding his wife beautiful and appreciating it throughout. But he said it was actually\na man missing his wife, that he's imagining that she's lost because of the decisions\nhe's made in his life, so it's pain.\n- Hm. - And he had a long\nbeautiful Eric Weinstein like explanation of why. - I love those. - Have you and Eric played music? - No, we've just hung out and had very long\nconversations about everything. - He's a bit of a musician, you know? - Yeah.\n- Okay. You picked up the guitar when you were 14. Let's go back. And one interesting thing that just jumped out at\nme is you said you learned how to practice in your head because you only had 30 minutes. - Yeah.\n- Your parents would only let you practice for 30 minutes. - Yeah. - I read somewhere the\nColtrane did the same. He was not the practice part, but he was able to play\ninstruments in his head as a way to like think\nthrough different lines, different musical thoughts,\nthat kind of stuff. - Yeah.\n- And just maybe can you tell the story of that? - Yeah, I just grew up in a environment that was focused on academia. - Yeah.\n- And I fell in love with guitar and really just\nwanted the focus to be that. So, my limit was 30 minutes a day for, I don't even remember\nhow many times a week. Might've been every day or\nfive days a week, whatever. - So your parents didn't want\nyou to play more than that? - No. And so I just learned how to visualize the fret board in my head and I'd practice all day in my head. It was kind of like, you\nknow \"The Queen's Gambit,\" the TV show with Anya\nTaylor-Joy and she just like sees it on the ceiling.\n- On the ceiling. - I used to do that with the front board. Yeah, and just practice.\n(Lex laughs) And I actually recommend\nit to every musician because if you're just practicing here, you don't know what is\nmore dominant necessarily. Is it this or is it your motor skills? If you just take that away and do it here, you know you've got it. So, I'm glad that that happened and that I learned how to do that. And in terms of like learning fast, 'cause like I had to like learn how to, well, I had to try to\nabsorb a lot of information in a short amount of time when\nI did have the instrument. I kind of would like do things in bursts. Like even in that half\nan hour I would just go, like play for a couple minutes and then I'd stop for like a minute and then I'd do it again. And I noticed there was\nlike a huge difference between the first time and the second time whereas if I just kept repeating stuff, it would be like much slower. - Well, what did you do\nin the, when that minute- - Just hang out. - Just integrate, like-\n- Yeah, just like my brain. It's like my brain was telling me like, just chill out for a sec. That's enough information. Let me take a second to integrate that. That's what at least\nwhat it felt like to me. And the most hilarious thing\nhappened a couple months ago. I know you're friends\nwith Andrew Huberman. So he put out some clip,\nwhich was a part of one of his podcasts about learning. And he said that there\nwas some research done on learning fast and that\nif you practice something for a minute or so and then you let your brain rest for 30\nseconds or a minute, that in that 30 seconds or a minute your brain does the repetition 20 to 30 times faster and in reverse. And I was like, whoa, that's so cool 'cause that's what I used\nto do when I was a kid. Like, now there's science that proves that which is really cool for musicians to know that that's a good way\nto practice efficiently because you know, like some musicians, they're like practicing for\nsix, seven, eight hours a day. I've never done that. I've never practiced more\nthan an hour a day even now. Like, I've just, that's\nmy technique and it works. - Are you also practicing\nin your head sometimes? - Now I'm not practicing as much. I'm more always writing songs in my head. So that's why I like silence. That's why I love being\nin the empty hotel room and being alone or songs come\nto me while I'm showering or walking around doing the dishes, or occasionally when I'm\nhanging out with friends or like comedians and people\nwill just like say shit and I'll be like, that's a cool line. Just like jot it down on my phone. - So it's not always musical,\nit's sometimes lyrical. - It's more lyrical than musical now because it's like, for me it's like, well, there's so much music in the world. If I'm going to write a song, I want the song to be about\nsomething interesting. And so yeah, the words matter to me. - Yeah, and the right word\ncan, has so much power. It's crazy.\n- Yeah. - Like we said with Leonard Cohen and then they're often simple. The really powerful ones are simple. - And like you, when you\nmentioned \"Hallelujah,\" he wrote like 80 verses to \"Hallelujah\" before he narrowed it down to like four and it took him like 15, 20\nyears to write that song. So, some writers will do that, like, and then other writers just vomit it out and it's beautiful. Like, I've heard that Bob\nDylan or Joni Mitchell, they're like, they're fast writers. They just kinda, it just kinda comes out. - That makes me feel so good\nto know Leonard Cohen wrote so me verses of that, like that that was so\ndeliberately crafted. Extensively, rigorously crafted. - He just would spend months and years and constantly refining and refining. - Do you have songs like that for yourself where you've refined for many years? - Yeah, it's song dependent. Some just flow out and\nit's like, oh there it is. Everything's there. And then other songs, it's like, you might have\nstarted it with music and there's some words that come out and then trying to fill\nin the rest of the word. Sometimes it can be like a\nsquare peg in a round hole and other times it's\nlike, \"Oh no, I can...\" It depends. Sometimes it becomes like a math problem and hopefully it doesn't 'cause you just wanna say what's right for the song. And usually when you write it all together like the lyric and the melody and the chords and everything's kind of developing at once, at least for the first draft, that's very, very helpful. Like Sondheim used to write like that. Just like he wouldn't move on until like, he would just go this way. Whereas for me it's just like,\nI'll just go with what seems to be coming naturally and\nI'll just let it be what it is and then you come back and you say, okay, well, what do I\nhave to do to this now? Well, what's needed? - Just to linger on the learning process, what would you recommend\nfor young musicians on how to get good? What are the different\npaths a person can take to understand it deeply enough\nto create something special? - I think first and foremost understanding why you are playing music. If it's 'cause you have something that you're trying to express or that you're just in love\nwith expression itself, with art itself, those are great reasons to start this journey. - The why should be- - I think the why is really important 'cause it's a jagged lifestyle\nand there's a lot in it. And so, if you don't have your purpose, if you're not centered in your purpose, then all that jagged lifestyle\nis probably gonna get to you. - Jagged? That's an interesting word.\n- Jagged. Yeah, it's jagged. It's all over the place, it's uncertain. It's one thing one moment and a completely different\nthing another moment. You never know what's gonna happen. And if you thrive on variety,\nwhich I love variety, then it's perfect but also every human being needs a certain amount of certainty and structure. And so it's, the certainty can\ncome from your inner knowing, knowing that you're doing exactly what you want to be doing and knowing what your purpose is in doing it, in this expression. Otherwise you're just kinda\nlike a leaf blowing in the wind. - Like in the early days touring, just playing clubs seems like tough. - Yeah.\n- It's a lot. - Yeah, it's a lot of like, the physical labor aspect\nof it is really hard. Playing on stage to two\npeople or 2,000 or 20,000, that doesn't make a difference. I mean, it makes a difference\nto the ticket sales, which informs what level of luxury you might\nhave on the road or not. But other than that it's just people there listening to music. The music doesn't change. - Does it make it tougher when\nit's two people versus 200? - No. - So even if nobody recognizes whatever the thing you're doing. - No, because the idea is to be doing, like, having a great\nconversation on stage. - The audience can come and go. - Yeah. I mean, I always like... At like, there's certain points in shows where I'm just like, I consciously am like, oh yes, there's an audience over there because I'm so like wrapped up in whatever's happening on stage. - You forget yourself. - Well, maybe I'm remembering myself. - [Lex and Tal] Oh! - Damn.\n(Tal laughs) Call back somehow, feels like one. Okay. You think every instrument\nis its own journey as you play guitar, you\nplay bass, you sing. Just the mastery of an instrument, or let's avoid the word mastery, the understanding of an\ninstrument is its own thing or are they somehow like\nphysical manifestations of the same thing? - It's both, like every instrument has its strengths, beauty,\nlimitations, range, like possible range that can be extended to some degree or another\ndepending on who you are. Like trumpet or something, like certain people can hit\nhigher notes than others, blah, blah, blah. But that being said, we're\nall playing the same 12 or 24 or however you divide the octave, that many notes, we're all\nplaying the same notes. So, in that sense it's all the same thing. It's just music or better yet it's just art or expression. But yeah, every instrument has, you gotta go through the\nphysical aspects of it, the motor skills and all of that. And hopefully you get\nthrough that really quickly so you can get to the expression quickly 'cause if you get stuck\nin just that first phase, that's be really boring. - Yeah, but that's a pretty long phase. The technical skill required\nto really play an instrument. - For some people it's a long thing and some people it's short. It very much varies. It might have to do\nwith like how you learn and getting to know like,\nyour strengths in learning, like more oral or more\nlike, is it more like... Like what's your strength and playing off of those strengths. So, for me, like it was,\nlike I was saying earlier, it was just an intuitive\nthing that I knew, I can feel when my brain is full, like that it needs processing time. And so, I listen to that. I don't push past it, even\nif it's like one minute and I do something, I'm like, okay. Silence. And then I come back and it's in and I trust that it's gonna\nbe there and is there. So, just trusting yourself\nI think is really important. Trusting that you know you better than anybody else is gonna know you. So, that's the kind of thing with teachers that can be either really,\nreally helpful and great or really not great. Like, I'm primarily self-taught. I've had amazing mentors\nof all walks of life and I think I'm unbelievably blessed that my mentors are some of\nmy favorite musicians on earth whether it's Leonard Cohen or\nJeff Beck or Wayne Shorter, whoever these people are, like, they are my favorite musicians. So, not everyone has that opportunity, but what the opportunity that we have now that I didn't have when I was starting is that everything's on YouTube. Like every interview with every genius, like you don't need to necessarily have these people in person now. I mean it, and then I'll\nsay to that, yes and no. I agree with myself and then\nI don't agree with myself. And the reason is, I do\nbelieve that there is something that happens when you're\nin person with a master in some cases that there\nis something transferred that is not intellectual, it's not spoken, it's something else that happens, that can happen that I've experienced and I really value that. - And I think that applies to specific disciplines\nand also generally. Like, I've been around\nOlympic gold medalists just to hang out with\nthem for several days. And there's something about greatness. There's a way about them that kind of permeates\nthe space around them. You kind of learn something from it. - Yeah.\n- Even if you don't practice that particular discipline. - Yeah.\n- There's something to it. If you're able to see it. I also like what you said about the playing stuff in your head, that it forces you to not be lost in the physical learning\nof the instrument. I think that's one of the things I probably regret a little bit. So, I play both piano and guitar and I've have become quite over the years technically proficient at the instruments.\n- I've seen. - But I think my mind is\nunderdeveloped because of that. Meaning like, I can't really, like, I can feel the\nmusic when it's created, but I can't create out of the feeling. I haven't practiced the projecting the feeling onto the music,\n- Oh, yeah? - you know what I mean? - [Tal] Hm. - And I'm not like a musician, but I'm just, it's a different muscle that I think is, if you really want to create beautiful things, you have to, the creation happens here, not with your hands.\n- I think it's more here. - Or whichever. It's some part of the body, but it's not with your fingers. - Yeah, 'cause I think\nthe fingers is more this. - [Lex] Sure. - And then-\n- Yes. Yeah, it is here.\n- Yeah. - Right. And it's just nice that you said that 'cause it's probably really, it's really good advice\nif you wanna create. - Yeah, slowing down is really great too. - [Lex] What do you mean slowing down? - Slowing everything down. It could be, I can play\nsomething really fast, but I may wanna like practice it. Let's see. Like... (slow bass music playing) - [Lex] Go as slow as possible. - Because there's all\nthese micro movements that are happening that if you just go... (fast bass music playing) Like, you can't pay as close attention to the exact tone that you're\npulling from each note. And there's a lot to pay attention to, to how my fingers are\ntouching the string here. Like, I can change my tone a million ways just by the direction of this finger. And same with how this lands and how hard I'm attacking the string and with what intention\nam I hitting the string? Emotionally, physically. And so, even if you can go\nblah, blah, blah, blah, blah, play that so slow. See how locked into a pocket you can be. See how you... Like, feel every aspect of that 'cause then when it gets sped\nup, it's still there with you. Yeah.\n- Mm hm, that's brilliant. - It's kind of like the transcended and included thing that\nKen Wilber talks about. Like, it's like- - And I guess that's what\nmeditation can do for you is to like really listen to your, like, observe every aspect of your body, the breath and all this. Here you're observing every element, like every super detailed\nelement of playing a single note. - [Tal] Yeah. - That's cool that if you speed it up, it's still there with you. - It is. Yeah, it is because I hear\nthere are certain people, it's like they play really fast, but I don't hear the\nfullness of tone always. And it's like, well, it's probably 'cause maybe they didn't, maybe it's 'cause they didn't slow it down and really sit with each note and let it like, resonate\nthrough their whole being. It's spiritual, it's like\na spiritual expression. It's not just like, it's not a sport. A lot of people treat music like a sport. - Yeah. Since starting to learn\nmore like Stevie Ray Vaughan versus Jimi Hendrix, I would spend a quite a long time on single notes of just bending. Just like, just listening\nto what you can do with bends, spending. Just thinking like, people like B.B. King and all these blues musicians, like spend a career just\nmaking a single note cry. - [Tal] Yeah. - There's like an art form to that. - [Tal] Yeah. - And I think you putting it, like taking it really slow, which I never really thought\nof is really good idea. Like, really slow it down. - It's the same with like\nsitting with your own emotions. It's like when emotions\nare overwhelming to us, we get real busy or we move real fast 'cause it's like we don't\nwanna feel our feelings. And those are the moments\nto slow yourself down. - And observe it. Anger, jealousy, loneliness.\n- And just be with it. Yeah, just be with it. Be like, be cool with it. Like love it, love the anger and- - It's all beautiful. (Tal laughs) Can you educate me on the\ndifference between bass? - Base and bass? Okay, well, one is a fish. - (laughs) At least I\npronounced it correctly. That's good. It's all about the piece. - Can you pronounce my name? - Tal.\n- Wow. Most people say Tal, or Tal.\n- Tal. - You said Tal.\n- Who says Tal? - Like, so many people. - In the south maybe Tal.\n- I don't know, but the fact that you said my name right, you get extra points.\n- Oh, honey Tal. I didn't know it was a game. Am I winning?\n- Yep. - I like winning. (Tal laughs) - How do you play the bass? What's the difference between\nfinger style and slap? - Slap is like this,\nfinger style is like this. - You ever ever played bass with a pick? - Yeah, sometimes. - I'm not accusing you of anything. - No accusation taken. - I don't know if these are\nsensitive topics, like if- - That would be pretty hilarious if I was sensitive about bass techniques, but like, not about like love. - It just looks so cool to like slap it and I don't understand what that's about. Like that thumb thing that- - Yeah. I slap less, a lot less. Almost never actually. It has a very distinctive sound and does a very\ndistinctive thing to a song that is not something I hear needed very often in music today. - Yeah. - But in certain styles like funk it sounds awesome and it makes sense. It was something that was a\nbit overused at one point. For instance, like my\nmentor Anthony Jackson, he refused to slap. Like, he actually said,\nif you want me to slap, I'll leave this gig. So, I'm not like that. - See, that's why I said sensitive. See I was like reading into it. - Because he's sensitive about it. - I was feeling the spiritual energy of the sensitivity\n- Yeah, of Anthony Jackson? - of Anthony Jackson. - And then, I mean, I'm\nplaying electric bass, so generally speaking,\nyou don't particularly wanna hear electric bass on\nstraight ahead jazz anyway. You wanna hear an upright bass. But if I was to play\njazz on an electric bass, I might even kind of like palm mute. Like, instead of going like\n(mellow bass music playing), I might go (light bass\nmusic playing) to there. Anything to kind of make the notes shorter and less resonant and like\nkind of fade away quick 'cause the upright does that naturally. And I have like a different bass, like a hollow body harmony that sounds closer to an upright that I'll use in certain, like on my song \"Under\nthe Sun\" that I put out, that was on a harmony bass. And it has like kind\nof an upright acoustic kind of tone to it, but with more sustain. - [Lex] And is jazz fusion the style where you have like an electric base? Can you educate me with the jazz fusion? - Again, you can have both. You can have both on... You can have either on anything. There's no like real rules. - Now, I've heard you say\nsomething interesting, which is, well, a lot of\nthings you say is interesting, but-\n- Just one thing. - Just one that- - [Tal] And it's what time you're leaving. - What time was that again? - (laughs) Three minutes. - That it's maybe easier sometimes to define a musical genre\nby the don'ts than the dos, the don'ts than the dos. What are the don'ts of jazz and rock? What are the don'ts of jazz usually? What are the don'ts\nand any domain of life? What are the don'ts? - The don'ts is just to please\nleave your fear at the door. And your dos is to be open to anything and open your ears. Like, respond to what's happening now. I think that quote you're talking about might have been more about an individual\nmusician's unique sound because everyone has their sound. If they've developed their voice and they've listened to their\nown aesthetic preferences, of which everyone is slightly different, everyone has slightly\ndifferent likes and dislikes, then you'll have a unique\nsound on your instrument. And your unique sound is defined more by the choices you make rather than, I mean it's equally as defined by the choices you make and\nthe choices you don't make. I mean, it's the flip side\nof the same coin really. - Yeah, there's certain musicians you can just tell it's them just, you hear a few notes and you're\nlike, oh, okay, it's them. Tone, sometimes it's tone. Sometimes it's the way they play rhythm. - Yeah. It might, that quote you're talking about might have even had to do with someone's like real limitations on an instrument that\nthen that would define their sound is the things that they can't, like actually can't do versus like what you're choosing to do\nversus not choosing to do, which is that like flip\nside of the same coin thing. - How many fingers you play with? It seems like a lot of\nthe greatest musicians aren't technically like perfect. The imperfections is the\nthing that makes them unique and where a lot of the\ncreativity comes from. I mean, Hendrix, Hendrix\nhad a lot of those things, the way he put like a thumb over the top. - Well, his hands were huge.\n- Yeah. - There was no other\nplace for the thumb to go. And it was great that he could reach the E string and that was an advantage. - And he was a lefty playing\na right handed guitar. - [Tal] Yeah, yeah. - Flipped, I guess.\n- Yeah. - That's weird. That probably doesn't\nhave much of an effect. Maybe a spiritual one, I don't know. - Actually flipping a guitar is different. It does bring out\nsomething different in you 'cause I've done it, like\nflipped it and it's like, oh wow. Yeah, really, it's really different. I remember talking to my\nlike osteopath about like, 'cause there's so much\nweight on this shoulder while I'm playing all the time and they were saying like, \"Well, just after shows, just literally just turn it upside down and do the exact same\nthing in the opposite way. It'll like even out your body.\" And I was like, \"Oh, that's good advice.\" - Have you actually tried it? - Mm hm.\n- Okay. All right. I'll write that down. (both chuckling) All right, well, do you\nknow a guy named Davie504? - [Tal] I've heard of him. - I've recently learned of him. He's a YouTuber and a bass player. He's amazing.\n- Cool. - He combines memes and also just these brilliant bass compositions\nand says slap like a lot. He's big into slapping. - Yeah.\n- That's how, he's the one that kind of made\nme realize this is a thing. Okay. And he also said that\nyou're one of the best, if not the best bassists in the world. There was a bunch of his fans that rode in and he analyzed the Jeff Beck thing that\nwe watched at Crossroads is one of the greatest\nsolos ever, bass solos ever. So, shout out to him. What does that make you feel like? You're the greatest of all time? - Chocolate cookies. - Chocolate, is that your favorite? - I like macadamia nut. Like, if you really wanna get into it with like white chocolate. - Yeah. That's a rare one for people\nto say is the favorite. - Chocolate chip is just like easy. You can kinda get them anywhere. - Yeah. Last thing you wanna be\nis easy in this world. You don't wanna be easy. You said that, \"I love\nrock and roll,\" quote. \"I love folk, I love jazz, I love Indian, classical music. I really love all kinds of music as long as it's authentic\nand from the heart.\" So when you play rock versus jazz, you play all kinds of music. What's the difference technically, musically, spiritually for you? - Well, there's no spiritual difference. - [Lex] Okay, all right. Cross that off the list. - But well, musically,\nyeah, it's kind of like what was saying earlier. It's like each genre has its language of what makes it that genre. And that would be a good thing to say, it's defined by the do's and don'ts because yeah, it's like,\nI'm trying to think. Basically I put the song first and I think of the song as the melody, the lyrics and then the harmony\nand obviously the groove. - So, the song goes before\nthe genre in a sense, each song is like its own thing. - They're both things\nthat are held in my mind. It's like, okay, genre and then song, which is comprised of\nthose basic elements. And I tend to kind of prioritize lyric because somebody is trying to\nexpress something over music. And so that the lyric\nis very, very important. And so, then the choices come from there. It's like, okay, within the genre of X, this is the typical language. And then how do I best serve this lyric? And then where else can I pull from that might not be in these two bags that would put a little twist on it? So, those are all the kinds of things I might be thinking about but I don't like twists for\nthe sake of twists either. I like twists because I wanna hear something that might be fresh. But when someone does\nsomething just to be hip, it's annoying to me. I think you can hear the difference. It's like when people, like they write in odd time signatures or like they write all these riffs just because they can, just 'cause they have the chops to do it or they know how to play\nan 1116 and whatever. Just like, but if it's\nnot actually creating a piece of music that's\ngoing to move somebody, then why are you doing it? And so, I think a lot of the questions I'm asking myself when I'm approaching a song are mainly\nphilosophical and aesthetic. - So, you like to stand\non the edge of the cliff, not for the thrill of it, but 'cause that's where\nyou find something new? - Yeah, yeah.\n- Potentially? - And it's thrilling. - But you're not doing\nit just for the thrill. - I'm not doing it for the thrill. It just happens to be thrilling. - All right. - Because you can always reel it back in. - Can you, though?\n- Yeah, you can. - No.\n- You can like, do a totally like disciplined, like I can go into a session and okay, my favorite thing about\ngoing into a session with musicians that I adore\nis that we don't hear the demo 'cause if you hear a demo, you're hearing what the producer or songwriter have already imagined that every instrument is playing. And then it's like, well, I've\nalready heard what you want. Now my mind is, part of my mind is focused on what I already know you want and what the destination's gonna be. Why did you bring me in here? I wanna not hear it. I just want you to sit at a piano and sing the song with the, I wanna hear the chords and the lyric or sit\nin an acoustic guitar, play it and then let's all go\nin the room and then take one, I would say 80% of the time\ntake one has the most gold. And there might be like a mistake or two or someone forgot to go to the B section and you might wanna like punch that in so that you're hitting the right chord. But all the magic is in that take. And then sometimes it happens\nwhere it's like you go, it's like we're rehearsing and take one, two, three, four, five. And then you're like\nthinking about it too much and then you go and you have a dinner and you come back and the next take one after dinner is the one. Like, it's usually after\nthere's some sort of a break, but obviously there's\nexceptions to that rule. Sometimes it's take two and three. - Yeah, you said that this is something that surprised you about recording with Prince is that he would just, so much of it would be take one, it would just move so quickly. - Yeah, well, with that particular album that we made together, it's\ncalled \"Welcome to America,\" he called me up and asked me, he said, \"I wanna make a band with you. I'm like really inspired by what you are doing with Jeff Beck. I wanna make a trio. Do you like the drum\nrolls of Jack DeJohnette,\" was like his first question to me. I'm like, \"Well, yeah, who doesn't? Who doesn't like Jack DeJohnette?\" Like one of the greatest of all time. And he's like, \"Well, sounds like,\" 'cause we had a discussion about drumming, \"Sounds like you're kind of\nparticular about drummers, so why don't you find us the drummer and I'll trust you to find the drummer. You can audition some people, send me some recordings and\nmaybe your two favorites and I'll pick out of\nthe two or something.\" So I did that. Went on a journey, found a couple guys. He picked the one, we\nwent in and he basically just would be like, \"Okay, so the A section's\ngonna go like this and then the B section, I think we're gonna go to G, and duh duh. And then the bridge,\nI might go to be flat, but maybe I'll hold off and dah, dah, dah. Okay, let's go. One, two, three, four.\"\n- Wow. - And then we recorded it, two tape. There was no punch. He did not want me to punch anything. Like it was like, and\nthere was one song called \"Same Page, Different Book.\" And he like, talked through\nit just like he did. And then he had me soloing between each phrase, like little fills. It's like, I didn't know that that was gonna come up and he loved that. He loved to have me on\nthe edge of my seat, like falling off the cliff. That was my first like real, like falling off a cliff\nmoment from somebody else holding me at the edge of the cliff. You know what I mean? Now I just do it on my own 'cause it's so, it's so fun and it makes sense. It's the best thing for the music. - When you say punch the tape, is that when you actually record it? - Like, if you record the tape and there's like say\nlike you hit a bum note, like to punch in means\nto like fix that note, like re-record over that one little area and punch that note in. He didn't want that. He like, he's like,\n\"Well, my favorite record is just like, whatever happened happened. That's that moment in time. Let's make a new moment in time.\" It's great. Nobody makes records like that anymore. Everyone wants to like edit and edit and re-record and this and that. And unfortunately with a lot of music, and I'm not saying all music 'cause there's plenty of\ngreat music coming out, but there's the danger of it being flat because every little imperfection\nis digitally removed. - Well, that's one of the promising things about AI is because it can be so perfect that the thing will actually come back to and value about music is the imperfections\nthat humans can create. - [Tal] Yeah. - There'll be a greater\nvaluation of imperfections. - Yeah. - I mean, you can kind of\nprogram imperfections too. - Yeah, sure. That's also very sad. But then you get closer and closer to what it means to be human. And maybe there'll be AI's among us, they'll be human flawed\nlike the rest of us. Mortal and silly at times (sighs). - (laughs) Another big sigh. - (chuckles) Is it fair to say that you're very melodic on bass? Like you, you make the bass sing more than people normally do? - Is that a compliment? - Yes, I think so. - Thank you. - Moving on to the next\nquestion (chuckles). As by way of understanding, it's just there's something about the way you play bass that just kind of pulls you in the way, when you listen to somebody play a guitar, like a guitar solo. - The thing I love about Jeff Beck is that he played the\nguitar like a singer. And I think that the way that Wayne Shorter played his\nsaxophone, it's like a singer. And I think everyone, every musician aspires to\njust sound like a singer. - So you make it sing. Let me ask you about,\njust come back to Hendrix 'cause you said that you had three CDs, Jimi Hendrix, Herbie Hancock,\nand Rage Against the Machine. First of all, a great combination. I'm a big Rage fan. - It's so funny 'cause\nlike when I listen to some of the music that I\ncreate, like my solo music, I'm like, I could see\nhow this is a combination of Herbie Hancock, Rage\nAgainst the Machine and Jimi Hendrix (laughs). Like, I hear the influence, it's funny. - Just from your musician perspective, what's interesting to you about, what really stands out\nto you about Hendrix? I just would love to hear like a real professional\nmusician's opinion of Hendrix. - I love that he is two voices\ncombined into one voice. So it's like, there is\nhis voice on the guitar and there is his singing voice, and there is the combination\nof the two that make one voice. And of course, the third\nelement is his songwriting and all of this have\nthis beautiful chemistry and all work geniously perfectly together, and there's nothing like it. And he always beat himself\nup about being a singer and like, he didn't like his voice. But it's like, my favorite\nsingers are the singers that don't sound like singers. - Bob Dylan. You said you like Bob Dylan.\n- Bob Dylan. I love Bob Dylan. - You love his voice too.\n- I love his voice. - Can you explain your love affair with Bob Dylan's voice? - He's expressing his lyrics. It's just pure expression. Exactly what he means. I feel everything that he's saying with 100% authenticity. - Yeah.\n- That's what I wanna hear from a singer. I don't care how many runs you\ncan do and blah, blah, blah. Like, I wanna believe what you're saying. - Leonard Cohen is that.\n- Mm hm. There's countless, like Neil Young. I mean there, there's so many musicians. I love Elliot Smith for that reason. - Let me ask you about mentorship. You said teachers and mentors. You had mentors. What's a good mentor for you? Harsh or supportive? - Supportive. - Supportive. You seen \"Whiplash\" the movie? So that guy, somebody screaming at you, like kicking you off the cliff. - Not necessary. I feel like anybody\nthat's truly passionate about something that\nthey wanna be great at or a master of or this and that, they've already got that\nperson inside their own head. You don't need somebody\nelse to do that for you. I think you need love, acceptance,\nguidance, support, time, advice if you ask for it. Just a space, just a nice open space. All my mentors were just that for me, they didn't tell me to do anything. They don't care. Like, because they're not, why do they need to be\ninvested in where I'm going? Only I know where I'm going. So, for some mentor to come and be like, this is what you need to\nbe doing and practice it. It's like, but why? What if that's not my path? That might be your path. So I'm not really, again,\notherwise it feels like a sport. Like, who can run the fastest race? And it's like, well, okay, well, I get that for that, for sport. Maybe it makes sense to have someone a bit more hardcore. But still, like I would say athletes have the same mentality. They've got that in them already, too. Like, so I think more like of a strategic approach to\nmentorship works really well. And mainly just having an open space and just being available to someone. - And kind of show that\nthey see the special in you. - Yeah, yeah.\n- And they give you the room to develop\nthat special whatever. - Exactly, because if you do have that harsh critic inside you, it's like, it is nice to have somebody that isn't like your family or someone that's not obligated any way that just sees your\ntalent and they're like, \"Yeah, I dig what you're doing. Keep doin' it.\" - Yeah, it's funny that that's\nnot always easy to come by. - Do you have any mentors? - Yeah, I've had a few recently, but for most of my life\npeople didn't really, I'm very much like that too. Like somebody to pat me\non the back and say like, like see something in you of value. Yeah, I didn't really have that. So. - Do you wish you did? - Yeah, yeah, but maybe\nthe wishing that I did is the thing that made me who I am, not having it, the longing for that, maybe that's the thing\nthat helped me develop a constant sense of longing, which I think is a way of, because I have that engine in me, it really allows me to deeply appreciate every single moment, every single, everything that's given to me. So like, just a eternal gratitude. So, you never know which are the bad parts and the good parts. So, if you remove one thing, it might be, the whole thing might collapse. I suppose I'm grateful\nfor the whole thing. That one note you screwed\nup so many years ago, that might've been essential. - What about because you do jiu-jitsu? - Yes. So like-\n- Do you? Are you-\n- I don't, my dad does. - Oh, yeah? - My dad's super into it. I love my dad. He's the coolest. But no, I don't do it. He's a blue belt right now. - Nice, nice.\n- Great. - You ever been on the mat with him, like- - Not yet, but I plan on it. - You should do it.\n- What belt are you? - Black belt.\n- Sick. Do you wanna go on that? - Yeah, right. You got the shit talking\npart of jujitsu down. You have to do the technique. - But like for that, like for instance, like do you need a harsh\nmentor or teacher or- - Yeah, but you like, you\nsaid it really beautifully. Like, to me, I agree, there's a difference\nbetween sport and art. - Yeah.\n- They overlap. There's, for sure, but there's something about sport where like perfection is actually like perfection, perfection is really the thing you really wanna get to, the technical perfection. With art it feels like\ntechnical perfection is almost a way to get lost on the path to wherever something unique. So, but yeah, with sport, I definitely, and one of the kind of athletes that loves to have like\na dictatorial coach. - Yeah.\n- Somebody that like helps me really push myself to the limit. - But you are the one\nthat's kind of dictating how hard you're getting pushed in a way. Like you're choosing your mentor. Like that \"Whiplash\" video is like, he didn't ask for that. - In a way he might've. - Well, maybe, maybe subconsciously. - I mean there is-\n- Or it's a movie, so... (both laughing) - Next you're gonna tell\nme they're just actors. I mean, and but yeah,\nhow do we choose things? You don't always choose, but you're kind of maybe\nsubconsciously choose. And some of it, like some of\nthe great Olympic athletes I've interacted with their parents for many years would force\n'em to go to practice until they discovered\nthe beauty of the thing that they were doing\nand then they loved it. So like, at which point does something that looks like abuse become like a gift? It's weird (laughs). It's all very weird. But for you, support and\nspace to discover the thing, the voice, the music within you. - Yeah, it's my personal choice because I'm very familiar\nwith the inner critic and I can bring her out at any point. I don't need help with that. - Oh, so you do have-\n- Yeah. - She's on call.\n- She was on overdrive. That's why now I had to\nwork on that so much. - Yeah, you have a really\nhappy way about you right now. - Thanks. - You're very zen. Can I ask you about Bruce Springsteen? - Yeah, sure. - A lot of songs of his I listen to make me feel this melancholy feeling. It's not just Bruce Springsteen,\nbut Bruce does a lot. What is that about songs that arouse a kind of sad feeling or a\nlonging feeling, or a feeling? What is that? What is that about us humans on the receiving end of the music? - Each frequency does\nelicit a different kind of emotional response. That is real, scientific. - [Lex] You mean like on\nthe physics aspect of it? - Yeah, yeah, the physical level. So, there is that combined with the right kind of lyric and the right kind of\nmelody of the right kind of chord will elicit the very\nparticular kind of emotion. And it is scientific, it can be analyzed. I don't particularly want to analyze it because I don't want to approach things with that in advance. I don't want it to inform where I'm going. I like the feeling to lead me naturally to where I'm writing. But yeah, there's a real\nchemical element to that. And then also, like I was\nsaying, like the lyric, what it means to you, which poetry is supposed to mean something to everybody, like different. It's not supposed to mean one thing. Like you can't analyze and be like, this is what this poet meant. And like we were talking\nabout with Leonard earlier, it's like the broader\nyou can leave a lyric, the better you can appeal to people in so many different ways. And even to the songwriter, like I'll sing some of my\nsongs from five years ago and I'll be like, oh, I didn't even think that it could have meant\nthat, but I guess it does. That's funny. I like just giggle on stage suddenly 'cause a lyric will hit me differently from a different new\nexperience or something. - Have you ever cried listening to a song? - Of course. Weep like a baby in a bathtub. - Which (laughs)? Who's the regular go-to then? Leonard?\n- Leonard. - Leonard, yeah. \"Hallelujah\" is is a\nsong that consistently makes me feel somethin'. - It's holy, his work is holy. And if you were in his presence, I guess there was a lot to that being. - What advice would\nyou give to young folks on how to have a life\nthey can be proud of? - Hm. Just tackle the demons\nas early as possible, whether it's through your\nart or through meditation or through whatever it means, diaries, whatever it is. Just walk towards the\nthings that are scary. - Hm. - Because if you don't,\nthey'll just expand. They become bigger. If you avoid the demons,\nthey become bigger. - What does that mean for you today? Are you still missing Jeff? - I'll always miss Jeff, but I don't feel like a\npiece of me is missing. And same with Leonard. It's that I did give\nthem a piece of myself and maybe they gave me a piece of them that I hold with me and I cherish, but it doesn't feel like I'm less than or they're less than, or anything's less than. Just, you learn to\nappreciate the impermanence of everything in life. Impermanence of everything except for, consciousness I guess you could say is the only thing that is permanent. So, everything else\nyou learn to appreciate that impermanence because\nthe limited amount of time it like in this\nparticular body is, it's enticing. Kind of gives you like a\ntime limit, which is cool. I like that. - [Lex] So you've come to accept your own? - Yeah. Like it's cool that I'm like, okay, I got maybe this amount\nof time, who knows? But if I was-\n- It could end today. - Yeah, if I died today, I'd be really happy with my life. - Okay.\n- It's not like I'm like, oh, I missed out on this and that. - So you really wanna\nmake sure that every day could be your last day and\nyou're happy with that. - I've always lived that way, yeah. I felt this way since I\nwas in my early twenties. I'd be like, yeah, I\ncould die today, sure. I don't wanna die, I\nhave no reason to die. But if I did, I know\nthat I put my everything, all my effort and all my passion and all my love into\nwhatever I've already done. So if my time's up then my time's up. - What role does love\nplay in this whole thing, in the human condition? - Well, love is everything. I mean, if you define love,\nif you're talking about love as in romantic love or\npaternal or maternal love, or if you're talking about love as in an eastern tradition\nlike Vedanta for instance, love is consciousness, love is everything. - That's the only permanent thing. - Yeah. Or if you were to go come from a zen or like a Buddhist perspective,\nthey would say nothingness. Like emptiness is versus fullness. - Well, those guys are really obsessed with the whole suffering\nthing, and letting go of it. - [Tal] Yeah. - Well, I was wondering if you would do me the honor of playing a song? - Do you want a suffering\nsong or a suffering song? - I think I would love a suffering song. - Okay, cool. (Lex chuckles)\n(Tal chuckles) - Do you want a sound check\nand make sure I'm not... - Sound check. One, two. Yeah, sounds really good. - [Tal] This one too, right? All right, count me off. - Yeah. I don't know how to count somebody off. Where do I start? At nine or three? Two, one. - Yeah, you got it. One, two. - [Lex] One, two.
