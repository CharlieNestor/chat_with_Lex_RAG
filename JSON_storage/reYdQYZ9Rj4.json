      "text": "- Whatever reality is,\nit's not what you see. What you see is just an adaptive fiction. - The following is a\nconversation with Donald Hoffman, professor of cognitive\nsciences at UC Irvine, focusing his research on\nevolutionary psychology, visual perception, and consciousness. He's the author of over\n120 scientific papers on these topics, and his most recent book, titled \"The Case Against Reality, Why Evolution Hid The\nTruth From Our Eyes.\" I think some of the most\ninteresting ideas in this world, like those of Donald Hoffman's, attempt to shake the foundation of our understanding of reality, and thus, they take a long\ntime to internalize deeply. So proceed with caution. Questioning the fabric of reality can lead you to either\nmadness or the truth. And the funny thing is you\nwon't know which is which. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Donald Hoffman."

      "section": "Case against reality",
      "text": "In your book, \"The Case Against Reality, why Evolution Hid the\nTruth From Our Eyes,\" you make the bold claim\nthat the world we see with our eyes is not real. It's not even an abstraction\nof objective reality. It is completely detached\nfrom objective reality. Can you explain this idea? - Right, so this is a theorem from evolution by natural selection. So the technical question\nthat I and my team asked was, what is the probability\nthat natural selection would shape sensory systems to see true properties\nof objective reality? And to our surprise, we\nfound that the answer is precisely zero except for one, one kind of structure that we\ncan go into if you want to. But for any generic structure that you might think the world might have. A total order, a topology metric, the probability is precisely zero that natural selection would\nshape any sensory system of any organism to see any\naspect of objective reality. So in that sense, what we're\nseeing is what we need to see to stay alive long enough to reproduce. So in other words, we're\nseeing what we need to guide adaptive behavior. Full stop. - So the evolutionary process, the process that took us from\nthe origin of life on Earth to the humans that we are today, that process does not maximize for truth, it maximizes for fitness, as\nyou say, fitness beats truth. And fitness does not have\nto be connected to truth is the claim. And that's where you have an approach towards zero of probability\nthat we have evolved human cognition, human consciousness, whatever it is, the magic\nthat makes our mind work, evolved not for its ability\nto see the truth of reality, but its ability to survive\nin the environment. - That's exactly right. So most of us intuitively\nthink that surely the way that evolution will\nmake our senses more fit is to make them tell us more truths, or at least the truths we need to know about objective reality, the truths we need in our niche. That's the standard view,\nand it was the view I took. I mean, that's sort of what we're taught or just even assume. It's just sort of like\nthe intelligent assumption that we would all make, but we don't have to just wave our hands. Evolution of natural selection is a mathematically precise theory. John Maynard Smith in the seventies created evolutionary game theory, and we have evolutionary graph theory, and even genetic algorithms\nthat we can use to study this. And so we don't have to wave our hands. It's a matter of theorem\nand proof and or simulation before you get the therms and proofs. And a couple graduate students of mine, Chester Mark and Brian Marion, did some wonderful\nsimulations that tipped me off that there was something going on here. And then I went to a mathematician, Chachan Prakash, and Manish Singh, and some other friends\nof mine, Chris Fields, but Chachan was the real\nmathematician behind all this. And he's proved several theorems that uniformly indicate\nthat with one exception, which has to do with probability measures. The probability is zero. The reason there's an exception\nfor probability measures, so-called sigma algebras\nor sigmative classes, is that for any scientific theory, there is the assumption\nthat needs to be made that the whatever structure, the whatever probabilistic\nstructure the world may have is not unrelated to the\nprobabilistic structure of our perceptions. If they were completely unrelated, then no science would be possible. And so this is technically, the map from reality to\nour senses has to be a, so-called measurable map, has to preserve sigma algebras. But that means it could\nbe infinite to one, and it could collapse all\nsorts of event information. But other than that,\nthere's no requirement in standard evolutionary theory for fitness payoff functions, for example, to preserve any specific\nstructures of objective reality. So you can ask the technical question. This is one of the avenues we took. If you look at all the fitness payoffs from whatever world structure\nyou might want to imagine, so a world with say a total order on it. So it's got end states and\nthey're totally ordered, and then you can have a set of maps from that world into a set of payoffs, say from zero to a thousand or whatever you want your payoffs to be. And you can just literally\ncount all the payoff functions and just do the\ncomputations and count them. And then you can ask a precise question, how many of those payoff functions\npreserve the total order? If that's what you're, or how\nmany preserve the topology? And you just count them and divide. So the number that are homomorphisms versus the total number\nand then take the limit as the number of states in the world and the number of payoff\nvalues goes very large. And when you do that,\nyou get zero every time. - Okay, there's a million\nthings to ask here, but first of all, just in\ncase people are not familiar with your work, let's sort of linger on the big bold statement here. Which is, the thing we see with our eyes is not some kind of limited\nwindow into reality. It is completely detached from reality, likely completely detached from reality. You're saying a hundred percent likely. Okay, so none of this is real\nin the way we think is real, in the way we have this intuition. There's like, this table is\nsome kind of abstraction, but underneath it all, there's atoms, and there's an entire century of physics that describes the\nfunctioning of those atoms and the quarks that make them up. There's many Nobel prizes\nabout particles, and fields, and all that kind of stuff\nthat slowly builds up to something that's perceivable to us, both with our eyes, with our\ndifferent senses as this table. Then there's also ideas of chemistry that over layers of abstraction\nfrom DNA, to embryos, to cells that make the human body. So all of that is not real. - It's a real experience, and it's a real adaptive\nset of perceptions. So it's an adaptive set of perceptions. Full stop. We want to think. - [Lex] The perceptions are real. - So their perceptions are\nreal as perceptions, right? They are, we are having our perceptions, but we've assumed that there's\na pretty tight relationship between our perceptions and reality. If I look up and see the moon, then there is something that\nexists in space and time that matches what I perceive. And all I'm saying is\nthat if you take evolution by natural selection seriously, then that is precluded that\nour perceptions are there. They're there to guide\nadaptive behavior, full stop. They're not there to show you the truth. In fact, the way I think about it is they're there to hide the truth because the truth is too complicated. It's just like if you're\ntrying to use your laptop to write an email, right? What you're doing is toggling\nvoltages in the computer, but good luck trying to do it that way. The reason why we have a user interface is because we don't wanna\nknow that quote unquote truth, the diodes and resistors and all that, that terrible hardware. If you had to know all that truth, your friends wouldn't hear from you. So what evolution gave us was perceptions that guide adaptive behavior, and part of that process, it turns out, means hiding the truth\nand giving you eye candy. - So what's the difference\nbetween hiding the truth and forming abstractions, layers upon layers of abstractions over these low level voltages, and transistors, and chips,\nand programming languages from assembly to Python that then leads you to be\nable to have an interface like Chrome, where you open\nup another set of JavaScript and HTML programming languages that lead you to have a\ngraphical user interface on which you can then send\nyour friends an email? Is that completely detached\nfrom the zeros and ones that are firing away inside the computer? - It's not, of course. When I talk about the user\ninterface on your desktop, there's this whole sophisticated\nbackstory to it, right? The hardware and the software that's allowing that to happen. Evolution doesn't tell\nus the backstory, right? So the theory of evolution\nis not going to be adequate to tell you what is that backstory? It's gonna say that whatever reality is, and that's the interesting thing. It says whatever reality\nis, you don't see it, you see a user interface, but it doesn't tell you\nwhat that user interface is, how it's built. Right, now we can try to look at certain aspects of the interface, but already we're gonna\nlook at that and go, before I would look at neurons and I was assuming that\nI was seeing something that was at least partially true, and now I'm realizing\nit could be like looking at the pixels on my desktop,\nor icons on my desktop, and good luck going from\nthat to the data structures, and then the voltages, and\nthe, I mean, good luck. There's just no way. So what's interesting about this is that our scientific theories are precise enough and rigorous enough to\ntell us certain limits, and even limits of the\ntheories themselves, but they're not going to tell\nus what the next move is. And that's where scientific\ncreativity comes in. So the stuff that I'm\nsaying here, for example, is not alien to physicists. The physicists are saying\nprecisely the same thing, that space time is doomed. We've assumed that space\ntime is fundamental. That we've assumed that\nfor several centuries, and it's been very useful. So all the things that you're mentioning, the particles and all the\nwork that's been done, that's all been done in space time. But now physicists are\nsaying space time is doomed. There's no such thing as\nspace time fundamentally in the laws of physics. And that comes actually out of gravity together with quantum field theory. It just comes right out of it. It's a theorem of those\ntwo theories put together, but it doesn't tell you what's behind it. So the physicists know\nthat the best theories, Einstein's gravity and quantum\nfield theory put together entail that space time\ncannot be fundamental and therefore particles in space\ntime cannot be fundamental. They're just irreducible representations of the symmetries of space time. That's what they are. So space time, so we put the two together. We put together what the\nphysicists are discovering, and we can talk about how they do that. And then the new discoveries from evolution to natural selection, both of these discoveries are\nreally in the last 20 years. And what both are saying is\nspace time has had a good ride,"

      "text": "it's been very useful,\nreductionism has been useful, but it's over, and it's\ntime for us to go beyond. - When you say space time\nis doomed, is it the space, is it the time, is it the\nvery hardcoded specification of four dimensions, or are you specifically referring to the kind of perceptual domain that humans operate in,\nwhich is space time? You think there's a 3D, like our world is three dimensional and time progresses forward, therefore three dimensions plus one, 4D. What exactly do you mean by space time? What do you mean by space time is doomed? - Great, great. So this is by the way, not my quote. This is from, for\nexample, Nima Arkani-Hamed at the Institute for\nAdvanced Study at Princeton. Ed Witten also there, David\nGross, Nobel Prize winner. So this is not just something\nthe cognitive scientists, this is what the physicists are saying. - Yeah, the physicists\nare space time skeptics. - Yeah, they're saying that, and I can say exactly why\nthey think it's doomed, but what they're saying is that, because your question was\nwhat aspect of space time? What are we talking about here? It's both space and time. Their union into space\ntime, as Einstein's theory, that's doomed. And they're basically saying\nthat even quantum theory, this is with Nima Arkani-Hamed especially, so Hilbert spaces will\nnot be fundamental either. So the notion of Hilbert space, which is really critical\nto quantum field theory, quantum information theory, that's not going to figure in the fundamental new laws of physics. So what they're looking for is some new mathematical structures beyond space time, beyond Einstein's four\ndimensional space time, or super symmetric version, geometric algebra signature, 2, 4 kind of, there are different ways\nthat you can represent it, but they're finding new structures, and by the way, they're succeeding now. They found something\ncalled the Amplituhedron, this is Nima and his colleagues,\nthe cosmological polytopes. So there are these like polytopes, these polyhedra in multidimensions, generalizations of simplicities,\nthat are coding for, for example, the scattering\namplitudes of processes in the large Hadron collider\nand other colliders. So they're finding that if they let go of space time completely,\nthey're finding new ways of computing these scattering amplitudes that turn literally billions\nof terms into one term. When you do it in space and time, because it's the wrong framework, it's just a user interface, that's now from the\nevolutionary point of view, it's just user interface, it's not a deep insight\ninto the nature of reality. So it's missing, deep symmetry is something\ncalled a dual conformal symmetry, which turns out to be true\nof the scattering data, but you can't see it in space time. And it's making the computations\nway too complicated, 'cause you're trying to\ncompute all the loops, and fineman diagrams, and\nall the fineman integrals. So see, the fineman approach\nto the scattering amplitudes is trying to enforce two critical\nproperties of space time, locality and unitarity. And so when you enforce\nthose, you get all these loops and multiple different levels of loops. And for each of those\nyou have to add new terms to your computation. But when you do it outside of space time, you don't have the notion of unitarity, you don't have the notion of locality. You have something deeper, and it's capturing some symmetries that are actually true of the data. But then when you look at the geometry of the facets of these polytopes, then certain of them will code\nfor unitarity and locality. So it actually comes out of the structure of these deep polytopes. So what we're finding is\nthere's this whole new world now beyond space time that is making explicit symmetries that are true of the data that cannot be seen in space time. And that is turning the\ncomputations from billions of terms to one or two or a handful of terms. So we're getting insights into symmetries, and all of a sudden the\nmath is becoming simple, because we're not doing something silly. We're not adding up all\nthese loops in space time. We're doing something far deeper. But they don't know what\nthis world is about all. So they're in an interesting position where we know that space time is doomed, and I should probably\ntell you why it's doomed, what they're saying about why it's doomed. But they need a flashlight\nto look beyond space time. What flashlight are we gonna use to look into the dark beyond space time? Because Einstein's\ntheory and quantum theory can't tell us what's beyond them. All they can do is tell us\nthat when you put us together, space time is doomed at 10\nto the minus 33 centimeters, 10 to the minus 43 seconds. Beyond that space time\ndoesn't even make sense. It's just has no operational definition. So, but it doesn't tell you what's beyond. And so they're just looking\nfor deep structures, like guessing. It's really fun. So these really brilliant guys, generic. Brilliant men and women\nwho are doing this work, physicists, are making guesses\nabout these structures, informed guesses. Because they're trying to ask, well, okay, what deeper structure could give us the stuff that we're seeing in space time, but without certain commitments that we have to make in space time, like locality and unitarity? So they make these brilliant guesses, and of course, most of the\ntime you're gonna be wrong, but once you get one or\ntwo that start to pay off and then you get some lucky breaks. So they got a lucky break back in 1986. A couple of mathematicians\nnamed Park and Taylor took the scattering\namplitude for two gluons coming in and high energy and four gluons going out at low energy. So that kind of scattering thing. So it's like, apparently for\npeople who are into this, that's sort of something\nthat happens so often, you need to be able to find\nit and get rid of those, because you already know\nabout that and you need to, so you needed to compute them. It was billions of terms. And they couldn't do it, even the supercomputers couldn't do that for the many billions or\nmillions of times per second they needed to do it. So they begged, the experimentalists\nbegged the theorists, please can you, you gotta. And so Park and Taylor\ntook the billions of terms, hundreds of pages, and miraculously they turned it into nine. And then a little bit later\nthey guessed one term expression that turned out to be equivalent. So billions of terms reduced to one term, that so-called famous\nPark-Taylor Formula, 1986. And that was like, okay,\nwhere did that come from? This is a pointer into a deep\nrealm beyond space and time, but no one, I mean,\nwhat can you do with it? And they thought maybe it was a one-off. But then other formulas started coming up. And then eventually Nima\nArkani-Hamed and his team found this thing called the amplituhedron, which really sort of captures a big part of the whole ball of wax. I'm sure they would say, no,\nthere's plenty more to do. So I won't say they did\nit all by any means. They're looking at the\ncosmological polytope as well. So what's remarkable to me is that two pillars of modern science, quantum field theory with\ngravity on the one hand and evolution by natural\nselection on the other, just in the last 20 years\nhave very clearly said, space time has had a good run. Reductionism has been a\nfantastic methodology. So we had a great ontology of space time, a great methodology of reductionism. Now it's time for a new trick, but now you need to go deeper and show, but by the way, this is\ndoesn't mean we throw away everything we've done. Not by a long shot. Every new idea that we come\nup with beyond space time must project precisely into space time, and it better give us back everything that we know\nand love in space time, or generalizations, or it's not gonna be taken\nseriously and it shouldn't be. So we have a strong constraint on whatever we're going\nto do beyond space time. It needs to project into space time. And whatever this deeper theory is, it may not itself have\nevolution of natural selection. This may not be part of this deeper realm, but when we take the whatever\nthat thing is beyond time and project it into space time, it has to look like evolution\nby natural selection or it's wrong. So that's a strong\nconstraint on this work. - So even the evolution\nby natural selection and quantum field theory\ncould be interfaces into something that\ndoesn't look anything like, like you mentioned, I mean\nit's interesting to think that evolution might be\na very crappy interface into something much deeper. - That's right, they're both telling us that the framework that\nyou've had can only go so far, and it has to stop, and\nthere's something beyond. And that framework, the very framework that is space and time itself. Now of course evolution\nby natural selection is not telling us about like Einstein's relativistic space time. So that was another question\nyou asked a little bit earlier. It's telling us more about\nour perceptual space and time, which we have used as\nthe basis for creating first the Newtonian space versus time, as a mathematical extension\nof our perceptions. And then Einstein then took that and extended it even further. So the relationship between\nwhat evolution is telling us and what the physicists are telling us is that in some sense the\nNewton and Einstein space time are formulated as sort\nof rigorous extensions of our perceptual space, making it mathematically rigorous and laying out the symmetries\nthat they find there. So that's sort of the\nrelationship between them. So it's the perceptual space time that evolution is telling us is just a user interface effectively. And then the physicists are finding that even the mathematical\nextension of that into the Einsteinian\nformulation has to be, as well, not the final story. There's something deeper. - So let me ask you about\nreductionism and interfaces as we march forward from Newtonian physics to quantum mechanics. These are all, in your view, interfaces. Are we getting closer\nto objective reality? How do we know if these interfaces, in the process of science, the reason we like those interfaces is because they're\npredictive of some aspects, strongly predictive about\nsome aspects of our reality. Is that completely deviating from our understanding of that reality? Or is it helping us get\ncloser and closer and closer? - Well, of course one critical constraint on all of our theories is that\nthey are empirically tested and pass the experiments\nthat we have for them. So no one's arguing against\nexperiments being important and wanting to test all\nof our current theories and any new theories on that. So that's all there. We have good reason to believe that science will never\nget a theory of everything. - [Lex] Everything, everything. - Everything, everything, right. A final theory of everything, right? I think that my own\ntake for what it's worth is that Godel's incompleteness theorem sort of points us in that direction. Even with mathematics,\nany finite eczemetization that's sophisticated enough\nto be able to do arithmetic, it's easy to show that there'll\nbe statements that are true, that can't be proven, can't be deduced from within that framework. And if you add the new\nstatements to your axioms, then there'll be always new\nstatements that are true but can't be proven\nwith a new axiom system. And the best scientific theories\nin physics, for example, and also now evolution are mathematical. So our theories are gonna be, they're gonna have their own assumptions, and they'll be mathematically precise, and they'll be theories\nperhaps of everything except those assumptions. Because the assumptions are, we say, please grant me these assumptions. If you grant me these assumptions, then I can explain this other stuff. So you have the assumptions\nthat are like miracles as far as the theory is concerned. They're not explained,\nthey're the starting points for explanation. And then you have the\nmathematical structure of the theory itself, which\nwill have the Godel limits. And so my take is that\nreality, whatever it is, is always going to transcend\nany conceptual theory that we can come up with. - There's always gonna be\nmystery at the edges, right? Contradictions and all that kind of stuff. - [Donald] And truths. - So there's this idea that is brought up in the financial space of\nsettlement of transactions. It's often talked about in\ncryptocurrency especially. So you could do money, cash\nis not connected to anything. It used to be connected to\ngold, to physical reality. But then you can use money to\nexchange value, to transact. So when it was on the gold standard, the money would represent some\nstable component of reality. Isn't it more effective to\navoid things like hyperinflation if we generalize that idea? Isn't it better to connect your, whatever we humans are doing\nin the social interaction space with each other, isn't it better from an evolutionary perspective to connect it to some degree to reality? So that the transactions are settled with something that's universal as opposed to us constantly operating in something that's a complete illusion. Isn't it easy to hyperinflate that, like where you really\ndeviate very, very far away from the underlying reality? Or do you never get in trouble for this? Can you just completely\ndrift far, far away from the underlying reality\nand never get in trouble? - That's a great question. On the financial side,\nthere's two levels at least that we could take your question. One is strictly like\nevolutionary psychology of financial systems. And that's pretty interesting. And there, the decentralized\nidea that defy kind of idea in cryptocurrencies may make good sense from just an evolutionary\npsychology point of view. Having human nature being what it is, putting a lot of faith in\na few central controllers depends a lot on the veracity of those and trustworthiness of those\nfew central controllers. And we have ample evidence time and again that that's often betrayed. So it makes good evolutionary\nsense, I would say, to have a decentralized, I mean, democracy is a step in\nthat direction, right? We don't have a monarch\nnow telling us what to do. We decentralize things, right? Because if the monarch, if\nyou have Marcus Aurelius as you're emperor, you're great. If you have Nero, it's not so great. And so we don't want that. So democracy is a step in that direction. But I think the defy thing\nis an even bigger step and is is going to even\nmake the democratization even greater. So that's one level. - Also the fact that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely is also a consequence of evolution. That's also a feature I think, right? You can argue from the long\nspan of living organisms, it's nice for power to corrupt. So mad men and women throughout history might be useful to teach us a lesson. - We could learn from\nour negative example. - [Lex] Exactly. - So power does corrupt, and I think that you can\nthink about that again from an evolutionary point of view, but I think that your\nquestion was a little deeper. That was, does the\nevolutionary interface idea sort of unhinge science from\nsome kind of important test for the theories, right? Doesn't mean that anything\ngoes in scientific theory, but there's no, if we don't see the truth, is there no way to tether\nour theories and test them? And I think there's no problem there. We can only test things in\nterms of what we can measure with our senses in space and time. So we are going to have to\ncontinue to do experiments, but we're gonna understand\na little bit differently what those experiments are. We had thought that when we see a pointer on some machine in an experiment that the machine exists,\nthe pointer exists, and the values exist even\nwhen no one is looking at them and that they're an objective truth. And our best theorists are telling us no. Pointers are just pointers, and that's what you have to rely on for making your judgements. But that even the pointers themselves are not the objective reality. And I think Godel is telling us not that anything goes, but you know, as you develop new axiom systems, you'll find out what goes\nwithin that axiom system and what testable\npredictions you can make. So I don't think we're untethered. We continue to do experiments, but I think we won't have that we want is a conceptual understanding that gives us a theory of everything that's final and complete. I think that this is,\nto put it another way, this is job security for scientists. Our job, will never be done, is job security for neuroscience. Because before we thought that\nwhen we looked in the brain, we saw neurons and neural networks and axion potentials and\nsynapses and so forth, and that was it. That that was the reality. Now we have to reverse engineer that. We have to say what is beyond space time? What is going on? What is a dynamical\nsystem beyond space time, that when we project it\ninto Einstein space time, gives us things that look like neurons, and neural networks, and synapses. So we have to reverse engineer it. So there's gonna be lots\nmore work for neuroscience. It's gonna be far more\ncomplicated, and difficult, and challenging. But that's wonderful. That's what we need to do. We thought neurons exist\nwhen they aren't perceived, and they don't. In the same way that if I show you, when I say they don't exist, I should be very, very concrete. If I draw on a piece of\npaper a little sketch of something that is\ncalled the Necker cube, it's just a little line drawing of a cube. It's on a flat piece of paper. If I execute it well and I show it to you, you'll see a 3D cube. And you'll see it flip, sometimes you'll see one face in front, sometimes you'll see\nthe other face in front. But if I ask you which face is in front when you don't look? The answer is, well\nneither face is in front, 'cause there's no cube, there's\njust a flat piece of paper. So when you look at the piece of paper, you perceptually create the cube, and when you look at it,\nthen you fix one face to be in front and one face to the other. So that's what I mean when\nI say it doesn't exist. Space time itself is like the cube. It's a data structure that\nyour sensory systems construct, whatever your sensory systems mean now. Because we now have to\neven take that for granted. But there are perceptions\nthat you construct on the fly, and they're data structures\nin the computer science sense, and you garbage collect them\nwhen you don't need them. So you create them and\ngarbage collect them. - But is it possible that it's mapped well in some concrete, predictable\nway to objective reality? The sheet of paper, the\ntwo dimensional space, or we can talk about space time, maps in some way that we\nmaybe don't yet understand, but will one day understand\nwhat that mapping is. But it maps reliably, it\nis tethered in that way. - Well, yes, and so the new theories that the physicists are\nfinding beyond space time have that kind of tethering. So they show precisely how you\nstart with an amplituhedron and how you project this\nhigh dimensional structure into the four dimensions of space time. So there's a precise procedure\nthat relates the two. And they're doing the same thing with the cosmological polytopes. So they're the ones that are making the most\nconcrete and fun advances going beyond space time. And there they're tethering it, right? They say this is precisely\nthe mathematical projection from this deeper\nstructure into space time. One thing I'll say about,\nas a non physicist, what I find interesting\nis that they're finding just geometry, but there's\nno notion of dynamics. Right now they're just\nfinding these static geometric structures, which is impressive. I'm not putting them down. What they're doing is\nunbelievably complicated, and brilliant, and adventurous. It's all those things. - And beautiful. - [Donald] And beautiful, yeah, right. - From a human aesthetic perspective, 'cause geometry is beautiful. - Absolutely. And they're finding symmetries\nthat are true of the data that can't be seen in space time. But I'm looking for a\ntheory beyond space time that's a dynamical theory. I would love to find, and we can talk about that at some point, a theory of consciousness in which the dynamics\nof consciousness itself will give rise to the geometry that the physicists are\nfinding beyond space time. If we can do that, then we'd\nhave a completely different way of looking at how\nconsciousness is related to what we call the brain\nor the physical world more generally. Right now, all of my brilliant colleagues, well 99% of them are trying to, they're assuming space\ntime is fundamental. They're assuming that\nparticles are fundamental, quarks, gluons, leptons and so forth. Elements, atoms and so\nforth are fundamental. And that therefore neurons and brains are part of objective reality. And that somehow when you get matter that's complicated enough, it will somehow generate\nconscious experiences by its functional properties. Or if you're panpsychist,\nmaybe in addition to the physical properties of particles, you add a consciousness property as well. And then you combine these\nphysical and conscious properties to get more complicated ones, but they're all doing\nit within space time. All of the work that's\nbeing done on consciousness and its relationship to the brain has all assumed something\nthat our best theories are telling us is doomed, space time. - Why does that particular\nassumption bother you the most? So you bring up space time,\nI mean that's just one useful interface we've\nused for a long time. Surely there's other interfaces. Is space time just the one of the big ones to build up people's\nintuition about the fact that they just do assume\na lot of things strongly? Or is it in fact the fundamental flaw in the way we see the world? - Well, everything else\nthat we think we know are things in space time. - [Lex] Sure. - And so, when you say\nspace time is doomed, this is a shot to the heart\nof the whole framework, the whole conceptual framework\nthat we've had in science. Not to the scientific method, but to the fundamental ontology and also the fundamental methodology. The ontology of space\ntime and its contents and the methodology of reductionism, which is that as we go to\nsmaller scales in space time, we will find more and\nmore fundamental laws. And that's been very useful for the space and time for centuries, reductionism for centuries. But now we realize that that's over."

      "section": "Reductionism",
      "text": "Reductionism is in fact\ndead, as is space time. - What exactly is reductionism? What is the process of reductionism that is different than\nsome of the physicists that you mentioned that\nare trying to think, trying to let go of the\nassumption of space time? Like beyond, isn't that\nstill trying to come up with a simple model that\nexplains this whole thing? Isn't it still reducing? - It's a wonderful question\nbecause it really helps to clarify two different notions, which is scientific\nexplanation on the one hand and a particular kind of\nscientific explanation on the other, which is the reductionist. So the reductionist explanation is saying, I will start with things that\nare smaller in space time and therefore more fundamental, and where the laws are more fundamental. So we go to just smaller\nand smaller scales. Whereas in science, more\ngenerally we just say, like when Einstein did the\nspecial theory of relativity, he's saying, let me have\na couple postulates. I will assume that the\nspeed of light is universal for all observers in uniform motion. And that the laws of physics for uniform motion are relative. That's not reductionist. That those are saying,\ngrant me these assumptions, I can build this entire concept\nof space time out of it. It's not a reductionist thing. You're not going to smaller\nand smaller scales of space. You're coming up with these\ndeep, deep principles. Same thing with this\ntheory of gravity, right? It's the falling elevator idea, right? So this is not a\nreductionist kind of thing. It's something different. - Simplification is a bigger\nthing than just reductionism. - Yeah, reductionism has\nbeen a particularly useful kind of scientific explanation, for example, in thermodynamics, right? Where the notion that we have of heat, some macroscopic thing\nlike temperature and heat, it turns out that Neil\nBoltzmann and others discover, well hey, if we go to\nsmaller and smaller scales, we find these things\ncalled molecules or atoms. And if we think of them\nas bouncing around, having some kind of energy,\nthen what we call heat really can be reduced to to that. And so that's a particularly\nuseful kind of reduction is a useful kind of scientific explanation that works within a range\nof scales within space time. But we know now precisely\nwhere that has to stop, at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and 10 to the minus 43 seconds. And I would be impressed if it was 10 to the minus\n33 trillion centimeters. I'm not terribly impressed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters. - I don't even know how to comprehend either of those numbers, frankly. Just a small aside, because I am a computer science person, I also find cellular automata beautiful. And so you have somebody\nlike Stephen Wolfram, who recently has been\nvery excitedly exploring a proposal for a data structure\nthat could be the numbers that would make you a little\nbit happier in terms of scale. Because they're very,\nvery, very, very tiny. Do you like this space of\nexploration of really thinking, letting go of space time,\nletting go of everything and trying to think what\nkind of data structures could be underneath this whole mess? - That's right, so if\nthey're thinking about these as outside of space time, then\nthat's what we have to do. That's what our best\ntheories are telling us. You now have to think\noutside of space time. Now, of course I should back up and say, we know that Einstein\nsurpassed Newton, right? But that doesn't mean\nthat there's not good work to do in Newton. There's all sorts of Newtonian physics that takes us to the moon and so forth. And there's lots of good\nproblems that we want to solve with Newtonian physics. The same thing will be true of space time. It's not like we're gonna\nstop using space time. We'll continue to do all\nsorts of good work there. But for those scientists\nwho are really looking to go deeper, to actually find the next, just like what Einstein did to Newton, what are we gonna do to Einstein? How do we get beyond\nEinstein and quantum theory to something deeper? Then we have to actually let go. And if we're gonna do like\nthis automata kind of approach, it is critical that it's\nnot automata in space time. It's automata prior to space time from which we're going to\nshow how space time emerges. If you're doing within space time, well that might be a fun model, but it's not the radical\nnew step that we need. - Yeah, so the space\ntime emerges from that, whatever system. Like you're saying it's\na dynamical system. Do we even have an understanding\nwhat dynamical means when we go beyond? When you start to think about dynamics, it could mean a lot of things. Even causality could mean a lot of things if we realize that everything's\nan interface, right? Like how much do we really know is an interesting question,\nbecause you brought up neurons. I gotta ask you on another,\nagain, another tangent. There's a paper I remember\na while ago looking at, could a neuroscientist\nunderstand a microprocessor? And I just enjoyed that thought experiment that they provided,\nwhich is they basically, it's a couple of neuroscientists, Eric Jonas and Conrad Cording, who used the tools of neuroscience to analyze a microprocessor. So a computer, computer chip. - Now if we lesion it here,\nwhat happens, and so forth. And if you go and lesion into computer, it's very, very clear that\nlesion experiments on computers are not gonna give you a lot\nof insight into how it works. - And also the measurement devices, and the kind of, just\nusing the basic approaches of neuroscience, collecting\nthe data, trying to intuit about the underlying function of it. And that helps you understand that our scientific exploration of concepts, depending on the field, are maybe in the very, very early stages. I wouldn't say it leads us astray, perhaps it does sometimes, but it's not anywhere close\nto some fundamental mechanism that actually makes a thing work. I don't know if you can\nsort of comment on that in terms of using\nneuroscience to understand the human mind and neurons. Are we really far away potentially from understanding in\nthe way we understand the transistors enough to\nbe able to build a computer? So one thing about understanding is you can understand for fun, the other one is to understand so you could build things. And that's when you\nreally have to understand. - Exactly. In fact, what got me into the field at MIT was work by David Maher\non this very topic. So David Maher was professor at MIT, but he'd done his PhD in neuroscience, studying just the\narchitectures of the brain. But he realized that his work, it was on the cerebellum. He realized that his work,\nas rigorous as it was, left him unsatisfied,\nbecause he didn't know what the cerebellum was for and why it had that architecture. And so he went to MIT and\nhe was in the AI lab there, and he said he had this\nthree level approach that really grabbed my attention. So when I was an undergrad at UCLA, I read one of his papers\nin a class and said, who is this guy? Because he said, you have to\nhave a computational theory. What is being computed and why? An algorithm, well how\nis it being computed? What are the precise algorithms? And then the hardware, how does it get instantiated\nin the hardware? And so to really to do\nneuroscience, he argued, we needed to have understanding\nat all those levels. And that really got me,\nI loved the neuroscience, but I realized this guy was\nsaying, if you can't build it, you don't understand it effectively. And so that's why I went to MIT, and I had the pleasure\nof working with David until he died just a\nyear and a half later. So there's been that idea\nthat with neuroscience, we have to have in some\nsense a top-down model of what's being computed and why that we would then go after. And the same thing with the\ntrying to reverse engineer a computing system like your laptop. We really need to understand what the user interface\nis about, and why we have, what are keys on the\nkeyboard for and so forth. You need to know why to really\nunderstand all the circuitry and what it's for. Now we don't, evolution\nand natural selection does not tell us the deeper\nquestion that we're asking, the answer to the deeper question, which is why? What's this deeper reality,\nand what's it up to, and why? All it tells us is that\nwhatever reality is, it's not what you see. What you see is just an adaptive fiction. - So just to linger on this\nfascinating bold question that shakes you out of your dream state, does this fiction still help\nyou in building intuitions as literary fiction does about reality? The reason we read literary\nfiction is it helps us build intuitions and understanding\nand in indirect ways, sneak up to the difficult\nquestions of human nature. Great fiction. Same with this observed reality. Does this interface that we get, this fictional interface\nhelp us build intuition about deeper truths of\nhow this whole mess works? - Well, I think that each\ntheory that we propose will give its own answer\nto that question, right? So when the physicists are\nproposing these structures, like the amplituhedron,\nand cosmological polytope, associohedron, and so\nforth beyond space time, we can then ask your question\nfor those specific structures and say, how much\ninformation, for example, does evolution by natural selection and the the kinds of sensory\nsystems that we have right now give us about this deeper reality? And why did we evolve this way? We can try to answer that\nquestion from within the deeper. So there's not gonna be a general answer. I think we're going to, what\nwe'll have to do is posit these new deeper theories, and then try to answer your question within the framework of\nthose deeper theories, knowing full well that there'll\nbe an even deeper theory. - So is this paralyzing, though? Because how do we know\nwe're not completely adrift, out to sea, lost forever? That our theories are completely lost. So if we can never truly,\ndeeply introspect to the bottom, if it's always just turtles\non top of turtles infinitely, isn't that paralyzing\nfor the scientific mind? - Well it's interesting that you say introspect to the bottom\nbecause there is that, there is one, I mean, again,\nthis is in the same spirit of what I said before, which is it depends on what answer you give to\nwhat's beyond space time, what answer we would\ngive to your question. So, but one answer that\nis interesting to explore is something that spiritual\ntraditions have said for thousands of years,\nbut haven't said precisely. So we can't take it seriously in science until it's made precise, but we might be able to make it precise. And that is that they've also said something like space and\ntime aren't fundamental. They're maya, they're illusion. But if you look inside, if you introspect and let go of all of your\nparticular perceptions, you will come to something\nthat's beyond conceptual thought. And that is, they claim, being in contact with the deep ground of\nbeing that transcends any particular conceptual understanding. If that is correct, now I'm not saying it's correct, but, and I'm not saying it's not correct, I'm just saying if that's correct, then it would be the\ncase that as scientists, because we also are in touch\nwith this ground of being, we would then not be able to conceptually understand\nourselves all the way. But we could know ourselves\njust by being ourselves. And so there would be a sense in which there is a fundamental grounding\nto the whole enterprise, because we're not separate\nfrom the enterprise. This is the opposite of\nimpersonal third person science. This would make science be personal, personal all the way down,\nbut nevertheless scientific because the scientific\nmethod would still be what we would use all the way down for the conceptual understanding. - Unfortunately, you still don't know if you went all the way down. It's possible that this kind\nof, whatever consciousness is, and we'll talk about it, is\ngetting the cliche statement of be yourself. It is somehow digging\nat a deeper of reality. But you still don't know\nwhen you get to the bottom. You know, a lot of people,\nthey'll take psychedelic drugs and they'll say, well that\ntakes my mind to certain places where it feels like that is revealing some deeper truth of reality. But you still, it could be\ninterfaces on top of interfaces. In your view of this,\nyou really don't know. I mean it's Godel's incompleteness is that you really don't know. - My own view on it, for what it's worth, 'cause I don't know the right\nanswer, but my own view on it right now is that it's never ending. I think that there will\nnever, that this is great, as I said before, great\njob security for science, and that if this is true, and if consciousness is somehow important or fundamental in the universe, this may be an important fundamental fact about consciousness itself that it's a never ending\nexploration that's going on in some sense. - Well that's interesting. Lemme push back on the job security. So maybe as we understand\nthis kind of idea deeper and deeper, we\nunderstand that the pursuit is not a fruitful one,\nthat maybe we need to, maybe that's why we don't\nsee aliens everywhere. As you get smarter and\nsmarter and smarter, you realize that like exploration is, there's other fun ways to\nspend your time than exploring. You could be sort of living\nmaximally in some way that's not exploration. I could, there's all kinds of\nvideo games you can construct and put yourself inside of them that don't involve you going\noutside of the game world. It's feeling, for my human perspective, what seems to be fun\nis challenging yourself and overcoming those challenges, so you can constantly\nartificially generate challenges for yourself like\nSisyphus and his Boulder. And that's it. So the scientific method\nthat's always reaching out to the stars, that's\nalways trying to figure out the puzzle upon a puzzle, always trying to get to the bottom turtle. Maybe if we can build more and more the intuition that that's\nan infinite pursuit, we agree to start deviating\nfrom that pursuit, start enjoying the here and now versus the looking out\ninto the unknown always. Maybe looking out into the\nunknown is a early activity for a species that's evolved. I'm just sort of saying, pushing back as you probably got a\nlot of scientists excited in terms of job security. I could envision where\nit's not job security, where scientists become\nmore and more useless. Maybe they're like the\nholders of the ancient wisdom that allows us to study our own history, but not much more than that. Just to pushback. - Well, that's good pushback. I'll put one in there\nfor the scientists again. But sure, but then I'll\ntake the other side too. So when Faraday did\nall of his experiments, with magnets and electricity and so forth, he came up with all this\nwonderful empirical data and James Clark Maxwell looked at it and wrote down a few equations, which we can now write\ndown in a single equation. The Maxwell equation, if we\nused geometrical algebra, just one equation. That opened up unbelievable technologies where people are resuming\nand talking to each other around the world, the\nwhole electronics industry. There was something that\ntransformed our lives in a very positive way. With the theories beyond space\ntime, here's one potential. Right now, most of the\ngalaxies that we see, we can see them, but we know\nthat we could never get to them no matter how fast we traveled. They're going away from us at\nthe speed of light or beyond. So we can't ever get to them. So there's all this beautiful real estate that's just smiling and waving at us, and we can never get to it. But that's if we go through space time. But if we recognize that space time is just a data structure,\nit's not fundamental, we're not little things inside space time, space time is a little data\nstructure in our perceptions. It's just the other way around. Once we understand that\nand we get equations for the stuff that's beyond space time, maybe we won't have to\ngo through space time. Maybe we can go around it. Maybe I can go to Proxima\nCentauri and not go through space. I can just go right there directly. If it's a data structure we\ncan start to play with it. So I think that, for what it's worth, my take would be that the\nendless sequence of theories that we could contemplate building will lead to an endless sequence\nof new remarkable insights into the potentialities, the possibilities that would seem miraculous to us. And that we will be motivated to continue the exploration partly just for the technological\ninnovations that come out. But the other thing that\nyou mentioned though, what about just being? What if we decide instead of\nall this doing and exploring, what about being? My guess is that the best\nscientists will do both, and that the act of being will be a place where they get many of their ideas, that they then pull into\nthe conceptual realm. And I think many of the best scientists, Einstein comes to mind, right? Where these guys say, look, I didn't come up with these\nideas by a conceptual analysis. I was thinking in vague images and it was just something non-conceptual. And then it took me a long, long time to pull it out into concepts and then longer to put it into math. But the real insights didn't come from just slavishly\nplaying with equations. They came from a deeper place. And so there may be this\ngoing back and forth between the complete non-conceptual, where there's essentially\nno end to the wisdom, and then conceptual systems where there's the Godel\nlimits that we have to that. And that maybe if\nconsciousness is important and fundamental, that\nmaybe what consciousness, at least part of what\nconsciousness is about, is this discovering itself, discovering its\npossibilities, so to speak. And we can talk about what that might mean by going from the\nnon-conceptual to the conceptual and back and forth. - [Lex] To get better and\nbetter and better at being. - Right. - Let me ask you just, just\nto linger on the evolutionary,"

      "section": "Evolutionary game theory",
      "text": "because you mentioned\nevolutionary game theory and that's really the perspective from which you come to form\nthe case against reality. At which point in our evolutionary history did we start to deviate\nthe most from reality? Is it way before life\neven originated on earth? Is it in the early development\nfrom bacteria and so on? Or is it when some inklings of what we think of as intelligence or maybe even complex\nconsciousness started to emerge? So where did this deviation, just like with the\ninterfaces on in a computer, you know, you start with transistors, and then you have assembly, and then you have C, C++,\nthen you have Python, then you have GUIs and all that kind, you have layers upon layers. When did we start to deviate? - Well, David Maher,\nagain, my advisor at MIT, in his book \"Vision\" suggested that the more primitive sensory\nsystems were less realistic, less vertical. But that by the time you got to something as complicated as the humans, we were actually estimating\nthe true shapes and distances to objects and so forth. So his point of view, and\nI think it was probably, it is not an uncommon\nview among my colleagues that, yeah, the sensory\nsystems of lower creatures may just not be complicated\nenough to give them much truth. But as you get to 86 billion neurons, you can now compute the truth or at least the parts of\nthe truth that we need. When I look at evolutionary game theory, one of my graduate students, Justin Mark, did some simulations\nusing genetic algorithms. So there he was just exploring, we start off with random organisms, random sensory genetics\nand random actions. And first generation was unbelievably, it was a foraging situation. There were foraging for resources, and most of them stayed in one place, didn't do anything important. But we could then just look\nat how the genes evolved, and what we found was, what he found, was that basically you never even saw the truth organisms\neven come on the stage. If they came, they were\ngone in one generation. They just weren't. So they came and gone. They came and went, even\njust in one generation, they just are not good enough. The ones that were just\ntracking their senses, just were tracking the fitness payoffs, were far more fit than the truth seekers. So an answer at one level, I'm gonna give an answer\nat a deeper level, but just with evolutionary game theory. Because my attitude as a scientist is, I don't believe any of our theories. I take them very, very seriously. I study them, I look\nat their implications, but none of them are the gospel. They're just the latest\nideas that we have. And so the reason I study\nevolutionary game theory is because that's the best tool we have right now in this area. There is nothing else that competes. And so as a scientist,\nit's my responsibility to take the best tools\nand see what they mean. And the same thing the\nphysicists are doing, they're taking the best tools and looking at what they entail. But I think that science\nnow has enough experience to realize that we should\nnot believe our theories in the sense that we've now arrived. In 1890, it was a lot of\nphysicists thought we'd arrived, they were discouraging\nbright young students from going into physics,\nbecause it was all done. And that's precisely the wrong attitude. Forever, this is the\nwrong attitude forever. The attitude we should have\nis, a century from now, they'll be looking at us and laughing at what we didn't know. And we just have to assume that\nthat's going to be the case. Just know that everything that we think is so brilliant right now, our\nfinal theory of everything, a century from now, they'll look at us like we\nlook at the physicists of 1890 and go, how could they have been so dumb? So I don't wanna make that mistake. So I'm not doctrinaire about any of our current\nscientific theories. I'm doctrinaire about this, we should use the best\ntools we have right now. That's what we've got. - And with humility. Well, so let me ask you about game theory. I love game theory,\nevolutionary game theory, but I'm always suspicious\nof it, like economics. When you construct models, it's\ntoo easy to construct things that oversimplify just because we, our human brains enjoy the simplification of constructing a few variables that somehow represent\norganisms or represent people. And running a simulation\nthat then allows you to build up intuition. And then it feels really good because you just can get some really deep and surprising intuitions. But how do you know the\nassumptions underlying your models aren't fundamentally flawed? And because of that, your conclusions are fundamentally flawed. So I guess, yes, my question is, what are the limits in\nyour use of game theory, evolutionary game theory,\nyour experience with it, what are the limits of game theory? - So I've gotten some pushback\nfrom professional colleagues and friends who have\ntried to rerun simulations and try to, I mean, the idea\nthat we don't see the truth is not comfortable. And so many of my colleagues\nare very interested in trying to show that we're wrong. And so the idea would be to say that somehow we did something, as you're suggesting,\nmaybe something special that wasn't completely general. We've got some little special\npart of the whole search space and evolutionary game theory in which this happens to be true. But more generally, organisms\nwould evolve to see the truth. So the best pushback we've\ngotten is from a team at Yale. And they suggested that if you use thousands of payoff functions, so we, in our simulations, we just use a couple, one or two. Because it was our first\nsimulations, right? So that would be a limit. We had one or two payoff functions. We showed the result in those, at least for the genetic algorithms. And they said, if you have 20,000 of them, then we can find these conditions in which truth seeing organisms would\nbe the ones that evolved and survived. And so we looked at their simulations, and it certainly is the case\nthat you can find special cases in which truth can evolve. So when I say it's probability zero, it doesn't mean it can't happen. It can happen, in fact, it\ncould happen infinitely often, it's just probability of zero. So probability of zero things\ncan happen infinitely often. - When you say probability of zero, you mean probability close to zero? - To be very precise. So for example, if I have\na unit square on the plane, and I use a probability measure in which the area of a\nregion is this probability, then if I draw a curve\nin that unit square, it has a measure precisely zero. Precisely, not approximately,\nprecisely zero. And yet it has infinitely many points. So there's an object that,\nfor that probability measure, has probability zero, and yet there's infinitely\nmany points in it. So that's what I mean\nwhen I say that the things that are probability zero\ncan happen infinitely often in principle. - Yeah, but infinity, as far as I, and I look outside often, I walk around, and I look at people, I haven't ever seen infinity in real life. - That's an interesting issue. - I've been looking, I've been looking. I don't notice it infinitely\nsmall or the infinitely big. And so the tools of mathematics, you could sort of apply\nthe same kind of criticism, that it is a very convenient\ninterface into our reality. - Well, that's a big\ndebate in mathematics. The intuitionist versus the\nones who take, for example, the real numbers as real. And that's a fun discussion. Nicholas Giesen, a physicist,\nhad really interesting work recently on how if you go\nwith Intuitionist mathematics, you could effectively quantize Newton. And you find that Newtonian\ntheory and quantum theory aren't that different once you go with it. - [Lex] That's funny. - It's really quite interesting. So the issue you raised\nis a very, very deep one, and one that I think we\nshould take quite seriously, which is how should we think about the reality of Contra's\nhierarchy, Aliff one, Aliff two, and all these different infinities versus just a more\nalgorithmic approach, right? So where everything's\ncomputable in some sense, everything's finite. As big as you want, but\nnevertheless finite. - So yeah, that ultimately boils down to whether the world is\ndiscreet or continuous in some general sense. And again, we can't really know, but there's just mind breaking thought, just common sense reasoning\nthat something can happen and yet probability of it happening is 0%. That doesn't compute for\na common sense computer. - Right, this is where you have\nto be a sharp mathematician to really, and I'm not. - Sharp is one word. What I'm saying is\ncommon sense computer is, I mean that in a very,\nkinda in a positive sense, because we've been talking\nabout perception systems and interfaces. If we are to reason about the world, we have to use the best interfaces we got. And I'm not exactly sure that game theory is the best interface we got for this. - [Donald] Oh, right. - And application of\nmathematics tricks and tools in mathematics to game\ntheory is the best we got when we are thinking about\nthe nature of reality, and fitness functions,\nand evolution, period. - Well that's a fair rejoinder. And I think that that was\nthe tool that we used. And if someone says, here's\na better mathematical tool and here's why, this\nmathematical tool better captures the essence of Darwin's idea. John Maynard Smith didn't quite get it with evolutionary game theory. There's this better, this thing. Now there are tools like\nevolutionary graph theory, which generalized\nevolutionary game theory, and then there's quantum game theory. So you can use quantum tools,\nlike entanglement for example, as a resource in games\nthat change the very nature of the solutions, the optimal\nsolutions of the game theory. - Well the work from Yale\nis really interesting. It's a really interesting\nchallenge of kind of these ideas where, okay, if you\nhave a very large number of fitness functions,\nor let's say you have a nearly infinite number\nof fitness functions, or a growing number of fitness functions, what kind of interesting\nthings start emerging? If you are to be an organism,\nif to be an organism that adapts means having to deal with an ensemble of fitness functions. - Right, and so we've actually redone some of our own work based on theirs, and this is the back and forth that we expect in science, right? And what we found was\nthat in their simulations, they were assuming that you\ncouldn't carve the world up into objects. And so we said, well, let's\nrelax that assumption. Allow organisms to create data structures that we might call objects. And an object would be, you would do hierarchical clustering of your fitness payoff functions. The ones that have similar shapes, if you have 20,000 of them, maybe these 50 are all very, very similar. So I can take all the\nperception, action, fitness stuff and make that into a data structure, and we'll call that a unit or an object. And as soon as we did that, then all of their results went away. It turned out they were the special case and that the organisms that\nwere allowed to only see, that were shaped to see\nonly fitness payoffs were the ones that were. So the idea is that objects then, what are objects from an\nevolutionary point of view? This bottle, we thought\nthat when I saw a bottle, it was because I was seeing\na true object that existed whether or not it was perceived. Evolutionary theories suggest\na different interpretation. I'm seeing a data\nstructure that is encoding a convenient way of looking\nat various fitness payoffs. I can use this for drinking, I could use it as a weapon,\nnot a very good one. I could beat someone\nover the head with it. If my goal is mating, this is pointless. So I'm seeing, what I'm coding\nhere is all sorts of actions and the payoffs that I could get. When I pick up an apple,\nnow I'm getting a different set of actions and payoffs. When I pick up a rock I'm getting, so for every object, what I'm getting is a different set of payoff\nfunctions with various actions. And so once you allow that,\nthen what you find is, once again, that truth goes extinct. And the organisms that\njust get an interface are the ones that win. - But the question just sneaking up on, this is fascinating, from where do fitness functions originate? What gives birth to the fitness functions? So if there's a giant black box that just keeps giving\nyou fitness functions, what are we trying to optimize? You said that water has\ndifferent uses than an apple. So there's these objects. What are we trying to optimize and why is not reality\na really good generator of fitness functions? - So each theory makes its own assumptions and says, grant me this,\nthen I'll explain that. So evolutionary game theory says, grant me fitness payoffs, and grant me strategies with payoffs, and I can write down a matrix where this strategy\ninteracts with that strategy, these are the payoffs that come up. If you grant me that, then\nI can start to explain a lot of things. Now you can ask for a\ndeeper question like, okay, how does physics evolve biology? And where do these\nfitness payoffs come from? That's a completely different enterprise. And of course evolutionary\ngame theory then would be not be the right tool for that. It would have to be a deeper tool that shows where evolutionary\ngame theory comes from. My own take is that\nthere's gonna be a problem in doing that because space\ntime isn't fundamental, it's just a user interface. And that the distinction that we make between living and non-living is not a fundamental distinction. It's an artifact of the\nlimits of our interface. So this is a new wrinkle, and\nthis is an important wrinkle. It's so nice to take space\nand time as fundamental because if something\nlooks like it's inanimate, it's it's inanimate, and we\ncan just say it's not living. Now it's much more complicated. Certain things are obviously living. I'm talking with you,\nI'm obviously interacting with some something that's\nalive and conscious. - I think we've let go\nof the word \"obviously\" in this conversation. I think nothing is obvious. - Nothing's obvious, that's right. But when we get down to like\nan ant, it's obviously living, but I'll say it appears to be living. But when we get down to a\nvirus, now people wonder. And when we get down to protons, people say it's not living. And my attitude is, look,\nI have a user interface. Interface is there to hide\ncertain aspects of reality and others to, it's an\nuneven representation, put it that way. Certain things just get completely hidden. Dark matter and dark energy\nare most of the energy and matter that's out there. Our interface just plain\nflat out hides them. The only way we get some hint is because gravitational\nthings are going wrong within our. So most things are\noutside of our interface. The distinction between\nliving and non-living is not fundamental. It's an artifact of our interface. So if we really, really want to understand where evolution comes from, to answer the question, the\ndeep question you asked, I think the right way\nwe're gonna have to do that is to come up with a deeper\ntheory than space time in which there may not\nbe the notion of time. And show that whatever the dynamics of that deeper theory is, and by the way, I'll talk about\nhow you could have dynamics without time, but the dynamics\nof this deeper theory, when we project it in certain ways, then we do get space time, and we get what appears to be evolution by natural selection. So I would love to see\nevolution by natural selection, nature red in tooth and claw, people fighting, animals\nfighting for resources and the whole bit, come\nout of a deeper theory in which perhaps it's all cooperation. There's no limited resources and so forth. But as a result of projection,\nyou get space and time, and as a result of projection, you get nature red in tooth\nand claw, the appearance of it. But it's all an artifact of the interface. - I like this idea that the line between living and\nnon-living is very important. Because that's a thing that would emerge before you have evolution,\nthe idea of death. So that seems to be an important component of natural selection. And if that emerged, because that's also asking the question, I guess, that I ask, where do\nfitness functions come from? That's like asking the old\nmeaning of life question, right? It's what's the why? And one of the big underlying whys, okay, you can start with evolution on earth, but without living,\nwithout life and death, without the line between\nthe living and the dead, you don't have evolution. So what if underneath it, there's no such thing as\nthe living and the dead. Like this concept of an organism, period. There's a living organism that's defined by a volume in space time\nthat somehow interacts, that over time maintains\nits integrity, somehow, has some kind of history,\nit has a wall of some kind. The outside world, the environment, and then inside there's an organism. So you're defining an organism, and also you're defining that organism by the fact that it can move and it can become alive,\nwhich you kind of think of as moving combined with the\nfact that it's keeping itself separate from the environment. So you can point out that thing is living and then it can also die. That seems to be all very\npowerful components of space time that enable you to have\nsomething like natural selection and evolution. - Well, and there's a\nlot of interesting work, some of it by collaborators\nof Carl Friston and others where they have Baysnet kind\nof stuff that they build on. And the notion of a Markov blanket. So you have some states\nwithin this network that are inside the blanket,\nthen you have the blanket, and then the states outside the blanket. And the states inside this Markov blanket are conditionally\nindependent of the states outside the blanket,\nconditioned on the blanket. And what they're looking\nat is that the dynamics inside of the states,\ninside the Markov blanket, seem to be trying to estimate\nproperties of the outside and react to them in a way. So it seems like you're doing\nprobabilistic inferences in ways that might be\nable to keep you alive. So there's interesting work\ngoing on in that direction. But what I'm saying is\nsomething slightly different. And that is like, when I look at you, all I see is skin, hair, and eyes, right? That's all I see. But I know that there's a deeper reality. I believe that there's\na much deeper reality. There's the whole world of your\nexperiences, your thoughts, your hopes, your dreams. In some sense the face that I see is just a symbol that I create, right? And as soon as I look\naway, I delete that symbol, but I don't delete you, I don't delete the conscious experience, the whole world of yours, so I'm only deleting an interface symbol, but that interface symbol\nis a portal, so to speak. Not a perfect portal, but a genuine portal into your beliefs, into your conscious experiences. That's why we can have a conversation. We genuinely, your consciousness\nis genuinely affecting mine and mine is genuinely affecting\nyours through these icons which I create on the fly. I mean I create your face\nwhen I look, I delete it. I don't create you, your consciousness, that's there all the time. But I do. So now, when I look at a cat, I'm creating something\nthat I still call living and I still think is conscious. When I look at an ant, I create something that I still would call living,\nbut maybe not conscious. When I look at something I call a virus, now I'm not even sure\nI would call it living. And when I look at a proton, I would say I don't even think, it's not alive at all. It could be that I'm\nnevertheless interacting with something that's\njust as conscious as you. I'm not saying the proton is conscious. The face that I'm creating\nwhen I look at you, that face is not conscious. That face is a data structure in me. That face, it's an experience. It's not an experiencer. Similar, the proton is something\nthat I create when I look or do a collision in the\nLarge Hadron Collider or something like that. But what is behind the\nentity in space time? So I've got this space time interface, and I just got this entity\nthat I call a proton. What is the reality behind it? Well, the physicists are finding\nthese big, big structures, amplituhedron, associohedron. What's behind those\ncould be consciousness, what I'm playing with. In which case, when I'm\ninteracting with a proton, I'm could be interacting\nwith consciousness. Again, to be very, very clear, 'cause it's easy to misunderstand, I'm not saying a proton is conscious, just like I'm not saying\nyour face is conscious. Your face is a symbol I create\nand then delete as I look. And so your face is not conscious, but I know that that face in my interface, the Lex Fridman face that I\ncreate is an interface symbol that's a genuine portal\ninto your consciousness. The portal is less clear for a cat, even less clear for an ant. And by the time we get down to a proton, the portal is not clear at all. But that doesn't mean I'm not interacting with consciousness, it just\nmeans my interface gave up and there's some deeper reality that we have to go after. So your question really\nforces out a big part of this whole approach\nthat I'm talking about. - So it's this portal to\nconscious, I wonder why you can't, your portal is not as good to a cat, to a cat's consciousness\nthan it is to a human. Does it have to do with\nthe fact that you're human and just similar organisms, organisms of similar complexity\nare able to create portals better to each other? Or is it just as you get\nmore and more complex, you get better and better portals? - Well, let me answer one aspect of it that I'm more confident about,\nthen I'll speculate on that. Why is it that the portal\nis so bad with protons, and elementary particles more generally? So quarks, leptons, and\ngluons and so forth. Well, the reason for that is because those are just symmetries of space time, more technically the\nirreducible representations of the point gray group of space time. So they're just literally representations of the data structure of\nspace time that we're using. So that's why they're\nnot very much insightful. They're just almost entirely tied to the data structure itself. There's not much, they're telling you only something\nabout the data structure, not behind the data structure. It's only when we get to higher levels that we're starting to, in some sense build portals to what's behind space time. - Sure, yeah. So there's more and more complexity built on top of the interface\nof space time with the cat. - [Donald] So you can actually\nbuild a portal, right? - Yeah, right. This interface of face\nand hair and so on, skin, there is some syncing going\non between humans though, where we sync, like you're getting a pretty good representation\nof the ideas in my head, and starting to get a foggy view of my memories in my head. Even though this is the\nfirst time we're talking, you start to project your own memories. You start to solve like a\ngiant hierarchy of puzzles about a human, 'cause we're all, there's\na lot of similarities. A lot of it rhymes. So you start to make a lot of inferences and you build up this model of a person. You have a pretty sophisticated model of what's going on underneath. Again, I just, I wonder if it's possible to construct these models about each other and nevertheless be very distant\nfrom an underlying reality. - Yes, there's a lot of work on this. So there's some interesting\nwork called signaling games where they look at how\npeople can coordinate and come to communicate. There's some interesting\nwork that was done by some colleagues and friends of mine, Louis Narins, Natalia\nCamarova, and Kimberly Jameson, where they were looking\nat evolving color words. So you have a circle of\ncolors, so the color circle. And they wanted to see if they\ncould get people to cooperate in how they carved the color\ncircle up into units of words. And so they had a game\ntheoretic kind of thing that they'd had people do. And what they found was\nthat when they included, so most people are trichromats, you have three kinds\nof cone photoreceptors, but there are some, a lot of men, 7% of men have are dichromats. They might be missing the\nred cone photoreceptor. They found that the dichromats\nhad an outsized influence on the final ways that\nthe whole space of colors was carved up and labels attached. You needed to be able to include the Dichromats in the conversation, and so they had a bigger\ninfluence on how you made the boundaries of the language. And I thought that was a really\ninteresting kind of insight that there's going to be, again, a game, perhaps a game, or evolutionary,\nor genetic algorithm kind of thing that goes on in terms of learning to communicate\nin ways that are useful. And so, yeah, you can use game theory to actually explore\nthat, or signaling games. There's a lot of brilliant work on that. I'm not doing it, but\nthere's work out there. - So if it's okay, let\nus tackle once more, and perhaps several more times after,"

      "section": "Consciousness",
      "text": "the big topic of consciousness. This very beautiful, powerful thing that perhaps is the thing\nthat makes us human. What is it? What's the role of consciousness in, let's say even just the thing\nwe've been talking about, which is the formation of this interface? Any kind of ways you want to kind of start talking about it? - Well, let me say first what\nmost of my colleagues say. 99% are, again, assuming that\nspace time is fundamental, particles in space time,\nmatter is fundamental, and most are reductionist. And so the standard\napproach to consciousness is to figure out what\ncomplicated systems of matter with the right functional\nproperties could possibly lead to the emergence of consciousness. That's the general idea, right? So maybe you have to have neurons, maybe only if you have neurons, but that might not be enough. They have to certain kinds of complexity in their organization and their dynamics. Certain kind of network\nabilities, for example. So there are those who say for example that consciousness arises\nfrom orchestrated collapse of quantum states, of\nmicrotubules in neurons. So this is Hamrov and\nPenrose have this kind of. So it's, you start with\nsomething physical, a physical property of\nquantum states of neurons, of microtubules and neurons. And you say that somehow an\norchestrated collapse of those is consciousness or conscious experiences. Or integrated information theory. Again, you start with something physical, and if it has the right kind\nof functional properties with something they call phi, with the right kind of\nintegrated information, then you have consciousness. Or you can be a panpsychist,\nPhilip Goff for example, where you might say, well, in addition to the\nparticles in space and time, those particles are not just matter. They also could have say\na unit of consciousness. And so, but once again,\nyou're taking space and time and particles as fundamental, and you're adding a new property to them, see consciousness. And then you have to talk about how, where a proton and electron\nget together to form hydrogen, then how those consciousnesses\nmerge or interact to create the consciousness\nof hydrogen so forth. There's a tension schema\ntheory, which again, this is how neural network processes representing to the network itself its intentional processes. That could be consciousness. There's global workspace theory, and neuronal global workspace theory. So there's many, many\ntheories of this type. What's common to all\nof them is they assume that space time is fundamental. They assume that physical processes in space time is fundamental. Panpsychism adds consciousness\nas an additional thing, it's almost dualist in that regard. And my attitude is our\nbest science is telling us that space time is not fundamental. So why is that important here? Well, for centuries deep thinkers thought of earth, air, fire, and water as the fundamental elements. It was a reductionist kind of idea. Nothing was more elemental than those. And you could sort of build\neverything up from those. When we got the periodic\ntable of elements, we realized that, of course\nwe want to study earth, air, fire, and water. There's combustion science for fire. There's sciences for\nall these other things, water and so forth. So we're gonna do\nscience for these things. But fundamental, no, no, if you're looking for\nsomething fundamental, those are the wrong building blocks. Earth has many, many\ndifferent kinds of elements that project into the one\nthing that we call earth. If you don't understand\nthat there's silicon, that there's iron, that\nthere's all these different kinds of things that project\ninto what we call earth, you're hopelessly lost, you're not fundamental,\nyou're not gonna get there. And then after the periodic table, then we came up with\nquarks, leptons, and gluons, the particles of the\nstandard model of physics. And so we actually now know that if you really want\nto get fundamental, the periodic table isn't\nit, it's good for chemistry, and it's just wonderful for chemistry. But if you're trying\nto go deep fundamental, what is the fundamental science? That's not it. You're gonna have to go to\nquarks, leptons, and gluons and so forth. Well now we've discovered\nspace time itself is doomed. Quarks, leptons, and gluons are just irreducible representations of the symmetries of space time. So the whole framework on\nwhich consciousness research is being based right now is doomed. And for me, these are my\nfriends and colleagues that are doing this, they're brilliant. They're brilliant. My feeling is, I'm so\nsad that they're stuck with this old framework, because if they weren't\nstuck like with earth, air, fire, and water, you could\nactually make progress. So it doesn't matter how smart you are, if you start with earth,\nair, fire, and water, you're not gonna get anywhere, right? - Can I actually, just 'cause the word\n\"doomed\" is so interesting. Lemme give you some options. Multiple choice quiz. Is space time, we could say is reality, the way we perceive it,\ndoomed, wrong, or fake? Because doomed just means\nit could still be right and we're now ready to go deeper. - [Donald] It would be that. - So it's not wrong, it's not a complete\ndeviation from a journey toward the truth. - Right, it's like earth, air,\nfire, and water is not wrong. There is earth, air, fire, and water. That's a useful framework,\nbut it's not fundamental. - Well, there's also wrong,\nwhich is they used to believe, as I recently learned, that George Washington, the first president of the\nUnited States, was bled to death for something that could\nhave been easily treated because it was believed that you can get, actually I need to look into this further, but I guess you get\ntoxins out or demons out. I don't know what you're getting out with the bleeding of a person. But, so that ended up being wrong, but widely believed as a medical tool. So it's also possible that\nour assumption of space time is not just doomed, but it's wrong. - Well, if we believe that\nit's fundamental, that's wrong. But if we believe it's a\nuseful tool, that's right. - But bleeding somebody to death was believed to be a useful tool. - [Donald] That was wrong. - It wasn't just not fundamental, it was very, I'm sure there's cases in which bleeding somebody would work, but it would be a very tiny,\ntiny, tiny percentage of cases. So it could be that it's wrong, like it's a side road that's ultimately leading to a dead end, as opposed to a truck stop or something that you can get off of. - My feeling is not the\ndead end kind of thing. I think that what the\nphysicists are finding is that there are these\nstructures beyond space time, but they project back into space time. And so space time, when they say space time is\ndoomed, they're explicit. They're saying it's doomed in the sense that we\nthought it was fundamental. It's not fundamental. It's a useful, absolutely useful and brilliant data structure. But there are deeper data structures, like cosmological polytopes, and space time is not fundamental. What is doomed, in the\nsense that it's wrong, is reductionism, - Which is saying space time\nis fundamental, essentially. - Right, the idea that\nthat somehow being smaller in space and time, or space time, is a fundamental nature of reality. That's just wrong. It turned out to be a useful heuristic for thermodynamics and so forth and several other places. Reductionism has been very useful, but that's, in some sense, an artifact of how we use our interface. - Yeah, so you're saying\nsize doesn't matter. Okay, this is very important\nfor me to write down. Ultimately. - Ultimately, I mean it's useful for theories like thermodynamics and also for understanding brain networks in terms of individual neurons, and neurons in terms of\nchemical systems inside cells. That's all very, very useful. But the idea that we're\ngetting to the more fundamental nature of reality, no. When you get all the way\ndown in that direction, you get down to the quarks and gluons, and what you realize is\nwhat you've gotten down to is not fundamental reality, just the irreducible\nrepresentations of a data structure. That's all you've gotten down to. So you're always stuck\ninside the data structure. So you seem to be getting\ncloser and closer. I mean, I went from neural\nnetworks to neurons, neurons to chemistry,\nchemistry to particles, particles to quarks and gluons. I'm getting closer and\ncloser to the reality. No, I'm getting closer and\ncloser to the actual structure of the data structure of space and time, the irreducible representations. That's what you're getting closer to, not to a deeper understanding\nof what's beyond space time. - We'll return again to\nthis question of dynamics, because you keep saying\nthat space time is doomed, but mostly focusing on\nthe space part of that, it's very interesting to see\nwhy time gets the bad cred too. Because how do you have\ndynamics without time is the thing I'd love to talk\nto you a little bit about. But let us return your\nbrilliant whirlwind overview of the different theories of consciousness that are out there. What is consciousness if\noutside of space time? - If we think that we want to\nhave a model of consciousness, we as scientists then have to say, what do we want to write down? What kind of mathematical\nmodel are we gonna write down? And if you think about\nit, there's lots of things that you might wanna write\ndown about consciousness. Fairly complicated subject. So most of my colleagues are saying, let's start with matter or neurons and see what properties of matter could create consciousness. But I'm saying that\nthat whole thing is out, space time is doomed,\nthat whole thing is out. We need to look at\nconsciousness qua consciousness. In other words, not as\nsomething that arises in space and time, but\nperhaps it's something that creates space and\ntime as a data structure. So what do we want? And here again, there's\nno hard and fast rule, but what you as a scientist\nhave to do is to pick what you think are the minimal assumptions that are gonna allow you to\nboot up a comprehensive theory. That is the trick. So what do I want? So what what I chose to do\nwas to have three things. I said that there are\nconscious experiences, feeling of headache, the smell of garlic, experiencing the color red. Those are conscious. So that's a primitive of the theory. And the reason I want few primitives, why? Because those are the\nmiracles of the theory, right? The primitives, the\nassumptions of the theory are the things you're\nnot going to explain. Those are the things you assume. - And those experiences\nyou particularly mean there's a subjectiveness to them. - [Donald] That's right. - It's the thing when people refer to the hard problem of consciousness is it feels like something\nto look at the color red. - Exactly right. It feels like something to have a headache or to feel upset to your stomach, it feels like something. So I'm going to grant that in this theory, there are experiences and they're\nfundamental in some sense. So conscious experience. So they're not derived from physics, they're not functional\nproperties of particles. They are sui generis. They exist. Just like we assume space time exists, I'm now saying space time\nis just a data structure. It doesn't exist independent. Conscious experiences exist. - Sorry to interrupt once again, but should we be focusing in\nyour thinking on humans alone? Or is there something about, in relation to other kinds of organisms that have a sufficiently\nhigh level of complexity? Or is there some kind of generalization of the panpsychist idea that consciousness permeates all matter outside of the usual\ndefinition of what matter is inside space time? - So it's beyond human consciousness. Human consciousness from\nmy point of view would be one of a countless\nvariety of consciousness. And even within human consciousness, there's countless variety\nof consciousness within us. I mean, you have your\nleft and right hemisphere, and apparently if you\nsplit the corpus collosum, the personality of the left hemisphere, and the religious beliefs\nof the left hemisphere, can be very different\nfrom the right hemisphere. And their conscious\nexperiences can be disjointed. One could have one conscious experience. They can play 20 questions. The left hemisphere can\nhave an idea in its mind, and the right hemisphere has to guess, and it might not get it. So even within you it's more\nthan just one consciousness. It's lots of consciousnesses. So the general theory of consciousness that I'm after is not\njust human consciousness. It's going to be just consciousness, and I presume human\nconsciousness is a tiny drop in the bucket of the infinite\nvariety of consciousness. - That said, I should clarify that the black hole of\nconsciousness is the home cat. I'm pretty sure cats lack\nthe embodiment of evil and lack all capacity for\nconsciousness or compassion. So I just wanna lay that on the table, but that's a theory I'm working. I don't have any good evidence. - The black cat. - That's just a shout out\nto, sorry to distract. So that's the first assumption. - The first assumption. The second assumption is\nthat these experiences have consequences. So I'm going to say that\nconscious experiences can trigger other conscious\nexperiences somehow. So really in some sense\nthere's two basic assumptions. - So there's some kind of causality, there is a chain of causality. Does this relate to dynamics? - I'll say there's a\nprobabilistic relationship. And then, so I'm trying\nto be as non-specific to begin with and see where it leads me. So what I can write down\nare probability spaces, so probability space, which contains the conscious experiences that this consciousness can have. So I call this a conscious\nagent, this technical thing. Annaka Harris and I've talked about this, and she rightly cautions\nme that people will think that I'm bringing in a\nnotion of a self or agency and so forth when I say conscious agent. So I just wanna say that I\nuse the term conscious agent merely as a technical term. There is no notion of self\nin my fundamental definition of a conscious agent. There are only experiences and\nprobabilistic relationships of how they trigger other experiences. - So the agent is the generator\nof the conscious experience? - The agent is a mathematical structure that includes a probability\nmeasure, a probability space of possible conscious experiences, and a markovian kernel,\nwhich describes how, if this agent has certain\nconscious experiences, how that will affect the experiences of other conscious\nagents, including itself. - [Lex] But you don't\nthink of that as a self. - No, there is no notion of a self here. There's no notion of really of an agent. - But is there a locality? Is there an organism?\n- [Donald] There's no space. So these are conscious\nunits, conscious entities. - [Lex] But they're distinct in some way, 'cause they have to interact? - Well, so here's the interesting thing. When we write down the mathematics, when you have two of these\nconscious agents interacting, the pair satisfy a definition\nof a conscious agent. So they are a single conscious agent. So there is one conscious agent. But it it has a nice\nanalytic decomposition into as many conscious agents as you wish. - So that's a nice interface. - It it's a very useful\nscientific interface. It's a scale free, or if you like, a fractal-like approach to it in which we can use the\nsame unit of analysis at all scales in studying consciousness. But if I want to talk about, so there's no notion of learning, memory, problem solving,\nintelligence, self, agency. So none of that is fundamental. And the reason I did that\nwas because I want to assume as little as possible. Everything I assume is\na miracle in the theory. It's not something you explain,\nit's something you assume. So I have to build networks\nof conscious agents. If I wanna have a notion of a\nself, I have to build a self. I have to build learning,\nmemory, problem solving, intelligence and planning,\nall these different things. I have to build networks of\nconscious agents to do that. It's a trivial theorem that\nnetworks of conscious agents are computationally\nuniversal, that's trivial. So anything that we can\ndo with neural networks or automata you can do with\nnetworks of conscious agents, that's trivial. But you can also do more, the events in the probability\nspace need not be computable. So the Markovian dynamics\nis not restricted to computable functions, because the very events\nthemselves need not be computable. So this can capture any computable theory, anything we can do with neural networks, we can do with conscious agent networks. But it leaves open the\ndoor for the possibility of non-computable interactions\nbetween conscious agents. So we have to, if we\nwant a theory of memory, we have to build it. And there's lots of different\nways you could build. We've actually got a paper, Chris Fields took the lead on this, and we have a paper called\n\"Conscious Agent Networks\" where Chris takes the lead and shows how to use these\nnetworks of conscious agents to build memory and to build\nprimitive kinds of learning. - But can you provide some intuition of what conscious networks,\nnetworks of conscious agents helps you, first of all,\nwhat that looks like. And I don't just mean mathematically, of course maybe that might\nhelp build up intuition, but how that helps us potentially solve the hard problem of consciousness? Or is that baked in that that exists? Can you solve the hard\nproblem of consciousness, why it tastes delicious when\nyou eat a delicious ice cream, with networks of conscious agents? Or is that taken as an assumption? - So the standard way the\nhard problem is thought of is we're assuming space\nand time and particles, or neurons for example, these are just physical things\nthat have no consciousness. And we have to explain how\nthe conscious experience of the taste of chocolate\ncould emerge from those. So that's the typical hard\nproblem of consciousness is that problem, right? How do you boot up the taste of chocolate, the experience or the taste of\nchocolate from neurons, say, or the right kind of artificial\nintelligence circuitry? How do you boot that up? That's typically what the\nhard problem of consciousness means to researchers. Notice that I'm changing the problem. I'm not trying to boot\nup conscious experiences from the dynamics of neurons or silicon or something like that. I'm saying that that's the wrong problem. My hard problem would go\nin the other direction. If I start with conscious experiences, how do I build up space and time? How do I build up what I\ncall the physical world? How do I build up what we call brains? Because I'm saying\nconsciousness is not something that brains do. Brains are something that\nconsciousness makes up. It is among the experience, it's an ephemeral\nexperience in consciousness. I look inside, so to be\nvery, very clear right now, I have no neurons. If you looked, you would see neurons. That's a data structure that\nyou would create on the fly. And it's a very useful one. As soon as you look away, you garbage collect that data structure. Just like that Necker cube\nthat I was talking about on the piece of paper, when you look, you see a 3D\ncube, you create it on the fly. As soon as you look away, that's gone. - [Lex] When you say you, you\nmean a human being scientist. - Right now, that's right. More generally it'll be conscious agents, because as you pointed out, am I asking for a theory of\nconscience only about humans? No, it's consciousness, which human consciousness\nis just a tiny sliver. - So, but you are saying that there is, that's a useful data structure. How many other data structures are there? That's why I said you, human. If there's another earth, if there's another alien civilization doing these kinds of investigations, would they come up with\nsimilar data structures? - [Donald] Probably not. - What is the space of data structures, I guess is what I'm asking. - My guess is that if\nconsciousness is fundamental, if consciousness is all there is, then the only thing that\nmathematical structure can be about is possibilities\nof consciousness. And that suggests to\nme that there could be an infinite variety of consciousnesses and a vanishingly small fraction of them use space time data structures and the kinds of structures that we use. There's an infinite\nvariety of data structures. Now this is very similar to something that Max Tegmark has said,\nbut I wanna distinguish it. He has his level four multiverse idea. He thinks that mathematics is fundamental. And so that's the fundamental reality, and since there's an infinite variety, endless variety of\nmathematical structures, there's an infinite variety\nof multiverses in his view. I'm saying something similar in spirit, but importantly different. There's an infinite variety\nof mathematical structures. Absolutely. But mathematics isn't\nthe fundamental reality in this framework, consciousness is. And mathematics is to consciousness like bones are to an\norganism, you need the bones. So mathematics is not\ndivorced from consciousness, but it's not the entirety of\nconsciousness by any means. And so there's an infinite\nvariety of consciousnesses and signaling games that\nconsciousnesses could interact via and therefore worlds, common worlds, data structures that they\ncan use to communicate. So space and time is just\none of an infinite variety. And so I think that\nwhat we'll find is that as we go outside of our\nlittle space time bubble, we will encounter utterly alien forms of conscious experience that we may not be able\nto really comprehend in the following sense. If I ask you to imagine a color that you've never seen\nbefore, does anything happen? Nothing happens, right? - [Lex] Yeah, no. - Nothing happens. And that's just one color, I'm asking for just one color. We actually know, by the way, that there apparently there\nare women called Tetrafems who have four color\nreceptors, not just three. And Kimberly Jameson and\nothers who studied these women have good evidence that\nthey apparently have a new dimension of color experience that the rest of us don't have. So these women are apparently\nliving in a world of color that you and I can't\neven concretely imagine. No man can imagine them. And yet they're real color experiences. And so in that sense, I'm saying, now take that little baby step. Oh, there are women who\nhave color experiences that I could never have. Whoa, that's shocking. Now take that infinite, there are consciousness where every aspect of their experiences\nis like that new color. It's something utterly alien to you. You have nothing like that. And yet these are all possible varieties of conscious experience. - When you say there's\na lot of consciousness, is a singular consciousness\nbasically the set of possible experiences you can\nhave in that subjective way? As opposed to the underlying mechanism. Because you say that having\na extra color receptor, ability to have new experiences, that's somehow a different consciousness. Is there a way to see that as\nall the same consciousness, the subjectivity itself? - Right, because when we have two of these conscious agents\ninteracting, mathematics, they actually satisfy the\ndefinition of a conscious agent. So in fact, they are a\nsingle conscious agent. So in fact, one way to\nthink about what I'm saying, I'm postulating with my colleagues, Jayton and Chris and others,\nRobert Brentner and so forth. There is one big conscious\nagent, infinitely complicated. But fortunately we can,\nfor analytic purposes, break it down all the\nway to, in some sense, the simplest conscious agent, which has one conscious experience, one. This one agent can experience red 35. That's it. That's what it experiences. You can get all the way down to that. - So you think it's\npossible that consciousness, whatever that is, is fundamental, or at least much more in the\ndirection of the fundamental than is space time as we perceive it. - That's the proposal. And therefore what I have to do in terms of the hard\nproblem of consciousness is to show how dynamical\nsystems of conscious agents could lead to what we call\nspace, and time, and neurons, and brain activity. In other words, we have to\nshow how you get space time and physical objects\nentirely from a theory of conscious agents outside of space time with the dynamics outside of space time. And I can tell you how we plan to do that. But that's the idea. - The magic of it, that\nchocolate is delicious. So there's a mathematical kind of thing that we could say here, how it\ncan emerge within the system of networks of conscience agents. But is there going to be,\nat the end of the proof, why chocolate is so delicious? Or no, I guess I'm going to ask different kinds of dumb\nquestions to try to sneak up. - Sure, oh, well that's\nthe right question. And when I say that I\ntook conscious experiences as fundamental, what that means is, in the current version of my theory, I'm not explaining conscious experiences where they came from. That's the miracle. That's one of the miracles. So I have two miracles in my theory. There are conscious experiences, like the taste of chocolate, and that there's a\nprobabilistic relationship. When certain conscious experiences occur, others are more likely to occur. Those are the two miracles that. - It's possible to get beyond that and somehow start to chip\naway at the miracle-ness of that miracle that\nchocolate is still delicious. - I hope so. I've got my hands full with\nwhat I'm doing right now. But I can just say a top level how I would think about that. That would get at this, consciousness without form. This is gonna be really,\nthis is really tough, because it's consciousness without form versus the various forms\nthat consciousness takes for the experiences that it has. - [Lex] Right, right. - So when I write down a probability space for these conscious experiences, I say, here's a probability space for the possible conscious\nexperiences, right? It's just like when I write\ndown a probability space for an experiment, like I'm\ngonna flip a coin twice, right? And I want to look at the\nprobability of various outcomes. So I have to write down\na probability space. There could be heads heads, heads tails, tails heads, tails tails. So before, as any class in\nprobability you're told, write down your probability space. If you don't write down\nyour probability space, you can't get started. So here's my probability\nspace for consciousness. How do I wanna interpret that structure? The structure is just sitting there, there's gonna be a dynamics\nthat happens on it. Experiences appear and then disappear, just like heads appears and disappears. So one way to think about that\nfundamental probability space is that corresponds to\nconsciousness without any content. The infinite consciousness that transcends any particular content. - Well, do you think of that\nas a mechanism, as a thing? Like the rules that govern\nthe dynamics of the thing outside of space time, isn't that, if you think conscious is fundamental, isn't that essentially getting like, it is solving the hard\nproblem, which is like from where does this thing pop up, which is the mechanism\nof the thing popping up. Whatever the consciousness is, the different kinds and\nso on, that mechanism. And also, the question I wanna ask is how tricky do you think\nit is to solve that problem? You solved a lot of difficult problems throughout the history of humanity. There's probably more\nproblems to solve left than we've solved by like an infinity. But along that long journey\nof intelligent species, when will we solve this consciousness? Which is one way to measure\nthe difficulty of the problem. - So I'll give two answers. There's one problem I think we can solve but we haven't solved yet. And that is the reverse\nof what my colleagues call the hard problem. The problem of how do you start\nwith conscious experiences, in the way that I've just\ndescribed them and the dynamics, and build up space and time and brains? That I think is a tough technical problem, but it's in principle solvable. So I think we can solve that. So we would solve the hard problem, not by showing how brains\ncreate consciousness, but how networks of conscious agents create what we call the\nsymbols that we call brains. So that, I think. - But does that allow you\nto, so that's interesting. That's an interesting idea. Consciousness creates the brain, not the brain creates consciousness, but does that allow\nyou to build the thing? - My guess is that it will\nenable unbelievable technologies, and I'll tell you why. I think it plugs into the work that the physicists are doing. So this theory of consciousness\nwill be even deeper than the structures that\nthe physicists are finding, like the amplituhedron. But the other answer to your\nquestion is less positive. As I said earlier, I think\nthat there is no such thing as a theory of everything. So that I think that the theory\nthat my team is working on, this conscious agent theory\nis just a 1.0 theory. We're using probability\nspaces and markovian kernels. I can easily see people now saying, well, we can do better if we\ngo to category theory, and we can get a deeper,\nperhaps more interesting. And then someone will say, well now I'll go to topoid theory, and so I imagine that\nthere'll be conscious agents, 5, 10, 3 trillion point 0, but I think it will never end. I think ultimately this question that we sort of put our fingers on of, how does the formless give birth to form? To the taste, the wonderful\ntaste of chocolate? I think that we will always\ngo deeper and deeper, but we will never solve that. That in some sense, that\nwill be a primitive. I hope I'm wrong. Maybe it's just the limits\nof my current imagination. So I'll just say, my imagination right now doesn't peer that deep. So I don't, by the way I'm saying this, I don't want to discourage\nsome brilliant 20-year-old who then later on proves me dead wrong. I hope to be proven dead wrong. - Well, just like you\nsaid, a century from now, everything we're saying now,\neverything you're saying, all your theories will be laughing stock. They will respect the\npuzzle solving abilities and how much we're able\nto do with so little. But outside of that it will all be just, the silliness will be\nentertainment for a teenager. - Especially the silliness when we thought that we were\nso smart and we knew it all. - So it would be interesting\nto explore your ideas by contrasting, you\nmentioned Annaka Harris, you mentioned Philip Goff. So outside of, if you're\nnot allowed to say the fundamental disagreement is the fact that space\ntime is fundamental, what are interesting distinctions between ideas of consciousness, between you and Annaka for example? You guys have been on a podcast together. I'm sure in private you guys have some incredible conversations. So where are some\ninteresting sticking points, some interesting disagreements, let's say, with with Annaka first? Maybe there'll be a few other people. - Well, Annaka and I just had\na conversation this morning where we were talking about our ideas, and what we discovered\nreally in our conversation was that we're pretty\nmuch on the same page. It was really just terminology\nabout consciousness. Yeah, our ideas about consciousness are pretty much on the same page. She rightly has cautioned me to, when I talk about conscious agents, to point out that the notion of agency is not fundamental in my theory, the notion of self is not fundamental. And that's absolutely true. I can use this network\nof conscious agents, and I now use as a technical term. Conscious agents is a technical term for that probability space\nwith the Markovian dynamics. I can use that to build models of a self and to build models of agency. But they're not fundamental. So she has really been very helpful in helping me to be a little\nbit clear about these ideas and not say things that are misleading. - The word, I mean, this\nis the interesting thing about language actually, is that language, quite obviously, is an interface to truth. It's so fascinating that individual words can have so much ambiguity, and that the specific choices of a word within a particular sentence, within the context of a sentence, can have such a difference in meaning. It's quite fascinating, especially when you're talking about topics like consciousness, because it's a very loaded term. It means a lot of things\nto a lot of people. And the entire concept\nis shrouded a mystery. So combination of the fact\nthat it's a loaded term and that there's a lot of mystery, people can just interpret\nit in all kinds of ways. And so you have to be both precise and help them avoid getting stuck on some kind of side\nroad of miscommunication, lost in translation because\nyou used the wrong word. That's interesting. I mean, because for a lot of people, consciousness is ultimately\nconnected to self. I mean, our experience\nof consciousness is very, it's connected to this ego. I mean, I just, I mean, what\nelse could it possibly be? How do you begin to\ncomprehend, to visualize, to conceptualize a consciousness that's not connected to like\nthis particular organism? - Well, I have a way of thinking about this whole problem now that comes outta this\nframework that's different. So we can imagine a\ndynamics of consciousness, not in space and time, just abstractly. It could be cooperative for all we know. It could be very friendly, I don't know. And you can set up a\ndynamics, a Markovian dynamics that is so-called stationary, and that's a technical term, which means that the entropy\neffectively is not increasing. There is some entropy, but it's constant. So there's no increasing entropy. And in that sense, the\ndynamics is timeless. There is no entropic time. But it's a trivial theorem. Three line proof that if you have a stationary Markovian dynamics, any projection that you\nmake of that dynamics, by conditional probability. And if you want, I can state even more mathematically precisely for some readers or listeners. But if any projection you take\nby conditional probability, the induced image of that markov chain will have increasing entropy. You'll have entropic time. So I'll be very, very precise. I have a markov chain X1, X2, through XN, where N goes to infinity. The entropy H, capital H, of XN is equal to the entropy\nH of XN-1 for all N. So the entropy is the same, but it's a theorem that H\nof XN, say given X sub one, is greater than or equal\nto H of XN-1 given X1. - [Lex] Sure, where does\nthe greater come from? - Because, well the theorem,\nthe three line proof, H of XN given X1 is greater than or equal to H of XN given X1 and X2. Because conditioning reduces. But then H of XN minus one given X1, X2 is equal to H of XN-1 given X2, by the markov property. And then because it's stationary, it's equal to H of X. I have to write it down. - [Lex] Yeah, sure, sure. - I have to write it, anyway,\nthere's a three line proof. - But the assumption of stationarity, we're using a lot of terms\nthat people won't understand. Doesn't matter. So there's some kind of,\nso Markovian dynamics is basically trying to\nmodel some kind of system with some probabilities,\nand there's agents, and they interact in some kind of way, and you can say something\nabout that system as it evolves. So stationary system is one\nthat has certain properties in terms of entropy. Very well, but we don't know if\nit's stationary or not. We don't know what the properties, so you have to kind of take assumptions and see, okay, well what\ndoes the systems behave like under these different properties? The more constraints, the\nmore assumptions you take, the more predictive, the more interesting, powerful things you can say. But sometimes they're limiting. That said, we're talking\nabout consciousness here. How does that, you said\ncooperative, okay, competitive. I like chocolate. I'm sitting here, I have a\nbrain, I'm wearing a suit. It sure as hell feels like I'm myself. What, am I tuning in? Am I plugging into something? Am I a projection, a simple trivial\nprojection into space time from some much larger organism that I can't possibly comprehend? How the hell? You're saying, you're building\nup mathematical intuitions. Fine, great. But I'm just, I'm having\nan existential crisis here, and I'm gonna die soon. We'll all die pretty quickly. So I wanna figure out why\nchocolate's so delicious. So help me out here. So let's just keep sneaking up to this. - Right, so the whole technical thing was to say this, even if the\ndynamics of consciousness is stationary, so that\nthere is no entropic time. Any projection of it, any view of it will have the artifact of entropic time. That's a limited resource. Limited resources, so that\nthe fundamental dynamics may have no limits, limited\nresources whatsoever. Any projection will have certainly time as a limited resource, and probably lots of\nother limited resources. Hence, we could get\ncompetition, and evolution, and nature red in tooth and claw as an artifact of a deeper system in which those aren't fundamental. And in fact, I take it as\nsomething that this theory must do at some point, is to show how\nnetworks of conscious agents, even if they're not resource limited, give rise to evolution\nby natural selection via a projection. - Yeah, but you're saying,\nI'm trying to understand how the limited resources\nthat give rise to, so first the thing gives rise to time, that gives rise to the limited resource, that gives rise to evolution\nby natural selection. How that has to do with the fact that chocolate is delicious. - Well, it is not gonna do that directly. It's gonna get to this notion of self. - Oh, it's gonna give you. - [Donald] The notion of self. - Oh, the evolution gives\nyou the notion of self. - And also of a self\nseparate from other selves. So the idea would be. - Has a competition, has life and death and all those kinds of things - That's right. So it won't, I don't think, as I said, I don't think that I can tell you how the formless gives rise to\nthe experience of chocolate. Right now my current theory says that's one of the miracles I'm assuming. So my theory can't do it. And the reason my theory can't do it is because Hoffman's brain\ncan't do it right now. But the notion of self, yes. The notion of self can be an\nartifact of the projection. So there's one conscious agent. Because anytime conscious agents interact, they form a new conscious agent. So there's one conscious agent. Any projection of that one conscious agent gives rise to time, even\nif there wasn't any time in that one conscious agent. And it gives rise, I want to,\nnow, I haven't proven this, so now this is me guessing\nwhere the theory's gonna go. I haven't done this, there's\nno paper on this yet. So now I'm speculating. My guess is I'll be able to show, or my brighter colleagues working with me will be able to show, that we will get evolution\nof a natural selection, the notion of individual selves, individual physical objects and so forth, coming out as a projection of this thing. And that the self, this then\nwill be really interesting in terms of how it starts to interact with certain spiritual traditions, right? Where they will say that\nthere is a notion of self that needs to be let go,\nwhich is this finite self that's competing with other\nselves to get more money and prestige and so forth. That self in some sense has to die. But there's a deeper self,\nwhich is the timeless being that precedes, not precludes, but precedes any particular conscious experiences. The ground of all experience. That there's that notion\nof a deep capital self. But our little Lowercase S selves could be artifacts of projection. And it may be that what\nconsciousness is doing in this framework is it's\nprojected itself down into a self that calls itself Don and a self that calls itself Lex. And through conversations like this, it's trying to find out about itself, and eventually transcend the\nlimits of the Don and Lex little icons that it's using. And that little projection of itself, through this conversation, is somehow, it's learning about itself. - So that thing dressed me up today in order to understand itself. - And in some sense, you\nand I are not separate from that thing, and we're\nnot separate from each other. - Yeah, well, I have to\nquestion the fashion choices on my end then. All right, so you mentioned you agree in terms of consciousness, on\na lot of things with Annaka. Is there somebody, friend or friendly foe, that you disagree with in\nsome nuanced, interesting way, or some major way about consciousness, about these topics of reality\nthat you return to often? It's like Christopher Hitchens with the Rabbi David Wallby have had interesting\nconversations through years that added to the complexity and the beauty of their friendship. Is there somebody like that, that over the years has been a source of disagreement with you that strengthened your ideas? - Hmm, my ideas have been\nreally shaped by several things. One is the physicalist framework that my scientific colleagues, almost to a person have\nadopted, and that I adopted too. The reason I walked away from\nit was because it became clear that we couldn't start with\nunconscious ingredients and boot up consciousness. - Can you define physicalist in contrast to reductionist. - So a physicalist, I would say, is someone who takes space time and the objects within space time as ontologically fundamental. - Right, and then reductionist\nis saying the smaller, the more fundamental. - That's a methodological thing. That's saying within space time, as you go to smaller and\nsmaller scales in space, you get deeper and deeper laws, more and more fundamental laws. And the reduction of\ntemperature to particle movement was an example of that. But I think that that\nthe reason that worked was almost an artifact of\nthe nature of our interface. - That was for a long time, your colleagues including\nyourself, were physicalist, and now you broke away. - Broke away because I\nthink you can't start with unconscious ingredients\nand boot up consciousness. - So even with Roger Penrose, where there's like a gray area. - Right, and here's the\nchallenge I would put to all of my friends\nand colleagues who are, give one specific conscious experience that you can boot up, right? So if you think that it's\nintegrated information, and I've asked this of\nGiulio Tononi a couple times, back in the nineties, and\nthen just a couple years ago. Asked Giulio, okay, so great\nintegrated information. So we're all interested in explaining some specific conscious experiences. So pick one, the taste of chocolate. What is the integrated\ninformation, precise structure that we need for chocolate? And why does that structure\nhave to be for chocolate? And why is it that it could\nnot possibly be vanilla? Is there any, I asked them, is there any one specific\nconscious experience that you can account for? Because notice they've\nset themselves the task of booting up conscious\nexperiences from physical systems. That's the task they've set themselves. - But that doesn't mean they're, I understand your intuition, but that doesn't mean they're wrong just because they can't find\na way to boot it up yet. - That's right. No, that doesn't mean that they're wrong. It just just means that\nthey haven't done it. I think it's principled. The reason is principled, but I'm happy that they're exploring it. But the fact is, the remarkable fact is there's not one theory. So integrated information theory, orchestrated collapse of microtubules, global workspace theory. - These are all theories of consciousness. - [Lex] These are all\ntheories of consciousness. There's not a single theory that can give you a specific\nconscious experience that they say, here is\nthe physical dynamics or the physical structure. That must be the taste of chocolate or whatever one they want. - So you're saying it's impossible. They're saying it is just hard. - Yeah, I mean my attitude is, okay, no one said you had to start with neurons or physical systems and\nboot up consciousness. - [Lex] You guys are just taking that. - You chose that problem. So since you chose that problem, how much progress have you made? Well, when you've not been able to come up with a single specific\nconscious experience, and you've had these\nbrilliant people working on it for decades now, that's\nnot really good progress. - Let me ask you to play devil's advocate, can you try to steel\nman, steel man meaning argue the best possible case for reality, the opposite of your book title? Or maybe just sticking to consciousness, can you take the physicalist view? Can you steel man the physicalist view for a brief moment\nplaying devil's advocate, or steel man the person you used to be? So a physicalist. What's a good, like saying that you might be wrong right now, what would be a convincing\nargument for that? - Well, I think the argument I would give and that I believed was, look, when you have very simple physical systems like a piece of dirt,\nthere's not much evidence of life or consciousness. It's only when you get really\ncomplicated physical systems like that have brains. And really, the more\ncomplicated the brains, the more it looks like\nthere's consciousness and the more complicated\nthat consciousness is. Surely that means that\nsimple physical systems don't create much consciousness,\nor if maybe not any. Or maybe if panpsychists, they create the most elementary kinds of simple conscious experiences, but you need more\ncomplicated physical systems to boot up to create more\ncomplicated consciousnesses. I think that's the intuition that drives most of my colleagues. - And you're saying that\nthis concept of complexity is ill-defined when you\nground it to space time? - Oh, well, I think it's well defined within the framework of space time, right? - No, it's ill defined\nrelative to what you need to actually understand consciousness, because you're grounding\ncomplexity just in space time. - Oh, got you. Right, right. Yeah, what what I'm saying is, if it were true that space\ntime was fundamental, then I would have to agree that if there is such a\nthing as consciousness, given the data that we've got that complex brains have consciousness and dirt doesn't, that\nsomehow it's the complexity of the dynamics or organization, the function of the physical system that somehow is creating\nthe consciousness. So under those assumptions, yes, but when the physicists\nthemselves are telling us that space time is not\nfundamental, then I can understand, see then the whole picture\nstarts to come into focus. My colleagues are brilliant, right? These are really smart people. I mean, Francis Crick worked on this for the last 20 years of his life. I mean, these are not stupid people. These are brilliant, brilliant people. The fact that we've come up with not a single specific\nconscious experience that we can explain, and no hope. There's no one that says, I'm close, I'll have it for you in a year. No, there's just like\nthis fundamental gap. So much so that Steve Pinker\nin one of his writings says, look, he likes the\nglobal workspace theory, but he says the last dollop of the theory in which there's something it's like, we may have to just stipulate\nthat as a brute fact. And Pinker is brilliant, right? He understands the state\nof play on this problem, the hard problem of consciousness, starting with physicalist assumptions and then trying to boot up consciousness. You've set yourself the problem. I'm starting with physical\nstuff that's not conscious. I'm trying to get the\ntaste of chocolate out as maybe some kind of function\nof the dynamics of that. We've not been able to do that. And so Pinker is saying\nwe may have to punt, we may have to just\nstipulate that last bit, he calls it the last dollop, and just stipulate it\nas a bare fact of nature that there is something that's like, well, from my point of view is the physical, the whole point, the whole\npromise of the physicalist was we wouldn't have to stipulate. I was gonna start with the physical stuff and explain where the\nconsciousness came from. If I'm gonna stipulate consciousness, why don't I just stipulate consciousness and not stipulate all\nthe physical stuff too? So I'm stipulating less. I'm saying, okay, I agree. - [Lex] Which is the panpsychist\nperspective, I suppose. - Well, it's actually what I call the conscious realist perspective. - [Lex] Conscious realist. - Panpsychists are\neffectively dualists, right? They're saying there's physical stuff that really is fundamental\nand then consciousness stuff. So I would go with Pinker and say, look, let's just stipulate\nthe consciousness stuff, but I'm not gonna stipulate\nthe physical stuff. I'm gonna actually now show how to boot up the physical stuff from just\nthe consciousness stuff. So I'll stipulate less. - Is it possible?"

      "text": "So if you stipulate less, is it possible for our limited brains\nto visualize reality as we delve deeper and deeper and deeper? Is it possible to visualize\nsomehow, with the tools of math, with the tools of computers,\nwith the tools of our mind? Are we hopelessly lost? You said there's ways to intuit what's true using\nmathematics and probability and sort of Markovian dynamics,\nall that kind of stuff. But that's not visualizing, that's kind of building intuition. But is it possible to visualize\nin the way we visualize so nicely in space time,\nin four dimensions, in three dimensions, sorry. Well, two. We really are looking through\na two dimensional screen until it's what we intuit to\nbe a three dimensional world. And also inferring dynamic\nstuff, making it 4D. Anyway, is it possible to\nvisualize some pretty pictures that give us a deeper sense\nof the truth of reality? - I think that we will\nincrementally be able to do that. I think that, for example,\nthe picture that we have of electrons and photons\ninteracting and scattering wasn't, it may have not been possible until Faraday did all of his experiments, and then Maxwell wrote down his equations, and we were then sort of\nforced by his equations to think in a new way. And then when Plunk in 1900, desperate to try to solve the problem of black body radiation, what they call the\nultraviolet catastrophe, where Newton was predicting\ninfinite energies where there weren't infinite energies in black body radiation. And he, in desperation,\nproposed packets of energy. Then once you've done that, and then you have a Einstein\ncome along five years later and show how that explains\nthe photo electric effect. And then, eventually in\n1926 you get quantum theory, and then you get this whole\nnew way of thinking that was, from the Newtonian point of view, completely contradictory and\ncounterintuitive certainly. And maybe if Dyson is\nright, not contradictory, maybe if you use intuitionist math, they're not contradictory, but still certainly you wouldn't have gone there. And so here's a case where the experiments and then a desperate mathematical move, sort of we use those as a\nflashlight into the deep fog. And so that science may be the\nflashlight into the deep fog. - I wonder if it's still\npossible to visualize, like we talk about consciousness from a self perspective experience, hold that idea in our mind, the way you can experience\nthings directly. We've evolved to experience\nthings in this 3D world, and that's a very rich experience. When you're thinking mathematically, you still in the end of the\nday have to project it down to a low dimensional\nspace to make conclusions. Your conclusions will\nbe a number, or a line, or a plot, or a visual. So I wonder like how we can really touch some deep truth in a subjective way, like experience it, really\nfeel the beauty of it in the way that humans feel beauty. Are we screwed? - I don't think we're screwed. I think that we get little hints of it, from psychedelic drugs and so forth. We get hints that there\nare certain interventions that we can take on our interface. I apply this chemical, which is just some element of\nmy interface to this other, to a brain by ingesting it. And all of a sudden I seem\nlike I've opened new portals into conscious experiences. Well, that's very, very suggestive. That's like the black body\nradiation doing something that we didn't expect, right? It doesn't go to infinity when we thought it was\ngonna go to infinity and we're forced to propose these quanta. So once we have a theory\nof conscious agents, and its projection into\nspace time, I should say, I should sketch what I\nthink that projection is. But then I think we can then start to ask specific questions. When you're taking DMT,\nor you're taking LSD, or something like that, now\nthat we have this deep model, we've reverse engineered space and time and physical particles,\nwe've pulled them back to this theory of conscious agents. Now we can ask ourselves,\nin this idealized future, what are we doing to conscious agents when we apply 5-MeO-DMT,\nwhat are we doing? Are we opening a new portal? So when I say that, I mean, I have a portal into consciousness that I call my body of Lex\nFridman that I'm creating. And it's a genuine portal, not perfect, but it's a genuine portal. I'm definitely communicating\nwith your consciousness. And we know that we have one technology for building new portals. We know one technology,\nand that is having kids. Having kids is how we build\nnew portals into consciousness. It takes a long time. - Can you elaborate that? Oh, oh, oh, you mean like. - Your son and your daughter didn't exist. That was a portal. You're having contact with consciousness that you never would have had before, but now you've got a son or a daughter. You went through this physical process, they were born, there was all that. - Is that portal yours? So when you have kids, are\nyou creating new portals that are completely\ndistinct from the portals that you've created with\nother consciousness? Like can you elaborate on that? To which degree are the\nconsciousness of your kids a part of you? - Well, so every person that\nI see, that symbol that I see, the body that I see,\nis a portal potentially for me to interact with a consciousness. - [Lex] Yeah. - And each consciousness\nhas unique character. We call it a personality and so forth. So with each new kid that's born, we come in contact with a personality that we've never seen before, and a version of consciousness that we've never seen\nbefore at a deeper level. The theory says there's one agent. So this is a different\nprojection of that one agent. But, so that's what I mean by a portal is, within my own interface,\nmy own projection, can I see other projections\nof that one consciousness. So can I get portals in that sense? And I think we will get a theory of that, that we will get a theory of portals, and then we can ask how the\npsychedelics are acting. Are they actually creating\nnew portals or not? If they're not, we should\nnevertheless then understand how we could create a new portal. Maybe we have to just study what happens when we have kids. We know that that technology\ncreates new portals. So we have to reverse engineer that and then say, okay, could we somehow create new portals de novo with that? - With something like\nbrain computer interfaces, for example. - Yeah, maybe just a chemical\nor something like that more complicated than a chemical. That's why I think that the psychedelics, the psychedelics may,\nbecause they might be affecting this portal in certain ways that it turns it around and opens up. In other words, maybe once we understand this thing is a portal,\nyour body as a portal, and understand all of its complexities, maybe we'll realize that\nthat portal can be shifted to different parts of\nthe deeper consciousness and give new windows on it. And so in that way, maybe yes, psychedelics could open up new portals in the sense that they're taking something that's already a complex portal\nand just tweaking it a bit. - Well, but creating is a\nvery powerful difference between morphing. - [Donald] Tweaking versus\nthe creating, I agree. - But maybe it gives you intuition to at least the full space\nof the kinds of things that this particular system is capable of. I mean, the idea, your idea that the consciousness creates brains. I mean, that breaks my brain, because I guess I'm still a\nphysicalist in that sense, because it is just much\neasier to intuit the world. It's very practical to think, all right, there's a neural network, and what are the different ways, fascinating capabilities can emerge from this neural network? - [Donald] I agree, it's easier. - And so you start to present\nto yourself the problem of, okay, well how does consciousness arise? How does intelligence arise? How does emotion arise? How does memory arise, how do we filter within this system all the incoming sensory information we're able to allocate attention in different interesting ways? How do all those mechanisms arise? To say that there's\nother fundamental things we don't understand outside of space time that are actually core to\nhow this whole thing works is a bit paralyzing. Because it's like, oh, we're not 10% done. We're like 0.001% done. Is the immediate feeling. - I certainly understand that. My attitude about it is, if you\nlook at the young physicists who are searching for these\nstructures beyond space time, like amplituhedron and so forth, they're having a ball. Space time, that's what the old folks did. That's what the older generation did. We're doing something that\nreally is fun and new, and they're having a blast, and they're finding all\nthese new structures. So I think that we're going to succeed in getting a new deeper theory. I can just say what I'm hoping with the theory that I'm working on. I'm hoping to show that I could have this timeless dynamics of consciousness. No entropic time. I take a projection and I show how this timeless dynamics\nlooks like the big bang and the entire evolution of space time. In other words, I see how my\nwhole space time interface. - So not just, the projections doesn't just look like space time. You can explain with it the whole from the origin of the universe. - That's what we have to do. And that's what the physicists understand. When they go beyond space\ntime to the amplituhedron and the cosmological polytope, they ultimately know that\nthey have to get back the big bang story and\nthe whole evolution, that whole story where\nthere were no living things, there was just a point. And then the explosion, and then just particles at high energy, and then eventually the cooling down and the differentiation, and\nfinally matter condenses, and then life, and then consciousness. That whole story has to\ncome out of something that's deeper and without time. And that's what we're up to. We want to get that. So the whole story that\nwe've been telling ourselves about big bang and how brains\nevolve into consciousness will come out of a much deeper theory. And for someone like me, it's a lot. I mean, but for the younger generation, this is like, oh wow, all the\nlow cherries aren't picked. This is really good stuff. This is really new fundamental\nstuff that we can do. So I can't wait to read the papers of the younger generation,\nand I wanna see them. - Kids these days with their\nnon-space time assumptions."

      "text": "It's just interesting looking\nat the philosophical tradition of this difficult ideas you struggle with. If you look like somebody\nlike Emmanuel Kant, what are some interesting\nagreements and disagreements you have with the guy about\nthe nature of reality? - So there's a lot in agreement, right? So Kant was an idealist,\ntranscendental idealist, and he basically had the\nidea that we don't see nature as it is. We impose a structure on nature. And so in some sense, I'm\nsaying something similar. I'm saying that, by the way, I don't call myself an idealist. I call myself a conscious realist, because idealism has a long history. A lot of different ideas\ncome under idealism, and there's a lot of debates and so forth. It tends to be identified with, in many cases, anti-science\nand anti-realism And I don't want either\nconnection with my ideas. And so I just called\nmine conscious realism, with an emphasis on realism,\nand not anti-realism. But one place where I would\nof course disagree with Kant was that he thought that\nEuclidean space time was a priori. We just know that that's false. So he went too far on that. But in general, the\nidea that we don't start with space time, that space\nand time is in some sense the forms of our perceptions. Yes, absolutely. And I would say that\nthere's a lot in common with Barkley in that regard. There's a lot of ingenious\narguments in Barkley. Leibniz, in his monodology, understood very clearly\nthat the hard problem was not solvable. He posed a hard problem\nand basically dismissed it and just said, you can't do this. And so if he came here\nand saw where we are, he'd say, look guys, I told\nyou this 300 years ago, and he had his monodology. He was trying to do something like this, it's different from what I'm doing. But he had these things that\nwere not in space and time, these monads. He was trying to build something. I'm trying to build a\ntheory of conscious agents. My guess is that if he\ncame here, I could just, if he saw what I was doing, he would say, he would understand it and\nimmediately take off with it and go places that I couldn't. He would have no problems. - So there would be, right,\nthere would be overlap of the spirit of the ideas, would be totally overlapping. - But his genius would\nthen just run with it far faster than I could. - I love the humility here. So let me ask you about sort\nof practical implications"

      "section": "Ephemerality of life",
      "text": "of your ideas to our world,\nour complicated world. When you look at the big\nquestions of humanity, of hate, war, what else is there, evil? Maybe there's the\npositive aspects of that, of meaning, of love. What is the fact that reality\nis an illusion perceived? What is the conscious realism? When applied to daily life, what kind of impact does it have? - A lot, and it's sort of scary. We all know that life is ephemeral, and spiritual traditions have said, wake up to the fact that\nanything that you do here is gonna disappear. But it's even more ephemeral\nthan perhaps we have thought. I see this bottle because\nI create it right now. As soon as I look away, that data structure has\nbeen garbage collected. That bottle, I have to\nrecreate it every time I look. So I spend all my money and\nI buy this fancy car that, that car, I have to keep recreating it every time I look at\nit, it's that ephemeral. So all the things that\nwe invest ourselves in, we fight over, and we\nkill each other over, and we have wars over. These are all, it's just like people in a virtual reality simulation, and there's this Porsche, and we all see the Porsche. Well, that Porsche\nexists when I look at it, I turn my headset and I look at it, and then if Joe turns his\nheadset in the right way, he'll see his Porsche. But it's not even the\nsame Porsche that I see. He's creating his own Porsche. So these things are exceedingly ephemeral. And now just imagine saying\nthat that's my Porsche. Well, you can agree to say\nthat it's your Porsche, but really the Porsche only\nexists as long as you look. So this, all of a sudden, what the spiritual\ntraditions have been saying for a long, long time,\nthis gets cashed out in mathematically precise science. It's saying ephemeral, yes, in fact, it lasts for a few milliseconds, a few hundred milliseconds\nwhile you look at it, and then it's gone. So the whole idea, why are\nwe fighting, why do we hate? We fight over possessions because we think that we're small little objects inside this preexisting space time. We assume that that mansion and that car exists independent of us and that somehow these little things can\nhave our sense of self and importance enhanced by\nhaving that special car, or that special house,\nor that special person, when in fact it's just the opposite. You create that mansion\nevery time you look. You're something far\ndeeper than that mansion. You're the entity which can\ncreate that mansion on the fly. And there's nothing there. There's nothing to the mansion except what you create in this moment. So all of a sudden, when\nyou take this point of view, it has all sorts of implications for how we interact with each other, how we treat each other. And again, a lot of things that spiritual traditions\nhave said, it's a mixed bag. Spiritual traditions are a mixed bag. So lemme just be right\nup front about that. I'm not promoting any particular, but they do have some insights. - They have wisdom. - They have certain wisdom. I can point to nonsense. I won't go into it, but I can also point to lots of nonsense. So the issue is to then to\nlook for the key insights. And I think they have a lot of insights about the ephemeral nature\nof objects in space and time and not being attached to\nthem, including our own bodies, and reversing that I'm\nnot this little thing, a little consciousness\ntrapped in the body, and the consciousness itself\nis only a product of the body. So when the body dies, the\nconsciousness disappears. It turns completely around. The consciousness is fundamental. The body, my hand exists right now because I'm looking at it. My hand is gone. I have no hand, I have no\nbrain, I have no heart. If you looked, you'll see a heart. Whatever I am is this\nreally complicated thing in consciousness. That's what I am. All the stuff that I thought I was is something that I create\non the fly and delete. So this is completely\na radical restructuring of how we think about\npossessions, about identity, about survival of death and so forth. This is completely transformative. But the nice thing is\nthat this whole approach of conscious agents, unlike\nthe spiritual traditions, which has said in some\ncases similar things, they said it imprecisely. This is mathematics. We can actually now begin to say precisely here's the mathematical\nmodel of consciousness, conscious agents. Here's how it maps onto space time, which I should sketch really briefly. And here's why things are ephemeral, and here's why you shouldn't be worried about the ephemeral nature of things, because you're not a little tiny entity inside space and time, quite the opposite. You're the author of space and time. - The I, and the am, and the I am is all kind of emergent\nthrough this whole process of evolution and so on. That's just surface waves, and there's a much deeper ocean that we're trying to figure out here. So you said of the stuff\nyou're thinking about maps to space time, how\ndoes it map to space time? - Right, so just a very, very high level, I'll keep it brief. The structures that the\nphysicists are finding, like the amplituhedron, it turns out they're\njust static structure. They're polytopes. But they, remarkably, most\nof the information in them is contained in permutation matrices. So it's a matrix like an NxN matrix that just has zeros and ones. That contains almost\nall of the information. And they have these\nplotted graphs and so forth that they use to boot up the scattering. You can compute those\nscattering amplitudes almost entirely from these\npermutation matrices. So that's just now from my point of view, I have this conscious agent dynamics. It turns out that the stationary\nthat I was talking about, where the entropy is increasing, all the stationary\ndynamics are sketched out by permutation matrices. So there's a so-called Burkhoff polytope. All the vertices of this polytope, all the points are permutation matrices. All the internal points\nare markovian kernels that have the uniform measure\nas a stationary measure. - I need to intuit a little better what the heck you're talking about. So basically there's some\ncomplicated thing going on with the network of conscious agents. And that's mappable to this. - [Donald] That's right. - You're saying a two dimensional matrix that scattering has to do with\nwhat, with the perception? Like that's like photon stuff or? I mean, I don't know if it's useful to sort of dig into detail. - I'll do just the high level thing. So the high level is, the long-term behavior of\nthe conscious agent dynamics. So that's a projection. Just looking at the long-term behavior I'm hoping will give rise\nto the amplituhedron. The amplituhedron then\ngives rise to space time. And so then I can just use their link to go all the way from consciousness, through its asymptotics, through the amplituhedron,\ninto space time, and get the map all the\nway into our interface. - And that's why you mentioned\nthe permutation matrix, because it gives you a nice\nthing to try to generate. - That's right. It's the connection\nwith the amplituhedron. The permutation matrices are the core of the amplituhedron. And it turns out they're the core of the asymptotic description\nof the conscious agents. - So not to sort of bring\nup the idea of a creator, but first of all, I like video games."

      "text": "And you mentioned this\nkind of simulation idea. First of all, do you think\nof, as an interesting idea, this thought experiment that\nwe live in a simulation? And in general, do you think\nwe live in a simulation? - So Nick Bostrom's idea\nabout the simulation is typically couched in\na physicalist framework. - [Lex] Yes. - So there's the bottom level. There's some programmer\nin a physical space time, and they have a computer\nthat they've programmed brilliantly and cleverly where they've created conscious entities. So you have the hard problem\nof consciousness, right? The standard hard problem. How could a computer simulation\ncreate a consciousness? Which isn't explained by\nthat simulation theory. But then the idea is that the next level, the entities that are created in the first level simulation, then can write their own simulations, and you get this nesting. So the idea that this\nis a simulation is fine, but the idea that it starts\nwith a physicalist base, I think isn't fine. - There's different properties here. The partial rendering. And to me that's the interesting idea is not whether the entirety\nof the universe is simulated, but how efficiently can\nyou create interfaces that are convincing to all other entities that can appreciate such interfaces? How little does it take? Because you said like partial rendering, or like temporal, ephemeral\nrendering of stuff. Only render the tree falling in the forest when there's somebody there to see it. It's interesting to think, how can you do that super efficiently without having to render everything? And that to me is one\nperspective on the simulation, just like it is with video games, right? Where a video game doesn't have to render every single thing. It's just the thing that\nthe observer is looking at. - Right, there is actually,\nthat's a very nice question. And there's whole groups of researchers that are actually studying,\nin virtual reality, what is the sort of minimal\nrequirements on the system? How does it have to operate to give you an immersion experience, to give you the feeling\nthat you have a body, to get you to take it real? And there's actually a\nlot of really good work on that right now. And it turns out it\ndoesn't take that much. You do need to get the\nperception action loop tight, and you have to give them the perceptions that they're expecting\nif you want them to. But if you can lead them along, if you give them\nperceptions that are close to what they're expecting, you can then maybe move\ntheir reality around a bit. - Yeah, it's a tricky engineering problem, especially when you\ntry to create a product that's costs little, but it feels like an engineering problem, not a deeply scientific problem. Meaning, obviously it's\na scientific problem, but as a scientific problem,\nit's not that difficult to trick us descendants of apes. - But here's a case\nfor just us in our own, if this is a virtual reality that we're experiencing right now. So here's something you\ncan try for yourself. If you just close your eyes and look at your\nexperience in front of you, to be aware of your\nexperience in front of you, what you experience is just\nlike a modeled dark gray. There's some dynamics to\nit, but it's just dark gray. But now I ask you, instead of\nhaving your attention forward, put your attention backward. What is it like behind\nyou with your eyes closed? And there it's like nothing. It's really. So what is going on here? What am I experiencing back there? - I don't know if it's nothing. It's like, I guess it's the absence of, it's not even like darkness or something. - It's not even darkness. There's no qualia to it. And yet there is a sense of being, and that's the interesting thing. There's a sense of being back. So I close my eyes, I\nput my attention forward. I have the quality of a gray model thing, but when I put my attention backward, there's no quality at all. But there is a sense of being. - I personally, now you haven't been to that side of the room. I have been to that side of the room. So for me, memories, I start playing the engine of memory\nreplay, which is like, I take myself back in time and think about that place where I was hanging out in that part. That's what I see when I'm behind. So that's an interesting\nquirk of human humans too. We're collecting these experiences and we can replay them in interesting ways whenever we feel like it. And it's almost like being\nthere, but not really, but almost. - That's right. And yet we can go our\nentire lives on this. You're talking about the\nminimal thing for VR. We can go our entire lives and not realize that all of my life, it's been like nothing behind me. We're not even aware\nthat all of our lives, if you just pay attention, close your, pay attention\nto what's behind me, we're like, oh, holy smoke. It's totally scary. I mean, it's like nothing. There's no quality there at all. How did I not notice that my entire life? We're so immersed in the simulation, we buy it so much. - Yeah, I mean you could see\nthis with children, right? With persistence you could\ndo the peekaboo game, you can hide from them and appear, and they're fully tricked. And in the same way we're fully tricked. There's nothing behind us,\nand we assume there is."

      "text": "And that's really interesting. These theories are pretty heavy. You as a human being,\nas a mortal human being, how has these theories\nbeen to you personally? Like, are there good days and bad days, when you wake up and look in the mirror and the fact that you can't\nsee anything behind you, the fact that it's rendered? Like is there interesting quirks, you know Nietzsche with his, if you gaze long into the\nabyss, the abyss gazes into you. How has this theories, these\nideas changed you as a person? - It's been very, very difficult. The stuff is not just\nabstract theory building, because it's about us. Sometimes I've realized that there's this big division of me. My mind is doing all this science and coming up with these conclusions, and the rest of me is not integrating. It's just like, I don't believe it. I just don't believe this. So as I start to take it seriously, I get scared myself. It's like, but it's very much, then I read these spiritual traditions and realize they're saying\nvery, very similar things. There is a lot of conversion. So for me, the first time I thought it might be possible that\nwe're not seeing the truth was in 1986. It was from some\nmathematics we were doing. And when that hit me, it\nhit me like a ton of bricks. I had to sit down. It was scary. It was really a shock to the system. And then to realize that everything that has been important to\nme, like getting a house, getting a car, getting a\nreputation and so forth. Well that car is just like the car I see in the virtual reality. It's there when you perceive\nit and it's not there. So the whole question of\nwhat am I doing and why, what's worthwhile doing in life? Clearly getting a big house\nand getting a big car. I mean, we all knew\nthat we were gonna die. So we tend not to know that. We tend to hide it,\nespecially when we're young. Before age 30, we don't\nbelieve we're gonna die. - We factually maybe know that you kind of are supposed to, yeah. - But they'll figure something out and we'll be the generation\nthat is the first one that doesn't have to die. That's the kind of thing. But when you really face the fact that you're going to die, and then when I start to look at it from this point of view that, well, this thing was an interface to begin with. So is what I'm really gonna be doing just taking off a headset. So I've been playing in a\nvirtual reality game all day, and I got lost in the game, and I was fighting over a Porsche. And I shot some guys up and\nI punctured their tires, but I got the Porsche. Now I take the headset\noff, and what was that for? Nothing. It was just a data structure\nand the data structure is gone. So all of the wars, the\nfighting and the reputations and all this stuff, it is just a headset. And so my theory says that intellectually, my mind, my emotions\nrebel all over the place. And so I have to mention,\nI meditate a lot. - What percent of the day would you say you spend as a physicalist\nsort of living life, pretending your car matters,\nyour reputation matter? Like how much, what's that Tom Waits song? I like my town with a\nlittle drop of poison. How much poison do you\nallow yourself to have? - I think my default mode is physicalist. I think that that's just the default. When I'm not being conscious, consciously attentive. - Intellectually consciously attentive. Because if you're just, you're still, if you're tasting coffee and\nnot thinking, or drinking, or just taking in the sunset,\nyou're not being intellectual. But you're still experiencing it. So it's when you turn on\nthe introspective machine, that's when you can start. - And turn off the thinker. When I actually just start\nlooking without thinking. So that's when I feel like all of a sudden I'm starting to see through, it's sort of like, okay,\npart of part of the addiction to the interface is all the\nstories I'm telling about it. It's really important for me to get that, really important to do that. So I'm telling all these stories, and so I'm all wrapped up,\nalmost all of the mind stuff that's going on in my\nhead is about attachment to the interface. And so what I've found is that, essentially the only way to\nreally detach from the interface is to literally let go\nof thoughts altogether. And then all of a\nsudden, even my identity, my whole history, my name, my education and all this stuff is almost irrelevant because it's just now,\nhere is the present moment. And this is the reality right now. And all of that other stuff\nis an interface story. But this conscious experience right now, this is the only reality\nas far as I can tell. The rest of it's a story. But that is, again, not my default, that is I have to make a\nreally conscious choice to say, okay, I know intellectually this is all an interface. I'm gonna take the\nheadset off and so forth. And then immediately\nsink back into the game and just be out there playing the game and get lost in it. So I'm always lost in the game unless I literally consciously\nchoose to stop thinking. - Isn't it terrifying to acknowledge that, to look beyond the game? - Scares the hell outta me. It really is scary. Because I'm so attached,\nI'm attached to this body, I'm attached to the interface. - Are you ever worried about\nbreaking your brain a bit? Meaning like it's, I mean, some of these ideas\nwhen you think about reality, even with like Einstein, just\nrealizing you said interface, just realizing that light,\nthat there's a speed of light, and you can't go faster\nthan the speed of light, and like what kind of things black holes can do with light. Even that can mess with your head. - [Donald] Yes. - But that's still space time. - That's a big mess, but\nit's still just space time. It's still a property of our interface. That's right. - Even Einstein realized\nthat this particular thing, some of the stories you tell ourselves is constructing interfaces that are oversimplifying\nthe way things work. Because it's nice. The stories are nice. Stories are nice. That's why, I mean, just like\nvideo games, they're nice. - Right, but Einstein\nwas a realist, right? He was a famous realist, in the sense that he was very explicit, in a 1935 paper with Petuskin\nRosen, the EPR paper, right? They said, if without in\nany way disturbing a system, I can predict with probability one the outcome of a measurement, then there exists in reality\nthat element, that value. And we now know from quantum\ntheory that that's false. That Einstein's idea of local realism is strictly speaking false. And so we can predict, in quantum theory, you can set up, and there's a paper by Chris Fuchs, quantum bayesianism,\nwhere he scouts this out. It was done by other people, but he gives a good presentation of this, where they have a sequence of something like nine\ndifferent quantum measurements that you can make. And you can predict with probability one what a particular outcome will be, but you can actually\nprove that it's impossible that the value existed before\nyou made the measurement. So you know with probability\none what you're gonna get, but you also know with certainty that that value was not there until you made the measurement. So we know from quantum theory that the act of observation\nis an act of fact creation. And that is built into what I'm saying with this theory of consciousness. If consciousness is fundamental, space time itself is an\nact of fact creation. It's an interface that we create, consciousness creates,\nplus all the objects in it. So local realism is not true. Quantum theory has established that. Also non-con contextual\nrealism is not true. And that fits in perfectly with this idea that consciousness is fundamental. These things exist as data\nstructures when we create them. As Chris Fuchs says,\nthe act of observation is an act of fact creation. But I must say, on a personal level, I'm having to spend, I\nspend a couple hours a day just sitting in meditation on this and facing the rebellion in\nme that goes to the core. It feels like it goes\nto the core of my being. Rebellion against these ideas. So here it is very, very\ninteresting for me to look at this because, so here I'm a\nscientist and I'm a person. The science is really clear. Local realism is false. Non-contextual realism is false. Space time is doomed. It's very, very clear. It couldn't be clearer. And my emotions rebel left and right. When I sit there and say,\nokay, I am not something in space and time, then\nsomething inside of me says, you're crazy. Of course you are. And I'm completely attached to it. I'm completely attached to all this stuff. I'm attached to my body,\nI'm attached to the headset, I'm attached to my car,\nattached to people. I'm attached to all of it. And yet I know as an absolute fact, I'm gonna walk away from all of it. I'm gonna die. In fact, I almost died last year. Covid almost killed me. I sent a goodbye text to my\nwife, so I thought I was. - [Lex] You really did? - I sent her a goodbye. I was in the emergency room, and it had attacked my heart, and it had been at 190 beats\nper minute for 36 hours. I couldn't last much longer, I knew it. They couldn't stop it. - [Lex] So that was it. - So that was it. So I texted her goodbye\nfrom the emergency room. - [Lex] I love you, goodbye kind of thing? - Yeah, right. Yeah, that was it. - [Lex] Were you afraid? - Yeah, it scares the hell of you, right? But there was, you're\njust feeling so bad anyway that sort of, you're scared,\nbut you're just feeling so bad that in some sense you just\nwant it to stop anyway. So I've been there and\nfaced it just a year ago. - How did that change you, by the way, having this intellectual\nreality that's so challenging that you meditate on, that\nit is just an interface, and one of the hardest\nthings to come to terms with is that that means that it's gonna end. How did that change you\nhaving come so close to the reality of it? It's not just an intellectual reality. It's a reality of death. - It's forced, I've\nmeditated for 20 years now, and I would say averaging\nthree or four hours a day. But it's put a new urgency, but urgency is not the right word. It's riveted my attention,\nI'll put it that way. It's really riveted my attention. And I've really paid, I've spent a lot more time looking at what spiritual traditions say. I don't, by the way, again, take it all with a grain of salt. But on the other hand, I think it's stupid for me to ignore it. So I try to listen to the best ideas and to sort out nonsense from. And it's just we all have to\ndo it for ourselves, right? It's not easy. So what makes sense, and I have the advantage of some science, so I can look at what science\nsays and try to compare with spiritual tradition. I try to sort it out for myself. But then I also look and realize that there's\nanother aspect to me, which is this whole emotional aspect. I seem to be wired up, as evolutionary psychology\nsays I'm wired up, right? All these defensive mechanisms, I'm inclined to lie if I need to. I'm inclined to be angry, to protect myself, to have\nan ingroup and an outgroup, to try to make my reputation\nas big as possible to try to demean the outgroup. There's all these things that evolutionary psychology is spot on. It is really brilliant\nabout the human condition. And yet I think evolution, as\nI said, evolutionary theory is a projection of a deeper theory where there may be no competition. So I'm in this very interesting position where I feel like, okay,\naccording to my own theory, I'm consciousness. And maybe this is what it means for consciousness to wake up. It's not easy. It's almost like I have, I feel like I have real skin in the game. It really is scary. I really was scared\nwhen I was about to die. It really was hard to\nsay goodbye to my wife. It really pained. And to then look at that,\nand then look at the fact that I'm gonna walk away from this anyway, and it's just an interface. How do I, so it's trying to\nput all this stuff together and really grock it, so to speak. Not just intellectually, but grock it at an emotional level. - Yeah, what are you afraid of, you silly evolved organism\nthat's gotten way too attached to the interface? What are you really afraid of? - [Donald] That's right. - Is there a. - Very personal, you know,\nit's very, very personal. - I mean, speaking of that text,"

      "text": "what do you think is\nthis whole love thing? What's the role of love\nin our human condition, this interface thing we have? Is this somehow interweaved, interconnected with consciousness, this attachment we have to other humans and this deep, there's some quality to it that seems very interesting, peculiar. - Well, there are two levels\nI would think about that. There's love in the sexual sense, and then there's love in a deeper sense. And in the sexual sense, we can give an evolutionary\naccount of that and so forth. And I think that's pretty clear to people in this deeper sense, right? So of course I married, I love\nmy wife in a sexual sense. But there's a deeper sense as well. When I was saying goodbye to her, there was a much deeper love that was really at play there. That's one place where I think that the mixed bag from\nspiritual traditions has something right. When they say love your\nneighbor as yourself, that in some sense love is fundamental. I think that they're onto something, something very, very deep and profound. And every once in a while I can get a personal glimpse of that. Especially when I'm in\nthe space with no thought. When I can really let go of thoughts, I get little glimpses of a love in the sense that I'm not separate. It's a love in the sense that\nI'm not different from that. If you and I are separate,\nthen I can fight you. But if you and I are the\nsame, there's a union there. - The togetherness of it. Who's God? All those gods, the stories that have been told\nthroughout history, you said, through the spiritual traditions. What do you think that is? Is that us trying to find\nthat common thing at the core? - Well in many traditions, not all, the one I was raised in, so my dad was a Protestant minister, we tend to think of God as a being. But I think that that's not right. I think the closest way to\nthink about God is being period, not a being, but being, the very ground of being itself is God. I think that's the deep,\nand from my point of view, that's the ground of consciousness. So the ground of conscious\nbeing is what we might call God. But the word God has\nalways been, for example, you don't believe the same God is my God, so I'm gonna fight you. We will have wars over, because the being, the specific being that you call God is different from the\nbeing that I call God, and so we fight. Whereas if it's not a\nbeing, but just being, and you and I share being, then you and I are not separate and there's no reason to fight. We're both part of that one being, and loving you is loving myself. Because we're all part of that one being. The spiritual traditions\nthat point to that I think are pointing in a\nvery interesting direction. And that does seem to\nmatch with the mathematics of the conscious agent stuff that I've been working on as well. It really fits with that. Although that wasn't my goal. - Is there, you mentioned that the young physicist\nthat you talked to,"

Not just physicists, but in general, how to have a career they can be proud of, how they can have a life\nthey can be proud of, how to make their way in\nthe world from the lessons, from the wins and the\nlosses in your own life. What little insights could you pull out? - I would say the universe\nis a lot more interesting than you might expect. And you are a lot more\nspecial and interesting than you might expect. You might think that you're just a little, tiny, irrelevant 100\npound, 200 pound person in a vast billions of\nlight years across space. And that's not the case. You are in some sense the being that's creating that space all the time, every time you look. So waking up to who you really are outside of space and time, as the author of space and time, as the author of everything that you see. - The author of space and\ntime that's beautiful, sorry. - You're the author of space and time, and I'm the author of space and time, and space and time is just\none little data structure. Many other consciousnesses are creating other data structures, they're authors of various other things. So realizing, and then realizing that, I had this feeling growing\nup, going to college, reading all these textbooks,\noh man, it's all been done. If I'd just been there 50 years ago I could have discovered this stuff, but it's all in the textbooks now. Well, believe me, the\ntextbooks are gonna look silly in 50 years, and it's your\nchance to write the new textbook. So, of course study the current textbooks, you have to understand them. There's no way to progress until you understand what's been done. But then the only limit is\nyour imagination, frankly. That's the only limit. - The greatest books,\nthe greatest textbooks ever written on Earth\nare yet to be written. - [Donald] Exactly."

Like why, so you said the\nuniverse is kind of trying to figure itself out through us. Why? - Yeah, that's the closest I've come. So I'll give you, so I\nwill say that I don't know, but here's my guess. - Good first sentence. That's a good starting point. - And maybe that's\ngonna be a profound part of the final answer is to\nstart with the, I don't know. It is quite possible that\nthat's really important to start with the I don't know. My guess is that if\nconsciousness is fundamental, and if Godel's incompleteness\nthe holds here, and there's infinite variety of structures for consciousness to some sense explore, that maybe that's what it's about. This is something that\nAnnaka and I talked about a little bit, and she doesn't like this way of talking about it. And so I'm gonna have to\ntalk with her some more about this way of talking. But right now I'll just put it this way and I'll have to talk with her more and see if I can say it more clearly. But the way I'm talking\nabout it now is that there's a sense in which there's being, and then there's experiences, or forums that come out of being. That's one deep, deep mystery. And the question that you\nasked, what is it all about? Somehow it's related to that. Why does being, why doesn't it\njust stay without any forms? Why do we have experiences? Why not just have, when you close your eyes and pay attention to what's behind you, there's\nnothing, but there's being. Why don't we just stop there? Why didn't we just stop there? Why did we create all tables and chairs, and the sun, and moon, and people, all this really complicated stuff? Why? And all I can guess right now, and I'll probably kick\nmyself in a couple years and say, that was dumb, but\nall I can guess right now is that somehow consciousness\nwakes up to itself by knowing what it's not. So here I am, I'm not this body. And I sort of saw that,\nit was sort of in my face when I sent a text goodbye. But then as soon as I'm\nbetter sort of like, okay, I sort of don't wanna go there, right? So I am my body, I go back\nto the standard thinking, I am my body, and then\nI want to get that car. Even though I was just\nabout to die a year ago, so that comes rushing back. So consciousness immerses itself fully into a particular headset, gets lost in it, and then slowly wakes up. - Just so it can escape, and that is the waking up. But it needs to have negative. - [Donald] It needs to know what it's not. To know what you are, you have to say, oh, I'm not that, I'm not\nthat, that wasn't important, that wasn't important. - That's really powerful. Don, let me just say that, because I've been a\nlong term fan of yours, and we're supposed to have a conversation during this very difficult\nmoment in your life. Let me just say you're\na truly special person, and I, for one, I know there's\na lot of others that agree. I'm glad that you're still\nhere with us on this earth, if for a short time. So whatever the universe,\nwhatever plan it has for you that brought you close to death, to maybe enlighten you some kind of way, I think it has an\ninteresting plan for you. You're one of the truly special humans, and it's a huge honor that you would sit and talk with me today. Thank you so much. - Thank you very much, Lex,\nI really appreciate that.

  "full_text": "- Whatever reality is,\nit's not what you see. What you see is just an adaptive fiction. - The following is a\nconversation with Donald Hoffman, professor of cognitive\nsciences at UC Irvine, focusing his research on\nevolutionary psychology, visual perception, and consciousness. He's the author of over\n120 scientific papers on these topics, and his most recent book, titled \"The Case Against Reality, Why Evolution Hid The\nTruth From Our Eyes.\" I think some of the most\ninteresting ideas in this world, like those of Donald Hoffman's, attempt to shake the foundation of our understanding of reality, and thus, they take a long\ntime to internalize deeply. So proceed with caution. Questioning the fabric of reality can lead you to either\nmadness or the truth. And the funny thing is you\nwon't know which is which. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Donald Hoffman. In your book, \"The Case Against Reality, why Evolution Hid the\nTruth From Our Eyes,\" you make the bold claim\nthat the world we see with our eyes is not real. It's not even an abstraction\nof objective reality. It is completely detached\nfrom objective reality. Can you explain this idea? - Right, so this is a theorem from evolution by natural selection. So the technical question\nthat I and my team asked was, what is the probability\nthat natural selection would shape sensory systems to see true properties\nof objective reality? And to our surprise, we\nfound that the answer is precisely zero except for one, one kind of structure that we\ncan go into if you want to. But for any generic structure that you might think the world might have. A total order, a topology metric, the probability is precisely zero that natural selection would\nshape any sensory system of any organism to see any\naspect of objective reality. So in that sense, what we're\nseeing is what we need to see to stay alive long enough to reproduce. So in other words, we're\nseeing what we need to guide adaptive behavior. Full stop. - So the evolutionary process, the process that took us from\nthe origin of life on Earth to the humans that we are today, that process does not maximize for truth, it maximizes for fitness, as\nyou say, fitness beats truth. And fitness does not have\nto be connected to truth is the claim. And that's where you have an approach towards zero of probability\nthat we have evolved human cognition, human consciousness, whatever it is, the magic\nthat makes our mind work, evolved not for its ability\nto see the truth of reality, but its ability to survive\nin the environment. - That's exactly right. So most of us intuitively\nthink that surely the way that evolution will\nmake our senses more fit is to make them tell us more truths, or at least the truths we need to know about objective reality, the truths we need in our niche. That's the standard view,\nand it was the view I took. I mean, that's sort of what we're taught or just even assume. It's just sort of like\nthe intelligent assumption that we would all make, but we don't have to just wave our hands. Evolution of natural selection is a mathematically precise theory. John Maynard Smith in the seventies created evolutionary game theory, and we have evolutionary graph theory, and even genetic algorithms\nthat we can use to study this. And so we don't have to wave our hands. It's a matter of theorem\nand proof and or simulation before you get the therms and proofs. And a couple graduate students of mine, Chester Mark and Brian Marion, did some wonderful\nsimulations that tipped me off that there was something going on here. And then I went to a mathematician, Chachan Prakash, and Manish Singh, and some other friends\nof mine, Chris Fields, but Chachan was the real\nmathematician behind all this. And he's proved several theorems that uniformly indicate\nthat with one exception, which has to do with probability measures. The probability is zero. The reason there's an exception\nfor probability measures, so-called sigma algebras\nor sigmative classes, is that for any scientific theory, there is the assumption\nthat needs to be made that the whatever structure, the whatever probabilistic\nstructure the world may have is not unrelated to the\nprobabilistic structure of our perceptions. If they were completely unrelated, then no science would be possible. And so this is technically, the map from reality to\nour senses has to be a, so-called measurable map, has to preserve sigma algebras. But that means it could\nbe infinite to one, and it could collapse all\nsorts of event information. But other than that,\nthere's no requirement in standard evolutionary theory for fitness payoff functions, for example, to preserve any specific\nstructures of objective reality. So you can ask the technical question. This is one of the avenues we took. If you look at all the fitness payoffs from whatever world structure\nyou might want to imagine, so a world with say a total order on it. So it's got end states and\nthey're totally ordered, and then you can have a set of maps from that world into a set of payoffs, say from zero to a thousand or whatever you want your payoffs to be. And you can just literally\ncount all the payoff functions and just do the\ncomputations and count them. And then you can ask a precise question, how many of those payoff functions\npreserve the total order? If that's what you're, or how\nmany preserve the topology? And you just count them and divide. So the number that are homomorphisms versus the total number\nand then take the limit as the number of states in the world and the number of payoff\nvalues goes very large. And when you do that,\nyou get zero every time. - Okay, there's a million\nthings to ask here, but first of all, just in\ncase people are not familiar with your work, let's sort of linger on the big bold statement here. Which is, the thing we see with our eyes is not some kind of limited\nwindow into reality. It is completely detached from reality, likely completely detached from reality. You're saying a hundred percent likely. Okay, so none of this is real\nin the way we think is real, in the way we have this intuition. There's like, this table is\nsome kind of abstraction, but underneath it all, there's atoms, and there's an entire century of physics that describes the\nfunctioning of those atoms and the quarks that make them up. There's many Nobel prizes\nabout particles, and fields, and all that kind of stuff\nthat slowly builds up to something that's perceivable to us, both with our eyes, with our\ndifferent senses as this table. Then there's also ideas of chemistry that over layers of abstraction\nfrom DNA, to embryos, to cells that make the human body. So all of that is not real. - It's a real experience, and it's a real adaptive\nset of perceptions. So it's an adaptive set of perceptions. Full stop. We want to think. - [Lex] The perceptions are real. - So their perceptions are\nreal as perceptions, right? They are, we are having our perceptions, but we've assumed that there's\na pretty tight relationship between our perceptions and reality. If I look up and see the moon, then there is something that\nexists in space and time that matches what I perceive. And all I'm saying is\nthat if you take evolution by natural selection seriously, then that is precluded that\nour perceptions are there. They're there to guide\nadaptive behavior, full stop. They're not there to show you the truth. In fact, the way I think about it is they're there to hide the truth because the truth is too complicated. It's just like if you're\ntrying to use your laptop to write an email, right? What you're doing is toggling\nvoltages in the computer, but good luck trying to do it that way. The reason why we have a user interface is because we don't wanna\nknow that quote unquote truth, the diodes and resistors and all that, that terrible hardware. If you had to know all that truth, your friends wouldn't hear from you. So what evolution gave us was perceptions that guide adaptive behavior, and part of that process, it turns out, means hiding the truth\nand giving you eye candy. - So what's the difference\nbetween hiding the truth and forming abstractions, layers upon layers of abstractions over these low level voltages, and transistors, and chips,\nand programming languages from assembly to Python that then leads you to be\nable to have an interface like Chrome, where you open\nup another set of JavaScript and HTML programming languages that lead you to have a\ngraphical user interface on which you can then send\nyour friends an email? Is that completely detached\nfrom the zeros and ones that are firing away inside the computer? - It's not, of course. When I talk about the user\ninterface on your desktop, there's this whole sophisticated\nbackstory to it, right? The hardware and the software that's allowing that to happen. Evolution doesn't tell\nus the backstory, right? So the theory of evolution\nis not going to be adequate to tell you what is that backstory? It's gonna say that whatever reality is, and that's the interesting thing. It says whatever reality\nis, you don't see it, you see a user interface, but it doesn't tell you\nwhat that user interface is, how it's built. Right, now we can try to look at certain aspects of the interface, but already we're gonna\nlook at that and go, before I would look at neurons and I was assuming that\nI was seeing something that was at least partially true, and now I'm realizing\nit could be like looking at the pixels on my desktop,\nor icons on my desktop, and good luck going from\nthat to the data structures, and then the voltages, and\nthe, I mean, good luck. There's just no way. So what's interesting about this is that our scientific theories are precise enough and rigorous enough to\ntell us certain limits, and even limits of the\ntheories themselves, but they're not going to tell\nus what the next move is. And that's where scientific\ncreativity comes in. So the stuff that I'm\nsaying here, for example, is not alien to physicists. The physicists are saying\nprecisely the same thing, that space time is doomed. We've assumed that space\ntime is fundamental. That we've assumed that\nfor several centuries, and it's been very useful. So all the things that you're mentioning, the particles and all the\nwork that's been done, that's all been done in space time. But now physicists are\nsaying space time is doomed. There's no such thing as\nspace time fundamentally in the laws of physics. And that comes actually out of gravity together with quantum field theory. It just comes right out of it. It's a theorem of those\ntwo theories put together, but it doesn't tell you what's behind it. So the physicists know\nthat the best theories, Einstein's gravity and quantum\nfield theory put together entail that space time\ncannot be fundamental and therefore particles in space\ntime cannot be fundamental. They're just irreducible representations of the symmetries of space time. That's what they are. So space time, so we put the two together. We put together what the\nphysicists are discovering, and we can talk about how they do that. And then the new discoveries from evolution to natural selection, both of these discoveries are\nreally in the last 20 years. And what both are saying is\nspace time has had a good ride, it's been very useful,\nreductionism has been useful, but it's over, and it's\ntime for us to go beyond. - When you say space time\nis doomed, is it the space, is it the time, is it the\nvery hardcoded specification of four dimensions, or are you specifically referring to the kind of perceptual domain that humans operate in,\nwhich is space time? You think there's a 3D, like our world is three dimensional and time progresses forward, therefore three dimensions plus one, 4D. What exactly do you mean by space time? What do you mean by space time is doomed? - Great, great. So this is by the way, not my quote. This is from, for\nexample, Nima Arkani-Hamed at the Institute for\nAdvanced Study at Princeton. Ed Witten also there, David\nGross, Nobel Prize winner. So this is not just something\nthe cognitive scientists, this is what the physicists are saying. - Yeah, the physicists\nare space time skeptics. - Yeah, they're saying that, and I can say exactly why\nthey think it's doomed, but what they're saying is that, because your question was\nwhat aspect of space time? What are we talking about here? It's both space and time. Their union into space\ntime, as Einstein's theory, that's doomed. And they're basically saying\nthat even quantum theory, this is with Nima Arkani-Hamed especially, so Hilbert spaces will\nnot be fundamental either. So the notion of Hilbert space, which is really critical\nto quantum field theory, quantum information theory, that's not going to figure in the fundamental new laws of physics. So what they're looking for is some new mathematical structures beyond space time, beyond Einstein's four\ndimensional space time, or super symmetric version, geometric algebra signature, 2, 4 kind of, there are different ways\nthat you can represent it, but they're finding new structures, and by the way, they're succeeding now. They found something\ncalled the Amplituhedron, this is Nima and his colleagues,\nthe cosmological polytopes. So there are these like polytopes, these polyhedra in multidimensions, generalizations of simplicities,\nthat are coding for, for example, the scattering\namplitudes of processes in the large Hadron collider\nand other colliders. So they're finding that if they let go of space time completely,\nthey're finding new ways of computing these scattering amplitudes that turn literally billions\nof terms into one term. When you do it in space and time, because it's the wrong framework, it's just a user interface, that's now from the\nevolutionary point of view, it's just user interface, it's not a deep insight\ninto the nature of reality. So it's missing, deep symmetry is something\ncalled a dual conformal symmetry, which turns out to be true\nof the scattering data, but you can't see it in space time. And it's making the computations\nway too complicated, 'cause you're trying to\ncompute all the loops, and fineman diagrams, and\nall the fineman integrals. So see, the fineman approach\nto the scattering amplitudes is trying to enforce two critical\nproperties of space time, locality and unitarity. And so when you enforce\nthose, you get all these loops and multiple different levels of loops. And for each of those\nyou have to add new terms to your computation. But when you do it outside of space time, you don't have the notion of unitarity, you don't have the notion of locality. You have something deeper, and it's capturing some symmetries that are actually true of the data. But then when you look at the geometry of the facets of these polytopes, then certain of them will code\nfor unitarity and locality. So it actually comes out of the structure of these deep polytopes. So what we're finding is\nthere's this whole new world now beyond space time that is making explicit symmetries that are true of the data that cannot be seen in space time. And that is turning the\ncomputations from billions of terms to one or two or a handful of terms. So we're getting insights into symmetries, and all of a sudden the\nmath is becoming simple, because we're not doing something silly. We're not adding up all\nthese loops in space time. We're doing something far deeper. But they don't know what\nthis world is about all. So they're in an interesting position where we know that space time is doomed, and I should probably\ntell you why it's doomed, what they're saying about why it's doomed. But they need a flashlight\nto look beyond space time. What flashlight are we gonna use to look into the dark beyond space time? Because Einstein's\ntheory and quantum theory can't tell us what's beyond them. All they can do is tell us\nthat when you put us together, space time is doomed at 10\nto the minus 33 centimeters, 10 to the minus 43 seconds. Beyond that space time\ndoesn't even make sense. It's just has no operational definition. So, but it doesn't tell you what's beyond. And so they're just looking\nfor deep structures, like guessing. It's really fun. So these really brilliant guys, generic. Brilliant men and women\nwho are doing this work, physicists, are making guesses\nabout these structures, informed guesses. Because they're trying to ask, well, okay, what deeper structure could give us the stuff that we're seeing in space time, but without certain commitments that we have to make in space time, like locality and unitarity? So they make these brilliant guesses, and of course, most of the\ntime you're gonna be wrong, but once you get one or\ntwo that start to pay off and then you get some lucky breaks. So they got a lucky break back in 1986. A couple of mathematicians\nnamed Park and Taylor took the scattering\namplitude for two gluons coming in and high energy and four gluons going out at low energy. So that kind of scattering thing. So it's like, apparently for\npeople who are into this, that's sort of something\nthat happens so often, you need to be able to find\nit and get rid of those, because you already know\nabout that and you need to, so you needed to compute them. It was billions of terms. And they couldn't do it, even the supercomputers couldn't do that for the many billions or\nmillions of times per second they needed to do it. So they begged, the experimentalists\nbegged the theorists, please can you, you gotta. And so Park and Taylor\ntook the billions of terms, hundreds of pages, and miraculously they turned it into nine. And then a little bit later\nthey guessed one term expression that turned out to be equivalent. So billions of terms reduced to one term, that so-called famous\nPark-Taylor Formula, 1986. And that was like, okay,\nwhere did that come from? This is a pointer into a deep\nrealm beyond space and time, but no one, I mean,\nwhat can you do with it? And they thought maybe it was a one-off. But then other formulas started coming up. And then eventually Nima\nArkani-Hamed and his team found this thing called the amplituhedron, which really sort of captures a big part of the whole ball of wax. I'm sure they would say, no,\nthere's plenty more to do. So I won't say they did\nit all by any means. They're looking at the\ncosmological polytope as well. So what's remarkable to me is that two pillars of modern science, quantum field theory with\ngravity on the one hand and evolution by natural\nselection on the other, just in the last 20 years\nhave very clearly said, space time has had a good run. Reductionism has been a\nfantastic methodology. So we had a great ontology of space time, a great methodology of reductionism. Now it's time for a new trick, but now you need to go deeper and show, but by the way, this is\ndoesn't mean we throw away everything we've done. Not by a long shot. Every new idea that we come\nup with beyond space time must project precisely into space time, and it better give us back everything that we know\nand love in space time, or generalizations, or it's not gonna be taken\nseriously and it shouldn't be. So we have a strong constraint on whatever we're going\nto do beyond space time. It needs to project into space time. And whatever this deeper theory is, it may not itself have\nevolution of natural selection. This may not be part of this deeper realm, but when we take the whatever\nthat thing is beyond time and project it into space time, it has to look like evolution\nby natural selection or it's wrong. So that's a strong\nconstraint on this work. - So even the evolution\nby natural selection and quantum field theory\ncould be interfaces into something that\ndoesn't look anything like, like you mentioned, I mean\nit's interesting to think that evolution might be\na very crappy interface into something much deeper. - That's right, they're both telling us that the framework that\nyou've had can only go so far, and it has to stop, and\nthere's something beyond. And that framework, the very framework that is space and time itself. Now of course evolution\nby natural selection is not telling us about like Einstein's relativistic space time. So that was another question\nyou asked a little bit earlier. It's telling us more about\nour perceptual space and time, which we have used as\nthe basis for creating first the Newtonian space versus time, as a mathematical extension\nof our perceptions. And then Einstein then took that and extended it even further. So the relationship between\nwhat evolution is telling us and what the physicists are telling us is that in some sense the\nNewton and Einstein space time are formulated as sort\nof rigorous extensions of our perceptual space, making it mathematically rigorous and laying out the symmetries\nthat they find there. So that's sort of the\nrelationship between them. So it's the perceptual space time that evolution is telling us is just a user interface effectively. And then the physicists are finding that even the mathematical\nextension of that into the Einsteinian\nformulation has to be, as well, not the final story. There's something deeper. - So let me ask you about\nreductionism and interfaces as we march forward from Newtonian physics to quantum mechanics. These are all, in your view, interfaces. Are we getting closer\nto objective reality? How do we know if these interfaces, in the process of science, the reason we like those interfaces is because they're\npredictive of some aspects, strongly predictive about\nsome aspects of our reality. Is that completely deviating from our understanding of that reality? Or is it helping us get\ncloser and closer and closer? - Well, of course one critical constraint on all of our theories is that\nthey are empirically tested and pass the experiments\nthat we have for them. So no one's arguing against\nexperiments being important and wanting to test all\nof our current theories and any new theories on that. So that's all there. We have good reason to believe that science will never\nget a theory of everything. - [Lex] Everything, everything. - Everything, everything, right. A final theory of everything, right? I think that my own\ntake for what it's worth is that Godel's incompleteness theorem sort of points us in that direction. Even with mathematics,\nany finite eczemetization that's sophisticated enough\nto be able to do arithmetic, it's easy to show that there'll\nbe statements that are true, that can't be proven, can't be deduced from within that framework. And if you add the new\nstatements to your axioms, then there'll be always new\nstatements that are true but can't be proven\nwith a new axiom system. And the best scientific theories\nin physics, for example, and also now evolution are mathematical. So our theories are gonna be, they're gonna have their own assumptions, and they'll be mathematically precise, and they'll be theories\nperhaps of everything except those assumptions. Because the assumptions are, we say, please grant me these assumptions. If you grant me these assumptions, then I can explain this other stuff. So you have the assumptions\nthat are like miracles as far as the theory is concerned. They're not explained,\nthey're the starting points for explanation. And then you have the\nmathematical structure of the theory itself, which\nwill have the Godel limits. And so my take is that\nreality, whatever it is, is always going to transcend\nany conceptual theory that we can come up with. - There's always gonna be\nmystery at the edges, right? Contradictions and all that kind of stuff. - [Donald] And truths. - So there's this idea that is brought up in the financial space of\nsettlement of transactions. It's often talked about in\ncryptocurrency especially. So you could do money, cash\nis not connected to anything. It used to be connected to\ngold, to physical reality. But then you can use money to\nexchange value, to transact. So when it was on the gold standard, the money would represent some\nstable component of reality. Isn't it more effective to\navoid things like hyperinflation if we generalize that idea? Isn't it better to connect your, whatever we humans are doing\nin the social interaction space with each other, isn't it better from an evolutionary perspective to connect it to some degree to reality? So that the transactions are settled with something that's universal as opposed to us constantly operating in something that's a complete illusion. Isn't it easy to hyperinflate that, like where you really\ndeviate very, very far away from the underlying reality? Or do you never get in trouble for this? Can you just completely\ndrift far, far away from the underlying reality\nand never get in trouble? - That's a great question. On the financial side,\nthere's two levels at least that we could take your question. One is strictly like\nevolutionary psychology of financial systems. And that's pretty interesting. And there, the decentralized\nidea that defy kind of idea in cryptocurrencies may make good sense from just an evolutionary\npsychology point of view. Having human nature being what it is, putting a lot of faith in\na few central controllers depends a lot on the veracity of those and trustworthiness of those\nfew central controllers. And we have ample evidence time and again that that's often betrayed. So it makes good evolutionary\nsense, I would say, to have a decentralized, I mean, democracy is a step in\nthat direction, right? We don't have a monarch\nnow telling us what to do. We decentralize things, right? Because if the monarch, if\nyou have Marcus Aurelius as you're emperor, you're great. If you have Nero, it's not so great. And so we don't want that. So democracy is a step in that direction. But I think the defy thing\nis an even bigger step and is is going to even\nmake the democratization even greater. So that's one level. - Also the fact that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely is also a consequence of evolution. That's also a feature I think, right? You can argue from the long\nspan of living organisms, it's nice for power to corrupt. So mad men and women throughout history might be useful to teach us a lesson. - We could learn from\nour negative example. - [Lex] Exactly. - So power does corrupt, and I think that you can\nthink about that again from an evolutionary point of view, but I think that your\nquestion was a little deeper. That was, does the\nevolutionary interface idea sort of unhinge science from\nsome kind of important test for the theories, right? Doesn't mean that anything\ngoes in scientific theory, but there's no, if we don't see the truth, is there no way to tether\nour theories and test them? And I think there's no problem there. We can only test things in\nterms of what we can measure with our senses in space and time. So we are going to have to\ncontinue to do experiments, but we're gonna understand\na little bit differently what those experiments are. We had thought that when we see a pointer on some machine in an experiment that the machine exists,\nthe pointer exists, and the values exist even\nwhen no one is looking at them and that they're an objective truth. And our best theorists are telling us no. Pointers are just pointers, and that's what you have to rely on for making your judgements. But that even the pointers themselves are not the objective reality. And I think Godel is telling us not that anything goes, but you know, as you develop new axiom systems, you'll find out what goes\nwithin that axiom system and what testable\npredictions you can make. So I don't think we're untethered. We continue to do experiments, but I think we won't have that we want is a conceptual understanding that gives us a theory of everything that's final and complete. I think that this is,\nto put it another way, this is job security for scientists. Our job, will never be done, is job security for neuroscience. Because before we thought that\nwhen we looked in the brain, we saw neurons and neural networks and axion potentials and\nsynapses and so forth, and that was it. That that was the reality. Now we have to reverse engineer that. We have to say what is beyond space time? What is going on? What is a dynamical\nsystem beyond space time, that when we project it\ninto Einstein space time, gives us things that look like neurons, and neural networks, and synapses. So we have to reverse engineer it. So there's gonna be lots\nmore work for neuroscience. It's gonna be far more\ncomplicated, and difficult, and challenging. But that's wonderful. That's what we need to do. We thought neurons exist\nwhen they aren't perceived, and they don't. In the same way that if I show you, when I say they don't exist, I should be very, very concrete. If I draw on a piece of\npaper a little sketch of something that is\ncalled the Necker cube, it's just a little line drawing of a cube. It's on a flat piece of paper. If I execute it well and I show it to you, you'll see a 3D cube. And you'll see it flip, sometimes you'll see one face in front, sometimes you'll see\nthe other face in front. But if I ask you which face is in front when you don't look? The answer is, well\nneither face is in front, 'cause there's no cube, there's\njust a flat piece of paper. So when you look at the piece of paper, you perceptually create the cube, and when you look at it,\nthen you fix one face to be in front and one face to the other. So that's what I mean when\nI say it doesn't exist. Space time itself is like the cube. It's a data structure that\nyour sensory systems construct, whatever your sensory systems mean now. Because we now have to\neven take that for granted. But there are perceptions\nthat you construct on the fly, and they're data structures\nin the computer science sense, and you garbage collect them\nwhen you don't need them. So you create them and\ngarbage collect them. - But is it possible that it's mapped well in some concrete, predictable\nway to objective reality? The sheet of paper, the\ntwo dimensional space, or we can talk about space time, maps in some way that we\nmaybe don't yet understand, but will one day understand\nwhat that mapping is. But it maps reliably, it\nis tethered in that way. - Well, yes, and so the new theories that the physicists are\nfinding beyond space time have that kind of tethering. So they show precisely how you\nstart with an amplituhedron and how you project this\nhigh dimensional structure into the four dimensions of space time. So there's a precise procedure\nthat relates the two. And they're doing the same thing with the cosmological polytopes. So they're the ones that are making the most\nconcrete and fun advances going beyond space time. And there they're tethering it, right? They say this is precisely\nthe mathematical projection from this deeper\nstructure into space time. One thing I'll say about,\nas a non physicist, what I find interesting\nis that they're finding just geometry, but there's\nno notion of dynamics. Right now they're just\nfinding these static geometric structures, which is impressive. I'm not putting them down. What they're doing is\nunbelievably complicated, and brilliant, and adventurous. It's all those things. - And beautiful. - [Donald] And beautiful, yeah, right. - From a human aesthetic perspective, 'cause geometry is beautiful. - Absolutely. And they're finding symmetries\nthat are true of the data that can't be seen in space time. But I'm looking for a\ntheory beyond space time that's a dynamical theory. I would love to find, and we can talk about that at some point, a theory of consciousness in which the dynamics\nof consciousness itself will give rise to the geometry that the physicists are\nfinding beyond space time. If we can do that, then we'd\nhave a completely different way of looking at how\nconsciousness is related to what we call the brain\nor the physical world more generally. Right now, all of my brilliant colleagues, well 99% of them are trying to, they're assuming space\ntime is fundamental. They're assuming that\nparticles are fundamental, quarks, gluons, leptons and so forth. Elements, atoms and so\nforth are fundamental. And that therefore neurons and brains are part of objective reality. And that somehow when you get matter that's complicated enough, it will somehow generate\nconscious experiences by its functional properties. Or if you're panpsychist,\nmaybe in addition to the physical properties of particles, you add a consciousness property as well. And then you combine these\nphysical and conscious properties to get more complicated ones, but they're all doing\nit within space time. All of the work that's\nbeing done on consciousness and its relationship to the brain has all assumed something\nthat our best theories are telling us is doomed, space time. - Why does that particular\nassumption bother you the most? So you bring up space time,\nI mean that's just one useful interface we've\nused for a long time. Surely there's other interfaces. Is space time just the one of the big ones to build up people's\nintuition about the fact that they just do assume\na lot of things strongly? Or is it in fact the fundamental flaw in the way we see the world? - Well, everything else\nthat we think we know are things in space time. - [Lex] Sure. - And so, when you say\nspace time is doomed, this is a shot to the heart\nof the whole framework, the whole conceptual framework\nthat we've had in science. Not to the scientific method, but to the fundamental ontology and also the fundamental methodology. The ontology of space\ntime and its contents and the methodology of reductionism, which is that as we go to\nsmaller scales in space time, we will find more and\nmore fundamental laws. And that's been very useful for the space and time for centuries, reductionism for centuries. But now we realize that that's over. Reductionism is in fact\ndead, as is space time. - What exactly is reductionism? What is the process of reductionism that is different than\nsome of the physicists that you mentioned that\nare trying to think, trying to let go of the\nassumption of space time? Like beyond, isn't that\nstill trying to come up with a simple model that\nexplains this whole thing? Isn't it still reducing? - It's a wonderful question\nbecause it really helps to clarify two different notions, which is scientific\nexplanation on the one hand and a particular kind of\nscientific explanation on the other, which is the reductionist. So the reductionist explanation is saying, I will start with things that\nare smaller in space time and therefore more fundamental, and where the laws are more fundamental. So we go to just smaller\nand smaller scales. Whereas in science, more\ngenerally we just say, like when Einstein did the\nspecial theory of relativity, he's saying, let me have\na couple postulates. I will assume that the\nspeed of light is universal for all observers in uniform motion. And that the laws of physics for uniform motion are relative. That's not reductionist. That those are saying,\ngrant me these assumptions, I can build this entire concept\nof space time out of it. It's not a reductionist thing. You're not going to smaller\nand smaller scales of space. You're coming up with these\ndeep, deep principles. Same thing with this\ntheory of gravity, right? It's the falling elevator idea, right? So this is not a\nreductionist kind of thing. It's something different. - Simplification is a bigger\nthing than just reductionism. - Yeah, reductionism has\nbeen a particularly useful kind of scientific explanation, for example, in thermodynamics, right? Where the notion that we have of heat, some macroscopic thing\nlike temperature and heat, it turns out that Neil\nBoltzmann and others discover, well hey, if we go to\nsmaller and smaller scales, we find these things\ncalled molecules or atoms. And if we think of them\nas bouncing around, having some kind of energy,\nthen what we call heat really can be reduced to to that. And so that's a particularly\nuseful kind of reduction is a useful kind of scientific explanation that works within a range\nof scales within space time. But we know now precisely\nwhere that has to stop, at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and 10 to the minus 43 seconds. And I would be impressed if it was 10 to the minus\n33 trillion centimeters. I'm not terribly impressed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters. - I don't even know how to comprehend either of those numbers, frankly. Just a small aside, because I am a computer science person, I also find cellular automata beautiful. And so you have somebody\nlike Stephen Wolfram, who recently has been\nvery excitedly exploring a proposal for a data structure\nthat could be the numbers that would make you a little\nbit happier in terms of scale. Because they're very,\nvery, very, very tiny. Do you like this space of\nexploration of really thinking, letting go of space time,\nletting go of everything and trying to think what\nkind of data structures could be underneath this whole mess? - That's right, so if\nthey're thinking about these as outside of space time, then\nthat's what we have to do. That's what our best\ntheories are telling us. You now have to think\noutside of space time. Now, of course I should back up and say, we know that Einstein\nsurpassed Newton, right? But that doesn't mean\nthat there's not good work to do in Newton. There's all sorts of Newtonian physics that takes us to the moon and so forth. And there's lots of good\nproblems that we want to solve with Newtonian physics. The same thing will be true of space time. It's not like we're gonna\nstop using space time. We'll continue to do all\nsorts of good work there. But for those scientists\nwho are really looking to go deeper, to actually find the next, just like what Einstein did to Newton, what are we gonna do to Einstein? How do we get beyond\nEinstein and quantum theory to something deeper? Then we have to actually let go. And if we're gonna do like\nthis automata kind of approach, it is critical that it's\nnot automata in space time. It's automata prior to space time from which we're going to\nshow how space time emerges. If you're doing within space time, well that might be a fun model, but it's not the radical\nnew step that we need. - Yeah, so the space\ntime emerges from that, whatever system. Like you're saying it's\na dynamical system. Do we even have an understanding\nwhat dynamical means when we go beyond? When you start to think about dynamics, it could mean a lot of things. Even causality could mean a lot of things if we realize that everything's\nan interface, right? Like how much do we really know is an interesting question,\nbecause you brought up neurons. I gotta ask you on another,\nagain, another tangent. There's a paper I remember\na while ago looking at, could a neuroscientist\nunderstand a microprocessor? And I just enjoyed that thought experiment that they provided,\nwhich is they basically, it's a couple of neuroscientists, Eric Jonas and Conrad Cording, who used the tools of neuroscience to analyze a microprocessor. So a computer, computer chip. - Now if we lesion it here,\nwhat happens, and so forth. And if you go and lesion into computer, it's very, very clear that\nlesion experiments on computers are not gonna give you a lot\nof insight into how it works. - And also the measurement devices, and the kind of, just\nusing the basic approaches of neuroscience, collecting\nthe data, trying to intuit about the underlying function of it. And that helps you understand that our scientific exploration of concepts, depending on the field, are maybe in the very, very early stages. I wouldn't say it leads us astray, perhaps it does sometimes, but it's not anywhere close\nto some fundamental mechanism that actually makes a thing work. I don't know if you can\nsort of comment on that in terms of using\nneuroscience to understand the human mind and neurons. Are we really far away potentially from understanding in\nthe way we understand the transistors enough to\nbe able to build a computer? So one thing about understanding is you can understand for fun, the other one is to understand so you could build things. And that's when you\nreally have to understand. - Exactly. In fact, what got me into the field at MIT was work by David Maher\non this very topic. So David Maher was professor at MIT, but he'd done his PhD in neuroscience, studying just the\narchitectures of the brain. But he realized that his work, it was on the cerebellum. He realized that his work,\nas rigorous as it was, left him unsatisfied,\nbecause he didn't know what the cerebellum was for and why it had that architecture. And so he went to MIT and\nhe was in the AI lab there, and he said he had this\nthree level approach that really grabbed my attention. So when I was an undergrad at UCLA, I read one of his papers\nin a class and said, who is this guy? Because he said, you have to\nhave a computational theory. What is being computed and why? An algorithm, well how\nis it being computed? What are the precise algorithms? And then the hardware, how does it get instantiated\nin the hardware? And so to really to do\nneuroscience, he argued, we needed to have understanding\nat all those levels. And that really got me,\nI loved the neuroscience, but I realized this guy was\nsaying, if you can't build it, you don't understand it effectively. And so that's why I went to MIT, and I had the pleasure\nof working with David until he died just a\nyear and a half later. So there's been that idea\nthat with neuroscience, we have to have in some\nsense a top-down model of what's being computed and why that we would then go after. And the same thing with the\ntrying to reverse engineer a computing system like your laptop. We really need to understand what the user interface\nis about, and why we have, what are keys on the\nkeyboard for and so forth. You need to know why to really\nunderstand all the circuitry and what it's for. Now we don't, evolution\nand natural selection does not tell us the deeper\nquestion that we're asking, the answer to the deeper question, which is why? What's this deeper reality,\nand what's it up to, and why? All it tells us is that\nwhatever reality is, it's not what you see. What you see is just an adaptive fiction. - So just to linger on this\nfascinating bold question that shakes you out of your dream state, does this fiction still help\nyou in building intuitions as literary fiction does about reality? The reason we read literary\nfiction is it helps us build intuitions and understanding\nand in indirect ways, sneak up to the difficult\nquestions of human nature. Great fiction. Same with this observed reality. Does this interface that we get, this fictional interface\nhelp us build intuition about deeper truths of\nhow this whole mess works? - Well, I think that each\ntheory that we propose will give its own answer\nto that question, right? So when the physicists are\nproposing these structures, like the amplituhedron,\nand cosmological polytope, associohedron, and so\nforth beyond space time, we can then ask your question\nfor those specific structures and say, how much\ninformation, for example, does evolution by natural selection and the the kinds of sensory\nsystems that we have right now give us about this deeper reality? And why did we evolve this way? We can try to answer that\nquestion from within the deeper. So there's not gonna be a general answer. I think we're going to, what\nwe'll have to do is posit these new deeper theories, and then try to answer your question within the framework of\nthose deeper theories, knowing full well that there'll\nbe an even deeper theory. - So is this paralyzing, though? Because how do we know\nwe're not completely adrift, out to sea, lost forever? That our theories are completely lost. So if we can never truly,\ndeeply introspect to the bottom, if it's always just turtles\non top of turtles infinitely, isn't that paralyzing\nfor the scientific mind? - Well it's interesting that you say introspect to the bottom\nbecause there is that, there is one, I mean, again,\nthis is in the same spirit of what I said before, which is it depends on what answer you give to\nwhat's beyond space time, what answer we would\ngive to your question. So, but one answer that\nis interesting to explore is something that spiritual\ntraditions have said for thousands of years,\nbut haven't said precisely. So we can't take it seriously in science until it's made precise, but we might be able to make it precise. And that is that they've also said something like space and\ntime aren't fundamental. They're maya, they're illusion. But if you look inside, if you introspect and let go of all of your\nparticular perceptions, you will come to something\nthat's beyond conceptual thought. And that is, they claim, being in contact with the deep ground of\nbeing that transcends any particular conceptual understanding. If that is correct, now I'm not saying it's correct, but, and I'm not saying it's not correct, I'm just saying if that's correct, then it would be the\ncase that as scientists, because we also are in touch\nwith this ground of being, we would then not be able to conceptually understand\nourselves all the way. But we could know ourselves\njust by being ourselves. And so there would be a sense in which there is a fundamental grounding\nto the whole enterprise, because we're not separate\nfrom the enterprise. This is the opposite of\nimpersonal third person science. This would make science be personal, personal all the way down,\nbut nevertheless scientific because the scientific\nmethod would still be what we would use all the way down for the conceptual understanding. - Unfortunately, you still don't know if you went all the way down. It's possible that this kind\nof, whatever consciousness is, and we'll talk about it, is\ngetting the cliche statement of be yourself. It is somehow digging\nat a deeper of reality. But you still don't know\nwhen you get to the bottom. You know, a lot of people,\nthey'll take psychedelic drugs and they'll say, well that\ntakes my mind to certain places where it feels like that is revealing some deeper truth of reality. But you still, it could be\ninterfaces on top of interfaces. In your view of this,\nyou really don't know. I mean it's Godel's incompleteness is that you really don't know. - My own view on it, for what it's worth, 'cause I don't know the right\nanswer, but my own view on it right now is that it's never ending. I think that there will\nnever, that this is great, as I said before, great\njob security for science, and that if this is true, and if consciousness is somehow important or fundamental in the universe, this may be an important fundamental fact about consciousness itself that it's a never ending\nexploration that's going on in some sense. - Well that's interesting. Lemme push back on the job security. So maybe as we understand\nthis kind of idea deeper and deeper, we\nunderstand that the pursuit is not a fruitful one,\nthat maybe we need to, maybe that's why we don't\nsee aliens everywhere. As you get smarter and\nsmarter and smarter, you realize that like exploration is, there's other fun ways to\nspend your time than exploring. You could be sort of living\nmaximally in some way that's not exploration. I could, there's all kinds of\nvideo games you can construct and put yourself inside of them that don't involve you going\noutside of the game world. It's feeling, for my human perspective, what seems to be fun\nis challenging yourself and overcoming those challenges, so you can constantly\nartificially generate challenges for yourself like\nSisyphus and his Boulder. And that's it. So the scientific method\nthat's always reaching out to the stars, that's\nalways trying to figure out the puzzle upon a puzzle, always trying to get to the bottom turtle. Maybe if we can build more and more the intuition that that's\nan infinite pursuit, we agree to start deviating\nfrom that pursuit, start enjoying the here and now versus the looking out\ninto the unknown always. Maybe looking out into the\nunknown is a early activity for a species that's evolved. I'm just sort of saying, pushing back as you probably got a\nlot of scientists excited in terms of job security. I could envision where\nit's not job security, where scientists become\nmore and more useless. Maybe they're like the\nholders of the ancient wisdom that allows us to study our own history, but not much more than that. Just to pushback. - Well, that's good pushback. I'll put one in there\nfor the scientists again. But sure, but then I'll\ntake the other side too. So when Faraday did\nall of his experiments, with magnets and electricity and so forth, he came up with all this\nwonderful empirical data and James Clark Maxwell looked at it and wrote down a few equations, which we can now write\ndown in a single equation. The Maxwell equation, if we\nused geometrical algebra, just one equation. That opened up unbelievable technologies where people are resuming\nand talking to each other around the world, the\nwhole electronics industry. There was something that\ntransformed our lives in a very positive way. With the theories beyond space\ntime, here's one potential. Right now, most of the\ngalaxies that we see, we can see them, but we know\nthat we could never get to them no matter how fast we traveled. They're going away from us at\nthe speed of light or beyond. So we can't ever get to them. So there's all this beautiful real estate that's just smiling and waving at us, and we can never get to it. But that's if we go through space time. But if we recognize that space time is just a data structure,\nit's not fundamental, we're not little things inside space time, space time is a little data\nstructure in our perceptions. It's just the other way around. Once we understand that\nand we get equations for the stuff that's beyond space time, maybe we won't have to\ngo through space time. Maybe we can go around it. Maybe I can go to Proxima\nCentauri and not go through space. I can just go right there directly. If it's a data structure we\ncan start to play with it. So I think that, for what it's worth, my take would be that the\nendless sequence of theories that we could contemplate building will lead to an endless sequence\nof new remarkable insights into the potentialities, the possibilities that would seem miraculous to us. And that we will be motivated to continue the exploration partly just for the technological\ninnovations that come out. But the other thing that\nyou mentioned though, what about just being? What if we decide instead of\nall this doing and exploring, what about being? My guess is that the best\nscientists will do both, and that the act of being will be a place where they get many of their ideas, that they then pull into\nthe conceptual realm. And I think many of the best scientists, Einstein comes to mind, right? Where these guys say, look, I didn't come up with these\nideas by a conceptual analysis. I was thinking in vague images and it was just something non-conceptual. And then it took me a long, long time to pull it out into concepts and then longer to put it into math. But the real insights didn't come from just slavishly\nplaying with equations. They came from a deeper place. And so there may be this\ngoing back and forth between the complete non-conceptual, where there's essentially\nno end to the wisdom, and then conceptual systems where there's the Godel\nlimits that we have to that. And that maybe if\nconsciousness is important and fundamental, that\nmaybe what consciousness, at least part of what\nconsciousness is about, is this discovering itself, discovering its\npossibilities, so to speak. And we can talk about what that might mean by going from the\nnon-conceptual to the conceptual and back and forth. - [Lex] To get better and\nbetter and better at being. - Right. - Let me ask you just, just\nto linger on the evolutionary, because you mentioned\nevolutionary game theory and that's really the perspective from which you come to form\nthe case against reality. At which point in our evolutionary history did we start to deviate\nthe most from reality? Is it way before life\neven originated on earth? Is it in the early development\nfrom bacteria and so on? Or is it when some inklings of what we think of as intelligence or maybe even complex\nconsciousness started to emerge? So where did this deviation, just like with the\ninterfaces on in a computer, you know, you start with transistors, and then you have assembly, and then you have C, C++,\nthen you have Python, then you have GUIs and all that kind, you have layers upon layers. When did we start to deviate? - Well, David Maher,\nagain, my advisor at MIT, in his book \"Vision\" suggested that the more primitive sensory\nsystems were less realistic, less vertical. But that by the time you got to something as complicated as the humans, we were actually estimating\nthe true shapes and distances to objects and so forth. So his point of view, and\nI think it was probably, it is not an uncommon\nview among my colleagues that, yeah, the sensory\nsystems of lower creatures may just not be complicated\nenough to give them much truth. But as you get to 86 billion neurons, you can now compute the truth or at least the parts of\nthe truth that we need. When I look at evolutionary game theory, one of my graduate students, Justin Mark, did some simulations\nusing genetic algorithms. So there he was just exploring, we start off with random organisms, random sensory genetics\nand random actions. And first generation was unbelievably, it was a foraging situation. There were foraging for resources, and most of them stayed in one place, didn't do anything important. But we could then just look\nat how the genes evolved, and what we found was, what he found, was that basically you never even saw the truth organisms\neven come on the stage. If they came, they were\ngone in one generation. They just weren't. So they came and gone. They came and went, even\njust in one generation, they just are not good enough. The ones that were just\ntracking their senses, just were tracking the fitness payoffs, were far more fit than the truth seekers. So an answer at one level, I'm gonna give an answer\nat a deeper level, but just with evolutionary game theory. Because my attitude as a scientist is, I don't believe any of our theories. I take them very, very seriously. I study them, I look\nat their implications, but none of them are the gospel. They're just the latest\nideas that we have. And so the reason I study\nevolutionary game theory is because that's the best tool we have right now in this area. There is nothing else that competes. And so as a scientist,\nit's my responsibility to take the best tools\nand see what they mean. And the same thing the\nphysicists are doing, they're taking the best tools and looking at what they entail. But I think that science\nnow has enough experience to realize that we should\nnot believe our theories in the sense that we've now arrived. In 1890, it was a lot of\nphysicists thought we'd arrived, they were discouraging\nbright young students from going into physics,\nbecause it was all done. And that's precisely the wrong attitude. Forever, this is the\nwrong attitude forever. The attitude we should have\nis, a century from now, they'll be looking at us and laughing at what we didn't know. And we just have to assume that\nthat's going to be the case. Just know that everything that we think is so brilliant right now, our\nfinal theory of everything, a century from now, they'll look at us like we\nlook at the physicists of 1890 and go, how could they have been so dumb? So I don't wanna make that mistake. So I'm not doctrinaire about any of our current\nscientific theories. I'm doctrinaire about this, we should use the best\ntools we have right now. That's what we've got. - And with humility. Well, so let me ask you about game theory. I love game theory,\nevolutionary game theory, but I'm always suspicious\nof it, like economics. When you construct models, it's\ntoo easy to construct things that oversimplify just because we, our human brains enjoy the simplification of constructing a few variables that somehow represent\norganisms or represent people. And running a simulation\nthat then allows you to build up intuition. And then it feels really good because you just can get some really deep and surprising intuitions. But how do you know the\nassumptions underlying your models aren't fundamentally flawed? And because of that, your conclusions are fundamentally flawed. So I guess, yes, my question is, what are the limits in\nyour use of game theory, evolutionary game theory,\nyour experience with it, what are the limits of game theory? - So I've gotten some pushback\nfrom professional colleagues and friends who have\ntried to rerun simulations and try to, I mean, the idea\nthat we don't see the truth is not comfortable. And so many of my colleagues\nare very interested in trying to show that we're wrong. And so the idea would be to say that somehow we did something, as you're suggesting,\nmaybe something special that wasn't completely general. We've got some little special\npart of the whole search space and evolutionary game theory in which this happens to be true. But more generally, organisms\nwould evolve to see the truth. So the best pushback we've\ngotten is from a team at Yale. And they suggested that if you use thousands of payoff functions, so we, in our simulations, we just use a couple, one or two. Because it was our first\nsimulations, right? So that would be a limit. We had one or two payoff functions. We showed the result in those, at least for the genetic algorithms. And they said, if you have 20,000 of them, then we can find these conditions in which truth seeing organisms would\nbe the ones that evolved and survived. And so we looked at their simulations, and it certainly is the case\nthat you can find special cases in which truth can evolve. So when I say it's probability zero, it doesn't mean it can't happen. It can happen, in fact, it\ncould happen infinitely often, it's just probability of zero. So probability of zero things\ncan happen infinitely often. - When you say probability of zero, you mean probability close to zero? - To be very precise. So for example, if I have\na unit square on the plane, and I use a probability measure in which the area of a\nregion is this probability, then if I draw a curve\nin that unit square, it has a measure precisely zero. Precisely, not approximately,\nprecisely zero. And yet it has infinitely many points. So there's an object that,\nfor that probability measure, has probability zero, and yet there's infinitely\nmany points in it. So that's what I mean\nwhen I say that the things that are probability zero\ncan happen infinitely often in principle. - Yeah, but infinity, as far as I, and I look outside often, I walk around, and I look at people, I haven't ever seen infinity in real life. - That's an interesting issue. - I've been looking, I've been looking. I don't notice it infinitely\nsmall or the infinitely big. And so the tools of mathematics, you could sort of apply\nthe same kind of criticism, that it is a very convenient\ninterface into our reality. - Well, that's a big\ndebate in mathematics. The intuitionist versus the\nones who take, for example, the real numbers as real. And that's a fun discussion. Nicholas Giesen, a physicist,\nhad really interesting work recently on how if you go\nwith Intuitionist mathematics, you could effectively quantize Newton. And you find that Newtonian\ntheory and quantum theory aren't that different once you go with it. - [Lex] That's funny. - It's really quite interesting. So the issue you raised\nis a very, very deep one, and one that I think we\nshould take quite seriously, which is how should we think about the reality of Contra's\nhierarchy, Aliff one, Aliff two, and all these different infinities versus just a more\nalgorithmic approach, right? So where everything's\ncomputable in some sense, everything's finite. As big as you want, but\nnevertheless finite. - So yeah, that ultimately boils down to whether the world is\ndiscreet or continuous in some general sense. And again, we can't really know, but there's just mind breaking thought, just common sense reasoning\nthat something can happen and yet probability of it happening is 0%. That doesn't compute for\na common sense computer. - Right, this is where you have\nto be a sharp mathematician to really, and I'm not. - Sharp is one word. What I'm saying is\ncommon sense computer is, I mean that in a very,\nkinda in a positive sense, because we've been talking\nabout perception systems and interfaces. If we are to reason about the world, we have to use the best interfaces we got. And I'm not exactly sure that game theory is the best interface we got for this. - [Donald] Oh, right. - And application of\nmathematics tricks and tools in mathematics to game\ntheory is the best we got when we are thinking about\nthe nature of reality, and fitness functions,\nand evolution, period. - Well that's a fair rejoinder. And I think that that was\nthe tool that we used. And if someone says, here's\na better mathematical tool and here's why, this\nmathematical tool better captures the essence of Darwin's idea. John Maynard Smith didn't quite get it with evolutionary game theory. There's this better, this thing. Now there are tools like\nevolutionary graph theory, which generalized\nevolutionary game theory, and then there's quantum game theory. So you can use quantum tools,\nlike entanglement for example, as a resource in games\nthat change the very nature of the solutions, the optimal\nsolutions of the game theory. - Well the work from Yale\nis really interesting. It's a really interesting\nchallenge of kind of these ideas where, okay, if you\nhave a very large number of fitness functions,\nor let's say you have a nearly infinite number\nof fitness functions, or a growing number of fitness functions, what kind of interesting\nthings start emerging? If you are to be an organism,\nif to be an organism that adapts means having to deal with an ensemble of fitness functions. - Right, and so we've actually redone some of our own work based on theirs, and this is the back and forth that we expect in science, right? And what we found was\nthat in their simulations, they were assuming that you\ncouldn't carve the world up into objects. And so we said, well, let's\nrelax that assumption. Allow organisms to create data structures that we might call objects. And an object would be, you would do hierarchical clustering of your fitness payoff functions. The ones that have similar shapes, if you have 20,000 of them, maybe these 50 are all very, very similar. So I can take all the\nperception, action, fitness stuff and make that into a data structure, and we'll call that a unit or an object. And as soon as we did that, then all of their results went away. It turned out they were the special case and that the organisms that\nwere allowed to only see, that were shaped to see\nonly fitness payoffs were the ones that were. So the idea is that objects then, what are objects from an\nevolutionary point of view? This bottle, we thought\nthat when I saw a bottle, it was because I was seeing\na true object that existed whether or not it was perceived. Evolutionary theories suggest\na different interpretation. I'm seeing a data\nstructure that is encoding a convenient way of looking\nat various fitness payoffs. I can use this for drinking, I could use it as a weapon,\nnot a very good one. I could beat someone\nover the head with it. If my goal is mating, this is pointless. So I'm seeing, what I'm coding\nhere is all sorts of actions and the payoffs that I could get. When I pick up an apple,\nnow I'm getting a different set of actions and payoffs. When I pick up a rock I'm getting, so for every object, what I'm getting is a different set of payoff\nfunctions with various actions. And so once you allow that,\nthen what you find is, once again, that truth goes extinct. And the organisms that\njust get an interface are the ones that win. - But the question just sneaking up on, this is fascinating, from where do fitness functions originate? What gives birth to the fitness functions? So if there's a giant black box that just keeps giving\nyou fitness functions, what are we trying to optimize? You said that water has\ndifferent uses than an apple. So there's these objects. What are we trying to optimize and why is not reality\na really good generator of fitness functions? - So each theory makes its own assumptions and says, grant me this,\nthen I'll explain that. So evolutionary game theory says, grant me fitness payoffs, and grant me strategies with payoffs, and I can write down a matrix where this strategy\ninteracts with that strategy, these are the payoffs that come up. If you grant me that, then\nI can start to explain a lot of things. Now you can ask for a\ndeeper question like, okay, how does physics evolve biology? And where do these\nfitness payoffs come from? That's a completely different enterprise. And of course evolutionary\ngame theory then would be not be the right tool for that. It would have to be a deeper tool that shows where evolutionary\ngame theory comes from. My own take is that\nthere's gonna be a problem in doing that because space\ntime isn't fundamental, it's just a user interface. And that the distinction that we make between living and non-living is not a fundamental distinction. It's an artifact of the\nlimits of our interface. So this is a new wrinkle, and\nthis is an important wrinkle. It's so nice to take space\nand time as fundamental because if something\nlooks like it's inanimate, it's it's inanimate, and we\ncan just say it's not living. Now it's much more complicated. Certain things are obviously living. I'm talking with you,\nI'm obviously interacting with some something that's\nalive and conscious. - I think we've let go\nof the word \"obviously\" in this conversation. I think nothing is obvious. - Nothing's obvious, that's right. But when we get down to like\nan ant, it's obviously living, but I'll say it appears to be living. But when we get down to a\nvirus, now people wonder. And when we get down to protons, people say it's not living. And my attitude is, look,\nI have a user interface. Interface is there to hide\ncertain aspects of reality and others to, it's an\nuneven representation, put it that way. Certain things just get completely hidden. Dark matter and dark energy\nare most of the energy and matter that's out there. Our interface just plain\nflat out hides them. The only way we get some hint is because gravitational\nthings are going wrong within our. So most things are\noutside of our interface. The distinction between\nliving and non-living is not fundamental. It's an artifact of our interface. So if we really, really want to understand where evolution comes from, to answer the question, the\ndeep question you asked, I think the right way\nwe're gonna have to do that is to come up with a deeper\ntheory than space time in which there may not\nbe the notion of time. And show that whatever the dynamics of that deeper theory is, and by the way, I'll talk about\nhow you could have dynamics without time, but the dynamics\nof this deeper theory, when we project it in certain ways, then we do get space time, and we get what appears to be evolution by natural selection. So I would love to see\nevolution by natural selection, nature red in tooth and claw, people fighting, animals\nfighting for resources and the whole bit, come\nout of a deeper theory in which perhaps it's all cooperation. There's no limited resources and so forth. But as a result of projection,\nyou get space and time, and as a result of projection, you get nature red in tooth\nand claw, the appearance of it. But it's all an artifact of the interface. - I like this idea that the line between living and\nnon-living is very important. Because that's a thing that would emerge before you have evolution,\nthe idea of death. So that seems to be an important component of natural selection. And if that emerged, because that's also asking the question, I guess, that I ask, where do\nfitness functions come from? That's like asking the old\nmeaning of life question, right? It's what's the why? And one of the big underlying whys, okay, you can start with evolution on earth, but without living,\nwithout life and death, without the line between\nthe living and the dead, you don't have evolution. So what if underneath it, there's no such thing as\nthe living and the dead. Like this concept of an organism, period. There's a living organism that's defined by a volume in space time\nthat somehow interacts, that over time maintains\nits integrity, somehow, has some kind of history,\nit has a wall of some kind. The outside world, the environment, and then inside there's an organism. So you're defining an organism, and also you're defining that organism by the fact that it can move and it can become alive,\nwhich you kind of think of as moving combined with the\nfact that it's keeping itself separate from the environment. So you can point out that thing is living and then it can also die. That seems to be all very\npowerful components of space time that enable you to have\nsomething like natural selection and evolution. - Well, and there's a\nlot of interesting work, some of it by collaborators\nof Carl Friston and others where they have Baysnet kind\nof stuff that they build on. And the notion of a Markov blanket. So you have some states\nwithin this network that are inside the blanket,\nthen you have the blanket, and then the states outside the blanket. And the states inside this Markov blanket are conditionally\nindependent of the states outside the blanket,\nconditioned on the blanket. And what they're looking\nat is that the dynamics inside of the states,\ninside the Markov blanket, seem to be trying to estimate\nproperties of the outside and react to them in a way. So it seems like you're doing\nprobabilistic inferences in ways that might be\nable to keep you alive. So there's interesting work\ngoing on in that direction. But what I'm saying is\nsomething slightly different. And that is like, when I look at you, all I see is skin, hair, and eyes, right? That's all I see. But I know that there's a deeper reality. I believe that there's\na much deeper reality. There's the whole world of your\nexperiences, your thoughts, your hopes, your dreams. In some sense the face that I see is just a symbol that I create, right? And as soon as I look\naway, I delete that symbol, but I don't delete you, I don't delete the conscious experience, the whole world of yours, so I'm only deleting an interface symbol, but that interface symbol\nis a portal, so to speak. Not a perfect portal, but a genuine portal into your beliefs, into your conscious experiences. That's why we can have a conversation. We genuinely, your consciousness\nis genuinely affecting mine and mine is genuinely affecting\nyours through these icons which I create on the fly. I mean I create your face\nwhen I look, I delete it. I don't create you, your consciousness, that's there all the time. But I do. So now, when I look at a cat, I'm creating something\nthat I still call living and I still think is conscious. When I look at an ant, I create something that I still would call living,\nbut maybe not conscious. When I look at something I call a virus, now I'm not even sure\nI would call it living. And when I look at a proton, I would say I don't even think, it's not alive at all. It could be that I'm\nnevertheless interacting with something that's\njust as conscious as you. I'm not saying the proton is conscious. The face that I'm creating\nwhen I look at you, that face is not conscious. That face is a data structure in me. That face, it's an experience. It's not an experiencer. Similar, the proton is something\nthat I create when I look or do a collision in the\nLarge Hadron Collider or something like that. But what is behind the\nentity in space time? So I've got this space time interface, and I just got this entity\nthat I call a proton. What is the reality behind it? Well, the physicists are finding\nthese big, big structures, amplituhedron, associohedron. What's behind those\ncould be consciousness, what I'm playing with. In which case, when I'm\ninteracting with a proton, I'm could be interacting\nwith consciousness. Again, to be very, very clear, 'cause it's easy to misunderstand, I'm not saying a proton is conscious, just like I'm not saying\nyour face is conscious. Your face is a symbol I create\nand then delete as I look. And so your face is not conscious, but I know that that face in my interface, the Lex Fridman face that I\ncreate is an interface symbol that's a genuine portal\ninto your consciousness. The portal is less clear for a cat, even less clear for an ant. And by the time we get down to a proton, the portal is not clear at all. But that doesn't mean I'm not interacting with consciousness, it just\nmeans my interface gave up and there's some deeper reality that we have to go after. So your question really\nforces out a big part of this whole approach\nthat I'm talking about. - So it's this portal to\nconscious, I wonder why you can't, your portal is not as good to a cat, to a cat's consciousness\nthan it is to a human. Does it have to do with\nthe fact that you're human and just similar organisms, organisms of similar complexity\nare able to create portals better to each other? Or is it just as you get\nmore and more complex, you get better and better portals? - Well, let me answer one aspect of it that I'm more confident about,\nthen I'll speculate on that. Why is it that the portal\nis so bad with protons, and elementary particles more generally? So quarks, leptons, and\ngluons and so forth. Well, the reason for that is because those are just symmetries of space time, more technically the\nirreducible representations of the point gray group of space time. So they're just literally representations of the data structure of\nspace time that we're using. So that's why they're\nnot very much insightful. They're just almost entirely tied to the data structure itself. There's not much, they're telling you only something\nabout the data structure, not behind the data structure. It's only when we get to higher levels that we're starting to, in some sense build portals to what's behind space time. - Sure, yeah. So there's more and more complexity built on top of the interface\nof space time with the cat. - [Donald] So you can actually\nbuild a portal, right? - Yeah, right. This interface of face\nand hair and so on, skin, there is some syncing going\non between humans though, where we sync, like you're getting a pretty good representation\nof the ideas in my head, and starting to get a foggy view of my memories in my head. Even though this is the\nfirst time we're talking, you start to project your own memories. You start to solve like a\ngiant hierarchy of puzzles about a human, 'cause we're all, there's\na lot of similarities. A lot of it rhymes. So you start to make a lot of inferences and you build up this model of a person. You have a pretty sophisticated model of what's going on underneath. Again, I just, I wonder if it's possible to construct these models about each other and nevertheless be very distant\nfrom an underlying reality. - Yes, there's a lot of work on this. So there's some interesting\nwork called signaling games where they look at how\npeople can coordinate and come to communicate. There's some interesting\nwork that was done by some colleagues and friends of mine, Louis Narins, Natalia\nCamarova, and Kimberly Jameson, where they were looking\nat evolving color words. So you have a circle of\ncolors, so the color circle. And they wanted to see if they\ncould get people to cooperate in how they carved the color\ncircle up into units of words. And so they had a game\ntheoretic kind of thing that they'd had people do. And what they found was\nthat when they included, so most people are trichromats, you have three kinds\nof cone photoreceptors, but there are some, a lot of men, 7% of men have are dichromats. They might be missing the\nred cone photoreceptor. They found that the dichromats\nhad an outsized influence on the final ways that\nthe whole space of colors was carved up and labels attached. You needed to be able to include the Dichromats in the conversation, and so they had a bigger\ninfluence on how you made the boundaries of the language. And I thought that was a really\ninteresting kind of insight that there's going to be, again, a game, perhaps a game, or evolutionary,\nor genetic algorithm kind of thing that goes on in terms of learning to communicate\nin ways that are useful. And so, yeah, you can use game theory to actually explore\nthat, or signaling games. There's a lot of brilliant work on that. I'm not doing it, but\nthere's work out there. - So if it's okay, let\nus tackle once more, and perhaps several more times after, the big topic of consciousness. This very beautiful, powerful thing that perhaps is the thing\nthat makes us human. What is it? What's the role of consciousness in, let's say even just the thing\nwe've been talking about, which is the formation of this interface? Any kind of ways you want to kind of start talking about it? - Well, let me say first what\nmost of my colleagues say. 99% are, again, assuming that\nspace time is fundamental, particles in space time,\nmatter is fundamental, and most are reductionist. And so the standard\napproach to consciousness is to figure out what\ncomplicated systems of matter with the right functional\nproperties could possibly lead to the emergence of consciousness. That's the general idea, right? So maybe you have to have neurons, maybe only if you have neurons, but that might not be enough. They have to certain kinds of complexity in their organization and their dynamics. Certain kind of network\nabilities, for example. So there are those who say for example that consciousness arises\nfrom orchestrated collapse of quantum states, of\nmicrotubules in neurons. So this is Hamrov and\nPenrose have this kind of. So it's, you start with\nsomething physical, a physical property of\nquantum states of neurons, of microtubules and neurons. And you say that somehow an\norchestrated collapse of those is consciousness or conscious experiences. Or integrated information theory. Again, you start with something physical, and if it has the right kind\nof functional properties with something they call phi, with the right kind of\nintegrated information, then you have consciousness. Or you can be a panpsychist,\nPhilip Goff for example, where you might say, well, in addition to the\nparticles in space and time, those particles are not just matter. They also could have say\na unit of consciousness. And so, but once again,\nyou're taking space and time and particles as fundamental, and you're adding a new property to them, see consciousness. And then you have to talk about how, where a proton and electron\nget together to form hydrogen, then how those consciousnesses\nmerge or interact to create the consciousness\nof hydrogen so forth. There's a tension schema\ntheory, which again, this is how neural network processes representing to the network itself its intentional processes. That could be consciousness. There's global workspace theory, and neuronal global workspace theory. So there's many, many\ntheories of this type. What's common to all\nof them is they assume that space time is fundamental. They assume that physical processes in space time is fundamental. Panpsychism adds consciousness\nas an additional thing, it's almost dualist in that regard. And my attitude is our\nbest science is telling us that space time is not fundamental. So why is that important here? Well, for centuries deep thinkers thought of earth, air, fire, and water as the fundamental elements. It was a reductionist kind of idea. Nothing was more elemental than those. And you could sort of build\neverything up from those. When we got the periodic\ntable of elements, we realized that, of course\nwe want to study earth, air, fire, and water. There's combustion science for fire. There's sciences for\nall these other things, water and so forth. So we're gonna do\nscience for these things. But fundamental, no, no, if you're looking for\nsomething fundamental, those are the wrong building blocks. Earth has many, many\ndifferent kinds of elements that project into the one\nthing that we call earth. If you don't understand\nthat there's silicon, that there's iron, that\nthere's all these different kinds of things that project\ninto what we call earth, you're hopelessly lost, you're not fundamental,\nyou're not gonna get there. And then after the periodic table, then we came up with\nquarks, leptons, and gluons, the particles of the\nstandard model of physics. And so we actually now know that if you really want\nto get fundamental, the periodic table isn't\nit, it's good for chemistry, and it's just wonderful for chemistry. But if you're trying\nto go deep fundamental, what is the fundamental science? That's not it. You're gonna have to go to\nquarks, leptons, and gluons and so forth. Well now we've discovered\nspace time itself is doomed. Quarks, leptons, and gluons are just irreducible representations of the symmetries of space time. So the whole framework on\nwhich consciousness research is being based right now is doomed. And for me, these are my\nfriends and colleagues that are doing this, they're brilliant. They're brilliant. My feeling is, I'm so\nsad that they're stuck with this old framework, because if they weren't\nstuck like with earth, air, fire, and water, you could\nactually make progress. So it doesn't matter how smart you are, if you start with earth,\nair, fire, and water, you're not gonna get anywhere, right? - Can I actually, just 'cause the word\n\"doomed\" is so interesting. Lemme give you some options. Multiple choice quiz. Is space time, we could say is reality, the way we perceive it,\ndoomed, wrong, or fake? Because doomed just means\nit could still be right and we're now ready to go deeper. - [Donald] It would be that. - So it's not wrong, it's not a complete\ndeviation from a journey toward the truth. - Right, it's like earth, air,\nfire, and water is not wrong. There is earth, air, fire, and water. That's a useful framework,\nbut it's not fundamental. - Well, there's also wrong,\nwhich is they used to believe, as I recently learned, that George Washington, the first president of the\nUnited States, was bled to death for something that could\nhave been easily treated because it was believed that you can get, actually I need to look into this further, but I guess you get\ntoxins out or demons out. I don't know what you're getting out with the bleeding of a person. But, so that ended up being wrong, but widely believed as a medical tool. So it's also possible that\nour assumption of space time is not just doomed, but it's wrong. - Well, if we believe that\nit's fundamental, that's wrong. But if we believe it's a\nuseful tool, that's right. - But bleeding somebody to death was believed to be a useful tool. - [Donald] That was wrong. - It wasn't just not fundamental, it was very, I'm sure there's cases in which bleeding somebody would work, but it would be a very tiny,\ntiny, tiny percentage of cases. So it could be that it's wrong, like it's a side road that's ultimately leading to a dead end, as opposed to a truck stop or something that you can get off of. - My feeling is not the\ndead end kind of thing. I think that what the\nphysicists are finding is that there are these\nstructures beyond space time, but they project back into space time. And so space time, when they say space time is\ndoomed, they're explicit. They're saying it's doomed in the sense that we\nthought it was fundamental. It's not fundamental. It's a useful, absolutely useful and brilliant data structure. But there are deeper data structures, like cosmological polytopes, and space time is not fundamental. What is doomed, in the\nsense that it's wrong, is reductionism, - Which is saying space time\nis fundamental, essentially. - Right, the idea that\nthat somehow being smaller in space and time, or space time, is a fundamental nature of reality. That's just wrong. It turned out to be a useful heuristic for thermodynamics and so forth and several other places. Reductionism has been very useful, but that's, in some sense, an artifact of how we use our interface. - Yeah, so you're saying\nsize doesn't matter. Okay, this is very important\nfor me to write down. Ultimately. - Ultimately, I mean it's useful for theories like thermodynamics and also for understanding brain networks in terms of individual neurons, and neurons in terms of\nchemical systems inside cells. That's all very, very useful. But the idea that we're\ngetting to the more fundamental nature of reality, no. When you get all the way\ndown in that direction, you get down to the quarks and gluons, and what you realize is\nwhat you've gotten down to is not fundamental reality, just the irreducible\nrepresentations of a data structure. That's all you've gotten down to. So you're always stuck\ninside the data structure. So you seem to be getting\ncloser and closer. I mean, I went from neural\nnetworks to neurons, neurons to chemistry,\nchemistry to particles, particles to quarks and gluons. I'm getting closer and\ncloser to the reality. No, I'm getting closer and\ncloser to the actual structure of the data structure of space and time, the irreducible representations. That's what you're getting closer to, not to a deeper understanding\nof what's beyond space time. - We'll return again to\nthis question of dynamics, because you keep saying\nthat space time is doomed, but mostly focusing on\nthe space part of that, it's very interesting to see\nwhy time gets the bad cred too. Because how do you have\ndynamics without time is the thing I'd love to talk\nto you a little bit about. But let us return your\nbrilliant whirlwind overview of the different theories of consciousness that are out there. What is consciousness if\noutside of space time? - If we think that we want to\nhave a model of consciousness, we as scientists then have to say, what do we want to write down? What kind of mathematical\nmodel are we gonna write down? And if you think about\nit, there's lots of things that you might wanna write\ndown about consciousness. Fairly complicated subject. So most of my colleagues are saying, let's start with matter or neurons and see what properties of matter could create consciousness. But I'm saying that\nthat whole thing is out, space time is doomed,\nthat whole thing is out. We need to look at\nconsciousness qua consciousness. In other words, not as\nsomething that arises in space and time, but\nperhaps it's something that creates space and\ntime as a data structure. So what do we want? And here again, there's\nno hard and fast rule, but what you as a scientist\nhave to do is to pick what you think are the minimal assumptions that are gonna allow you to\nboot up a comprehensive theory. That is the trick. So what do I want? So what what I chose to do\nwas to have three things. I said that there are\nconscious experiences, feeling of headache, the smell of garlic, experiencing the color red. Those are conscious. So that's a primitive of the theory. And the reason I want few primitives, why? Because those are the\nmiracles of the theory, right? The primitives, the\nassumptions of the theory are the things you're\nnot going to explain. Those are the things you assume. - And those experiences\nyou particularly mean there's a subjectiveness to them. - [Donald] That's right. - It's the thing when people refer to the hard problem of consciousness is it feels like something\nto look at the color red. - Exactly right. It feels like something to have a headache or to feel upset to your stomach, it feels like something. So I'm going to grant that in this theory, there are experiences and they're\nfundamental in some sense. So conscious experience. So they're not derived from physics, they're not functional\nproperties of particles. They are sui generis. They exist. Just like we assume space time exists, I'm now saying space time\nis just a data structure. It doesn't exist independent. Conscious experiences exist. - Sorry to interrupt once again, but should we be focusing in\nyour thinking on humans alone? Or is there something about, in relation to other kinds of organisms that have a sufficiently\nhigh level of complexity? Or is there some kind of generalization of the panpsychist idea that consciousness permeates all matter outside of the usual\ndefinition of what matter is inside space time? - So it's beyond human consciousness. Human consciousness from\nmy point of view would be one of a countless\nvariety of consciousness. And even within human consciousness, there's countless variety\nof consciousness within us. I mean, you have your\nleft and right hemisphere, and apparently if you\nsplit the corpus collosum, the personality of the left hemisphere, and the religious beliefs\nof the left hemisphere, can be very different\nfrom the right hemisphere. And their conscious\nexperiences can be disjointed. One could have one conscious experience. They can play 20 questions. The left hemisphere can\nhave an idea in its mind, and the right hemisphere has to guess, and it might not get it. So even within you it's more\nthan just one consciousness. It's lots of consciousnesses. So the general theory of consciousness that I'm after is not\njust human consciousness. It's going to be just consciousness, and I presume human\nconsciousness is a tiny drop in the bucket of the infinite\nvariety of consciousness. - That said, I should clarify that the black hole of\nconsciousness is the home cat. I'm pretty sure cats lack\nthe embodiment of evil and lack all capacity for\nconsciousness or compassion. So I just wanna lay that on the table, but that's a theory I'm working. I don't have any good evidence. - The black cat. - That's just a shout out\nto, sorry to distract. So that's the first assumption. - The first assumption. The second assumption is\nthat these experiences have consequences. So I'm going to say that\nconscious experiences can trigger other conscious\nexperiences somehow. So really in some sense\nthere's two basic assumptions. - So there's some kind of causality, there is a chain of causality. Does this relate to dynamics? - I'll say there's a\nprobabilistic relationship. And then, so I'm trying\nto be as non-specific to begin with and see where it leads me. So what I can write down\nare probability spaces, so probability space, which contains the conscious experiences that this consciousness can have. So I call this a conscious\nagent, this technical thing. Annaka Harris and I've talked about this, and she rightly cautions\nme that people will think that I'm bringing in a\nnotion of a self or agency and so forth when I say conscious agent. So I just wanna say that I\nuse the term conscious agent merely as a technical term. There is no notion of self\nin my fundamental definition of a conscious agent. There are only experiences and\nprobabilistic relationships of how they trigger other experiences. - So the agent is the generator\nof the conscious experience? - The agent is a mathematical structure that includes a probability\nmeasure, a probability space of possible conscious experiences, and a markovian kernel,\nwhich describes how, if this agent has certain\nconscious experiences, how that will affect the experiences of other conscious\nagents, including itself. - [Lex] But you don't\nthink of that as a self. - No, there is no notion of a self here. There's no notion of really of an agent. - But is there a locality? Is there an organism?\n- [Donald] There's no space. So these are conscious\nunits, conscious entities. - [Lex] But they're distinct in some way, 'cause they have to interact? - Well, so here's the interesting thing. When we write down the mathematics, when you have two of these\nconscious agents interacting, the pair satisfy a definition\nof a conscious agent. So they are a single conscious agent. So there is one conscious agent. But it it has a nice\nanalytic decomposition into as many conscious agents as you wish. - So that's a nice interface. - It it's a very useful\nscientific interface. It's a scale free, or if you like, a fractal-like approach to it in which we can use the\nsame unit of analysis at all scales in studying consciousness. But if I want to talk about, so there's no notion of learning, memory, problem solving,\nintelligence, self, agency. So none of that is fundamental. And the reason I did that\nwas because I want to assume as little as possible. Everything I assume is\na miracle in the theory. It's not something you explain,\nit's something you assume. So I have to build networks\nof conscious agents. If I wanna have a notion of a\nself, I have to build a self. I have to build learning,\nmemory, problem solving, intelligence and planning,\nall these different things. I have to build networks of\nconscious agents to do that. It's a trivial theorem that\nnetworks of conscious agents are computationally\nuniversal, that's trivial. So anything that we can\ndo with neural networks or automata you can do with\nnetworks of conscious agents, that's trivial. But you can also do more, the events in the probability\nspace need not be computable. So the Markovian dynamics\nis not restricted to computable functions, because the very events\nthemselves need not be computable. So this can capture any computable theory, anything we can do with neural networks, we can do with conscious agent networks. But it leaves open the\ndoor for the possibility of non-computable interactions\nbetween conscious agents. So we have to, if we\nwant a theory of memory, we have to build it. And there's lots of different\nways you could build. We've actually got a paper, Chris Fields took the lead on this, and we have a paper called\n\"Conscious Agent Networks\" where Chris takes the lead and shows how to use these\nnetworks of conscious agents to build memory and to build\nprimitive kinds of learning. - But can you provide some intuition of what conscious networks,\nnetworks of conscious agents helps you, first of all,\nwhat that looks like. And I don't just mean mathematically, of course maybe that might\nhelp build up intuition, but how that helps us potentially solve the hard problem of consciousness? Or is that baked in that that exists? Can you solve the hard\nproblem of consciousness, why it tastes delicious when\nyou eat a delicious ice cream, with networks of conscious agents? Or is that taken as an assumption? - So the standard way the\nhard problem is thought of is we're assuming space\nand time and particles, or neurons for example, these are just physical things\nthat have no consciousness. And we have to explain how\nthe conscious experience of the taste of chocolate\ncould emerge from those. So that's the typical hard\nproblem of consciousness is that problem, right? How do you boot up the taste of chocolate, the experience or the taste of\nchocolate from neurons, say, or the right kind of artificial\nintelligence circuitry? How do you boot that up? That's typically what the\nhard problem of consciousness means to researchers. Notice that I'm changing the problem. I'm not trying to boot\nup conscious experiences from the dynamics of neurons or silicon or something like that. I'm saying that that's the wrong problem. My hard problem would go\nin the other direction. If I start with conscious experiences, how do I build up space and time? How do I build up what I\ncall the physical world? How do I build up what we call brains? Because I'm saying\nconsciousness is not something that brains do. Brains are something that\nconsciousness makes up. It is among the experience, it's an ephemeral\nexperience in consciousness. I look inside, so to be\nvery, very clear right now, I have no neurons. If you looked, you would see neurons. That's a data structure that\nyou would create on the fly. And it's a very useful one. As soon as you look away, you garbage collect that data structure. Just like that Necker cube\nthat I was talking about on the piece of paper, when you look, you see a 3D\ncube, you create it on the fly. As soon as you look away, that's gone. - [Lex] When you say you, you\nmean a human being scientist. - Right now, that's right. More generally it'll be conscious agents, because as you pointed out, am I asking for a theory of\nconscience only about humans? No, it's consciousness, which human consciousness\nis just a tiny sliver. - So, but you are saying that there is, that's a useful data structure. How many other data structures are there? That's why I said you, human. If there's another earth, if there's another alien civilization doing these kinds of investigations, would they come up with\nsimilar data structures? - [Donald] Probably not. - What is the space of data structures, I guess is what I'm asking. - My guess is that if\nconsciousness is fundamental, if consciousness is all there is, then the only thing that\nmathematical structure can be about is possibilities\nof consciousness. And that suggests to\nme that there could be an infinite variety of consciousnesses and a vanishingly small fraction of them use space time data structures and the kinds of structures that we use. There's an infinite\nvariety of data structures. Now this is very similar to something that Max Tegmark has said,\nbut I wanna distinguish it. He has his level four multiverse idea. He thinks that mathematics is fundamental. And so that's the fundamental reality, and since there's an infinite variety, endless variety of\nmathematical structures, there's an infinite variety\nof multiverses in his view. I'm saying something similar in spirit, but importantly different. There's an infinite variety\nof mathematical structures. Absolutely. But mathematics isn't\nthe fundamental reality in this framework, consciousness is. And mathematics is to consciousness like bones are to an\norganism, you need the bones. So mathematics is not\ndivorced from consciousness, but it's not the entirety of\nconsciousness by any means. And so there's an infinite\nvariety of consciousnesses and signaling games that\nconsciousnesses could interact via and therefore worlds, common worlds, data structures that they\ncan use to communicate. So space and time is just\none of an infinite variety. And so I think that\nwhat we'll find is that as we go outside of our\nlittle space time bubble, we will encounter utterly alien forms of conscious experience that we may not be able\nto really comprehend in the following sense. If I ask you to imagine a color that you've never seen\nbefore, does anything happen? Nothing happens, right? - [Lex] Yeah, no. - Nothing happens. And that's just one color, I'm asking for just one color. We actually know, by the way, that there apparently there\nare women called Tetrafems who have four color\nreceptors, not just three. And Kimberly Jameson and\nothers who studied these women have good evidence that\nthey apparently have a new dimension of color experience that the rest of us don't have. So these women are apparently\nliving in a world of color that you and I can't\neven concretely imagine. No man can imagine them. And yet they're real color experiences. And so in that sense, I'm saying, now take that little baby step. Oh, there are women who\nhave color experiences that I could never have. Whoa, that's shocking. Now take that infinite, there are consciousness where every aspect of their experiences\nis like that new color. It's something utterly alien to you. You have nothing like that. And yet these are all possible varieties of conscious experience. - When you say there's\na lot of consciousness, is a singular consciousness\nbasically the set of possible experiences you can\nhave in that subjective way? As opposed to the underlying mechanism. Because you say that having\na extra color receptor, ability to have new experiences, that's somehow a different consciousness. Is there a way to see that as\nall the same consciousness, the subjectivity itself? - Right, because when we have two of these conscious agents\ninteracting, mathematics, they actually satisfy the\ndefinition of a conscious agent. So in fact, they are a\nsingle conscious agent. So in fact, one way to\nthink about what I'm saying, I'm postulating with my colleagues, Jayton and Chris and others,\nRobert Brentner and so forth. There is one big conscious\nagent, infinitely complicated. But fortunately we can,\nfor analytic purposes, break it down all the\nway to, in some sense, the simplest conscious agent, which has one conscious experience, one. This one agent can experience red 35. That's it. That's what it experiences. You can get all the way down to that. - So you think it's\npossible that consciousness, whatever that is, is fundamental, or at least much more in the\ndirection of the fundamental than is space time as we perceive it. - That's the proposal. And therefore what I have to do in terms of the hard\nproblem of consciousness is to show how dynamical\nsystems of conscious agents could lead to what we call\nspace, and time, and neurons, and brain activity. In other words, we have to\nshow how you get space time and physical objects\nentirely from a theory of conscious agents outside of space time with the dynamics outside of space time. And I can tell you how we plan to do that. But that's the idea. - The magic of it, that\nchocolate is delicious. So there's a mathematical kind of thing that we could say here, how it\ncan emerge within the system of networks of conscience agents. But is there going to be,\nat the end of the proof, why chocolate is so delicious? Or no, I guess I'm going to ask different kinds of dumb\nquestions to try to sneak up. - Sure, oh, well that's\nthe right question. And when I say that I\ntook conscious experiences as fundamental, what that means is, in the current version of my theory, I'm not explaining conscious experiences where they came from. That's the miracle. That's one of the miracles. So I have two miracles in my theory. There are conscious experiences, like the taste of chocolate, and that there's a\nprobabilistic relationship. When certain conscious experiences occur, others are more likely to occur. Those are the two miracles that. - It's possible to get beyond that and somehow start to chip\naway at the miracle-ness of that miracle that\nchocolate is still delicious. - I hope so. I've got my hands full with\nwhat I'm doing right now. But I can just say a top level how I would think about that. That would get at this, consciousness without form. This is gonna be really,\nthis is really tough, because it's consciousness without form versus the various forms\nthat consciousness takes for the experiences that it has. - [Lex] Right, right. - So when I write down a probability space for these conscious experiences, I say, here's a probability space for the possible conscious\nexperiences, right? It's just like when I write\ndown a probability space for an experiment, like I'm\ngonna flip a coin twice, right? And I want to look at the\nprobability of various outcomes. So I have to write down\na probability space. There could be heads heads, heads tails, tails heads, tails tails. So before, as any class in\nprobability you're told, write down your probability space. If you don't write down\nyour probability space, you can't get started. So here's my probability\nspace for consciousness. How do I wanna interpret that structure? The structure is just sitting there, there's gonna be a dynamics\nthat happens on it. Experiences appear and then disappear, just like heads appears and disappears. So one way to think about that\nfundamental probability space is that corresponds to\nconsciousness without any content. The infinite consciousness that transcends any particular content. - Well, do you think of that\nas a mechanism, as a thing? Like the rules that govern\nthe dynamics of the thing outside of space time, isn't that, if you think conscious is fundamental, isn't that essentially getting like, it is solving the hard\nproblem, which is like from where does this thing pop up, which is the mechanism\nof the thing popping up. Whatever the consciousness is, the different kinds and\nso on, that mechanism. And also, the question I wanna ask is how tricky do you think\nit is to solve that problem? You solved a lot of difficult problems throughout the history of humanity. There's probably more\nproblems to solve left than we've solved by like an infinity. But along that long journey\nof intelligent species, when will we solve this consciousness? Which is one way to measure\nthe difficulty of the problem. - So I'll give two answers. There's one problem I think we can solve but we haven't solved yet. And that is the reverse\nof what my colleagues call the hard problem. The problem of how do you start\nwith conscious experiences, in the way that I've just\ndescribed them and the dynamics, and build up space and time and brains? That I think is a tough technical problem, but it's in principle solvable. So I think we can solve that. So we would solve the hard problem, not by showing how brains\ncreate consciousness, but how networks of conscious agents create what we call the\nsymbols that we call brains. So that, I think. - But does that allow you\nto, so that's interesting. That's an interesting idea. Consciousness creates the brain, not the brain creates consciousness, but does that allow\nyou to build the thing? - My guess is that it will\nenable unbelievable technologies, and I'll tell you why. I think it plugs into the work that the physicists are doing. So this theory of consciousness\nwill be even deeper than the structures that\nthe physicists are finding, like the amplituhedron. But the other answer to your\nquestion is less positive. As I said earlier, I think\nthat there is no such thing as a theory of everything. So that I think that the theory\nthat my team is working on, this conscious agent theory\nis just a 1.0 theory. We're using probability\nspaces and markovian kernels. I can easily see people now saying, well, we can do better if we\ngo to category theory, and we can get a deeper,\nperhaps more interesting. And then someone will say, well now I'll go to topoid theory, and so I imagine that\nthere'll be conscious agents, 5, 10, 3 trillion point 0, but I think it will never end. I think ultimately this question that we sort of put our fingers on of, how does the formless give birth to form? To the taste, the wonderful\ntaste of chocolate? I think that we will always\ngo deeper and deeper, but we will never solve that. That in some sense, that\nwill be a primitive. I hope I'm wrong. Maybe it's just the limits\nof my current imagination. So I'll just say, my imagination right now doesn't peer that deep. So I don't, by the way I'm saying this, I don't want to discourage\nsome brilliant 20-year-old who then later on proves me dead wrong. I hope to be proven dead wrong. - Well, just like you\nsaid, a century from now, everything we're saying now,\neverything you're saying, all your theories will be laughing stock. They will respect the\npuzzle solving abilities and how much we're able\nto do with so little. But outside of that it will all be just, the silliness will be\nentertainment for a teenager. - Especially the silliness when we thought that we were\nso smart and we knew it all. - So it would be interesting\nto explore your ideas by contrasting, you\nmentioned Annaka Harris, you mentioned Philip Goff. So outside of, if you're\nnot allowed to say the fundamental disagreement is the fact that space\ntime is fundamental, what are interesting distinctions between ideas of consciousness, between you and Annaka for example? You guys have been on a podcast together. I'm sure in private you guys have some incredible conversations. So where are some\ninteresting sticking points, some interesting disagreements, let's say, with with Annaka first? Maybe there'll be a few other people. - Well, Annaka and I just had\na conversation this morning where we were talking about our ideas, and what we discovered\nreally in our conversation was that we're pretty\nmuch on the same page. It was really just terminology\nabout consciousness. Yeah, our ideas about consciousness are pretty much on the same page. She rightly has cautioned me to, when I talk about conscious agents, to point out that the notion of agency is not fundamental in my theory, the notion of self is not fundamental. And that's absolutely true. I can use this network\nof conscious agents, and I now use as a technical term. Conscious agents is a technical term for that probability space\nwith the Markovian dynamics. I can use that to build models of a self and to build models of agency. But they're not fundamental. So she has really been very helpful in helping me to be a little\nbit clear about these ideas and not say things that are misleading. - The word, I mean, this\nis the interesting thing about language actually, is that language, quite obviously, is an interface to truth. It's so fascinating that individual words can have so much ambiguity, and that the specific choices of a word within a particular sentence, within the context of a sentence, can have such a difference in meaning. It's quite fascinating, especially when you're talking about topics like consciousness, because it's a very loaded term. It means a lot of things\nto a lot of people. And the entire concept\nis shrouded a mystery. So combination of the fact\nthat it's a loaded term and that there's a lot of mystery, people can just interpret\nit in all kinds of ways. And so you have to be both precise and help them avoid getting stuck on some kind of side\nroad of miscommunication, lost in translation because\nyou used the wrong word. That's interesting. I mean, because for a lot of people, consciousness is ultimately\nconnected to self. I mean, our experience\nof consciousness is very, it's connected to this ego. I mean, I just, I mean, what\nelse could it possibly be? How do you begin to\ncomprehend, to visualize, to conceptualize a consciousness that's not connected to like\nthis particular organism? - Well, I have a way of thinking about this whole problem now that comes outta this\nframework that's different. So we can imagine a\ndynamics of consciousness, not in space and time, just abstractly. It could be cooperative for all we know. It could be very friendly, I don't know. And you can set up a\ndynamics, a Markovian dynamics that is so-called stationary, and that's a technical term, which means that the entropy\neffectively is not increasing. There is some entropy, but it's constant. So there's no increasing entropy. And in that sense, the\ndynamics is timeless. There is no entropic time. But it's a trivial theorem. Three line proof that if you have a stationary Markovian dynamics, any projection that you\nmake of that dynamics, by conditional probability. And if you want, I can state even more mathematically precisely for some readers or listeners. But if any projection you take\nby conditional probability, the induced image of that markov chain will have increasing entropy. You'll have entropic time. So I'll be very, very precise. I have a markov chain X1, X2, through XN, where N goes to infinity. The entropy H, capital H, of XN is equal to the entropy\nH of XN-1 for all N. So the entropy is the same, but it's a theorem that H\nof XN, say given X sub one, is greater than or equal\nto H of XN-1 given X1. - [Lex] Sure, where does\nthe greater come from? - Because, well the theorem,\nthe three line proof, H of XN given X1 is greater than or equal to H of XN given X1 and X2. Because conditioning reduces. But then H of XN minus one given X1, X2 is equal to H of XN-1 given X2, by the markov property. And then because it's stationary, it's equal to H of X. I have to write it down. - [Lex] Yeah, sure, sure. - I have to write it, anyway,\nthere's a three line proof. - But the assumption of stationarity, we're using a lot of terms\nthat people won't understand. Doesn't matter. So there's some kind of,\nso Markovian dynamics is basically trying to\nmodel some kind of system with some probabilities,\nand there's agents, and they interact in some kind of way, and you can say something\nabout that system as it evolves. So stationary system is one\nthat has certain properties in terms of entropy. Very well, but we don't know if\nit's stationary or not. We don't know what the properties, so you have to kind of take assumptions and see, okay, well what\ndoes the systems behave like under these different properties? The more constraints, the\nmore assumptions you take, the more predictive, the more interesting, powerful things you can say. But sometimes they're limiting. That said, we're talking\nabout consciousness here. How does that, you said\ncooperative, okay, competitive. I like chocolate. I'm sitting here, I have a\nbrain, I'm wearing a suit. It sure as hell feels like I'm myself. What, am I tuning in? Am I plugging into something? Am I a projection, a simple trivial\nprojection into space time from some much larger organism that I can't possibly comprehend? How the hell? You're saying, you're building\nup mathematical intuitions. Fine, great. But I'm just, I'm having\nan existential crisis here, and I'm gonna die soon. We'll all die pretty quickly. So I wanna figure out why\nchocolate's so delicious. So help me out here. So let's just keep sneaking up to this. - Right, so the whole technical thing was to say this, even if the\ndynamics of consciousness is stationary, so that\nthere is no entropic time. Any projection of it, any view of it will have the artifact of entropic time. That's a limited resource. Limited resources, so that\nthe fundamental dynamics may have no limits, limited\nresources whatsoever. Any projection will have certainly time as a limited resource, and probably lots of\nother limited resources. Hence, we could get\ncompetition, and evolution, and nature red in tooth and claw as an artifact of a deeper system in which those aren't fundamental. And in fact, I take it as\nsomething that this theory must do at some point, is to show how\nnetworks of conscious agents, even if they're not resource limited, give rise to evolution\nby natural selection via a projection. - Yeah, but you're saying,\nI'm trying to understand how the limited resources\nthat give rise to, so first the thing gives rise to time, that gives rise to the limited resource, that gives rise to evolution\nby natural selection. How that has to do with the fact that chocolate is delicious. - Well, it is not gonna do that directly. It's gonna get to this notion of self. - Oh, it's gonna give you. - [Donald] The notion of self. - Oh, the evolution gives\nyou the notion of self. - And also of a self\nseparate from other selves. So the idea would be. - Has a competition, has life and death and all those kinds of things - That's right. So it won't, I don't think, as I said, I don't think that I can tell you how the formless gives rise to\nthe experience of chocolate. Right now my current theory says that's one of the miracles I'm assuming. So my theory can't do it. And the reason my theory can't do it is because Hoffman's brain\ncan't do it right now. But the notion of self, yes. The notion of self can be an\nartifact of the projection. So there's one conscious agent. Because anytime conscious agents interact, they form a new conscious agent. So there's one conscious agent. Any projection of that one conscious agent gives rise to time, even\nif there wasn't any time in that one conscious agent. And it gives rise, I want to,\nnow, I haven't proven this, so now this is me guessing\nwhere the theory's gonna go. I haven't done this, there's\nno paper on this yet. So now I'm speculating. My guess is I'll be able to show, or my brighter colleagues working with me will be able to show, that we will get evolution\nof a natural selection, the notion of individual selves, individual physical objects and so forth, coming out as a projection of this thing. And that the self, this then\nwill be really interesting in terms of how it starts to interact with certain spiritual traditions, right? Where they will say that\nthere is a notion of self that needs to be let go,\nwhich is this finite self that's competing with other\nselves to get more money and prestige and so forth. That self in some sense has to die. But there's a deeper self,\nwhich is the timeless being that precedes, not precludes, but precedes any particular conscious experiences. The ground of all experience. That there's that notion\nof a deep capital self. But our little Lowercase S selves could be artifacts of projection. And it may be that what\nconsciousness is doing in this framework is it's\nprojected itself down into a self that calls itself Don and a self that calls itself Lex. And through conversations like this, it's trying to find out about itself, and eventually transcend the\nlimits of the Don and Lex little icons that it's using. And that little projection of itself, through this conversation, is somehow, it's learning about itself. - So that thing dressed me up today in order to understand itself. - And in some sense, you\nand I are not separate from that thing, and we're\nnot separate from each other. - Yeah, well, I have to\nquestion the fashion choices on my end then. All right, so you mentioned you agree in terms of consciousness, on\na lot of things with Annaka. Is there somebody, friend or friendly foe, that you disagree with in\nsome nuanced, interesting way, or some major way about consciousness, about these topics of reality\nthat you return to often? It's like Christopher Hitchens with the Rabbi David Wallby have had interesting\nconversations through years that added to the complexity and the beauty of their friendship. Is there somebody like that, that over the years has been a source of disagreement with you that strengthened your ideas? - Hmm, my ideas have been\nreally shaped by several things. One is the physicalist framework that my scientific colleagues, almost to a person have\nadopted, and that I adopted too. The reason I walked away from\nit was because it became clear that we couldn't start with\nunconscious ingredients and boot up consciousness. - Can you define physicalist in contrast to reductionist. - So a physicalist, I would say, is someone who takes space time and the objects within space time as ontologically fundamental. - Right, and then reductionist\nis saying the smaller, the more fundamental. - That's a methodological thing. That's saying within space time, as you go to smaller and\nsmaller scales in space, you get deeper and deeper laws, more and more fundamental laws. And the reduction of\ntemperature to particle movement was an example of that. But I think that that\nthe reason that worked was almost an artifact of\nthe nature of our interface. - That was for a long time, your colleagues including\nyourself, were physicalist, and now you broke away. - Broke away because I\nthink you can't start with unconscious ingredients\nand boot up consciousness. - So even with Roger Penrose, where there's like a gray area. - Right, and here's the\nchallenge I would put to all of my friends\nand colleagues who are, give one specific conscious experience that you can boot up, right? So if you think that it's\nintegrated information, and I've asked this of\nGiulio Tononi a couple times, back in the nineties, and\nthen just a couple years ago. Asked Giulio, okay, so great\nintegrated information. So we're all interested in explaining some specific conscious experiences. So pick one, the taste of chocolate. What is the integrated\ninformation, precise structure that we need for chocolate? And why does that structure\nhave to be for chocolate? And why is it that it could\nnot possibly be vanilla? Is there any, I asked them, is there any one specific\nconscious experience that you can account for? Because notice they've\nset themselves the task of booting up conscious\nexperiences from physical systems. That's the task they've set themselves. - But that doesn't mean they're, I understand your intuition, but that doesn't mean they're wrong just because they can't find\na way to boot it up yet. - That's right. No, that doesn't mean that they're wrong. It just just means that\nthey haven't done it. I think it's principled. The reason is principled, but I'm happy that they're exploring it. But the fact is, the remarkable fact is there's not one theory. So integrated information theory, orchestrated collapse of microtubules, global workspace theory. - These are all theories of consciousness. - [Lex] These are all\ntheories of consciousness. There's not a single theory that can give you a specific\nconscious experience that they say, here is\nthe physical dynamics or the physical structure. That must be the taste of chocolate or whatever one they want. - So you're saying it's impossible. They're saying it is just hard. - Yeah, I mean my attitude is, okay, no one said you had to start with neurons or physical systems and\nboot up consciousness. - [Lex] You guys are just taking that. - You chose that problem. So since you chose that problem, how much progress have you made? Well, when you've not been able to come up with a single specific\nconscious experience, and you've had these\nbrilliant people working on it for decades now, that's\nnot really good progress. - Let me ask you to play devil's advocate, can you try to steel\nman, steel man meaning argue the best possible case for reality, the opposite of your book title? Or maybe just sticking to consciousness, can you take the physicalist view? Can you steel man the physicalist view for a brief moment\nplaying devil's advocate, or steel man the person you used to be? So a physicalist. What's a good, like saying that you might be wrong right now, what would be a convincing\nargument for that? - Well, I think the argument I would give and that I believed was, look, when you have very simple physical systems like a piece of dirt,\nthere's not much evidence of life or consciousness. It's only when you get really\ncomplicated physical systems like that have brains. And really, the more\ncomplicated the brains, the more it looks like\nthere's consciousness and the more complicated\nthat consciousness is. Surely that means that\nsimple physical systems don't create much consciousness,\nor if maybe not any. Or maybe if panpsychists, they create the most elementary kinds of simple conscious experiences, but you need more\ncomplicated physical systems to boot up to create more\ncomplicated consciousnesses. I think that's the intuition that drives most of my colleagues. - And you're saying that\nthis concept of complexity is ill-defined when you\nground it to space time? - Oh, well, I think it's well defined within the framework of space time, right? - No, it's ill defined\nrelative to what you need to actually understand consciousness, because you're grounding\ncomplexity just in space time. - Oh, got you. Right, right. Yeah, what what I'm saying is, if it were true that space\ntime was fundamental, then I would have to agree that if there is such a\nthing as consciousness, given the data that we've got that complex brains have consciousness and dirt doesn't, that\nsomehow it's the complexity of the dynamics or organization, the function of the physical system that somehow is creating\nthe consciousness. So under those assumptions, yes, but when the physicists\nthemselves are telling us that space time is not\nfundamental, then I can understand, see then the whole picture\nstarts to come into focus. My colleagues are brilliant, right? These are really smart people. I mean, Francis Crick worked on this for the last 20 years of his life. I mean, these are not stupid people. These are brilliant, brilliant people. The fact that we've come up with not a single specific\nconscious experience that we can explain, and no hope. There's no one that says, I'm close, I'll have it for you in a year. No, there's just like\nthis fundamental gap. So much so that Steve Pinker\nin one of his writings says, look, he likes the\nglobal workspace theory, but he says the last dollop of the theory in which there's something it's like, we may have to just stipulate\nthat as a brute fact. And Pinker is brilliant, right? He understands the state\nof play on this problem, the hard problem of consciousness, starting with physicalist assumptions and then trying to boot up consciousness. You've set yourself the problem. I'm starting with physical\nstuff that's not conscious. I'm trying to get the\ntaste of chocolate out as maybe some kind of function\nof the dynamics of that. We've not been able to do that. And so Pinker is saying\nwe may have to punt, we may have to just\nstipulate that last bit, he calls it the last dollop, and just stipulate it\nas a bare fact of nature that there is something that's like, well, from my point of view is the physical, the whole point, the whole\npromise of the physicalist was we wouldn't have to stipulate. I was gonna start with the physical stuff and explain where the\nconsciousness came from. If I'm gonna stipulate consciousness, why don't I just stipulate consciousness and not stipulate all\nthe physical stuff too? So I'm stipulating less. I'm saying, okay, I agree. - [Lex] Which is the panpsychist\nperspective, I suppose. - Well, it's actually what I call the conscious realist perspective. - [Lex] Conscious realist. - Panpsychists are\neffectively dualists, right? They're saying there's physical stuff that really is fundamental\nand then consciousness stuff. So I would go with Pinker and say, look, let's just stipulate\nthe consciousness stuff, but I'm not gonna stipulate\nthe physical stuff. I'm gonna actually now show how to boot up the physical stuff from just\nthe consciousness stuff. So I'll stipulate less. - Is it possible? So if you stipulate less, is it possible for our limited brains\nto visualize reality as we delve deeper and deeper and deeper? Is it possible to visualize\nsomehow, with the tools of math, with the tools of computers,\nwith the tools of our mind? Are we hopelessly lost? You said there's ways to intuit what's true using\nmathematics and probability and sort of Markovian dynamics,\nall that kind of stuff. But that's not visualizing, that's kind of building intuition. But is it possible to visualize\nin the way we visualize so nicely in space time,\nin four dimensions, in three dimensions, sorry. Well, two. We really are looking through\na two dimensional screen until it's what we intuit to\nbe a three dimensional world. And also inferring dynamic\nstuff, making it 4D. Anyway, is it possible to\nvisualize some pretty pictures that give us a deeper sense\nof the truth of reality? - I think that we will\nincrementally be able to do that. I think that, for example,\nthe picture that we have of electrons and photons\ninteracting and scattering wasn't, it may have not been possible until Faraday did all of his experiments, and then Maxwell wrote down his equations, and we were then sort of\nforced by his equations to think in a new way. And then when Plunk in 1900, desperate to try to solve the problem of black body radiation, what they call the\nultraviolet catastrophe, where Newton was predicting\ninfinite energies where there weren't infinite energies in black body radiation. And he, in desperation,\nproposed packets of energy. Then once you've done that, and then you have a Einstein\ncome along five years later and show how that explains\nthe photo electric effect. And then, eventually in\n1926 you get quantum theory, and then you get this whole\nnew way of thinking that was, from the Newtonian point of view, completely contradictory and\ncounterintuitive certainly. And maybe if Dyson is\nright, not contradictory, maybe if you use intuitionist math, they're not contradictory, but still certainly you wouldn't have gone there. And so here's a case where the experiments and then a desperate mathematical move, sort of we use those as a\nflashlight into the deep fog. And so that science may be the\nflashlight into the deep fog. - I wonder if it's still\npossible to visualize, like we talk about consciousness from a self perspective experience, hold that idea in our mind, the way you can experience\nthings directly. We've evolved to experience\nthings in this 3D world, and that's a very rich experience. When you're thinking mathematically, you still in the end of the\nday have to project it down to a low dimensional\nspace to make conclusions. Your conclusions will\nbe a number, or a line, or a plot, or a visual. So I wonder like how we can really touch some deep truth in a subjective way, like experience it, really\nfeel the beauty of it in the way that humans feel beauty. Are we screwed? - I don't think we're screwed. I think that we get little hints of it, from psychedelic drugs and so forth. We get hints that there\nare certain interventions that we can take on our interface. I apply this chemical, which is just some element of\nmy interface to this other, to a brain by ingesting it. And all of a sudden I seem\nlike I've opened new portals into conscious experiences. Well, that's very, very suggestive. That's like the black body\nradiation doing something that we didn't expect, right? It doesn't go to infinity when we thought it was\ngonna go to infinity and we're forced to propose these quanta. So once we have a theory\nof conscious agents, and its projection into\nspace time, I should say, I should sketch what I\nthink that projection is. But then I think we can then start to ask specific questions. When you're taking DMT,\nor you're taking LSD, or something like that, now\nthat we have this deep model, we've reverse engineered space and time and physical particles,\nwe've pulled them back to this theory of conscious agents. Now we can ask ourselves,\nin this idealized future, what are we doing to conscious agents when we apply 5-MeO-DMT,\nwhat are we doing? Are we opening a new portal? So when I say that, I mean, I have a portal into consciousness that I call my body of Lex\nFridman that I'm creating. And it's a genuine portal, not perfect, but it's a genuine portal. I'm definitely communicating\nwith your consciousness. And we know that we have one technology for building new portals. We know one technology,\nand that is having kids. Having kids is how we build\nnew portals into consciousness. It takes a long time. - Can you elaborate that? Oh, oh, oh, you mean like. - Your son and your daughter didn't exist. That was a portal. You're having contact with consciousness that you never would have had before, but now you've got a son or a daughter. You went through this physical process, they were born, there was all that. - Is that portal yours? So when you have kids, are\nyou creating new portals that are completely\ndistinct from the portals that you've created with\nother consciousness? Like can you elaborate on that? To which degree are the\nconsciousness of your kids a part of you? - Well, so every person that\nI see, that symbol that I see, the body that I see,\nis a portal potentially for me to interact with a consciousness. - [Lex] Yeah. - And each consciousness\nhas unique character. We call it a personality and so forth. So with each new kid that's born, we come in contact with a personality that we've never seen before, and a version of consciousness that we've never seen\nbefore at a deeper level. The theory says there's one agent. So this is a different\nprojection of that one agent. But, so that's what I mean by a portal is, within my own interface,\nmy own projection, can I see other projections\nof that one consciousness. So can I get portals in that sense? And I think we will get a theory of that, that we will get a theory of portals, and then we can ask how the\npsychedelics are acting. Are they actually creating\nnew portals or not? If they're not, we should\nnevertheless then understand how we could create a new portal. Maybe we have to just study what happens when we have kids. We know that that technology\ncreates new portals. So we have to reverse engineer that and then say, okay, could we somehow create new portals de novo with that? - With something like\nbrain computer interfaces, for example. - Yeah, maybe just a chemical\nor something like that more complicated than a chemical. That's why I think that the psychedelics, the psychedelics may,\nbecause they might be affecting this portal in certain ways that it turns it around and opens up. In other words, maybe once we understand this thing is a portal,\nyour body as a portal, and understand all of its complexities, maybe we'll realize that\nthat portal can be shifted to different parts of\nthe deeper consciousness and give new windows on it. And so in that way, maybe yes, psychedelics could open up new portals in the sense that they're taking something that's already a complex portal\nand just tweaking it a bit. - Well, but creating is a\nvery powerful difference between morphing. - [Donald] Tweaking versus\nthe creating, I agree. - But maybe it gives you intuition to at least the full space\nof the kinds of things that this particular system is capable of. I mean, the idea, your idea that the consciousness creates brains. I mean, that breaks my brain, because I guess I'm still a\nphysicalist in that sense, because it is just much\neasier to intuit the world. It's very practical to think, all right, there's a neural network, and what are the different ways, fascinating capabilities can emerge from this neural network? - [Donald] I agree, it's easier. - And so you start to present\nto yourself the problem of, okay, well how does consciousness arise? How does intelligence arise? How does emotion arise? How does memory arise, how do we filter within this system all the incoming sensory information we're able to allocate attention in different interesting ways? How do all those mechanisms arise? To say that there's\nother fundamental things we don't understand outside of space time that are actually core to\nhow this whole thing works is a bit paralyzing. Because it's like, oh, we're not 10% done. We're like 0.001% done. Is the immediate feeling. - I certainly understand that. My attitude about it is, if you\nlook at the young physicists who are searching for these\nstructures beyond space time, like amplituhedron and so forth, they're having a ball. Space time, that's what the old folks did. That's what the older generation did. We're doing something that\nreally is fun and new, and they're having a blast, and they're finding all\nthese new structures. So I think that we're going to succeed in getting a new deeper theory. I can just say what I'm hoping with the theory that I'm working on. I'm hoping to show that I could have this timeless dynamics of consciousness. No entropic time. I take a projection and I show how this timeless dynamics\nlooks like the big bang and the entire evolution of space time. In other words, I see how my\nwhole space time interface. - So not just, the projections doesn't just look like space time. You can explain with it the whole from the origin of the universe. - That's what we have to do. And that's what the physicists understand. When they go beyond space\ntime to the amplituhedron and the cosmological polytope, they ultimately know that\nthey have to get back the big bang story and\nthe whole evolution, that whole story where\nthere were no living things, there was just a point. And then the explosion, and then just particles at high energy, and then eventually the cooling down and the differentiation, and\nfinally matter condenses, and then life, and then consciousness. That whole story has to\ncome out of something that's deeper and without time. And that's what we're up to. We want to get that. So the whole story that\nwe've been telling ourselves about big bang and how brains\nevolve into consciousness will come out of a much deeper theory. And for someone like me, it's a lot. I mean, but for the younger generation, this is like, oh wow, all the\nlow cherries aren't picked. This is really good stuff. This is really new fundamental\nstuff that we can do. So I can't wait to read the papers of the younger generation,\nand I wanna see them. - Kids these days with their\nnon-space time assumptions. It's just interesting looking\nat the philosophical tradition of this difficult ideas you struggle with. If you look like somebody\nlike Emmanuel Kant, what are some interesting\nagreements and disagreements you have with the guy about\nthe nature of reality? - So there's a lot in agreement, right? So Kant was an idealist,\ntranscendental idealist, and he basically had the\nidea that we don't see nature as it is. We impose a structure on nature. And so in some sense, I'm\nsaying something similar. I'm saying that, by the way, I don't call myself an idealist. I call myself a conscious realist, because idealism has a long history. A lot of different ideas\ncome under idealism, and there's a lot of debates and so forth. It tends to be identified with, in many cases, anti-science\nand anti-realism And I don't want either\nconnection with my ideas. And so I just called\nmine conscious realism, with an emphasis on realism,\nand not anti-realism. But one place where I would\nof course disagree with Kant was that he thought that\nEuclidean space time was a priori. We just know that that's false. So he went too far on that. But in general, the\nidea that we don't start with space time, that space\nand time is in some sense the forms of our perceptions. Yes, absolutely. And I would say that\nthere's a lot in common with Barkley in that regard. There's a lot of ingenious\narguments in Barkley. Leibniz, in his monodology, understood very clearly\nthat the hard problem was not solvable. He posed a hard problem\nand basically dismissed it and just said, you can't do this. And so if he came here\nand saw where we are, he'd say, look guys, I told\nyou this 300 years ago, and he had his monodology. He was trying to do something like this, it's different from what I'm doing. But he had these things that\nwere not in space and time, these monads. He was trying to build something. I'm trying to build a\ntheory of conscious agents. My guess is that if he\ncame here, I could just, if he saw what I was doing, he would say, he would understand it and\nimmediately take off with it and go places that I couldn't. He would have no problems. - So there would be, right,\nthere would be overlap of the spirit of the ideas, would be totally overlapping. - But his genius would\nthen just run with it far faster than I could. - I love the humility here. So let me ask you about sort\nof practical implications of your ideas to our world,\nour complicated world. When you look at the big\nquestions of humanity, of hate, war, what else is there, evil? Maybe there's the\npositive aspects of that, of meaning, of love. What is the fact that reality\nis an illusion perceived? What is the conscious realism? When applied to daily life, what kind of impact does it have? - A lot, and it's sort of scary. We all know that life is ephemeral, and spiritual traditions have said, wake up to the fact that\nanything that you do here is gonna disappear. But it's even more ephemeral\nthan perhaps we have thought. I see this bottle because\nI create it right now. As soon as I look away, that data structure has\nbeen garbage collected. That bottle, I have to\nrecreate it every time I look. So I spend all my money and\nI buy this fancy car that, that car, I have to keep recreating it every time I look at\nit, it's that ephemeral. So all the things that\nwe invest ourselves in, we fight over, and we\nkill each other over, and we have wars over. These are all, it's just like people in a virtual reality simulation, and there's this Porsche, and we all see the Porsche. Well, that Porsche\nexists when I look at it, I turn my headset and I look at it, and then if Joe turns his\nheadset in the right way, he'll see his Porsche. But it's not even the\nsame Porsche that I see. He's creating his own Porsche. So these things are exceedingly ephemeral. And now just imagine saying\nthat that's my Porsche. Well, you can agree to say\nthat it's your Porsche, but really the Porsche only\nexists as long as you look. So this, all of a sudden, what the spiritual\ntraditions have been saying for a long, long time,\nthis gets cashed out in mathematically precise science. It's saying ephemeral, yes, in fact, it lasts for a few milliseconds, a few hundred milliseconds\nwhile you look at it, and then it's gone. So the whole idea, why are\nwe fighting, why do we hate? We fight over possessions because we think that we're small little objects inside this preexisting space time. We assume that that mansion and that car exists independent of us and that somehow these little things can\nhave our sense of self and importance enhanced by\nhaving that special car, or that special house,\nor that special person, when in fact it's just the opposite. You create that mansion\nevery time you look. You're something far\ndeeper than that mansion. You're the entity which can\ncreate that mansion on the fly. And there's nothing there. There's nothing to the mansion except what you create in this moment. So all of a sudden, when\nyou take this point of view, it has all sorts of implications for how we interact with each other, how we treat each other. And again, a lot of things that spiritual traditions\nhave said, it's a mixed bag. Spiritual traditions are a mixed bag. So lemme just be right\nup front about that. I'm not promoting any particular, but they do have some insights. - They have wisdom. - They have certain wisdom. I can point to nonsense. I won't go into it, but I can also point to lots of nonsense. So the issue is to then to\nlook for the key insights. And I think they have a lot of insights about the ephemeral nature\nof objects in space and time and not being attached to\nthem, including our own bodies, and reversing that I'm\nnot this little thing, a little consciousness\ntrapped in the body, and the consciousness itself\nis only a product of the body. So when the body dies, the\nconsciousness disappears. It turns completely around. The consciousness is fundamental. The body, my hand exists right now because I'm looking at it. My hand is gone. I have no hand, I have no\nbrain, I have no heart. If you looked, you'll see a heart. Whatever I am is this\nreally complicated thing in consciousness. That's what I am. All the stuff that I thought I was is something that I create\non the fly and delete. So this is completely\na radical restructuring of how we think about\npossessions, about identity, about survival of death and so forth. This is completely transformative. But the nice thing is\nthat this whole approach of conscious agents, unlike\nthe spiritual traditions, which has said in some\ncases similar things, they said it imprecisely. This is mathematics. We can actually now begin to say precisely here's the mathematical\nmodel of consciousness, conscious agents. Here's how it maps onto space time, which I should sketch really briefly. And here's why things are ephemeral, and here's why you shouldn't be worried about the ephemeral nature of things, because you're not a little tiny entity inside space and time, quite the opposite. You're the author of space and time. - The I, and the am, and the I am is all kind of emergent\nthrough this whole process of evolution and so on. That's just surface waves, and there's a much deeper ocean that we're trying to figure out here. So you said of the stuff\nyou're thinking about maps to space time, how\ndoes it map to space time? - Right, so just a very, very high level, I'll keep it brief. The structures that the\nphysicists are finding, like the amplituhedron, it turns out they're\njust static structure. They're polytopes. But they, remarkably, most\nof the information in them is contained in permutation matrices. So it's a matrix like an NxN matrix that just has zeros and ones. That contains almost\nall of the information. And they have these\nplotted graphs and so forth that they use to boot up the scattering. You can compute those\nscattering amplitudes almost entirely from these\npermutation matrices. So that's just now from my point of view, I have this conscious agent dynamics. It turns out that the stationary\nthat I was talking about, where the entropy is increasing, all the stationary\ndynamics are sketched out by permutation matrices. So there's a so-called Burkhoff polytope. All the vertices of this polytope, all the points are permutation matrices. All the internal points\nare markovian kernels that have the uniform measure\nas a stationary measure. - I need to intuit a little better what the heck you're talking about. So basically there's some\ncomplicated thing going on with the network of conscious agents. And that's mappable to this. - [Donald] That's right. - You're saying a two dimensional matrix that scattering has to do with\nwhat, with the perception? Like that's like photon stuff or? I mean, I don't know if it's useful to sort of dig into detail. - I'll do just the high level thing. So the high level is, the long-term behavior of\nthe conscious agent dynamics. So that's a projection. Just looking at the long-term behavior I'm hoping will give rise\nto the amplituhedron. The amplituhedron then\ngives rise to space time. And so then I can just use their link to go all the way from consciousness, through its asymptotics, through the amplituhedron,\ninto space time, and get the map all the\nway into our interface. - And that's why you mentioned\nthe permutation matrix, because it gives you a nice\nthing to try to generate. - That's right. It's the connection\nwith the amplituhedron. The permutation matrices are the core of the amplituhedron. And it turns out they're the core of the asymptotic description\nof the conscious agents. - So not to sort of bring\nup the idea of a creator, but first of all, I like video games. And you mentioned this\nkind of simulation idea. First of all, do you think\nof, as an interesting idea, this thought experiment that\nwe live in a simulation? And in general, do you think\nwe live in a simulation? - So Nick Bostrom's idea\nabout the simulation is typically couched in\na physicalist framework. - [Lex] Yes. - So there's the bottom level. There's some programmer\nin a physical space time, and they have a computer\nthat they've programmed brilliantly and cleverly where they've created conscious entities. So you have the hard problem\nof consciousness, right? The standard hard problem. How could a computer simulation\ncreate a consciousness? Which isn't explained by\nthat simulation theory. But then the idea is that the next level, the entities that are created in the first level simulation, then can write their own simulations, and you get this nesting. So the idea that this\nis a simulation is fine, but the idea that it starts\nwith a physicalist base, I think isn't fine. - There's different properties here. The partial rendering. And to me that's the interesting idea is not whether the entirety\nof the universe is simulated, but how efficiently can\nyou create interfaces that are convincing to all other entities that can appreciate such interfaces? How little does it take? Because you said like partial rendering, or like temporal, ephemeral\nrendering of stuff. Only render the tree falling in the forest when there's somebody there to see it. It's interesting to think, how can you do that super efficiently without having to render everything? And that to me is one\nperspective on the simulation, just like it is with video games, right? Where a video game doesn't have to render every single thing. It's just the thing that\nthe observer is looking at. - Right, there is actually,\nthat's a very nice question. And there's whole groups of researchers that are actually studying,\nin virtual reality, what is the sort of minimal\nrequirements on the system? How does it have to operate to give you an immersion experience, to give you the feeling\nthat you have a body, to get you to take it real? And there's actually a\nlot of really good work on that right now. And it turns out it\ndoesn't take that much. You do need to get the\nperception action loop tight, and you have to give them the perceptions that they're expecting\nif you want them to. But if you can lead them along, if you give them\nperceptions that are close to what they're expecting, you can then maybe move\ntheir reality around a bit. - Yeah, it's a tricky engineering problem, especially when you\ntry to create a product that's costs little, but it feels like an engineering problem, not a deeply scientific problem. Meaning, obviously it's\na scientific problem, but as a scientific problem,\nit's not that difficult to trick us descendants of apes. - But here's a case\nfor just us in our own, if this is a virtual reality that we're experiencing right now. So here's something you\ncan try for yourself. If you just close your eyes and look at your\nexperience in front of you, to be aware of your\nexperience in front of you, what you experience is just\nlike a modeled dark gray. There's some dynamics to\nit, but it's just dark gray. But now I ask you, instead of\nhaving your attention forward, put your attention backward. What is it like behind\nyou with your eyes closed? And there it's like nothing. It's really. So what is going on here? What am I experiencing back there? - I don't know if it's nothing. It's like, I guess it's the absence of, it's not even like darkness or something. - It's not even darkness. There's no qualia to it. And yet there is a sense of being, and that's the interesting thing. There's a sense of being back. So I close my eyes, I\nput my attention forward. I have the quality of a gray model thing, but when I put my attention backward, there's no quality at all. But there is a sense of being. - I personally, now you haven't been to that side of the room. I have been to that side of the room. So for me, memories, I start playing the engine of memory\nreplay, which is like, I take myself back in time and think about that place where I was hanging out in that part. That's what I see when I'm behind. So that's an interesting\nquirk of human humans too. We're collecting these experiences and we can replay them in interesting ways whenever we feel like it. And it's almost like being\nthere, but not really, but almost. - That's right. And yet we can go our\nentire lives on this. You're talking about the\nminimal thing for VR. We can go our entire lives and not realize that all of my life, it's been like nothing behind me. We're not even aware\nthat all of our lives, if you just pay attention, close your, pay attention\nto what's behind me, we're like, oh, holy smoke. It's totally scary. I mean, it's like nothing. There's no quality there at all. How did I not notice that my entire life? We're so immersed in the simulation, we buy it so much. - Yeah, I mean you could see\nthis with children, right? With persistence you could\ndo the peekaboo game, you can hide from them and appear, and they're fully tricked. And in the same way we're fully tricked. There's nothing behind us,\nand we assume there is. And that's really interesting. These theories are pretty heavy. You as a human being,\nas a mortal human being, how has these theories\nbeen to you personally? Like, are there good days and bad days, when you wake up and look in the mirror and the fact that you can't\nsee anything behind you, the fact that it's rendered? Like is there interesting quirks, you know Nietzsche with his, if you gaze long into the\nabyss, the abyss gazes into you. How has this theories, these\nideas changed you as a person? - It's been very, very difficult. The stuff is not just\nabstract theory building, because it's about us. Sometimes I've realized that there's this big division of me. My mind is doing all this science and coming up with these conclusions, and the rest of me is not integrating. It's just like, I don't believe it. I just don't believe this. So as I start to take it seriously, I get scared myself. It's like, but it's very much, then I read these spiritual traditions and realize they're saying\nvery, very similar things. There is a lot of conversion. So for me, the first time I thought it might be possible that\nwe're not seeing the truth was in 1986. It was from some\nmathematics we were doing. And when that hit me, it\nhit me like a ton of bricks. I had to sit down. It was scary. It was really a shock to the system. And then to realize that everything that has been important to\nme, like getting a house, getting a car, getting a\nreputation and so forth. Well that car is just like the car I see in the virtual reality. It's there when you perceive\nit and it's not there. So the whole question of\nwhat am I doing and why, what's worthwhile doing in life? Clearly getting a big house\nand getting a big car. I mean, we all knew\nthat we were gonna die. So we tend not to know that. We tend to hide it,\nespecially when we're young. Before age 30, we don't\nbelieve we're gonna die. - We factually maybe know that you kind of are supposed to, yeah. - But they'll figure something out and we'll be the generation\nthat is the first one that doesn't have to die. That's the kind of thing. But when you really face the fact that you're going to die, and then when I start to look at it from this point of view that, well, this thing was an interface to begin with. So is what I'm really gonna be doing just taking off a headset. So I've been playing in a\nvirtual reality game all day, and I got lost in the game, and I was fighting over a Porsche. And I shot some guys up and\nI punctured their tires, but I got the Porsche. Now I take the headset\noff, and what was that for? Nothing. It was just a data structure\nand the data structure is gone. So all of the wars, the\nfighting and the reputations and all this stuff, it is just a headset. And so my theory says that intellectually, my mind, my emotions\nrebel all over the place. And so I have to mention,\nI meditate a lot. - What percent of the day would you say you spend as a physicalist\nsort of living life, pretending your car matters,\nyour reputation matter? Like how much, what's that Tom Waits song? I like my town with a\nlittle drop of poison. How much poison do you\nallow yourself to have? - I think my default mode is physicalist. I think that that's just the default. When I'm not being conscious, consciously attentive. - Intellectually consciously attentive. Because if you're just, you're still, if you're tasting coffee and\nnot thinking, or drinking, or just taking in the sunset,\nyou're not being intellectual. But you're still experiencing it. So it's when you turn on\nthe introspective machine, that's when you can start. - And turn off the thinker. When I actually just start\nlooking without thinking. So that's when I feel like all of a sudden I'm starting to see through, it's sort of like, okay,\npart of part of the addiction to the interface is all the\nstories I'm telling about it. It's really important for me to get that, really important to do that. So I'm telling all these stories, and so I'm all wrapped up,\nalmost all of the mind stuff that's going on in my\nhead is about attachment to the interface. And so what I've found is that, essentially the only way to\nreally detach from the interface is to literally let go\nof thoughts altogether. And then all of a\nsudden, even my identity, my whole history, my name, my education and all this stuff is almost irrelevant because it's just now,\nhere is the present moment. And this is the reality right now. And all of that other stuff\nis an interface story. But this conscious experience right now, this is the only reality\nas far as I can tell. The rest of it's a story. But that is, again, not my default, that is I have to make a\nreally conscious choice to say, okay, I know intellectually this is all an interface. I'm gonna take the\nheadset off and so forth. And then immediately\nsink back into the game and just be out there playing the game and get lost in it. So I'm always lost in the game unless I literally consciously\nchoose to stop thinking. - Isn't it terrifying to acknowledge that, to look beyond the game? - Scares the hell outta me. It really is scary. Because I'm so attached,\nI'm attached to this body, I'm attached to the interface. - Are you ever worried about\nbreaking your brain a bit? Meaning like it's, I mean, some of these ideas\nwhen you think about reality, even with like Einstein, just\nrealizing you said interface, just realizing that light,\nthat there's a speed of light, and you can't go faster\nthan the speed of light, and like what kind of things black holes can do with light. Even that can mess with your head. - [Donald] Yes. - But that's still space time. - That's a big mess, but\nit's still just space time. It's still a property of our interface. That's right. - Even Einstein realized\nthat this particular thing, some of the stories you tell ourselves is constructing interfaces that are oversimplifying\nthe way things work. Because it's nice. The stories are nice. Stories are nice. That's why, I mean, just like\nvideo games, they're nice. - Right, but Einstein\nwas a realist, right? He was a famous realist, in the sense that he was very explicit, in a 1935 paper with Petuskin\nRosen, the EPR paper, right? They said, if without in\nany way disturbing a system, I can predict with probability one the outcome of a measurement, then there exists in reality\nthat element, that value. And we now know from quantum\ntheory that that's false. That Einstein's idea of local realism is strictly speaking false. And so we can predict, in quantum theory, you can set up, and there's a paper by Chris Fuchs, quantum bayesianism,\nwhere he scouts this out. It was done by other people, but he gives a good presentation of this, where they have a sequence of something like nine\ndifferent quantum measurements that you can make. And you can predict with probability one what a particular outcome will be, but you can actually\nprove that it's impossible that the value existed before\nyou made the measurement. So you know with probability\none what you're gonna get, but you also know with certainty that that value was not there until you made the measurement. So we know from quantum theory that the act of observation\nis an act of fact creation. And that is built into what I'm saying with this theory of consciousness. If consciousness is fundamental, space time itself is an\nact of fact creation. It's an interface that we create, consciousness creates,\nplus all the objects in it. So local realism is not true. Quantum theory has established that. Also non-con contextual\nrealism is not true. And that fits in perfectly with this idea that consciousness is fundamental. These things exist as data\nstructures when we create them. As Chris Fuchs says,\nthe act of observation is an act of fact creation. But I must say, on a personal level, I'm having to spend, I\nspend a couple hours a day just sitting in meditation on this and facing the rebellion in\nme that goes to the core. It feels like it goes\nto the core of my being. Rebellion against these ideas. So here it is very, very\ninteresting for me to look at this because, so here I'm a\nscientist and I'm a person. The science is really clear. Local realism is false. Non-contextual realism is false. Space time is doomed. It's very, very clear. It couldn't be clearer. And my emotions rebel left and right. When I sit there and say,\nokay, I am not something in space and time, then\nsomething inside of me says, you're crazy. Of course you are. And I'm completely attached to it. I'm completely attached to all this stuff. I'm attached to my body,\nI'm attached to the headset, I'm attached to my car,\nattached to people. I'm attached to all of it. And yet I know as an absolute fact, I'm gonna walk away from all of it. I'm gonna die. In fact, I almost died last year. Covid almost killed me. I sent a goodbye text to my\nwife, so I thought I was. - [Lex] You really did? - I sent her a goodbye. I was in the emergency room, and it had attacked my heart, and it had been at 190 beats\nper minute for 36 hours. I couldn't last much longer, I knew it. They couldn't stop it. - [Lex] So that was it. - So that was it. So I texted her goodbye\nfrom the emergency room. - [Lex] I love you, goodbye kind of thing? - Yeah, right. Yeah, that was it. - [Lex] Were you afraid? - Yeah, it scares the hell of you, right? But there was, you're\njust feeling so bad anyway that sort of, you're scared,\nbut you're just feeling so bad that in some sense you just\nwant it to stop anyway. So I've been there and\nfaced it just a year ago. - How did that change you, by the way, having this intellectual\nreality that's so challenging that you meditate on, that\nit is just an interface, and one of the hardest\nthings to come to terms with is that that means that it's gonna end. How did that change you\nhaving come so close to the reality of it? It's not just an intellectual reality. It's a reality of death. - It's forced, I've\nmeditated for 20 years now, and I would say averaging\nthree or four hours a day. But it's put a new urgency, but urgency is not the right word. It's riveted my attention,\nI'll put it that way. It's really riveted my attention. And I've really paid, I've spent a lot more time looking at what spiritual traditions say. I don't, by the way, again, take it all with a grain of salt. But on the other hand, I think it's stupid for me to ignore it. So I try to listen to the best ideas and to sort out nonsense from. And it's just we all have to\ndo it for ourselves, right? It's not easy. So what makes sense, and I have the advantage of some science, so I can look at what science\nsays and try to compare with spiritual tradition. I try to sort it out for myself. But then I also look and realize that there's\nanother aspect to me, which is this whole emotional aspect. I seem to be wired up, as evolutionary psychology\nsays I'm wired up, right? All these defensive mechanisms, I'm inclined to lie if I need to. I'm inclined to be angry, to protect myself, to have\nan ingroup and an outgroup, to try to make my reputation\nas big as possible to try to demean the outgroup. There's all these things that evolutionary psychology is spot on. It is really brilliant\nabout the human condition. And yet I think evolution, as\nI said, evolutionary theory is a projection of a deeper theory where there may be no competition. So I'm in this very interesting position where I feel like, okay,\naccording to my own theory, I'm consciousness. And maybe this is what it means for consciousness to wake up. It's not easy. It's almost like I have, I feel like I have real skin in the game. It really is scary. I really was scared\nwhen I was about to die. It really was hard to\nsay goodbye to my wife. It really pained. And to then look at that,\nand then look at the fact that I'm gonna walk away from this anyway, and it's just an interface. How do I, so it's trying to\nput all this stuff together and really grock it, so to speak. Not just intellectually, but grock it at an emotional level. - Yeah, what are you afraid of, you silly evolved organism\nthat's gotten way too attached to the interface? What are you really afraid of? - [Donald] That's right. - Is there a. - Very personal, you know,\nit's very, very personal. - I mean, speaking of that text, what do you think is\nthis whole love thing? What's the role of love\nin our human condition, this interface thing we have? Is this somehow interweaved, interconnected with consciousness, this attachment we have to other humans and this deep, there's some quality to it that seems very interesting, peculiar. - Well, there are two levels\nI would think about that. There's love in the sexual sense, and then there's love in a deeper sense. And in the sexual sense, we can give an evolutionary\naccount of that and so forth. And I think that's pretty clear to people in this deeper sense, right? So of course I married, I love\nmy wife in a sexual sense. But there's a deeper sense as well. When I was saying goodbye to her, there was a much deeper love that was really at play there. That's one place where I think that the mixed bag from\nspiritual traditions has something right. When they say love your\nneighbor as yourself, that in some sense love is fundamental. I think that they're onto something, something very, very deep and profound. And every once in a while I can get a personal glimpse of that. Especially when I'm in\nthe space with no thought. When I can really let go of thoughts, I get little glimpses of a love in the sense that I'm not separate. It's a love in the sense that\nI'm not different from that. If you and I are separate,\nthen I can fight you. But if you and I are the\nsame, there's a union there. - The togetherness of it. Who's God? All those gods, the stories that have been told\nthroughout history, you said, through the spiritual traditions. What do you think that is? Is that us trying to find\nthat common thing at the core? - Well in many traditions, not all, the one I was raised in, so my dad was a Protestant minister, we tend to think of God as a being. But I think that that's not right. I think the closest way to\nthink about God is being period, not a being, but being, the very ground of being itself is God. I think that's the deep,\nand from my point of view, that's the ground of consciousness. So the ground of conscious\nbeing is what we might call God. But the word God has\nalways been, for example, you don't believe the same God is my God, so I'm gonna fight you. We will have wars over, because the being, the specific being that you call God is different from the\nbeing that I call God, and so we fight. Whereas if it's not a\nbeing, but just being, and you and I share being, then you and I are not separate and there's no reason to fight. We're both part of that one being, and loving you is loving myself. Because we're all part of that one being. The spiritual traditions\nthat point to that I think are pointing in a\nvery interesting direction. And that does seem to\nmatch with the mathematics of the conscious agent stuff that I've been working on as well. It really fits with that. Although that wasn't my goal. - Is there, you mentioned that the young physicist\nthat you talked to, or whose work you follow,\nhave quite a lot of fun breaking with the traditions of the past, the assumptions of the past. What advice would you\ngive to young people today in high school and college? Not just physicists, but in general, how to have a career they can be proud of, how they can have a life\nthey can be proud of, how to make their way in\nthe world from the lessons, from the wins and the\nlosses in your own life. What little insights could you pull out? - I would say the universe\nis a lot more interesting than you might expect. And you are a lot more\nspecial and interesting than you might expect. You might think that you're just a little, tiny, irrelevant 100\npound, 200 pound person in a vast billions of\nlight years across space. And that's not the case. You are in some sense the being that's creating that space all the time, every time you look. So waking up to who you really are outside of space and time, as the author of space and time, as the author of everything that you see. - The author of space and\ntime that's beautiful, sorry. - You're the author of space and time, and I'm the author of space and time, and space and time is just\none little data structure. Many other consciousnesses are creating other data structures, they're authors of various other things. So realizing, and then realizing that, I had this feeling growing\nup, going to college, reading all these textbooks,\noh man, it's all been done. If I'd just been there 50 years ago I could have discovered this stuff, but it's all in the textbooks now. Well, believe me, the\ntextbooks are gonna look silly in 50 years, and it's your\nchance to write the new textbook. So, of course study the current textbooks, you have to understand them. There's no way to progress until you understand what's been done. But then the only limit is\nyour imagination, frankly. That's the only limit. - The greatest books,\nthe greatest textbooks ever written on Earth\nare yet to be written. - [Donald] Exactly. - What do you think is the\nmeaning of this whole thing? What's the meaning of life\nfrom your limited interface? Can you figure it all out? Like why, so you said the\nuniverse is kind of trying to figure itself out through us. Why? - Yeah, that's the closest I've come. So I'll give you, so I\nwill say that I don't know, but here's my guess. - Good first sentence. That's a good starting point. - And maybe that's\ngonna be a profound part of the final answer is to\nstart with the, I don't know. It is quite possible that\nthat's really important to start with the I don't know. My guess is that if\nconsciousness is fundamental, and if Godel's incompleteness\nthe holds here, and there's infinite variety of structures for consciousness to some sense explore, that maybe that's what it's about. This is something that\nAnnaka and I talked about a little bit, and she doesn't like this way of talking about it. And so I'm gonna have to\ntalk with her some more about this way of talking. But right now I'll just put it this way and I'll have to talk with her more and see if I can say it more clearly. But the way I'm talking\nabout it now is that there's a sense in which there's being, and then there's experiences, or forums that come out of being. That's one deep, deep mystery. And the question that you\nasked, what is it all about? Somehow it's related to that. Why does being, why doesn't it\njust stay without any forms? Why do we have experiences? Why not just have, when you close your eyes and pay attention to what's behind you, there's\nnothing, but there's being. Why don't we just stop there? Why didn't we just stop there? Why did we create all tables and chairs, and the sun, and moon, and people, all this really complicated stuff? Why? And all I can guess right now, and I'll probably kick\nmyself in a couple years and say, that was dumb, but\nall I can guess right now is that somehow consciousness\nwakes up to itself by knowing what it's not. So here I am, I'm not this body. And I sort of saw that,\nit was sort of in my face when I sent a text goodbye. But then as soon as I'm\nbetter sort of like, okay, I sort of don't wanna go there, right? So I am my body, I go back\nto the standard thinking, I am my body, and then\nI want to get that car. Even though I was just\nabout to die a year ago, so that comes rushing back. So consciousness immerses itself fully into a particular headset, gets lost in it, and then slowly wakes up. - Just so it can escape, and that is the waking up. But it needs to have negative. - [Donald] It needs to know what it's not. To know what you are, you have to say, oh, I'm not that, I'm not\nthat, that wasn't important, that wasn't important. - That's really powerful. Don, let me just say that, because I've been a\nlong term fan of yours, and we're supposed to have a conversation during this very difficult\nmoment in your life. Let me just say you're\na truly special person, and I, for one, I know there's\na lot of others that agree. I'm glad that you're still\nhere with us on this earth, if for a short time. So whatever the universe,\nwhatever plan it has for you that brought you close to death, to maybe enlighten you some kind of way, I think it has an\ninteresting plan for you. You're one of the truly special humans, and it's a huge honor that you would sit and talk with me today. Thank you so much. - Thank you very much, Lex,\nI really appreciate that. Thank you. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Donald Hoffman. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein, relevant to the ideas\ndiscussed in this conversation. \"Time and space are\nmodes by which we think and not conditions in which we live.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
