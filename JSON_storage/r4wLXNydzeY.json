He teaches, speaks and writes\nabout the nature of power and war on the global\nstage in history and today. Please allow me to say once again, my hope for this little journey I'm on, I will speak to everyone on\nall sides with compassion, with empathy, and with backbone. I'll speak with Vladimir Putin and with Vladimir Zelensky, with Russians, and with Ukrainians, with Israelis, and with Palestinians, with everyone. My goal is to do whatever small part I can to decrease the amount\nof suffering in the world by trying to reveal our common humanity. I believe that in the\nend, truth and love wins. I will get attacked for being naive, for being a shell, for being weak. I'm none of those things, but I do make mistakes\nand I will get better. I love you all. This is a \"Lex Fridman Podcast,\" to support it to please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's John Mearsheimer."

      "section": "Power",
      "text": "Can you explain your view on\npower in international politics as outlined in your book, \"The Tragedy of Great Power Politics\" and in your writing since then? - Yeah, I make two sets of points there. First of all, I believe that power is the currency of\ninternational relations. And by that I mean that\nstates are deeply interested in the balance of power and they're interested in\nmaximizing how much power they control. And the question is why states\ncare so much about power. In the international system,\nthere's no higher authority. So, if you get into\ntrouble and you dial 911, there's nobody at the other end. And a system like that,\nyou have no choice, but to figure out for yourself\nhow best to protect yourself. And the best way to protect\nyourself is to be powerful, to have as much power as you can possibly gain\nover all the other states in the system. Therefore, states care about power, because it enhances or maximizes their prospects for survival. Second point I would make is that in the real story or in my story, power is largely a function\nof material factors. The two key building blocks of power are population size and wealth. You wanna have a lot of people and you want to be really wealthy. Of course, this is why the\nUnited States is so powerful. It has lots of people and\nit has lots of wealth. China was not considered a\ngreat power until recently, because it didn't have a lot of wealth, certainly had population size,\nbut it didn't have wealth. And without both a large\npopulation and much wealth, you're usually not\nconsidered a great power. So, I think power matters, but when we talk about power, it's important to understand\nthat it's population size and wealth that are underpinning it. - So there's a lot of\ninteresting things there. First you said nations in relation to each other are, is essentially in a state of anarchism. - Yeah, well, anarchy basically means the opposite of hierarchy. Sometimes people think when\nyou're talking about anarchy, you're talking about murder and mayhem, but that's not what anarchy\nmeans in the realist context. Anarchy simply means that\nyou don't have hierarchy. There's no higher authority\nthat sits above states. States are like pool\nballs on a table, right? And in an anarchic world, there's no higher authority that you can turn to if\nyou get into trouble. And of course the political philosopher who laid this all out was Thomas Hobbes. And Hobbes talked about\nlife in the state of nature. And in the state of nature\nyou have individuals and those individuals compete\nwith each other for power. And the reason that they do is because in the state\nof nature, by definition, you have no higher authority. And Hobbes's view is\nthat the way to get out of this terrible situation where individuals are\ncompeting with each other and even killing each\nother is to create a state. It's what he calls the Leviathan. And that, of course is the\ntitle of his famous book. So, the idea is to escape anarchy, you create a state and that means you go\nfrom anarchy to hierarchy. The problem in international politics is that there is no world\nstate, there is no hierarchy. And if you have no hierarchy and you're in an anarchic system, you have no choice but to try to maximize your relative power to make sure you are, as we used to say when I was a kid on New York City playgrounds, the biggest and baddest dude on the block. Not because you necessarily\nwant to beat up on other kids or on other states, but because again, that's\nthe best way to survive. And as I like to point out to people, the best example of what happens when you're weak in international politics is what the Chinese call the\nCentury of National Humiliation from the late 1840s to the late 1940s, the Chinese were remarkably weak and the great powers in the\nsystem preyed upon them. And that sends a very important message to not only the Chinese, but\nto other states in the system. Don't be weak, be as powerful as you can. - And we'll talk about it. But humiliation can lead to resentment or resentment leads to\nsomething you've also studied, which is Nazi Germany in the 1930s. We'll talk about it. But staying to the psychology\nand philosophy picture, what's the connection\nbetween the will to power in the individual, as you mentioned and the will to power in a nation? - The will to power in an individual has a lot to do with\nindividual psychology. The story that I tell\nabout the pursuit of power, it a structural argument. It's an argument that says when you are in a particular structure, when you're in a system that\nhas a specific architecture, which is anarchy, the states have no choice\nbut to compete for power. So, structure is really\ndriving the story here. Will to power has a lot more\nto do with an individual in the Nietzsche story where\nthat concept comes from. So, it's very important to\nunderstand that I'm not arguing that states are inherently\naggressive, right? My point is that as long\nas states are in anarchy, they have no choice but to\nbehave in an aggressive fashion. But if you went to a hierarchic system, there's no reason for those states to worry about the balance of power, because if they get into trouble, there is a higher authority\nthat they can turn to. There is in effect a leviathan. - So, what is the role of military might in this will to power\non the national level? - Well, military mights is\nwhat ultimately matters, as I said to you before, the\ntwo building blocks of power are population size and wealth. - You didn't mention military mights? - I did not. No, that's right. And it's good that you caught that, because if you have a large population and you're a wealthy country, what you do is you build a large military and it's ultimately the size\nof your military that matters, because militaries fight wars. And if states are\nconcerned about survival, which I argue is the\nprinciple goal of every state in the international system for what I think are obvious reasons, then they're gonna care about\nhaving a powerful military that can protect them if\nanother state comes after them. - Well, it's not obvious\nthat a large nation with a lot of people and a lot of money, should necessarily build a gigantic army and seek to attain superpower, like dominant soul, superpower\nstatus to military might. But you're saying as\nyou see the world today, it has to be that way. - Yeah, I'm arguing it is obvious. If you're a state in the\ninternational system, do you wanna be weak if you\nlive next door to Nazi Germany or Imperial Germany, or Napoleonic France, or even the United States? The United States is a\nruthless great power. You surely recognize that. And if you're dealing with\nthe United States of America and you're Vladimir Putin, you wanna make sure you're\nas powerful as possible, so that the United States\ndoesn't put its gun sites on you and come after you. Same thing is true with China. You wanna be powerful in\nthe international system. States understand that and they go to great\nlengths to become powerful. Just take the United States of America when it started in 1783, it was comprised of 13 measly colonies, strung out along the Atlantic seaboard. Over time the various leaders of the United States went to great lengths to turn that country\ninto the dominant power in the Western hemisphere. And then once that was achieved in 1900, we've gone to great lengths to make sure that there's no peer\ncompetitor in the system. We just wanna make sure\nthat we're number one. And my argument is that this is not peculiar to the United States. If I'm China, for example, today I would want to dominate Asia, the way the United States\ndominates the Western hemisphere. They'd be fools not to. If I were imperial Germany, I'd want to dominate all of Europe the way the United States\ndominates the Western hemisphere. Why? Because if you dominate all of Europe, assuming you're Imperial\nGermany or Napoleonic France, then no other state in\nthe area or in the region can threaten you because\nyou're simply so powerful. And again, what I'm saying here is that the structure of the international\nsystem really matters. It's the fact that you're\nin this anarchic system where survival is your principle goal. And where I can't know\nyour intentions, right? You're another state. I can't know that at some point\nyou might not come after me. You might. And if you're really powerful and I'm not, I'm in deep trouble. - Yeah, so some of the ideas\non underlying what you've said, offensive realism, which I would love to talk to you about, sort of the history of\nrealism versus liberalism. But some of the ideas\nyou already mentioned, anarchy between states, everybody's trying to develop\na military capabilities, uncertainty, such an interesting concept. States cannot be sure that other states, will not use military\ncapabilities against them, which is one- - That's of enormous\nimportance to the story. - And so interesting, because you also say that this\nmakes realists more cautious and more peaceful, the uncertainty, because of all the\nuncertainty involved here, it's better to approach\ninternational politics with caution, which is really\ninteresting to think about, again, survival most states\ninterested in survival. And the other interesting thing is you assume all the states are rational, which- - Most of the time. - Most of the time. You call this framework offensive realism. Can you just give a overview\nof the history of the realism, versus liberalism debate as worldviews? - Well, I think for many centuries now, the big divide within the world of international relations theory is between realism and liberalism. These are time honored bodies of theory. And before I tell you what I think the differences are between those two bodies of theory, it is important to emphasize that there are differences among realists and differences among liberals. And so when you talk about\nme as an offensive realist, you should understand that there are also\ndefensive realists out there and there are a panoply of\nliberal theories as well. But basically, realists believe that power matters, that states compete for power and that war is an\ninstrument of statecraft. And liberals on the other hand, have what I would say is\na more idealistic view of the world. This is not to say that\nthey're naive or foolish, but they believe there are\naspects of international politics that lead to a less competitive and more peaceful world\nthan most realists see. And I'll lay out for you very quickly, what are the three major\nliberal theories today that I think will give you a sense of the more optimistic perspective that is inherent in\nthe liberal enterprise. The first and most important\nof the liberal theories is democratic peace theory. And this is a theory\nthat says democracies, do not fight against other democracies. So, the more the world is\npopulated with democracies, the less likely it is\nthat we will have wars. And this basic argument is inherent in Francis Fukuyama's\n\"The End of History.\" He argues that democracy\ntriumph first over fascism in the 20th century, it then triumphed over communism. And that means that in the future we're gonna have more and\nmore liberal democracies on the planet. And if you have more and\nmore liberal democracies and those democracies\ndon't fight each other, then you have a more peaceful world. That was his argument. It's a very liberal argument. A realist like me would say that it doesn't matter whether a state is a democracy or not, all states behave the same way, because the structure of the system, getting back to our earlier discussion, about international anarchy, the structure of the system\nleaves those states no choice, whether they're\ndemocracies or autocracies. And again, the liberal view, this first liberal theory is that democracies don't\nfight other democracies and therefore the more\ndemocracies you have, the more peaceful the world. - Can I just sort of try to\nunpack that a little bit? So, on the democratic peace theory, I guess would say that in\ndemocracies leaders are elected and the underlying assumption\nis most people want peace and so they will elect peacemakers. And so the more you democracies you have, the more likely you have peace. And then the realist perspective, says that it doesn't matter if the majority of people want peace, the structure of international politics is such that superpowers\nwant to become more super and powerful, and they\ndo that through war. - You can't make that argument that you're making about democracies, because if you're saying that democracies are inclined toward peace\nand that the picks leaders who are inclined towards peace, then you have to show that democracies are in\ngeneral more peaceful than non-democracies. And you can't support that argument. You can find lots of evidence\nto support the argument that democracies don't\nfight other democracies. So, the argument I believe\nthat you have to make, if you're gonna support\ndemocratic peace theory, the main argument you have to make is that liberal democracies\nhave a healthy respect for each other and they can\nassess each other's intentions. If you're a liberal democracy\nand I'm a liberal democracy, we know we have value systems\nthat argue against aggression and argue for peaceful\nresolution of crises. And therefore, given these\nnorms, we can trust each other, we can know each other's intentions. Remember for realists like me, uncertainty about intentions\nreally helps drive the train. But if you're talking\nabout two democracies, the argument there is that they know each other's intentions. - And for you, sure, maybe democracies reduce\nuncertainty a little bit, but not enough to stop the train. - I think that's right. Yeah, that's right. So, that's democratic peace theory. - [Lex] Yes. - The second theory is economic\ninterdependence theory. And that's the argument\nthat in a globalized world, like the one that we live in and have lived in for a long time, there's a great deal of\neconomic interdependence. And if you and I are two countries, or if you and me are two countries and we're economically interdependent and we're both getting prosperous as a result of this economic intercourse, the last thing that we're\ngonna do is start a war, either one of us, because who would kill the\ngoose that lays the golden eggs? It's that kind of argument. So, there you have an argument that economic interdependence\nleads to peace. And then the third liberal argument has to do with institutions, sometimes referred to as\nliberal institutionalism. And this is the argument that if you can get\nstates into institutions where they become rule abiding actors, they will obey the rules\nthat dictate that war is not acceptable. So, if you get them to accept the UN rules on when you can and cannot initiate a war, then you'll have a more peaceful world. So, those are the liberal theories and as you can tell, they're very different from realism as articulated by somebody like me. - Can you maybe argue against\nthe economic interdependence and in the institutions\nfollow rules a little bit? So, the golden goose with the golden egg, you're saying that nations\nare happy to kill the goose, because again, they want power. - If they think it's necessary\nto kill the golden goose, because of security\nconcerns, they will do it. The point is that economic\ninterdependence at its root has prosperity as the core variable. - Yeah. - In the realest story the\ncore variable is survival. And survival always trumps prosperity. So, if you go back to the\nperiod before World War I, we're in Europe, it's 1913 or early 1914, what you see is that you have an intense\nsecurity competition, between all of the great powers. On one side you have The Triple Alliance and on the other side you\nhave the Triple Entente. You have these two alliances, and you have an intense\nsecurity competition, between them, okay? At the same time, you have a great deal of\neconomic interdependence. It's amazing how much economic intercourse is taking place in Europe\namong all the actors, right? And people are getting prosperous. Our countries are getting\nprosperous as a result. But nevertheless, in the\nfamous July crisis of 1914, this economic prosperity is\nunable to prevent World War I, because security concerns or\nsurvival is more important. So, there are going to\nbe lots of situations where prosperity and\nsurvival come into conflict and in those cases, survival will win. - And maybe you can speak\nto the different camps of realists. You said offensive and defensive. Can you draw a distinction\nbetween those two? - Yeah, let me just back\nup a bit on that one. And you were talking about\nwill to power before. The first big divide between\nrealists is structural realists and human nature realists. - [Lex] Nice. - And Hans Morgenthau, who was influenced by nature and therefore had that will to power logic embedded in his thinking about\nhow the world works, right? He was a human nature realist, okay? I'm a structural realist and I believe it's not human nature. It's not individuals in some will to power that drives competition and war. What drives competition in war is the structure of the system. It's anarchy. - So, you're not as romantic\nas the human nature realists? - Yeah, there's just a world\nof difference between the two. - [Lex] Sure. It's just important to understand that. - So within that, from the structural that\nthere's a subdivision also of offensive and defensive? - Yes. Inside the structural\nrealist world, right? And you have a handful of realists who believe that the structure of the system fosters\ncompetition, for sure, security competition, but it really rules out great\npower war almost all the time. So, it makes sense to care\nabout the balance of power, but to focus on maintaining\nhow much power you have. That's the defensive realism, maintaining how much power you have, not trying to gain more power, because the argument the\ndefensive realists make is that if you try to gain more power, the system will punish you. The structure will punish you. I'm not a defensive realist,\nI'm an offensive realist. And my argument is that\nstates look for opportunities to gain more power. And every time they see or almost every time\nthey see an opportunity to gain more power and they think the\nlikelihood of success is high and the cost will not be great, they'll jump at that opportunity. - Just to linger on the\nhuman nature perspective, how do you explain\nHitler and Nazi Germany,"

      "section": "Hitler",
      "text": "just one of the more recent\naggressive expansions, through military might? How do you explain that in the framework of offensive realism? - Well, I think that Nazi\nGermany was driven in large part by structural considerations. And I think if you look\nat Imperial Germany, which was largely responsible\nfor starting World War I and of course Nazi Germany's\nlargely responsible for starting World War II, what that tells you is you\ndidn't need Adolf Hitler to start World War I, right? And I believe that there is a good chance you would've had World War II in the absence of Hitler, right? I believe that Germany was very powerful, it was deeply worried about\nthe balance of power in Europe, and it had strong incentives\nto behave aggressively in the late 1930s, early 1940s. So, I believe that structure mattered. However, I want to qualify that\nin the case of Adolf Hitler, because I do think he\nhad what you would call a will to power. I've never used that word\nto describe him before, but it's consistent with\nmy point that I often make, that there are two leaders or there have been two\nleaders in modern history who are congenital aggressors, and one was Napoleon and\nthe other was Hitler. Now, if you wanna call\nthat a will to power, you can do that. I'm more comfortable referring to Hitler as a congenital aggressor and referring to Napoleon\nas a congenital aggressor. Although there were important\ndifferences between the two, because Hitler was probably the most murderous leader\nin recorded history, and Napoleon was not in\nthat category at all. But both of them were driven by what you would call a will to power. And that has to be married\nto the structural argument in Hitler's case and\nalso in Napoleon's case. - Is there some degree on the human psychology\nside that resentment, because of what happened\nafter World War I, led to Hitler wooly so much power and then Hitler starting World War II. So, this is the human side. Perhaps the reason I asked that question is also because you mentioned\nthe century of humiliation on the China side. So, to which degree did\nhumiliation lead to Hitler and lead to World War II? - Well, the question of what led to Hitler is a very different question than the question of\nwhat led to World War II, once Hitler was in power. I mean, after January\n30th, 1933, he's in power. And in the question of what is driving him\ncomes racing to the fore, is there resentment over\nthe Versailles Treaty and what happened to Germany? Yes. Did that matter? Yes. But my argument is that structure was the principle factor driving\nthe train in Hitler's case. But what I'm saying here is that there were other factors as well, resentment being one\nof them, will to power or the fact that he was\na congenital aggressor in my lexicon, certainly mattered as well. So, I don't want to dismiss\nyour point about resentment. - So, Hitler in particular, the way he wielded, the way he gained so much power, might have been the general\nresentment of the populace, of the German populace? - I think that as a result\nof defeat in World War I and all the trials and\ntribulations associated with Weimar Germany and then the coming of\nthe Great Depression, all of those factors definitely account for his coming to power. I think that one of the reasons that he was so successful at\nwinning over the German people, once he came to power, was because there was a\ngreat deal of resentment in the German body politic. And he played on that resentment that surely helped him get elected too. But I think having studied the case, it was even more important\nonce he took over. I also believe that one\nof the principle reasons that he was so popular and he was wildly popular\ninside Nazi Germany, is because he was the only leader of an industrialized country who pulled his country\noutta the depression. And that really mattered and\nit made him very effective. It's also worth noting that he was a remarkably\ncharismatic individual. I find that hard to believe, 'cause every time I look at\nhim or listen to his speeches, he does not appear to\nbe charismatic to me. But I've talked to a number of people who are experts on this subject who assure me that he\nwas very charismatic. And I would note to you, if you look at public\nopinion polls in Germany, west Germany in the late 1940s, this is the late 1940s after\nthe Third Reich is destroyed in 1945, he's still remarkably\npopular in the polls. - Stalin is still popular in\nmany parts of Eastern Europe. - Yeah, yeah. And Stalin's popular in many quarters, inside Russia and Stalin\nmurdered more of his own people than he murdered people\noutside of the Soviet Union. - And still to you, the ties of history\nturned not on individuals, but on structural considerations. So, Hitler may be a surface layer, characteristics of how\nGermany started war, but not the really, the reason. - Well, history is a\nmultidimensional phenomenon. - [Lex] So I hear. - We're talking about\ninterstate relations here. - [Lex] Yes. - And realism is a theory\nabout how states interact with each other. And there are many other dimensions to international politics. And if you're talking, about someone like Adolf Hitler, right? Why did he start World War II is a very different question than why did he start the Holocaust or why did he push forward a Holocaust? I mean, that's a different question. And realism doesn't answer that question. So, I want to be very clear that, I'm not someone who argues\nthat realism answers, every question about\ninternational politics, but it does answer what is one of the big, if not the biggest questions\nthat IR scholars care about, which is what causes security competition and what causes great power war. - Does offensive realism answer the question why Hitler\nattacked the Soviet Union? - [John] Yes. - Because from a military\nstrategy perspective, there's pros and cons to that decision. - Pros and cons to every decision. The question is, did he think that he could win\na quick and decisive victory? And he did. I mean, as did his generals,\nit's very interesting. I've spent a lot of time\nstudying German decision making. In World War II if you look at the German decision to invade Poland on September 1st, 1939 and you look at the German\ndecision invade France on May 10th, 1940 and then the Soviet\nUnion on June 22nd, 1941, what you see is there was\nactually quite a bit of resistance to Hitler in 1938 at the time\nof Czechoslovakia Munich. And there was also quite\na bit of resistance in September, 1939. - Internally or you mean- - Internally, internally for sure, yeah. Yeah people had doubts. They didn't think the Weimar was ready. And given the fact that World War I had just ended about 20 years before the thought of starting\nanother European War was not especially attractive to lots of German policy makers,\nincluding military leaders. And then came France 1940 in\nthe run up to May 10th, 1940, there was huge resistance in the German army to attacking France. But that was eventually eliminated, because they came up with a clever plan, the Manstein Plan. If you look at the decision\nto invade the Soviet Union on June 22nd, 1941, which is the only case where they fail, they succeeded in France,\nthey succeeded in Poland, they succeeded at Munich in 1938. Soviet Union is where they fail. There's hardly any\nresistance at all, right? - Yeah, well, and to say that\nthey failed the Soviet Union, I mean, my grandfather fought, I mean, I'm from the Soviet Union, there's a lot of successes early on. So, there's poor military, I would say strategic\ndecisions along the way, but it caught Stalin off guard. Maybe you can correct me, but from my perspective, terrifyingly so they\ncould have been successful if certain different decisions were made from a military perspective. - Yeah, I've always had the sense they came terrifyingly close to winning. - [Lex] Yeah. - You can make the opposite argument that they were doomed. But I'm not terribly comfortable\nmaking that argument. I think the Weimar by the summer of 1941 was a finely tuned instrument for war. And the Red Army was in\nquite terrible shape. Stalin had purged the Officer Corps, they had performed poorly in Finland and there were all sorts of reasons to think that they were no\nmatch for the match for Weimar. And if you look at what happened in the initial stages of the conflict, that proved to be the case. The Germans won a lot of significant tactical\nvictories early on. - And if they focused and went to Moscow as quickly as possible,\nis again, terrifyingly, so could have been a, basically topple Stalin. And one thing that's- - [John] That's possible.\n- That's possible. - Fortunately we're not gonna\nrun the experiment again, but one could argue that\nhad they concentrated as the generals wanted to do\nin going straight from Moscow, that they would've won. I mean, what Hitler wanted to do is he wanted to go into the Ukraine. I mean, Hitler thought that the main axis, there were three axis, the northern axis went towards Leningrad, the central axis of course went to Moscow, and then the southern axis, Army Group south headed towards Ukraine and deep into the Caucasus. And Hitler believed that\nshould have been the main axis. And in fact, in 1942,\nthe Soviets, excuse me, the Germans go back on\nthe offensive in 1942. This is Operation Blue, and the main axis in '42\nis deep into the Ukraine and into the Caucasus. And that fails. But one could argue that\nhad they done that in '41, had they not gone to\nMoscow, had they gone, had they concentrated on\ngoing deep into Ukraine and into the Caucasus, they could have knocked\nthe Soviets out that way. I'm not sure that in\nthe end, I believe that. I think in the end, the Soviets\nwould've won no matter what. But I'm not a hundred\npercent sure of that. - So, sometimes maybe you can educate me, but so sometimes they say, just like with Napoleon winter\ndefeated Hitler in Russia. I think not often enough\npeople tell the story of the soldiers and the motivation\nand how hard they fight. So, it turns out that\nUkrainians and Russians are not easy to conquer. They're the kinds of\npeople that don't roll over and fight bravely. There seems to be a\ndifference in certain people, peoples in how they see war, how they approach war, how proud they are to\nfight for their country, to die for their country,\nthese kinds of things. So, I think Battle of Stalingrad tells, at least to me, a story of\nextremely brave fighting on the Soviet side, and that it's a component of war too. It's not just structural, it's not just military strategy, it's also the humans involved. But maybe that's a romantic notion of war. - No, I think there's a\ngreat deal of truth in that, but let's just unpack it a bit in the case of the Soviet\nUnion in World War II, the counterargument to that\nis that in World War I, the Russian Army disintegrated. And if you look at what\nhappened when Napoleon, invaded in 1812, and you look at what happened in 1917 and then you look at what\nhappened between '41 and '45, the Napoleon case looks a\nlot like the Hitler case, and it fits neatly with your argument. But World War I does not fit\nneatly with your argument, because the Russians lost and surrendered. And you had the infamous\nTreaty of Brest-Litovsk, where the Soviet Union then, 'cause it went from\nRussia to the Soviet Union in October, 1917, the Soviet Union surrendered large amounts of Soviet territory, because it had suffered\na humiliating defeat. My argument for why the\nRussians, let me take that back, why the Soviets fought like\nwild dogs in World War II is that they were up against\nthe genocidal adversary. You wanna understand that the\nGermans murdered huge numbers of Soviet POWs. The overall total was 3.7 million. And by December of 1941, remember the invasion is June 41. By December of 1941, the Germans have murdered\n2 million Soviet POWs. At that point in time, they had murdered many more POWs than they had murdered Jews. And this is not to deny for one second that they were on a murderous\nrampage when it came to Jews, but they were also on a murderous rampage when it came to Soviet citizens\nand Soviet soldiers, right? So, those Soviet soldiers\nquickly came to understand they were fighting for their lives. If they were taken\nprisoner, they would die. So, they fought like wild dogs. - Yeah, the story of the Holocaust, of the 6 million Jews is\noften told extensively, if Hitler won, conquer the Soviet Union, it's terrifying to think\non a much grander scam than the Holocaust. What would've happened\nto the Slavic people, to the Soviet people? - Absolutely. All you have to do is read\nthe Hunger Plan, right? And they also had a\nplan, what was it called? Generalplan Ost, I forget\nthe exact name of it, which made it clear that they were gonna murder\nmany tens of millions of people. And by the way, I believe that they would've\nmurdered all the Poles and all the Roma. I mean, my view is that\nthe Jews were number one on the genocidal hit list. The Roma or the Gypsies were number two and the Poles were number three. And of course, I just explained to you how\nmany POWs they had killed. So, they would've ended\nup murdering huge numbers of Soviet citizens as well. But people quickly figured\nout that this was happening. That's my point to you. And that gave them, needless to say, very powerful incentives to\nfight hard against the Germans and to make sure that they did not win."

      "text": "- To fast forward in\ntime, but not in space. Let me ask you about the war in Ukraine. Why did Russia invade Ukraine\non February 24th, 2022? What are some of the explanations given and which do you find the most convincing? - Well, clearly the conventional\nwisdom is that Putin is principally responsible. Putin is an imperialist,\nhe's an expansionist. - That's the conventional thinking. - Yeah, yeah. And the idea is that he is bent on creating a greater Russia and even more so he's interested in dominating Eastern\nEurope, if not all of Europe. And that Ukraine was the\nfirst stop on the train line. And what he wanted to do was\nto conquer all of Ukraine incorporated into a greater Russia and then he would move on\nand conquer other countries. This is the conventional wisdom. My view is there is no evidence, let me emphasize, zero evidence\nto support that argument. - Which part that he would, the imperialist part,\nthe sense that he would, he sought to conquer all of\nUkraine and move on and conquer. - There's no evidence he was interested in conquering all of Ukraine. There's no evidence beforehand that he was interested in coning\nconquering any of Ukraine. And there's no way that an army that had 190,000 troops at the most, could have conquered all of Ukraine. Just impossible. As I like to emphasize, when the Germans went into Poland in 1939 and the Germans you wanna remember were only intent on conquering\nthe western half of Poland, because the Soviets who\ncame in later that month were gonna conquer the\neastern half of Poland. So, the western half of Poland\nis much smaller than Ukraine. And the Germans went in\nwith 1.5 million troops. If Vladimir Putin were bent\non conquering all of Ukraine, he would've needed at\nleast 2 million troops. I would argue he'd need 3 million troops, because not only did he\nneed to conquer the country, he would then have to occupy it. But the idea that 190,000\ntroops was sufficient for conquering all of Ukraine\nis not a serious argument. Furthermore, he was not\ninterested in conquering Ukraine. And that's why in March, 2022, this is immediately after the war starts, he is negotiating with\nZelensky to end the war. There are serious\nnegotiations taking place in Istanbul involving the Turks. And Naftali Bennett, who was the Israeli prime\nminister at the time, was deeply involved in negotiating with both Putin and\nZelensky to end the war. Well, if he was interested Putin in conquering all of Ukraine, why in God's name would he be negotiating with Zelensky to end the war? And of course, what they were negotiating\nabout was NATO expansion into Ukraine, which was the principle cause of the war. People in the West don't\nwant to hear that argument, because if it is true, which it is then the West\nis principally responsible for this bloodbath\nthat's now taking place. And of course, the West doesn't want to\nbe principally responsible. It wants to blame Vladimir Putin. So, we've invented this\nstory out of whole cloth, that he is an aggressor, that he's the second\ncoming of Adolf Hitler. And that what he did in Ukraine was try to conquer all of it. And he failed. But with a little bit of luck, he probably would've conquered all of it. And he'd now be in the Baltic states and eventually end up dominating\nall of Eastern Europe. As I said, I think there's\nno evidence to support this. - So, maybe there's a lot\nof things to ask there. Maybe just to linger on NATO expansion, what is NATO expansion? What is the threat of NATO expansion and why is this such a concern for Russia? - NATO was a mortal enemy\nof the Soviet Union, during the Cold War. It's a military alliance which has at its heart the\nUnited States of America, which is the most powerful\nstate on the planet. It is perfectly understandable that Russia is not going to want\nthat military alliance on its doorstep. Here in the United States we have, as you well know, what's called the Monroe Doctrine. And that basically says, no great powers from Europe or Asia are allowed to come into our neighborhood and form a military alliance with anybody in this neighborhood. When I was young, there was this thing called\nthe Cuban Missile Crisis. The Soviets had the audacity to put nuclear armed missiles in Cuba. We told them in no uncertain terms that that was not acceptable and that those missiles had to be removed. This is our backyard and we do not tolerate\ndistant great powers, coming into our neighborhood. Well, what's good for the\ngoose, it's good for the gander. And if we don't like great powers, coming into our neighborhood,\nit's hardly surprising that the Russians did not\nwant NATO on their doorstep. They made that manifestly\nclear when the Cold War ended and they exacted a promise from us that we would not expand NATO. And then when we started expanding NATO, they made it clear after\nthe first tranche in 1999 that they were profoundly\nunhappy with that. They made it clear in 2004\nafter the second tranche that they were profoundly\nunhappy with that expansion. And then in April, 2008, when NATO announced that\nUkraine and Georgia, would become part of NATO, they made it unequivocally clear, not just Putin, that was not gonna happen. They were drawing a red line in the sand. And it is no accident\nthat in August, 2008, remember the Bucharest\nSummit is April, 2008 and August, 2008, you had a\nwar between Georgia and Russia. And that involved at its\ncore in NATO expansion. So, the Americans and their\nallies should have understood by at least August, 2008, that continuing to push\nto bring Ukraine into NATO was going to lead to disaster. And I would note that there\nwere all sorts of people in the 1990s like George\nKennon, William Perry, who was Bill Clinton's\nSecretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint\nChiefs of Staff, Paul Nitsa and so forth and so on, who argued that NATO expansion, would end up producing a\ndisaster, which it has. I would note that at the famous\nApril, 2008 Bucharest Summit where NATO said that Ukraine, would be brought into the alliance, Angela Merkel and Nicholas Sarkozy, the German and French\nleaders respectively, opposed that decision. Angela Merkel later said that\nthe reason she opposed it was because she understood\nthat Putin would interpret it as a declaration of war. Just think about that. Merkel is telling you that\nshe opposed NATO expansion into Ukraine because\nshe understood correctly that Putin would see it\nas a declaration of war. What did the United States and its friends in Europe do? They continued to push and push, because we thought that we\ncould push NATO expansion, down their throat, after 2008 the same way\nwe did in 1999 and 2004. But we were wrong. And it all blew up in our face in 2014. And when it blew up in our\nface in 2014, what did we do? Did we back off and say, \"Well, maybe the Russians, \"have some legitimate security interest?\" No, that's not the way we operate. We continued to double down and the end result is that\nin 2022 you got a war. And as I've argued for a long time now, we, the West are principally\nresponsible for that, not Vladimir Putin. - So, the expansion of NATO is primarily responsible for that. - Yeah, to put it in more general terms, what we were trying to do was turn Ukraine into a Western bulwark on Russia's border. And it really wasn't NATO expansion alone. NATO expansion was the\nmost important element of our strategy. But the strategy had two other dimensions. One was EU expansion and the third was the color revolution. We were trying to force\nOrange Revolution in Ukraine. And the basic goal there was to turn Ukraine into a\npro-Western liberal democracy. And that meant that you'd\nhave Ukraine if it worked as a pro-Western liberal democracy. That was in the EU and that was in NATO. This was our goal. And the Russians made\nit unequivocally clear, Ukraine was not gonna\nbecome a Western bulwark on their border. And most importantly, they made it clear that Ukraine\nin NATO was unacceptable. - Can we talk about the\nmind of Vladimir Putin? You've mentioned that this\nidea that he has aspirations for imperialist conquest, that he dreams of empire\nis not grounded in reality. He wrote an essay in\n2021, about one people. Do you think there is some degree to which he still dreams of the former Soviet Union reuniting? - No, he's made it clear that anybody with a triple digit IQ understands that it's nuts to think about\nrecreating the Soviet Union. He thinks it's a tragedy that\nthe Soviet Union fell apart. But as he made clear in that essay, the July 12th, 2021 essay. And has he made clear in speeches before, immediately before he invaded Ukraine, he accepted the breakup\nof the Soviet Union and he accepted the status quo in Europe. Say for the fact he did not accept the idea that Ukraine\nwould become part of NATO. - He's been in power for over two decades. Is there a degree that power\ncan affect a leader's ability to see the world clearly,\nas they say corrupt? Do you think power has corrupted\nVladimir Putin to a degree? - It's very hard for me\nto answer that question, 'cause I don't know him, and I've not studied him carefully in terms of his overall performance, over the course of the 23\nyears that he's been in power, I've studied him as a strategist and I've studied how\nhe deals with the West and deals with the international\nsystem more generally, since 2014. And I think he is a\nfirst class strategist. This is not to say he\ndoesn't make mistakes and he admits he's made some mistakes. But I think that the West is dealing with a\nformidable adversary here. And I don't see any evidence that he's either lost\nspeed off his fastball or that power has corrupted his thinking, about strategic affairs. - So, he has consistently put as a primary concern security, as does the United States, he's put for Russia's security, making sure that NATO doesn't\nget close to its borders. - I think that's clear. Yeah, I think as I emphasized\nearly on in our conversation, that leaders privilege\nsecurity or survival, over everything else. And by the way, he gave a number of talks and press conferences\nin addition to writing that famous article that you\nreferred to on July 12th, 2021. So, we have a pretty clear\nrecord of what he was saying, and I would argue what he was thinking in the runup to the war in February, 2022. And if you read what he said, it's quite clear that he\nprivileged security or survival, he was deeply concerned\nabout the security of Russia. And Russia is a quite vulnerable\nstate in a lot of ways, especially if you think back to what it looked like in the 1990s, as you know better than I do, it was in terrible shape. The Chinese talk about the\nCentury of National Humiliation. One could argue that for the Russians, that was the Decade of\nNational Humiliation. And, and it took Putin, I\nthink, quite a bit of time to bring the Russians back from the dead. I think he eventually succeeded, but it took a considerable amount of time. And I think he understood that he was not playing a\nparticularly strong hand. He was playing something of a weak hand and he had to be very\ncareful, very cautious. And I think he was, and I think that's very\ndifferent than the United States. The United States was the unipole, it was the most powerful state\nin the history of the world, most powerful state relative\nto all its possible competitors from roughly 1989, certainly after December, 1991 when the Soviet Union fell apart. Up until I would argue about 2017, we were incredibly powerful. And even after 2017 up to today, the United States remains\nthe most powerful state in the system. And because of our geographical location, we are in a terrific situation to survive in any great power competition. So, you have a situation\ninvolving the United States that's different than the\nsituation involving Russia. They're just much more\nvulnerable than we are. And therefore, I think Putin tends to be\nmore sensitive about security than any American\npresident in recent times. - Europe on one side,\nChina on the other side. It's a complicated situation. - Yeah and we talked before about 1812 when Napoleon invaded and\nMoscow got burned to the ground. We talked about World War I, where the Russians were actually\ndefeated and surrendered. And then we talked about 1941 to 1945, although thankfully the Soviets prevailed, it was a close call. And I mean, the casualties, the destruction that the\nSoviet Union had inflicted on it by the Germans is\njust almost hard to believe. Just so they are sensitive, you can understand full well or at least you should be\nable to understand full well why the idea of bringing\nUkraine up to their border, really spooked them. I don't understand why more\nAmericans don't understand that. It befuddles me. I think it has to do with the fact that Americans are not very\ngood at putting themselves in the shoes of other countries. And you really, if you're gonna be a\nfirst class strategist in international politics, you have to be able to do that. You have to put yourself in\nthe shoes of the other side and think about how they think, so you don't make foolish mistakes. - And as a starting point, Americans tend to see\nthemselves as the good guys and a set of others as the bad guys. And you have to be able to empathize that Russians think of\nthemselves as the good guys. The Chinese think of\nthemselves as the good guys and just be able to empathize\nif they are the good guys. It's like that funny skit,\n\"Are We The Baddies?\" Consider the United States\ncould be the bad guys, like first of all, like see the world if the\nUnited States is the bad guys and China is the good guys,\nwhat does that world look like? Be able to just exist with that thought, because that is what\nthe Chinese leadership and many Chinese citizens, if not now, maybe in\nthe future will believe. And you have to kind\nof do the calculation, the simulation forward from that. And same with Russia, same\nwith with other nations. - Yeah, I agree with\nyou a hundred percent. And just, I always think of\nMichael McFall at Stanford, who was the American ambassador to Russia, I think between 2012 and 2014. And he told me that he told Putin that Putin didn't have to\nworry about NATO expansion, because the United States\nwas a benign hegemony. And I asked Mike what\nPutin's response was to that. And Mike said that\nPutin didn't believe it, but Mike believed that\nhe should believe it and that we could move NATO\neastward to include Ukraine and in the end we'd get away with it, because we are a benign hegemony. But the fact is, that's\nnot what Putin saw. Putin saw us as a malign hegemony. And what Mike thinks or any\nAmerican thinks, doesn't matter. What matters is what Putin thinks. - But also the drums of\nwar have been beating for some reason. NATO expansion has been\nthreatened for some reason. So, you've talked about\nNATO expansion being dead, so like it doesn't make sense from a geopolitical\nperspective on the Europe side to expand NATO, but nevertheless that\nthreat has been echoed. So, why has NATO expansion been pushed from your perspective? - There are two reasons. One is, first of all, we thought it was a wonderful thing to bring more and more\ncountries in to NATO. We thought that it facilitated\npeace and prosperity. It was ultimately all for the good. And we also thought that, countries like Ukraine\nhad a right to join NATO. These are sovereign countries\nthat can decide for themselves and the Russians have no say\nin what Ukraine wants to do. And then finally, and this is a point I emphasized before, we were very powerful and we thought we could\nshove it down their throat. So, it's a combination of those factors that led us to pursue what I think was ultimately\na foolish policy. - We've talked about how wars get started. How do you hope the war in Ukraine ends? What are the ways to end this war? What are the ways to achieve\npeace there to end the, I would say senseless death of young men as always happens in war? - I'm sad to say I don't\nhave a good answer to that. I don't think there's any real prospect of a meaningful peace agreement. I think it's almost impossible. I think the best you can\nhope for at this point is at some point in the shooting\nstops, you have ceasefire and then you have a frozen conflict. And that frozen conflict\nwill not be highly stable. And the Ukrainians in the west\nwill do everything they can to weaken Russia's position and the Russians will go to great lengths to not only damage that\ndysfunctional rum state that Ukraine becomes, but the Russians will go to great lengths to sow dissension within the alliance. And that includes in terms\nof transatlantic relations. So, you'll have this continuing\nsecurity competition, between Russia on one side and Ukraine and the West on the other. Even when you get a frozen piece and or you get a frozen conflict and the potential for\nescalation there will be great. So, I think this is a disaster. - That's a very realist perspective. Let me ask you sort of\nthe human side of it. Do you think there's some\npower to leaders sitting down, having a conversation, man to man, leader to leader about this? There's is just a lot of death happening. It seems that from a economic perspective from a historic perspective, from a human perspective\nboth nations are losing. Is it possible for Vladimir Zelensky and Vladimir Putin to sit down and talk and to figure out a way where the security concerns\nare addressed and both nations can minimize the amount of\nsuffering that's happening and create a path towards\nfuture flourishing? - I think the answer is no. - Even with United States involved, three people in the room. - Well, I think if the\nUnited States is involved, the answer's definitely no. You have to get the Americans out. And then I think if you have\nZelensky and Putin talking, you have a sliver of a chance there. The Americans are a real problem. Look, let's go back to what happens right after\nthe war starts, okay? Because I said before, we're talking March, early April of 2022. The war starts on February 24th, 2022. And as I said to you, the two sides were negotiating in Istanbul and they were also negotiating\nthrough Naftali Bennett and the Bennett track\nand the Turkish track were operating together. I mean, they were not at\ncross purposes at all. What happened? Bennett tells the story very clearly that they had made significant progress in reaching an agreement. This is Zelensky on one\nside and Putin on the other. Bennett is talking in person\nto both Putin and Zelensky and what happens to produce failure. The answer is the United\nStates and Britain get involved and tell Zelensky to walk. They tell Zelensky to walk. If they had come in\nand encouraged Zelensky to try to figure out a way with\nPutin to shut this one down and worked with Bennett\nand worked with Erdogan, we might've been able to\nshut the war down then. But it was the United States. - Well, let me sort of push back on that. You're correct, but sort of United States\npaints this like picture that everybody's aligned. So, maybe you can correct me, but I believe in the power of individuals, especially individual leaders. Again, whether it's Biden\nor Trump or whoever, goes into a room and says\nin a way that's convincing that no more NATO expansion. And actually just on a basic human level, ask the question of why are we doing all this senseless killing? And look at the interest of one Russia, look at the interest of the other Ukraine. Their interests are pretty simple. And say, United States is\ngonna stay out of this. We're not going to expand NATO and say all that in a\nway that's convincing, which is, NATO expansion\nis silly at this point. China's the big threat. We're not going to do this\nkind of conflict escalation with Russia. The Cold War's over,\nlet's normalize relations. - Well, let me just embellish\nyour argument, okay? - Thank you. - I need it. - If we say there's a sliver of a chance that you can do this, and I do think there is\na sliver of a chance. Let me just embellish your point. - [Lex] Thank you, I need\nall the help I can get. - Two things have to be\ndone here in my opinion. One is Ukraine has to become neutral and it it has to completely\nsever all security ties with the West, right? It's not like you can say\nwe're not gonna expand NATO to include Ukraine, but we're going to continue to have some loose security\narrangement with Ukraine. None of that has to be completely severed. Ukraine has to be on its own, okay? And number two, Ukraine has to accept the fact that the Russians are\ngonna keep the four oblast that they've now annexed in Crimea, right? The Russians are not gonna give them back. And what you really want\nto do if you're Zelensky or who's ever running\nUkraine in this scenario that we're positing, is you wanna make sure the Russians, don't take another four oblast to include Kyiv and Odessa, right? If I'm playing Putin's\nhand and this war goes on, I'm thinking about\ntaking four more oblast. I want to take about 43% of Ukraine and Annex to Russia, right? And I certainly want Odessa\nand I certainly want Kiev and I want the two oblast\nin between as well, right? - Literally, or as leverage in negotiation for Ukraine neutrality. - I want them literally I want\nto conquer them literally. But my point to you is if we can begin to talk\nabout cutting a deal now, you may be able to head\nthat kind of aggression off at the pass. In other words, you may be able to limit Putin and Russia to annexing the four oblasts that they've now annexed plus Crimea. That's the best I think you can hope for. But the point is you have to get the Ukrainians to accept that, you have to get the Ukrainians to accept becoming a truly neutral state and conceding that the Russians keep a big chunk of territory. It's about 23% of Ukrainian\nterritory that they've annexed. And I find it hard to imagine, any Ukrainian leader agreeing to that. - Well, there could be\nmore nuanced things like, no military involvement, between the United States and Ukraine, but economic involvement, sort of financial support, sort of normalizing economic\nrelationships with Ukraine, with Russia, all being. - I think you could\nprobably get away with that. I think that the tricky question there that you would have to answer is what about EU expansion, right? And I think EU expansion is probably a no-no for the Russians, because most people don't recognize this. But there is a military dimension\nbuilt into EU expansion. It's not purely an economic alliance or relationship or institution, whatever word you want to use. There's a military dimension to that. And in the runup to the World War, actually in the runup to the 2014 crisis, when it first broke out, the Russians made it clear\nthey saw EU expansion as a stalking horse for NATO expansion. So, EU expansion is tricky, but I think your point of close\neconomic relations between or healthy economic relations to use a better term between Ukraine and the West is possible. I think the Russians\nhave a vested interest if it's a neutral Ukraine, they have a vested interest\nin that Ukraine flourishing. But that then brings us, back to the territorial issue, right? - Well, so do you believe it's possible for individual human\nrelations to counteract the structural forces that you talk about? So, meaning the leaders being\nable to pick up the phone and make agreements that are\ngood for humanity as a whole and for their individual\nnations in the long term? - I think leadership matters here. I mean, one of the real problems here is that there's no trust\nand on the Russian side, and that has to do with\nthe Minsk Agreements. The Minsk Agreements, which were designed to\nshut down the civil war in eastern Ukraine in the Donbas, really mattered to the Russians. And there were four players\ninvolved in the Minsky process. Four main players, Russia and Ukraine of course\nand then Germany and France. And I believe the Russians took\nthe Minsk Accord seriously. I believe Putin took them very seriously. He wanted to shut down that conflict. And Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande, he was the French leader, and Poroshenko who was\nthe Ukrainian leader, those were the three key\nplayers besides Putin. Again, Hollande from\nFrance, Merkel from Germany, and Poroshenko from Ukraine\nhave all explicitly said they were not seriously interested\nin reaching an agreement in all of the discussions with Putin, they were bamboozling him. They were trying to trick him, so that they would buy time to\nbuild up Ukraine's military. Putin is profoundly upset\nabout these admissions by these three leaders. He believes he was fooled into thinking that Minsk could work. He believes that he\nnegotiated in good faith and they did not. And he believes that the level\nof trust now between Russia and the West is virtually zero as a result of this experience over Minsk. I only bring this up because\nit cuts against your argument that leaders could pick up the\nphone and talk to each other and trust each other at least somewhat to work out a meaningful deal. If you're Putin at this point in time, trusting the West is not an idea that's gonna be very attractive at all. In fact, you're gonna\ndistrust anything they say. - Yeah, distrust anything the West say. But there is individual humans. The way human nature works is when you're sitting\nacross from a person, you can trust a human being, while still distrusting the West. I mean, I believe in the power of that. I think with the right leaders, you could sit down and talk, like override the general\nstructural distrust of the West and say, you know what? I like this guy or gal, whatever. I do hope Zelensky and\nPutin sit down together and talk, have multiple talks. - Just remember they\nwere doing that in March and the Americans came in\nand the British came in. - [Lex] Yeah. - And they scotched a potential deal. - Well, the other beautiful\nthing about human nature, there's forgiveness and\nthere's trying, again, - When you're the leader of a country in an Antarctic system, you have to be very careful\nnot to let your trust in a foreign leader take you too far. Because if that foreign leader betrays you or betrays your trust and stabbed you in the\nback, you could die. And again, you wanna remember that the principal\nresponsibility of any leader, I don't care what country it is, is to ensure the survival of their state. And that means that, trust is only gonna buy you so much. And when you've already\nbetrayed the trust of a leader, you really are not gonna be\nable to rely on trust very much to help you moving forward. Now, you disagree with that? I hope you're right and if they can shut down\nthe Ukraine-Russia war, it would be wonderful. If I'm proved dead wrong,\nthat would be wonderful news. My prediction that this war is gonna go on for a long time and end in an ugly way, is a prediction that I don't like it all. So, I hope I'm wrong. - You wrote that many in the West believe that the best hope for\nending the Ukraine war is to remove Vladimir Putin from power. But you argue that this isn't the case. Can you explain? - Well, a lot of people thought when they were having all that trouble, the Russians were having all\nthat trouble with Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\nthat Putin was vulnerable and was likely to be overthrown. And what would happen is a peace-loving leader\nwould replace Putin. I made two points at the time and I would make those same two points. Now, number one, he's not likely to be overthrown. He was not likely then to be overthrown. And I think as long as\nhis health holds up, I think he will remain in power. My second point is, if he doesn't remain in\npower and he's replaced, I would bet a lot of money that his replacement will be more hawkish and more hard line than Putin is. I actually think one\ncould argue that Putin was too trusting of the\nWest before the war started. And number two, I think one could argue that he has not waged the war\nagainst Ukraine as vigorously as one might have expected. He was slow to mobilize\nthe nation for war, and he has pursued a limited war in all sorts of ways. The Israelis for example, have killed more civilians\nin Gaza in one month than the Russians have killed\nover 18 months in Ukraine. The idea that Vladimir Putin\nis waging a punishment campaign and killing on purpose, large numbers of civilians\nis simply not true. All this is to say that I would imagine that if Putin leaves office and someone else comes in to replace him, that someone else will be at least if not more hard line than\nhim, in terms of waging the war and certainly will not trust\nthe West any more than he has. - By way of advice. Let me ask you, if I were to have a conversation\ninterview Vladimir Putin and Zelensky individually, what should I ask them? If you, me and Vladimir\nPutin are having a chat, what are good ideas to explore? What are good questions to ask? What are good things to say\non or off the mic once again, that could potentially even slightly, less than the amount of\nsuffering in the world, caused by this war. - Oh, I think if you get an\ninterview with Vladimir Putin, there's just all sorts of\nquestions you could ask him. And my sense is that Putin\nis a straight shooter. He's also very knowledgeable about history and he has simple theories in his head, about how the world works. And I think he would level with you and all you would've to\ndo is just figure out what all the right questions are. And that would not be hard to do, right? You could ask him why was he so foolish? This is for example, why was he so foolish\nas to trust Poroshenko Hollande and Merkel in the Minsk accords. Why after his famous\ntalk at Munich in 2007 where he made it clear that he\nwas so unhappy with the West, did he continue to in a very\nimportant way trust the West? Why didn't he mobilize\nthe Russian military, before late September, 2022? Once the negotiations that\nwe were talking about, before involving Istanbul\nand Naftali Bennett, and once they broke down why didn't he immediately mobilize, more of the Russian\npopulation to fight the war? It just all sorts of questions like that. And then you could ask him questions about where he sees this one headed. What's the best strategy for Russia if the Ukrainians will not\nagree to neutrality, right? People like John Mearsheimer say, you'll probably take\nclose to half of Ukraine. Is that true? Does it make sense to take Odessa? - And John Mearsheimer also\nhas questions about China, your future relationships with China. - Yeah, I mean, one\nreally important question that I would ask him is if the United States had\nbasically not driven you into the arms of the Chinese, if there had been no war over Ukraine and the United States and its European allies had\ngone to considerable lengths to create some sort of\nsecurity architecture in Europe that resulted in you Vladimir Putin, having good relations with Ukraine, what would your relations with China be? And how would you think about that? So, there are just plenty of\nquestions you could ask him. - Well, hope burns eternal in my heart. I think probably in Putin's\nheart and Zelensky he's heart, I hope because hope is the leap of trust that we've talked about, I think is necessary for\ndeescalation and for peace. - Well, you realize I have\nfrom the beginning argued for different policies that were all designed to prevent this war from ever happening. - [Lex] Yes, yes. - I don't know if you know this, but in 1993, I argued\nthat Ukraine should keep its nuclear weapons. I was probably the only person in the West who made that argument. And my argument in 1993,\nthis is in foreign affairs, was that there may come the day when Russia thinks about invading Ukraine. And should that day come,\nit would be very helpful for preventing war if\nUkraine had nuclear weapons. - So, military might is essential for maintaining a balance\nof power and peace. - Well, if you're interested\nin deterring an adversary, if I'm worried about you coming after me, the best way to deter you\nis to have military might. And if you're Russia, and I'm Ukraine, I'm far weaker than you. - [Lex] Yeah, right? - And having a nuclear deterrent, would be very effective at\nconvincing you not to attack me. Because if you attack me,\nyou're threatening my survival. And that's the one circumstance where it is likely that I\nwould use nuclear weapons to defend myself. And given the consequences of nuclear use, you would be reluctant in\nthe extreme to attack me. So, that's why I argued in '93 that if Ukraine kept its nuclear weapons that made war down the\nroad much less likely. And I believe I was correct. And in fact, Bill Clinton, who played the key role in forcing Ukraine to give\nup its nuclear weapons, now says he has said it publicly, you can find it on YouTube that he made a mistake doing that. Furthermore, I argued in 2014 that it made eminently good sense, not to continue to push to\nbring Ukraine into NATO, because the end result is that\nUkraine would be destroyed and Ukraine is being destroyed. So, I was deeply interested\nat time in making sure that that didn't happen for\nthe good of the Ukrainians, not to mention, because\nstability in Europe is a net positive for\nalmost everybody involved, but people did not\nlisten to me then either. - How did nuclear weapons, change the calculus of offensive realism? Because of mutually assured destruction. I mean, it's not just military might, it's just so destructive that you basically can't\nuse nuclear weapons, unless you want complete destruction. - There's no question that the\npresence of nuclear weapons, makes it much less likely. I'm choosing my words carefully here. Much less likely that a great power, would aggress against another great power. It doesn't take that\npossibility off the table, but it makes it much less likely, because of the reasons\nthat you articulated. But with regard to nuclear use, it's an interesting question. How you think about\nnuclear use in a mad world. I mean, your point that\nwe're in a mad world is, that's mad, capital M-A-D as\nwell as M-A-D, small letters, but let's stick to the capital letters. We're in a world of mutual\nassured destruction. There's no question that in that world, it's unlikely that nuclear\nweapons would be used. But the way you use nuclear\nweapons in that world is you use them for\nmanipulation of risk purposes, demonstration effect. You put both sides out\non the slippery slope. Now, what exactly am I saying here? Let me talk about NATO doctrine. During the Cold War, we lived in a mad world, United States and Soviet Union, or the Warsaw Pact in NATO, both had an assured\ndestruction capability. So, you had mutual assured destruction. If the Warsaw Pact were\nto invade western Europe and here we're talking about West Germany and NATO was losing the war, we said that we would use nuclear weapons. How would we use nuclear weapons, given that we were in a mad world? The argument was that\nwe would use a handful of nuclear weapons\nagainst the Warsaw Pact, not necessarily against\ntheir military forces, could be in a remote area. We would use a small\nnumber of nuclear weapons to signal to the Soviets\nthat we were deadly serious, about putting an end to their offensive. And that we were throwing both sides, out on the slippery slope to oblivion. In other words, we were manipulating risk. And the last clear chance\nto avoid Armageddon, rested with them. And then we would tell\nthem that if you retaliated with a handful of nuclear weapons and you didn't cease your\noffensive against West Germany, we would launch a small\nanother nuclear attack. We would explode a handful\nmore of nuclear weapons, all for the purposes of\nshowing you our resolve, right? So, this is the manipulation\nof risk strategy and a lot of the language I just used in describing it to you is language that Thomas Schelling invented, right? Now, fast forward to the present, if Russia were losing in Ukraine, that's the one scenario where I think where Russia would've\nused nuclear weapons. And the question is, how would Russia have\nused nuclear weapons? Again, we're assuming that the Russians are losing to the Ukrainians. I believe they would've pursued a manipulation risk strategy. They would've used four or\nfive, three or four, who knows? Nuclear weapons. - Maybe just one in a rural\narea that kills very few people. - Yes, exactly. And basically that would spook everybody. The American- - Just the mushroom cloud. - Yeah. It's because of the threat of escalation. Again, you your point\nis we're in a mad world. I accept that. And if you have limited\nnuclear use, right? We understand hardly anything\nabout nuclear escalation, because thank goodness we've\nnever had a nuclear war. So, once you throw both sides\nout on the slippery slope, even if you only use one\nnuclear weapon in your scenario, you don't know what the\nescalation dynamics look like. So, everybody has a powerful incentive to put an end to the conflict right away. I might add to you that there were people who believed that we\nwould not even initiate a manipulation of risk strategy in Europe if we were losing to the Warsaw\nPact during the Cold War. Both Henry Kissinger and Robert McNamara said\nafter leaving office, that they would not have done it. They would've not initiated nuclear use, even limited nuclear use. That's what we're talking about here. They would rather be red than dead, right? That was the argument. - [Lex] Too risky. - Too risky, that's exactly right. But if they had used one\nnuclear weapon in your story or three or four in my story, everybody would've said, \"Oh my God, we've got to shut\nthis one down immediately.\" I only tell you this story\nor lay out this scenario as an answer to your question\nof how you use nuclear weapons in a mad world. And this is the answer - This is all very terrifying. Perhaps in part, it's terrifying to me, because I can see in the\n21st century China, Russia, Israel, United States using\na nuclear weapon in this way, blowing it up somewhere\nin the middle of nowhere that kills maybe nobody. But I'm terrified of\nseeing the mushroom cloud and not knowing what given social media, given how fast news travels, what the escalation looks like there. Just in a matter of minutes\nhow the news travels and how the leaders react, it's terrifying that this\nlittle demonstration of power, the ripple effects of it in\na matter of minutes, seconds, what that leads to, because it's like, it's human emotions. It's like you see the\nlandscape of human emotions, the leaders and the populace and the way news are reported, and then the landscape of\nrisk, as you mentioned, shifting like the world's most intense, non-linear dynamical system. And it is just terrifying, 'cause the entirety of\nhuman civilizations hangs in the balance there. And it's like this, like hundreds of millions\nof people could be dead. - Let's just talk about\nthis in the context of the Ukraine war. If the Russians were\nlosing as I said before, which is not the case anymore, but in 2022, it did look like that. If the Russians are losing and\nthey turn to nuclear weapons, the question is how do they use them? And they would use them in Ukraine. And because Ukraine has no\nnuclear weapons of its own, Ukraine cannot retaliate. It's not a mutual assured\ndestruction world. It's a case where one\nside has nuclear weapons and the other doesn't. That means that the Russians are likely to think that they can get away with using nuclear weapons in ways that would not be the case if they were attacking NATO. And therefore it makes\nnuclear use more likely. Okay that's point one. Point two is let's assume\nthat the Russians use two or three nuclear weapons in a remote area. - My paws are sweating, by the way, just as a commentary, it's terrifying. - Yeah, the question then\nis what does the West do? Now, Macron has said and Biden has also, I think implicitly made this clear, we would not retaliate\nwith nuclear weapons if the Russians were to attack with a handful of nuclear\nweapons in Western Ukraine. But then the question\nis, what would we do? And if you listen to David Petraeus, what David Petraeus says\nis that we should attack the Russian naval assets in the Black Sea and attack Russian forces in Ukraine. Well, once you do that,\nyou have a great power war. You have NATO versus Russia, which is another way of saying you have the United States versus Russia. We're now in a great power war. They have nuclear weapons,\nwe have nuclear weapons. They've used nuclear weapons. What is the happy ending here? And just to take it a step further and go back to our earlier discussion, about moving NATO up to Russia's borders. The point I made, which you surely agree with, is that the Russians are very fearful when they see NATO coming\nup to their border. Well, here's a case where not only is NATO come up to their border, but they're in a war with\nNATO right on their border. What do the escalation\ndynamics look like there? You know what the answer is? Who knows? That should scare the live-in\nbejesus out of you, right? - And some of it could be,\nlike you mentioned, unintended. That could be unintended consequences, that could be a Russian\nmissile misses and hits Poland, these kinds of things that just\nescalate misunderstandings, miscommunications, even I mean, nuclear weapon could be, boy, it could have been\nplanned to go location X and it went to a location Y that ended up actually killing a very large number of people. I mean, just that the\nescalation that happens there, just happens in a matter of minutes. And the only way to stop that is communication between leaders. And that to me is a big argument\nfor ongoing communication. - There's a story that during\nthe Cuban missile crisis, Kennedy put out the word no\naircraft under any circumstances are to penetrate Soviet airspace. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - And he then found out a few days later that some guy hadn't gotten the message and had penetrated in an aircraft\ndeep into Soviet airspace. And this supports your basic\npoint that bad things happen. And again the overarching point here is we've never done\nthis before, thankfully, therefore, we don't\nhave a lot of experience as to how it plays itself out. It's really a theoretical enterprise, because there's no empirical basis for talking about escalation\nin a nuclear crisis. And that of course is a wonderful thing. - Well, and in general the\nhuman species as a whole is a one-off is a theoretical enterprise. The survival of the human species, we've seen empires rise and fall, but we haven't seen the\nhuman species rise and fall. So, far it's been rising, but it's not obvious that it doesn't end. In fact, I think about aliens a lot. And the fact that we don't\nsee aliens makes me suspect it's not so easy to survive in this complicated world of ours."

      "section": "Israel and Palestine",
      "text": "Switching gears a little bit and going to a different\npart of the world, also engulfed in war. Let me ask you about\nthe situation in Israel. Why did Hamas attack Israel\non October 7th, 2023? As you understand the situation, what was the reason that attack happened? - Well, I think the main reason was that you had this\nsuffocating occupation. I think as long as the\noccupation persists, the Palestinians are going to resist. As you well know, this\nis not the first time there has been a Palestinian uprising. There was the First Intifada,\nthere was the Second Intifada, now there's October 7th, and their uprisings besides those three, so this is not terribly surprising, a lot of people hypothesized\nthat this attack was due to the fact that the Israelis, the Saudis and the Americans\nwere working together to foster another Abraham Accord, and that the Palestinians would in effect be sold down the river. I think given the fact that\nthis was in the planning stages for probably about two years, and the Abraham Accords\nwith regard to Saudi Arabia are relatively new phenomenon, I don't think that's the\nmain driving force here. I think the main driving force is that the Palestinians\nfeel oppressed as they should and that this was a resistance move. They were resisting\nthe Israeli occupation. - So, that resistance, the attack involved killing a large number of Israeli civilians. There's many questions to ask there, but one is do you think\nHamas fully understood what the retaliation will\ninvolve from Israel into Gaza? - They had to understand. I mean, you had Operation\nCast Lead in 2008, 2009. It started, I think right\nafter Christmas 2008. And it ended right before\nPresident Obama took office in January, 2009. And the Israelis periodically do what they call mowing the lawn, where they go into Gaza and they pound the\nPalestinians to remind them that they're not supposed to\nrise up and cause any problem. So, there's no question in my mind that the Hamas forces understood full well that the Israelis would retaliate\nand they would retaliate in force as they have done. - Yeah, even the metaphor\nof mowing the lawn is disturbing to me in many ways. I actually saw Norman\nFinkelstein, I think, say that, well then if\nyou use that metaphor, then you could say that Hamas\nwas also mowing the lawn. And it's such a horrific image, because the result on either side is just the death of civilians. I mean, let me ask you about\nthe death of civilians. So, during the attack,\n1400 Israelis were killed. Over 240 were taken hostage. And then in response, as we sit today, Israel's military response has killed over 10,000 people in Gaza. And given the nature of the demographics, it's a very heavily young population. Over 40% of them are under\nthe age of 18 of those killed. That's of course, according to Ministry of Health\nof Palestinian Authority. So, what do you think\nis the long-term effect on the prospect of peace\nwhen so many civilians die? - I mean, I think it's disastrous. I mean, the only way\nyou're gonna get peace here is if you have a two-state solution where the Palestinians have a\nsovereign state of their own and there is a sovereign Jewish state. And these two states live side by side, American presidents since Jimmy Carter, have understood this full well. And this is why we have pushed very hard for two-state solution. Indeed, many American Jews and many Israelis have pushed\nfor a two-state solution, because they think that that\nis the only way you're going to get peace between the two sides. But what's happened here\nis that in recent years, the Israelis have lost all\ninterest in a two-state solution. And it's in large part\nbecause the political center of gravity in Israel has\nsteadily moved to the right. When I was a young boy, the political center of gravity in Israel was much further to the\nleft than it is today. And it is in a position now\nthe political center of gravity where there's hardly any\nsupport for two-state solution and Netanyahu and the rest of\nthe people in his government were in favor or are in\nfavor of a greater Israel. There's just no question about that. Well, on top of that, you now have had a war\nwhere, as you described, huge numbers of civilians have been killed and you already had bad blood\nbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis before this conflict. And you could imagine how people on each side now feel about\npeople on the other side. So, even if you didn't have\nthis opposition inside Israel to a two-state solution, how could you possibly get the Israelis now to agree to a two-state solution? I think for the foreseeable future, the animosity inside Israel\ntowards the Palestinians is so great that it is\nimpossible to move the Israelis in that direction. And the Israelis here\nare the key players more, so than the Palestinians, because it's the Israelis\nwho control greater Israel. It's the Israelis who\nyou have to convince. Now, I wanna be clear here, you also ultimately have\nto get around the fact that Hamas is not committed\nto a two-state solution. But I think that problem\ncould be dealt with. It's important to understand that Arafat and the PLO was once adamantly opposed to a two-state solution, but Arafat came around to understand that that was really the\nonly hope for settling this. And he became a proponent\nof a two-state solution. And that's true of Mahmoud Abbas who runs the PA in the West Bank. It's not true of Hamas\nat this point in time. They want a one -state solution, they want a Palestinian state. And of course, the Israelis want a\none state solution too, which is a Jewish state that controls all of\nall of greater Israel. So the question is, can you\nget some sort of agreement? And I think to get to your, the number of your question,\ngiven what's just happened, it's almost impossible to imagine that happening anytime soon. - The cynical perspective here is that those in power\nbenefit from conflict, while the people on both sides suffer. Is there degree of truth to that? Or for the people in\npower to maintain power, conflict needs to continue. - No, I don't believe that. I mean, just to take\nthe Netanyahu government or any Israeli Government\nthat maintains the occupation, what you want is you want\na Palestinian population that submits to Israeli\ndomination of Greater Israel. You don't want resistance. You don't want an Intifada, you don't want what\nhappened on October 7th. In fact, I think one of\nthe principle reasons that the Israelis are pounding Gaza and killing huge numbers of civilians, punishing the civilian population in ways that clearly\nviolate the laws of war, is because they want the Palestinians to understand that they\nare not allowed to rise up and resist the occupation. That's their goal. So, I think the Israelis would prefer that the Palestinians roll\nover and accept submission. In terms of the people who live in Gaza, to include the elites and the people who live in the West Bank to include the elites. They would much prefer to\nmove to some sort of situation where the Palestinians\nhave a state of their own. I think in the case of the PA under Abbas, they would accept the two-state solution. I think what at this\npoint in time Hamas wants is a one-state solution,\nbut they want peace. All of them want peace. The two different sets of\nleadership in Palestine and the Israelis. - So, you think Hamas wants peace? - Sure. But on its own terms, that's the point. - What does peace look like for Hamas? - At this point in time, I think peace basically\nmeans a greater Israel, controlled by Palestine or Palestinians. - Okay, so essentially, I mean the whole land is called Palestine and there's no Israel. - I think at this point in time\nthat's their principle goal. I do believe and there\nhave been hints over time, Jimmy Carter has said this, that Hamas can be convinced\nthat a two-state solution, assuming that the Palestinians\nget a viable state of their own, that Hamas\nwould buy into that. Can we say that with a\nhigh degree of certainty? No, but I think the\nIsraelis should have pursued that possibility. They should have worked with Abbas. They should have worked with Hamas to do everything they can to facilitate a two-state solution. Because I think ultimately\nthat's an Israel's interest. Now, the Israeli government and most Israelis at this point in time, I believe, don't agree with that. - What do you think of Israel starting the ground invasion of Gaza\nrecently on October 27th? - The question is, should they continue until they\nhave finally defeated Hamas? There are all sorts of\nreports in the media, including in the Israeli media, that they're not gonna be allowed by the United States to\ncontinue this offensive from much more than a few weeks. The Israelis have been saying it would, it's gonna take in the best\nof all possible worlds, a number of months if not\na year to finish off Hamas. Well, it doesn't look like they're gonna have enough time to do that. I doubt whether they can finish off Hamas, even if they're given the time. I think they're gonna run\ninto fierce resistance. And when they run into fierce resistance and large numbers of\nIsraelis gonna start to die, they'll lose their appetite for this. And they, the Israelis\nsurely know at this point in time that even if\nthey finish off Hamas, even if I'm wrong and they're\nable to finish off Hamas, another group is gonna rise\nup to resist the occupation. The idea that you can use\nwhat Ze'ev Jabotinsky, called the Iron Wall to\nbeat the Palestinians into submission is delusional. It's just not gonna happen. The Palestinians want\na state of their own. They don't wanna live under occupation. And there's no military\nsolution for Israel here. There has to be a political solution. And the only viable political solution is a two-state solution. I mean, you can't go to democracy. You can't go to a situation where you give the\nPalestinians equal rights, inside a greater Israel in large part, because there are now as many Palestinians as there are Israeli Jews. And over time the balance, the demographic balance shifts\nagainst the Israeli Jews and in favor of the Palestinians, in which case you'll end up with a Palestinian\nstate in greater Israel. So, democracy for all doesn't work. The Israelis, I believe are quite interested\nin ethnic cleansing. I think they saw this recent set of events as an opportunity to cleanse Gaza. But that's not gonna happen. The Jordanians and the\nEgyptians have made it clear that that's not happening. The United States is now made it clear that that's not happening. And the Palestinians will not leave. They'll die in place. So, ethnic cleansing doesn't work. So, you're really left\nwith two alternatives, a two-state solution or a greater Israel that is\neffectively an apartheid state. I mean, that's what the\noccupation has led to. And all sorts of people\nhave been predicting this for a long, long time. And you've now reached the point, here in the United States, if you say that Israel's\nan apartheid state, that's gonna get you into\nall sorts of trouble. But the fact is that human rights watch, Amnesty International and B'Tselem which is the leading\nIsraeli human rights group, all three of those institutions or organizations have\nissued detailed reports,, making the case that Israel\nis an apartheid state. Furthermore, if you\nread the Israeli media, all sorts of Israelis,\nincluding Israeli leaders, refer to Israel as an apartheid state. It's not that unusual to hear\nthat term used in Israel. This is disastrous for\nIsrael in my opinion. And Steve Walt and I said this by the way, when we wrote \"The Israel Lobby\", that Israel is an apartheid state, which is equivalent to\nIsrael as an occupier is not good for Israel. And that brings us back\nto the two-state solution, but is you and I were talking\nabout a few minutes ago, it's hard to see how you\nget a two-state solution. And the end result of this\nconversation is utter despair. - Because the path to a\ntwo-state solution is blocked by the amount of hate that's\ncreated by civilian deaths. - Well, that plus the fact\nthat the Israeli government is filled with people who have no interest in\na two-state solution. They're ideologically deeply\ncommitted to a greater Israel. They want all the land\nbetween the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea to\nbe part of a Jewish state. They're just ideologically\ncommitted to that. And of course, as we were\ntalking about before, with regard to Hamas, Hamas wants everything\nbetween the river and the sea to be a Palestinian state. And when you have two sides with those kinds of views, right? You are in deep trouble, because there's little\nroom for compromise. So, what you have to\ndo to get this to work is you have to convince the Israelis that it's in their interest\nto have a two-state solution. And you've already taken\ncare of the PA on this front, the Palestinian Authority, but you've gotta convince Hamas that its Maximalist goals\nare are not gonna work in its interest to follow\nin the footsteps of Arafat and accept a two-state solution. But even if you do that at this point, let's say that there's a lot\nof willingness intellectually on both sides to do that. The problem is that the\nhatred that has been fueled by this recent ongoing conflict, is so great that it's just hard to imagine how you can make a two-state\nsolution work at this juncture. That's why I've sort of taken to saying and I hope I'm wrong here, that on the two-state\nsolution that boat has sailed. It's just it's no longer possible. - Well, again, I believe in leadership and there's other parties at play here, other nations, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, other players in the\nMiddle East that can help, that can help through a\nnormalization of relationships and these kinds of things. There's always hope, like you said, slither of hope. - [John] Slither of hope. - I think human civilization\nprogresses forward by taking advantage of the\nall the slithers it can get. Let me ask you about, you\nmentioned \"The Israel Lobby\". You wrote a book, probably your most\ncontroversial book on the topic, - Not probably, clearly the most controversial\nbook I ever wrote. - So you've criticized Israel\nlobby in the United States for influencing US policy\nin the Middle East. Can you explain what\n\"The Israel Lobby\" is, their influence and your\ncriticism over the past, let's say a couple decades? - Well, the argument that\nSteve Walt and I made, actually, we wrote an article first and which appeared in the\n\"London Review of Books,\" and then we wrote the book itself. Our argument is that the lobby is a loose coalition of\nindividuals and organizations that push American policy\nin a pro-Israel direction. And basically, the lobby is\ninterested in getting Israel, excuse me, getting the United States. And here we're talking mainly\nabout the American Government to support Israel no\nmatter what Israel does. And our argument is that if\nyou look at the relationship, between the United States and Israel, it's unprecedented in modern history. This is the closest relationship that you can find\nbetween any two countries in recorded history. It's truly amazing the\nextent to which Israel and the United States\nare joined at the hip. And we support Israel no matter what, almost all the time. And our argument is\nthat that is largely due to the influence of the lobby. The lobby is an extremely\npowerful interest group. Now, it's very important to understand that the American political system is set up in ways that\nallow interest groups of all sorts to wield great influence. So, in the United States, you have an interest group or a lobby, like the National Rifle\nAssociation that makes it, well, not impossible to get gun control. Yeah, right. And so with \"The Israel Lobby,\" you have this group of\nindividuals and organizations that wield enormous\ninfluence on US policy, toward the Middle East. And this is not surprising given the nature of the\nAmerican political system. So, our argument is that the lobby is not doing anything\nthat's illegal or elicit or immoral or unethical. It's just a good old fashioned\nAmerican interest group. And it just happens to\nbe extremely powerful. And our argument is that this is not good for the United States, because no two countries\nhave the same interests, all the time. And when our interests conflict\nwith Israel's interests, we should be able to do what we think is in our national interest,\nin America's national interest. But the lobby tends to conflate\nAmerica's national interest with Israel's national interest and wants the United\nStates to support Israel, no matter what. We also argue, and I cannot emphasize this enough, given what's going on in the world today, that the lobby's effects, the lobby has not been pushing policies that are in Israel's interest. So, our argument is that\nthe lobby pushes policies that are not in America's interest or not in Israel's interest. Now, you're saying to yourself, what exactly does he mean by that? What every president since\nJimmy Carter has tried to do, as I said before, is to foster a two-state\nsolution to push Israel, which is the dominant\nplayer in Greater Israel, push Israel to accept\nthe two-state solution. And we have run into huge resistance from the lobby whenever we tried to, let's be blunt about it,\ncoerce Israel, right? In a perfect world\nwhere there was no lobby and an American president was free to put pressure on Israel, to coerce Israel, I believe we would've gone a long way, towards getting two-state solution. And I believe this would've\nbeen in Israel's interest, but we couldn't get a two-state solution, because it was almost impossible to put meaningful pressure on\nIsrael because of the lobby. So, this was not in Israel's interest and it was not in America's interest. And that was the argument that we made. And we of course got huge\npushback for making that argument. - What's the underlying\nmotivation of the lobby? Is it religious in nature? Is it similar to the way war hawks are, sort of militaristic in nature? Is it nationalistic in nature? If you were de describe\nthis coalition of people, what would you say is their motivation? - Well, first of all, I think you have to distinguish\nbetween Jews and Christians. You wanna remember that there are a huge number\nof Christians Zionists, who are deeply committed to\nIsrael no matter what, right? And then there are a large number of Jews. The Jews are obviously the most important of those two groups in \"The Israel Lobby\". But one of the arguments\nthat we made in the book is that you should not\ncall it the Jewish lobby, because it's not populated just by Jews. And Christians Zionists are an\nimportant part of that lobby. But furthermore, there are a good number of Jews\nwho are opposed to the lobby and the policies that the lobby prevails. And there a number of Jews who are prominent anti-Zionists, right? So, and they're obviously not in the lobby or if you take a group like\nJewish Voice for Peace, right? Jewish Voice for Peace\nis not in the lobby. So, it's wrong to call it a Jewish lobby. But with regard to the American\nJews who were in that lobby, I think that really, this\nis all about nationalism. It's not so much religion. Many of those Jews who are influential in the lobby are not religious in any meaningful sense of that term, but they self-identify as Jewish in the sense that they feel\nthey're part of a Jewish nation. And that in addition to being an American, they are part of this tribe,\nthis nation called Jews and that they have a responsibility to push the United States in ways that support the Jewish state. So, I think that's what drives most, if not almost all the Jews. This is not to say there's\nnot a religious dimension for some of them, but I think that the main connection is much more tribal in nature. - So, I had a conversation\nwith Benjamin Netanyahu and he said, fundamentally,\nif you're anti-Zionist, you're anti-Semitic. So, the Zionist project\nis tied to the hip, to the Jewish project. What do you have to say to that? - Look, you can define anti-Semitism, any way you want, right? And you can define anti-Semitism to incorporate anti-Zionism. And I think we have reached\nthe point where antisemitism is identified today, not\njust with anti-Zionism, but with criticism of Israel. If you criticize Israel, people will say some people will say, you're an antisemite and if that's your\ndefinition of antisemitism, it's taken an important term and stretched it to the point\nwhere it's meaningless, right? So, when Steve and I wrote the book, wrote the article and then wrote the book, all sorts of people said\nthat we were anti-Semite, this is a ludicrous charge. But what they meant was, you're criticizing the lobby, you're criticizing Israel, and therefore you're an antisemite. Okay if that's what an antisemite is, somebody who criticizes Israel, probably half the Jewish community, if not more in the United\nStates is antisemitic. And of course, you get\ninto all these crazy games where people are calling\nJews, self-hating Jews, and anti-Semites because\nthey're critical of Israel. But even people who are anti-Zionists, I don't think they're anti-Semitic at all. You can argue they're\nmisguided, that's fine. But many of these people are Jewish and proud of the fact that they're Jewish. They just don't believe that nationalism and Jewish nationalism is a\nforce that should be applauded. And you wanna understand\nthat in the American context, there is a rich tradition\nof anti-Zionism, right? And these were not people\nwho were anti-Semites, if you go back to the 30s, 40s, 50s. And the same thing was\neven true in Europe. There were all sorts of European Jews who were opposed to Zionism. Were they anti-Semite? I don't think so, but we've gotten to the point now where people are so interested in stopping any criticism of Israel that they wield this weapon\nof calling people anti-Semite, so loosely that the term\nhas kinda lost meaning. So, I think Netanyahu is wrongheaded to equate anti-Zionism with antisemitism. - Alan Dershowitz was one of the people that called you specifically antisemitic. So, just looking at\nthe space of discourse, how do you, where's the slither of\nhope for healthy discourse, about US relationships with Israel, between you and Alan\nDershowitz and others like him? - Well, I think until there is a settlement of the\nIsraeli Palestinian conflict, there's no hope of putting an\nend to this nonsense, right? - So, these are just uses of terms to kinda cheat your way\nthrough the discourse. It's shortcut. - No, it's to silence people, right? So, it's very, very important to understand that one of\nthe lobby's principle goals is to make sure we don't\nhave an open discourse, a freewheeling discourse about Israel, because they understand\npeople in the lobby understand that if you have an open discourse, Israel will end up\nlooking very bad, right? You don't wanna talk about the occupation, you don't wanna talk about\nhow Israel was created, right? All these subjects are ones that will cause problems for Israel. See, just to go to the\npresent crisis, okay? When you have a disaster and what happened on\nOctober 7th is a disaster, one of the first things that happens is that people begin to ask the question, how did this happen, right? What's the root cause of this problem? This is a disaster. We have to understand what caused it, so that we can work to make\nsure it doesn't happen again, so we can work to shut it down and then make sure it\ndoesn't happen again. But once you start talking\nabout the root causes, right? You end up talking about how\nIsrael was created, right? And that means telling a\nstory that is not pretty, about how the Zionists\nconquered Palestine. And number two, it means talking about\nthe occupation, right? It's not like Hamas\nattacked on October 7th, because there were just\na bunch of anti-Semite who hated Jews and wanted to kill Jews. This is not Nazi Germany, right? This is directly related to the occupation and to what was going on inside of Gaza. And it's not in Israel's interest or the lobby's interest\nto have an open discourse, about what the Israelis have\nbeen doing to the Palestinians, since I would say roughly 1903 when the Second Aliyah came to Israel or came to what was then Palestine, right? We wanna talk about that. And we don't want to talk about from the lobbyist's point of view, the influence that the lobby has, right? It's better from the\nlobbyist's point of view, if most Americans think that\nAmericans support of Israel is just done for all the right\nmoral and strategic reasons, not because of the lobby. And when John Mearsheimer and\nSteve Walt come along and say, you have to understand that\nthis special relationship is due in large part to\nthe lobby's influence, that is not an argument that people in the lobby want to hear. So, the point is, you have to go to great\nlengths for all these reasons. You have to go to great lengths\nto silence people like me and Steve Walt. And one of the ways to do that\nis to call us anti-Semite. I think the chapter or\nthe section of the book where we talk about this charge of antisemitism is called\n\"The Great Silencer.\" That's what we call the\ncharge of antisemitism, the great silencer. Who wants to be called an antisemite, especially in the wake of the Holocaust? Do I wanna be called an antisemite? Oh my God, no. And so it's very effective, but it is important to\ntalk about these issues in my humble opinion. And I think if we had\ntalked about these issues, way back when, it would've\ngone a long way towards, maybe getting a two-state solution, which I think was the\nbest alternative here. - It it's complicated. And I wonder if you can comment\non the complexity of this, because criticizing Israel and criticizing the lobby can for a lot of people be a dog whistle for sort of anti-Semitic\nconspiracy theories that this idea that Jews run everything, run the world or this kind of cabal. And it's also very true that people who are\nlegitimately anti-Semitic are also critics of Israel\nin the same kind of way. And so it's such a\ncomplicated landscaping. We should have discussions because, even people like David Duke who are racist don't sound\nracist on the surface. I haven't listened to 'em enough, but like there's dog whistles. It's a complicated space in\nwhich to have discussions, because I mean, I wonder if\nyou can sort of speak to that, because there's this silencing effect of calling everybody anti-Semitic. But it's also true that there\nis anti-Semitism in the world. Like there is the sizeable\npopulation of people that hate Jews. There's probably a sizeable\npopulation of people who hate Muslims too. - [John] A lot of hate out there. - A lot of hate out there. But the hatred of Jews\nhas like a long history. And so you have like rolling Stones, have a set of great hits and there's just a set of great hits of the ways conspiracy theories that you can make about the Jews that are used as part of the hatred. So, there's like nice templates for that. And I just wonder if you can comment on operating as a\nhistorian, as an analyst, as a strategic thinker\nin this kind of space. - Yeah, we obviously, when we wrote the article, which we did before the book, gave this subject a great deal of thought. I mean, what you say just\nnow is music to our ears and I'm talking about me and Steve. I mean, I think that your point about dog whistles is correct. Look, we went to great\nlengths to make it clear that this is not a cabal,\nit's not a conspiracy. And in fact, in a very important way, the lobby operates out in the open, right? They brag about their power, right? And this was true before we\nwrote the article, right? And we said in the article and the book and you heard me say\nit here, first of all, it's not a Jewish lobby, right? Secondly, it's not a cabal, right? It's an American interest group. - And the American system is designed, such that interest groups\nare perfectly legal and some of them are super effective. - Exactly. I mean, you hit the\nnail right on the head. That's exactly right. And there was nothing that we\nsaid that was anti-Semitic, by any reasonable definition of that term. And huge numbers of Jews have known me and Steve over the years, and nobody ever, ever said\nthat we were anti-Semitic, before March, 2006 when\nthe article appeared, because we're not antisemitic. But look, you've got this\ninterest group, right? That has a significant\ninfluence on American policy and on Israeli policy and you wanna talk about it. It's just important to talk about it. It's important for Jews, right? In the United States, for Jews\nin Israel to talk about this. The idea that you wanna silence critics, is not a smart way to\ngo about doing business, in my opinion. If we were wrong, if Steve and I were so wrong\nand our arguments were so foul, they could have easily\nexposed those arguments. They could have gone into combat with this in terms of\nthe marketplace of ideas and easily knocked this down. The problem was that our\narguments were quite powerful. And instead of engaging us\nand defeating our arguments, they wanted to silence us. And this is not good, right? It's not good for Israel, it's not good for the United States. And I would argue in the end, if anything it's gonna\nfoster antisemitism. I think you don't wanna\nrun around telling people that they can't talk about Israel, without being called an antisemite. It's just not, it's not healthy in terms of the issue that you're raising, right? But I still agree with you\nthat it is a tricky issue. I don't wanna make light of that. I know that there's this\npiece of literature out there, called the \"Protocols\nof the Elders of Zion,\" and I fully understand\nthat if you're not careful, you can come close to writing\nvolume two of the protocol. But I don't believe that we wrote anything that was even close to that. And again, I think that a\nhealthy debate on the issues that we were raising would've been, not only in America's interest, but it would've been in Israel's interest. - Yeah, I mean, underneath it all is just, I wonder why there's so\nmuch hate against groups, why it's such a sticky way of thinking, not just tribalism, like\nproud of your country and kind of hating another country, but really deeply hating, like hating in a way where it's part of your\nidentity kind of hate. - Well, just to make a\ngeneral point on this issue in our conversation here today, you often talk about individual leaders and the word individual often\npops up in your vocabulary. - [Lex] Yes. - I believe that we are\nultimately social animals, before we are individuals. I believe we're born into tribes, we're heavily socialized and that we carve out space\nfor our individualism. But we are part of tribes and\nor social groups or nations, call them what you want, ethnic groups, religious groups. But the fact is that these tribes, often crash into each other, and when they crash into each other, they end up hating each other. If you go to a place like Bosnia, right? The Croats and the Serbs, oh my God. And then throw in the Bosniaks or which is the term for Bosnian Muslims, and Muslims, Croats, Serbs, oh, and the tribes hate each other. And in a funny way, that\nhatred almost never goes away. And I guess there are\nsome exceptions to that. If you look at the Germans\nafter World War II, they've gone a long way towards reducing, I wouldn't wanna say\ncompletely eliminating, but reducing a lot of the hatred that existed between\nGermans and their neighbors. But that's really kind\nof an anomalous case. I mean, you go around East Asia today and the hatred of Japan\nin a place like China, the hatred of Japan in a place like Korea, just not to be underestimated. And so but I think a\nlot of it just has to do with the fact that you're\ndealing with social groups that have crashed into each\nother at one point or another. And there are those lingering effects. And by the way, this gets back to our\ndiscussion a few minutes ago, about trying to get a two-state solution, between the Palestinians\nand the Israeli Jews. Now, that you have had this horrible war, which is ongoing. - It's interesting to ask,\nto go back to World War II. Now, you said you studied\nNazi Germany in the '30s from a perspective of\nmaybe offensive realism, but just to look at the Holocaust, it's sometimes popular\nin public discourse today to compare certain\nthings to the Holocaust. People have compared the\nHamas attack on Israel to the Holocaust saying things like, it's the biggest attack on\nJews since the Holocaust, which kind of implies\nthat there's a comparison. People have made that same comparison in the other direction. What do you make of this comparison? Is it comparable? Is the use of the Holocaust, have any accuracy in comparisons of modern day international politics? - Is it possible that you\ncould have another genocide? Yes. And I would argue that\nwhat you had in Rwanda was a genocide, right? The Holocaust is not the only genocide. I believe the word genocide\nis used too loosely today. And as lots of people\nand I mean lots of people who are pro-Palestinian accused\nthe Israelis of engaging in genocide in Gaza. I think what the Israelis\nare doing in Gaza, represents a massacre. I would use that term given\nthe number of civilians that they've killed and the fact that they've\nbeen indiscriminate in terms of how they've been bombing Gaza. But I would not use the word genocide. For me, a genocide is\nwhere one side attempts to eliminate another\ngroup from the planet. I think that what happened\nwith the Holocaust was clearly a genocide and that the Germans\nwere bent on destroying, all of European Jewry. And if they could have gotten their hands on Jews outside of Europe, they would've murdered them as well. That's a genocide. And I think with the\nHutu's and the Tootsies, you had a similar situation. I think with the Turks and the\nArmenians during World War I. That was a genocide, but I have a rather narrow\ndefinition of what a genocide is. And I don't think there are many cases that qualify as a genocide. The Holocaust certainly does, okay? Now, what Hamas did\ndoesn't even come close to what happened to European Jewry, between, let's say 1939 and 1945, although I date the start\nof the Holocaust in 1941, if we were looking at it closely, but let's just say 1939,\nwhen they invade Poland. From 1939 to 1945, what Hamas did parallels in comparison. It's hard to believe anybody would make that argument, right? Yes, a lot of Jews died, but hardly any compared\nto the number that died at the hands of the Germans. I mean, it just no parallel at all. And furthermore, Hamas was in no position\nto kill all the Jews in the Middle East. Just not gonna happen. - Yeah, but there's also\na lot levels of things, using Germans using human skin for lamps. There's just levels of evil in this world. - Yes, but you don't see that with, I mean, that's not what Hamas is doing. No, I mean, I wanna be very clear here. I am not justifying Hamas'\nkilling of civilians, okay? Not for one second, but I'm just saying and by the way, just to go to the Israelis and what they're doing in Gaza, right, is I said to you before, I do believe that is a massacre, and I believe that's to be condemned, the killing of civilians. This is not legitimate collateral damage. They're directly punishing the population. But I would not call\nthat a genocide, right? And I would not compare\nthat to the Holocaust for one second. I just wanna be very clear on that. - Do you think if Israel could, they would avoid the\ndeath of any civilians? So, you're saying there's some degree of punishment of collective- - No, they're purposely killing civilians. This is the iron wall. They're trying to beat the Palestinians in the submission, right? There's no way you kill\nthis many civilians if you're trying to precisely\ntake out Hamas fighters. And by the way, the Israeli spokesman, the IDF spokesman has explicitly said that we are not pursuing\nprecision bombing. And that what we are doing is trying to maximize the amount\nof destruction and damage that we can inflict on the Palestinians. And I think this is a major\nmistake on the part of Israel. First of all, it ends up being a moral\nstain on your reputation, number one. And number two, it doesn't\nwork. It doesn't work. The Palestinians are not gonna roll over and submit to Israeli\ndomination of their life. So, the whole concept of the Iron Wall, Jabotinsky's term was misguided. And by the way, if you look at what\nthe Israelis are doing, they're trying to do two things. One is the Iron Wall and that's where you punish\nthe civilian population in Gaza and get them to submit. The other thing that they're\ntrying to do is get Hamas, they wanna destroy Hamas. And the belief there is\nthat if they destroy Hamas, they've solved the problem. But as many Israelis know, including people on the hard right, even if you destroy Hamas, they are going to be\nreplaced by another group, another resistance group and that resistance\ngroup will employ terror. - Yeah, I think you've said that other terrorist organizations\nhave used this situation in Palestine as a kind of\na recruitment mechanism for a long time. - Osama bin Laden made it clear that this was one of\nthis principle reasons for attacking the United States, right? - And the United States attacked back and got us into a 20-year war that cost the lives of millions of people. Not American, but I mean human beings. - [John] And engaged in torture. - Torture, yeah. - No, I think if you look\nat how we reacted to 9/11 and how the Israelis are reacting to what\nhappened on October 7th, there's quite a bit of\nsimilarity in that both sides, the Israeli side and the\nAmerican side are enraged, right? And they lash out and\nthey go on a rampage, and the end result is not good. - Is there a capacity within\nIsrael or within United States after 9/11 to do something approximating, turn the other cheek of understanding the root of terror, this hate and fighting that hate with, not to sound naive, but compassion. - Well, I don't think in either case, you're gonna turn the other cheek. - I think- - Well, some, what I mean by that is, some limited powerful military\nresponse, but very limited. - Yeah, coupled with a\nsmart political strategy. - [Lex] Political\nstrategy, diplomacy, yeah. - That's what they\nshould have done, right? - But is there capacity for that or from your offensive\nrealism perspective, it's just the odds are really low? - Well, from my offensive\nrealist perspective or my realist perspective that's\nwhat you should do, right? - [Lex] Okay. - My view is states are rational actors, they should be cunning, right? They should think about, the strategic situation they're in and choose the appropriate response. And what happens and this is why my theory\nis not always correct, is that sometimes states are not rational and they misbehave. I would argue in the Israeli case that it would've been\ngood after October 7th or starting on October 7th, if the United States had tried\nto hold the Israelis back and countenance a more moderate response, take some time just to\nthink about how to deal with this problem, instead of lashing out. I think, given what\nhappened to the Israelis, given how shocked they were, given the level of fear, given the level of rage\nthey were gonna lash out and I don't believe that\nwas in their interest, I think it would've made\nsense to think about it and to think about a smarter strategy than they're now employing. And I think the Americans blew it. The Americans gave 'em a\nbear hug and a green light and said, we'll give you\nall the weaponry you need and go out and do it. And I don't think that\nwas the smart thing to do. Look, in the wake of October 7th, the Israelis had no good strategy, right? It's not like there's a magic formula that they just didn't see. And we should have told them what the magic formula was, right? That's not true. They were in a sense, caught\nbetween a rock and a hard place in terms of what to do. But they're smarter\nthings than number things. And I think the Israelis lashed out in ways that are counterproductive. I think going on a rampage and killing huge numbers\nof civilians is not, it's obviously morally wrong, but it's also just not in their\nstrategic interest, right? I mean, 'cause it's not gonna\nbuy them anything, right? And in fact, it's gonna cost them, right? Because people all over the planet, are turning against Israel. I saw an Israeli think tank today that has been tracking\nprotests around the world, gave some figures for what it looked like, between October 7th and October 13th in terms of the number of\nprotests around the world that were pro-Israel versus pro-Palestine. And then it looked at the numbers from October 13th up to the present, and I think the numbers were\n69% were pro-Palestinian in the first six days\nafter October 7th, 69%. And I think 31% take these\nnumbers with a grain of salt. 31% were pro-Israel. So, I think it was 69 and 31. And since then, since October 13th, if you look at the number of\nprotests around the world, 95% have been pro-Palestinian\nand 5% have been pro-Israel. And what this tells you is that public opinion around the world has shifted against Israel. And if you look at some\nof the demonstrations in places like London and Washington, DC, it's truly amazing the number\nof people who are coming out in support of the Palestinians. And all of this, again, is\njust to support my point that it was just not smart for Israel to launch this bombing campaign, right? You can make an argument\nfor going after Hamas and doing it in a surgical way or as surgical way as possible. But that's not what they did. And again, my point to you is I think that this punishment campaign is not gonna work strategically. In other words, they're not gonna beat the\nPalestinians into submission. They're not gonna finish off Hamas. And at the same time, by\npursuing this strategy, they're doing huge damage to their reputation around the world. - Well, I just, yeah, in\nthe wake of October 7th, given the geopolitical context, I think there's a lot of leverage to be the great ethical superpower that demonstrate power\nwithout killing any civilians. And use that leverage diplomatic leverage to push forward something\nlike Abrahamic Accords with more nations, with Saudi Arabia, push for peace aggressively, peace agreements, this kind of stuff, economic relationships,\nall of this kind of stuff. And thereby pressure the\nPalestinian authority, towards perhaps the two-state solution. - But I think what you're missing here, just in the Israeli case, is that the Israeli\nGovernment is not interested in two-state solution. And you wanna remember\nthat Benjamin Netanyahu, who looks very hawkish when\nyou look at him in isolation, doesn't look so hawkish when you look at him compared\nto the rest of the people in his cabinet, right? He almost looks like a moderate. He's got a lot of people who are way out to the right of him. And these people in this of\ncourse, includes Netanyahu, are not interested in\nthe two-state solution. So, the question you have\nto ask yourself is you, if you're Benjamin Netanyahu, and it's July 7th, late in the, excuse me, October 7th, late\nin the day, what do you do? You're not thinking about\na two-state solution. You're thinking about an\noccupation that's not gonna end. And the question is how do you\ndeal with the Palestinians, given what's just happened? - Well, there's people in the cabinet and then there's history. And history remembers great leaders. And so Benjamin Netanyahu can\nlook in the streets of Israel and see the protests and think of how history\nwill remember him. And I think a two-state solution is on the table for a great leader. - Well, it was there, was he the person who was\ngonna take advantage of it? I don't think so, but we'll see. - Well, at this point, I mean, at this point,\nit's very difficult. Like you said, 95% now\nor whatever the number is of protests. I think the window in which Israel has the ears of the world, it can do the big ethical peace action, action towards peace is, I think has closed or maybe\nthere's still a slither, but it's just the slippery\nslope of hate has taken off. It's quite depressing to watch. - Yep, I agree a hundred percent\nunequivocally depressing. - But of course, as you talk about the the US involvement is of critical importance\nhere for the United States. And the argument you make is that we should not\nbe involved in Ukraine at least to the degree we are. We being the United States and we should not be involved\nin Israel to the degree we are because it's stretching us too thin. When the big geopolitical\ncontender in the 21st Century with United States is China. Is that a correct summary? - Yeah, I think just on Ukraine, we should not have pushed\nUkraine to join NATO. - [Lex] Sure. - And once the war started, we should have worked overtime\nto shut it down immediately. - [Lex] Yeah, March. - March, right? And you remember, by the way, not to go back to Ukraine in great detail. In the fall, early fall of 2022, the war starts February, 2022. There's March, 2022,\nwhich we've talked about, which is in negotiations\nin the fall of 2022, I think it was in September, the Ukrainians had won two\nmajor tactical victories, one in Hassan and the other in Kiev. And at that point in time general Millie, who was the chairman of the\njoint Chiefs of staff said, now is the time to negotiate, because this is the high\nwatermark for the Ukrainians. Millie understood that things\nwere only gonna get worse and the White House shut Millie down and said, we're not negotiating. So, we have blown a number\nof opportunities here to head this problem off at the pass. But that's my view there and\nwith regard to the Israelis, my only point about Israel is that it would be better for Israel and better for the United States if we the United States was in a position, the United States was in\na position to put pressure on Israel from time to time. As Steve and I say in the book, we should be able to treat Israel, like a normal country, right? The fact is that countries\nsometimes do stupid things. This includes the United\nStates and Israel. And if Israel is pursuing a\npolicy that we think is unwise, we should be in a position where we could put pressure on Israel. That's our argument, right? But anyway, we goofed both\nwith regard to Ukraine and with regard to the Middle East. And we're now up to our\neyeballs in alligators in both of those regions. And as you described my view, this is not good, because the area of the\nmost strategic importance for the United States today is East Asia. And that's because China is there and China is the most serious threat the United States faces."

      "text": "- Do you think there\nwill be a war with China in the 21st century? - I don't know. My argument is there will be, there is right now a serious\nsecurity competition, and at the same time, there is a real possibility of war. Whether or not we avoid\nit is very hard to say. I mean, we did, during the Cold War, we had a serious security competition from roughly 1947 to 1989. And we thankfully avoided war, probably came the closest in 1962 at the Cuban Missile Crisis. But we avoided it. And I think we can avoid it here. Is it for sure? No. - You've said that China won't\nmove on Taiwan militarily, in part because it's, as you said, amphibious\noperations are difficult. Why will China not move\non Taiwan in your sense, in the near future? - Well, it's because\nthere's this body of water, called the Taiwan Strait, which is a big body of water. And getting across\nwater is very difficult, unless you can walk on water. - So, geography still has a role to play in the 21st century? - Oh, yeah, I think\ngeography's very important. Big bodies of water really matter. In an ideal world, you'd like\nto have the Pacific Ocean, between you and any potential adversary, 6,000 miles. - [Lex] Yes. - 6,000 miles of water. Hard to get across. - [Lex] Yeah. - If you're a country, and I'm a country and there's land between us, I can take my Panzer divisions and I can go right across the\nland and get into your country or attack your country. And you of course can\ntake your Panzer divisions and come across that same piece of land. But if there's a big\nbody of water between us, your Panzer divisions\ncan't go across the water. And then the question is, how do you get 'em across the water? And that's very tricky. And in a world we have lots of submarines and you have lots of aircraft, and you have missiles that are land-based that can hit those surface ships. It is very, very hard to\nattack across a body of water. And all you have to do\nis think about Normandy, the American invasion of Normandy, June 6th, 1944 coming in\non Omaha Beach, right? Oh boy, that was really difficult. - But there is a growing\nasymmetry of military power there that even though it's difficult. - That is correct. - [Lex] So, I guess- - That is correct. - So, obviously I had a\nconversation with Elon Musk and he says that China is quite serious, about the One China Policy, and it seems inevitable\nthat Taiwan will have to be, if you look at this pragmatically\nin the 21st century, it seems inevitable that Taiwan, will have to be a part of China. And so we can get there either\ndiplomatically or militarily, what do you think about the inevitability of that kind of idea? When a nation says this\nis a top priority for us, what do you think about them meaning it and what do we do about that? - There's no question it's\na top priority for them. And there's no question they mean it, but it's also a top priority for us not to let them take Taiwan. - [Lex] Why exactly? - Because it's an\nimportant strategic asset. Many people will say it's\nbecause Taiwan's a democracy, but that doesn't matter that much. It's because of two strategic reasons. The first is that if we\nwere to let Taiwan go, it would have hugely negative consequences for our alliance structure in East Asia. To contain China we need allies. We have an alliance\nstructure and our allies, Japanese, South Koreans,\nFilipinos, Australians, they're all counting on\nus to be there for them. And if we say we're not\ngonna defend Taiwan, the Chinese attack, they're gonna say, I bet\nif the Chinese attack us, the Americans won't be there for us. So, it would have a damaging effect on our alliance structure\nwhich we cannot afford, 'cause containing China\nis a wicked problem. It's a powerful state. You were getting to this before when you talked about China versus Taiwan. So, that's the first reason. Second reason is you wanna\nbottle up the Chinese Navy and the Chinese Air Force\ninside the first Island chain. You don't wanna let them\nget out into the Pacific. You don't want them dominating\nthe waters of East Asia. You wanna bottle them up again, inside the first island chain. And you can only do that\nif you control Taiwan. You don't control Taiwan, they get out, into the Philippines Sea, into the Pacific and the Western Pacific and\ncause all sorts of problems. - Well, you saying all that, you've also said the\nCentury of Humiliation. Japan and the United States are a source of that\nhumiliation for China. Don't you think they see\nthe other side of that? - [John] Absolutely. - And in the interest\nof avoiding a world war, I guess the question is how\ndo we avoid a world war? It doesn't seem like\nthe military involvement in the conflict between\nChina and Taiwan is the way - [John] Well, I don't want- - There's no good answers here. I'm just saying which\nis the less bad option. - Well, what you wanna do is you wanna make sure\nthat you deter China from invading Taiwan. You wanna avoid a war. You and I are in complete\nagreement on that. We don't want a war, but\nwe wanna contain China. We do not wanna let China dominate Asia. That's what the Americans are principally concerned with here. And it's with China's neighbors are principally concerned with. This includes the Japanese,\nthe South Koreans, the Filipinos, Australians\nand the Taiwanese. They don't want and we don't want China\nto dominate the region. So, we have to contain it. But at the same time and this should be music to your ears, we not only want to contain it, we wanna make sure we don't end up in a shooting match with the Chinese, 'cause this could be disastrous. So, you have to have a very smart policy. You have to build powerful military forces and you have to make sure\nyou don't do anything that's provocative. On Taiwan, for example, the last thing you want is\nfor the Taiwanese government to declare its independence. Because the Chinese have said, if Taiwan does that, we'll go to war. And of course, we don't want that. So, my view is you wanna smartly build up your military forces and you wanna do everything\nyou can to contain China and at the same time, not be provocative. - So, a big component of that\nis making sure your military, the US military is bigger\nthan the Chinese military. - Not necessarily. It's an interesting question. A lot of people think that to\nmake the Terence work right, you have to be able to beat the Chinese, and therefore you need\na much bigger military. And I don't think over time\nthat's possible, right? I think it's probably\nnot even possible now to beat the Chinese in a war over Taiwan or in a war in the South China Sea. I think what you want to do is\nmake it clear to the Chinese, either that there will be no winner. In other words, you don't have to win, but you wanna make sure\nthey don't win, okay? It's a lose lose proposition if they go to war over\nTaiwan or what have you. And if you can't do that, you think that they're so powerful that they're ultimately gonna win. You wanna convince them that victory, would be a pyrrhic victory. In other words, they would pay a godawful\nprice to win the war. You follow what I'm saying? So, (John coughing) excuse me. The best strategy for deterrence\nis you win, China loses. Second best strategy is\na stalemate, nobody wins. Third best strategy is they win, but they pay a godawful price. And the fourth possibility,\nwhich you don't want, is they went quickly\nand decisively, right? If that's the case, then you don't have much deterrence. - What does a world with China as the sole dominant superpower look like? I mean, a little bit\nunderlying our discussion is this kind of idea\nthat US is the good guys and China is the bad guys. First of all, dividing\nthe world into good guys and bad guys seems to\nsomehow miss the nuance of this whole human civilization\nproject we're undertaking. But what does the world look like where China is the\ndominant soul superpower in a unipolar world? - Well, I don't tend to think of the world in terms of good guys and\nbad guys as a good realist. I think that states are states, they're all black boxes. I don't discriminate between\ndemocracies and autocracies. But having said that, I\nam an American, right? And as an American, I'm interested in the\nsecurity of my country, the survival of my country. So, I want the United States to be the most powerful\nstate in the world, which means I want the United States to dominate the Western hemisphere. I want us to be a regional hegemony. And I wanna make sure that\nChina does not dominate Asia, the way we dominate\nthe Western hemisphere. It's not because I think\nwe're the good guys and they're the bad guys. If I were Chinese and I were in Beijing, and I was Xi Jing Ping's\nnational security advisor, I'd tell him what we gotta do is, make sure we dominate the\nworld or dominate our region and then do everything we can to undermine America's position in the Western hemisphere, right? That'd be my view. So, I guess you could\nsay I do view the world in terms of good guys and bad guys, 'cause I'm an American and I- - More like us and them versus- - Yeah, it's us and them. That's a nice way to put it. Yeah, it's us versus them, not so much good guys versus bad guys. - Is it possible to have a stable, peaceful world with a\ngood balance of power with where it's China\nand US as superpowers? It's a bipolar world, no longer unipolar. - Yeah, okay. So, you're hypothesizing a\nworld where they dominate Asia. - [Lex] Yeah. - And we dominate the Western hemisphere. - [Lex] Yep. - I believe there would be a great deal of security competition, intense security competition\nbetween those two superpowers. - The definition of intense matters here. So, it could be small, small military conflicts or it could be extremely large, unstable military conflicts, right? - Well, conflict, let's use the word war. - [Lex] Okay. - So, I distinguish between\nsecurity competition and war. And what I'm telling you, is you'll have an intense\nsecurity competition where there's no shooting\nor if there's shooting, it's mainly proxies that\nare doing the fighting. - [Lex] Got it. - Much like the Vietnam War, right? Or you could have a case\nwhere one of those superpowers was involved in a war against a proxy of the other superpower. Korean War, think the Korean War, the United States fought the Chinese who were allied with\nthe Soviets at the time. But a war between the\nUnited States and China, just like a war between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. That's what you really wanna avoid. So, I think you'd have an intense security competition, right? You'd have wars involving proxies of each of those two superpowers. And you would probably have some wars where one of the superpowers\nwas involved in a proxy, right? With the other superpowers proxies. - So, it seems likely then, if that's the case then it\nwould be Taiwan is the proxy and US fighting China\nthrough the proxy of Taiwan. - Well, that would\nassume the United States. But you wanna remember, you're hypothesizing a situation\nwhere China dominates Asia. - [Lex] Oh, already has dominated Asia. - Yeah, it's already dominated Taiwan. - [Lex] I see. Where do you find the proxies? Australia? - The Middle East could be a good case. - [Lex] Oh, wow. - Persian Gulf. - Oh boy. And then our discussion of Israel, becomes even more dramatically- - Well, Israel gets involved, I think in this scenario, if you're talking about a\nUS China competition, right? And you're talking about the Middle East, I think it's the Gulf, it's the Saudis, the Iranians,\nthe Iraqis, it's the oil. - Don't you think it could\nbe Israel versus Iran with some very 1984 kind\nof dramatic partnership of Iran, Russia, and China\nversus United States, Europe and Israel. - I think that's possible, yeah. - [Lex] Oh boy. - I think that's possible, yeah. Now that I thought, I mean, I hadn't thought\nabout it until you said it, but yeah, I think that is possible - Isn't that terrifying? - Yeah, well, that, in your scenario where\nChina already dominate Asia and we dominate the Western hemisphere. I think you start talking about\nwhere the most likely places that the United States\nand China go head to head or fight through proxies. I think it is the Gulf for the Middle East and the scenario that you posit. - I mean, one question I have, I don't know about you, but for me, unlike with the Soviet Union and I know I was born there, but even outside of that, the cultural gap, the laws in translation, the communication gap between\nChina and the United States, seems to be much greater than that of what was the form Soviet\nUnion and the United States. I see two cultures\nintermingling and communicating as one of the ways to\ndeescalate future conflict. - It's an interesting question. I mean it at a sort of an\nabstract theoretical level, my argument is that great\npowers act according to realist dictates and they understand\nthose realist dictates. And that could lead to\ncooperation or it can lead to war. It depends. I would say, just in the case of the Soviets, a lot of people describe the Cold War as an ideological\ncompetition above all else, it's was communism\nversus liberal democracy or communism versus liberal\ncapitalism, whatever. I actually don't believe that, I believe the Soviets\nwere realist to the core. I believe Stalin was a\nrealist par excellence. And that ideology did not matter much in Stalin's foreign policy. And I believe if you look\nat Soviet foreign policy after World War II,\nthroughout the Cold War, they were realists to the core. And I think in those days, the Americans were realists, right? A lot of liberal ideology\nfloating around out there. But the Americans were realists. And I think one of the reasons you avoided a shooting match between the United States and the Soviet Union from '47 to '89 was because both sides, I think understood basic\nbalance of power logic. US-China competition\nis somewhat different. First of all, the Chinese\nare realist to the core. I've spent a lot of time in China. I basically have rock and roll, I'm basically a rock\nand roll star in China. The Chinese- - You're kind of a big\ndeal in China, I love it. - The Chinese are my kind of people. - [Lex] Yeah. - They're realists, right? They speak my language. - [Lex] Yeah. - It's the United States\nthat is not very realist. American leaders have a\nvery powerful liberal bent and tend not to see the\nworld in realist terms. I believe, by the way, just going back to our\ndiscussion of NATO expansion, I think our inability to\nunderstand that NATO expansion was anathema to the Russians was do in large part to\nthe fact that we just, during the unipolar moment, didn't think of international politics from a realist perspective, and didn't respect anyone who thought about international politics from a realist perspective, if those various American administrations, starting with the Clinton administration had put their realist hat on, they would've understood that\nNATO expansion into Ukraine was not a good idea. But we had this thoroughly\nliberal view of the world that dominated our thinking. And it's gone way somewhat, since we've moved into\nmultipolarity, but not completely. And this makes me a little nervous, right? To pick up on your point. I mean, the United States\nis thinking about the world in ways that are somewhat\ndifferent than the Chinese who are real as par excellence. - So, that's fascinating. So, the Chinese are pragmatic\nabout thinking of the world and as a competition of military powers, all the ways in which you\ndescribed the realist perspective. So, I mean that's a hopeful thing, right? If we can achieve stability and a balance of powers through\nthat military competition. - Yeah, I actually think that's right, I think if the United States, just let me talk a little\nbit about the United States to get at the issue you're raising. If the United States pursues\na smart containment strategy, given what you just said and\nI said about the Chinese, I think we will avoid war. The problem with the Americans is it's not just the liberalism. It's the possibility that we\nwill pursue a rollback policy. In other words, during the Cold War, we pursued containment. It was, whenever anybody talked, about American grand strategy\ntowards the Soviet Unions it was containment,\ncontainment, containment. We now know from the historical record that the United States was\nnot only pursuing containment, it was pursuing rollback. We were trying to roll back Soviet power, to put it bluntly, we were trying to wreck\nthe Soviet Union, okay? And I would not be\nsurprised moving forward with regard to China if\nthe United States pursues a serious rollback policy. - So, you're saying throughout history, United States was always\ndoing that always? Well, where's that from? Why can't we respect the\npower of other nations? - 'Cause they may be a threat to us. - Well, I mean, you don't look, you don't respect the\npower of other nations. You fear the power of other nations. - Well, fear and respect\nare next door neighbors, depending on the neighborhood\nyou're living in. But I just mean it could be\nvery counterproductive to try, because if you can empathize with their, if you assume their rational actors, you trying to roll back will create, would lean into the uncertainty\nof potential conflicts, you wanna avoid the uncertainty of potential conflict caution, right? - Well, yes and no. Look, your point is you wanna empathize, you wanna be able to put yourself in the shoes of the other side. - [Lex] Yes. - I agree 100% with that, right? It's very important if you're\na first class strategist to be able to do that. But at the same time, there is this competition\nfor power taking place. And what you wanna do is maximize how much power you have\nrelative to the other side. And the other side wants to maximize how much power it has relative to you. So, you have this\ncompetition for power, right? That's taking place all the time and that's taking place at the same time, you wanna have empathy or you wanna be able to put yourself in the shoes of the other side. So, those two things kind\nof go together, right? - It just feels less threatening to build up your thing, versus try to hurt the\nother person's thing, the other group's thing. - Right, but if you\nbuild up your own power, you are building up your capability to hurt the other side. - Right, but like you, I guess you don't rattle the saber, just work on manufacturing sabers. - Well, that I agree with. I think that the United States, wants to make sure it has\na big stake in East Asia for purposes of containing\nChina and avoiding a war, right? Again, I wanna be clear, I'm not advocating that\nwe start World War III, but the point is, you wanna have a big stake and you wanna make sure that you don't overstep your bounds in terms of using that big stake. This is the danger with rollback, right? That you get too aggressive and you precipitate a war, right? And you also just have to be\nvery careful what you say. And to go back to your favorite argument, you wanna be able to have empathy or put yourself in the\nshoes of the other side, 'cause if you do something, you wanna think smartly\nabout what that other side, how that other side is\ngonna see your action and how they're gonna react, right? - And mostly focus on the carrots, have a giant stick laying around, but never mention it,\njust focus on the carrots. - Well, occasionally you have\nto mention the stake, right? - No, everyone knows the stake is there, - There is some truth in that, right? - I mean, yeah. But and words matter a lot. It feels, this current President Biden's\nmeeting with Xi Jinping and I think the wars exchange\nthere are really important. I have a notion that\nleaders can stop wars, just as much as they can start wars. - Well, leaders matter. There's no question about that. No question. But just on on rhetoric, you wanna remember that Putin has, on more than one occasion, very subtly rattled the nuclear sword. - [Lex] Oh, yeah. - And it has been very effective, because Joe Biden has paid attention. And Joe Biden wants to\nmake sure we don't end up in a thermonuclear war. And thank goodness he's thinking that way. So, all Putin has to do\nis mention the possibility of nuclear war, just to go back to Taiwan, switch areas of the world. If you're interested in containing China and you're interested in deterrence and let's go back to\nthose various scenarios where the Chinese win, we win, Chinese win but they do it at a costly, at great cost. One could argue that that\ndiscussion that I laid out before, didn't take into account nuclear weapons. And all President Biden or any of his successors has to do is just very subtly rattle or employ the nuclear threat and just sort of remind the Chinese that you start a war over Taiwan, it could easily escalate\ninto a nuclear war. You wanna understand we\nboth have nuclear weapons and if either one of us is put\ninto a desperate situation, we may turn to those nuclear weapons. And oh, by the way, Xi Jinping, you wanna understand that\nwe're out here in the water and using nuclear weapons in the water. It's not that it's not the same as using war nuclear weapons on lands. So, we may very well use them. I'm not saying we will, but anyway, a little\nsaber rattling, right? - Yeah. Let me just zoom out on human history. What makes empires collapse and what makes them last when they do? When you look at human\nhistory in your sense, thinking about the United\nStates perhaps as an empire. - I don't view the United\nStates as an empire. - What's the definite? So, to you empire as a thing that seeks expansion constantly? - Yeah, I think it's a country that incorporates different regions or areas around the world into sort of a giant sphere of influence, without incorporating those territories, actually into the state itself. So, you had this thing\ncalled the British Empire, and it controlled areas like India, North America and Kenya. Just to pick a couple\ninstances at different points. Singapore would be another example. Australia would be another example. So, these were all entities that were part of the\nBritish Empire, right? And the United States has\ntaken a stab at Empire, after the Spanish\nAmerican War for example, with regard to the Philippines\nand Cuba and Puerto Rico. But we never got serious about it. There's never been an American empire. This is not to say the United States is not an incredibly powerful country that goes all around the\nworld building military bases and stationing troops here,\nthere, and everywhere. But we're not running an empire the way the British Empire\nwas run or the French Empire. So, the question for me is,\nwhy did those empires go away? Why did the British Empire go away? If you ever look at a\nmap of the world in 1922, after World War I, it's truly amazing how much of that map is controlled by Britain, right? They had a huge empire\nand it's disappeared - Probably by far the biggest in terms of area empire in\nhuman history, I think so. - I think that's right. It almost has to be. - Yeah, right, It's crazy. - It crazy, yeah. And then no longer is the case. - Now, I wanna be clear, the Americans have wield that\nmaybe even greater influence than Britain did when it had its empire. But I don't believe we have an empire that bears any resemblance\nto the British Empire. So, the question is, what\nhappened to that British empire? What happened to the French Empire? What happened to the Belgian Empire? What happened to the Dutch Empire? These were countries that had\ncolonies all over the planet. The Dutch East Indies, right? Vietnam was French Indochina. Where did those empires go? Two factors finished them off. Number one, nationalism. Nationalism became a very powerful force in the 19th century. It began to rear its head\nin the late 18th century and became a very\npowerful force in the 19th and certainly in the 20th. - Can you explain nationalism here? - Nationalism is the idea\nthat these different nations that were part of the\nempire, like the Kenyans, wanted their own state, nation state. This is my point about\nthe Palestinians, right? This is Palestinian nationalism. What is Zionism? Zionism is Jewish nationalism, Jewish nationalism. Think of Theodore Herzl's famous book. It's called \"The Jewish State,\" nation state. Think of the word nation state that embodies nationalism, nation state, Jewish state. Palestinians want their own state, two-state solution, right? Can't beat the Palestinians\ninto submission, right? The Indians wanted their own state. The Pakistanis wanted their own state. The Kenyans wanted their own state. Singapore wanted its own state. Oh, the Americans wanted their own state. This is called the American Revolution. - [Lex] Yep. - Right. So, that's the first reason, nationalism, that these empires disappeared. The second reason is that\nfrom a cost benefit analysis, they no longer made any sense. And it was the coming of\nthe Industrial Revolution. Once the industrial revolution comes, an empire is basically an\nalbatross around your neck. I would argue that the British Empire was an albatross around Britain's neck in most of the 20th century. Some of my friends disagree with that and think there were all sorts of benefits from the British Empire. But you wanna remember\nthat in the 20th century, the three countries that\nreally were powerful were the United States,\nGermany and the Soviet Union. Those were the big three. Did any of them have an empire? No. - That's a good card. - In the industrial world, you don't need an empire, right? What you need is a powerful\nmanufacturing base. - Well, the cost benefit\nanalysis is different. Before the Industrial Revolution,\nthere's been many empires. - There's no question that\nempires came and went, right? I mean, right? You have to do is just look\nat the British and the French in the seven years war. 1756 to 1763, the British win. They get Canada, right? And that's why Quebec, Montreal, all these big French speaking, areas are now part of Canada, right? So, borders change and\ncountries got established. The United States being one and remember South American\nand Central America were once completely\ndominated by the Spanish. And in the case of Brazil, the Portuguese. But they all in the 19th century, got their independence, right? And what I'm saying to you is in the 19th and in the 20th century, there were two forces that\nwere really driving the train. One is nationalism and then the other is the\nindustrial revolution, which changes the cost-benefit analysis. - Almost too crazy of a question. But if you look, let me calculate, let's say, 500 years from now, and you John Mearsheimer\ntraveled through time and are at a bookstore, looking at the entire\nhistory of human civilization in a single book. What role does US play? Like what's the story of\nUS over the next a hundred, 200, 300 years? Is it a big role, small role? - Well, that's a long time. If you asked me, let's just\nsay the next hundred years. - Yeah, that's still tough. - Okay, I think, that's still tough. But actually, I think\nwe're in excellent shape. And here's the reason, going back to the beginning\nof our conversation, you asked me about power. And I told you the two principle\nbuilding blocks of power are population size and wealth, okay? And therefore, you wanna\nlook around the world and you wanna look at what\nyou think the demographics are of countries like Britain, the United States, Iran, China, Russia pick your country moving forward, right? What do the demographics look like and how wealthy are those\ncountries likely to be? What you discover very quickly is that almost every\ncountry around the world is depopulating over time, right? Russia's gonna be much smaller. China's gonna be much smaller\na hundred years from now than both of those countries are as best we can tell. United States, American women are not having\nlots of babies these days. No question about that. But we have immigration. We're an immigrant culture. You're a perfect manifestation of that. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - You're a perfect,\nyou're now an American. That's wonderful. We need more people like you, right? So, when I hear Donald Trump and others arguing that\nimmigration's a terrible thing, this is ridiculous. - [Lex] That's fascinating. - Immigration is what\nmade us great, right? It's when my relatives\ncame over in the middle of the 19th century from\nGermany and Ireland, right? - That's fascinating. Like because there's there's\nbeen a huge concern in America and other developed nations\nand not having enough children. But you just made me realize in the long arc of history, the United States has\ngotten really damn good at integrating immigrants and\nlike helping them flourish. The whole diversity that makes up America. - [John] You're absolutely right. - There's a machinery of\nintegrating other cultures. - Yeah, just very quickly on this. - [Lex] That's fascinating. - Sam Huntington's book, \"Who are We?\" Which in many ways, I love that book. But it has one fundamental flaw. And a number of people told him beforehand that that flaw existed\nand he didn't fix it. But Sam argues in the book that we have large numbers\nof Hispanics in this country and we're doing a very poor\njob of integrating them into the mainstream. And they're not becoming Americans. And because many of them are concentrated in the southwest of the United States, unlike other ethnic groups\nthat were spread out, all over God's little green acre, right? We're gonna have this cohesive group of Spanish speaking Americans, right? Who are gonna want to break away. And the United States is no longer gonna be a\nreasonably coherent nation state. He's wrong. All the evidence is that\nHispanics are integrating into the American mainstream more quickly and more effectively than\nthe European immigrant groups that came starting around 1835. If you look at immigration from Europe into the United States, leaving aside the original Wasps who came over and founded the place, the immigrants start coming\nin large numbers in 1835. And we really don't shut\nthe door until 1924, right? Starting this is a crude\noverview starting in 1835 and running up till about 1885. It's mainly Germans and Irish. That's why Germans are\nthe largest ethnic group to ever come to the United States. And the Irish are right behind them. These are the European ethnic\ngroups we're talking about. Then starting in 1885, Poles, Jews and Italians\nstart coming, right? And the Germans and Irish keep coming. And this is why Ellis Island\nis opened, I think it's 1893. Ellis Island is opened because\nCastle Garden in New York, which had handled all\nthe previous immigrants, coming across the pond, Castle Garden couldn't handle them all. So, they opened up Ellis Island. That's why somebody like me, I can't find my distant relatives\nrecords in Ellis Island, 'cause they came through\nCastle Garden, right? Whereas lots of Jews I know, lots of Italians I know they could find their relatives\nrecords in Ellis Island, 'cause they came through Ellis Island. The point is, you had all these immigrants who came in roughly between 1835 and 1924 when we shut the gates. It was the only time we've\never really shut the gates in a meaningful way, right? And this is what made\nAmerica great, right? All these people and they\nmade lots of babies, right? - So, in some sense, make America great again means\ngetting more immigrants in? - Well we opened the gates again in '65, closed them in '24, opened 'em in '65. I'm oversimplifying the story here, 'cause we didn't completely shut them. We almost completely shut\nthem in '24, opened in '65 and we've had huge numbers\nof immigrants flowing in. These immigrants who have\nbeen flowing in since '65 are not Europeans. They're not mainly Europeans, they're mainly Hispanics and Asians. If you look at those Hispanics and Asians, they're integrating into\nthe American mainstream at a much faster and more effective clip than was the case with those immigrants who came in in the 19th\ncentury and early 20th century. The Irish, oh my God, they\nwere treated horribly. There's a book a very famous book that's been written called\n\"When the Irish Became White.\" Just think about the title of that book. - [Lex] Yeah. - There was discrimination\nagainst all these groups, right? And the worst discrimination of course was against Chinese Americans, right? But we've gotten much better. And what we should do moving\nforward is redouble our efforts to integrate immigrants into\nthe American mainstream. Hispanics, Asians of all sorts, because the fact is that America is rapidly reaching the point where it's not gonna be an\nall white country, right? I have five children and\ntwo of my children are, I was a generation Z, gen Z. Gen Z is the last majority\nwhite generation, right? Subsequent generations\nare not majority white. So, for anybody who's bothered by this, I'm not bothered by that. But for anybody who is bothered by this, they've better get used to it, because Americans aren't\nmaking enough babies that we can continue\nto grow population wise in a robust way. So, we need immigration and\nwe're an immigrant culture. And this is a great virtue. It has been a great virtue over time. - It should be a source\nof hope, not worry. - That's my view, that's my view. And America, when it works, is a place that is very\nattractive to immigrants. And immigrants can do very well here. And then the real key moving forward is intermarriage, right? And you have a huge amount\nof intermarriage, right? Somebody was telling me not too long ago that the highest intermarriage rates in the United States\nare among Asian women. Asian American women. Asian women and Anglos, right? And I say wonderful and- - Great. - Yeah, no, the more- - Love is the fastest way to integrate. - Yeah, well you don't, what you wanna do is you wanna\neliminate difference, right? You wanna eliminate difference, right? It's like people who say\nI'm an anti-Semite, right? I have two grandsons who\nAdolf Hitler would've thrown into a gas chamber. One of whose first name is John and middle name is Mearsheimer, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - This is what you want, right? - [Lex] Yeah. Steve Walt's wife and his two children would've\nbeen thrown into a gas chamber by Adolf Hitler, right? This is what you want. You want intermarriage. Now there are a good number of people in some of those groups,\nespecially among Jews who don't like intermarriage, right? But they've lost, because I haven't looked\nrecently at the data among, for intermarriage rates\namong basically secular Jews. But it used to be around 62%, large numbers of Jews marry Guam. - And they've lost\nbecause of intermarriage. Intermarriage helps fight tribalism. Destructive kind of tribalism, it's nice. - Calling me an antisemite. They haven't met my\ngrandsons, my son-in-law, a niece that I have, nephews that I have. Brother-in-laws that I have, Jewish, right? Come on. - And this gives a really\nnice hopeful view of America is the integration of different cultures, different kinds of peoples. That is a unique property of America. - Yes, but just to go\nback to where we started, it was not smooth in the beginning. - All things are rough in the beginning. - All things are rough in the beginning. - What advice would you give\nto a young person today,"

      "text": "about how to have a career\nthey can be proud of or a life they can be proud of? - Well, I think it's very\nimportant to make sure that you do something in life\nthat really interests you. My mother used to use this\nphrase, floats your boat. You wanna do something\nthat floats your boat or to use another one of\nmy mother's phrase is, you wanna do something\nwhere you get up outta bed in the morning with a\nbounce in your step, right? So, I think that if your mother and father\nwant you to be a lawyer and they're pushing you to be a lawyer and you don't want to be a lawyer, you want to be a policeman,\nbe a policeman, right? Don't do what other people want you to do, 'cause it's very important to find a job, an occupation that you really love. The second thing I would say and this has to do with\nyour point about humility. You wanna think about the\nHumility-Hubris Index. My friend Steve Van\nEvera who teaches at MIT, he and I invented this concept. We call it the Hubris-Humility Index. And you want to have a\nhealthy dose of humility, but you also want to have\na healthy dose of hubris. You want to think you\ncan change the world. You want to think you can make\nthings better for yourself. You want to take chances. You wanna think sometimes that you know better than other people do. Hubris is not a bad thing. But at the same time, you\nhave to have humility. - [Lex] Yeah. - You have to understand\nthat a man or a woman has his or her limits and you\nwanna listen to other people. You wanna be a good listener, right? So, always remember the importance of the Hubris-Humility Index and the importance of having healthy doses of both hubris and humility. - Speaking of humility, you're mortal, like all humans are, do you ponder your mortality? Are you afraid of it? Are you afraid of death? - I'm not sure I'm afraid of death. I don't want to die because\nI enjoy life so much. - [Lex] Having too much fun? - Yeah, given how horrible\nthe world is today, I hate to say that I'm\nhaving too much fun, but do I find what I do\ninteresting and gratifying? I do, I just love what I do and I love studying\ninternational politics. And I love being intellectually curious, about all sorts of subjects. I love talking to you about this and that. I mean, this is really wonderful. And I often tell people thank\ngoodness I'm only 28 years old because I do try to behave\nlike I'm only 28 years old. But I am well aware of the fact that as my mother used to\nsay, nothing is forever and that includes me. And when you're 75 going on 76, you understand that you have a\nlimited number of years left. And I find that depressing, because I've been very lucky and I feel like I've won the lottery and I'm very thankful for that. And I'd like to make it last\nfor as long as possible. But I do understand\nthat nothing is forever. - Yeah, the finiteness of things. - Yeah, you never think\nthat when you're young. I mean, you think you're\ngonna live forever and you're just not gonna get old. I never thought this would happen that I would become 75 years old. - Well, you got so much energy\nand boldness and fearlessness and excitement to you that I'm really grateful to see that, especially given how much\nI'm sure you've been attacked for having bold ideas and presenting them and not losing, yeah, not losing that youthful\nenergy is beautiful to see. - Thank you. - Not becoming cynical. John it's a huge honor to speak with you that you've given me so much time and so much respect and so much love. This was a really incredible conversation. I thank you so much for\neverything you do in the world, for looking out into the world and trying to understand it and teach us. And thank you so much for\ntalking with a silly kid like me. - It was my pleasure. Thank you very much, I\nthoroughly enjoyed it. - Awesome. Thanks for listening to this conversation with John Mearsheimer. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you\nwith some words from Plato, \"Only the dead have seen the end of war.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."

He teaches, speaks and writes\nabout the nature of power and war on the global\nstage in history and today. Please allow me to say once again, my hope for this little journey I'm on, I will speak to everyone on\nall sides with compassion, with empathy, and with backbone. I'll speak with Vladimir Putin and with Vladimir Zelensky, with Russians, and with Ukrainians, with Israelis, and with Palestinians, with everyone. My goal is to do whatever small part I can to decrease the amount\nof suffering in the world by trying to reveal our common humanity. I believe that in the\nend, truth and love wins. I will get attacked for being naive, for being a shell, for being weak. I'm none of those things, but I do make mistakes\nand I will get better. I love you all. This is a \"Lex Fridman Podcast,\" to support it to please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's John Mearsheimer. Can you explain your view on\npower in international politics as outlined in your book, \"The Tragedy of Great Power Politics\" and in your writing since then? - Yeah, I make two sets of points there. First of all, I believe that power is the currency of\ninternational relations. And by that I mean that\nstates are deeply interested in the balance of power and they're interested in\nmaximizing how much power they control. And the question is why states\ncare so much about power. In the international system,\nthere's no higher authority. So, if you get into\ntrouble and you dial 911, there's nobody at the other end. And a system like that,\nyou have no choice, but to figure out for yourself\nhow best to protect yourself. And the best way to protect\nyourself is to be powerful, to have as much power as you can possibly gain\nover all the other states in the system. Therefore, states care about power, because it enhances or maximizes their prospects for survival. Second point I would make is that in the real story or in my story, power is largely a function\nof material factors. The two key building blocks of power are population size and wealth. You wanna have a lot of people and you want to be really wealthy. Of course, this is why the\nUnited States is so powerful. It has lots of people and\nit has lots of wealth. China was not considered a\ngreat power until recently, because it didn't have a lot of wealth, certainly had population size,\nbut it didn't have wealth. And without both a large\npopulation and much wealth, you're usually not\nconsidered a great power. So, I think power matters, but when we talk about power, it's important to understand\nthat it's population size and wealth that are underpinning it. - So there's a lot of\ninteresting things there. First you said nations in relation to each other are, is essentially in a state of anarchism. - Yeah, well, anarchy basically means the opposite of hierarchy. Sometimes people think when\nyou're talking about anarchy, you're talking about murder and mayhem, but that's not what anarchy\nmeans in the realist context. Anarchy simply means that\nyou don't have hierarchy. There's no higher authority\nthat sits above states. States are like pool\nballs on a table, right? And in an anarchic world, there's no higher authority that you can turn to if\nyou get into trouble. And of course the political philosopher who laid this all out was Thomas Hobbes. And Hobbes talked about\nlife in the state of nature. And in the state of nature\nyou have individuals and those individuals compete\nwith each other for power. And the reason that they do is because in the state\nof nature, by definition, you have no higher authority. And Hobbes's view is\nthat the way to get out of this terrible situation where individuals are\ncompeting with each other and even killing each\nother is to create a state. It's what he calls the Leviathan. And that, of course is the\ntitle of his famous book. So, the idea is to escape anarchy, you create a state and that means you go\nfrom anarchy to hierarchy. The problem in international politics is that there is no world\nstate, there is no hierarchy. And if you have no hierarchy and you're in an anarchic system, you have no choice but to try to maximize your relative power to make sure you are, as we used to say when I was a kid on New York City playgrounds, the biggest and baddest dude on the block. Not because you necessarily\nwant to beat up on other kids or on other states, but because again, that's\nthe best way to survive. And as I like to point out to people, the best example of what happens when you're weak in international politics is what the Chinese call the\nCentury of National Humiliation from the late 1840s to the late 1940s, the Chinese were remarkably weak and the great powers in the\nsystem preyed upon them. And that sends a very important message to not only the Chinese, but\nto other states in the system. Don't be weak, be as powerful as you can. - And we'll talk about it. But humiliation can lead to resentment or resentment leads to\nsomething you've also studied, which is Nazi Germany in the 1930s. We'll talk about it. But staying to the psychology\nand philosophy picture, what's the connection\nbetween the will to power in the individual, as you mentioned and the will to power in a nation? - The will to power in an individual has a lot to do with\nindividual psychology. The story that I tell\nabout the pursuit of power, it a structural argument. It's an argument that says when you are in a particular structure, when you're in a system that\nhas a specific architecture, which is anarchy, the states have no choice\nbut to compete for power. So, structure is really\ndriving the story here. Will to power has a lot more\nto do with an individual in the Nietzsche story where\nthat concept comes from. So, it's very important to\nunderstand that I'm not arguing that states are inherently\naggressive, right? My point is that as long\nas states are in anarchy, they have no choice but to\nbehave in an aggressive fashion. But if you went to a hierarchic system, there's no reason for those states to worry about the balance of power, because if they get into trouble, there is a higher authority\nthat they can turn to. There is in effect a leviathan. - So, what is the role of military might in this will to power\non the national level? - Well, military mights is\nwhat ultimately matters, as I said to you before, the\ntwo building blocks of power are population size and wealth. - You didn't mention military mights? - I did not. No, that's right. And it's good that you caught that, because if you have a large population and you're a wealthy country, what you do is you build a large military and it's ultimately the size\nof your military that matters, because militaries fight wars. And if states are\nconcerned about survival, which I argue is the\nprinciple goal of every state in the international system for what I think are obvious reasons, then they're gonna care about\nhaving a powerful military that can protect them if\nanother state comes after them. - Well, it's not obvious\nthat a large nation with a lot of people and a lot of money, should necessarily build a gigantic army and seek to attain superpower, like dominant soul, superpower\nstatus to military might. But you're saying as\nyou see the world today, it has to be that way. - Yeah, I'm arguing it is obvious. If you're a state in the\ninternational system, do you wanna be weak if you\nlive next door to Nazi Germany or Imperial Germany, or Napoleonic France, or even the United States? The United States is a\nruthless great power. You surely recognize that. And if you're dealing with\nthe United States of America and you're Vladimir Putin, you wanna make sure you're\nas powerful as possible, so that the United States\ndoesn't put its gun sites on you and come after you. Same thing is true with China. You wanna be powerful in\nthe international system. States understand that and they go to great\nlengths to become powerful. Just take the United States of America when it started in 1783, it was comprised of 13 measly colonies, strung out along the Atlantic seaboard. Over time the various leaders of the United States went to great lengths to turn that country\ninto the dominant power in the Western hemisphere. And then once that was achieved in 1900, we've gone to great lengths to make sure that there's no peer\ncompetitor in the system. We just wanna make sure\nthat we're number one. And my argument is that this is not peculiar to the United States. If I'm China, for example, today I would want to dominate Asia, the way the United States\ndominates the Western hemisphere. They'd be fools not to. If I were imperial Germany, I'd want to dominate all of Europe the way the United States\ndominates the Western hemisphere. Why? Because if you dominate all of Europe, assuming you're Imperial\nGermany or Napoleonic France, then no other state in\nthe area or in the region can threaten you because\nyou're simply so powerful. And again, what I'm saying here is that the structure of the international\nsystem really matters. It's the fact that you're\nin this anarchic system where survival is your principle goal. And where I can't know\nyour intentions, right? You're another state. I can't know that at some point\nyou might not come after me. You might. And if you're really powerful and I'm not, I'm in deep trouble. - Yeah, so some of the ideas\non underlying what you've said, offensive realism, which I would love to talk to you about, sort of the history of\nrealism versus liberalism. But some of the ideas\nyou already mentioned, anarchy between states, everybody's trying to develop\na military capabilities, uncertainty, such an interesting concept. States cannot be sure that other states, will not use military\ncapabilities against them, which is one- - That's of enormous\nimportance to the story. - And so interesting, because you also say that this\nmakes realists more cautious and more peaceful, the uncertainty, because of all the\nuncertainty involved here, it's better to approach\ninternational politics with caution, which is really\ninteresting to think about, again, survival most states\ninterested in survival. And the other interesting thing is you assume all the states are rational, which- - Most of the time. - Most of the time. You call this framework offensive realism. Can you just give a overview\nof the history of the realism, versus liberalism debate as worldviews? - Well, I think for many centuries now, the big divide within the world of international relations theory is between realism and liberalism. These are time honored bodies of theory. And before I tell you what I think the differences are between those two bodies of theory, it is important to emphasize that there are differences among realists and differences among liberals. And so when you talk about\nme as an offensive realist, you should understand that there are also\ndefensive realists out there and there are a panoply of\nliberal theories as well. But basically, realists believe that power matters, that states compete for power and that war is an\ninstrument of statecraft. And liberals on the other hand, have what I would say is\na more idealistic view of the world. This is not to say that\nthey're naive or foolish, but they believe there are\naspects of international politics that lead to a less competitive and more peaceful world\nthan most realists see. And I'll lay out for you very quickly, what are the three major\nliberal theories today that I think will give you a sense of the more optimistic perspective that is inherent in\nthe liberal enterprise. The first and most important\nof the liberal theories is democratic peace theory. And this is a theory\nthat says democracies, do not fight against other democracies. So, the more the world is\npopulated with democracies, the less likely it is\nthat we will have wars. And this basic argument is inherent in Francis Fukuyama's\n\"The End of History.\" He argues that democracy\ntriumph first over fascism in the 20th century, it then triumphed over communism. And that means that in the future we're gonna have more and\nmore liberal democracies on the planet. And if you have more and\nmore liberal democracies and those democracies\ndon't fight each other, then you have a more peaceful world. That was his argument. It's a very liberal argument. A realist like me would say that it doesn't matter whether a state is a democracy or not, all states behave the same way, because the structure of the system, getting back to our earlier discussion, about international anarchy, the structure of the system\nleaves those states no choice, whether they're\ndemocracies or autocracies. And again, the liberal view, this first liberal theory is that democracies don't\nfight other democracies and therefore the more\ndemocracies you have, the more peaceful the world. - Can I just sort of try to\nunpack that a little bit? So, on the democratic peace theory, I guess would say that in\ndemocracies leaders are elected and the underlying assumption\nis most people want peace and so they will elect peacemakers. And so the more you democracies you have, the more likely you have peace. And then the realist perspective, says that it doesn't matter if the majority of people want peace, the structure of international politics is such that superpowers\nwant to become more super and powerful, and they\ndo that through war. - You can't make that argument that you're making about democracies, because if you're saying that democracies are inclined toward peace\nand that the picks leaders who are inclined towards peace, then you have to show that democracies are in\ngeneral more peaceful than non-democracies. And you can't support that argument. You can find lots of evidence\nto support the argument that democracies don't\nfight other democracies. So, the argument I believe\nthat you have to make, if you're gonna support\ndemocratic peace theory, the main argument you have to make is that liberal democracies\nhave a healthy respect for each other and they can\nassess each other's intentions. If you're a liberal democracy\nand I'm a liberal democracy, we know we have value systems\nthat argue against aggression and argue for peaceful\nresolution of crises. And therefore, given these\nnorms, we can trust each other, we can know each other's intentions. Remember for realists like me, uncertainty about intentions\nreally helps drive the train. But if you're talking\nabout two democracies, the argument there is that they know each other's intentions. - And for you, sure, maybe democracies reduce\nuncertainty a little bit, but not enough to stop the train. - I think that's right. Yeah, that's right. So, that's democratic peace theory. - [Lex] Yes. - The second theory is economic\ninterdependence theory. And that's the argument\nthat in a globalized world, like the one that we live in and have lived in for a long time, there's a great deal of\neconomic interdependence. And if you and I are two countries, or if you and me are two countries and we're economically interdependent and we're both getting prosperous as a result of this economic intercourse, the last thing that we're\ngonna do is start a war, either one of us, because who would kill the\ngoose that lays the golden eggs? It's that kind of argument. So, there you have an argument that economic interdependence\nleads to peace. And then the third liberal argument has to do with institutions, sometimes referred to as\nliberal institutionalism. And this is the argument that if you can get\nstates into institutions where they become rule abiding actors, they will obey the rules\nthat dictate that war is not acceptable. So, if you get them to accept the UN rules on when you can and cannot initiate a war, then you'll have a more peaceful world. So, those are the liberal theories and as you can tell, they're very different from realism as articulated by somebody like me. - Can you maybe argue against\nthe economic interdependence and in the institutions\nfollow rules a little bit? So, the golden goose with the golden egg, you're saying that nations\nare happy to kill the goose, because again, they want power. - If they think it's necessary\nto kill the golden goose, because of security\nconcerns, they will do it. The point is that economic\ninterdependence at its root has prosperity as the core variable. - Yeah. - In the realest story the\ncore variable is survival. And survival always trumps prosperity. So, if you go back to the\nperiod before World War I, we're in Europe, it's 1913 or early 1914, what you see is that you have an intense\nsecurity competition, between all of the great powers. On one side you have The Triple Alliance and on the other side you\nhave the Triple Entente. You have these two alliances, and you have an intense\nsecurity competition, between them, okay? At the same time, you have a great deal of\neconomic interdependence. It's amazing how much economic intercourse is taking place in Europe\namong all the actors, right? And people are getting prosperous. Our countries are getting\nprosperous as a result. But nevertheless, in the\nfamous July crisis of 1914, this economic prosperity is\nunable to prevent World War I, because security concerns or\nsurvival is more important. So, there are going to\nbe lots of situations where prosperity and\nsurvival come into conflict and in those cases, survival will win. - And maybe you can speak\nto the different camps of realists. You said offensive and defensive. Can you draw a distinction\nbetween those two? - Yeah, let me just back\nup a bit on that one. And you were talking about\nwill to power before. The first big divide between\nrealists is structural realists and human nature realists. - [Lex] Nice. - And Hans Morgenthau, who was influenced by nature and therefore had that will to power logic embedded in his thinking about\nhow the world works, right? He was a human nature realist, okay? I'm a structural realist and I believe it's not human nature. It's not individuals in some will to power that drives competition and war. What drives competition in war is the structure of the system. It's anarchy. - So, you're not as romantic\nas the human nature realists? - Yeah, there's just a world\nof difference between the two. - [Lex] Sure. It's just important to understand that. - So within that, from the structural that\nthere's a subdivision also of offensive and defensive? - Yes. Inside the structural\nrealist world, right? And you have a handful of realists who believe that the structure of the system fosters\ncompetition, for sure, security competition, but it really rules out great\npower war almost all the time. So, it makes sense to care\nabout the balance of power, but to focus on maintaining\nhow much power you have. That's the defensive realism, maintaining how much power you have, not trying to gain more power, because the argument the\ndefensive realists make is that if you try to gain more power, the system will punish you. The structure will punish you. I'm not a defensive realist,\nI'm an offensive realist. And my argument is that\nstates look for opportunities to gain more power. And every time they see or almost every time\nthey see an opportunity to gain more power and they think the\nlikelihood of success is high and the cost will not be great, they'll jump at that opportunity. - Just to linger on the\nhuman nature perspective, how do you explain\nHitler and Nazi Germany, just one of the more recent\naggressive expansions, through military might? How do you explain that in the framework of offensive realism? - Well, I think that Nazi\nGermany was driven in large part by structural considerations. And I think if you look\nat Imperial Germany, which was largely responsible\nfor starting World War I and of course Nazi Germany's\nlargely responsible for starting World War II, what that tells you is you\ndidn't need Adolf Hitler to start World War I, right? And I believe that there is a good chance you would've had World War II in the absence of Hitler, right? I believe that Germany was very powerful, it was deeply worried about\nthe balance of power in Europe, and it had strong incentives\nto behave aggressively in the late 1930s, early 1940s. So, I believe that structure mattered. However, I want to qualify that\nin the case of Adolf Hitler, because I do think he\nhad what you would call a will to power. I've never used that word\nto describe him before, but it's consistent with\nmy point that I often make, that there are two leaders or there have been two\nleaders in modern history who are congenital aggressors, and one was Napoleon and\nthe other was Hitler. Now, if you wanna call\nthat a will to power, you can do that. I'm more comfortable referring to Hitler as a congenital aggressor and referring to Napoleon\nas a congenital aggressor. Although there were important\ndifferences between the two, because Hitler was probably the most murderous leader\nin recorded history, and Napoleon was not in\nthat category at all. But both of them were driven by what you would call a will to power. And that has to be married\nto the structural argument in Hitler's case and\nalso in Napoleon's case. - Is there some degree on the human psychology\nside that resentment, because of what happened\nafter World War I, led to Hitler wooly so much power and then Hitler starting World War II. So, this is the human side. Perhaps the reason I asked that question is also because you mentioned\nthe century of humiliation on the China side. So, to which degree did\nhumiliation lead to Hitler and lead to World War II? - Well, the question of what led to Hitler is a very different question than the question of\nwhat led to World War II, once Hitler was in power. I mean, after January\n30th, 1933, he's in power. And in the question of what is driving him\ncomes racing to the fore, is there resentment over\nthe Versailles Treaty and what happened to Germany? Yes. Did that matter? Yes. But my argument is that structure was the principle factor driving\nthe train in Hitler's case. But what I'm saying here is that there were other factors as well, resentment being one\nof them, will to power or the fact that he was\na congenital aggressor in my lexicon, certainly mattered as well. So, I don't want to dismiss\nyour point about resentment. - So, Hitler in particular, the way he wielded, the way he gained so much power, might have been the general\nresentment of the populace, of the German populace? - I think that as a result\nof defeat in World War I and all the trials and\ntribulations associated with Weimar Germany and then the coming of\nthe Great Depression, all of those factors definitely account for his coming to power. I think that one of the reasons that he was so successful at\nwinning over the German people, once he came to power, was because there was a\ngreat deal of resentment in the German body politic. And he played on that resentment that surely helped him get elected too. But I think having studied the case, it was even more important\nonce he took over. I also believe that one\nof the principle reasons that he was so popular and he was wildly popular\ninside Nazi Germany, is because he was the only leader of an industrialized country who pulled his country\noutta the depression. And that really mattered and\nit made him very effective. It's also worth noting that he was a remarkably\ncharismatic individual. I find that hard to believe, 'cause every time I look at\nhim or listen to his speeches, he does not appear to\nbe charismatic to me. But I've talked to a number of people who are experts on this subject who assure me that he\nwas very charismatic. And I would note to you, if you look at public\nopinion polls in Germany, west Germany in the late 1940s, this is the late 1940s after\nthe Third Reich is destroyed in 1945, he's still remarkably\npopular in the polls. - Stalin is still popular in\nmany parts of Eastern Europe. - Yeah, yeah. And Stalin's popular in many quarters, inside Russia and Stalin\nmurdered more of his own people than he murdered people\noutside of the Soviet Union. - And still to you, the ties of history\nturned not on individuals, but on structural considerations. So, Hitler may be a surface layer, characteristics of how\nGermany started war, but not the really, the reason. - Well, history is a\nmultidimensional phenomenon. - [Lex] So I hear. - We're talking about\ninterstate relations here. - [Lex] Yes. - And realism is a theory\nabout how states interact with each other. And there are many other dimensions to international politics. And if you're talking, about someone like Adolf Hitler, right? Why did he start World War II is a very different question than why did he start the Holocaust or why did he push forward a Holocaust? I mean, that's a different question. And realism doesn't answer that question. So, I want to be very clear that, I'm not someone who argues\nthat realism answers, every question about\ninternational politics, but it does answer what is one of the big, if not the biggest questions\nthat IR scholars care about, which is what causes security competition and what causes great power war. - Does offensive realism answer the question why Hitler\nattacked the Soviet Union? - [John] Yes. - Because from a military\nstrategy perspective, there's pros and cons to that decision. - Pros and cons to every decision. The question is, did he think that he could win\na quick and decisive victory? And he did. I mean, as did his generals,\nit's very interesting. I've spent a lot of time\nstudying German decision making. In World War II if you look at the German decision to invade Poland on September 1st, 1939 and you look at the German\ndecision invade France on May 10th, 1940 and then the Soviet\nUnion on June 22nd, 1941, what you see is there was\nactually quite a bit of resistance to Hitler in 1938 at the time\nof Czechoslovakia Munich. And there was also quite\na bit of resistance in September, 1939. - Internally or you mean- - Internally, internally for sure, yeah. Yeah people had doubts. They didn't think the Weimar was ready. And given the fact that World War I had just ended about 20 years before the thought of starting\nanother European War was not especially attractive to lots of German policy makers,\nincluding military leaders. And then came France 1940 in\nthe run up to May 10th, 1940, there was huge resistance in the German army to attacking France. But that was eventually eliminated, because they came up with a clever plan, the Manstein Plan. If you look at the decision\nto invade the Soviet Union on June 22nd, 1941, which is the only case where they fail, they succeeded in France,\nthey succeeded in Poland, they succeeded at Munich in 1938. Soviet Union is where they fail. There's hardly any\nresistance at all, right? - Yeah, well, and to say that\nthey failed the Soviet Union, I mean, my grandfather fought, I mean, I'm from the Soviet Union, there's a lot of successes early on. So, there's poor military, I would say strategic\ndecisions along the way, but it caught Stalin off guard. Maybe you can correct me, but from my perspective, terrifyingly so they\ncould have been successful if certain different decisions were made from a military perspective. - Yeah, I've always had the sense they came terrifyingly close to winning. - [Lex] Yeah. - You can make the opposite argument that they were doomed. But I'm not terribly comfortable\nmaking that argument. I think the Weimar by the summer of 1941 was a finely tuned instrument for war. And the Red Army was in\nquite terrible shape. Stalin had purged the Officer Corps, they had performed poorly in Finland and there were all sorts of reasons to think that they were no\nmatch for the match for Weimar. And if you look at what happened in the initial stages of the conflict, that proved to be the case. The Germans won a lot of significant tactical\nvictories early on. - And if they focused and went to Moscow as quickly as possible,\nis again, terrifyingly, so could have been a, basically topple Stalin. And one thing that's- - [John] That's possible.\n- That's possible. - Fortunately we're not gonna\nrun the experiment again, but one could argue that\nhad they concentrated as the generals wanted to do\nin going straight from Moscow, that they would've won. I mean, what Hitler wanted to do is he wanted to go into the Ukraine. I mean, Hitler thought that the main axis, there were three axis, the northern axis went towards Leningrad, the central axis of course went to Moscow, and then the southern axis, Army Group south headed towards Ukraine and deep into the Caucasus. And Hitler believed that\nshould have been the main axis. And in fact, in 1942,\nthe Soviets, excuse me, the Germans go back on\nthe offensive in 1942. This is Operation Blue, and the main axis in '42\nis deep into the Ukraine and into the Caucasus. And that fails. But one could argue that\nhad they done that in '41, had they not gone to\nMoscow, had they gone, had they concentrated on\ngoing deep into Ukraine and into the Caucasus, they could have knocked\nthe Soviets out that way. I'm not sure that in\nthe end, I believe that. I think in the end, the Soviets\nwould've won no matter what. But I'm not a hundred\npercent sure of that. - So, sometimes maybe you can educate me, but so sometimes they say, just like with Napoleon winter\ndefeated Hitler in Russia. I think not often enough\npeople tell the story of the soldiers and the motivation\nand how hard they fight. So, it turns out that\nUkrainians and Russians are not easy to conquer. They're the kinds of\npeople that don't roll over and fight bravely. There seems to be a\ndifference in certain people, peoples in how they see war, how they approach war, how proud they are to\nfight for their country, to die for their country,\nthese kinds of things. So, I think Battle of Stalingrad tells, at least to me, a story of\nextremely brave fighting on the Soviet side, and that it's a component of war too. It's not just structural, it's not just military strategy, it's also the humans involved. But maybe that's a romantic notion of war. - No, I think there's a\ngreat deal of truth in that, but let's just unpack it a bit in the case of the Soviet\nUnion in World War II, the counterargument to that\nis that in World War I, the Russian Army disintegrated. And if you look at what\nhappened when Napoleon, invaded in 1812, and you look at what happened in 1917 and then you look at what\nhappened between '41 and '45, the Napoleon case looks a\nlot like the Hitler case, and it fits neatly with your argument. But World War I does not fit\nneatly with your argument, because the Russians lost and surrendered. And you had the infamous\nTreaty of Brest-Litovsk, where the Soviet Union then, 'cause it went from\nRussia to the Soviet Union in October, 1917, the Soviet Union surrendered large amounts of Soviet territory, because it had suffered\na humiliating defeat. My argument for why the\nRussians, let me take that back, why the Soviets fought like\nwild dogs in World War II is that they were up against\nthe genocidal adversary. You wanna understand that the\nGermans murdered huge numbers of Soviet POWs. The overall total was 3.7 million. And by December of 1941, remember the invasion is June 41. By December of 1941, the Germans have murdered\n2 million Soviet POWs. At that point in time, they had murdered many more POWs than they had murdered Jews. And this is not to deny for one second that they were on a murderous\nrampage when it came to Jews, but they were also on a murderous rampage when it came to Soviet citizens\nand Soviet soldiers, right? So, those Soviet soldiers\nquickly came to understand they were fighting for their lives. If they were taken\nprisoner, they would die. So, they fought like wild dogs. - Yeah, the story of the Holocaust, of the 6 million Jews is\noften told extensively, if Hitler won, conquer the Soviet Union, it's terrifying to think\non a much grander scam than the Holocaust. What would've happened\nto the Slavic people, to the Soviet people? - Absolutely. All you have to do is read\nthe Hunger Plan, right? And they also had a\nplan, what was it called? Generalplan Ost, I forget\nthe exact name of it, which made it clear that they were gonna murder\nmany tens of millions of people. And by the way, I believe that they would've\nmurdered all the Poles and all the Roma. I mean, my view is that\nthe Jews were number one on the genocidal hit list. The Roma or the Gypsies were number two and the Poles were number three. And of course, I just explained to you how\nmany POWs they had killed. So, they would've ended\nup murdering huge numbers of Soviet citizens as well. But people quickly figured\nout that this was happening. That's my point to you. And that gave them, needless to say, very powerful incentives to\nfight hard against the Germans and to make sure that they did not win. - To fast forward in\ntime, but not in space. Let me ask you about the war in Ukraine. Why did Russia invade Ukraine\non February 24th, 2022? What are some of the explanations given and which do you find the most convincing? - Well, clearly the conventional\nwisdom is that Putin is principally responsible. Putin is an imperialist,\nhe's an expansionist. - That's the conventional thinking. - Yeah, yeah. And the idea is that he is bent on creating a greater Russia and even more so he's interested in dominating Eastern\nEurope, if not all of Europe. And that Ukraine was the\nfirst stop on the train line. And what he wanted to do was\nto conquer all of Ukraine incorporated into a greater Russia and then he would move on\nand conquer other countries. This is the conventional wisdom. My view is there is no evidence, let me emphasize, zero evidence\nto support that argument. - Which part that he would, the imperialist part,\nthe sense that he would, he sought to conquer all of\nUkraine and move on and conquer. - There's no evidence he was interested in conquering all of Ukraine. There's no evidence beforehand that he was interested in coning\nconquering any of Ukraine. And there's no way that an army that had 190,000 troops at the most, could have conquered all of Ukraine. Just impossible. As I like to emphasize, when the Germans went into Poland in 1939 and the Germans you wanna remember were only intent on conquering\nthe western half of Poland, because the Soviets who\ncame in later that month were gonna conquer the\neastern half of Poland. So, the western half of Poland\nis much smaller than Ukraine. And the Germans went in\nwith 1.5 million troops. If Vladimir Putin were bent\non conquering all of Ukraine, he would've needed at\nleast 2 million troops. I would argue he'd need 3 million troops, because not only did he\nneed to conquer the country, he would then have to occupy it. But the idea that 190,000\ntroops was sufficient for conquering all of Ukraine\nis not a serious argument. Furthermore, he was not\ninterested in conquering Ukraine. And that's why in March, 2022, this is immediately after the war starts, he is negotiating with\nZelensky to end the war. There are serious\nnegotiations taking place in Istanbul involving the Turks. And Naftali Bennett, who was the Israeli prime\nminister at the time, was deeply involved in negotiating with both Putin and\nZelensky to end the war. Well, if he was interested Putin in conquering all of Ukraine, why in God's name would he be negotiating with Zelensky to end the war? And of course, what they were negotiating\nabout was NATO expansion into Ukraine, which was the principle cause of the war. People in the West don't\nwant to hear that argument, because if it is true, which it is then the West\nis principally responsible for this bloodbath\nthat's now taking place. And of course, the West doesn't want to\nbe principally responsible. It wants to blame Vladimir Putin. So, we've invented this\nstory out of whole cloth, that he is an aggressor, that he's the second\ncoming of Adolf Hitler. And that what he did in Ukraine was try to conquer all of it. And he failed. But with a little bit of luck, he probably would've conquered all of it. And he'd now be in the Baltic states and eventually end up dominating\nall of Eastern Europe. As I said, I think there's\nno evidence to support this. - So, maybe there's a lot\nof things to ask there. Maybe just to linger on NATO expansion, what is NATO expansion? What is the threat of NATO expansion and why is this such a concern for Russia? - NATO was a mortal enemy\nof the Soviet Union, during the Cold War. It's a military alliance which has at its heart the\nUnited States of America, which is the most powerful\nstate on the planet. It is perfectly understandable that Russia is not going to want\nthat military alliance on its doorstep. Here in the United States we have, as you well know, what's called the Monroe Doctrine. And that basically says, no great powers from Europe or Asia are allowed to come into our neighborhood and form a military alliance with anybody in this neighborhood. When I was young, there was this thing called\nthe Cuban Missile Crisis. The Soviets had the audacity to put nuclear armed missiles in Cuba. We told them in no uncertain terms that that was not acceptable and that those missiles had to be removed. This is our backyard and we do not tolerate\ndistant great powers, coming into our neighborhood. Well, what's good for the\ngoose, it's good for the gander. And if we don't like great powers, coming into our neighborhood,\nit's hardly surprising that the Russians did not\nwant NATO on their doorstep. They made that manifestly\nclear when the Cold War ended and they exacted a promise from us that we would not expand NATO. And then when we started expanding NATO, they made it clear after\nthe first tranche in 1999 that they were profoundly\nunhappy with that. They made it clear in 2004\nafter the second tranche that they were profoundly\nunhappy with that expansion. And then in April, 2008, when NATO announced that\nUkraine and Georgia, would become part of NATO, they made it unequivocally clear, not just Putin, that was not gonna happen. They were drawing a red line in the sand. And it is no accident\nthat in August, 2008, remember the Bucharest\nSummit is April, 2008 and August, 2008, you had a\nwar between Georgia and Russia. And that involved at its\ncore in NATO expansion. So, the Americans and their\nallies should have understood by at least August, 2008, that continuing to push\nto bring Ukraine into NATO was going to lead to disaster. And I would note that there\nwere all sorts of people in the 1990s like George\nKennon, William Perry, who was Bill Clinton's\nSecretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint\nChiefs of Staff, Paul Nitsa and so forth and so on, who argued that NATO expansion, would end up producing a\ndisaster, which it has. I would note that at the famous\nApril, 2008 Bucharest Summit where NATO said that Ukraine, would be brought into the alliance, Angela Merkel and Nicholas Sarkozy, the German and French\nleaders respectively, opposed that decision. Angela Merkel later said that\nthe reason she opposed it was because she understood\nthat Putin would interpret it as a declaration of war. Just think about that. Merkel is telling you that\nshe opposed NATO expansion into Ukraine because\nshe understood correctly that Putin would see it\nas a declaration of war. What did the United States and its friends in Europe do? They continued to push and push, because we thought that we\ncould push NATO expansion, down their throat, after 2008 the same way\nwe did in 1999 and 2004. But we were wrong. And it all blew up in our face in 2014. And when it blew up in our\nface in 2014, what did we do? Did we back off and say, \"Well, maybe the Russians, \"have some legitimate security interest?\" No, that's not the way we operate. We continued to double down and the end result is that\nin 2022 you got a war. And as I've argued for a long time now, we, the West are principally\nresponsible for that, not Vladimir Putin. - So, the expansion of NATO is primarily responsible for that. - Yeah, to put it in more general terms, what we were trying to do was turn Ukraine into a Western bulwark on Russia's border. And it really wasn't NATO expansion alone. NATO expansion was the\nmost important element of our strategy. But the strategy had two other dimensions. One was EU expansion and the third was the color revolution. We were trying to force\nOrange Revolution in Ukraine. And the basic goal there was to turn Ukraine into a\npro-Western liberal democracy. And that meant that you'd\nhave Ukraine if it worked as a pro-Western liberal democracy. That was in the EU and that was in NATO. This was our goal. And the Russians made\nit unequivocally clear, Ukraine was not gonna\nbecome a Western bulwark on their border. And most importantly, they made it clear that Ukraine\nin NATO was unacceptable. - Can we talk about the\nmind of Vladimir Putin? You've mentioned that this\nidea that he has aspirations for imperialist conquest, that he dreams of empire\nis not grounded in reality. He wrote an essay in\n2021, about one people. Do you think there is some degree to which he still dreams of the former Soviet Union reuniting? - No, he's made it clear that anybody with a triple digit IQ understands that it's nuts to think about\nrecreating the Soviet Union. He thinks it's a tragedy that\nthe Soviet Union fell apart. But as he made clear in that essay, the July 12th, 2021 essay. And has he made clear in speeches before, immediately before he invaded Ukraine, he accepted the breakup\nof the Soviet Union and he accepted the status quo in Europe. Say for the fact he did not accept the idea that Ukraine\nwould become part of NATO. - He's been in power for over two decades. Is there a degree that power\ncan affect a leader's ability to see the world clearly,\nas they say corrupt? Do you think power has corrupted\nVladimir Putin to a degree? - It's very hard for me\nto answer that question, 'cause I don't know him, and I've not studied him carefully in terms of his overall performance, over the course of the 23\nyears that he's been in power, I've studied him as a strategist and I've studied how\nhe deals with the West and deals with the international\nsystem more generally, since 2014. And I think he is a\nfirst class strategist. This is not to say he\ndoesn't make mistakes and he admits he's made some mistakes. But I think that the West is dealing with a\nformidable adversary here. And I don't see any evidence that he's either lost\nspeed off his fastball or that power has corrupted his thinking, about strategic affairs. - So, he has consistently put as a primary concern security, as does the United States, he's put for Russia's security, making sure that NATO doesn't\nget close to its borders. - I think that's clear. Yeah, I think as I emphasized\nearly on in our conversation, that leaders privilege\nsecurity or survival, over everything else. And by the way, he gave a number of talks and press conferences\nin addition to writing that famous article that you\nreferred to on July 12th, 2021. So, we have a pretty clear\nrecord of what he was saying, and I would argue what he was thinking in the runup to the war in February, 2022. And if you read what he said, it's quite clear that he\nprivileged security or survival, he was deeply concerned\nabout the security of Russia. And Russia is a quite vulnerable\nstate in a lot of ways, especially if you think back to what it looked like in the 1990s, as you know better than I do, it was in terrible shape. The Chinese talk about the\nCentury of National Humiliation. One could argue that for the Russians, that was the Decade of\nNational Humiliation. And, and it took Putin, I\nthink, quite a bit of time to bring the Russians back from the dead. I think he eventually succeeded, but it took a considerable amount of time. And I think he understood that he was not playing a\nparticularly strong hand. He was playing something of a weak hand and he had to be very\ncareful, very cautious. And I think he was, and I think that's very\ndifferent than the United States. The United States was the unipole, it was the most powerful state\nin the history of the world, most powerful state relative\nto all its possible competitors from roughly 1989, certainly after December, 1991 when the Soviet Union fell apart. Up until I would argue about 2017, we were incredibly powerful. And even after 2017 up to today, the United States remains\nthe most powerful state in the system. And because of our geographical location, we are in a terrific situation to survive in any great power competition. So, you have a situation\ninvolving the United States that's different than the\nsituation involving Russia. They're just much more\nvulnerable than we are. And therefore, I think Putin tends to be\nmore sensitive about security than any American\npresident in recent times. - Europe on one side,\nChina on the other side. It's a complicated situation. - Yeah and we talked before about 1812 when Napoleon invaded and\nMoscow got burned to the ground. We talked about World War I, where the Russians were actually\ndefeated and surrendered. And then we talked about 1941 to 1945, although thankfully the Soviets prevailed, it was a close call. And I mean, the casualties, the destruction that the\nSoviet Union had inflicted on it by the Germans is\njust almost hard to believe. Just so they are sensitive, you can understand full well or at least you should be\nable to understand full well why the idea of bringing\nUkraine up to their border, really spooked them. I don't understand why more\nAmericans don't understand that. It befuddles me. I think it has to do with the fact that Americans are not very\ngood at putting themselves in the shoes of other countries. And you really, if you're gonna be a\nfirst class strategist in international politics, you have to be able to do that. You have to put yourself in\nthe shoes of the other side and think about how they think, so you don't make foolish mistakes. - And as a starting point, Americans tend to see\nthemselves as the good guys and a set of others as the bad guys. And you have to be able to empathize that Russians think of\nthemselves as the good guys. The Chinese think of\nthemselves as the good guys and just be able to empathize\nif they are the good guys. It's like that funny skit,\n\"Are We The Baddies?\" Consider the United States\ncould be the bad guys, like first of all, like see the world if the\nUnited States is the bad guys and China is the good guys,\nwhat does that world look like? Be able to just exist with that thought, because that is what\nthe Chinese leadership and many Chinese citizens, if not now, maybe in\nthe future will believe. And you have to kind\nof do the calculation, the simulation forward from that. And same with Russia, same\nwith with other nations. - Yeah, I agree with\nyou a hundred percent. And just, I always think of\nMichael McFall at Stanford, who was the American ambassador to Russia, I think between 2012 and 2014. And he told me that he told Putin that Putin didn't have to\nworry about NATO expansion, because the United States\nwas a benign hegemony. And I asked Mike what\nPutin's response was to that. And Mike said that\nPutin didn't believe it, but Mike believed that\nhe should believe it and that we could move NATO\neastward to include Ukraine and in the end we'd get away with it, because we are a benign hegemony. But the fact is, that's\nnot what Putin saw. Putin saw us as a malign hegemony. And what Mike thinks or any\nAmerican thinks, doesn't matter. What matters is what Putin thinks. - But also the drums of\nwar have been beating for some reason. NATO expansion has been\nthreatened for some reason. So, you've talked about\nNATO expansion being dead, so like it doesn't make sense from a geopolitical\nperspective on the Europe side to expand NATO, but nevertheless that\nthreat has been echoed. So, why has NATO expansion been pushed from your perspective? - There are two reasons. One is, first of all, we thought it was a wonderful thing to bring more and more\ncountries in to NATO. We thought that it facilitated\npeace and prosperity. It was ultimately all for the good. And we also thought that, countries like Ukraine\nhad a right to join NATO. These are sovereign countries\nthat can decide for themselves and the Russians have no say\nin what Ukraine wants to do. And then finally, and this is a point I emphasized before, we were very powerful and we thought we could\nshove it down their throat. So, it's a combination of those factors that led us to pursue what I think was ultimately\na foolish policy. - We've talked about how wars get started. How do you hope the war in Ukraine ends? What are the ways to end this war? What are the ways to achieve\npeace there to end the, I would say senseless death of young men as always happens in war? - I'm sad to say I don't\nhave a good answer to that. I don't think there's any real prospect of a meaningful peace agreement. I think it's almost impossible. I think the best you can\nhope for at this point is at some point in the shooting\nstops, you have ceasefire and then you have a frozen conflict. And that frozen conflict\nwill not be highly stable. And the Ukrainians in the west\nwill do everything they can to weaken Russia's position and the Russians will go to great lengths to not only damage that\ndysfunctional rum state that Ukraine becomes, but the Russians will go to great lengths to sow dissension within the alliance. And that includes in terms\nof transatlantic relations. So, you'll have this continuing\nsecurity competition, between Russia on one side and Ukraine and the West on the other. Even when you get a frozen piece and or you get a frozen conflict and the potential for\nescalation there will be great. So, I think this is a disaster. - That's a very realist perspective. Let me ask you sort of\nthe human side of it. Do you think there's some\npower to leaders sitting down, having a conversation, man to man, leader to leader about this? There's is just a lot of death happening. It seems that from a economic perspective from a historic perspective, from a human perspective\nboth nations are losing. Is it possible for Vladimir Zelensky and Vladimir Putin to sit down and talk and to figure out a way where the security concerns\nare addressed and both nations can minimize the amount of\nsuffering that's happening and create a path towards\nfuture flourishing? - I think the answer is no. - Even with United States involved, three people in the room. - Well, I think if the\nUnited States is involved, the answer's definitely no. You have to get the Americans out. And then I think if you have\nZelensky and Putin talking, you have a sliver of a chance there. The Americans are a real problem. Look, let's go back to what happens right after\nthe war starts, okay? Because I said before, we're talking March, early April of 2022. The war starts on February 24th, 2022. And as I said to you, the two sides were negotiating in Istanbul and they were also negotiating\nthrough Naftali Bennett and the Bennett track\nand the Turkish track were operating together. I mean, they were not at\ncross purposes at all. What happened? Bennett tells the story very clearly that they had made significant progress in reaching an agreement. This is Zelensky on one\nside and Putin on the other. Bennett is talking in person\nto both Putin and Zelensky and what happens to produce failure. The answer is the United\nStates and Britain get involved and tell Zelensky to walk. They tell Zelensky to walk. If they had come in\nand encouraged Zelensky to try to figure out a way with\nPutin to shut this one down and worked with Bennett\nand worked with Erdogan, we might've been able to\nshut the war down then. But it was the United States. - Well, let me sort of push back on that. You're correct, but sort of United States\npaints this like picture that everybody's aligned. So, maybe you can correct me, but I believe in the power of individuals, especially individual leaders. Again, whether it's Biden\nor Trump or whoever, goes into a room and says\nin a way that's convincing that no more NATO expansion. And actually just on a basic human level, ask the question of why are we doing all this senseless killing? And look at the interest of one Russia, look at the interest of the other Ukraine. Their interests are pretty simple. And say, United States is\ngonna stay out of this. We're not going to expand NATO and say all that in a\nway that's convincing, which is, NATO expansion\nis silly at this point. China's the big threat. We're not going to do this\nkind of conflict escalation with Russia. The Cold War's over,\nlet's normalize relations. - Well, let me just embellish\nyour argument, okay? - Thank you. - I need it. - If we say there's a sliver of a chance that you can do this, and I do think there is\na sliver of a chance. Let me just embellish your point. - [Lex] Thank you, I need\nall the help I can get. - Two things have to be\ndone here in my opinion. One is Ukraine has to become neutral and it it has to completely\nsever all security ties with the West, right? It's not like you can say\nwe're not gonna expand NATO to include Ukraine, but we're going to continue to have some loose security\narrangement with Ukraine. None of that has to be completely severed. Ukraine has to be on its own, okay? And number two, Ukraine has to accept the fact that the Russians are\ngonna keep the four oblast that they've now annexed in Crimea, right? The Russians are not gonna give them back. And what you really want\nto do if you're Zelensky or who's ever running\nUkraine in this scenario that we're positing, is you wanna make sure the Russians, don't take another four oblast to include Kyiv and Odessa, right? If I'm playing Putin's\nhand and this war goes on, I'm thinking about\ntaking four more oblast. I want to take about 43% of Ukraine and Annex to Russia, right? And I certainly want Odessa\nand I certainly want Kiev and I want the two oblast\nin between as well, right? - Literally, or as leverage in negotiation for Ukraine neutrality. - I want them literally I want\nto conquer them literally. But my point to you is if we can begin to talk\nabout cutting a deal now, you may be able to head\nthat kind of aggression off at the pass. In other words, you may be able to limit Putin and Russia to annexing the four oblasts that they've now annexed plus Crimea. That's the best I think you can hope for. But the point is you have to get the Ukrainians to accept that, you have to get the Ukrainians to accept becoming a truly neutral state and conceding that the Russians keep a big chunk of territory. It's about 23% of Ukrainian\nterritory that they've annexed. And I find it hard to imagine, any Ukrainian leader agreeing to that. - Well, there could be\nmore nuanced things like, no military involvement, between the United States and Ukraine, but economic involvement, sort of financial support, sort of normalizing economic\nrelationships with Ukraine, with Russia, all being. - I think you could\nprobably get away with that. I think that the tricky question there that you would have to answer is what about EU expansion, right? And I think EU expansion is probably a no-no for the Russians, because most people don't recognize this. But there is a military dimension\nbuilt into EU expansion. It's not purely an economic alliance or relationship or institution, whatever word you want to use. There's a military dimension to that. And in the runup to the World War, actually in the runup to the 2014 crisis, when it first broke out, the Russians made it clear\nthey saw EU expansion as a stalking horse for NATO expansion. So, EU expansion is tricky, but I think your point of close\neconomic relations between or healthy economic relations to use a better term between Ukraine and the West is possible. I think the Russians\nhave a vested interest if it's a neutral Ukraine, they have a vested interest\nin that Ukraine flourishing. But that then brings us, back to the territorial issue, right? - Well, so do you believe it's possible for individual human\nrelations to counteract the structural forces that you talk about? So, meaning the leaders being\nable to pick up the phone and make agreements that are\ngood for humanity as a whole and for their individual\nnations in the long term? - I think leadership matters here. I mean, one of the real problems here is that there's no trust\nand on the Russian side, and that has to do with\nthe Minsk Agreements. The Minsk Agreements, which were designed to\nshut down the civil war in eastern Ukraine in the Donbas, really mattered to the Russians. And there were four players\ninvolved in the Minsky process. Four main players, Russia and Ukraine of course\nand then Germany and France. And I believe the Russians took\nthe Minsk Accord seriously. I believe Putin took them very seriously. He wanted to shut down that conflict. And Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande, he was the French leader, and Poroshenko who was\nthe Ukrainian leader, those were the three key\nplayers besides Putin. Again, Hollande from\nFrance, Merkel from Germany, and Poroshenko from Ukraine\nhave all explicitly said they were not seriously interested\nin reaching an agreement in all of the discussions with Putin, they were bamboozling him. They were trying to trick him, so that they would buy time to\nbuild up Ukraine's military. Putin is profoundly upset\nabout these admissions by these three leaders. He believes he was fooled into thinking that Minsk could work. He believes that he\nnegotiated in good faith and they did not. And he believes that the level\nof trust now between Russia and the West is virtually zero as a result of this experience over Minsk. I only bring this up because\nit cuts against your argument that leaders could pick up the\nphone and talk to each other and trust each other at least somewhat to work out a meaningful deal. If you're Putin at this point in time, trusting the West is not an idea that's gonna be very attractive at all. In fact, you're gonna\ndistrust anything they say. - Yeah, distrust anything the West say. But there is individual humans. The way human nature works is when you're sitting\nacross from a person, you can trust a human being, while still distrusting the West. I mean, I believe in the power of that. I think with the right leaders, you could sit down and talk, like override the general\nstructural distrust of the West and say, you know what? I like this guy or gal, whatever. I do hope Zelensky and\nPutin sit down together and talk, have multiple talks. - Just remember they\nwere doing that in March and the Americans came in\nand the British came in. - [Lex] Yeah. - And they scotched a potential deal. - Well, the other beautiful\nthing about human nature, there's forgiveness and\nthere's trying, again, - When you're the leader of a country in an Antarctic system, you have to be very careful\nnot to let your trust in a foreign leader take you too far. Because if that foreign leader betrays you or betrays your trust and stabbed you in the\nback, you could die. And again, you wanna remember that the principal\nresponsibility of any leader, I don't care what country it is, is to ensure the survival of their state. And that means that, trust is only gonna buy you so much. And when you've already\nbetrayed the trust of a leader, you really are not gonna be\nable to rely on trust very much to help you moving forward. Now, you disagree with that? I hope you're right and if they can shut down\nthe Ukraine-Russia war, it would be wonderful. If I'm proved dead wrong,\nthat would be wonderful news. My prediction that this war is gonna go on for a long time and end in an ugly way, is a prediction that I don't like it all. So, I hope I'm wrong. - You wrote that many in the West believe that the best hope for\nending the Ukraine war is to remove Vladimir Putin from power. But you argue that this isn't the case. Can you explain? - Well, a lot of people thought when they were having all that trouble, the Russians were having all\nthat trouble with Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\nthat Putin was vulnerable and was likely to be overthrown. And what would happen is a peace-loving leader\nwould replace Putin. I made two points at the time and I would make those same two points. Now, number one, he's not likely to be overthrown. He was not likely then to be overthrown. And I think as long as\nhis health holds up, I think he will remain in power. My second point is, if he doesn't remain in\npower and he's replaced, I would bet a lot of money that his replacement will be more hawkish and more hard line than Putin is. I actually think one\ncould argue that Putin was too trusting of the\nWest before the war started. And number two, I think one could argue that he has not waged the war\nagainst Ukraine as vigorously as one might have expected. He was slow to mobilize\nthe nation for war, and he has pursued a limited war in all sorts of ways. The Israelis for example, have killed more civilians\nin Gaza in one month than the Russians have killed\nover 18 months in Ukraine. The idea that Vladimir Putin\nis waging a punishment campaign and killing on purpose, large numbers of civilians\nis simply not true. All this is to say that I would imagine that if Putin leaves office and someone else comes in to replace him, that someone else will be at least if not more hard line than\nhim, in terms of waging the war and certainly will not trust\nthe West any more than he has. - By way of advice. Let me ask you, if I were to have a conversation\ninterview Vladimir Putin and Zelensky individually, what should I ask them? If you, me and Vladimir\nPutin are having a chat, what are good ideas to explore? What are good questions to ask? What are good things to say\non or off the mic once again, that could potentially even slightly, less than the amount of\nsuffering in the world, caused by this war. - Oh, I think if you get an\ninterview with Vladimir Putin, there's just all sorts of\nquestions you could ask him. And my sense is that Putin\nis a straight shooter. He's also very knowledgeable about history and he has simple theories in his head, about how the world works. And I think he would level with you and all you would've to\ndo is just figure out what all the right questions are. And that would not be hard to do, right? You could ask him why was he so foolish? This is for example, why was he so foolish\nas to trust Poroshenko Hollande and Merkel in the Minsk accords. Why after his famous\ntalk at Munich in 2007 where he made it clear that he\nwas so unhappy with the West, did he continue to in a very\nimportant way trust the West? Why didn't he mobilize\nthe Russian military, before late September, 2022? Once the negotiations that\nwe were talking about, before involving Istanbul\nand Naftali Bennett, and once they broke down why didn't he immediately mobilize, more of the Russian\npopulation to fight the war? It just all sorts of questions like that. And then you could ask him questions about where he sees this one headed. What's the best strategy for Russia if the Ukrainians will not\nagree to neutrality, right? People like John Mearsheimer say, you'll probably take\nclose to half of Ukraine. Is that true? Does it make sense to take Odessa? - And John Mearsheimer also\nhas questions about China, your future relationships with China. - Yeah, I mean, one\nreally important question that I would ask him is if the United States had\nbasically not driven you into the arms of the Chinese, if there had been no war over Ukraine and the United States and its European allies had\ngone to considerable lengths to create some sort of\nsecurity architecture in Europe that resulted in you Vladimir Putin, having good relations with Ukraine, what would your relations with China be? And how would you think about that? So, there are just plenty of\nquestions you could ask him. - Well, hope burns eternal in my heart. I think probably in Putin's\nheart and Zelensky he's heart, I hope because hope is the leap of trust that we've talked about, I think is necessary for\ndeescalation and for peace. - Well, you realize I have\nfrom the beginning argued for different policies that were all designed to prevent this war from ever happening. - [Lex] Yes, yes. - I don't know if you know this, but in 1993, I argued\nthat Ukraine should keep its nuclear weapons. I was probably the only person in the West who made that argument. And my argument in 1993,\nthis is in foreign affairs, was that there may come the day when Russia thinks about invading Ukraine. And should that day come,\nit would be very helpful for preventing war if\nUkraine had nuclear weapons. - So, military might is essential for maintaining a balance\nof power and peace. - Well, if you're interested\nin deterring an adversary, if I'm worried about you coming after me, the best way to deter you\nis to have military might. And if you're Russia, and I'm Ukraine, I'm far weaker than you. - [Lex] Yeah, right? - And having a nuclear deterrent, would be very effective at\nconvincing you not to attack me. Because if you attack me,\nyou're threatening my survival. And that's the one circumstance where it is likely that I\nwould use nuclear weapons to defend myself. And given the consequences of nuclear use, you would be reluctant in\nthe extreme to attack me. So, that's why I argued in '93 that if Ukraine kept its nuclear weapons that made war down the\nroad much less likely. And I believe I was correct. And in fact, Bill Clinton, who played the key role in forcing Ukraine to give\nup its nuclear weapons, now says he has said it publicly, you can find it on YouTube that he made a mistake doing that. Furthermore, I argued in 2014 that it made eminently good sense, not to continue to push to\nbring Ukraine into NATO, because the end result is that\nUkraine would be destroyed and Ukraine is being destroyed. So, I was deeply interested\nat time in making sure that that didn't happen for\nthe good of the Ukrainians, not to mention, because\nstability in Europe is a net positive for\nalmost everybody involved, but people did not\nlisten to me then either. - How did nuclear weapons, change the calculus of offensive realism? Because of mutually assured destruction. I mean, it's not just military might, it's just so destructive that you basically can't\nuse nuclear weapons, unless you want complete destruction. - There's no question that the\npresence of nuclear weapons, makes it much less likely. I'm choosing my words carefully here. Much less likely that a great power, would aggress against another great power. It doesn't take that\npossibility off the table, but it makes it much less likely, because of the reasons\nthat you articulated. But with regard to nuclear use, it's an interesting question. How you think about\nnuclear use in a mad world. I mean, your point that\nwe're in a mad world is, that's mad, capital M-A-D as\nwell as M-A-D, small letters, but let's stick to the capital letters. We're in a world of mutual\nassured destruction. There's no question that in that world, it's unlikely that nuclear\nweapons would be used. But the way you use nuclear\nweapons in that world is you use them for\nmanipulation of risk purposes, demonstration effect. You put both sides out\non the slippery slope. Now, what exactly am I saying here? Let me talk about NATO doctrine. During the Cold War, we lived in a mad world, United States and Soviet Union, or the Warsaw Pact in NATO, both had an assured\ndestruction capability. So, you had mutual assured destruction. If the Warsaw Pact were\nto invade western Europe and here we're talking about West Germany and NATO was losing the war, we said that we would use nuclear weapons. How would we use nuclear weapons, given that we were in a mad world? The argument was that\nwe would use a handful of nuclear weapons\nagainst the Warsaw Pact, not necessarily against\ntheir military forces, could be in a remote area. We would use a small\nnumber of nuclear weapons to signal to the Soviets\nthat we were deadly serious, about putting an end to their offensive. And that we were throwing both sides, out on the slippery slope to oblivion. In other words, we were manipulating risk. And the last clear chance\nto avoid Armageddon, rested with them. And then we would tell\nthem that if you retaliated with a handful of nuclear weapons and you didn't cease your\noffensive against West Germany, we would launch a small\nanother nuclear attack. We would explode a handful\nmore of nuclear weapons, all for the purposes of\nshowing you our resolve, right? So, this is the manipulation\nof risk strategy and a lot of the language I just used in describing it to you is language that Thomas Schelling invented, right? Now, fast forward to the present, if Russia were losing in Ukraine, that's the one scenario where I think where Russia would've\nused nuclear weapons. And the question is, how would Russia have\nused nuclear weapons? Again, we're assuming that the Russians are losing to the Ukrainians. I believe they would've pursued a manipulation risk strategy. They would've used four or\nfive, three or four, who knows? Nuclear weapons. - Maybe just one in a rural\narea that kills very few people. - Yes, exactly. And basically that would spook everybody. The American- - Just the mushroom cloud. - Yeah. It's because of the threat of escalation. Again, you your point\nis we're in a mad world. I accept that. And if you have limited\nnuclear use, right? We understand hardly anything\nabout nuclear escalation, because thank goodness we've\nnever had a nuclear war. So, once you throw both sides\nout on the slippery slope, even if you only use one\nnuclear weapon in your scenario, you don't know what the\nescalation dynamics look like. So, everybody has a powerful incentive to put an end to the conflict right away. I might add to you that there were people who believed that we\nwould not even initiate a manipulation of risk strategy in Europe if we were losing to the Warsaw\nPact during the Cold War. Both Henry Kissinger and Robert McNamara said\nafter leaving office, that they would not have done it. They would've not initiated nuclear use, even limited nuclear use. That's what we're talking about here. They would rather be red than dead, right? That was the argument. - [Lex] Too risky. - Too risky, that's exactly right. But if they had used one\nnuclear weapon in your story or three or four in my story, everybody would've said, \"Oh my God, we've got to shut\nthis one down immediately.\" I only tell you this story\nor lay out this scenario as an answer to your question\nof how you use nuclear weapons in a mad world. And this is the answer - This is all very terrifying. Perhaps in part, it's terrifying to me, because I can see in the\n21st century China, Russia, Israel, United States using\na nuclear weapon in this way, blowing it up somewhere\nin the middle of nowhere that kills maybe nobody. But I'm terrified of\nseeing the mushroom cloud and not knowing what given social media, given how fast news travels, what the escalation looks like there. Just in a matter of minutes\nhow the news travels and how the leaders react, it's terrifying that this\nlittle demonstration of power, the ripple effects of it in\na matter of minutes, seconds, what that leads to, because it's like, it's human emotions. It's like you see the\nlandscape of human emotions, the leaders and the populace and the way news are reported, and then the landscape of\nrisk, as you mentioned, shifting like the world's most intense, non-linear dynamical system. And it is just terrifying, 'cause the entirety of\nhuman civilizations hangs in the balance there. And it's like this, like hundreds of millions\nof people could be dead. - Let's just talk about\nthis in the context of the Ukraine war. If the Russians were\nlosing as I said before, which is not the case anymore, but in 2022, it did look like that. If the Russians are losing and\nthey turn to nuclear weapons, the question is how do they use them? And they would use them in Ukraine. And because Ukraine has no\nnuclear weapons of its own, Ukraine cannot retaliate. It's not a mutual assured\ndestruction world. It's a case where one\nside has nuclear weapons and the other doesn't. That means that the Russians are likely to think that they can get away with using nuclear weapons in ways that would not be the case if they were attacking NATO. And therefore it makes\nnuclear use more likely. Okay that's point one. Point two is let's assume\nthat the Russians use two or three nuclear weapons in a remote area. - My paws are sweating, by the way, just as a commentary, it's terrifying. - Yeah, the question then\nis what does the West do? Now, Macron has said and Biden has also, I think implicitly made this clear, we would not retaliate\nwith nuclear weapons if the Russians were to attack with a handful of nuclear\nweapons in Western Ukraine. But then the question\nis, what would we do? And if you listen to David Petraeus, what David Petraeus says\nis that we should attack the Russian naval assets in the Black Sea and attack Russian forces in Ukraine. Well, once you do that,\nyou have a great power war. You have NATO versus Russia, which is another way of saying you have the United States versus Russia. We're now in a great power war. They have nuclear weapons,\nwe have nuclear weapons. They've used nuclear weapons. What is the happy ending here? And just to take it a step further and go back to our earlier discussion, about moving NATO up to Russia's borders. The point I made, which you surely agree with, is that the Russians are very fearful when they see NATO coming\nup to their border. Well, here's a case where not only is NATO come up to their border, but they're in a war with\nNATO right on their border. What do the escalation\ndynamics look like there? You know what the answer is? Who knows? That should scare the live-in\nbejesus out of you, right? - And some of it could be,\nlike you mentioned, unintended. That could be unintended consequences, that could be a Russian\nmissile misses and hits Poland, these kinds of things that just\nescalate misunderstandings, miscommunications, even I mean, nuclear weapon could be, boy, it could have been\nplanned to go location X and it went to a location Y that ended up actually killing a very large number of people. I mean, just that the\nescalation that happens there, just happens in a matter of minutes. And the only way to stop that is communication between leaders. And that to me is a big argument\nfor ongoing communication. - There's a story that during\nthe Cuban missile crisis, Kennedy put out the word no\naircraft under any circumstances are to penetrate Soviet airspace. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - And he then found out a few days later that some guy hadn't gotten the message and had penetrated in an aircraft\ndeep into Soviet airspace. And this supports your basic\npoint that bad things happen. And again the overarching point here is we've never done\nthis before, thankfully, therefore, we don't\nhave a lot of experience as to how it plays itself out. It's really a theoretical enterprise, because there's no empirical basis for talking about escalation\nin a nuclear crisis. And that of course is a wonderful thing. - Well, and in general the\nhuman species as a whole is a one-off is a theoretical enterprise. The survival of the human species, we've seen empires rise and fall, but we haven't seen the\nhuman species rise and fall. So, far it's been rising, but it's not obvious that it doesn't end. In fact, I think about aliens a lot. And the fact that we don't\nsee aliens makes me suspect it's not so easy to survive in this complicated world of ours. Switching gears a little bit and going to a different\npart of the world, also engulfed in war. Let me ask you about\nthe situation in Israel. Why did Hamas attack Israel\non October 7th, 2023? As you understand the situation, what was the reason that attack happened? - Well, I think the main reason was that you had this\nsuffocating occupation. I think as long as the\noccupation persists, the Palestinians are going to resist. As you well know, this\nis not the first time there has been a Palestinian uprising. There was the First Intifada,\nthere was the Second Intifada, now there's October 7th, and their uprisings besides those three, so this is not terribly surprising, a lot of people hypothesized\nthat this attack was due to the fact that the Israelis, the Saudis and the Americans\nwere working together to foster another Abraham Accord, and that the Palestinians would in effect be sold down the river. I think given the fact that\nthis was in the planning stages for probably about two years, and the Abraham Accords\nwith regard to Saudi Arabia are relatively new phenomenon, I don't think that's the\nmain driving force here. I think the main driving force is that the Palestinians\nfeel oppressed as they should and that this was a resistance move. They were resisting\nthe Israeli occupation. - So, that resistance, the attack involved killing a large number of Israeli civilians. There's many questions to ask there, but one is do you think\nHamas fully understood what the retaliation will\ninvolve from Israel into Gaza? - They had to understand. I mean, you had Operation\nCast Lead in 2008, 2009. It started, I think right\nafter Christmas 2008. And it ended right before\nPresident Obama took office in January, 2009. And the Israelis periodically do what they call mowing the lawn, where they go into Gaza and they pound the\nPalestinians to remind them that they're not supposed to\nrise up and cause any problem. So, there's no question in my mind that the Hamas forces understood full well that the Israelis would retaliate\nand they would retaliate in force as they have done. - Yeah, even the metaphor\nof mowing the lawn is disturbing to me in many ways. I actually saw Norman\nFinkelstein, I think, say that, well then if\nyou use that metaphor, then you could say that Hamas\nwas also mowing the lawn. And it's such a horrific image, because the result on either side is just the death of civilians. I mean, let me ask you about\nthe death of civilians. So, during the attack,\n1400 Israelis were killed. Over 240 were taken hostage. And then in response, as we sit today, Israel's military response has killed over 10,000 people in Gaza. And given the nature of the demographics, it's a very heavily young population. Over 40% of them are under\nthe age of 18 of those killed. That's of course, according to Ministry of Health\nof Palestinian Authority. So, what do you think\nis the long-term effect on the prospect of peace\nwhen so many civilians die? - I mean, I think it's disastrous. I mean, the only way\nyou're gonna get peace here is if you have a two-state solution where the Palestinians have a\nsovereign state of their own and there is a sovereign Jewish state. And these two states live side by side, American presidents since Jimmy Carter, have understood this full well. And this is why we have pushed very hard for two-state solution. Indeed, many American Jews and many Israelis have pushed\nfor a two-state solution, because they think that that\nis the only way you're going to get peace between the two sides. But what's happened here\nis that in recent years, the Israelis have lost all\ninterest in a two-state solution. And it's in large part\nbecause the political center of gravity in Israel has\nsteadily moved to the right. When I was a young boy, the political center of gravity in Israel was much further to the\nleft than it is today. And it is in a position now\nthe political center of gravity where there's hardly any\nsupport for two-state solution and Netanyahu and the rest of\nthe people in his government were in favor or are in\nfavor of a greater Israel. There's just no question about that. Well, on top of that, you now have had a war\nwhere, as you described, huge numbers of civilians have been killed and you already had bad blood\nbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis before this conflict. And you could imagine how people on each side now feel about\npeople on the other side. So, even if you didn't have\nthis opposition inside Israel to a two-state solution, how could you possibly get the Israelis now to agree to a two-state solution? I think for the foreseeable future, the animosity inside Israel\ntowards the Palestinians is so great that it is\nimpossible to move the Israelis in that direction. And the Israelis here\nare the key players more, so than the Palestinians, because it's the Israelis\nwho control greater Israel. It's the Israelis who\nyou have to convince. Now, I wanna be clear here, you also ultimately have\nto get around the fact that Hamas is not committed\nto a two-state solution. But I think that problem\ncould be dealt with. It's important to understand that Arafat and the PLO was once adamantly opposed to a two-state solution, but Arafat came around to understand that that was really the\nonly hope for settling this. And he became a proponent\nof a two-state solution. And that's true of Mahmoud Abbas who runs the PA in the West Bank. It's not true of Hamas\nat this point in time. They want a one -state solution, they want a Palestinian state. And of course, the Israelis want a\none state solution too, which is a Jewish state that controls all of\nall of greater Israel. So the question is, can you\nget some sort of agreement? And I think to get to your, the number of your question,\ngiven what's just happened, it's almost impossible to imagine that happening anytime soon. - The cynical perspective here is that those in power\nbenefit from conflict, while the people on both sides suffer. Is there degree of truth to that? Or for the people in\npower to maintain power, conflict needs to continue. - No, I don't believe that. I mean, just to take\nthe Netanyahu government or any Israeli Government\nthat maintains the occupation, what you want is you want\na Palestinian population that submits to Israeli\ndomination of Greater Israel. You don't want resistance. You don't want an Intifada, you don't want what\nhappened on October 7th. In fact, I think one of\nthe principle reasons that the Israelis are pounding Gaza and killing huge numbers of civilians, punishing the civilian population in ways that clearly\nviolate the laws of war, is because they want the Palestinians to understand that they\nare not allowed to rise up and resist the occupation. That's their goal. So, I think the Israelis would prefer that the Palestinians roll\nover and accept submission. In terms of the people who live in Gaza, to include the elites and the people who live in the West Bank to include the elites. They would much prefer to\nmove to some sort of situation where the Palestinians\nhave a state of their own. I think in the case of the PA under Abbas, they would accept the two-state solution. I think what at this\npoint in time Hamas wants is a one-state solution,\nbut they want peace. All of them want peace. The two different sets of\nleadership in Palestine and the Israelis. - So, you think Hamas wants peace? - Sure. But on its own terms, that's the point. - What does peace look like for Hamas? - At this point in time, I think peace basically\nmeans a greater Israel, controlled by Palestine or Palestinians. - Okay, so essentially, I mean the whole land is called Palestine and there's no Israel. - I think at this point in time\nthat's their principle goal. I do believe and there\nhave been hints over time, Jimmy Carter has said this, that Hamas can be convinced\nthat a two-state solution, assuming that the Palestinians\nget a viable state of their own, that Hamas\nwould buy into that. Can we say that with a\nhigh degree of certainty? No, but I think the\nIsraelis should have pursued that possibility. They should have worked with Abbas. They should have worked with Hamas to do everything they can to facilitate a two-state solution. Because I think ultimately\nthat's an Israel's interest. Now, the Israeli government and most Israelis at this point in time, I believe, don't agree with that. - What do you think of Israel starting the ground invasion of Gaza\nrecently on October 27th? - The question is, should they continue until they\nhave finally defeated Hamas? There are all sorts of\nreports in the media, including in the Israeli media, that they're not gonna be allowed by the United States to\ncontinue this offensive from much more than a few weeks. The Israelis have been saying it would, it's gonna take in the best\nof all possible worlds, a number of months if not\na year to finish off Hamas. Well, it doesn't look like they're gonna have enough time to do that. I doubt whether they can finish off Hamas, even if they're given the time. I think they're gonna run\ninto fierce resistance. And when they run into fierce resistance and large numbers of\nIsraelis gonna start to die, they'll lose their appetite for this. And they, the Israelis\nsurely know at this point in time that even if\nthey finish off Hamas, even if I'm wrong and they're\nable to finish off Hamas, another group is gonna rise\nup to resist the occupation. The idea that you can use\nwhat Ze'ev Jabotinsky, called the Iron Wall to\nbeat the Palestinians into submission is delusional. It's just not gonna happen. The Palestinians want\na state of their own. They don't wanna live under occupation. And there's no military\nsolution for Israel here. There has to be a political solution. And the only viable political solution is a two-state solution. I mean, you can't go to democracy. You can't go to a situation where you give the\nPalestinians equal rights, inside a greater Israel in large part, because there are now as many Palestinians as there are Israeli Jews. And over time the balance, the demographic balance shifts\nagainst the Israeli Jews and in favor of the Palestinians, in which case you'll end up with a Palestinian\nstate in greater Israel. So, democracy for all doesn't work. The Israelis, I believe are quite interested\nin ethnic cleansing. I think they saw this recent set of events as an opportunity to cleanse Gaza. But that's not gonna happen. The Jordanians and the\nEgyptians have made it clear that that's not happening. The United States is now made it clear that that's not happening. And the Palestinians will not leave. They'll die in place. So, ethnic cleansing doesn't work. So, you're really left\nwith two alternatives, a two-state solution or a greater Israel that is\neffectively an apartheid state. I mean, that's what the\noccupation has led to. And all sorts of people\nhave been predicting this for a long, long time. And you've now reached the point, here in the United States, if you say that Israel's\nan apartheid state, that's gonna get you into\nall sorts of trouble. But the fact is that human rights watch, Amnesty International and B'Tselem which is the leading\nIsraeli human rights group, all three of those institutions or organizations have\nissued detailed reports,, making the case that Israel\nis an apartheid state. Furthermore, if you\nread the Israeli media, all sorts of Israelis,\nincluding Israeli leaders, refer to Israel as an apartheid state. It's not that unusual to hear\nthat term used in Israel. This is disastrous for\nIsrael in my opinion. And Steve Walt and I said this by the way, when we wrote \"The Israel Lobby\", that Israel is an apartheid state, which is equivalent to\nIsrael as an occupier is not good for Israel. And that brings us back\nto the two-state solution, but is you and I were talking\nabout a few minutes ago, it's hard to see how you\nget a two-state solution. And the end result of this\nconversation is utter despair. - Because the path to a\ntwo-state solution is blocked by the amount of hate that's\ncreated by civilian deaths. - Well, that plus the fact\nthat the Israeli government is filled with people who have no interest in\na two-state solution. They're ideologically deeply\ncommitted to a greater Israel. They want all the land\nbetween the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea to\nbe part of a Jewish state. They're just ideologically\ncommitted to that. And of course, as we were\ntalking about before, with regard to Hamas, Hamas wants everything\nbetween the river and the sea to be a Palestinian state. And when you have two sides with those kinds of views, right? You are in deep trouble, because there's little\nroom for compromise. So, what you have to\ndo to get this to work is you have to convince the Israelis that it's in their interest\nto have a two-state solution. And you've already taken\ncare of the PA on this front, the Palestinian Authority, but you've gotta convince Hamas that its Maximalist goals\nare are not gonna work in its interest to follow\nin the footsteps of Arafat and accept a two-state solution. But even if you do that at this point, let's say that there's a lot\nof willingness intellectually on both sides to do that. The problem is that the\nhatred that has been fueled by this recent ongoing conflict, is so great that it's just hard to imagine how you can make a two-state\nsolution work at this juncture. That's why I've sort of taken to saying and I hope I'm wrong here, that on the two-state\nsolution that boat has sailed. It's just it's no longer possible. - Well, again, I believe in leadership and there's other parties at play here, other nations, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, other players in the\nMiddle East that can help, that can help through a\nnormalization of relationships and these kinds of things. There's always hope, like you said, slither of hope. - [John] Slither of hope. - I think human civilization\nprogresses forward by taking advantage of the\nall the slithers it can get. Let me ask you about, you\nmentioned \"The Israel Lobby\". You wrote a book, probably your most\ncontroversial book on the topic, - Not probably, clearly the most controversial\nbook I ever wrote. - So you've criticized Israel\nlobby in the United States for influencing US policy\nin the Middle East. Can you explain what\n\"The Israel Lobby\" is, their influence and your\ncriticism over the past, let's say a couple decades? - Well, the argument that\nSteve Walt and I made, actually, we wrote an article first and which appeared in the\n\"London Review of Books,\" and then we wrote the book itself. Our argument is that the lobby is a loose coalition of\nindividuals and organizations that push American policy\nin a pro-Israel direction. And basically, the lobby is\ninterested in getting Israel, excuse me, getting the United States. And here we're talking mainly\nabout the American Government to support Israel no\nmatter what Israel does. And our argument is that if\nyou look at the relationship, between the United States and Israel, it's unprecedented in modern history. This is the closest relationship that you can find\nbetween any two countries in recorded history. It's truly amazing the\nextent to which Israel and the United States\nare joined at the hip. And we support Israel no matter what, almost all the time. And our argument is\nthat that is largely due to the influence of the lobby. The lobby is an extremely\npowerful interest group. Now, it's very important to understand that the American political system is set up in ways that\nallow interest groups of all sorts to wield great influence. So, in the United States, you have an interest group or a lobby, like the National Rifle\nAssociation that makes it, well, not impossible to get gun control. Yeah, right. And so with \"The Israel Lobby,\" you have this group of\nindividuals and organizations that wield enormous\ninfluence on US policy, toward the Middle East. And this is not surprising given the nature of the\nAmerican political system. So, our argument is that the lobby is not doing anything\nthat's illegal or elicit or immoral or unethical. It's just a good old fashioned\nAmerican interest group. And it just happens to\nbe extremely powerful. And our argument is that this is not good for the United States, because no two countries\nhave the same interests, all the time. And when our interests conflict\nwith Israel's interests, we should be able to do what we think is in our national interest,\nin America's national interest. But the lobby tends to conflate\nAmerica's national interest with Israel's national interest and wants the United\nStates to support Israel, no matter what. We also argue, and I cannot emphasize this enough, given what's going on in the world today, that the lobby's effects, the lobby has not been pushing policies that are in Israel's interest. So, our argument is that\nthe lobby pushes policies that are not in America's interest or not in Israel's interest. Now, you're saying to yourself, what exactly does he mean by that? What every president since\nJimmy Carter has tried to do, as I said before, is to foster a two-state\nsolution to push Israel, which is the dominant\nplayer in Greater Israel, push Israel to accept\nthe two-state solution. And we have run into huge resistance from the lobby whenever we tried to, let's be blunt about it,\ncoerce Israel, right? In a perfect world\nwhere there was no lobby and an American president was free to put pressure on Israel, to coerce Israel, I believe we would've gone a long way, towards getting two-state solution. And I believe this would've\nbeen in Israel's interest, but we couldn't get a two-state solution, because it was almost impossible to put meaningful pressure on\nIsrael because of the lobby. So, this was not in Israel's interest and it was not in America's interest. And that was the argument that we made. And we of course got huge\npushback for making that argument. - What's the underlying\nmotivation of the lobby? Is it religious in nature? Is it similar to the way war hawks are, sort of militaristic in nature? Is it nationalistic in nature? If you were de describe\nthis coalition of people, what would you say is their motivation? - Well, first of all, I think you have to distinguish\nbetween Jews and Christians. You wanna remember that there are a huge number\nof Christians Zionists, who are deeply committed to\nIsrael no matter what, right? And then there are a large number of Jews. The Jews are obviously the most important of those two groups in \"The Israel Lobby\". But one of the arguments\nthat we made in the book is that you should not\ncall it the Jewish lobby, because it's not populated just by Jews. And Christians Zionists are an\nimportant part of that lobby. But furthermore, there are a good number of Jews\nwho are opposed to the lobby and the policies that the lobby prevails. And there a number of Jews who are prominent anti-Zionists, right? So, and they're obviously not in the lobby or if you take a group like\nJewish Voice for Peace, right? Jewish Voice for Peace\nis not in the lobby. So, it's wrong to call it a Jewish lobby. But with regard to the American\nJews who were in that lobby, I think that really, this\nis all about nationalism. It's not so much religion. Many of those Jews who are influential in the lobby are not religious in any meaningful sense of that term, but they self-identify as Jewish in the sense that they feel\nthey're part of a Jewish nation. And that in addition to being an American, they are part of this tribe,\nthis nation called Jews and that they have a responsibility to push the United States in ways that support the Jewish state. So, I think that's what drives most, if not almost all the Jews. This is not to say there's\nnot a religious dimension for some of them, but I think that the main connection is much more tribal in nature. - So, I had a conversation\nwith Benjamin Netanyahu and he said, fundamentally,\nif you're anti-Zionist, you're anti-Semitic. So, the Zionist project\nis tied to the hip, to the Jewish project. What do you have to say to that? - Look, you can define anti-Semitism, any way you want, right? And you can define anti-Semitism to incorporate anti-Zionism. And I think we have reached\nthe point where antisemitism is identified today, not\njust with anti-Zionism, but with criticism of Israel. If you criticize Israel, people will say some people will say, you're an antisemite and if that's your\ndefinition of antisemitism, it's taken an important term and stretched it to the point\nwhere it's meaningless, right? So, when Steve and I wrote the book, wrote the article and then wrote the book, all sorts of people said\nthat we were anti-Semite, this is a ludicrous charge. But what they meant was, you're criticizing the lobby, you're criticizing Israel, and therefore you're an antisemite. Okay if that's what an antisemite is, somebody who criticizes Israel, probably half the Jewish community, if not more in the United\nStates is antisemitic. And of course, you get\ninto all these crazy games where people are calling\nJews, self-hating Jews, and anti-Semites because\nthey're critical of Israel. But even people who are anti-Zionists, I don't think they're anti-Semitic at all. You can argue they're\nmisguided, that's fine. But many of these people are Jewish and proud of the fact that they're Jewish. They just don't believe that nationalism and Jewish nationalism is a\nforce that should be applauded. And you wanna understand\nthat in the American context, there is a rich tradition\nof anti-Zionism, right? And these were not people\nwho were anti-Semites, if you go back to the 30s, 40s, 50s. And the same thing was\neven true in Europe. There were all sorts of European Jews who were opposed to Zionism. Were they anti-Semite? I don't think so, but we've gotten to the point now where people are so interested in stopping any criticism of Israel that they wield this weapon\nof calling people anti-Semite, so loosely that the term\nhas kinda lost meaning. So, I think Netanyahu is wrongheaded to equate anti-Zionism with antisemitism. - Alan Dershowitz was one of the people that called you specifically antisemitic. So, just looking at\nthe space of discourse, how do you, where's the slither of\nhope for healthy discourse, about US relationships with Israel, between you and Alan\nDershowitz and others like him? - Well, I think until there is a settlement of the\nIsraeli Palestinian conflict, there's no hope of putting an\nend to this nonsense, right? - So, these are just uses of terms to kinda cheat your way\nthrough the discourse. It's shortcut. - No, it's to silence people, right? So, it's very, very important to understand that one of\nthe lobby's principle goals is to make sure we don't\nhave an open discourse, a freewheeling discourse about Israel, because they understand\npeople in the lobby understand that if you have an open discourse, Israel will end up\nlooking very bad, right? You don't wanna talk about the occupation, you don't wanna talk about\nhow Israel was created, right? All these subjects are ones that will cause problems for Israel. See, just to go to the\npresent crisis, okay? When you have a disaster and what happened on\nOctober 7th is a disaster, one of the first things that happens is that people begin to ask the question, how did this happen, right? What's the root cause of this problem? This is a disaster. We have to understand what caused it, so that we can work to make\nsure it doesn't happen again, so we can work to shut it down and then make sure it\ndoesn't happen again. But once you start talking\nabout the root causes, right? You end up talking about how\nIsrael was created, right? And that means telling a\nstory that is not pretty, about how the Zionists\nconquered Palestine. And number two, it means talking about\nthe occupation, right? It's not like Hamas\nattacked on October 7th, because there were just\na bunch of anti-Semite who hated Jews and wanted to kill Jews. This is not Nazi Germany, right? This is directly related to the occupation and to what was going on inside of Gaza. And it's not in Israel's interest or the lobby's interest\nto have an open discourse, about what the Israelis have\nbeen doing to the Palestinians, since I would say roughly 1903 when the Second Aliyah came to Israel or came to what was then Palestine, right? We wanna talk about that. And we don't want to talk about from the lobbyist's point of view, the influence that the lobby has, right? It's better from the\nlobbyist's point of view, if most Americans think that\nAmericans support of Israel is just done for all the right\nmoral and strategic reasons, not because of the lobby. And when John Mearsheimer and\nSteve Walt come along and say, you have to understand that\nthis special relationship is due in large part to\nthe lobby's influence, that is not an argument that people in the lobby want to hear. So, the point is, you have to go to great\nlengths for all these reasons. You have to go to great lengths\nto silence people like me and Steve Walt. And one of the ways to do that\nis to call us anti-Semite. I think the chapter or\nthe section of the book where we talk about this charge of antisemitism is called\n\"The Great Silencer.\" That's what we call the\ncharge of antisemitism, the great silencer. Who wants to be called an antisemite, especially in the wake of the Holocaust? Do I wanna be called an antisemite? Oh my God, no. And so it's very effective, but it is important to\ntalk about these issues in my humble opinion. And I think if we had\ntalked about these issues, way back when, it would've\ngone a long way towards, maybe getting a two-state solution, which I think was the\nbest alternative here. - It it's complicated. And I wonder if you can comment\non the complexity of this, because criticizing Israel and criticizing the lobby can for a lot of people be a dog whistle for sort of anti-Semitic\nconspiracy theories that this idea that Jews run everything, run the world or this kind of cabal. And it's also very true that people who are\nlegitimately anti-Semitic are also critics of Israel\nin the same kind of way. And so it's such a\ncomplicated landscaping. We should have discussions because, even people like David Duke who are racist don't sound\nracist on the surface. I haven't listened to 'em enough, but like there's dog whistles. It's a complicated space in\nwhich to have discussions, because I mean, I wonder if\nyou can sort of speak to that, because there's this silencing effect of calling everybody anti-Semitic. But it's also true that there\nis anti-Semitism in the world. Like there is the sizeable\npopulation of people that hate Jews. There's probably a sizeable\npopulation of people who hate Muslims too. - [John] A lot of hate out there. - A lot of hate out there. But the hatred of Jews\nhas like a long history. And so you have like rolling Stones, have a set of great hits and there's just a set of great hits of the ways conspiracy theories that you can make about the Jews that are used as part of the hatred. So, there's like nice templates for that. And I just wonder if you can comment on operating as a\nhistorian, as an analyst, as a strategic thinker\nin this kind of space. - Yeah, we obviously, when we wrote the article, which we did before the book, gave this subject a great deal of thought. I mean, what you say just\nnow is music to our ears and I'm talking about me and Steve. I mean, I think that your point about dog whistles is correct. Look, we went to great\nlengths to make it clear that this is not a cabal,\nit's not a conspiracy. And in fact, in a very important way, the lobby operates out in the open, right? They brag about their power, right? And this was true before we\nwrote the article, right? And we said in the article and the book and you heard me say\nit here, first of all, it's not a Jewish lobby, right? Secondly, it's not a cabal, right? It's an American interest group. - And the American system is designed, such that interest groups\nare perfectly legal and some of them are super effective. - Exactly. I mean, you hit the\nnail right on the head. That's exactly right. And there was nothing that we\nsaid that was anti-Semitic, by any reasonable definition of that term. And huge numbers of Jews have known me and Steve over the years, and nobody ever, ever said\nthat we were anti-Semitic, before March, 2006 when\nthe article appeared, because we're not antisemitic. But look, you've got this\ninterest group, right? That has a significant\ninfluence on American policy and on Israeli policy and you wanna talk about it. It's just important to talk about it. It's important for Jews, right? In the United States, for Jews\nin Israel to talk about this. The idea that you wanna silence critics, is not a smart way to\ngo about doing business, in my opinion. If we were wrong, if Steve and I were so wrong\nand our arguments were so foul, they could have easily\nexposed those arguments. They could have gone into combat with this in terms of\nthe marketplace of ideas and easily knocked this down. The problem was that our\narguments were quite powerful. And instead of engaging us\nand defeating our arguments, they wanted to silence us. And this is not good, right? It's not good for Israel, it's not good for the United States. And I would argue in the end, if anything it's gonna\nfoster antisemitism. I think you don't wanna\nrun around telling people that they can't talk about Israel, without being called an antisemite. It's just not, it's not healthy in terms of the issue that you're raising, right? But I still agree with you\nthat it is a tricky issue. I don't wanna make light of that. I know that there's this\npiece of literature out there, called the \"Protocols\nof the Elders of Zion,\" and I fully understand\nthat if you're not careful, you can come close to writing\nvolume two of the protocol. But I don't believe that we wrote anything that was even close to that. And again, I think that a\nhealthy debate on the issues that we were raising would've been, not only in America's interest, but it would've been in Israel's interest. - Yeah, I mean, underneath it all is just, I wonder why there's so\nmuch hate against groups, why it's such a sticky way of thinking, not just tribalism, like\nproud of your country and kind of hating another country, but really deeply hating, like hating in a way where it's part of your\nidentity kind of hate. - Well, just to make a\ngeneral point on this issue in our conversation here today, you often talk about individual leaders and the word individual often\npops up in your vocabulary. - [Lex] Yes. - I believe that we are\nultimately social animals, before we are individuals. I believe we're born into tribes, we're heavily socialized and that we carve out space\nfor our individualism. But we are part of tribes and\nor social groups or nations, call them what you want, ethnic groups, religious groups. But the fact is that these tribes, often crash into each other, and when they crash into each other, they end up hating each other. If you go to a place like Bosnia, right? The Croats and the Serbs, oh my God. And then throw in the Bosniaks or which is the term for Bosnian Muslims, and Muslims, Croats, Serbs, oh, and the tribes hate each other. And in a funny way, that\nhatred almost never goes away. And I guess there are\nsome exceptions to that. If you look at the Germans\nafter World War II, they've gone a long way towards reducing, I wouldn't wanna say\ncompletely eliminating, but reducing a lot of the hatred that existed between\nGermans and their neighbors. But that's really kind\nof an anomalous case. I mean, you go around East Asia today and the hatred of Japan\nin a place like China, the hatred of Japan in a place like Korea, just not to be underestimated. And so but I think a\nlot of it just has to do with the fact that you're\ndealing with social groups that have crashed into each\nother at one point or another. And there are those lingering effects. And by the way, this gets back to our\ndiscussion a few minutes ago, about trying to get a two-state solution, between the Palestinians\nand the Israeli Jews. Now, that you have had this horrible war, which is ongoing. - It's interesting to ask,\nto go back to World War II. Now, you said you studied\nNazi Germany in the '30s from a perspective of\nmaybe offensive realism, but just to look at the Holocaust, it's sometimes popular\nin public discourse today to compare certain\nthings to the Holocaust. People have compared the\nHamas attack on Israel to the Holocaust saying things like, it's the biggest attack on\nJews since the Holocaust, which kind of implies\nthat there's a comparison. People have made that same comparison in the other direction. What do you make of this comparison? Is it comparable? Is the use of the Holocaust, have any accuracy in comparisons of modern day international politics? - Is it possible that you\ncould have another genocide? Yes. And I would argue that\nwhat you had in Rwanda was a genocide, right? The Holocaust is not the only genocide. I believe the word genocide\nis used too loosely today. And as lots of people\nand I mean lots of people who are pro-Palestinian accused\nthe Israelis of engaging in genocide in Gaza. I think what the Israelis\nare doing in Gaza, represents a massacre. I would use that term given\nthe number of civilians that they've killed and the fact that they've\nbeen indiscriminate in terms of how they've been bombing Gaza. But I would not use the word genocide. For me, a genocide is\nwhere one side attempts to eliminate another\ngroup from the planet. I think that what happened\nwith the Holocaust was clearly a genocide and that the Germans\nwere bent on destroying, all of European Jewry. And if they could have gotten their hands on Jews outside of Europe, they would've murdered them as well. That's a genocide. And I think with the\nHutu's and the Tootsies, you had a similar situation. I think with the Turks and the\nArmenians during World War I. That was a genocide, but I have a rather narrow\ndefinition of what a genocide is. And I don't think there are many cases that qualify as a genocide. The Holocaust certainly does, okay? Now, what Hamas did\ndoesn't even come close to what happened to European Jewry, between, let's say 1939 and 1945, although I date the start\nof the Holocaust in 1941, if we were looking at it closely, but let's just say 1939,\nwhen they invade Poland. From 1939 to 1945, what Hamas did parallels in comparison. It's hard to believe anybody would make that argument, right? Yes, a lot of Jews died, but hardly any compared\nto the number that died at the hands of the Germans. I mean, it just no parallel at all. And furthermore, Hamas was in no position\nto kill all the Jews in the Middle East. Just not gonna happen. - Yeah, but there's also\na lot levels of things, using Germans using human skin for lamps. There's just levels of evil in this world. - Yes, but you don't see that with, I mean, that's not what Hamas is doing. No, I mean, I wanna be very clear here. I am not justifying Hamas'\nkilling of civilians, okay? Not for one second, but I'm just saying and by the way, just to go to the Israelis and what they're doing in Gaza, right, is I said to you before, I do believe that is a massacre, and I believe that's to be condemned, the killing of civilians. This is not legitimate collateral damage. They're directly punishing the population. But I would not call\nthat a genocide, right? And I would not compare\nthat to the Holocaust for one second. I just wanna be very clear on that. - Do you think if Israel could, they would avoid the\ndeath of any civilians? So, you're saying there's some degree of punishment of collective- - No, they're purposely killing civilians. This is the iron wall. They're trying to beat the Palestinians in the submission, right? There's no way you kill\nthis many civilians if you're trying to precisely\ntake out Hamas fighters. And by the way, the Israeli spokesman, the IDF spokesman has explicitly said that we are not pursuing\nprecision bombing. And that what we are doing is trying to maximize the amount\nof destruction and damage that we can inflict on the Palestinians. And I think this is a major\nmistake on the part of Israel. First of all, it ends up being a moral\nstain on your reputation, number one. And number two, it doesn't\nwork. It doesn't work. The Palestinians are not gonna roll over and submit to Israeli\ndomination of their life. So, the whole concept of the Iron Wall, Jabotinsky's term was misguided. And by the way, if you look at what\nthe Israelis are doing, they're trying to do two things. One is the Iron Wall and that's where you punish\nthe civilian population in Gaza and get them to submit. The other thing that they're\ntrying to do is get Hamas, they wanna destroy Hamas. And the belief there is\nthat if they destroy Hamas, they've solved the problem. But as many Israelis know, including people on the hard right, even if you destroy Hamas, they are going to be\nreplaced by another group, another resistance group and that resistance\ngroup will employ terror. - Yeah, I think you've said that other terrorist organizations\nhave used this situation in Palestine as a kind of\na recruitment mechanism for a long time. - Osama bin Laden made it clear that this was one of\nthis principle reasons for attacking the United States, right? - And the United States attacked back and got us into a 20-year war that cost the lives of millions of people. Not American, but I mean human beings. - [John] And engaged in torture. - Torture, yeah. - No, I think if you look\nat how we reacted to 9/11 and how the Israelis are reacting to what\nhappened on October 7th, there's quite a bit of\nsimilarity in that both sides, the Israeli side and the\nAmerican side are enraged, right? And they lash out and\nthey go on a rampage, and the end result is not good. - Is there a capacity within\nIsrael or within United States after 9/11 to do something approximating, turn the other cheek of understanding the root of terror, this hate and fighting that hate with, not to sound naive, but compassion. - Well, I don't think in either case, you're gonna turn the other cheek. - I think- - Well, some, what I mean by that is, some limited powerful military\nresponse, but very limited. - Yeah, coupled with a\nsmart political strategy. - [Lex] Political\nstrategy, diplomacy, yeah. - That's what they\nshould have done, right? - But is there capacity for that or from your offensive\nrealism perspective, it's just the odds are really low? - Well, from my offensive\nrealist perspective or my realist perspective that's\nwhat you should do, right? - [Lex] Okay. - My view is states are rational actors, they should be cunning, right? They should think about, the strategic situation they're in and choose the appropriate response. And what happens and this is why my theory\nis not always correct, is that sometimes states are not rational and they misbehave. I would argue in the Israeli case that it would've been\ngood after October 7th or starting on October 7th, if the United States had tried\nto hold the Israelis back and countenance a more moderate response, take some time just to\nthink about how to deal with this problem, instead of lashing out. I think, given what\nhappened to the Israelis, given how shocked they were, given the level of fear, given the level of rage\nthey were gonna lash out and I don't believe that\nwas in their interest, I think it would've made\nsense to think about it and to think about a smarter strategy than they're now employing. And I think the Americans blew it. The Americans gave 'em a\nbear hug and a green light and said, we'll give you\nall the weaponry you need and go out and do it. And I don't think that\nwas the smart thing to do. Look, in the wake of October 7th, the Israelis had no good strategy, right? It's not like there's a magic formula that they just didn't see. And we should have told them what the magic formula was, right? That's not true. They were in a sense, caught\nbetween a rock and a hard place in terms of what to do. But they're smarter\nthings than number things. And I think the Israelis lashed out in ways that are counterproductive. I think going on a rampage and killing huge numbers\nof civilians is not, it's obviously morally wrong, but it's also just not in their\nstrategic interest, right? I mean, 'cause it's not gonna\nbuy them anything, right? And in fact, it's gonna cost them, right? Because people all over the planet, are turning against Israel. I saw an Israeli think tank today that has been tracking\nprotests around the world, gave some figures for what it looked like, between October 7th and October 13th in terms of the number of\nprotests around the world that were pro-Israel versus pro-Palestine. And then it looked at the numbers from October 13th up to the present, and I think the numbers were\n69% were pro-Palestinian in the first six days\nafter October 7th, 69%. And I think 31% take these\nnumbers with a grain of salt. 31% were pro-Israel. So, I think it was 69 and 31. And since then, since October 13th, if you look at the number of\nprotests around the world, 95% have been pro-Palestinian\nand 5% have been pro-Israel. And what this tells you is that public opinion around the world has shifted against Israel. And if you look at some\nof the demonstrations in places like London and Washington, DC, it's truly amazing the number\nof people who are coming out in support of the Palestinians. And all of this, again, is\njust to support my point that it was just not smart for Israel to launch this bombing campaign, right? You can make an argument\nfor going after Hamas and doing it in a surgical way or as surgical way as possible. But that's not what they did. And again, my point to you is I think that this punishment campaign is not gonna work strategically. In other words, they're not gonna beat the\nPalestinians into submission. They're not gonna finish off Hamas. And at the same time, by\npursuing this strategy, they're doing huge damage to their reputation around the world. - Well, I just, yeah, in\nthe wake of October 7th, given the geopolitical context, I think there's a lot of leverage to be the great ethical superpower that demonstrate power\nwithout killing any civilians. And use that leverage diplomatic leverage to push forward something\nlike Abrahamic Accords with more nations, with Saudi Arabia, push for peace aggressively, peace agreements, this kind of stuff, economic relationships,\nall of this kind of stuff. And thereby pressure the\nPalestinian authority, towards perhaps the two-state solution. - But I think what you're missing here, just in the Israeli case, is that the Israeli\nGovernment is not interested in two-state solution. And you wanna remember\nthat Benjamin Netanyahu, who looks very hawkish when\nyou look at him in isolation, doesn't look so hawkish when you look at him compared\nto the rest of the people in his cabinet, right? He almost looks like a moderate. He's got a lot of people who are way out to the right of him. And these people in this of\ncourse, includes Netanyahu, are not interested in\nthe two-state solution. So, the question you have\nto ask yourself is you, if you're Benjamin Netanyahu, and it's July 7th, late in the, excuse me, October 7th, late\nin the day, what do you do? You're not thinking about\na two-state solution. You're thinking about an\noccupation that's not gonna end. And the question is how do you\ndeal with the Palestinians, given what's just happened? - Well, there's people in the cabinet and then there's history. And history remembers great leaders. And so Benjamin Netanyahu can\nlook in the streets of Israel and see the protests and think of how history\nwill remember him. And I think a two-state solution is on the table for a great leader. - Well, it was there, was he the person who was\ngonna take advantage of it? I don't think so, but we'll see. - Well, at this point, I mean, at this point,\nit's very difficult. Like you said, 95% now\nor whatever the number is of protests. I think the window in which Israel has the ears of the world, it can do the big ethical peace action, action towards peace is, I think has closed or maybe\nthere's still a slither, but it's just the slippery\nslope of hate has taken off. It's quite depressing to watch. - Yep, I agree a hundred percent\nunequivocally depressing. - But of course, as you talk about the the US involvement is of critical importance\nhere for the United States. And the argument you make is that we should not\nbe involved in Ukraine at least to the degree we are. We being the United States and we should not be involved\nin Israel to the degree we are because it's stretching us too thin. When the big geopolitical\ncontender in the 21st Century with United States is China. Is that a correct summary? - Yeah, I think just on Ukraine, we should not have pushed\nUkraine to join NATO. - [Lex] Sure. - And once the war started, we should have worked overtime\nto shut it down immediately. - [Lex] Yeah, March. - March, right? And you remember, by the way, not to go back to Ukraine in great detail. In the fall, early fall of 2022, the war starts February, 2022. There's March, 2022,\nwhich we've talked about, which is in negotiations\nin the fall of 2022, I think it was in September, the Ukrainians had won two\nmajor tactical victories, one in Hassan and the other in Kiev. And at that point in time general Millie, who was the chairman of the\njoint Chiefs of staff said, now is the time to negotiate, because this is the high\nwatermark for the Ukrainians. Millie understood that things\nwere only gonna get worse and the White House shut Millie down and said, we're not negotiating. So, we have blown a number\nof opportunities here to head this problem off at the pass. But that's my view there and\nwith regard to the Israelis, my only point about Israel is that it would be better for Israel and better for the United States if we the United States was in a position, the United States was in\na position to put pressure on Israel from time to time. As Steve and I say in the book, we should be able to treat Israel, like a normal country, right? The fact is that countries\nsometimes do stupid things. This includes the United\nStates and Israel. And if Israel is pursuing a\npolicy that we think is unwise, we should be in a position where we could put pressure on Israel. That's our argument, right? But anyway, we goofed both\nwith regard to Ukraine and with regard to the Middle East. And we're now up to our\neyeballs in alligators in both of those regions. And as you described my view, this is not good, because the area of the\nmost strategic importance for the United States today is East Asia. And that's because China is there and China is the most serious threat the United States faces. - Do you think there\nwill be a war with China in the 21st century? - I don't know. My argument is there will be, there is right now a serious\nsecurity competition, and at the same time, there is a real possibility of war. Whether or not we avoid\nit is very hard to say. I mean, we did, during the Cold War, we had a serious security competition from roughly 1947 to 1989. And we thankfully avoided war, probably came the closest in 1962 at the Cuban Missile Crisis. But we avoided it. And I think we can avoid it here. Is it for sure? No. - You've said that China won't\nmove on Taiwan militarily, in part because it's, as you said, amphibious\noperations are difficult. Why will China not move\non Taiwan in your sense, in the near future? - Well, it's because\nthere's this body of water, called the Taiwan Strait, which is a big body of water. And getting across\nwater is very difficult, unless you can walk on water. - So, geography still has a role to play in the 21st century? - Oh, yeah, I think\ngeography's very important. Big bodies of water really matter. In an ideal world, you'd like\nto have the Pacific Ocean, between you and any potential adversary, 6,000 miles. - [Lex] Yes. - 6,000 miles of water. Hard to get across. - [Lex] Yeah. - If you're a country, and I'm a country and there's land between us, I can take my Panzer divisions and I can go right across the\nland and get into your country or attack your country. And you of course can\ntake your Panzer divisions and come across that same piece of land. But if there's a big\nbody of water between us, your Panzer divisions\ncan't go across the water. And then the question is, how do you get 'em across the water? And that's very tricky. And in a world we have lots of submarines and you have lots of aircraft, and you have missiles that are land-based that can hit those surface ships. It is very, very hard to\nattack across a body of water. And all you have to do\nis think about Normandy, the American invasion of Normandy, June 6th, 1944 coming in\non Omaha Beach, right? Oh boy, that was really difficult. - But there is a growing\nasymmetry of military power there that even though it's difficult. - That is correct. - [Lex] So, I guess- - That is correct. - So, obviously I had a\nconversation with Elon Musk and he says that China is quite serious, about the One China Policy, and it seems inevitable\nthat Taiwan will have to be, if you look at this pragmatically\nin the 21st century, it seems inevitable that Taiwan, will have to be a part of China. And so we can get there either\ndiplomatically or militarily, what do you think about the inevitability of that kind of idea? When a nation says this\nis a top priority for us, what do you think about them meaning it and what do we do about that? - There's no question it's\na top priority for them. And there's no question they mean it, but it's also a top priority for us not to let them take Taiwan. - [Lex] Why exactly? - Because it's an\nimportant strategic asset. Many people will say it's\nbecause Taiwan's a democracy, but that doesn't matter that much. It's because of two strategic reasons. The first is that if we\nwere to let Taiwan go, it would have hugely negative consequences for our alliance structure in East Asia. To contain China we need allies. We have an alliance\nstructure and our allies, Japanese, South Koreans,\nFilipinos, Australians, they're all counting on\nus to be there for them. And if we say we're not\ngonna defend Taiwan, the Chinese attack, they're gonna say, I bet\nif the Chinese attack us, the Americans won't be there for us. So, it would have a damaging effect on our alliance structure\nwhich we cannot afford, 'cause containing China\nis a wicked problem. It's a powerful state. You were getting to this before when you talked about China versus Taiwan. So, that's the first reason. Second reason is you wanna\nbottle up the Chinese Navy and the Chinese Air Force\ninside the first Island chain. You don't wanna let them\nget out into the Pacific. You don't want them dominating\nthe waters of East Asia. You wanna bottle them up again, inside the first island chain. And you can only do that\nif you control Taiwan. You don't control Taiwan, they get out, into the Philippines Sea, into the Pacific and the Western Pacific and\ncause all sorts of problems. - Well, you saying all that, you've also said the\nCentury of Humiliation. Japan and the United States are a source of that\nhumiliation for China. Don't you think they see\nthe other side of that? - [John] Absolutely. - And in the interest\nof avoiding a world war, I guess the question is how\ndo we avoid a world war? It doesn't seem like\nthe military involvement in the conflict between\nChina and Taiwan is the way - [John] Well, I don't want- - There's no good answers here. I'm just saying which\nis the less bad option. - Well, what you wanna do is you wanna make sure\nthat you deter China from invading Taiwan. You wanna avoid a war. You and I are in complete\nagreement on that. We don't want a war, but\nwe wanna contain China. We do not wanna let China dominate Asia. That's what the Americans are principally concerned with here. And it's with China's neighbors are principally concerned with. This includes the Japanese,\nthe South Koreans, the Filipinos, Australians\nand the Taiwanese. They don't want and we don't want China\nto dominate the region. So, we have to contain it. But at the same time and this should be music to your ears, we not only want to contain it, we wanna make sure we don't end up in a shooting match with the Chinese, 'cause this could be disastrous. So, you have to have a very smart policy. You have to build powerful military forces and you have to make sure\nyou don't do anything that's provocative. On Taiwan, for example, the last thing you want is\nfor the Taiwanese government to declare its independence. Because the Chinese have said, if Taiwan does that, we'll go to war. And of course, we don't want that. So, my view is you wanna smartly build up your military forces and you wanna do everything\nyou can to contain China and at the same time, not be provocative. - So, a big component of that\nis making sure your military, the US military is bigger\nthan the Chinese military. - Not necessarily. It's an interesting question. A lot of people think that to\nmake the Terence work right, you have to be able to beat the Chinese, and therefore you need\na much bigger military. And I don't think over time\nthat's possible, right? I think it's probably\nnot even possible now to beat the Chinese in a war over Taiwan or in a war in the South China Sea. I think what you want to do is\nmake it clear to the Chinese, either that there will be no winner. In other words, you don't have to win, but you wanna make sure\nthey don't win, okay? It's a lose lose proposition if they go to war over\nTaiwan or what have you. And if you can't do that, you think that they're so powerful that they're ultimately gonna win. You wanna convince them that victory, would be a pyrrhic victory. In other words, they would pay a godawful\nprice to win the war. You follow what I'm saying? So, (John coughing) excuse me. The best strategy for deterrence\nis you win, China loses. Second best strategy is\na stalemate, nobody wins. Third best strategy is they win, but they pay a godawful price. And the fourth possibility,\nwhich you don't want, is they went quickly\nand decisively, right? If that's the case, then you don't have much deterrence. - What does a world with China as the sole dominant superpower look like? I mean, a little bit\nunderlying our discussion is this kind of idea\nthat US is the good guys and China is the bad guys. First of all, dividing\nthe world into good guys and bad guys seems to\nsomehow miss the nuance of this whole human civilization\nproject we're undertaking. But what does the world look like where China is the\ndominant soul superpower in a unipolar world? - Well, I don't tend to think of the world in terms of good guys and\nbad guys as a good realist. I think that states are states, they're all black boxes. I don't discriminate between\ndemocracies and autocracies. But having said that, I\nam an American, right? And as an American, I'm interested in the\nsecurity of my country, the survival of my country. So, I want the United States to be the most powerful\nstate in the world, which means I want the United States to dominate the Western hemisphere. I want us to be a regional hegemony. And I wanna make sure that\nChina does not dominate Asia, the way we dominate\nthe Western hemisphere. It's not because I think\nwe're the good guys and they're the bad guys. If I were Chinese and I were in Beijing, and I was Xi Jing Ping's\nnational security advisor, I'd tell him what we gotta do is, make sure we dominate the\nworld or dominate our region and then do everything we can to undermine America's position in the Western hemisphere, right? That'd be my view. So, I guess you could\nsay I do view the world in terms of good guys and bad guys, 'cause I'm an American and I- - More like us and them versus- - Yeah, it's us and them. That's a nice way to put it. Yeah, it's us versus them, not so much good guys versus bad guys. - Is it possible to have a stable, peaceful world with a\ngood balance of power with where it's China\nand US as superpowers? It's a bipolar world, no longer unipolar. - Yeah, okay. So, you're hypothesizing a\nworld where they dominate Asia. - [Lex] Yeah. - And we dominate the Western hemisphere. - [Lex] Yep. - I believe there would be a great deal of security competition, intense security competition\nbetween those two superpowers. - The definition of intense matters here. So, it could be small, small military conflicts or it could be extremely large, unstable military conflicts, right? - Well, conflict, let's use the word war. - [Lex] Okay. - So, I distinguish between\nsecurity competition and war. And what I'm telling you, is you'll have an intense\nsecurity competition where there's no shooting\nor if there's shooting, it's mainly proxies that\nare doing the fighting. - [Lex] Got it. - Much like the Vietnam War, right? Or you could have a case\nwhere one of those superpowers was involved in a war against a proxy of the other superpower. Korean War, think the Korean War, the United States fought the Chinese who were allied with\nthe Soviets at the time. But a war between the\nUnited States and China, just like a war between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. That's what you really wanna avoid. So, I think you'd have an intense security competition, right? You'd have wars involving proxies of each of those two superpowers. And you would probably have some wars where one of the superpowers\nwas involved in a proxy, right? With the other superpowers proxies. - So, it seems likely then, if that's the case then it\nwould be Taiwan is the proxy and US fighting China\nthrough the proxy of Taiwan. - Well, that would\nassume the United States. But you wanna remember, you're hypothesizing a situation\nwhere China dominates Asia. - [Lex] Oh, already has dominated Asia. - Yeah, it's already dominated Taiwan. - [Lex] I see. Where do you find the proxies? Australia? - The Middle East could be a good case. - [Lex] Oh, wow. - Persian Gulf. - Oh boy. And then our discussion of Israel, becomes even more dramatically- - Well, Israel gets involved, I think in this scenario, if you're talking about a\nUS China competition, right? And you're talking about the Middle East, I think it's the Gulf, it's the Saudis, the Iranians,\nthe Iraqis, it's the oil. - Don't you think it could\nbe Israel versus Iran with some very 1984 kind\nof dramatic partnership of Iran, Russia, and China\nversus United States, Europe and Israel. - I think that's possible, yeah. - [Lex] Oh boy. - I think that's possible, yeah. Now that I thought, I mean, I hadn't thought\nabout it until you said it, but yeah, I think that is possible - Isn't that terrifying? - Yeah, well, that, in your scenario where\nChina already dominate Asia and we dominate the Western hemisphere. I think you start talking about\nwhere the most likely places that the United States\nand China go head to head or fight through proxies. I think it is the Gulf for the Middle East and the scenario that you posit. - I mean, one question I have, I don't know about you, but for me, unlike with the Soviet Union and I know I was born there, but even outside of that, the cultural gap, the laws in translation, the communication gap between\nChina and the United States, seems to be much greater than that of what was the form Soviet\nUnion and the United States. I see two cultures\nintermingling and communicating as one of the ways to\ndeescalate future conflict. - It's an interesting question. I mean it at a sort of an\nabstract theoretical level, my argument is that great\npowers act according to realist dictates and they understand\nthose realist dictates. And that could lead to\ncooperation or it can lead to war. It depends. I would say, just in the case of the Soviets, a lot of people describe the Cold War as an ideological\ncompetition above all else, it's was communism\nversus liberal democracy or communism versus liberal\ncapitalism, whatever. I actually don't believe that, I believe the Soviets\nwere realist to the core. I believe Stalin was a\nrealist par excellence. And that ideology did not matter much in Stalin's foreign policy. And I believe if you look\nat Soviet foreign policy after World War II,\nthroughout the Cold War, they were realists to the core. And I think in those days, the Americans were realists, right? A lot of liberal ideology\nfloating around out there. But the Americans were realists. And I think one of the reasons you avoided a shooting match between the United States and the Soviet Union from '47 to '89 was because both sides, I think understood basic\nbalance of power logic. US-China competition\nis somewhat different. First of all, the Chinese\nare realist to the core. I've spent a lot of time in China. I basically have rock and roll, I'm basically a rock\nand roll star in China. The Chinese- - You're kind of a big\ndeal in China, I love it. - The Chinese are my kind of people. - [Lex] Yeah. - They're realists, right? They speak my language. - [Lex] Yeah. - It's the United States\nthat is not very realist. American leaders have a\nvery powerful liberal bent and tend not to see the\nworld in realist terms. I believe, by the way, just going back to our\ndiscussion of NATO expansion, I think our inability to\nunderstand that NATO expansion was anathema to the Russians was do in large part to\nthe fact that we just, during the unipolar moment, didn't think of international politics from a realist perspective, and didn't respect anyone who thought about international politics from a realist perspective, if those various American administrations, starting with the Clinton administration had put their realist hat on, they would've understood that\nNATO expansion into Ukraine was not a good idea. But we had this thoroughly\nliberal view of the world that dominated our thinking. And it's gone way somewhat, since we've moved into\nmultipolarity, but not completely. And this makes me a little nervous, right? To pick up on your point. I mean, the United States\nis thinking about the world in ways that are somewhat\ndifferent than the Chinese who are real as par excellence. - So, that's fascinating. So, the Chinese are pragmatic\nabout thinking of the world and as a competition of military powers, all the ways in which you\ndescribed the realist perspective. So, I mean that's a hopeful thing, right? If we can achieve stability and a balance of powers through\nthat military competition. - Yeah, I actually think that's right, I think if the United States, just let me talk a little\nbit about the United States to get at the issue you're raising. If the United States pursues\na smart containment strategy, given what you just said and\nI said about the Chinese, I think we will avoid war. The problem with the Americans is it's not just the liberalism. It's the possibility that we\nwill pursue a rollback policy. In other words, during the Cold War, we pursued containment. It was, whenever anybody talked, about American grand strategy\ntowards the Soviet Unions it was containment,\ncontainment, containment. We now know from the historical record that the United States was\nnot only pursuing containment, it was pursuing rollback. We were trying to roll back Soviet power, to put it bluntly, we were trying to wreck\nthe Soviet Union, okay? And I would not be\nsurprised moving forward with regard to China if\nthe United States pursues a serious rollback policy. - So, you're saying throughout history, United States was always\ndoing that always? Well, where's that from? Why can't we respect the\npower of other nations? - 'Cause they may be a threat to us. - Well, I mean, you don't look, you don't respect the\npower of other nations. You fear the power of other nations. - Well, fear and respect\nare next door neighbors, depending on the neighborhood\nyou're living in. But I just mean it could be\nvery counterproductive to try, because if you can empathize with their, if you assume their rational actors, you trying to roll back will create, would lean into the uncertainty\nof potential conflicts, you wanna avoid the uncertainty of potential conflict caution, right? - Well, yes and no. Look, your point is you wanna empathize, you wanna be able to put yourself in the shoes of the other side. - [Lex] Yes. - I agree 100% with that, right? It's very important if you're\na first class strategist to be able to do that. But at the same time, there is this competition\nfor power taking place. And what you wanna do is maximize how much power you have\nrelative to the other side. And the other side wants to maximize how much power it has relative to you. So, you have this\ncompetition for power, right? That's taking place all the time and that's taking place at the same time, you wanna have empathy or you wanna be able to put yourself in the shoes of the other side. So, those two things kind\nof go together, right? - It just feels less threatening to build up your thing, versus try to hurt the\nother person's thing, the other group's thing. - Right, but if you\nbuild up your own power, you are building up your capability to hurt the other side. - Right, but like you, I guess you don't rattle the saber, just work on manufacturing sabers. - Well, that I agree with. I think that the United States, wants to make sure it has\na big stake in East Asia for purposes of containing\nChina and avoiding a war, right? Again, I wanna be clear, I'm not advocating that\nwe start World War III, but the point is, you wanna have a big stake and you wanna make sure that you don't overstep your bounds in terms of using that big stake. This is the danger with rollback, right? That you get too aggressive and you precipitate a war, right? And you also just have to be\nvery careful what you say. And to go back to your favorite argument, you wanna be able to have empathy or put yourself in the\nshoes of the other side, 'cause if you do something, you wanna think smartly\nabout what that other side, how that other side is\ngonna see your action and how they're gonna react, right? - And mostly focus on the carrots, have a giant stick laying around, but never mention it,\njust focus on the carrots. - Well, occasionally you have\nto mention the stake, right? - No, everyone knows the stake is there, - There is some truth in that, right? - I mean, yeah. But and words matter a lot. It feels, this current President Biden's\nmeeting with Xi Jinping and I think the wars exchange\nthere are really important. I have a notion that\nleaders can stop wars, just as much as they can start wars. - Well, leaders matter. There's no question about that. No question. But just on on rhetoric, you wanna remember that Putin has, on more than one occasion, very subtly rattled the nuclear sword. - [Lex] Oh, yeah. - And it has been very effective, because Joe Biden has paid attention. And Joe Biden wants to\nmake sure we don't end up in a thermonuclear war. And thank goodness he's thinking that way. So, all Putin has to do\nis mention the possibility of nuclear war, just to go back to Taiwan, switch areas of the world. If you're interested in containing China and you're interested in deterrence and let's go back to\nthose various scenarios where the Chinese win, we win, Chinese win but they do it at a costly, at great cost. One could argue that that\ndiscussion that I laid out before, didn't take into account nuclear weapons. And all President Biden or any of his successors has to do is just very subtly rattle or employ the nuclear threat and just sort of remind the Chinese that you start a war over Taiwan, it could easily escalate\ninto a nuclear war. You wanna understand we\nboth have nuclear weapons and if either one of us is put\ninto a desperate situation, we may turn to those nuclear weapons. And oh, by the way, Xi Jinping, you wanna understand that\nwe're out here in the water and using nuclear weapons in the water. It's not that it's not the same as using war nuclear weapons on lands. So, we may very well use them. I'm not saying we will, but anyway, a little\nsaber rattling, right? - Yeah. Let me just zoom out on human history. What makes empires collapse and what makes them last when they do? When you look at human\nhistory in your sense, thinking about the United\nStates perhaps as an empire. - I don't view the United\nStates as an empire. - What's the definite? So, to you empire as a thing that seeks expansion constantly? - Yeah, I think it's a country that incorporates different regions or areas around the world into sort of a giant sphere of influence, without incorporating those territories, actually into the state itself. So, you had this thing\ncalled the British Empire, and it controlled areas like India, North America and Kenya. Just to pick a couple\ninstances at different points. Singapore would be another example. Australia would be another example. So, these were all entities that were part of the\nBritish Empire, right? And the United States has\ntaken a stab at Empire, after the Spanish\nAmerican War for example, with regard to the Philippines\nand Cuba and Puerto Rico. But we never got serious about it. There's never been an American empire. This is not to say the United States is not an incredibly powerful country that goes all around the\nworld building military bases and stationing troops here,\nthere, and everywhere. But we're not running an empire the way the British Empire\nwas run or the French Empire. So, the question for me is,\nwhy did those empires go away? Why did the British Empire go away? If you ever look at a\nmap of the world in 1922, after World War I, it's truly amazing how much of that map is controlled by Britain, right? They had a huge empire\nand it's disappeared - Probably by far the biggest in terms of area empire in\nhuman history, I think so. - I think that's right. It almost has to be. - Yeah, right, It's crazy. - It crazy, yeah. And then no longer is the case. - Now, I wanna be clear, the Americans have wield that\nmaybe even greater influence than Britain did when it had its empire. But I don't believe we have an empire that bears any resemblance\nto the British Empire. So, the question is, what\nhappened to that British empire? What happened to the French Empire? What happened to the Belgian Empire? What happened to the Dutch Empire? These were countries that had\ncolonies all over the planet. The Dutch East Indies, right? Vietnam was French Indochina. Where did those empires go? Two factors finished them off. Number one, nationalism. Nationalism became a very powerful force in the 19th century. It began to rear its head\nin the late 18th century and became a very\npowerful force in the 19th and certainly in the 20th. - Can you explain nationalism here? - Nationalism is the idea\nthat these different nations that were part of the\nempire, like the Kenyans, wanted their own state, nation state. This is my point about\nthe Palestinians, right? This is Palestinian nationalism. What is Zionism? Zionism is Jewish nationalism, Jewish nationalism. Think of Theodore Herzl's famous book. It's called \"The Jewish State,\" nation state. Think of the word nation state that embodies nationalism, nation state, Jewish state. Palestinians want their own state, two-state solution, right? Can't beat the Palestinians\ninto submission, right? The Indians wanted their own state. The Pakistanis wanted their own state. The Kenyans wanted their own state. Singapore wanted its own state. Oh, the Americans wanted their own state. This is called the American Revolution. - [Lex] Yep. - Right. So, that's the first reason, nationalism, that these empires disappeared. The second reason is that\nfrom a cost benefit analysis, they no longer made any sense. And it was the coming of\nthe Industrial Revolution. Once the industrial revolution comes, an empire is basically an\nalbatross around your neck. I would argue that the British Empire was an albatross around Britain's neck in most of the 20th century. Some of my friends disagree with that and think there were all sorts of benefits from the British Empire. But you wanna remember\nthat in the 20th century, the three countries that\nreally were powerful were the United States,\nGermany and the Soviet Union. Those were the big three. Did any of them have an empire? No. - That's a good card. - In the industrial world, you don't need an empire, right? What you need is a powerful\nmanufacturing base. - Well, the cost benefit\nanalysis is different. Before the Industrial Revolution,\nthere's been many empires. - There's no question that\nempires came and went, right? I mean, right? You have to do is just look\nat the British and the French in the seven years war. 1756 to 1763, the British win. They get Canada, right? And that's why Quebec, Montreal, all these big French speaking, areas are now part of Canada, right? So, borders change and\ncountries got established. The United States being one and remember South American\nand Central America were once completely\ndominated by the Spanish. And in the case of Brazil, the Portuguese. But they all in the 19th century, got their independence, right? And what I'm saying to you is in the 19th and in the 20th century, there were two forces that\nwere really driving the train. One is nationalism and then the other is the\nindustrial revolution, which changes the cost-benefit analysis. - Almost too crazy of a question. But if you look, let me calculate, let's say, 500 years from now, and you John Mearsheimer\ntraveled through time and are at a bookstore, looking at the entire\nhistory of human civilization in a single book. What role does US play? Like what's the story of\nUS over the next a hundred, 200, 300 years? Is it a big role, small role? - Well, that's a long time. If you asked me, let's just\nsay the next hundred years. - Yeah, that's still tough. - Okay, I think, that's still tough. But actually, I think\nwe're in excellent shape. And here's the reason, going back to the beginning\nof our conversation, you asked me about power. And I told you the two principle\nbuilding blocks of power are population size and wealth, okay? And therefore, you wanna\nlook around the world and you wanna look at what\nyou think the demographics are of countries like Britain, the United States, Iran, China, Russia pick your country moving forward, right? What do the demographics look like and how wealthy are those\ncountries likely to be? What you discover very quickly is that almost every\ncountry around the world is depopulating over time, right? Russia's gonna be much smaller. China's gonna be much smaller\na hundred years from now than both of those countries are as best we can tell. United States, American women are not having\nlots of babies these days. No question about that. But we have immigration. We're an immigrant culture. You're a perfect manifestation of that. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - You're a perfect,\nyou're now an American. That's wonderful. We need more people like you, right? So, when I hear Donald Trump and others arguing that\nimmigration's a terrible thing, this is ridiculous. - [Lex] That's fascinating. - Immigration is what\nmade us great, right? It's when my relatives\ncame over in the middle of the 19th century from\nGermany and Ireland, right? - That's fascinating. Like because there's there's\nbeen a huge concern in America and other developed nations\nand not having enough children. But you just made me realize in the long arc of history, the United States has\ngotten really damn good at integrating immigrants and\nlike helping them flourish. The whole diversity that makes up America. - [John] You're absolutely right. - There's a machinery of\nintegrating other cultures. - Yeah, just very quickly on this. - [Lex] That's fascinating. - Sam Huntington's book, \"Who are We?\" Which in many ways, I love that book. But it has one fundamental flaw. And a number of people told him beforehand that that flaw existed\nand he didn't fix it. But Sam argues in the book that we have large numbers\nof Hispanics in this country and we're doing a very poor\njob of integrating them into the mainstream. And they're not becoming Americans. And because many of them are concentrated in the southwest of the United States, unlike other ethnic groups\nthat were spread out, all over God's little green acre, right? We're gonna have this cohesive group of Spanish speaking Americans, right? Who are gonna want to break away. And the United States is no longer gonna be a\nreasonably coherent nation state. He's wrong. All the evidence is that\nHispanics are integrating into the American mainstream more quickly and more effectively than\nthe European immigrant groups that came starting around 1835. If you look at immigration from Europe into the United States, leaving aside the original Wasps who came over and founded the place, the immigrants start coming\nin large numbers in 1835. And we really don't shut\nthe door until 1924, right? Starting this is a crude\noverview starting in 1835 and running up till about 1885. It's mainly Germans and Irish. That's why Germans are\nthe largest ethnic group to ever come to the United States. And the Irish are right behind them. These are the European ethnic\ngroups we're talking about. Then starting in 1885, Poles, Jews and Italians\nstart coming, right? And the Germans and Irish keep coming. And this is why Ellis Island\nis opened, I think it's 1893. Ellis Island is opened because\nCastle Garden in New York, which had handled all\nthe previous immigrants, coming across the pond, Castle Garden couldn't handle them all. So, they opened up Ellis Island. That's why somebody like me, I can't find my distant relatives\nrecords in Ellis Island, 'cause they came through\nCastle Garden, right? Whereas lots of Jews I know, lots of Italians I know they could find their relatives\nrecords in Ellis Island, 'cause they came through Ellis Island. The point is, you had all these immigrants who came in roughly between 1835 and 1924 when we shut the gates. It was the only time we've\never really shut the gates in a meaningful way, right? And this is what made\nAmerica great, right? All these people and they\nmade lots of babies, right? - So, in some sense, make America great again means\ngetting more immigrants in? - Well we opened the gates again in '65, closed them in '24, opened 'em in '65. I'm oversimplifying the story here, 'cause we didn't completely shut them. We almost completely shut\nthem in '24, opened in '65 and we've had huge numbers\nof immigrants flowing in. These immigrants who have\nbeen flowing in since '65 are not Europeans. They're not mainly Europeans, they're mainly Hispanics and Asians. If you look at those Hispanics and Asians, they're integrating into\nthe American mainstream at a much faster and more effective clip than was the case with those immigrants who came in in the 19th\ncentury and early 20th century. The Irish, oh my God, they\nwere treated horribly. There's a book a very famous book that's been written called\n\"When the Irish Became White.\" Just think about the title of that book. - [Lex] Yeah. - There was discrimination\nagainst all these groups, right? And the worst discrimination of course was against Chinese Americans, right? But we've gotten much better. And what we should do moving\nforward is redouble our efforts to integrate immigrants into\nthe American mainstream. Hispanics, Asians of all sorts, because the fact is that America is rapidly reaching the point where it's not gonna be an\nall white country, right? I have five children and\ntwo of my children are, I was a generation Z, gen Z. Gen Z is the last majority\nwhite generation, right? Subsequent generations\nare not majority white. So, for anybody who's bothered by this, I'm not bothered by that. But for anybody who is bothered by this, they've better get used to it, because Americans aren't\nmaking enough babies that we can continue\nto grow population wise in a robust way. So, we need immigration and\nwe're an immigrant culture. And this is a great virtue. It has been a great virtue over time. - It should be a source\nof hope, not worry. - That's my view, that's my view. And America, when it works, is a place that is very\nattractive to immigrants. And immigrants can do very well here. And then the real key moving forward is intermarriage, right? And you have a huge amount\nof intermarriage, right? Somebody was telling me not too long ago that the highest intermarriage rates in the United States\nare among Asian women. Asian American women. Asian women and Anglos, right? And I say wonderful and- - Great. - Yeah, no, the more- - Love is the fastest way to integrate. - Yeah, well you don't, what you wanna do is you wanna\neliminate difference, right? You wanna eliminate difference, right? It's like people who say\nI'm an anti-Semite, right? I have two grandsons who\nAdolf Hitler would've thrown into a gas chamber. One of whose first name is John and middle name is Mearsheimer, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - This is what you want, right? - [Lex] Yeah. Steve Walt's wife and his two children would've\nbeen thrown into a gas chamber by Adolf Hitler, right? This is what you want. You want intermarriage. Now there are a good number of people in some of those groups,\nespecially among Jews who don't like intermarriage, right? But they've lost, because I haven't looked\nrecently at the data among, for intermarriage rates\namong basically secular Jews. But it used to be around 62%, large numbers of Jews marry Guam. - And they've lost\nbecause of intermarriage. Intermarriage helps fight tribalism. Destructive kind of tribalism, it's nice. - Calling me an antisemite. They haven't met my\ngrandsons, my son-in-law, a niece that I have, nephews that I have. Brother-in-laws that I have, Jewish, right? Come on. - And this gives a really\nnice hopeful view of America is the integration of different cultures, different kinds of peoples. That is a unique property of America. - Yes, but just to go\nback to where we started, it was not smooth in the beginning. - All things are rough in the beginning. - All things are rough in the beginning. - What advice would you give\nto a young person today, about how to have a career\nthey can be proud of or a life they can be proud of? - Well, I think it's very\nimportant to make sure that you do something in life\nthat really interests you. My mother used to use this\nphrase, floats your boat. You wanna do something\nthat floats your boat or to use another one of\nmy mother's phrase is, you wanna do something\nwhere you get up outta bed in the morning with a\nbounce in your step, right? So, I think that if your mother and father\nwant you to be a lawyer and they're pushing you to be a lawyer and you don't want to be a lawyer, you want to be a policeman,\nbe a policeman, right? Don't do what other people want you to do, 'cause it's very important to find a job, an occupation that you really love. The second thing I would say and this has to do with\nyour point about humility. You wanna think about the\nHumility-Hubris Index. My friend Steve Van\nEvera who teaches at MIT, he and I invented this concept. We call it the Hubris-Humility Index. And you want to have a\nhealthy dose of humility, but you also want to have\na healthy dose of hubris. You want to think you\ncan change the world. You want to think you can make\nthings better for yourself. You want to take chances. You wanna think sometimes that you know better than other people do. Hubris is not a bad thing. But at the same time, you\nhave to have humility. - [Lex] Yeah. - You have to understand\nthat a man or a woman has his or her limits and you\nwanna listen to other people. You wanna be a good listener, right? So, always remember the importance of the Hubris-Humility Index and the importance of having healthy doses of both hubris and humility. - Speaking of humility, you're mortal, like all humans are, do you ponder your mortality? Are you afraid of it? Are you afraid of death? - I'm not sure I'm afraid of death. I don't want to die because\nI enjoy life so much. - [Lex] Having too much fun? - Yeah, given how horrible\nthe world is today, I hate to say that I'm\nhaving too much fun, but do I find what I do\ninteresting and gratifying? I do, I just love what I do and I love studying\ninternational politics. And I love being intellectually curious, about all sorts of subjects. I love talking to you about this and that. I mean, this is really wonderful. And I often tell people thank\ngoodness I'm only 28 years old because I do try to behave\nlike I'm only 28 years old. But I am well aware of the fact that as my mother used to\nsay, nothing is forever and that includes me. And when you're 75 going on 76, you understand that you have a\nlimited number of years left. And I find that depressing, because I've been very lucky and I feel like I've won the lottery and I'm very thankful for that. And I'd like to make it last\nfor as long as possible. But I do understand\nthat nothing is forever. - Yeah, the finiteness of things. - Yeah, you never think\nthat when you're young. I mean, you think you're\ngonna live forever and you're just not gonna get old. I never thought this would happen that I would become 75 years old. - Well, you got so much energy\nand boldness and fearlessness and excitement to you that I'm really grateful to see that, especially given how much\nI'm sure you've been attacked for having bold ideas and presenting them and not losing, yeah, not losing that youthful\nenergy is beautiful to see. - Thank you. - Not becoming cynical. John it's a huge honor to speak with you that you've given me so much time and so much respect and so much love. This was a really incredible conversation. I thank you so much for\neverything you do in the world, for looking out into the world and trying to understand it and teach us. And thank you so much for\ntalking with a silly kid like me. - It was my pleasure. Thank you very much, I\nthoroughly enjoyed it. - Awesome. Thanks for listening to this conversation with John Mearsheimer. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you\nwith some words from Plato, \"Only the dead have seen the end of war.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
