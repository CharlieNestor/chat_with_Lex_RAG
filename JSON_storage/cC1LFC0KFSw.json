      "text": "- I was on the run for four\nmonths, stole $600,000. I was in Las Vegas, Nevada one day. The night before, I'd\nstolen 160K out of ATMs. The next morning I woke up, signed on to cardersmarket.com, which was ran by Max Butler, the Iceman. And there's my name, US Most Wanted on it. And that gets your attention. It was my real name with the\nUS Most Wanted beside of it. Nobody knew my real name\nin that environment at all, but then they did. And it was talking about me being part of the Secret Service\nOperation, AnglerPhish, everything else. So, of course they're all like-\n- So everybody's after you. - They're like, oh yeah, we're\ngonna get the son of a bitch. - The following is a conversation with Brett Johnson, a\nformer cyber criminal who built the first organized\ncyber crime community called ShadowCrew. That is the precursor to today's darknet and darknet markets. He's referred to by the\nUnited States Secret Service as quote, \"The Original\nInternet Godfather.\" He has been the central figure\nin the cyber crime world for almost 20 years, placed\non the US Most Wanted list in 2006 before being\nconvicted of 39 felonies for cyber crime, escaped from prison, and then eventually being\nlocked up, served his time, and now is helping people\nunderstand fight cyber crime. This was a raw, honest,\nemotional, and real episode. Brett has caused a lot of\npain to a lot of people, and yet his own story is\nfull of trauma and pain, and also redemption and love. This is a good time to say that I have, and I will talk to people who\nhave served time in prison and perhaps people who\ncurrently are in prison. I will try to do my best to both empathize with the person across from me and not let them sugarcoat, explain away or dismiss the crimes they committed. This is a tough line to walk because if you close your\nheart to the other person, you'll never fully understand\ntheir mind and their story. But if you open the heart too\nmuch, you can be manipulated to where the conversation\nreveals nothing honest or real. This requires skill and\nwillingness to take the risk. I don't know about the skill part, but I'd like to take the risk. I always wear my heart on my sleeve. If I get hurt for it, that's life. As I've said, I want to understand what makes a person do these crimes, the particular characteristics\nof their temporary or permanent madness,\ntheir justifications, but also their humanity. I believe each of us have the capacity to become both the criminal and the victim, the predator and the prey. It's up to us to avoid these paths or to find the path to redemption. It's on each of us. It's our responsibility and burden of being human in a complicated and dangerous world. This is the \"Lex Friedman Podcast\". To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Brett Johnson."

      "section": "Early years",
      "text": "You were convicted of 39\nfelonies for cyber crime placed on the US Most Wanted list in 2006, escaped from prison. You built the first organized\ncyber crime community called ShadowCrew, that is the\nprecursor to today's darknet and darknet markets. And for all this, the US\nintelligence service called you the original internet Godfather. So first question, how did your career as a cyber crime criminal begin? - My life of crime begins\nwhen I'm 10 years old. 10 years old, man. Think about that. I mean, you were probably playing the robots when you were 10. You know, usually kids\nare doing the Lego bit, getting involved with\nsports, everything else. And with me, it wasn't like that. With me, I'm from Eastern Kentucky. Eastern Kentucky is one of\nthese, it's like parts of Texas, parts of Louisiana that if\nyou're not fortunate enough to have a job, you may be\ninvolved in a scam, hustle, fraud, whatever you wanna call it. Man, my parents, my mom\nwas basically the captain of the entire fraud industry. So this is a (chuckles) woman that at one point, she's stealing\na 108,000 pound Caterpillar, D9 bulldozer, (chuckles)\ntramming it down the road. You know, at another\npoint she's taking a slip and phone, a convenience\nstore, trying to sue the owner. We had a neighbor, she acted\nas a pimp for at one point. That's my mom, my dad- - Wait, wait, the\nneighbor acted as a pimp? - My mom prostituted. I mean, she acted as\na pimp for a neighbor. Her name was Debbie. And my\nmom used to sell her out. You know, Debbie needed money,\nand my mom would find men for her to sleep with for cash, and she'd take a part of the cash. - So, sounds like she\ndiversified the methodologies by which she hustled. - Very had that entrepreneurial\nspirit. (laughs) - [Lex] Okay. - We see that a lot with cyber criminals, that sense of being that entrepreneur. - So what was the motivation,\nyou think, for her? Is it money? Is it basically the rush\nof playing with the system, of being able to know the\nrules and break the rules and get away with it? - My mom's a complex character. There's no one single motivation. So my mom was the individual.\nShe's still alive. My mom was the individual\nwho tested people. She wanted to know how\nfar she could abuse you, and you come back and still love her. So, and that was with every\nrelationship she's ever had, she would cheat on the\nmen she was involved with. She would abuse the her\nchildren, me and Denise. She would-\n- Psychological, physical? - Oh, it was mental, emotional,\nphysical, everything. Everything. I mean, she, she used\nto beat me and Denise with belt buckles, you know, and that ended when (laughs)\nI forgot what we had done. It wasn't much, I think that\nit may have been the part where she accused me of\nstealing her marijuana, but she was hitting me\nand Denise, we were living in a single wide trailer at that point. She was hitting me and Denise. We were on the bed trying\nto get away from it. And Denise kicks her through\na closet, is what happens. And Denise stands up and she said, \"You're through hitting me.\" And that was the last time that mom hit us at that point. But- - So sorry to take us there. For people who know you, and people should definitely watch some of your lectures online,\nyou're extremely charismatic and fun and jolly and\nwhatever word you wanna use. But, you know, if we look at that kind of life, there's darkness there, there's struggle there. - [Brett] There's a lot of darkness. - So, how did you feel? If you go back to the\nmind of the kid you were with your mom, was there sadness? Was there things like\ndepression, self-doubt, all those kinds of things? Or did you see this crime, this chaos as ultimately, exciting? - You know, back then, I\ndidn't view it as exciting. Now it becomes exciting\nwhen I start being involved in cyber crime, cyber crime, all right? But back then, it was simply a means to an end was all it was. So, you take a 10-year-old kid, and the way I get involved in crime is, like I said, my mom was the fraudster. My my dad was a good guy. He just forgot he was this good guy. You know, he always had these principles. But his issue was is he\nloved my mom so much. He was scared of her leaving. So if she wanted to do\nsomething, commit crime, cheat on him, whatever, he\nwould pretty much just put up with it. I mean, this woman used to, she used to bring men home in front of him. Tell him that, \"Hey, I'm leaving you. I don't love you anymore.\nI want you to die.\" Blah, blah, blah, blah,\nblah. This was my mom. There were two instances where\nhe can't take it anymore. And the first instance I\nguess I was seven or eight. My sister Denise is a\nyear younger than I am. My dad actually files for\ndivorce, files for divorce at that point. My mom kind goes crazy.\nMy dad, I was with my dad. My sister was with my mother, because that's that\nEastern Kentucky mentality. You know, men stay with\nmen, women stay with women. So he was filing for divorce. Me and my dad, we were\nliving in an apartment. My mom was living with her grandparents and with her parents, bouncing back and forth between the two. And I remember I was sleeping in the bed. We had a single wide bed.\nMy dad slept on the sofa. I woke up one night and\nthere was some sort of ruckus in the living room. So I wake up and I walk\ninto the living room and my mom has a knife to my dad's throat. And basically, you're not\ngonna steal my son from me. My mom was this individual\nthat when she knew she went so far, like I said, she\nwas always this person that tested, well, can I do this to you? And you'll still come back. She was always also this person that if she went too far, she knew it. And she would always try to\ndivert that into something else. All right? So she knew at\nthat point she'd went too far. So what does she do? She gets up crying, goes to the bathroom and\npretends to slit her wrists. So that my dad, Ray will\nrespond to that, not respond to what she's just done to him.\n- Hmm. - That was my mom in a nutshell. And she had a history of\ndoing this kind of stuff. Motivations as far as fraud with her. I think with her it was, she was an LPN and a very good nurse, but she didn't want to\nwork was a lot of it. So with her, it was easier\nfor her to commit fraud. And when I say commit fraud,\nit was against businesses, against people. I remember at one point, she's buying over the counter capsules\nand emptying the capsules out and putting some other crap in there. And selling at a speed.\nAnd people are buying it. She did anything she could for money. And of course I get involved with that. What happens is, we were in east, we were in Panama City at that point. And my mom leaves my dad and (chuckles) the way she left my dad, my great-grandfather had died. My mom tells all three of us, \"Hey, I'm taking the\nkids and we're going back to Eastern Kentucky to\nattend the funeral.\" Well, that was her leaving.\nMe and Denise didn't know it. She didn't pack any, any\nof our clothes at all. She stores her clothes\nin the trunk of the car. And she leaves my dad and I\ndon't get to see my dad again for I think five, six\nyears, something like that. My mom, like I said, she used to bring men home in front of my dad. She would, (chuckles)\nhe'd sit there and cry and beg her not to do it. She'd do it anyway. When\nleaves them, she kept up that. So we were living at\nmy grandparents' house. My grandfather, he had\nconverted the house. He had raised the house up and built apartments underneath of it. So me and my sister and my mom lived in one of the apartments underneath. And that whole side of the\nfamily was just nuts. Was nuts. My granddad Paul, he would,\n(laughs) this is a man that he didn't want you\nto eat any of his food. So, you know, there\nwas no such thing as me and Denise going upstairs to eat. If he found out, me and\nDenise was taking a bath, we were allowed to bath and bathe in two inches\nof water one time a week because he didn't wanna\nhave to pay the water bill. - [Lex] There's rules. - The rules, you know,\nyou couldn't have the TV on when he went to bed at night, you had to have the television, the\nvolume you could watch it, but without volume. Because if he heard it, he\nwould get up in the middle of the night and he would\nkick the power breaker, turn off all the power on you. This the family, right? So my mom, she used to leave me and Denise at home for\ndays, man, for days. She'd go out and, you know, party and I mean, sometimes she'd\ntake me and Denise with her. We'd wait in the car, sometimes\nwe'd wait in the living room and she went and partied\nand everything else. Most of the time she left us at home and my entry into crime. Denise walks in one day,\nshe's nine years old man. She walks in one day and she's got a pack of pork chops in her hand looked at her and I said, \"Where'd you get that?\" And she's like, I stole it.\" And you know, it's like,\n\"Show me how you did that.\" So she takes me over and she\nshows me how she steals food, how she's stuffing it down her pants. So we start stealing food. I'm like, \"Hell yeah, let's do that shit.\" So start stealing food and we get to the point where\nwe're wanting a sandwich. Well, you can't stuff a loaf\nof bread down your pants. So there was a Kmart\nin the shopping center. I go over to the Kmart,\nget a hoodie off the rack, take the tags off of it,\nwear it out, work just fine. And the way you steal\nbread is you put the hoodie over your shoulder stuff a loaf of bread down the sleeve\nand you walk out with it. So we started doing that. - [Brett] How'd you figure that out? - Just thought pattern. - So you said there's like\nstrategic thinking here? - You know, you can't wear the hoodie and put the bread down here 'cause you might mash the\nbread when you zip it up or they might.\n- Yeah. We have to think through that. - You gotta think through it.\n- Okay. - But you gotta realize\nby, by this point I'm, hell, I'm already seeing\nwhat my parents are doing. You know, I'm already seeing. (laughs) - So plotting that kind of puzzle solving was something you already developing yourself individual-\n- Oh yeah. - 'Cause you're pretty young. - Yeah. 10 years old, pretty young. But seeing how they act,\nhow they respond to things and my mom, I guess you'd\ncall it a good thing, they never kept any of that hidden from the kids.\n- Yeah. - You know, there was no\ndiscussions behind closed doors. All that happened in front of everybody. - And from your young mind's perspective, seeing that kind of\ncrime, you basically... You know, a lot of us\nkind of grow up thinking there's rules you're\nnot supposed to break. If you see other humans\nbreaking those rules, then you realize those\nrules are just human made. - But it gets worse than that. I was in an environment where\nthere were no decent people. I didn't really meet\nmy first decent person until I was 16 years old. - [Brett] Who's that? - That was a high school teacher. So what happens is, you know,\nwe start shoplifting food. My mom finds out that\nwe've been stealing stuff and you know, she joins us.\n- What's that? - She joins us.\n- She join (laughs) - Yeah, she comes in, you\nknow, I've got television, I've got the Atari 2600, play the hell out of it.\n- Oh my God. - And she starts seeing this shit. She's like, \"Where'd this come from?\" And I'm like, \"Well, we found it.\" She's like, \"You didn't find that.\" Denise stands up, \"We stole it.\" My mom, \"Show me how you did that.\" And she gets her mom too, to join in. And she used to run me and Denise as these little shoplifters. We'd steal stuff for her, we\nwould distract security and her and my grandmother would steal stuff. They got caught doing that. But that's the entry into crime. And Denise, you know, I'm\nadamant and I kind of mean it. (laughs) But the truth is, I say, and I do mean it that I'm responsible for my choices as an adult. Alright? I believe that when you're a child, you can't control that the adults in your environment control what you do.\n- Yeah. - All right, once you're an adult though, your choices are yours. Now that being said, you can't dismiss that childhood influencing\nwhat I did as an adult. You can't do that. I mean, it was kind of written on slate that, hey, this guy's gonna\nbe this guy when he grows up. - That said, like, sometimes\nthat one person you meet, that decent person can\nturn the tides life. - Absolutely. Absolutely. So what happens is the abuse,\neverything continues on. When I'm 15, my dad was\nin Panama City, Florida. We were in Hazard, Kentucky.\nShe was dating this guy. She and my mom was this guy, this woman that the abuse would,\nit was crazy abuse man, just crazy stuff. She would tell me and my sister, you know, that she gave up her life for us. That she was gonna leave\none day and never come back. That we'd find her dead\nin a ditch someplace. She'd go out and date these\nmen and she'd come back and she'd talk about how\nthese men were abusing her. You know? So she'd be dating this\nguy and she'd come back and she'd start talking\nabout how he had tried to rape her, you know, trying\nto get me to respond to that. And I would respond to\nthat, make no doubt. I would respond to that. Well, what happens is, and\nI knew that, I don't know if I knew it was abuse\nat that age, alright. But I knew things were\nfucked up. (chuckles) And I was talking to\nmy dad in Panama City, and I really had it in my\nhead that I was gonna go down and live with my dad. And I called my dad one day, I was set to go to me and\nmy cousins were gonna go see a, \"Return of the Jedi\",\nthat had came out again in theaters. So I called my dad it a\nSunday, called my dad. And he told me he had\neither gotten married or he was about to get\nmarried to this woman. And basically, Brett\nJohnson wasn't gonna go down to Florida. I was gonna stay in Hazard. I had to call my dad from payphone. But the result of that was I walked into a hospital, got in an elevator, and a woman got in an\nelevator at the same time, and I snapped and beat the hell out of her right there and I was 15. Didn't really know what the fuck happened. Didn't really know, but just- - Anger came from someone. - Yeah, yeah. And you know, the elevator\nbeat the hell outta this lady. Turned out she looked\na shitload like my mom. But the elevator door was open. One of the security guards I\nplayed basketball with his son. So he saw me immediately. I knocked the hell outta him,\ntook off running, made it back to the house where my grandparents were. They didn't know what had happened. So I didn't say anything. About an hour later, Kentucky\nState Police, they pull up in the front yard and two of 'em get out, and I'm sitting on the front porch and me and my cousins and they start walking up. Well, everybody starts\nwalking outta the house. And I just remember\nsaying, what do you want? What do you want? Well,\nyou knew what they wanted. They wanted to arrest Brett\nJohnson and they arrested me. I went in and I told 'em everything. Spent three months in a county jail. They didn't have juvenile\nfacilities in that county. So I spent three months in solitary, went to trial, pled guilty to\nassault in the first degree. The judge sentenced me to time served and a psychological\nevaluation where they sent me to Louisville, Kentucky\nand spent 30 days up there. And they cut me loose. They wanted me to have\ncounseling after that. And they went to counseling,\nyou know, wanted to, but mom was like, don't need it. And (chuckles) so never\nwent to counseling. And I became this pariah in\nthe county, it's crazy, man. I mean, not a day goes by\nthat, I don't think about that- - [Lex] That moment in the elevator. - Yeah and what happens\nyou're 15, man, you're 15. So I go back to the high\nschool that I was in, and I'm this piece of shit. - So everybody knows the outcast? - Everybody knows, everybody knows. So I move, we moved. We were\nin Iceberg we at that point. I finish up the year\nthere and moved to back to Perry County which is where Hazard is. So we moved there and they've\ngot three high schools there. They've got M.C. Napier,\nthey've got Hazard High School, and then they've got\nDi Combes High School. So I was within Med Denise,\nwere within half mile of M.C. Napier show up there\nthe first day of school. And I met me and my mom\nand my sister were walking into the school and the\nkids won't let me in. The kids stand out there,\nhe's not coming in. So my mom starts raising hell and I'm like, \"No, let's\njust go, let's go.\" So from there, we went down\nto the city school Hazard and the principal tells my mom, \"Denise can come, he can't.\" So my mom wants to raise hell. And I'm like, \"No, just take me to this other school.\" So this other school is like 15 miles away and you know, country\nschool, country high school. So I go there and they accept me. And I walked in the first day, and this English teacher\nname's Carol Combs. I walked in and handed her the paper. I, she was my homeroom teacher. And she heard this voice is\nthe way she explains it today. She heard this voice and\n(laughs) she looks up and she was like, \"Son, have you ever\ndone any drama before?\" (both laughing) And I'm like, \"No ma'am, but I'm interested in the academic team.\" I was this quick recall guy, right? And she was like, \"No,\nshe's like drama.\" (laughs) And I'm like, \"No, I'm\nnot interested in theater. I'm interested in academics.\" Well, she was the head\nof the drama department and head of the academics department. So the deal was, tell\nyou what, you can get on the academics team if\nyou start with theater too. And I was like, \"Okay.\" So what happens is, she was\nthe first decent person I met in my life. And she became this kind\nof surrogate mother to me. So under her tutelage, I become the one of the top academic team guys\nin the state around there. I was captain of the team. I was, this just scourge\nacross all the counties in that part of Kentucky. If, you know, we had a meet. It was like Jesus Christ,\nthat's Brett Johnson. (laughs) And you know, it was like, she used to tell people\nthey would, the high school that I came from was Weisberg. And the first time that\nWeisberg came against us, she told me I was talking\nto her about a year ago and she told me, she's like, \"Brett.\" She said, \"that first\nmeet against Weisberg.\" She said, \"the captain\ncame in, looked at you and said, 'oh, you've got that\nJohnson boy on your team.'\" And she said, my response was, \"That\nJohnson boy is our team.\" (both laughing) So, but I did that. And then with theater, I\nended up, my senior year, I won best actor and actress in the state. Only God ever do that in the\nstate. So did pretty well, man. Did pretty well. Had scholarships coming out of high school and everything else. And I'm the idiot that turned them down. - Ask you a funny question? - Yeah. - I mean, of all the many\nthings you could probably do, you would make a hell of a actor. - I'm very good on stage.\nI'm very good on stage. - Have you acted\nprofessionally anywhere or not? - Not, not professionally. We've done the college\ncircuit, stuff like that. What happened was, is, so I turned down the\nscholarships, you know, scared of leaving, I guess is what it was. Started community college. And the community college there hires a new theater director out of California. Well, he knew the guy that ran the San Jose\nState Theater program. A guy named Edward Emanuel was\nhis name. His claim to fame. He had written the three\nninjas movie. Remember that? The three little ninja\nkids back in the '80s? He had written this film and it had made a shit load of money. So he invites Ed Emanuel to\ncome down and see the play. And Ed had written this civil war piece. So we put that on, I was doing like, it was a multiple role thing. I was doing like 18\ndifferent roles in the show. So Ed sees the show and he\nwas like, \"Scholarship.\" He said, \"look.\" He said, \"Right now you're\na big fish in a small pot. We'll make you a big fish in a big pot.\" And I was like, \"Deal.\" So I took the scholarship man. And he was like, \"I'll\nbe back in two weeks.\" So he flies out. Two weeks\nlater, this guy flies back in. He drives down to where I'm living. I'm out shooting ball with\nmy cousins and friends. He pulls up and he gets outta the car. And I was like, I'm walk over to him. I was like, \"Hey man, I'll walk in.\nYou can meet my parents.\" He's like, \"No, I got\nit.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" So I keep shooting ball. He walks in the house,\nstays about 15 minutes, walks out white as a sheet. Doesn't say a word to me,\ngets in the car, leaves. I don't hear from him again.\nHad no idea what went on. Takes me a couple weeks. What happened is my mom, he walks in, introduces himself, my mom\npulls a knife on the guy. \"I will kill you. You are not gonna steal\nmy goddam son from me.\" Scares the guy to death. He bugs out and kind of broke\nmy spirit at that point. I was like, okay. So went into just full fledged into scams, crimes, everything else. I had already been, when I was a minor, I'd already been kind of\nbrought up on that side of the family with the\ncrimes that they were doing. And my mom was, you know, drug\ntrafficking, the pimp stuff, illegally mining coal, charity fraud.\n- Illegally mining coal. - Yeah. - Can you explain that? - Yeah, so to to properly mine coal, you have to get a permit, all right? Eastern Kentucky, a lot of people, they can't afford the permits. You know, they can get\n'em a piece of equipment, you know, you get a dozer, a loader or whatever you're gonna get\nor an auger or what have you. So you start mining, but\nyou don't get the permit. So you don't have to pay\nback, then it was like $3,500 for a two acre permit or\n$5,000 for a two acre permit. Let you strip mine the coal on that. Then you have to pay for the\nreclamation on top of that. So once you uncover the pit,\ntake the coal out, you have to cover back up the pit sew\ngrass, make sure everything is environmentally friendly. You got a silt pond,\neverything else at that point. - So the whole idea is\nyou buy an acre of land or some area of land and there's a whole\nprocess you're supposed to go through.\n- Entire process. - How many people are\ninvolved in a mining? The smallest number of people required for a mining operation? - You can do it with three or four people.\n- Okay. - So you've got your loader operator, you've got your dozer operator, you can farm out the trucking\nto someone if you need an or trucking company,\nif you need to do that. Then you've got whoever\nowns the business as well. So very few people can\nrun an operation like that and profit fairly well\nas long as you don't have to do the reclamation, all\nthat crap on top of it, right? The reclamation gets pretty expensive. So if you're uncovering a\npit of coal, you know, a pit. So a ton of coal is basically\nabout 36 cubic inches is what 2000 pounds of coal weighs if you're in Eastern Kentucky. 'Cause it's at the weight of the by two minutes coal and everything. - The fact that, you\nknow, this is awesome. (Brett laughs) The fact that you know exactly\nthe volume of a ton of coal. I mean, this is great.\n- Yeah. (Brett laughs) You learn this shit. You rattle this off. So you uncover the pit and\nyou've gotta sell the pit. Well the thing is that where are you gonna sell the coal? Well, you sell it to one\nof these other coal tipples that knows that they're\nbuying the shit illegally. So back then a ton of coal was, that'd give you like 36 bucks\nper ton is what that is. And you'd have to go out and\nyou'd test the BTUs on it. You'd take a sample to the lab test the BTUs, you'd take that into company.\n- BTU? - What's British Thermal Unit. So you'd test what the BTU on the coal was.\n- How pure the coal is. - How pure the coal is. What\nBTU it burns at back then. A good BTU was around\n12.9 was what you'd get. Alright? So 12.9 coal, $36 a ton. You'd take that sample\nover to the coal tipple. They'd say, \"Okay, we'll buy this for you. How many trucks you got\nor how many tons you got?\" And you'd say, \"This is what we've got.\" Then you'd hire the trucking company and where you get it out because you know, you've got\nthe agents that are looking for you by this point because the people that you\nknow, you've bought the rights to whoever the landowner is. You said you're gonna give them $2 a ton or whatever this is. Well, there are other people there. Are you paying them off or are you not? Well, if you're not paying\nthem off, guess what? They know your ass is mining it illegally. They're gonna report you. Well, all of a sudden you've\ngot all these inspectors that are coming around and everything and \"Hey, we know what you're doing.\" So they're looking for\nyou to get the pit out. So when do you get the pit\nout? Right dead of night. (laughs) So, you know, you're\nloading it up two o'clock in the morning, hauling this\nass out, is what you're doing. And you sell it out from there. - And your mom ran operations like this? - [Brett] Yeah. Yeah. - And you said you worked the mine too. - Yeah. When you were younger,\nlearned how to run a loader, run a dozer, learned how to\nclean off a pit, (laughs) everything like that fact. So this is the lifestyle you grow up in. You know, you learn how to do this stuff. And so knew how to do\ncharity fraud as well. Insurance fraud.\n- Charity fraud. Can we break down some of these are? - Charity fraud, it's much more romantic than what it sounds. (both laughing) It was basically, it was\nbasically standing beside the road with a sign and a bucket.\n- Yeah. - Taking up collections\nfor homeless shelters for abused women for\nchildren, stuff like that. Then later on I branched\noff, when I started off on my own, I would set\nup my own charity company and do some telemarketing. Go on buy and collect\nchecks and things like that. - You know, we're gonna talk about that. But actually, can we just step back and talk about your mom?\n- Sure. - And your dad. Given all of that, given all\nthe abuse, the complex ways that she played with love.\n- Right. - To see how far she can push\nyou and the people around her. And they still love her\ntoday. Do you love her? - You know, I called my dad yesterday. My dad, he's dying now.\nHe's got a heart condition. He's not gonna get the\noperation to fix it. So he is like, \"Fuck it, I'm ready to go.\" And I'm like, I looked at him. 'Cause hell, I'm 52 now, and prior to 52, I'd have been like, no,\nyou need to do this. But I looked at him and I was like, \"I understand, I\nunderstand you're done.\" And so he is not gonna get the operation. I was talking to him yesterday and he asked me, he is like,\n\"Have you seen your mom?\" And I was like, \"Dad, I've not talked to\nher for about two years.\" And I told him, I was\nlike, \"I love my mom, but my mom is not a\ngood person, she's not.\" And he told me, I was talking\nto him on the phone yesterday and he told me that it\ntook him several years to really understand that. He loved her too. But when you're getting abused\nlike that, especially my dad. My dad came from a good\nfamily, everything else and, you know, upstanding family. And (chuckles) I think that\nwhen you're that victim of abuse, you know, you've\nnever seen it before. You've never encountered it. And then it happens where\nyou're like, that frog in water all of a sudden. You get to the point\nwhere gradually increases until how do you get out of it? Everybody else sees what's\nhappening. But you don't. I grew up in that environment though. So it took me a long time\nto come to terms with that. My sister came to terms\nwith it long before I did. You know, my sister, she's been a decade without talking to my mom. Like she had tried to commit\nsuicide. I didn't know that. What got me so bad is\nshe said at one point that she always thought\nsomeone was gonna come in and save us. And my response, just immediate response, not even thinking about it. My response was, \"Well, Denise,\nI knew no one ever was.\" And looking at things now, I think that's where our path's diverged. Me it was, if you're gonna do it, if anybody's gonna take care of you, you gotta take care of yourself. - [Lex] You're on your own. - You're on your own.\nYou know, it's up to you. And Denise has always been that that child that has expected someone\nto come in and save her. - Well and almost like\nit's all going to be okay. Somebody-\n- Yeah. - And it wasn't.\n- No. - Unless you-\n- Unless you make it okay, it ain't gonna be okay. - Are you able to forgive her, your mom? My boundary with my mom,\nthe reason I've not spoken with her over two years ago, I started this legal career of mine. I've been the guy who\nhas, I spent a lot of time thinking about my past and those choices and what brought those choices around. So I'm big about taking\nresponsibility for my actions. I truly am. I think it's really important\nyou have to do that. Well, my mom, not so much. So I was talking to her,\nyou know, she would start the conversation talking about she didn't understand why Denise\nwouldn't speak to her anymore. That was one of her tropes. So, and my response started to become, \"Well because you were the abuser and you spent your life doing that to her. So it's more healthy for\nher not to talk to you.\" - So she's still not able to see the flaws in her ways of the past? - No, not at all. So my ultimatum to my mom\nwas, \"Look, when you're able to admit that you abuse the\npeople in your life, accept that responsibility and be\nable to discuss it with me. We'll have a talk other than that, I don't wanna talk to you anymore.\" So for the first year it\nwas, you know, calling, cussing my wife out, cussing me out. I don't need you out, blah,\nblah, blah, blah, blah. And then finally it started to taper off. And she's never really\ncontacted me after that point. - Your dad is dying.\n- Yeah. - What do you take from the\nway he's taken on death? Just saying, fuck it. - [Brett] You know, it's the man- - And what have you learned from your dad? What do you love about your dad? - He's one of these guys that,\nyou know, like I told him, I told my dad about the\nabuse and everything else, so, you know, I told you\nabout the elevator stuff. - [Lex] Yeah. - But before that, man,\nit took me 40 years to talk about that. But it also took me 40\nyears to talk about... There was a point that my mom\nand dad would leave the house and I would urinate in the floor. All right? - Is like, out of anger? - No, no idea why, alright. But\nI would, piss on the carpet. Piss on the carpet, piss\nlike the little baski, right? (both laughing) That really tied the room together. - Dude, it really tied the room together. - I was talking about that. And this lady comes up to\nme after the presentation and she had a career previous\nto that where she dealt with abused kids. And she told me, she's like, \"Brett.\" she's like, \"it's a control mechanism. The only control you had was that.\" And she's like, \"kids do that.\" And I was like, \"So I'm not unique?\" She's like, \"No, you're\nnot unique in that.\" So that, you know, there\nthis whole history of abuse. Denise dealt with it\nby drinking, by trying to commit suicide, things like that. And then finally she escapes,\nI'm the kid that didn't. And not only that, my wife\npointed out to me that it's, again, it's that Eastern\nKentucky mentality stuff. You know, the males expected to do things. So with, with me it was\nalmost like I stepped up to take part in those crimes so that Denise didn't have to. And she was able to avoid all that. Other than that one shoplifting stuff. Denise doesn't break the law anymore. She goes off to be a, she's a good parent. She's an angry parent. She's a\ngood parent, she's a teacher. Good citizen overall. I was just the guy that\nkept right on going with it. - Kept on going. So let\nme ask you about that."

      "text": "So your life of cyber crime. (Brett laughs) In describing some of the things you did or knew about you said quote, \"I once stole several\nthousand dollars worth of coins from a family trying to sell them to put a new roof on their home. Another time I sent a\ncounterfeit cashier's check to a victim and he ended\nup being arrested for it. I lied to family,\nfriends, everyone I knew. I was a truly despicable person.\" - [Brett] True. - One of my Ukrainian\nassociates Script had someone who owed him money,\nkidnapped and tortured. He posted pictures of it online. Another member, Iceman, used to flood his enemies email\naddresses with child pornography, then called the police on them.\" That's some stories. Can you tell some of these\nstories that stand out to you that are particularly\ndespicable or representative or interesting?\n- Sure. - When you look back at\nthat defined your approach and who you were at that time? - Let me say that I did\nnot care about my victim. All right? I cared about\nme is what I cared about. It's rough to admit that you know, that you don't give a\nshit what you're doing to anybody else, you only care about you. But that's the truth of the matter. I didn't care about the victims. The lady that that wasn't\neven at the beginning of my career as a cyber criminal. That was right at the last of it.\n- Which lady? - The coin lady. I was by that point ShadowCrew\nhad made the front cover of Forbes August of\n'04, October 26th of '04 Secret Service had to shut us down. 33 people arrested six\ncountries in six hours. I was the guy that was publicly\nmentioned as getting away. What happened was, is I\nwas the guy, I had kind of invented this crime called\ntax return identity theft, and was stealing a lot of money. I went through all my stateside savings and ShadowCrew gets shut down. I don't have any way to\ncome in with any money. So I start running\ncounterfeit cashier's checks. Defrauding people with that,\nhaving them send products or bull and collections, what have you by COD collect on delivery. And I would pay with it with\na counterfeit cashier's check. This lady was on eBay. She had been collecting these\nsilver coins all of her life. The US currency used to be\nthe coins used to be silver. So she had a whole\ncollection of these things like, I don't know, 80,\n90 pounds of this stuff. And I'm a very good social engineer. So convinced her that I\nwas a legitimate person that send it to COD, you\ncan use my FedEx account to do that or my UPS account to do that. I'll pay with a cashier's\ncheck. You can take it in. Same as cash. She believed that she was even on the ad and we talked on the\nphone and everything else. She had told me that\nshe was a single parent and it was the only money that she had to put a roof on the house\nfor her and her kids. And I didn't give a damn,\nI didn't give a damn. What was more important\nwas me at that point. - Can I ask you a question\nabout the social engineering? So maybe specifics like\nthe methodology email, you said phone. Maybe you could discuss this process from a bigger philosophical perspective of what is it about human\nbeings that makes impossible to be social engineered,\nto be victims of fraud? - So first lemme say that, that I became a social\nengineer as a child. Alright? Because the adults\n(chuckles) in my environment as a child, I had to know\nexactly what they were thinking and be able to try to\nmanipulate that for survival. So I became a social engineer\nfor survival, initially. All right? And one of the things\nthat I've seen with a lot of cyber criminals is\nthe exact same thing. The really expert ones. They become a social engineer as a child. Then later on they use those tools to victimize others. Alright? - Which is fascinating because in order to understand what others\nare thinking, you have to be extremely good at empathy. So you have to like really\nput yourself in the shoes of the other person.\n- Absolutely. - And yet in order to\ndo cyber crime, you have to not care about the pain that might cause them\nonce you manipulate them. So you have to empathize and yet not care. - Exactly. And I would argue, I would argue that that is not a sociopath because a cyber criminal\nand I was no different. Most cyber criminals\njustify those actions. So the justification\nbecomes what's important. With me the justification\nwas, well I did it for my family, did it\nfor my wife, did it for my stripper girlfriend.\n- Yeah. - So, and I believe those-\n- That's good story. I heard that one that 'cause I care about love a lot.\n- Yeah. So the big picture of that is trust. How do you establish trust\nwith a potential victim? Alright? Now I would argue online that that trust is established\nthrough a combination of technology tools, social engineering.\n- Yeah. - Alright. So we trust our tech. You know, we trust our cell\nphones, we trust our laptops. A lot of times we don't\nunderstand how they operate, but we trust the news that\ncomes across the line. We trust the phone numbers that show up. We trust IP addresses. If we're advanced enough\nto look at an IP address where a domain or anything else like that. Criminals use tools to manipulate\nthat spoof phone numbers, spoof browser, fingerprints,\nwhatever that may be, whatever the tool may be, then that lays a base level of trust. At that point you shoot in\nwith a social engineering and lay whatever story that is. In order to manipulate that\nvictim to act not out of reason but out of emotion, all of a sudden. - This is fascinating about\nthe way humans interact with the world, which is\nyou're almost too afraid to not trust the world. You have to find a balance.\n- Right? - You have a lot of sort of conspiracy theories now\nabout distrusting institutions and thinking like everything around us. It's like I've been listening to people who believe the earth is flat. And you know, that conspiracy\ntheory is fascinating to me because it basically says that you can't trust anybody.\n- Right? - That like everything you hear is a lie. So you can live that life\nor you can live a life where you're just naively\ntrusting everything. 'Cause that life is kind\nof full of happiness if nobody screws you over.\n- Right? - Because you, you know, you meet people with the joyful heart and you get excited and all that kind of stuff. But if you do that too much,\nyou're gonna get burned. So you have to find some\nkind of balance in terms of optimizing happiness where\nyou trust, I mean, but verify. And on the internet that\nmay becomes really tricky. You're almost too afraid\nto distrust everything 'cause you'll never get anything done. on the internet.\n- Right. - But then if you trust too\nmuch, you can get screwed over. And so the social engineering\ncomes in where you're like, yeah, I'm not sure\nif I should trust this. You kind of help them\nbuild the narrative was like, it's good, it's good. - So, and a lot of the times that social engineering is just feeding into what the victim wants to believe.\n- Yeah. - All right? It's not really coming up\nwith a brand new story at all. It's just knowing what the motivations of that victim is feeding\ninto it at that point. So you have to again,\nthat social engineer has to almost immediately know what's driving that person that they're talking about. So if I'm working on a phone, talking to someone over the phone, I have to know within seconds what I need\nto say, how I need to act to interact with that\ncustomer service agent or whoever I'm talking to on\nthe other end of the line. - So fascinating because\nyou truly are empathizing with the other person.\n- Absolutely. - What is it? This businessman Steven\nSchwartzman I've talked to a few times. He mentioned this thing that, the way you build deep relationships is you really kind of notice the things that people are telling you. Like, like what what they want\nand what they're bothered by. What are their big\nproblems in their lives. 'Cause everybody's\nsaying that all the time and most of us are just ignoring it. - Right, but if you take the time to listen.\n- Yeah. - You know, somebody at that point. - Yeah. - Absolutely you do. Then you have to be able\nto dismiss it. (laughs) - [Lex] Dismiss it after. - You're looking for that just\nto see how I can manipulate that is what you're trying to do. So that the lady was one story. The another truly despicable story. We'll get to Script in a second.\n- Yeah. - But another truly\ndespicable story we were one of the really first groups\nthat started phishing attacks. - [Lex] What's phishing? - So that is a social engineering attack.\n- PH by the way. - Yeah, PH that's another\nsocial engineering attack that's sending that fake\nemail out that looks like it's coming from a website or your financial organization or whatever and saying, Hey, we've\ngot a security problem. We need you to update\nyour account information. Well back then, no one had\never seen a phishing attack. So you could ask for all the\ninformation you were getting just complete identity\nprofiles on a phishing email. Nowadays you can't do that. Nowadays you look for\nbasically credentials because everyone is aware of phishing. But back then it was complete information. We had phished out, I don't know, 200,000 E-Trade accounts is what we had. The login credentials for the-\n- Login password, yeah. - Login password complete, you\nknow, social date of birth, mother's maiden account\ninformation, everything else. So we had access to\nthose E-Trade accounts. E-Trade initially had\nno security in place. So you could cash out the\naccount ACH the money out to whoever to whatever account you wanted to went through just fine. Ate 'em alive on that\nfor four to six months. E-Trade got to the point where you couldn't do any ACH coming out. You know, they locked everything down. Well you're still sitting on\nthousands of E-Trade accounts. How do you make money on that? - Hmm, that's a good question. - Yeah, so what you do\nis you find some fat cat that's got his retirement, you\nknow, invested in blue chips. Same time you find a penny stock, you open up a brand new account,\nbuy into that penny stock, cash the fat cat out, buy\ninto that same penny stock pump a dump schemes all of a sudden.\n- Wow. - So you're destroying\npeople's retirement accounts for just a few thousand dollars. Bam, bam, bam.\n- Wow. - And of course E-Trade\nresponse is not our problem. It's your problem, you shouldn't\nhave give up your password or what have you at that point. And you still see that\nissue today with Zelle scams and things like that. - Which scam? - [Brett] Zelle. So, you know,\nthe instant payment that- - Oh, so it's the same kind of operations with different payment mechanisms. - You find an easy way\nto exploit a system. And typically, the financial\norganization not our problem. Our system's secure. It's the\nhumans, it's their errors. Well, not really. You've got some culpability in that and you're just trying\nto avoid paying the part of the bill is what's going on. - One of the things just to stand phishing for a bit is it really makes me sad 'cause there's been people\non all kinds of platforms, like including YouTube\ncomments, but emails too. They figured out emails somehow. So people are now seeing the followers of this particular podcast or fans, they're finding them on platforms\nlike LinkedIn and YouTube and so on, and they are\nfiguring out ways to get to those people by another channel.\n- Right? Which I suppose seems more authentic to those people.\n- Right. - So they send them an email\nfrom what looks like me and with this like loving me. The interesting thing, the emails sound like something I would write. At this stage, it doesn't feel automated or if it's automated,\nthere's a human in the loop that's really fine tuning, to specific or maybe I'm very predictable, but it's very loving in the\nway I would write a message. (laughs) - And so think about that. All right. So when phishing first comes out, you could look at the language\nof the text or the website and say, eh, if you were\npaying attention that that's so, okay, so that's not an English speaker\nwho wrote that typically. Alright. But as time has went on as the awareness of what a phishing attack\nlooks like, we have people that are sitting down now and making sure that the language is proper. It gets worse than that though. If you look at business email compromise. Alright, so the way a business\nemail compromise typically works is the attacker will\nfind a payroll person, find a CEO, he will fashion\na spear phishing email, which is, that's a phishing attack that's targeting one\nspecific individual, alright? So he'll fashion a spear phishing email. And the way he does that is\nhe pulls all the information he possibly can on that\nperson or that CEO. Maybe he'll spear that CEO just to get their login credentials to their email just to read the emails. And he'll go in there and he'll start reading all these emails. He'll specifically read the emails to the payroll department,\nsee what that relationship is. Are they talking about\ntheir kids, talking about relationships, talking about vacation? What are they talking\nabout? How are they talking? Are they friendly? Are they\nsterile? What are they doing? Alright, so then he decides,\nwell I'm gonna go ahead and spear phish this,\nthe payroll department as well.\n- This is good. - So then he spear phishes\nthem, gets those credentials. At the same time he\ncreates a Unicode domain in whatever the company name is. All right? So instead of that English\nalphabet, I, he's got that Russian letter that looks like an I but without the dot on top.\n- Yeah. - All right, comes back into the email, into the payroll email blocks\nthe real CEO's email, replaces that with the unicode email that he's got. And then sends out a message\nusing the correct language, the correct relationships,\neverything else, and says Hey, you know, we're\nupdating our account status. I need you to send this payment instead of the over here, they've\nset up a new account, send all payments over here now. And that is business emo\ncompromise in a nutshell. Alright? Works great. - Probably the larger\norganization, the more susceptible to that kind of attack. 'Cause there's a like a\ndistribution responsibility to where you're more likely to believe that okay, this other\nperson is responsible. I'm sure they secured everything.\n- Absolutely. - I'm okay listening to this.\n- All right. So that's business email\ncompromise and it those crimes. And that's one of the things\nyou see about cyber crime. Cyber crime is not really sophisticated. It's not, the attacks\nare not sophisticated. The stat is 90% of every single\nattack uses a known exploit. It's not zero day attacks.\n- Yeah. - They're out there. But if you're a criminal\nwaiting on a zero day to profit, you're gonna starve to death. The meat and potatoes are\nat 90% known exploits. - Well you're saying it's\nmaybe, you mean it's not technically sophisticated.\n- Right. - But it's social\nengineering sophisticated. - [Brett] Very sophisticated on that end. Very sophisticated. - I mean it's a fascinating\nstudy of human psychology. - That establishment of trust and then using that trust\nto defraud that victim, that is something. - Obviously all of these folks\nare really good at hiding. I wish you could tell their stories in a way, which is why you're\nfascinating is you're able to tell these stories now, 'cause it is studying human\nnature by exploiting it. But you get to understand like\nour weak points, our hope, our desire to trust others\nalso sort of the weak points and the failures of digital systems and at scale humans have to connect.\n- Right. - It's fascinating. This is a weird question\nasking for a friend (chuckles) is spear phishing itself illegal? What's the legality here? - Oh, it's all illegal. Absolutely, it is. - Absolutely. So here's what, okay, let me,\nlemme construct an example. So if my friend were to spear\nphish like a CEO, right? And get their information. And after they get control,\nsay of their Twitter account, they tweet something loving\nand positive, what's the crime? - [Brett] Unauthorized access, I'd advice. - What would be the\npunishment, do you think? - That becomes questionable. So no monetary loss or\nwas there a monetary loss? - [Lex] Probably not. - All right, so you have to\nfigure out who the victim is before charges are pressed. Now the crime would be\nunauthorized access. All right? But no real victim on that unless, you know, the person\nwhose account you took over takes, you know, exception to that. No monetary loss. - But there's not really\nstandard like fines. - [Brett] Probably nothing's gonna happen. - Right, right, right. So, I mean, that's kind of interesting. 'Cause it's, (chuckles) so\nwhen I got the ransomware, when I got the zero day\nattack on the QNAP, you know, they basically say the\ncriminal is QNAP the company for having so many\nsecurity vulnerabilities. You are the victim of QNAPs incompetence. That's the way they kind of phrase it. - I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that at all. So, SolarWinds. (both laughing)"

      "section": "SolarWinds cyberattack",
      "text": "- [Lex] Yeah. So I've got 130 page class\naction lawsuit printed out at the house. I've been going through it, that catalogs how SolarWinds lied for years about their vulnerabilities, and they lied to investors. The people who came out, the\nauditors who they would hire would, you know, they would\nnot pay attention to them when they said, you know,\nyou've got these issues. They would say, go away,\nshit like that for years until SolarWinds, you know,\nthe attacks become apparent. My view on that is that\nthe only person responsible for the crime are the\ncriminals who did the attacking the actual criminals. Not, not SolarWinds. Now does that mean the\nSolarWinds isn't fucked up? They are, and there needs to\nbe some accounting (laughs) in place, but the only individual, the only people responsible\nfor crime are the criminals. And that's either online, in the physical world, what have you. Being an idiot is not a crime.\n- A crime. (both laughing) - Being criminally negligent is. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I think that SolarWinds\nis certainly responsible. Not responsible, they're\nculpable for what happened. - Can you actually tell\nfolks about SolarWinds? What are some interesting\nthings that you're aware of? - Yeah, SolarWinds was very... It provided a backbone of security for hundreds, thousands\nof different companies. If you looked at a lot of security companies\nwere using SolarWinds that would allow you to get a snapshot of the entire system that\nthey were working on. So what happens is you get a\nRussian group that comes in and they basically, they\nhack into SolarWinds and they get access to it. And it allows them to\nview every single thing. I mean, every single thing\nabout every single client that SolarWinds had at that point. So, entire snapshots of all\nthe IP that was going on, all the emails, all the\ncommunications, every single secret that was going on with those companies, if a company had software like\nMicrosoft, it allowed them to look at the source code of\neverything that was going on. I mean, it was just a complete\nand total nightmare. Alright? And something that you are\nnot going to recover from. You're not, I mean,\nit's done at that point. You know, there's not been a\nlot of news lately about it, but the fact of the matter is,\nis that's the type of attack, that's a catastrophic attack. - So there's a huge amount of information that was read saved elsewhere, probably.\n- Oh, yeah. - And so now there's people\nsitting on information. - Absolutely. So think about one of the\nattack vectors has been Microsoft Outlook 365, things like that. This allowed the attackers to look at the source codes of that. So they have the source code now. So they go through it line by line, what are the vulnerabilities? Let's find new\nvulnerabilities, new zero days. You know, I said zero days aren't common, but this opens up an entire new threat surface all of a sudden. So it's a completely catastrophic attack. Once all the chips are down,\neverything's tallied up, people are gonna be like, yeah, we're done.\n- Yeah. (laughs) All right, this whole\ncomputer thing, we're tried it and we're walking away.\n- We're done. (laughs) So that's terrifying\nbecause, so you're saying that there's not been obvious\nbig negative impact from that yet, so, but like. - I mean, there's been a\nlot of negative impact, but we're just starting, - Right?\n- We're staring. - So the capacity for\ndestruction is huge here. How much involvement from nation states do you\nthink there is on this? - You know, it's interesting. So you've got Iran, you've\ngot North Korea, China, Russia, you got the big four, you also got Brazil.\n- Yeah. - You've got all these other countries that are interested in\nthe United States as well. Nation states are interesting depending on who the nation state is. Alright, so Russia's\nvery good about working with the type of criminal\nthat I used to be. You know, they'll enlist these guys and steal information or what have you. Then Russia will take the\ninformation they want to, and they'll basically go off and sell whatever you want\nto and make some money. China's all about IP, North\nKorea's about stealing money because they really don't know what the hell else to do right now. - So North Korea is actively\ninvolved in cyber crime? - Absolutely. They've stolen a shit load\nof Bitcoin, everything else. So absolutely they're\nactively involved with that. Very, very skilled\nattackers. Very skilled. But even if you look at, I\ntold you that stat about 90%. Alright, so even though SolarWinds is gonna be the number one\nattack, the follow up to that is this not petty\nattack that happened. And so that was the most\nsophisticated attack launched by the Russian Sand Worm group using all known exploits throughout. So again, it's not, you're right. And the sophistication is typically not technical sophistication, but it's that social\nengineering sophistication. How do you get these things put together in line to attack and succeed? - But when you get access\nto the source code, that's where technical\nsophistication could really do a lot of damage. Oh yeah. And that's when you find out real quick, that's what separates the men\nfrom the boys in this game. Alright? Because all of a sudden\nit's not, I don't have to worry about social\nengineering, I've got source codes and I've got professionals\nthat are looking at that. And that's your ass. - Which then enables probably even more powerful social\nengineering methods too. I mean, it's just right cascade of,"

So you look at deep fakes, you look at fake news, all this stuff that's going out that\nbecomes truly terrifying. - Maybe there's an\nangle where it's freeing if nothing is true and\nyou can't trust anything. (Brett laughs) - But you see, we as human\nbeings, we want to trust. We do, we need human interaction. And for that human interaction, you have to have a degree of trust. - But it's more like you let\ngo of an idea of absolute truth and it more becomes like a\nblockchain style consensus. So you let go of like, you know what? There's this human dream. You know, you get this on the\ninternet, you get like facts as if there's at the\nbottom, there's one turtle that's holding this like scroll that says, these are\nthe truths of the world. The problem is, I mean, maybe believing that is counterproductive,\nmaybe human civilization is an ongoing process of consensus. And so it's always going to\nbe, everything is shrouded and you can call them lies or\nyou can call them inaccuracies or you can call them delusions. It's constantly going to be, it's going to be a sea of lies and delusions. But our hope is to over\ntime, develop bigger and bigger islands of\nconsensus that allows us to live a stable and happy society. Don't call it true, call\nit a stable consensus that creates a high quality of life for the habitants of the island. (Brett laughs) - I like it. I mean, I like it. I mean, that's where we're\ngoing to agree on this. - And then don't use Outlook.\nNo, I'm just kidding. So maybe a step back,\nyou mentioned I'd love to talk about ShadowCrew. Maybe this is the right\ntime to actually... - Yeah, let's go to ShadowCrew. It's such a fascinating story. So tell me the story of building\nShadowCrew the precursor to today's darknet and darknet markets. You're, this is why you're\nthe original Godfather. - This is it. - [Lex] This is it."

      "text": "- So I get married. I faked a car accident to get married. Got the money from that. - [Lex] You're romantic. - I'm romantic like my dad, man. I'm the guy that, you know, I get from mom, I get the criminal mindset. From dad. I get that.\nDon't want him to leave. (laughs) - So you get married. - [Brett] I met this girl. - What's that story? - [Brett] Oh dude, I was- - How did you fall in love there? My first girlfriend was\na preacher's daughter and crazy over her. Dated her for five years. And she figured out pretty quickly that, well, not quickly,\nit took her five years to figure out that Brett\nJohnson is not the man of God. (laughs) I could talk it, but more\nthat agnostic than anything. She breaks up with me. So I\nwas at the community college. - You'd make one hell\nof a preacher by the- - [Brett] Thanks. (both laughing) Yeah. - So I've got that\nLangston Hughes problem, I'm looking for Jesus to\nshow up and he just doesn't. (both laughing) So I was at the community college and I was a straight asshole. I was arrogant, conceited everything else. And I had posted an advertisement on one of the billboards looking\nfor an adult babysitter, hot blonde, you know, come\nvisit me in the library. Buddy of mine shows up\nand he is like, \"Brett.\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"The hottest girl\nin school right down the hall.\" And I was like, \"Serious?\"\nHe's like, \"Yeah\". And I was like, \"Let's go see.\" (laughs) Walk over and there's these two guys that are hitting on her. So I just walk up and me\nand Todd, that was my buddy, walk up and I'm just\nsitting there and listening and they're, you know,\nthey're giving the spiel and everything and she's\njust kind of taking it in. Finally I looked over and I was like, \"You wanna get outta here?\" And one of the guys looks\nat (laughs) me, he's like, \"Hey, we're talking to her.\" And I was like, \"Well,\nyou're talking at her. You're not talking to her. I'm about to save her ass from you.\" - [Lex] Yeah. This is a smooth\npickup line, by the way. If I ever hear one, that's good. You wanna get outta here? - So start dating and she was the girl that screwed my brains out man. And I fell, I head over hills. We got married six\nmonths later. Six months. - [Lex] That's what love does. - That's what it does. And she didn't know I was a crook. She had no idea. You know,\nshe knew I was very bright. She knew I did a lot of\ntheater stuff like that. Got a job at, I was in Hazard.\nThere was no jobs to be had. So I got a job in Lexington 'cause we were gonna be moving to UK. Got a job in Lexington at\nLexmark, testing printer boards, circuit boards. So I would leave on a Thursday night, work three 18 hour shifts at\nLexmark, come back home on on Monday, got married,\nfaked a car accident to get that the rest of the money\nthat I needed to get married. And the faking on that man,\nI had bought a Chevy Spectrum at a car auction, gave\nlike 500 bucks for it. My aunt had previously\ndefrauded USAA insurance on a car accident. And she was telling me all about it. She's like, look, go down\nto this chiropractor. Make sure you get the\ninsurance where they'll pay for a rental car. They'll pay lost wages. I was\nlike, they pay lost wages. She's like, \"Yeah, they pay\nlost wages.\" I was like, \"Hmm.\" She's like, \"By the way, you work for me.\" And I was like, \"I work for you.\" - And you get to define\nthe wage and you can also define how long\nyou were unable to work. - Exactly. Exactly. And the chiropractor will\nsign off on any damn thing. Alright. So my cousin Ronnie, he\nfigures out that I'm going, he finds out I'm gonna\nfake this car accident. So he comes to him, he's like, \"Hey man, can I get in on that?\" I was like, \"Yeah, man,\nyou get in on that.\" So this kid, he's five days\nyounger than I am. This kid. He goes to the dentist\nthe day that we're faking. It has a tooth pulled, tells\nthe dentist not to numb it, not to stitch it, just pull it. So he shows up, he shows up the day that we're driving out\nto fake the accident. He is got blood all over his shirt. He is still bleeding outta\nthe mouth and everything else. I'm like, \"Are you okay?\" And he is like, \"Yeah\nman, it's gonna be good. It's gonna be good.\" I'm like, \"Okay.\" So my mom by this point, I'm\nliving with my grandparents. My mom is up in the head of a hollow. So we're like, \"We'll just do it up there. We'll go act like we're visiting my mom on the way back out, ran over a mountain.\" I was like, \"okay.\" So we go visit and everything,\ncome back out that night, run over the side of the hill,\nme and Ronnie walk back up, of course it totals the car. Walk back to my mom's\nacting like we've wrecked. She knows what time it\nis and everything else. And file the claims. So that gets the money to, to get married. And me and my wife move\nfrom Hazard to Lexington. And I'm the kid that my crime, usually, if I was a single guy,\nwouldn't break the law, wouldn't I would be all right. You know? But females involved, oh yeah, oh yeah, I gotta spend the money,\ngotta show 'em gifts. Everything else was never enough to show love in some sort of healthy way. Always had to go overboard. And typically it was buying some or stealing some sort of expensive frat. - So that was the thing. That was the way you show love\nis by buying expensive gifts. - Right? Or something overboard. Back then with Susan,\ninitially it was don't worry about working, I got it. You just worry about going to\nschool. She was a music major. I was like, \"You just worry\nabout going to school, so don't worry about\ncooking and cleaning.\" I got it, I got it. So not only was this guy\nthat was going overboard, but I was kind of a\ncontrol freak too, right? So, no, I got it, I got it, I got it. So here I am, you know, 60 hour week job, 18 hour class load cooking and cleaning. Something had to give. I quit the job. I couldn't do it. Quit the job and start back in fraud and trying to hide that\nfrom her at the same time. So it was initially telemarketing fraud. Started, I was working at,\nthe first job I had was a telemarketer at a cemetery\nselling grave sites. And then that ended, went over to work for the Shriners Circus,\nShriners Hospital. And there was a third party company that was doing all the telemarketing. Made really good money doing that. That job ended and then\nthey pivoted over to working with Kiwanis Clubs, selling food baskets to the food banks and everything. So I stole the phone list and started at my own Kiwanis Club and would do the telemarketing,\ngo out twice a week and pick up checks. Well, what happened was is I'm\ngoing out picking up checks, go knock on a door. Turns out one of the persons that I had called was a\nlaw enforcement officer. So he was like, \"Who are you?\" (laughs) I'm like, \"I'm with the Kiwanis Club.\" And he is like, \"No, you're not.\" (laughs) So got arrested, spent three\nmonths in a county jail for theft by deception,\ngot out and we had to move from Lexington back to Hazard and live with Susan's parents. They had gotten a desktop computer. HP and I started surfing\naround online, found eBay, and didn't really know\nhow to make money on eBay. About the same time I'm committing\nlow level frauds online. I don't really talk\nabout that in the past, the first time I've\nreally talked about that. But I would pay for it with bad checks. - So not using a platform like eBay more? - I would find somebody that\nhad like a stereo system on eBay, something like that. And I'd pay for it with a bad check and would rely on them not to chase me or because they were outta\nstate at that point. And the dollar amounts were very low. So got the money to move to\nfinally did those schemes enough to get the money to\nmove back to Lexington. Got to Lexington. And by this point, I'm, I'm\ndoing these, like I said, these schemes on eBay and I'm like, there's gotta be a better\nway to make money on eBay. Gotta be. So, didn't really know how. One night I'm watching Inside\nEdition with Bill O'Reilly and they're profiling Beanie Babies. So I'm sitting there watching\nand the one they're profiling is this one called Peanut: The\nRoyal Blue Elephant selling for $1,500 on eBay. I'm sitting there going like, shit I need to find me a peanut. (laughs) So my initial thought was, well\nthere's gotta be one in one of these Hallmark stores\nin Kentucky someplace. So I skipped class the next day, went out around all the Hallmark stores looking for peanut, no idiot,\nhe's on eBay for $1,500. So after a few hours of\nthat, I'm like, \"Hmm.\" Turns out they had little gray\nBeanie Baby Elephants for $8. Picked up one of those for $8, stopped by Kroger on the way\nhome, picked up a pack of blue Rit dye, went home,\ntried to dye the little guy. So that was a nightmare. Turns out they're made out\nof polyester, got 'em out of the bath, look like\nthey've got the mange. And what happens is, I'm\ntrying to die the thing. And I'm like, well that's not gonna work. That's just not gonna work. So\nI got online, found a picture of a real one, posted it\non eBay, and I was like, well, what I can do is I can claim that's the one I've got. And then maybe claim that it got messed up in the mail and work out like that. So, posted a picture of a real one online, woman thought I had the real thing. She wins the bid that\nsocial engineering kicks in immediately. I didn't want to, I didn't\nwanna be on the defensive. I wanted to put her on the defensive. So as soon as she wins the\nbid, I send her a message, Hey, we've not done any business before. I don't even know if I can trust you. What I need you to do protects us both. Go down the US Postal\nService, get two money orders, totaling $1,500, send them to me, issued by the US government. That way we're both protected. Soon as I get the money orders,\nI'll send you your animal. She believed that, didn't\nask any questions at all. She believed that, sent\nme the money orders, I cashed 'em out, sent her the creature, immediately got a phone\ncall, \"I didn't order this.\" My response, \"Lady, you\nordered a blue elephant. I sent you a blueish elephant.\" And she got pissed and she kept calling. What I found out, and that's\nreally the first lesson of cyber crime that\nmost of these criminals, including self learns, if you\ndelay a victim long enough, just keep putting 'em off. A lot of them, they get\nexasperated, throw their hands in the air, walk away,\nyou don't hear from 'em. And none of them to this\nday, none of them complained to law enforcement, they eat it. - It's a mixture of like,\nyou're exhausted by the process. So it's just easier to walk away and second, almost like an embarrassment. - So there's a whole slew of reasons. Alright, there's exhaustion. Certainly there's the embarrassment. So if you figure out, if you look at it today, where does the\nembarrassment come from? Well, the media family members\nwe're all very good about blaming the victim for crimes. Why would you click on the link? Why would you send money to somebody you don't\nknow, blah, blah, blah. So you've got, that's going on. You've got the issue of\nwho do you complain to? Back then, you didn't know, do\nyou complain to local police because she's in another state. So which local police do you complain to? Do you complain to the feds? Well, it's not, the dollar\namounts aren't high enough to complain to feds. Feds are gonna tell you to go local. Local's gonna tell you, Hey,\nit happened in Kentucky. Complain to them. Kentucky's gonna tell you,\nwell, shit, you're over there. We need you to come in. So there's this whole\nissue, the jurisdiction of the blame factor, everything else. So I got away with that crime\nand under my own name at that point, kept going\nand got better at it. Started to understand how to hide identities, things like that. Started selling pirated software. Pirated software led into\ninstalling mod chips. It was for the initial pirated software was Sega Saturn, PlayStation one. Well you had a have a mod chip in those to play the pirate to discs. So I started selling\nand installing mod chips that led into installing mod chips into cable television boxes. So you could watch all the pay-per-view, which in turn led into\nprogramming satellite DSS cards, those at HRCA satellite\nsystems pull the card out of it, program it, turns\non all the channels. Started doing that. - Can we just pause That\nis very entrepreneurial. So just technically, so\nthere's laws and rules"

      "text": "that you're breaking nonstop. So there's also legitimate\nways of doing that, which is break the rules of\nthe conventions of the past. That's the first principles thing. That's what Elon Musk and his ilk do all the time.\n- Right? - That is guts and brilliance. But when it's crossing\nthe lines of the law, actually sometimes the law is outdated. The thing is, as a human being have to then compute the ethical\ndamage you're doing, like ethically, the damage you're doing about other human beings. That is fundamentally the thing that you're breaking is you're adding to the suffering in the\nworld in way another. And you're justifying it. But in terms of me,\nsort of as an engineer, that is some gutsy thinking. That's how Was and Steve Jobs thought. - [Brett] Sure. - That's innovation. And maybe just think your, if you can introspect your\nthinking process here. This is a new, I like how\nyou remember this in HP, like this is a totally new thing to you. Computers is yet another domain. How are you figuring these puzzles out? Presumably mostly alone.\n- Alone. - When you were thinking through these problems-\n- Alone. - Is this is a strange question to ask, but you know, what is\nyour thinking process? What is your approach to\nsolving these problems? So the approach is, you do\nsomething and you fuck it up and you think back, okay,\nhow do I fix that? (laughs) So you fix that aspect,\nyou commit the crime again, and it goes a little bit further and it screws up, okay, how do I fix that? What's the issue on\nthat? How do I fix that? - So there's not a deep\ndesign thinking, like- - Later on it becomes that. Once you lay that groundwork of the way these schemes are working, all right, it becomes that. And you can apply that to other things in cyber crime as a whole. Alright? But initially it's,\nit's basically trial and error. You've got a problem. How\ndo you solve that problem? Alright, so I'm committing\nthese crimes under my name. How do I solve that? Well, one of the first principles\nthat we started to teach on ShadowCrew is all crimes should begin with identity theft. That's one of the main first\nprinciples that a lot of people to this day still don't really get. Alright, why would I commit\na crime under my name if I can do it under your name? So that's one of the big buffers. And that takes trial and error to get to that point where you start to understand that's the way crime should\noperate if you're a criminal. Alright? But with me, I mean it's trial and error. It's that childhood where that mindset is kind of ingrained in you. Where you're looking for ways, let's say non-traditional ways of getting around things\nor getting through things. - I mean, one of the questions\nI'll probably ask this later is, there's also a unique\naspect to the outcome of what you were doing, which\nis you didn't get caught for a very long time.\n- Right. - We'll talk about why that is. And the thing is, it's so interesting, all crime probably to be\neffective should start with identity theft.\n- Right. - I like that identity theft. 'Cause identity theft\ncan take so many forms, right?\n- Right."

      "text": "- So yes, so ShadowCrew. So you started with love. (laughs) - Started with love. (laughs) So now we're, you know,\ndoing these schemes online. I'm selling to these, I'm programming these satellite DSS cards. And you, one of the interesting things, and you still see that to this\nday, is something will happen that will create an\nindustry for criminals. All right, so what happened is Canadian judge rules about the same time that I'm doing these satellite cards. Canadian judge comes out\nand says, \"Hey, it's legal for my citizens to pirate those signals.\" And his reasoning is since\nRCA doesn't sell the systems up here, my citizens can pirate it. Okay? So (laughs) what happens\nis overnight about the same time PayPal comes into play. So PayPal's coming right\nonline at about the same time overnight little cottage industry pops up in the United States. You go down to Best Buy, buy the system for a hundred dollars, take it out in the parking lot,\nopen system up, pull it, open the box up, pull the\nsystem out, pull the card out, throw the system away,\nprogram the card, ship its to Canada, $500 a pop. Started doing that business\nis good making, you know, three, $4,000 a week doing that. I'm like, yeah, that's good. I have so many orders, I\ncan't fill all the orders. And quickly think to myself, why do I need to fill any of them? They're in Canada, I'm down here. (laughs) You know, who are they gonna complain to? Because I already found out\npeople don't complain. Alright? They're not gonna complain to anybody. So I start-\n- Especially in Canada. - Especially in Canada, and\nI'm having 'em send money. That's when PayPal's first into play and it amazes me that\neverybody is using PayPal. It's like you don't\neven have to really ask. They're like, \"Can we PayPal?\" \"Yeah, you can pay all\nday long by PayPal.\" And PayPal had no clue what\nthey were doing with security. So it's like, okay, so they're\nsending money to PayPal. I'm having the PayPal\ncashed out to bank accounts in my name at that point. And I get scared because\nby that point I'm stealing in four to $6,000 a week. And I'm like, somebody's gonna be looking at money laundering. So getting into my head,\nI'm like, best thing that I can do is get a\nfake driver's license, open up a bank account using that driver's license,\ncash out at the ATM. Good. No idea where to\nget a fake ID, not a clue. So I get online, looked around,\nspent a couple weeks looking around, thought I found a guy. He went by the screen\nnamed of Fake ID Man. Thought I found a guy. Sent him $200, sent him my\npicture, dude rips me off. (both laughing) I'm like what the hell? (laughs) - Got played. - Oh, I got played. He had a little, a website\nset up with reviews and I'm like, \"Oh, it's all legitimate.\" Yeah, he's building that\ntrust that I talked about. So the end result, I got pissed and there was no site that dealt with anything criminal\nor cyber crime related. The only real avenue you had was an IRC chat session, internet relay chat. And that, I'm sure you've been on that this, it rolling chat board. You don't know who the\nhell you're talking to. Most of 'em are full of shit.\nYou can't trust anybody. And you're sitting there\ntrying to conduct business. So you know, if somebody\nclaims they've got a product or service, do they have it? Does it work? Are they\njust gonna rip you off? Because in those channels,\neveryone, it's a criminal. I kept looking around and I happened upon a website\ncalled Counterfeit Library. And Counterfeit Library only\ndealt with counterfeit degrees and certificates as only\ndegree mill type stuff. But they had a forum and\nno one was using the forum. So I basically get on\nthere and bitch every day. I got ripped off, don't know what to do. Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. About the same time I start doing that, two other guys show\nup, one's named Mr. X, he's out of Los Angeles. Other guy's named BLS Above, he is out of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. And we all become buddies. So a few weeks of me\nbitching, them responding, BLS Above gets me on ICQ. And he sends me a message,\nhe's like, \"I went by the screen name of GOllum\nat that point, GOllumfun.\" And he's like, \"GOllum, I can make you\na fake driver's license.\" And I was like, \"Well, fuck do it.\" And he is like, \"Well I'm\ngonna charge you for it.\" I'm like, \"Yeah you are.\" And he's like, \"Yeah, I am.\"\nI was like, \"No you're not.\" And he is like, \"Look man.\" He said, \"this business, if\nyou're gonna do this, you have to trust people or you're gonna fail.\" He said, \"so I'm gonna charge you $200 but I'm gonna send you\na driver's license.\" Well by this point I'm friends with the people who own\nCounterfeit Library. We're emailing chat and everything else and I tell him, I'm like,\n\"Okay, I'm gonna send you $200 that way when you rip me\noff, I'll have them ban you and I don't have to\ndeal with you anymore.\" And he is like, \"Bet.\" I'm like, \"Okay.\" So I sent him $200, sent him my picture. Two weeks later I get a driver's license name was\nSteven Schwake out of Ohio. And real guy worked at a DP\npayroll to this day, works at ADP is where the guy works,\ngot the driver's license. And to me, at that point in\ntime, it was the prettiest thing that I'd ever seen. You know, I'd never seen a fake ID before. I thought it was great. Turns out, you know, looking\nback it was like, eh, so, (laughs) but- - Is kind of a strong first step in creating a fake identity. - [Brett] Very strong. Very strong. So this, so that was like- - Can I ask you, just on the point he made that if you're gonna be successful in this, you should have people you trust. He is he right on that? - [Brett] He's absolutely\nright. He's absolutely. - So you have to have, this is like mob.\n- You have to- - You have to have an inner\ncircle, that you trust. - You know, I'm sure you've probably seen, heard me say this before. Successful cyber crime. Alright? There are three necessities\nto being successful online. If you're a criminal, three\nnecessities are gathering data, committing the crime,\nand then cashing it out. All three of those necessities\nhave to work in conjunction. If they don't, the crime fails. The problem, and it's a huge problem, is that one guy can't do all three things. You've got the people who gather the data. Basically the general store sells. People who sell PII credit\ncard logins, data tools, they always sell the spoofed phone numbers or the RDPs stuff like that. A lot of the times those\npeople don't know how to commit the crime. And those people certainly don't know how to launder the money out\nand put cash in pocket. So you've got either\nbecause of a skill level, sometimes the geographic\nlocation limits what that individual can do. Alright? So you have to rely on people who are good in areas where you are not in order for that crime to succeed. And that means you have\nto trust those people. So what happens with ShadowCrew? Alright, so Counterfeit\nLibrary is the start. Alright? Counterfeit Library\ntransitions over to ShadowCrew. Right before that transition,\nthere's a Ukrainian guy by the name of Dmitry Golubov. He was a spammer at that point in time. He saw what we were doing with Counterfeit Library and he liked it. He was getting all these\ncredit card details and this kid, I mean he is\na kid, this kid has an idea. And his idea was, I wondered if people would buy stolen\ncredit card details. - It's pretty good.\nUkrainian Russian accent. - Thanks. So he picks up the phone,\nhe calls his buddies, they call their buddies. They have a physical conference in Odessa. 150 of these cyber criminals show up. And they launched this idea. This launches a website\ncalled CarderPlanet, which is the genesis of all\nmodern credit card theft as we know it. Alright? And so remember I mentioned\nthose three necessities of cyber crime. Dmitry had all the credit data\nin the world and he partnered with all these other Ukrainians who had all this data as well. The problem was, is so much\nfraud had been committed on that eastern side of Europe that every card had been shut down. Even if you were a legitimate card holder and tried to cash it out,\nyou weren't doing it at that point. So again, those three\nnecessities gathering data, committing crime, cashing out. Dmitry had the data, they\ncould commit the crime, they could not put cash in pocket. So we were running Counterfeit Library. One day I get this\nmessage, or not a message. One day Script shows up and he posts just on the general forum. He posts, Hey, I've got credit card data. Give me an address, gimme\na burner phone number, wait five business days,\norder whatever you want to. We had never seen anything\nthat we were a PayPal fraud and eBay fraud site is what we were and fake driver's licenses. So the, and we had, I guess\nwe had two, 3000 members at that point. So the response from the\nmembers was, that can't be real. You've gotta be law enforcement. It's gotta be in trying to get us arrested and everything else. What, let me backtrack a little bit. So the driver's license that I had, got BLS Above had an idea. What he wanted to do is he\nwanted to sell driver's licenses. Mr X wanted to sell social security cards. He made a very passable\nsocial security card. Me, I had no skill level on that. I knew PayPal fraud and eBay fraud. So BLS was like, tell you\nwhat, you be the reviewer. That way you get every product or service that comes in,\nthey'll have to send it to you or let you have access to it. You can learn the entire game. And because you're not selling anything, it gives you legitimacy on the reviews. Alright, so I start out as a\nreviewer, the only reviewer on Counterfeit Library. So over the next year,\nBLS Above turns out he was a pot grower. He goes back to growing pot 'cause he wasn't making shit\nselling driver's licenses. Mr. X, about a year and a half in he gets arrested, cashing\nout driver's credit card, not credit cards. Cashing out to casinos,\ndoing some with that. So I'm the only guy left standing and I'm at the top of the heap. So, and it becomes this thing where if I review somebody,\nthey make a lot of money. If I don't, you don't do business here. So Script shows up saying he is got this, I'm the only reviewer on site. People think he's law enforcement. First week it goes like that. After a while I'm like,\n\"Okay, I gotta do something.\" And I'm scared man. 'Cause I'm like, he\nmay be law enforcement. So I get him on ICQ and I'm like, \"Hey, you\nhave to be reviewed.\" And he's like, \"What the hell is that?\" So I tell him what it is.\nHe's like, \"You review me.\" And I was like, \"Yeah, that's the idea.\" So give him a drop address,\ngive him a burner phone number. Wait five business days. And\nI try to hit Dell for $5,000. The order fails. I get back on\nICQ, Hey man, it didn't work. He's like, gimme one more chance. I was like, look, I'll\ngive you one more chance, but it's your ass after that. And he's like, \"One more chance.\" I'm like, \"Okay, give him another address, another phone number. Wait another five business days.\" Hit Thompson's computer warehouse for $4,000, Dell for $5,000. Order goes through, get the products in. I post that review on Counterfeit Library and literally overnight we turn from an eBay PayPal fraud\nsite to a credit theft site. And that becomes a lot of money\nreally quickly for members. So we were doing, now it's\ncalled CNP fraud card, not present fraud. So you hit, you use hit an online merchant with stolen credit card data. Back then a fairly experienced\nfraudster could profit 30 to $40,000 a month. Okay? Just buying, you know,\nlaptops, what have you. And cashing out, you know, put 'em on eBay for sale and selling 'em like that. And 30 to 40K a month\nwas the profit on that. Script had a lot of buddies. He had people like Roman\nVega, these other guys that would sell not just credit card data, but counterfeit physical\ncredit cards as well. - Counterfeit not stolen, so counterfeit.\n- Counterfeit. - That must be tough to do. - [Brett] So the connections- - Must be harder than what\nit's driver's license. - Of course. It's crazy. So you know, you're back. So what's what BOA initially had and I became the United\nStates salesperson for BOA. But what he had was is he\nwas the first dumps provider in the United States. So on the back of your credit or debit card, there's a magnetic stripe. Three data tracks on the stripe. There was the first data\ntrack is the customer's name. Second data track is\nthe card number/16 digit algorithm outside of\nthat, that's important. We'll get back to that in a few minutes. Third data track is called\nindiscriminate data. No one uses it. Alright, so what's bought and sold is the second data track. It's called the dump and the reason that's sold is when you go into a shop, you insert the\ncard or you swipe the card. The only information that's sent out for verification is the second data track. Alright? That goes to the\nprocessor bank for verification. The first data track that\ncustomer's name shows up on the screen of the\ncashier in front of you. So what typically happens is\nyou buy 10 of these dumps, you get 10 counterfeit cards in code track two on all 10 cards. Track one, you create one fake\ndriver's license track one is just the name of that\none fake driver's license. That way when you go in the\nshop, swipe the card track two gets sent off a verification track, one shows up on the screen\nin front of the cashier. If you ever ask for ID you pull\nout the fake ID, everyone's an ice swarm fuzzy. You walk out with the cameras Rolex. - And track one could be a, it\ndoesn't have to be connected. It's not connected to track two. - Not connected at all. Alright? That's one of the big problems. Alright?\n- Yeah. - So Script brought a\nhost of technical people into that type of environment. All committing credit card theft. We had proxy providers,\nwe had all these people that were doing this stuff. We start making a lot of money a lot. And the reason that happens is again, Script did not have the\nability to cash out. So he was reduced to selling things and at the same time he's looking for how do I make more money? Alright, the Ukrainians happened upon this thing called the CVV one breach or hack is what it's what they called it. So what happens is, remember I told you of track two card number forward\nslash 16 digit algorithm. You gotta know the algorithm to encode it. So you can swipe the card or\ntake it to the ATM machine. Alright? ATM, you gotta know it. Now we were phishing data from hell. I mean we were doing a\nlot of phishing, a lot. We were getting pins, we\nwere getting card numbers. But you can't get that algorithm. So the Ukrainians start testing stuff. What they found out was no bank had implemented the hash on track two. So you take the card number\nforward slash any 16 digits, it would encode, take it to the ATM, pull cash out\n'cause you got the pin. Alright, started doing that. - Wait, wait, sorry, I'm\ntrying to understand. So that means, so if there's no, are they generating random numbers or do they have valid\nnumbers for track two? - No numbers were needed at all as long as just the track two\nwas a complete track two. - So it's a valid track\ntwo that doesn't... So the pin is the thing that gets you in. So back then, alright, so back then what we're talking about is you need to, typically today you\nneed a whole track two, you need that valid track two, all right? You need the 16 digit\ncard number forward slash and then whatever that\nalgorithm has out beside of it. All right? Back then none of the banks\nhad implemented that algorithm. So while the algorithm was there, you didn't need it to encode. - [Lex] Interesting. - Interesting. - So you can't make a lot of money with physical of fake credit.\n- Credit card. Credit card not present. Fraud debit cards card not present fraud. Remember I told you was\n30 to $40,000 a month. - [Lex] Yeah. All right. That turned\ninto 30 to $40,000 a day. - [Lex] Yeah. - The Ukrainians, again,\nthey can't cash it out. They've got all the data on the planet but they can't cash it out. Those three necessities of cyber crime. So the deal became, you have\nto rely on the Americans. Tell you what, we'll give you 40%. So you had all these cashiers that were 40% of $40,000 a day. Yeah, we'll take that. Alright. Send the rest of it\nover to by Western Union or what have you to Ukrainian contact. That's before cryptocurrency\ncame into play. Now you had a couple of\nforerunners with E Gold and Liberty Reserve, things like that. But back then it starts out with Western Union, then\nit becomes prepaid cards, sending track information over loading the card up like that. And then finally you get\nto E Gold Liberty Reserve. And then today it's\nwith crypto that's used. Started stealing a lot of money a lot and that got law enforcement attention. So we started to see, I mean\nthis, it's a crazy story. We started to see IPs coming in from law enforcement agencies because back then they didn't know how to shield their identity either. (laughs) So you saw Secret Service, you saw DOD, you saw all these like, and you're like, that's interesting, you know? (both laughing) And at the same time we\nhad, it was called a hack, but it wasn't a hack. We had a guy that worked\nat T-Mobile in Los Angeles. This is the same guy\nthat back then published Paris Hilton's phone contact\nlist that made a lot of news. Not only did he do that, but it turned out that the Los Angeles Secret Service Agency was using T-Mobile phones. So he's getting text messages of the Secret Service\ninvestigating ShadowCrew and he posts those damn\nthings on ShadowCrew. So I'm sitting there\ngoing head of the pile, I'm sitting there going, this is not going to end well, this is not gonna end well. So at the same time I had\naccess, I started out with access to the Indiana State\nSex Offenders Registry and I was using that to create\nbank accounts lot the money out and I would sell the bank\naccounts and stuff like that. They shut that down. The next database I had access to was the Texas Driver's\nlicense database. And started using that to\ncreate fake driver's licenses, what have you. And then finally we happened upon the California Death Index. Alright, complete information,\nmother's maiden, socials, DOBs, all that. And it's like gotta be a use for that. Well you can use it to create\nidentities all day long. My idea was, I wonder if you could take somebody that's died and then file for social\nsecurity death benefit, not death benefits, but\nsocial security benefits for that individual and get\nthat recurring paycheck in. So that takes a lot of\nresearch to start seeing if you can do that. How does the federal\ngovernment know if you're dead? Do federal indexes\nreference state indexes? You got all these questions that pop up. Well it turns out federal indexes don't reference state\nindexes, it's against the law. So it also turns out the only\nway the federal government knows you're dead is prior\nto 1998, the family had to file a social security\ndeath benefit for that person. Alright?\n- Wow. Prior to '98. Of course most people don't. Right? Prior to '98 it took the family. After '98 the hospital can\ndo it, funeral home can do it or the family could do it. So a lot more people have it filed after, if they've died after. - But it's still, there's a lot of people probably-\n- A lot of don't because that death\nbenefit's only like $219. - Okay?\n- Yeah. - Nobody's thinking about that shit. So I started to apply for\nsocial security benefits. Nope, number's dormant. So they want you to come in\nfor a physical interview. Here I am, you know, 32,\nyou're not gonna pass as a 65-year-old, so no. So the next idea I had was wonder if you could file income\ntax returns on these people. Turns out you can all day long. So I started doing that and I started to steal once I got ramped up. 'Cause you test everything,\nyou know, you're testing to make sure you, I gotta figure out what the deposit instrument\nis and everything else. And once you get all\nthat lined out, I started to steal $160,000 a week every week for 10 months outta the year. - By paying taxes? (chuckles) - [Brett] By filing fake tax returns. - Oh yeah, filing fake tax returns. - So you find a business.\n- Yes. - And the way the system worked is the IRS will issue a refund on somebody before they're able to verify that that person worked for an employer. Still works like that today. Alright? - And you're keeping the\namounts relatively low? - [Brett] Keep 'em at $3,000. All right? Amounts are very low. - But you're still able to achieve scale because this large index- - Right, I got to where, and I was manual later\non, a couple buddies of mine went automated with it. - Wait, you were go doing this by hand? So there's no code involved. - All manual.\n- Wow. - I'd file a return\nonce every six minutes, work 10 hours a day, three days a week. - So typing fast and clicking- - One return every six minutes, that's changing IP\nthat's changing address. Everything else wanna return\nevery six minutes (laughs) for three days a week. Fourth day I would take a road\ntrip, plot out a map of ATMs and then the next two days cash out. Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.\nAlright, come back home. Rinse and repeat, turns\nout that a backpack, I don't see any sitting around here, but a backpack will hold $150,000 of twenties is what it'll hold. So I'd put 150K in twenties in a backpack. I had a spare bedroom, I'd come in, toss the backpack in the bedroom. - This is very, very\nimportant information. And the fact that you know it is also very-\n- Yeah. - First we started with the volume of coal that weighs a ton. And now a backpack coal $150,000 of twenties.\n- Yeah. - And then you can multiply that by five or hundreds. - Yeah. - I like this.\n- Well it's 20, most of the time it's 20. It's coming out ATM right? Each 20 weighs a gram.\n- Each 20 weighs a gram. - So you can actually\ngo by weight, which is what federal authorities\ndo when they get a pallet of cash, they just weigh it. - [Lex] Oh, do they just weigh it? Okay. - 150K is seven and a half\nkeys of cash. (laughs) - 15. Oh that's pretty light. - Not bad. Not bad.\n- Yes. You get big backpack, go do a good run with David Goggins with it.\n- Yeah. Nice. - I like it. So, and the\nfact you know this is great. So wait, where does that\ncome in with the backpack? - So what happens is, I didn't\nknow how to launder money. Alright. So, you know, I'm throwing\ncash in the spare bedroom. One day you open up the bedroom\nand you're like, (laughs) gotta do something with those backpacks. And that's when you start learning how to launder money, you know, cash based businesses, things like that. I had a production company, had a couple of detailing company, I was thinking about\ngoing into food trucks, things like that in Charleston Central. - Actually, can you pause on\nthat to take a tangent there? How does money laundering work? I mean, at that time and what years are we talking about chat? - This is by the time the tax\nreturn schemes go into play. We're talking 2002. 2003\nis when tax returns start. - And so what at that time and what you're aware\nof now, how it evolved, how does money laundering work? - You know, it's not that much\ndifferent. It's really not. You get a cash based business, start laundering the money\nor putting the money through that saying that transactions are legal. You then start depositing\ninto bank accounts from the bank accounts. My thing was is have bank accounts in the United States, Mexico, Canada, and then finally bounce over to Estonia was the final\ndestination of all this stuff. And the idea is to try to\nmove them to so many places that by the end of the day it looks legal and you can't trace it all if you're ever caught,\nwhich you ultimately are. But so cash based businesses- - So when you say, sorry to interrupt the\ncash based businesses. So you have money that needs to be moved to other people. So how does that work?\nWhat's the business? Are people providing you a service and you're giving them money? - Right, so you do the Ozark\nthing if you wanna do that. So you can gamble cash out\nsome like that over trips to whatever casinos you've got. You've got your production\ncompany or your detail company. So how many cars are you cleaning a day? How many companies have\nyou got to do that? Alright, whatever that company\nis. It's gotta be cash based. Somebody's paying you in\ncash, is what you're doing. You have to have enough of\nthose cash based businesses where it doesn't look funny. All right? Because if you're a detail company making a hundred thousand dollars\na month, that's a problem. (chuckles) - [Lex] Yeah. - Okay? So then you start\ndepositing into that. Well because of the Patriot Act as a suspicious activity report, SARS came in at $2,500 instead of\nthe 10K that it used to be. So all of a sudden you've\ngot multiple bank accounts that you've gotta set up. Alright? Fortunately what you also\nhad is you had a bunch of prepaid debit cards that were coming into play at the same time. So a combination of bank\naccounts, prepaid debits that had ACH abilities\nattach those as well. And you start running 'em all together. Then once it's outta the United States, you don't have to worry as much. You can start funneling that\ninto fewer bank accounts until finally you've\ngot the one main account that's over at Bank Latco and Estonia at that\npoint is what you've got. - [Lex] So a bunch of hops that end up at a place\nthat you can't trace. - And to give you an idea, I was arrested February 8th, 2005. My last seizure was 2010,\ngot the last seizure notice. So took him, they got it, (laughs) but it did took 'em,\nthat long to get to it. - So how do stories like with Script that come into play here\nwhere he had someone who owed him money,\nkidnapped and tortured. So when does it turn darker? - It turns darker when\nthe more money you make. Script was a kid that he\nwas stealing enough money that he was able to buy\nwhatever estate he wanted to. And he would brag about\ntouring the countryside. And if he saw property that\nhe liked, he would buy it. And that was not just a\nbrag, he was doing that. So this kid is stealing a lot of money. At the same time, he's got\nconnections politically 'cause of his family. He's got connections and that family's got connections\nwith the Ukrainian mob. Alright? So he's got these inroads and\npeople are looking out for him and he's stealing a lot\nof money at the same time. Somebody doesn't pay him\na decent amount of money. Somebody doesn't pay him. Now we had never, with\nShadowCrew, with CarderPlanet, with Counterfeit Library,\nwe were basically the geeks. Alright? We were just the fraudsters,\nthe social engineers. We had never really considered violence. The rules that I had in play were, Hey, we don't do child pornography, we don't do counterfeit\ncurrency, we don't do drugs. And the only thing we\nended up really obeying was the child porn stuff, except for Max Butler, who you mentioned earlier. Script, someone rips the guy off and he comes online on\nShadowCrew at that point and he posts these pictures one day. And I mean, it was a detailed narrative through the pictures. Had the guy that rammed in\nthe van, he had the door open, rammed in the van, had the guy tied up, had the guy being tortured. And the response was, this is what happens when you steal from me. And that's the first time that violence came into\nplay at that point. And that's when you start\nrealizing things are getting a little serious. - How did that make you feel? - The first response is, can't be real. He's just, that's he's just doing that. You know, he's just, he's\nwanting to send a message. Then you're like, no,\nthat's real. That's real. - Were you afraid in your own heart that you might descend to that too? Like if you see that, or was\nit pretty clear to you that that's a line that some people\ncan cross and some can't and you're not one of\nthose that can cross it? - You know, I gotta tell\nyou, I joke with my wife. The joke I tell my wife is, you know, if I knew some guy that\nhad 8,000 Bitcoins, I might be persuaded to\nask him for access to that. And she was like, how? And I was like, well, hammer and toes. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I say that as a joke, but there's that line where you're like, I remember who I used to be. And if you're looking\nat that kind of money, I might be persuaded to do that back then. And I think that's was\nScript's issue, is he, it was a lot of money to him. - Was the money. And then there's, you know,\nviolence can also be gradual. So over time you do a\nlittle more, a little more, a little more, a little more. - You get used to what's going on. And then like, get desensitized - And you figure, you take somebody like, like Ross Ulbricht, the\nSilk Road guy, alright? Ross was not a violent guy. He was not. But at that point in time, you know, he was sitting on 24 million in Bitcoin. He was the only game in town. And that 24 now is like, I don't know, 22, 24\nbillion, some crap like that. But he felt in danger. This guy was gonna turn him in it was a black mount him everything. So Ross thinks he hires a\ncouple hit men to kill the guy. So it becomes that thing. And I saw that over and over again. And I'd like to say I wasn't like that. But given the same circumstances, I would've probably done the same thing. - And also, it's not just about money. There's a lot of other forces,\nlike if you're threatened for your wellbeing or for your wealth or for your power, it's all\nunder different motivations. - Plus that online aspect\nfor those communities like that, if you're the\nhead guy, you really feel like you're the parent of these guys. So if somebody's starting\nto threaten them, it's like, alright, what do I need to do?"

      "section": "Dark web",
      "text": "- So what do you make of silk\nroast the ShadowCrew started something that today you can call darknet and darknet markets. So these markets that operate,\nthat trade things, everything from child pornography to drugs to, I mean, what else?\n- Everything. - What are the dark things\nthat humans want to do that they don't want anyone to know about? All of those things.\n- Right. - So, can you maybe\ntell me, you know what, let's just even step back. What is the darknet? How big is it? What happens there? - Let's backtrack a little bit more before we get to that.\n- Yes. - All right, what ShadowCrew\ndid, other than dealing in all these stolen wares,\nwhat ShadowCrew did, that's really important. Remember those three\nnecessities that I talked about. But the important thing\nis it established trust among criminals. Alright? Because that's a necessity. You have to be able to trust\nwho you're dealing with. 'Cause you have to deal with somebody. You have to, alright, so how do you know you're\nnot dealing with a cop? How do you know you're dealing\nwith somebody that's skilled? How do you know you're\ngonna deal with somebody that's not gonna rip you off? You gotta be able to\ntrust that individual. The ShadowCrew provided that\ntrust mechanism for criminals. You had that communication\nchannel, the forums where you could reference\nconversations, weeks, months, old, take part, learn\nfrom those conversations. You had vouching systems\nand review systems in place, escrow systems in place. You could knew by looking\nat someone's screen name if you could trust the individual network with the individual. Alright? And that community of just humans provided that backbone of trust. And that's really interesting\nwhen you think about it. You had the trust that was there, but you also had this, almost this instantaneous information\nthat was available about the community or about\ncyber crime at large. And that's still in play today. Alright? So when that was the way things were until a couple of things happened. And one was cryptocurrency,\nthe other one was the Tor browser, the dark web. Now I was working with the\nSecret Service, ripping the Secret Service off\nwhen Tor comes into play. Alright? So we got a memo in one day and it was talking about the Tor browser and it was like, we really\nneed to be careful with this. This is gonna be problem. And so we all fired up the Tor browser This was 2005, early '06. Turns out it was completely unusable. Could not use it at all simply\nbecause no one was using it. And it was extremely slow. - So people don't know,\nTor browser is a way to be completely anonymous. - As long as you properly know how to use it.\n- Right. - Huge caveat.\n- Yeah. - Alright. So developed by the United States Navy and they developed it.\n- Didn't know this. - Yeah, I did not, oh yeah. - It wasn't the hackers that?\n- U-huh. - Interesting. - US Navy. To this day, the number one funder of Tor, military to this day, all right? - Interesting. I mean the same, I\nguess with the internet. The origins are-\n- So it was developed so that operatives could communicate-\n- Interesting. - With each other\nwithout being identified. Alright. It then goes open source,\nthey release it, EFF comes in and starts sponsoring\neverything else like that. The next idea was, well,\nyou know, people can get around their country's firewalls, whistleblowers can use\nit, things like that. Well, someone forgot to\nmention that the first adoptees of tech, if you can\nuse it to launder money or remain anonymous, are criminals. And so criminals start to\nuse the damn thing. Alright? So along the same time we get, well a few years later we\nget Satoshi Nakamoto pops up with his ideas for Bitcoin, and then Ross Ulbricht runs with it. Ross Ulbricht decides he's\ngonna start up Silk Road. So initially the people\nwho were using Tor, which later is the dark\nweb people were using Tor, were just talking with each\nother, visiting websites, communicating like that. Someone figured out, Hey man, we could host\nwebsites on this thing. And they have a lot of\ntrouble finding the box. So that is the advent of\nSilk Road all of a sudden. Ross Ulbricht has this idea that he's gonna change the world by becoming the largest\ndrug dealer on the planet. So he opens up the Silk Road and the payment instrument\nhe allows is Bitcoin. So if those people out there\nare wondering why Bitcoin is going at what, 44K today?\n- Yeah. And by the time this is out, it could be 100,000 or 10,000. - [Brett] Absolutely. Absolutely. We'll see, who knows. (laughs) If it's 10,000, I'm gonna buy some buy. (both laughing) - Which is a hilarious statement to make because that statement\nwould be ridiculously wrong like five years ago. Right?\n- I know, I know, I know. - And people a hundred years\nfrom now would be laughing. Wait, it was that low. (both laughing) - So back then, so he\nonly accepts Bitcoin. And of course the initial use case of crypto is, no one\nwants to admit it today, but the initial use case is,\nwe're gonna buy a bunch of pot. (laughs) And we need somebody, we\nneed a way to pay for it. So that's what happens. Ross. It's really interesting to me. If you look at motivations\nof cyber criminals, the motivations are\nstatus, cash, ideology. Alright? My guys all cash across\nthe board, all cash. Ross' ideology, he really believed he was gonna change the world. He really didn't. I've been fortunate. I actually know the guy\nwho ran Silk Road two and have talked to the\nkid, everything else. And I will tell you that\nthose guys who are motivated by ideology, they are a\ncompletely different breed. They really are. It's not, you know, the cash\nguy, it's low hanging fruit. The ease of it's hard to\nstop committing crime. But it's much easier for a\ncash motivated individual to stop than it is that ideology guy, that Silk Road two guy, he's still got it. You know, he's not breaking the law, but you can see it's like\nhe wants to. (laughs) He wants to. - That's fascinating that I mean the worst atrocities\nin human history are committed with people that operate under ideology. All the other motivations in which weaker. - But you, you know, you think about it and you've got, with Ross, I mean, very bright guy, very bright guy. But think about the amount\nof cognitive dissonance that the guy's got, that he thinks he's gonna change the world by running a drug site. I mean, he certainly, I mean, could he have changed the world? Yeah. Could he have done it\nlike that? Probably not. - Well, I can steel man those arguments. I listen to quite a few libertarians, and you can push that to anarchists and, you know, there's a\nlot of people that argue. So I actually talked to\nfaculty, to a professor at Columbia who actually argues that all drugs should be legalized. And not at a philosophical\nlevel, political level, but the fact that all the\nnegative consequences of drugs that people talk about actually have to do with other factors in your life. - [Brett] I would agree with that. - And so that's a, okay, but that's more like a argument about\nnegative aspects of drugs. I think the ideology comes in where it's like, well, nobody should\ntell you what to do. You should have the responsibility of your own actions like the government or any other institution\nshouldn't be the rule setters the constraints for\nhow you live your life. And so that I could see\nthat argument being made. And ultimately, if you\nlike, create an open market for drugs, how that could\nbuild a better society. It might break down the\noutdated, the corrupt, the bureaucratic institutions. I mean, you can make that argument. - There's argument, there's an argument. And let's be fair, I\nwanna be fair with it. Yeah. I mean, could,\ndid he change the world? We do have this whole thing\ncalled cryptocurrency. - [Lex] Yeah. In the long\narc of history, perhaps. Yeah, we do have that. So that's a biggie. - And that might have\nbeen for it to take hold in society, maybe the darker\nparts of society at first. Maybe that was necessary. - Right? I mean, maybe I see how it pans out."

      "text": "ShadowCrew, we had this guy, Albert Gonzalez, this\nkid's name, we were growing so big that I had to\nstart farming things out. So the first thing I started farming, I instituted this review\nsystem, kind of establishing that trust mechanism even\nfurther for criminals to use. We needed somebody to take\ncare of our tech aspects of the forum. So associate of mine by the name of Kim Taylor, where we were looking for a forum techie, he\ncomes to me one night and he is like, \"Founder forum techie\". And I was like, \"Who's that?\" And he is like, \"It's this kid.\" And I was like, \"Is any good?\" He's like, \"Well, he knows the software.\" And I was like, \"Okay,\nwe just signed his on.\" He went by the screen name of CumbaJohnny was his screen name. And he starts selling credit cards after a while under a\nscreen name of Scarface. And that CVV one breach\nwhere you're cashing out the track twos at ATMs,\nyou know, $40,000 a day. So Albert's in New Jersey\none day, broad daylight and stands at an ATM for 40 minutes, just standing there\nfeeding in one ATM card after another point out cash,\ntaking the twenties out, stuffing 'em in that backpack. Meanwhile, just across\nthe street, a couple of cops just happened to be there. And they start noticing this\nkid's just standing there. So 40 minutes, they watch\nthis kid, 40 minutes. Finally one cop looks at the other, let me see what's going on there. (Lex chuckles) Walks over across the street,\nAlbert's wearing a wig, he's got the disguise on\neverything else like that. Ask him, \"Kid, what are you\ndoing?\" Albert falls apart. We didn't know Albert had been arrested. So Albert immediately\ngoes in, I wanna work for the Secret Service. At that point in time,\nSecret Service I referred to, and I wanna make sure I don't say it's not like that anymore. But back then they were\nfucking idiots, alright? They had no clue what was going on. - There was a competence issue that they were working\nthrough, is one way to put it. - That's a nice euphemism. So, (laughs) they were fucking idiots is another way to say it. - So they're just like not\naware of this digital world. - They had no clue, no clue. The way that Albert tells\nthem how to catch us because they looked at\nhim, how do we catch 'em? (both laughing) And Albert's like, Albert, I'm\nserious. Yeah, I'm serious. So Albert's like, \"Well,\nyou could try a VPN.\" \"What's a VPN?\"\n- Yeah. - So he explains it to 'em. They're like, \"That's a good idea.\" So I quit ShadowCrew. I was worried about all the news that was coming in and\neverything like that. I'm stealing 160K a week. I didn't know Albert had been arrested. I'm worried about being arrested. I know the writing's on the wall and I'm like, \"I'm quitting, I retire.\" - Where did you see the writing?\n- That were coming in? - Yeah. - The text messages about the\nSecret Service investigators referred to building to\nhow the pressures building. It's not gonna end well, man,\nthis is not gonna end well. This is going to be bad. So I announced my\nretirement of February 15th. I'm sorry, April 15th,\n2004 is my retirement. Yeah, I think that's 2004. And I quit. I walk away. Well,\nAlbert had been arrested. They cut him loose. No one\nknows he's been arrested. He comes back into ShadowCrew. I leave Kim Taylor at the same time, he's kind of on the run. Which, if you wanna know that story, that's a nightmare story in and of itself. So my second in charge,\nKim Taylor, this guy, there was this guy named David. Oh, what was his name? He was El Mariachi, was the\nguy's name David Thomas. (Brett laughs) David. Yeah, he was a film guy. - [Lex] Scarface. - Yeah, so El Mariachi,\nreal name David Thomas. He's on the run out of\nNebraska for check fraud. He comes to us on ShadowCrew\ntelling us this sad story. We take up a collection for\nthis guy, send it to him. Alright? I get him a job working with a low level carder\ntrying to make him some money. Alright? El Mariachi or Thomas\ndoes this for a few weeks. Comes to me one day and he's like, \"Man, I'm not making any money.\" I'm like, \"Okay, lemme see what I can do.\" Well, I had a Ukrainian guy by the name of Big Buyer,\nhe real friend of mine. And I contacted him I was like, \"Look man, I got a guy that wants to do some work. Can you help the guy out?\" And he's like, \"I got\nhim.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" So he sends Thomas enough money to go. Thomas is in Texas at that\npoint, sends Thomas enough money to go from Texas to Issaquah, Washington and rent an office space. Alright? So Thomas goes up there,\nrents his office space, him and his girlfriend rents an office space. And the plan is this Big Buyer is going to place an order, get product sent. Mariachi is gonna get the\nproduct listed on eBay. Cash out 50/50. Easy enough, alright? So Big Buyer places an order. First order is outpost.com, $18,000, the largest order\noutpost.com had ever received at that point in time.\n- Okay? - Order goes through.\n- Goes through still. - Goes through, he gets the product. All right, Mariachi comes\nback, tells my second in charge, Kim Taylor. Kim Taylor at this point,\nI'm 33, 34. Kim Taylor's 46. He works at the tattered cover bookstore in Denver, Colorado is where\nhe works at this point. And he fancies himself\nJason Bourne. Alright. He's even got one of the\nscreen names of Jason Bourne. So I'm like, \"All right.\" So Mariachi's telling us\nhow much money he's making, everything else. I'm like, \"Well, that's good.\nI'm glad you're all right.\" Kim contacts me like, \"I\nwant to go to Issaquah.\" And I was like, \"Why?\" And he's\nlike, \"To make some money.\" I'm like, \"You're making money.\" He's like, \"I wanna go to Issaquah.\" I was like, \"All right, go be careful.\" So he gets in the car. (laughs) Saturn is what he is driving. He drives his little piece of shit, Saturn all the way up to Issaquah,\ngets there, you know, midnight. They party all night long because they've never met each other. They're just celebrating\npartying, drinking, everything else like that. Meanwhile, Big Buyer has\nplaced another order, with outpost.com, $17,000, the second largest order outpost.com had ever received at that point in time. By this point in time,\noutpost knows the first order was fraudulent. Guess where it's going? The exact same address,\nthe first order goes. So Outpost picks up the\nphone calls is Issaquah PD, \"Hey, we got a fraudster.\" Issaquah is like, \"Would you\nmind sending some empty boxes?\" And Outpost is like, \"Be happy to.\" So the rule was, is on credit card fraud, if you've got full account\naccess, you place the order the morning that's supposed\nto arrive, you sign into the bank account or\nthe credit card account. If you can sign in, you\ngo pick up your product. If you can't sign in, you\ngo back to sleep that day. Alright, well, Big Buyer\nwas the guy who placed the order, Mariachi and my\nsecond in charge are partying. Alright? So they're supposed to\ncontact Big Buyer, they don't. Meanwhile, Big Buyer is\nraising hell, getting up with me like, \"Hey, where are you? Where are the guys? I can't find them. They don't need to pick up this product.\" So I can't get in touch with 'em. They go down to pick up the... So Mariachi's got a\nCadillac, old '70s Cadillac, he's got a Cadillac\npulls into the complex. Now Mariachi's driving, Kim\nTaylor's in the passenger seat. David Thomas's girlfriend's\nin the back seat as they pull into the complex\ngoing through the parking lot. Mariachi just happens to\nglance over and he sees a van with a guy sitting sideways\nin the van, and he looks at Kim Taylor and he is\nlike, that's an undercover. And Kim's like, \"Ah, it's fine.\" (laughs) So they pull up to the office complex. Kim's like, \"I'll go in\nand get the packages.\" So he walks in, looks at the guy behind the counter, I believe\nyou have some packages for us guy's, like one second. So (laughs) he disappear around the wall, out pops Issaquah PD, arrests Kim. David Thomas is in the car\nwatching all this happen. He bugs out and they arrest\nhim on the interstate where he has three fake\ndriver's licenses in his wallet, along with his real driver's license. Another no-no, but they get him. So David Thomas had outstanding\nwarrants out in Nebraska. We couldn't bond him out. Kim Taylor didn't have any\nwarrants, so we bonded him out. My third in charge kid,\nSeth Sanders was his name. He bonds him out, uses his girlfriend's\naccount to bond him out. And I get Marriott, not,\nI get Kim Taylor to go to Utah where he, another\nfriend of mine agrees to house him, him and his wife. So I think everything's fine and all that. About three weeks later,\nthis guy in Utah gets me on the phone, \"Hey,\nhe's gotta go.\" (laughs) I'm like, \"What's going on?\" He's like, \"Well, the\nonly thing he's doing is popping ecstasy tablets\nevery day, all day.\" And I'm like, \"Seriously?\"\nHe is like, \"Yeah.\" I was like, \"Okay, he's gotta go.\" So we kick him out of there. By this point, I've got another\ncrew that's coming through. I mean, I had all these crews\nrunning, had another crew that's coming through Denver,\nsend Kim back to Denver to partner up with these guys. Kim gets these guys arrested. So by this point in time, I'm exasperated, I just wanna throw my hands\nup in the air and walk away. So my retirement's coming\nup at the same time. So I'm like, \"Fuck it, I'm done.\" So I tell everybody,\nthe rest of the admins and the mods there, I'm like,\nthis is what's going on. You guys need to watch out for this. We need to ban Kim, not let him back in. Be careful what's going on.\" I walk away at the same\ntime I walk away, come to Johnny, Albert Gonzalez\ncomes back into play. He sees everything that's going on. He uses that to his advantage. He starts banning\neveryone that's suspicious of him sets up the VPN at the same time and says, Hey, to make\nsure we're all secure, I need all transactions\nto go through this VPN. VPNs ran by the Secret Service. Alright. Secret Service ends up, I\nthink they ended up cataloging like $7 million worth of\ntransactions over the next four or five months. ShadowCrew makes the front\ncover of Forbes August, 2004, headline, Who's Stealing Your identity? October 26th, 2004, United\nStates Secret Service arrest, 33 people, six countries, six hours. I was in Charleston, South\nCarolina when I saw it happen. And I'm like. (laughs) - You're the one that got away. - I'm the one public, there\nwere a couple other guys that got away that they\ndidn't publicly mention. One, his name was Tron. He was-\n- In the Zero. - Yeah, exactly. But he went\nby the screen named Tron. He had access, almost unfettered\naccess to Bank of America. So what happens is they\nidentified the guy, Secret Service is in\nthe air to go get him. They call the Ukrainian police, Hey, we're coming down to arrest this guy. Ukrainian cops are like, oh, come on down. So as soon as they got off the phone, Ukrainian cops get in the car, go down and tell Tron, \"Hey,\nthey're coming to get ya.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So (laughs) he bugs\nout, down to South America and they don't catch 'em. I think for six or seven years after that, something like that.\n- Caught him eventually. - But caught him eventually. - Well, let me actually ask\nyou on this point, you said"

      "timestamp": "2:11:55",
      "section": "Cybercrime",
      "text": "that, \"If you do cyber crime eventually, it's not gonna end well.\"\n- It does not end well. - Why is that? - So, I don't wanna say that's because you're gonna be arrested because honestly, very\nfew people are arrested. Alright? But it doesn't end well\nbecause of the type of person that you become. You quoted me earlier, \"You\nlie to everybody around you. You lie to yourself,\nyou lie to your friends, you lie to your family. Of course you lie to your victims. You don't have any friends.\" I went 20 years without friends. I had associates, I didn't have friends. - [Lex] And you can't truly trust- - You don't trust anybody. You don't trust anybody. I had my wife, I was\nmarried for nine years. I lied to her every single\nday of those nine years. And it took her nine years\nto give up on me to realize that I was that piece of shit. And she leaves at that point. Then from there I started dating\na stripper and lied to her. Lied to her, I thought I had friends. I lied to all those people that I knew that thought they were my friends. I lied to 'em. The entire time you\nbecome that individual. I don't think a lot of people really\nunderstand how bad that is. You know, you pointed out that woman that I ripped off, she\nwas trying to put a roof on her house for frigging kids, man. You're that person, you're that person. - You're also lying to yourself. And that's not a mindset in\nwhich you can grow as a person. Find happiness, find genuine,\nsimple human affection, which is what love is. - [Brett] Yeah. - Simple, real friendship. All of those things. - Right. So, you know, I\nwent to prison, of course. One of the things that, one\nof the most important lessons that I've learned in prison, because cyber crime, crime as a whole, if you're a criminal, it's\nan addiction, alright? If you're addicted to something,\nwhether it be drugs, crime, gambling, what have you, if\nyou're addicted to something, you cannot love anything\nelse except the addiction. The addiction comes first. Alright? And, you know, you pointed out some of those truly despicable things. Script for example, torches that guy. You get to the point where it's like, okay, this is the business. And you know, I tried to\nconvince myself that, you know, I'm a businessman, but I'm\na good guy on the other end. And you're not. You're not. So those lies become a\npart of everything else. And, yeah, you get the higher\nups are usually arrested. They are. But you know, you've got millions of cyber criminals these days. So most guys are not gonna be arrested. So you may be arrested, you may be like freaking Jonathan\nJames, he was a minor. A very, very talented\nindividual, very competent. As kid, he had broke\ninto NASA, DOD Pentagon. He shut the NASA computers\ndown for six weeks. This is the, that kid\nthen he decides he wants to go into credit card\ntheft partners with Albert. He's arrested with Albert. Law enforcement, they\nwere gonna blame him. He was the only competent individual. So this kid gets up one day,\nhe wasn't in prison yet. He gets up one day, goes\nin his dad's bedroom, gets out his 45, walks in the bathroom and blows his brains out. You've got things like that. Or you're gonna rip somebody\noff and you're gonna end up like Scripted with that guy. The guy who hit, who ran\nevolution marketplace, the one who, two people ran\nthat, the guy and a girl. And no one knew who they were. He ends up stealing\nabout $24 million, a lot of it from Ukrainian mob. And they found him about a year later on a beach without his head and hands. But, you know, it always goes south. But more than anything, to\nme, the negative thing is, is you really become\nsomebody that, I mean, just truly a despicable human being. When you get to the point when you steal, you're destroying people's\nretirement accounts. You're stealing money from\na woman that simply wants to do something good for her family. When you become that individual, and you're okay with that. My God, man, it got to the\npoint, I had one guy ripped off. It's like for $900 is when I first started the cyber crime stuff, it's\nwhen I was becoming competent. And I ripped him off for like $900. And he sent me an email and he was like, the email said something like, I guess you needed the money and it's okay, you know, you keep it. And I'm getting chills\nright now thinking about it. But it's that where you\nbecome that individual, yeah. - Can I actually backtrack?"

      "section": "Love",
      "text": "Listen, I love, love, okay.\n- I do too. - And there's a story that you fell in love with the stripper. I mean, you have to tell the story. So how did you fall in love with somebody? Not that there's anything\nwrong with that profession, but it's romantic. It's like that true romance,\nby the way. Great movie. - It is a great film.\nIt's truly a great film. - Even Brad Pitt who makes a\nbrief appearance is genius. There's so much good acting there. Anyway, so tell me that love story. - Like I said, I get from my dad, I get that fear of being abandoned. You know, I lied to my wife for\nnine years until she leaves. And I was in Charleston, South Carolina. And what happened was, I noticed that Susan, she was not coming\nto bed like she used to. And she'd stay up all night\nlong and sometimes she'd go and be gone a few hours\nor, and everything else. And I'm like, well, something's going on. And I'd pass by her, her computer and she would minimize the screens. And I'm like, \"Well, gotta figure out\nwhat the hell's going on.\" So put a key logger on her system- - As anybody should in a relationship. - Absolutely. 'Cause you trust them. (laughs) You know, so why not? - You should be tracking\nall their movements, all their-\n- Exactly, exactly. Like I said, I was the control freak too.\n- It's romantic. - So I found out she\nhad been cheating on me and she was-\n- See? There you go. You had a reason.\n- Had reason I justified. So I found out she was cheating on me. She was asleep when I found it out. And I sat there looking at,\nand I was like, well shit. So got up, walked in the\nbedroom, opened up the wardrobe, got a suitcase out, started\nputting her clothes in it. Then she wakes up, she's\nlike, \"Where are you going?\" I'm like, \"I'm not, you are.\" Well my bravado\ndisappeared pretty quickly. I took about a week of both of us crying and arguing and everything\nelse and she finally left. And I went through this depression. I was in Charleston, South Carolina. I would just walk around\nthe house, kind of stumbling in a daze, realized I was getting suicidal and was smart enough to\ndo something about it. And picked up the phone book. And that's where there's\nalways this sense of humor. So I picked up the phone book, I'm going through the yellow pages. I'm like, psychologist,\ncriminal psychologist, ' cause I need that. (both laughing) And called this psychologist crying to her, I mean, crying on the phone. Told her everything, I'm this criminal, this is what's happened. She's like, \"Come in now.\" I was like, go in, spill my guts. And saw her for about four months. And I joke about, well it's true. She was trying to get me\nto stop breaking the law and to go into real estate. And I remember telling her,\n\"Is there a difference?\" (laughs) She was like, \"Yes, there's a difference.\" So saw her for about\nfour months. I was 34. I didn't start drinking until I was 34. Had never done drugs,\nanything else like that. 'Cause my mom was an addict\nas well. So I was this guy. I always wanted to be in control. Didn't wanna, you know,\nlose control of myself and had never been to the strip club. So one night I was getting lonely. So I walked into the strip club, actually I was researched this strip club and it was Joe's Roundup in Charleston, South Carolina.\n- Joe's Roundup. - Joe's Roundup, little\nbitty hole in the wall stuff. I was, yeah, real classy. So I walked in and I'm literally\nthat guy, man that fell in love with the first, the\nfirst stripper that he sees. She walks by, I'm like, \"That one.\" So I didn't know, I didn't\nknow the strip club game. I'm again, criminal naive as hell. So belly up at the bar, order the beer. I'm sitting there drinking it. She comes over to me and\nwe start chatting, talking. And she's like, would you like\nto get a bottle of champagne? I was like, does does that\nmean going in back or what? And she's like, \"Well yeah, you need to do\nthe bottle of going back.\" And I was like, \"Sure, let's\nbuy a bottle of champagne. $400 bottle of Korbel.\"\n- Wow. - So (laughs) I'm like, \"Alright.\" And again, that bravado\ndisappears pretty quickly. I get back there and\nwe talk for two hours. And you know, nowadays I don't understand that most men who go to\nstrip clubs, the strippers are their therapist most of the time. Alright. So I'm sitting there\ntalking, we're talking and of course she's sizing me up. She's looking at the watch, she's like, \"What kind of car\nyou drive?\" (laughs) You know, everything else. And\nI'm like telling her talking. And so at the end of the night I'm like, \"Really nice meeting.\" She's like, \"It's so nice\nmeeting you too.\" So I leave. - So you guys just talked-\n- Just talked. - And there's still no dancing, this feeling of love and all that. - Yeah, so just talked,\ngot along pretty good. I'm like, \"I like her, I like her.\" So come back in a week later,\nwalk in and call her over. And I was like, \"Look.\" I said, \"I'm not.\" I said, \"that was my first\ntime to a strip club.\" I said, \"don't know you. I like you, I'd like you to know you more. Would you like to go out to dinner?\" And she was like, \"Yeah.\" I was like, \"Where would you like to go?\" So she says, \"Rudi John.\" And I was like, \"Don't know what it is,\nthat's where we'll go.\" So I go back and I was,\nI had a theater buddy at that point in time 'cause I was trying to\nget my life together. JC was his name. And I\nwas like, \"I got a date.\" And he's like, \"You got a date?\" I was like, \"Yeah man, I got a date.\" And he's like, \"Okay,\nwhere are you going?\" And I was like, \"Ru Dejan.\" And he is like, \"Take\nyour wallet.\" (laughs) I'm like, \"Yeah.\" And he's\nlike, \"Take your wallet.\" I was like, \"Alright.\" So we start, you know, doing\nthe lunch and the dinner thing. And I get to where I really like her. I was 34, she was 23 and\ngot along really well. Listened, you know, had common\ninterest in music and arts and stuff like that. She had, I mean, a stereotypical, she had graduated college with a degree in religious studies.\n- Wow. - Yeah. So I was like, all right. - So yeah you just fell in love. - Yeah, we got along\nreally well. Really well. So I ended up moving her in with me. She hadn't quit her job. And what was happening was\nshe was working weekends and you know, the club\nwould close at 3:00 or 4:00. She wouldn't come home until\n10:00 or 11:00 in the morning. And most of the time it\nwould be a phone call saying come and pick me\nup, I can't drive home. And then I'd never used\ndrugs, had never been around and my mom Valium and\npot and things like that. But as far as interacting with her, I'd never done anything like that. By this point in time, I'm kind of getting head over heels with her. I've moved in with me and everything and I had never, I was\n34, I had never went through a woman's purse my entire life. And so she comes in, passes out and I'm like, \"I gotta\nknow what the going on.\" And went over and went through\nher purse, found cocaine and you know, the straw cut\noff straws and all that stuff. And I'm like, broke my heart. I just sat there and started crying. Got online and I'm the guy\nthat can find information. So I started looking for forums on strip clubs, found a forum. I found that one found\nwhere it was talking about her prostituting\nherself to support the habit. And that got me, man. That got me, I was talking\nabout everything she was doing to do that. - [Lex] And that broke your heart there. Oh man. Yeah. So went and I didn't have\nthe heart to tell her that I knew she was\nprostitute, but I went to her and I was like, she's waking up. And I was like, \"Look, I\nfound this in your purse. I can't have that.\" And she's like, \"Well, you\nthink I'm prostituting?\" I was like, \"No, no, I don't think that.\" I knew it, but I didn't mention it to her. And I was like, \"I can't have that.\" \"Well I don't do that. It's\njust a one time thing.\" I was like, \"All right.\" So she went back to work and continued to do it\nfor a couple more weeks. And then finally I was like, \"I can't.\" So I picked her up one morning as like she was couldn't drive home before I picked her up\nI had written her note, left it on the pillow. So I brought her home,\ntucked her in the bed and told her I'd be back that night. Told her she had a\nletter when she woke up. I woke up and the letter was\nbasically, you know, I love you if you can't stop this, don't\nbe here when I get back. And I went to Columbia that day, came back that night and she had quit her job and she quit drugs that\nnight, really quit 'em. And I got it in my head that I needed to do whatever I needed to do to make sure she didn't go back to that. That became that to me\nbecause of my background. That meant spending a lot of money. And so every night was, you\nknow, three to $600 for dinner. It was a thousand\ndollars shoes every week. $2,000 purse every week. All that. I had most of my money\nlaundered out to Estonia. And Elizabeth at the same time she quit, but she didn't want me to go anywhere. Alright, all right. She\nwanted me there all the time. I guess that was that connection. You know, she, I guess she was scared she might go back to something. So ShadowCrew gets\nbusted and I start, I go through basically all my\nUS funds can't get anything from overseas. ShadowCrew gets busted October. I can't go into committing tax fraud because season's over, can't go back into credit fraud because\nShadowCrew's been busted. I don't know who to trust online. I'm left with running\ncounterfeit cashier's checks to get money in trying to make it until, you know, I can start\nback with some other fraud and lying to her the entire time. - She knows about none of this? - None of none of it. She thinks I've got a shit load of money and she's got expensive taste. And at the same time she\ncouldn't be intimate. I mean the girl loved me, that's the first time\nI've really said that. - [Lex] So there's deep\nlove there both ways? - Yeah. Yeah. - [Lex] The things we do. - She couldn't be intimate\nunless she was stone cold drunk. I mean, just stone cold drunk. And I didn't mind her drinking alcohol. I'd rather have that than cocaine. So that was the intimacy there. And I kept thinking if I continue to invest that it would work out. You know, that just keep\ngoing. She'll be all right. We'll be all right. And what happens is like I\nsaid, she thought I had money. She thought I had money. She wanted a couple of\nTiffany engagement rings. So I said, \"We can get married.\" I figured if marriage show her that I love her, show her\nit's gonna be all right. So I was like, \"Oh, let's get married.\" She's like, \"Well I've always\nwanted a Tiffany ring.\" I didn't have money to\nbuy the Tiffany ring 'cause all my money was overseas. So here, I've defrauded. So\nit's counterfeit cashier's. I find like a three karat\nring on eBay for 20 grand and pay for it with a\ncounterfeit cashier's check. At the same time because\nshe doesn't want me to leave, she needs me there. Typically, if you're doing\nthat type of crime, you need to be traveling. You can't do it in one central area because you're gonna be\nidentified pretty quickly. I knew that, but I\ndidn't have much choice. So start running\ncounterfeit cashier's checks to get the money to live and everything. Get the engagement ring. We were scheduled to be married. Our wedding date was February 26th, 2005. February 8th, 2005. I've got a Tiffany wedding band, a couple of 'em coming in and I get arrested in Charleston, South Carolina. And she didn't know. I told her, I said, \"I've\ngotta go pick up those rings.\" She didn't, she thought I\nwas just having 'em sent in, said \"I gotta go get those rings.\" And I said, \"we'll go out\nto dinner after that.\" And I left at like eight\no'clock in the morning and I was arrested at I think\n11:30, something like that. Of course I wanted to call her, you know, and the FBI got me, it turns\nout it was controlled delivery. There were like 30 agents\nin the parking lot. FBI got me and Charleston PD got me. Within 45 minutes the\nSecret Service comes in, takes over that investigation. They knew exactly who they had. About seven o'clock at night, they're like, \"We wanna search your house.\" And I was, \"Look, I'll\nsign off on the search if you let me go with\nyou so I can see her.\" And they were like, \"Okay.\" So I gotta see my phone at\nthat point had like 140 calls that she, where she had been\ntrying to call that time. - She was worried.\n- Yeah. - And so they load me up and held, I mean you talk\nabout 10, 12 cars, you know, 40 agents, everything else. She's got a dog at that point. I'm scared they're gonna shoot the dog. And it was dark. And they had me walk up\nand they're all behind me and I knock on the door and\ntell her the police are there and she needs to put the dog up. So she does. And they come in and just\nstart ransacking them to put me in cuffs, set me\ndown, start berating her with questions. She had no idea what\nthe hell was going on. - Were you able to say a word\nor two to help her understand? - Yeah, I was trying to tell her. And at the same time they\ntake a watch off her wrist. They let her keep the ring. They're telling her that I'm\nthis guy, what's my real name? Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang\nacross across the board. - [Lex] So she's probably terrified. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I tell her, I was like, \"Look, they're gonna arraign me tomorrow. Don't come, don't come.\" I said, \"see what's going\non, but don't show up.\" Of course she's there\nthe next morning, her and her dad, and she's\nback in the back crying. They're reading off the charges. I'm under $300,000 bond, everything else. And that's it, they throw me in a cell. Meanwhile, more charges\nkeep coming in, you know, and it's like 10, 12\ncharges a day at that point. And I'm trying to call her\nto make sure she's all right. - [Lex] Does it get through? - So I spent three\nmonths in jail and during that three months she visits twice. I get like three or\nfour phone calls to her. Looking back now I\nunderstand why, you know, back then it was like,\nI'm the victim, you know, why doesn't she talk to me? But now I understand why\nhell the girl loved me too. And then she found out I\nwas this piece of shit. And after a week in county\njail, two agents fly in from New Jersey. Two Secret Service guys\npulled me out of cell, looked at me and they were like,\n\"We got your laptop.\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" And he's like, \"Well, have you\ngot anything on your laptop?\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"You're gonna\nbe charged for it.\" I was like, \"I figured.\" And then he looks at me, he is like, \"Can you do anything for us?\" And I told him my exact words were, \"Look, you let me get back with Elizabeth. I'll do whatever you want me to do.\" And he looks at me, he is like,\n\"We're gonna get you out.\" I was like, \"Alright.\" So they let me sit there for three months (laughs)\nto get a taste of it. And get me out. My sister, they have the bond\nreduced to a thousand dollars. My sister pays the thousand dollars bond. By this point, she's disown me. And because I'm dating the stripper. And Denise bonds me out. The person that I call\nimmediately is Elizabeth, I'm out. And she's like, \"I'll be there.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" So that's\nlike 11 o'clock at night. I'm in the parking lot of the Charleston Police,\nCharleston County jail, me and a Secret Service agent standing there. And Elizabeth had a friend\nthat owned a limo company. So she pulls up in a limo, gets out, pops the trunk, gets these\ntwo plastic containers out that have my clothes in them,\ndrops all the pavement, comes over, hugs me, call me later,\ngets in the car, drives off. I'm sitting there crying like a baby. Agent looks at me, \"Is that\nyour fiance?\" I'm like, \"Yeah.\" And he is like, \"I am so sorry.\" (laughs) And I'm like, \"Yeah.\" (laughs) - She sounds fascinating.\n- Yeah, yeah. - Pull up in a limo. (both laughing) - I had $30 to my name at that point. $30. The agent had to pay for my\nhotel room that first night. So he drops me off after paying for the hotel room, buy\nme something to eat. Soon as he drops me off, I\ntake that $30, walk a half mile to Walmart, buy a prepaid debit card so I can start back in tax fraud. Soon as I get back to the\nhotel room, call Elizabeth, beg her to come see me. She comes to see me and\nwe talk most of the night and convince her to give me a chance. I tell her that \"Hey,\neverything's gonna be all right. They're gonna hire me. I'm\ngonna be this big consultant.\" Lies lies. Just so she get back with\nme and she's like, \"Okay.\" And so we moved from\nCharleston, the field office is in Columbia, South Carolina. And I'm breaking the law even before I start working with 'em. I'm breaking the law. And so they've got me in the\noffice, the field office. They got this big wall room in there. I'm on a laptop, outside\nline, laptops hooked up to a 50 inch plasma monitor on the wall. They've got a desktop\nsitting directly next to me, outside line. Two Secret Service officers in the room at all times with a South\nCarolina law enforcement officer. My job is four to six hours\na day surfing the web, picking up targets, intel, teaching them how cyber crime operates,\neverything else like that. For the first two weeks,\nthey are extremely diligent. They pay attention to\neverything that's going on. Ask questions, everything else. But the problem is, is that\nthat gets boring real quick because I'm very fast online doing that. So they're like, \"What\nthe hell is he doing?\" And it gets tiring looking at\na guy just doing that shit. So after two weeks they get lazy and bored and they start watching\nporn instead of watching me. At the same time, they've got a key logger and they've got Spectra Pro and Camtasia. Key loggers and taking\nsnapshots of everything that I'm doing. It go every night. It goes\non a DVD rom on a spindle. So I'm like, they're not\ngonna go through that shit. So I'm like, \"Fuck it.\" Start breaking law from inside\nthe Secret Service offices while they're in the room. Why not? That continues for 10 months. At the same time, the relationship with Elizabeth fell apart,\ncompletely fell apart. - As it would. Do you have an understanding\nof why it is just because of her heart got\nbroken 'cause there was lying? - [Brett] It was the trust. - She felt like she did a lot.\n- Yeah. - To sacrifice for the\nrelationship you've got. - You got a woman there\nthat she had even said it. She had told one of her friends,\nwe were out having dinner one night, and this was\nbefore I got arrested. She told one of her friends\nthat I was the only guy that ever asked her to stop using drugs. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I have to say that, that part of the story is so powerful. And then that she chose to\ndo it and she chose to stop. - And she told me that\nthere was one instance, she told me that if she didn't marry me, she'd never be married. And as far as I know,\nshe's never been married. - [Lex] And so it started to fall apart there?\n- Yeah. Because I was that piece of shit. - Still, you didn't take a step. By the way, can I just\nsay how just moving it is, how honest you are, but thank you. Thank you for being that person. But at that time you,\nthere's still that lying. - Oh man yeah, yeah, yeah.\nSo it's fallen apart. She wants to start going to strip clubs and I'm like, fuck it,\nwhy not let her, we'll go. So we start gonna strip clubs and she'll come back and be, get wasted and we'll have sex, what have you. And one night she looks\nat me and she was like, she was like, \"I think it'd\nbe funny if you got a blow job from somebody else.\" And that got me, that got me. I was like, to me that was\nthe final straw right there. I was like, she doesn't\ncare for me anymore or anything else like that. We'd been gonna strip clubs. So I started dating another stripper and she knew something was going on and she looks at me one day and she's like, why don't you just\ntell me that it's over? And I looked at her and I\nsaid, it's over. We're done. And I told her, I was like, \"Look.\" I said, \"whatever you want.\"\nWe were renting an apartment. I was like, whatever you\nwant in here, take it. I said, not only that, but\nI'll make sure you got money for several months, so you're all right. And I was like, \"Just leave\nme, you know, leave my TV and leave, leave me some\nplates and stuff. (laughs) So I go to work that day at\nthe Secret Service, come back that night and she's taking\neverything and left a picture of herself in the bedroom on the floor. I'm like, \"Okay, I guess I deserve that.\" - I like her. She's got- - She's cool. She was cool. (laughs) So I'm giving her a thousand dollars like every two weeks for some like this. And it gets to the point, 'cause I'm doing this tax\nfraud from inside the offices. Well, the debit card companies\nare pinging the cards. They start to realize that, hey, some son of a bitch is stealing\nmoney using our debit card. So they start to shut down the cards before I can pull cash out. So I start not to have\nthe money to send to her. And I'm like, so she calls and she's like, look,\nI have to have money. And I was like, \"Well look,\nI'm doing what I can.\" \"You promised money.\" And I was like, \"Look, if\nyou knew what I was doing to get this money, you\nwouldn't be asking that.\" And she was like, \"I need money. My rent's behind a month right now.\" And I'm like, \"Your rent's\nbehind?\" She's like, \"Yeah.\" So I was like, \"Okay.\" So I pick up the phone,\ncall the rental office and I was like, just wanna\nmake sure that you know, I'm sorry I'm behind on the\nrent for this apartment number. Oh no, that rent's paid up three months. It's like, \"Okay, hang\nup. Call Elizabeth back.\" I was like, \"You're behind on the rent.\" And she was like, \"Yeah.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Funny.\" They just said, \"You're\nup on it three months.\" And she gets quiet and she's like, \"Well, you lied to me too.\" And I was like, \"You're right.\" (laughs) \"I did, I did that.\"\n- Yeah. - And I was like, \"but look,\nI can't do it anymore.\" And that's the last time I\nspoke to her right there. What happens is I was breaking\nlaw from inside the offices. I had a buddy that, his name was Sean Mims outta Los Angeles. I had taught him how\nto do tax return fraud. I had told Sean I go missing, right? I go missing for three months. I told him if I ever went\nmissing not to contact me. And so I go missing. Then\nI show back up online. First day he contacts. So he becomes a target and they\nidentify him pretty quickly. At that point he's set\nto be arrested sometime in March of six, that's when\nhe's set to be arrested. Operation Rolling Stone was\nthe name of the operation. Nine people were supposed\nto be arrested that night. So Secret Service goes and\ngoes and arrests this guy. They search his apartment\nand don't find anything. The apartment manager\ncomes out and explains to him how Sean has done all\nkinds of work to the apartment. As a matter of fact, he\nbrought in $30,000 worth of Italian tile to put in the\napartment that he is renting. And by the way, last night\nhe had a U-Haul out here and took out a whole shit\nload of stuff. (laughs) So the Secret Service comes\nback in, they look at me and they're like, \"We need\nyou to take a polygraph.\" And my answer was, \"I\nain't taking a polygraph.\" So they're like, \"Well, we'll throw you\nback in jail if you don't.\" And I was like, \"Call my lawyer. Lawyer\ngets me on the phone.\" He is like, \"You don't have\nto take the polygraph.\" I was like, \"Well good. I'm not going to.\" He's like, \"But they will\nthrow you back in jail.\" And I was like, \"Don't wanna do that.\" And he's like, \"Have you done anything?\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" And he's like, \"Well, you can\ntry to pass the polygraph.\" (laughs) I'm like, \"Okay.\" So I looked at, I was like,\n\"let's take the polygraph.\" They asked three questions. The questions were, have\nyou talked to anybody? Have you been on computer\noutside of the offices? Have you talked to the press? Which I was interviewing with a New York Times\nwriter the entire time. And then have you contacted or warned anybody about investigations? And I failed polygraph completely. So they revoked the\nbond, took me back down to Charleston County, throw me into jail. Three days later, Secret\nService shows back up and pulled me out of a cell. It's Jim Ramone and Bobby Kirby. And they were, I mean,\nhonestly, they were good men and they gave me chances upon\nchances to do the right thing. And I was not ready to do that. And Jim Ramone and Bobby's in there and Bobby, I mean Bobby was a friend. Yeah. I mean he truly was. Later on, a couple years\nago, I had a chance to... A couple years ago, I had\na chance to have lunch with a man and told him I was sorry for everything I did to him. 'cause I got him and him,\nhim and another agent fired and told him I was\nsorry for what happened. And he told me then he is\nlike, we were your friends man. We were truly your\nfriends. So they were good. - They wanted to help.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] They wanted you to be a good man. - Yeah. Yeah. What got me so bad is I told him, I was like, man, I'm trying to be a better guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - And he's like, Brett,\nyou always were a good guy. You just didn't know it. - People like that.\n- Yeah. - We need people like that in this world. - Yeah. - You need somebody to basically believe-\n- Oh man. - That you can be a good man. - So Jim Ramone pulls me out. He's the second in\ncharge in South Carolina. He's got the Miranda Waiver\n(laughs) in front of him. Right? And he looks at me, he is\nlike, I'm playing hard. Bobby's over here looking distraught and you know, like a hurt dog. And Jim's like, here's the\nway this is gonna work. He said, \"You're going to tell me everything you've done the past six years, or I'm gonna make it my mission in life to over you and your family.\" And he said, \"not just this case, once\nyou get outta prison, I'll hound you the rest of your life.\" Then he slides the Miranda waiver over and he is like, \"Now you want to talk.\" And I looked at him and I\nwas like, \"Nope.\" (laughs) He was like, he gets up, gets all red in the face, storms out as on the way out. He is like, \"Fuck you very much.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So I go back to the cell. A week later I was on\nonly under state charges. A week later, Judge rules, they revoke the bond improperly.\n- Wow. - Oh, reinstates the bond. Nobody calls the Secret Service to tell 'em I walk out. I walk out, I was dating the stripper and I told my mom, I was like, \"Well, if they're gonna fuck\nme, they're going to have to find me. (laughs) - Just went on the move. - Yeah, I called this stripper girl up. I'd given her like 60K,\nsome shit like that. And I told her, I was like,\n\"Kim, I need some money.\" And she was like, \"What?\" And I was like, \"Look.\" I said, \"gimme a thousand dollars. I'll give you back $3,000 in two weeks.\" She was like, \"Okay.\" So I met her in Augusta, Georgia and got the thousand from her and started driving west on I-20. No idea where to go to\nanything else. Got to Dallas. There was a prepaid debit\ncard supplier in Dallas. Went in, walked in the\noffice, convinced the guy, social engineering, convinced the guy to gave me 60 prepaid debit cards, without a driver's\nlicense, without payment. Anything else he did.\nAnd that started the run. I ended up stealing from that\nI stole like 160K profit. Used that to buy a Jeep\nCherokee and went on. The idea was to steal enough\nmoney to bug out to Flo Anolis, Brazil, and set up shop\ndown there (laughs) and do it again. - [Lex] That was the dream. - That was it. That was it. So I was on the run for\nfour months, stole $600,000. I was in Las Vegas, Nevadane. The night before. I'd\nstolen 160K out of ATMs. Went in, the next morning\nI woke up, signed on"

      "timestamp": "2:49:06",
      "section": "Prison",
      "text": "to cardersmarket.com, which was ran by Max Butler, the Iceman. And there's my name US Most Wanted on it. And that gets your attention. It was my real name with the\nUS Most wanted beside of it. Nobody knew my real name\nin that environment at all. But then they did and it was\ntalking about me being part of the Secret Service\nOperation, AnglerPhish, everything else. So of course they're all like- - [Lex] So everybody's after you. - Oh yeah, we're gonna\nget this son of a bitch. So I sat there looking at it and I was like, said it out loud. I was like, \"Well, Mr. Johnson, you've made the United\nStates most Wanted list. What do you do now?\" And I was like, \"I'm going\nto Disney World.\" (laughs) - [Lex] Literally. - Literally, literally said that out loud. So loaded up the Jeep. Drove from Las Vegas to Orlando, Florida and got the two annual passes. One to Disney World, the other\none to Universal Studios. Paid, paid for a timeshare. They were building these new timeshares right off Universal Drive. Building these brand new timeshares, paid for a timeshare nine months, cash. I was like, we take\ncash. Yeah, we take cash. There's $12,900. Then it wasn't furnished. So I went down to a furniture store, bought $30,000 in furniture. They had seized a DVD collection\nof mine worth 30 grand. Bought that back and proceeded to go to\nDisney World every day. And that lasted about six weeks. They used a Trigger Fish\nis what they use nowadays. It's called a Stingray to find me. So one day I was, it was like 10:30 in\nthe morning on Saturday. September 16th was the day 2006. So 2006, September 16th, I was used to the builders coming around, knocking, making sure everything was all right. So I was asleep, heard\nthis, knock at the door and get up, look through the keyhole. Nobody's there. You know the\npee hole, nobody's there. I was like, huh. Open the door. Step out into the hallway,\nwalking down the hall. It was Bobby Kirby,\nanother South Carolina guy and a Orlando Orange County cop. And they turn around,\nthey're like, \"Hey Brett.\" I'm like, \"Hey Bobby, how are you?\" And he's like, \"We're good. How are you?\" And I'm like, \"I'm fine. Would you like to come in?\" And he was like, \"Let's\nput you in cuffs first.\" And I was like, \"That's\nprobably a good idea.\" So he was like, He walks in. - I like those guys. - He was like, \"Have you\ngot anything in here?\" And I was like, \"Yeah, there's\n$120,000 in the bedroom.\" And he was like, \"seriously?\" I was like, \"Yeah, that and\nan AK47.\" His face goes white. And he's like, \"You've got a rifle.\" And I was like, \"No, I'm\nkidding with you.\" (laughs) And he was like, he was like, \"Okay.\" So they throw me in jail in Orange County and they gave me diesel therapy. And diesel therapy is,\nit took like two weeks to transport me from\nOrange County, Orlando to Columbia, South Carolina. And what happens is, is you\nstop at every county jail, you possibly can go\nthrough the processing, which is about six hours. Once you get to your bunk,\nhey, time to transport you. (laughs) - [Lex] They do that on purpose. - On purpose. On purpose.\n- Yes. - Wears you down mentally and\nphysically and everything. I get to Columbia, South Carolina now while\nI was at Orange County, what happens is this inmate, because we were in federal holding. This inmate, he looks at\nme, his name was Yeti. And he is like, \"Hey man, you know, the only time you get\noff in federal prison is the drug program.\" And I was like, \"Well\nman, I don't use drugs.\" And he is like, \"You can find\na drug problem, can't you?\" And I was like, \"I can\nfind a drug problem.\" So what happens is, is\nevery county jail I stop at, on the way to Columbia, I tell him I'm alcoholic and cocaine. So by the time I get to\nColumbia, South Carolina, they've got this paper trail of Mr. Johnson requesting help for drugs. I had hired Strom Thurman's\nson as an attorney. They make me drop him because I paid for him with illegal funds. So they give me a public defender, he gets a psychological\nevaluation ordered for me. So psychologist comes into\ncounty jail, four hour interview. About halfway through, he\nlooks at me, he is like, \"You using any type of drugs?\" And I was like, yeah. He's\nlike, \"What do you use?\" \"Cocaine?\" \"Smoker, snort.\" \"Snort.\" \"How much?\" \"An eight ball a day.\" \"That's a lot.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Do you have any trouble\noutta that?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I can't get an erection.\" And he looks at me and\nI'm looking at him like, 'cause I had gotten that\nshit from Boogie Knights. (laughs) Yeah. So I'm like, \"And finally.\"\nI'm like, \"is that right?\" And he was like, \"It could\nhappen.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" So that makes it into\nmy pre-sentence report. So all federal inmates, probation office and prosecutor, they do this\ndetailed background check to basically tell the judge\nhow much time to give you. All right, so that drug bit with that interview makes it into the PSR. So they have interview,\nI mean day of sentencing. I had pled guilty day of sentencing. The prosecutor, he stands up and this, this dude is\nscreaming at this point. And he's like, \"Mr. Johnson's manipulated\nthe secret surface. He's manipulated the prosecutor.\" Then he points at the judge, \"and he's manipulating\nyou today, your Honor, we insist on the upper\nlimits of the guidelines.\" Well, I had been telling\neverybody in the jail that if they give me any more than 60 months, I am not staying. (laughs) So they're like, \"Okay, sure.\" So the judge looks at me\nand she's like, \"I agree.\" I'm like, and she says, \"75 months.\" So I looked at my lawyer and I was like, \"Can you get the drug program for me?\" He's like, \"I don't know how I'll ask.\" So he stands up, \"Your Honor, will you\norder the drug program for Mr. Johnson.\" The judge says, \"No, but I'll\nrecommend he gets evaluated.\" So the Secret Service had told her, \"Hey, he's full of shit.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So she's like, \"No, but I'll recommend he gets evaluated.\" I looked at my lawyer and I was like, \"What does that mean?\" He was like, \"You're\nprobably not gonna get it.\" And I was like, \"How soon\ncan you get me to the camp?\" And he was like, \"Well,\nif you don't appeal, I can get you there pretty quick.\" My exact words were, \"Fuck the\nappeal, get me to the camp. I'll take it from there.\" He looks at me like, I'm the\nbiggest idiot in the world. I get sent to 'cause you\ncan get a camp recommended. I have friends, family\nmembers look for camps that don't have a fence around them. And we settle on Ashland, Kentucky. Six weeks later I'm at Ashland, Kentucky and pull up there, 14 foot\nfence, raise a wire on top. And I'm like, I don't climb\nfences. So like go in. First question I ask\nis, are there any jobs outside of the fence? And he was like, guard's like, \"Well you can work in\nthe national forest.\" And I'm like, \"No, I'll die out there.\" And he was like, \"Well\nyou could do landscaping.\" I'm like, \"I could run\na weed eater.\" (laughs) So two days later I walk\ninto the landscaping office and the cop, this is this genius of some of these people and institutions,\nthe cop behind his desk, the entire wall is a blown\nup photo of the compound and the outlying area. So I can literally sit there\nand plot where I'm going. Alright. My dad, I hadn't spoken\nto that man in years. And he shows up at my sentencing and stands up in front of the judge. And he is like, \"Your Honor, I wanna make\nsure Brett gets a good start. He can live with me when he\ngets out. Everything else.\" Looking back, the man meant that. And I just thought it\nwas bullshit at the time. So he starts to visit me in\nprison. I mean, yeah, in prison. He starts to visit and about\nthe third visit in, he looks at me, he is like, \"I've been reading about you online.\" I was like, \"Yeah.\" He is like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"That's a\nlot of money you made.\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"You think you can teach\nsomebody how to do that?\" (laughs) And I'm like, so what I used to say, and it again that it's this\nthing of, really coming to terms with things. What I used to say was, is\nI thought my dad was back in my life and that he\nwas just trying to use me. Alright. The truth of the matter is that my dad hadn't\nreally seen me except in that frame of crime, you\nknow, being that criminal with my mom, everything else. And I really think that's\nhow the man was trying to communicate with me. - He wanted to connect with you\nin the places where you love or you're interested in. - [Brett] Right. - Where your addiction is essentially. - Right, and what I did\nis I manipulated the man into helping me escape. So I agreed to teach\nhim how to do tax fraud. And in return, he had\nthe only money he had to his name, he had $4,000 cash. So I manipulated him and he given me that. And to dropping me off a\nchange of clothes, a cell phone and a driver's license. The only driver's license he had was my driver's license, Brett Johnson. So I was at the camp for, I\ndon't know, six, eight weeks. And the hardest worker that\nlandscaping had ever seen. (laughs) At one point the cops\ngot me on a mountainside with a broom sweeping off the mountain. I'm like, \"Yeah, we'll\ndo that. Absolutely.\" - [Lex] You're building\ntrust of the guys there. - Yeah. Working my ass off. Yeah. And at the end, six weeks I take off and I lasted, I think two, three\nweeks, something like that. US Marshals, I made it a hundred take off.\n- You escaped. - Escaped.\n- Escaped. Escaped US Marshals. They're canvassing a three state area. They find me, I think 250 miles away. It's like Lexington, Kentucky. They find me in Lexington because I had to use my real driver's license. I had a laptop, I had prepaid debit cards and I had stolen identity information. And kind of what the way it\ngot me was I had dyed my hair this flaming red, you\nknow, I had this deep tan. I didn't look anything like myself. And I was at a hotel, had the\ncurtains open, saw this guy. I was on the laptop, saw\nthis guy walk by, he walks by the window and he stops. And then he backs up. He looks inside, he knocks on the window. I look up at him, he is like, \"You.\" I was like \"Me.\" And he's like, \"You.\" Then he pulls out this badge\n(laughs) and he points at it. He's like, and then he\npoints at the door, \"Now.\" So I was like, \"Oh, okay.\" So I open up the door and he\nis like US Marshal Service. So they arrest me. - [Lex] How did they track you down? - They canvassed that area. They talked to every hotel,\neverything else I had- - It's like a traditional,\nlike they were traditional. - Police work is what it was. - So it wasn't like from the internet, they kind\nof got something. I dunno. - Just straight good, good,\ngood, good police work. - [Brett] Parcels are outstanding.\nYeah, everything they do. So they arrest me. I go to a, I'm initially held at a county\njail in Moorhead, Kentucky. And that man, that was one\nhell of an experience there. But then I'm transferred\nafter sentencing on that. So sentencing, here's the weird thing. So I spent like, I think two or three months at the county\njail in Morehead, Kentucky. Get sentenced at my sentencing,\nit happens so quickly after the initial sentencing that they use the exact\nsame pre-sentence report. The report that's got all\nthat drug shit in there. So at my sentencing prosecutor's there, Secret Service is there. Judge me and my attorney,\nprosecutor stands up. He's like, \"Your Honor, we would like it if you would consider that\nwhen Mr. Johnson was arrested, he had a laptop, he had all\nthis information with him. Looks like he was engaged in\nidentity theft, yet again.\" Judge looks at the prosecutor, says \"No.\" Says, \"Hey, if you were gonna charge him with it, you should have\ncharged him with it. I'm only considering the escape.\" Then he looks at me and he's\nlike, \"Mr. Johnson,\" he said, \"it looks like by you keeping\nyour mouth shut right now, you're really saving yourself\na pretty serious charge.\" And my response was, \"Yes, your Honor.\" And he was like, \"Then he opens\nup the pre-sentence report and he's fingering through and he's like, \"It also looks like before you got involved\nwith all these drugs, you were a pretty good citizen.\" I was like, \"Yes, your Honor.\" And he's like, \"so here's\nwhat I'm gonna do.\" He said, \"I'm gonna give you\n18 months on the escape.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" He said, I'm also gonna give you, no, it was 15 months on the escape. He said, \"I'm gonna give you\n15 months on the escape.\" He said, \"and I'm also going to order the drug program for you.\" I was like, \"Yes, your honor.\" So the drug program gives you a year off and it gives you six\nmonths and halfway house. So by escaping, I got outta prison three months earlier than what\nI should have gotten outta. - So the original thing about drugs worked in long.\n- It worked. - Now the interesting thing with that, and this is the best\nlie I ever told, honestly, the best lie I ever told, I spent eight months in solitary\nconfinement. Eight months. And that's an experience (laughs) because you ain't got no books\nfor the first month or so. Then they give you a King James Bible.\n- Bible. - Yeah and then-\n- For a month not books. This is a pretty small-\n- Six by nine room. - Six by nine.\n- Yeah. - No books.\n- No books. No paper, no pen, no pencil. - You are alone with your mind. - [Brett] You got a mat, a toilet. - What's that like? - It's, you sleep as much as you can. You're sleeping 16, 18 hours\na day is what you're doing. - Were you thinking about\neven just going back to like Elizabeth-\n- Oh, you go through all that. The whole thing through all that. Every bit.\n- Your mom too? - Yeah, you're going through\nevery single bit of that. And so you're supposed\nto get out an hour a day. Law says you're supposed\nto get out an hour a day. That's the law. That's not the\nway things actually happen. What actually happens is, is you're lucky to get out an hour a week. You take a shower twice\na week and that's it. You get a phone call once a month. - - [Lex] Oh. So you\ndon't get to see nature. - Don't see anything. You're\nin solitary, all right? And it takes about a week. The\nfirst week is the roughest. You're bouncing off the\nwalls that first week. 'Cause you can't sleep,\ncan't do anything else. Then you start to adapt\nto it after a while. When that book does arrive,\nyou're happy as hell to have it. I'm well versed (laughs)\nin the King James Bible. So you're happy to have it. Then finally, you get\nother books that come in from that point. Spent eight months that, and they send me out to a real prison. Big Spring Texas, West Texas. Where have you been out there? - [Lex] No. - Man, I could tell Prairie Dogs and tarantulas.\n- Yeah. - Is what it is. It got no kidding. It gets so hot, that warnings come on the radio telling you not\nto drive on certain streets because they're melted. That's Big Spring.\n- Oh. - So if you've seen the\nmovie, \"From Dusk till Dawn\", the opening scene is in Big Spring, Texas.\n- It's hot. - Yeah, very hot. So, and that's where I find\nout what a real prison is. And it's not ran by guards.\nPrisons are ran by inmates. And that's a fact. So you're met at the door by whatever race you are is what happens. So Big Spring is a converted\nAir Force compound. It's a disciplinary prison. So you get the bad guys that are in there. So I get, (chuckles) I\ngo through processing and I'm walking up to the unit and I met at the door by\na guy named Nick Sandifer. He's the treasurer of\nthe Aryan Brotherhood. And first question out of his mouth is anymore\nwhite guys come in? And, I didn't know, I was like, \"Hell, I don't know, four or five.\" Next question is, \"What\nare you in here for?\" My answer was, 'cause I'm\nlike, I ain't got no worries. My answer was, \"Computer\ncrime.\" Smiled at him. (laughs) And it turns out wrong thing to say, because computer crime\nis not credit card theft or hacking or any bullshit like that. Computer crime in prison\nis child pornography. So tell him that he looks at\nme like I'm a piece of shit. Goes and gets his buddies. They circle around, \"What\nare you in here for?\" - I like how the Aryan\nBrotherhood has like lines. They're like-\n- Oh yeah. (laughs) This child porn.\n- That's it. That's the bad guy. - They circle around, they're like, \"What'd you say you're in here for?\" So I'm sitting there trying\nto explain it to 'em. They're like, \"You know,\nyou tell a good story. You still said this.\" - Now computer crime basically, really does mean usually\nchild pornography? - In prison, yeah. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. And what you see, and that's\none of the things you find out that the guys that are going\nin there for child porn, they will tell 'em it's credit card theft.\n- Right. - So yeah.\n- Right. They've learned. - So I'm that guy that's-\n- But you also don't, I mean for people who are just listening to this, you don't exactly look like the typical computer hacker. (Brett laughs) - That's true. That's true\n(laughs) that's very true. But I don't look like\nthe pedophile either. - That's right. That's right. But it's like, it doesn't\nmake it seem like you're, I mean, I guess you're not wearing\na hoodie and you're not like Emo dark, you know? - The way it actually works in prison, they won't attack\nyou until they know, all right? So they have to see paperwork, which now in federal prison you\ndon't get transported with paperwork because of that. So they have to see paperwork or a guard will tell them\nwhat you're in there for. Guards will tell who the pedophiles are. So none of the guards told\n'em that I was anything. So for the first month they think I am, but they're not doing anything 'cause they don't know for sure. At the end of the first\nmonth, I'd been talking to Kevin Poulsen over at Wired\nMagazine about Max Butler. He does an article about that\nshows up in Wired Magazine. So at the end of the first month, Wired Magazine hits compound front cover. That's all the story.\n- That saved you. - You would think. You\nwould think it's saved me. So I'm reading the article.\nReally happy about it. So what happens is, is\nfour o'clock is mail call, four o'clock's a standup count nationwide after four o'clock is your mail call, they hand out all the mail for the day. So the mail comes, I get the magazine, I'm like reading through it. I'm like, well shit, I'm good to go. Then it says Brett Johnson,\n\"Secret Service informant,\" in the article. - [Lex] So you're now a snitch? - Which is right up there\nwith the pedophiles. (laughs) So we go to dinner after that. At dinner, you can hear\nit, you can hear the chat. We gotta snitch it. We,\nI think it's that guy. There we go.\n- Yeah. - Warden next day shuts\ndown the entire compound. Calls me into his office. They got security there,\nhe got the counselors there and everything else. Warden looks at me, he is like, \"Did you give an interview\nto Wired Magazine?\" I'm like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"Do you not know\nthey will kill you in here?\" He was like, \"Do you feel safe?\" Well I know if you tell\n'em you don't feel safe, they transport you, transport\nyou means another eight months in solitary confinement. You start to see shit in solitary after a while.\n- Yeah. So I'm like, \"No, I'm not gonna do that.\" So I'm like, \"completely\nsafe.\" He was like, \"Look.\" He's like, \"if anybody says anything to you immediately come to us because they'll fucking kill you.\" So they do a locker search, try to confiscate the magazines, they can't. The next day I walk into the unit, there's Nick Sanderford laying on his bunk magazine wide open reading it. I'm like, oh shit. Walked up to him. I was like, \"Hey Nick,\nwhat are you doing?\" He is like, \"Oh, doing some reading.\" I was like, \"Anything interesting?\" He is like, \"It's getting there.\" (laughs) I was like, \"Let me save you the trouble.\" Take the magazine, turn\nit over to the page. I was like, \"Right there is\nwhat you're looking for.\" He was like, \"Man, I already knew.\" I was like, \"Do we have a problem?\" And he looks at me, he is like, \"Is anyone on the compound you told on?\" I was like, \"No.\" He's like, \"Until someone gets here\nyou snitched on we're okay.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" He's like, \"But I need you\nto do something for me.\" All right, so in federal\nprison, you gotta have a job. Everybody works. Doesn't matter what you\ndo, but you gotta work. I got a job in education\nteaching a lit class every Wednesday, 6:00 to 8:30 PM lit and had every area on\nthe compound signs up for the lit class. Had a couple guards every\nnow and then popped in and did we teach lit? No, we taught fraud\nevery Wednesday, (laughs) 6:00 to 8:30 PM and that's how\nI didn't get my ass beaten. And my other job, I\nhad two jobs with them. The other job, you get to\nthe point, it's weird, man. You get to the point, people\nwalking off the bus, you know, immediately two groups of people, you know who the bank robbers are, immediately just by them walking off the bus, you're like, \"That mother fucker is a bank robber.\" And you know who the\npedophiles are immediately. So my job as the white guy was to approach the white pedophiles\nand have a conversation and the conversation was basically, \"Hey, don't know what you're in here for. Don't care what you're in for, but if you got some sort\nof fucked up charge, you need to tell me. If you tell me everything's\ngonna be all right. If you don't tell me, you\nsee those guys over there. If you start to associate with 'em or they start to talk to you and then they find out you're in here on something, they're going to kill you.\" - [Lex] And what are\nthe things, pedophile. - Pedophile, rapist, anything that harms children, harms\nwomen, anything like that. - So it's like the mob, there's rules, there's an ethical code. Even if you have the\ndivision between races on all that, you still\nhave these lines drawn. - And what that looks-\n- And this hierarchy too. - Very much so. And what that looks like\nin prison, it depends on the security class that\nyou're in, what level prison. But at that prison, what that looked like was you're not\nallowed to talk to anybody. You're not allowed to watch television. You can go to the library. You don't associate with\nanyone except your own type. If you do anything like\nthis, we will kill you. If someone wants to extort\nyou, we will do that too. And you won't tell on\nus or we'll kill you. So that's the way that\nworks at that point. - [Lex] And everybody quickly learns this. - Quickly. Quickly. And so typically the guys would say, I just wanna do my own time. That would be the line. And it's like, okay, don't\nmess with him. Alright? Every now and then\nyou'd have somebody lie. And that would come with\nthose types of consequences. I got to see, while I was\nthere, saw two people murdered, went through three prison riots and through my entire tenure\nin prison, saw four suicides. The people who got killed, so we had a outside, you\nhad this track, a third of a mile track, you\nwalk at counter clockwise and inside of the track you\ngot two handball courts. So of an evening. It happened both times. All of us would be walking,\nyou know, doing our exercises. And at the top of the key, like a flock of birds, you'd\nsee all the inmates start to migrate down toward the gate. So the first time you see that, you see that migration, you\nlook up in the distance and that one inmate's\ngot another inmate down and he is just hammering his\nhead right into the pavement. Like that right there. Well guards don't stop that\nbecause a guard may get hurt. So a guard is 15 minutes\ncoming out to stop that until everything's over. By that point, the guy\ndoesn't have a head. They shut the compound down\nand this is what happens. So you shut the entire compound down. They make two lines of the inmates. And what happens is the inmate walks into a room, they shut the door behind. The inmate guard asks 'em two questions. First question is, did you see\nanything? The answer is no. Second question is, if\nyou had seen anything, would you say anything? Answer is no. Guard then\nsays, \"Get the fuck out.\" And that's it. Anybody that stays in any longer than that is automatically suspect. So there was one incident, I\nremember this Hispanic guy, he's in there for a few\nminutes and everybody's like, what's going on? (laughs) So his people then call him over, explain to us what went on?\n- Yeah. - And it happens like that. - It's fascinating that because you talked about\nthe network of trust in the cyber crime community.\n- Oh yeah. - And here's a network of trusts-\n- Absolutely. - In the prison crime community. - [Brett] Absolutely. - And trust.\n- Trust matters. - Trust drives everything\nat the end of the day. The riots that I went\nthrough, the first riot, man, you're scared to\ndeath, scared to death. You know, you've got the cops dressed up in the ninja turtle outfits. You've got the rubber bullets, the tear gas canisters, all that crap. You got the inmates that are\nraising hell, scared to death. The second riot, you calm down. Second riot, you start to\nnotice this is racial riot. This is typically, and almost always it's\nHispanics and African Americans. - [Lex] So you you get to detect what is the motivation for\nthe riot, what's the reason? - That's exactly right. - [Lex] And that gives you some calm. - That's exactly right. So second riot, you start to notice this, Hey man, this ain't me,\nthis ain't our group. - [Lex] Yeah. - Third riot, no shit. Third riot, you lay in your bunk (laughs) and you let 'em wage war all around you. And every now and then you\nhave an inmate, they'll run up to you and they'll point to a locker and say, is that your locker? And if you tell 'em yes,\nthey leave it alone. If you say it's not my\nlocker, they'll break into it and steal everything out\nof it and go from there. And that's what happens. - [Lex] So you did your\ntime for five years? - Five and a half. - [Lex] Five and a half. You made it out. - Made it out, I went through the, I told you it was a good\nlie that I told, I went through the residential\ndrug abuse program. It's a nine month intensive therapy. And the way I got to that, this counselor at Big Spring, he bought\nthis, he wanted inmates to be educated, he was a really good guy. So he wanted inmates to be educated. He got a discount on a\ngame theory class set. So he gets all these\ndisc good and everything and he's asking, does anybody on the compound know\nanything about game theory? And somebody says, if anybody\ndoes, it'll be Brett Johnson. (laughs) So he comes up to me one day at my bunk, he's like, \"Are you Brett\nJohnson?\" I was like, \"Yeah.\" He was like, \"Do you know\nanything about game theory?\" And I was like, \"Yes I do.\" (both laughing) So I start rattling off prisoners' dilemma and everything else. He's like, \"Will you teach a class?\" So I start teaching that. I start teaching inmates, public speaking and to make friends with this counselor. So it gets time where I'm supposed to be transferring out\nto this drug program that they only had in Fort Worth. And the transfers are taking\nlike four or five months. And that's four or five\nmonths I could be out free. So I went up to him one day and I was like, \"Look.\"\nHis name was Keely. I was like, \"Look man.\" I said, \"is there any way that I can get transferred\nout any sooner?\" And he looks at me, he is like,\n\"Brett, I cannot help you.\" And I was like, \"I appreciate that, thank you so much for even trying.\" So he said that a week later I'm on a bus by going to Fort Worth.\n- Got it? - Yeah.\n- I love it. - So it was a nine month program, 24 hours a day of cognitive\nbehavioral therapy. It had nothing to do with drugs. It was all peer study\nstuff and CBT training. And honestly, it's the best thing that could ever happen, truly is. - Oh, that part. What was the thing that\nchanged you as a man?"

      "section": "Life after prison",
      "text": "Is it the solitary\nconfinement? Was it the years? Was it losing the people you loved? Or was it that behavioral therapy? - It's a combination,\nman. It's a combination. So my sister disowns me. The only person I had\nin my life, I mean, me and my sister, that's it. You know, I mean, yeah, I loved Elizabeth. I love my wife now, but you\nknow, it's me and my sister. We went through all that shit together. So Denise disowns me,\nshe doesn't talked to me for an entire year when\nall this stuff happens. And after I get arrested on the escape, she ends\nup driving seven hours to come see me, to tell me she loves me and I don't see her again\nfor five and a half years. Yeah.\n- Yeah. - So that's really the first turnaround. Took me two and a half years in prison to accept responsibility. Two and a half. - That was amazing that she did that.\n- Yeah. - Because she drove down.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] She did that. - Yeah, she's something. She's something. She saw me for 10 minutes,\ntell me she loves me and then I don't see her. - [Lex] Planted the seed. (laughs) - Yeah. Yeah. - But yeah, you had time\nto think over those years. - Yeah, took two and a\nhalf years to realize that, you know, I didn't commit crime because of stripper\ngirlfriends or wives or family. I committed it 'cause\nI wanted to, chose to. And that's the first turnaround. Second turnaround is like\nthe CBT training, you know, that it didn't really hit\nwhile I was in prison. You know, I went through it\nand they ingrained it in you, but until you choose to make\nit work, it doesn't work. So I got out in 2011, didn't\nwanna break the law. Did not. And I was under three years probation, couldn't touch a computer. I had a job offer from Deloitte to run a cyber crime office in the UK. Which that was a no,\nnow you're not moving. And that's a computer idiot. (chuckles) - [Lex] Yeah. - Then had a job offer from\nno, before a fishing company. Couldn't take that. Got to where I was trying\nto apply for fast food jobs. That's a computer. Can't touch that. Okay? Then what about a waiter's position? Well, that's a computer and\naccess to credit cards. Idiot. Can't touch that either. So literally could not\nget a job, could not. Doing food stamps. I had a roommate that\npaying half the rent. They tell you when you leave prison to get a job in something you care about and you won't recidivate\ncouldn't get a job. And what I had was a cat\n(laughs) it's a Monster, the cat that was the cat's name.\n- That's a good name. - Yeah, I had enough money\nto feed that little guy and didn't have money to buy\ntoilet paper for the apartment. I was on Panama City Beach. - [Lex] How long were\nyou living like this? - It was a steady decline 'cause remember I taught my dad how to commit tax fraud.\n- Yeah. - So he bankrolled a lot\nof that until he couldn't. And then from there it's\nlike, what the fuck do you do? So I didn't wanna go into\ncomputer crime at all. And I ended up shoplifting\ntoilet paper, man. Shoplifting toilet paper. - Just like for the basics?\n- Yeah. - The basics of survival. - So about the same time, I\nhad a friend that (laughs) this guy, I had been dating the same type of women I had been dating. You know these-\n- Yeah. - You know the unhealthy ones, the hot unhealthy ones.\n- Yes. - And (laughs)\n- Love. - Yeah.\n- That's how that works. - Yeah, so I had a\nfriend post an ad for me on Plenty of Fish. And this woman responds,\nmy wife, she responds. And the pictures I had taken were these prison type pictures. You know, the serious like-\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - They were there. And she sends me a message\nof, \"Why aren't you smiling?\" And my response was,\n\"That is my happy face.\" So we start talking and we started dating and she's that second saving thing man. I ended up moving in with\nher. I was going broke. I was about to get kicked\noutta the apartment and everything else. And she didn't say it,\nbut I think she knew it and moved in with her and I got a job. And the job, I got my probation officer to let me have a cell phone. I was going through Craigslist. This guy was advertising for\nlandscaping. Called him up. His name was Dustin Ramos, called him up and he is like, \"Come\non down, talk to me.\" So he was running this business. Him and his brother were out of his house. So I'm sitting there talking\nto him for about 20 minutes. He looks at me, he is like,\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" I was like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"Are you on the\nrun or something?\" (laughs) So I'm like, \"No, why?\" And he is like, \"Well, you just don't look like the kind of guy that do this.\" So I told him, I was like, \"This is who I am, is what I've done.\" And he looks at me, he is like, \"Man, I gotta think about that.\" So he tells me, go on\nhome. That was a Friday. Sunday evening. He gives me a call and\nhe was like, \"Brett.\" He is like, \"If I hire you,\nwill you actually work?\" And I told him, I was like, \"Dustin, if you'll gimme a job, I promise I'll work my ass off.\" And he is like, \"Show up six o'clock.\" I was like, \"Alright.\" So my job was to push a\nlawnmower 10 hours a day, five days a week for $400\na week and busted my ass. I hit it so hard, I had\ncome in end of a night and pass out, wake up the\nnext morning and hit it again. And it got to the point he ended up, this dude ended up offering me to come in, a partner with his business. His brother dropped out and by that point, I'd learned everything on\nthe business and everything. And he was like, you know, \"If you'd like to come\nin, I'll cut you in half.\" And I was like, \"Dustin,\nI can't do it, man.\" Because I wasn't making any money wanted, he didn't wanna pay me anymore until, you know, he was able to do more. And I thought I found another\njob doing something else. And in a speech, I say, it got cold and the grass stopped growing. The truth of the matter was, is I thought I found another job. A guy was offering to pay me\n$1,500 a week doing the sales for oil rig training, was what it was. And I accepted the job. I quit working for Dustin and the guy, before he even offered me the job, I told him what I, you\nknow, my criminal history 'cause I was required to do that. So I was supposed to start work. Well, he calls me and\ntells me he can't hire me. So I'm outta work and Dustin's already hired\nsomebody else by that point. So I can't go back with him. And I'm that guy again,\nman, it's important for me to show value in a relationship. All right? So Michelle\nwas the only one working. I'm like, I gotta do something.\nAnd I get it in my head. I was like, you know\nwhat, if nothing else, I can just bring food in the house. She was only making that. I think, I mean we were headed hard, you know, it was just her working. And I was like, and nothing else. I can bring food in the house and get on the dark web, (laughs) get some stolen credit cards.\n- Yeah. - Start ordering food. Well,\nit gets worse than that. She's got two sons there, so I'm like, well they need clothes. So he starts stealing clothes\nand it continues like that. I get arrested, I get\narrested on a food order and Michelle didn't know what I was doing. So she had been to work and she was coming back from work. I get arrested and I'm like,\nthey let me make a phone call and I call her and I was like, \"Come to police station.\nI've been arrested.\" And she shows up and she didn't\nknow I'd been doing that. My probation officer,\nof course he didn't know or anything else at my\nsentencing for that. Probation officer was there,\nprosecutor, the judge, US Marshals, Michelle and me. Michelle stands up and she tells the judge\nthat I'm a better dad to her kids than their actual father is. And by that point I'm crying. Probation officer stands\nup and he was like, \"We think Mr. Johnson's a good guy. We think this is a one time thing.\" Prosecutor says the same thing. Judge sentences me to one year. Probation officer stands back up and he is like, \"Judge, if you can give Mr. Johnson a year and a day, he can get the good time and get back to his family center.\" So the judge amends a\nsentence to a year and a day. So I served 10 months,\nthey send me back to Texas and that's when I find out\nthat Michelle didn't need me for what I could give her. She just wanted me for\nme that entire time. She stands by me the entire\ntime I do my 10 months get out, we get married after that\nand they kill probation so I can touch a computer. They tell you, they tell you, (laughs) they were like, you know, \"Inmates, a felon. If nothing\nelse, he can sell cars.\" Well it turns out you can't. You can sell cars if you're a drug dealer, if you're the guy that\nsteals all the money in people's information, no fuck no. You can't get a job selling\ncars. So can't get a job. Cannot. And to this day, Lex, I\nknow what my triggers are. I know what it would take to get me back into committing crime. So, and I knew I'd go\nso far at that point. So I looked at Michelle and I was like, \"Lemme see what I can do.\" Signed on to LinkedIn, reached out to this FBI super cop named Keith Mularski outta the Pittsburgh office. He was involved with my arrest and some associates and everything else and sent him a message. And the message was, you know, hey, I respect everything you did. Think you did a great job. By\nthe way. I'd like to be legal. And dude responded within two hours, two hours he gives me\nreferences, advice, takes me in under his wing,\neverything else like that. And from that point, man, it was the head of the identity theft\ncouncil did the same thing. Card not present group hires me to speak, Microsoft hires me to consult with them. And the Microsoft hire\nestablished enough trust in the industry that I was\nall right from that point. - So now you're helping in\nmany ways, fight the very guy that you used to be.\n- Yeah. - So big picture advice,\ngiven that you were that guy, how do we\nfight cyber crime today and in the next 5 years, 10\nyears, 20 years, 50 years? What advice do you have to\nindividuals, to companies, to governments of what\nand also to Elizabeth? (Brett laughs) Like the humans, human\nbeings that love, that live, that are friends with cyber criminals. - There's so many lessons\nto really be had from that. You know, to me, the lesson,\none of the big lessons to me is you can't serve two masters. You know, if you're that\nguy that is committing crime or that person that's\naddicted or you're in love with somebody that's addicted or has that they don't love you, they love that addiction that comes first. It's always gonna come first. So you have to realize\nthat, you have to know when you gotta know when\nto cut somebody off, when to end something that knowing that they're not gonna change\nuntil they decide to change. At the same time, you gotta realize that the only reason I was\nable to turn my life around is because people took that chance on me.\n- Yeah. - You know, that's really the only reason. - [Lex] They believe that\nthere's a good person in there. - Yeah, if Mularski hadn't responded, if I hadn't had my sister,\nmy wife, these companies that initially gave me that chance, my ass would be back\nin prison for 20 years. I have no doubt about\nthat at all. Alright. So you have to realize\nthat, you know, cyber crime, a lot of companies that I talked to, they don't really understand the, or appreciate that networking aspect that that trust aspect of how\ncriminals establish trust with each other, how they work together. A lot of companies think\nthat it's a single player that's out victimizing them. And when you really break\ndown how cyber crime operates, that you've got a group of individuals that are working together to\nhit you, but not only hit you, but they share and exchange\ninformation freely. You know, companies don't do that. You've got privacy concerns, you've got competitive edge\nconcerns, everything else. Companies don't share\ninformation across the board, like criminals do, criminals do that. You have to appreciate that. You have to understand that big statistic, that 90% of their attacks\nuse known exploits. It's not the stuff we don't know about. It's the shit we do know about, we're not doing anything about. - So the way to defend\nagainst cyber crime is like there's a lot of low hanging fruit that you should fix.\n- That a lot of that. A lot of that. - So a lot of basic stuff\nthat's already vulnerabilities. Update the system security. - Yeah. Now that doesn't take care of SolarWinds.\n- Right? - Or CNAP or anything like that. It doesn't but those instances, I mean that okay, that's a big\ninstance. (chuckles) But I mean it is. - But in the full spectrum of-\n- Right. - Especially in the future\nbecause there's more and more companies that are coming online.\n- Right. - They're becoming digital and\nthat it's just more and more and more and those vulnerabilities\nin terms of human nature. So for social engineering and\nthe actual outdated systems, all of it, some of it I guess is the, I mean you're exceptionally good at this is educating on the social engineering side-\n- Right. - Is educating people in companies that- - You've got to do that. And companies have to, you know, I made that point that they never\nreport to law enforcement. That's companies and individuals.\n- Yeah. - You know, I've worked\nwith Fortune 50 companies that will not press charges. Instead, they'll have that insider or that criminal sign, an\nNDA, they'll pay 'em off and we won't mention this shit anymore. You have to press charges, you have to report, you have to raise the awareness of everyone in the group. It's that idea and I've\ntalked about that before of understanding your place\nin that cyber crime spectrum. The way a criminal will victimize\nyou depends on who you are and what you do as a\nperson and as a business. So you have to understand that\ndesign security around that. You know, we've got 7,500\nsecurity companies out there. A whole lot of them\nare snake oil salesman. A lot of 'em, it's going to tell you that we're the one stop solution. But you're not, you're not,\nyou're a tool. Alright? And you may have a very good tool, but it's not the only tool that's needed to protect against the\nattacks that are out there. And we have to be open and\nhonest about that kind of stuff. We're not. - So I guess defense is\nnot just like one tool. It's a process of just like a diversity and just constant educating people.\n- Absolutely. - So it's the social\nside, it's constantly, 'cause there's so many\nprobably attack vectors in terms of the software that you have. - If you look at it, that attack surface. You can't plug everything. It's too damn large to plug everything. But you can do the best\njob you can possibly do. But it takes a variety of\ntools to do that. Alright. The idea and ARCOS is big about that. But the idea is to take the cost of fraud to the fraudster so high\nthat they basically try to pick another target, alright? And that's the idea that\nyou want, you want it to be not worth the criminal's\ntime to hit your company. - What about white hat hacking? So like, you know, hacking for\ngood sort of testing systems and then giving companies\nthe vulnerabilities as you find that. - I think it's outstanding. I do. I think that, I think pen\ntesting white hat stuff is outstanding, I truly do. I think that that you have to. It has to be tempered with\nwhat is reality as well though. All right? You know, we've got a whole\nindustry of of people who try to sell our fit wallets that I don't know of many our fit hackers out\nthere on the criminal side, to be honest with you. (laughs) - Yeah, so some of it's just like a psychological safety blanket that's not actually\nproviding any protection. By the way you wrote on\nLinkedIn something about ID.me. (Brett laughs) What is it? Why is it a problem? I was going down a rabbit hole with-\n- I was wondering if you were gonna mention that. I guess I was partially responsible for them losing an $86 million contract. - What was the contract with?\n- IRS. - [Lex] The government. So what is it? - So ID.me is an identity... Okay backtrack, ID.me\nis a marketing company that wants to say they're an\nidentity verification company. - [Lex] I just wanna bring\nthis up to see you get angry. (Brett laughs) - Okay. I'll tell you what my issue is. - [Lex] Yeah. - My issue is so-\n- So yeah. Yeah. It's a company that's\nused for authentication by the IRS, I guess- - Well IRS, Social\nSecurity administration VA at one point 23, state\nunemployment offices, few other services. - So I guess the idea is\nthat you would be able to unlock your account\nor authenticate yourself as a human being by using your face or something like that-\n- Yeah. - Or private information. - They've got a tiered\nsystem by the verification. They've got a free system, which is questionable\nwhere you submit an ID and it's been shown,\nseveral bypasses been shown. And I don't wanna talk about\ntheir security horribly bad because I wanna be\nhonest, there are bypasses for a lot of security systems out there.\n- Right. - All right? The issue that I have with ID.me is that their policies are\nsomewhat questionable. I don't care if you're a private company that has those policies in place, but if you're a government agency and you as a citizen are\nentitled to a benefit or a service of that government agency and then the government agency forces you to give up your complete identity profile to a private company and then\nthat private company uses that profile for marketing purposes to further profit, things like that. I have a huge issue with that. I don't care if you're a\nprivate company that does that. I just don't think that citizens need to be forced into doing that in order to get a benefit or service that they're entitled to.\n- Yeah. - So that's my big issue. - So I mean, given how much value, how much we talked about\nthe value of identity, you don't think that should\nbe handed over lightly? - No, absolutely not. And who would've thought\nthat Brett Johnson would ever become a privacy advocate? (laughs) But here I am. (Lex chuckles) I mean, it's just people don't understand or appreciate the value of who they are. You know? And certainly you've\ngot a host of companies, ID.me means not the only one, but you've got some of these companies that say, well, we strip out\nthe PII of the individual, we're just using the biometrics and the sites they're\nvisiting and things like that. That's identity, you can still ping that one unique individual\nout of all using that information, stripping\nout the PII you can still ping who that individual is. - So having lived a life\nof crime for many years, I'm sure you've connected\nindirectly to a large number of very dangerous people. - [Brett] Indirectly\nand directly. (laughs) - Yeah. But the network indirectly\nis is even larger, right? - [Brett] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. - I apologize for this\nquestion, are you ever worried for your life or your wellbeing? Like having seen a world\nthat's really dangerous in ways that operates in the shadows. - You know, like I said,\nwhen we started ShadowCrew and started that initial\ncyber crime business, that world, violence wasn't\nthere, it came in later. Now violence is inherent in the system to do the Monty Python\nbit, it's part of it. - [Lex] Yeah, the mob, the mafia are now part\nof this whole thing. - Cartels are part of it.\n- Yeah. - Drugs are inherently in intertwined in cyber crime marketplaces\nbecause of the profit potential. And with that comes a\nlot of violence as well. - Yeah, the cartels have\nalready brought the violence that they're good at\nfrom the 20th century. - [Brett] Absolutely. Absolutely. - Into the technology of the 21st century. - Now do I worry about that? It's interesting that my\nfamily worries about that. All right? I think I may be just too involved in it to appreciate that type of danger. But my family worries about that. They do. Do I think it's a possibility? I'm the guy that says\nwhat needs to be said. I've built my trust in this industry by not being scared of\ncalling out companies and individuals and not being scared of targeting criminals or criminal groups. - Your honesty as a\nhuman being emotionally and intellectually is really\nrefreshing, it's a gift. Thank you, thank you for doing that."

You want your life to be one\nwhere you're helping people and not hurting people. And that really hit me\nthe first time I walked into Quantico. You know, that's, you\nsee the brightest minds in the United States who\ngive up a lot of money, the opportunities, a lot of money because they believe in helping people.

If we do all right, if we\nmake it out of this century, what do you think would be the reason? - [Brett] What would be, well,\nthat's a damn good question, because I mean, we got a\nlot of bad stuff going on. - We've got a lot of reasons.\n- A lot of reasons. - If asked you the other question of how do you think human\ncivilization will destroy itself? I'm sure you have a lot\nof answers. (laughs) - Oh yeah. You know what, what gives me hope is you see people working together. COVID has have been a little bit different because I think that\ntoo many people wanted to play politics with it. - That's been the heartbreaking\nthing about COVID, is it's in many ways pull people apart. I mean, because a virus involves kind of being afraid of each other because, I mean, that was a scary thing. People talk about pandemics in that way, that you're afraid of other humans. That is the most terrifying thing. It's not the destructive\nnature of what it does to your body, it's just\nthat it pulls people apart. And then you realize how fundamental that human connection is to humans. - Absolutely. Absolutely. But you know, as human beings,\nwhen things really get bad, when things really get\nbad, we do tend to respond and group together, we do that. - There's injustice.\n- Yeah. - We see it, we rise up. - I wake up in the morning\nand I watch Fox News and CNN, so I can be\npissed off at everyone.

Elizabeth was very good. She taught me one hell\nof a lesson, because before I met her, I was a news hound.

The daily ups and downs of the outages, which is getting worse and\nworse in terms of how quick the turnaround is in terms of the news. - I'll tell you what, I'm sitting here. I appreciate you talking to me. I do. Because, you know, I'm talking about that relationship and everything. It's really been this kind of realization for me on a lot of things. So I really appreciate\nyou asking those questions and everything. Me being able to talk about that. - I love it that you value, first of all, you're self-aware\nhow important love is in a human being's life.

The night before, I'd\nstolen 160K out of ATMs. The next morning I woke up, signed on to cardersmarket.com, which was ran by Max Butler, the Iceman. And there's my name, US Most Wanted on it. And that gets your attention. It was my real name with the\nUS Most Wanted beside of it. Nobody knew my real name\nin that environment at all, but then they did. And it was talking about me being part of the Secret Service\nOperation, AnglerPhish, everything else. So, of course they're all like-\n- So everybody's after you. - They're like, oh yeah, we're\ngonna get the son of a bitch. - The following is a conversation with Brett Johnson, a\nformer cyber criminal who built the first organized\ncyber crime community called ShadowCrew. That is the precursor to today's darknet and darknet markets. He's referred to by the\nUnited States Secret Service as quote, \"The Original\nInternet Godfather.\" He has been the central figure\nin the cyber crime world for almost 20 years, placed\non the US Most Wanted list in 2006 before being\nconvicted of 39 felonies for cyber crime, escaped from prison, and then eventually being\nlocked up, served his time, and now is helping people\nunderstand fight cyber crime. This was a raw, honest,\nemotional, and real episode. Brett has caused a lot of\npain to a lot of people, and yet his own story is\nfull of trauma and pain, and also redemption and love. This is a good time to say that I have, and I will talk to people who\nhave served time in prison and perhaps people who\ncurrently are in prison. I will try to do my best to both empathize with the person across from me and not let them sugarcoat, explain away or dismiss the crimes they committed. This is a tough line to walk because if you close your\nheart to the other person, you'll never fully understand\ntheir mind and their story. But if you open the heart too\nmuch, you can be manipulated to where the conversation\nreveals nothing honest or real. This requires skill and\nwillingness to take the risk. I don't know about the skill part, but I'd like to take the risk. I always wear my heart on my sleeve. If I get hurt for it, that's life. As I've said, I want to understand what makes a person do these crimes, the particular characteristics\nof their temporary or permanent madness,\ntheir justifications, but also their humanity. I believe each of us have the capacity to become both the criminal and the victim, the predator and the prey. It's up to us to avoid these paths or to find the path to redemption. It's on each of us. It's our responsibility and burden of being human in a complicated and dangerous world. This is the \"Lex Friedman Podcast\". To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Brett Johnson. You were convicted of 39\nfelonies for cyber crime placed on the US Most Wanted list in 2006, escaped from prison. You built the first organized\ncyber crime community called ShadowCrew, that is the\nprecursor to today's darknet and darknet markets. And for all this, the US\nintelligence service called you the original internet Godfather. So first question, how did your career as a cyber crime criminal begin? - My life of crime begins\nwhen I'm 10 years old. 10 years old, man. Think about that. I mean, you were probably playing the robots when you were 10. You know, usually kids\nare doing the Lego bit, getting involved with\nsports, everything else. And with me, it wasn't like that. With me, I'm from Eastern Kentucky. Eastern Kentucky is one of\nthese, it's like parts of Texas, parts of Louisiana that if\nyou're not fortunate enough to have a job, you may be\ninvolved in a scam, hustle, fraud, whatever you wanna call it. Man, my parents, my mom\nwas basically the captain of the entire fraud industry. So this is a (chuckles) woman that at one point, she's stealing\na 108,000 pound Caterpillar, D9 bulldozer, (chuckles)\ntramming it down the road. You know, at another\npoint she's taking a slip and phone, a convenience\nstore, trying to sue the owner. We had a neighbor, she acted\nas a pimp for at one point. That's my mom, my dad- - Wait, wait, the\nneighbor acted as a pimp? - My mom prostituted. I mean, she acted as\na pimp for a neighbor. Her name was Debbie. And my\nmom used to sell her out. You know, Debbie needed money,\nand my mom would find men for her to sleep with for cash, and she'd take a part of the cash. - So, sounds like she\ndiversified the methodologies by which she hustled. - Very had that entrepreneurial\nspirit. (laughs) - [Lex] Okay. - We see that a lot with cyber criminals, that sense of being that entrepreneur. - So what was the motivation,\nyou think, for her? Is it money? Is it basically the rush\nof playing with the system, of being able to know the\nrules and break the rules and get away with it? - My mom's a complex character. There's no one single motivation. So my mom was the individual.\nShe's still alive. My mom was the individual\nwho tested people. She wanted to know how\nfar she could abuse you, and you come back and still love her. So, and that was with every\nrelationship she's ever had, she would cheat on the\nmen she was involved with. She would abuse the her\nchildren, me and Denise. She would-\n- Psychological, physical? - Oh, it was mental, emotional,\nphysical, everything. Everything. I mean, she, she used\nto beat me and Denise with belt buckles, you know, and that ended when (laughs)\nI forgot what we had done. It wasn't much, I think that\nit may have been the part where she accused me of\nstealing her marijuana, but she was hitting me\nand Denise, we were living in a single wide trailer at that point. She was hitting me and Denise. We were on the bed trying\nto get away from it. And Denise kicks her through\na closet, is what happens. And Denise stands up and she said, \"You're through hitting me.\" And that was the last time that mom hit us at that point. But- - So sorry to take us there. For people who know you, and people should definitely watch some of your lectures online,\nyou're extremely charismatic and fun and jolly and\nwhatever word you wanna use. But, you know, if we look at that kind of life, there's darkness there, there's struggle there. - [Brett] There's a lot of darkness. - So, how did you feel? If you go back to the\nmind of the kid you were with your mom, was there sadness? Was there things like\ndepression, self-doubt, all those kinds of things? Or did you see this crime, this chaos as ultimately, exciting? - You know, back then, I\ndidn't view it as exciting. Now it becomes exciting\nwhen I start being involved in cyber crime, cyber crime, all right? But back then, it was simply a means to an end was all it was. So, you take a 10-year-old kid, and the way I get involved in crime is, like I said, my mom was the fraudster. My my dad was a good guy. He just forgot he was this good guy. You know, he always had these principles. But his issue was is he\nloved my mom so much. He was scared of her leaving. So if she wanted to do\nsomething, commit crime, cheat on him, whatever, he\nwould pretty much just put up with it. I mean, this woman used to, she used to bring men home in front of him. Tell him that, \"Hey, I'm leaving you. I don't love you anymore.\nI want you to die.\" Blah, blah, blah, blah,\nblah. This was my mom. There were two instances where\nhe can't take it anymore. And the first instance I\nguess I was seven or eight. My sister Denise is a\nyear younger than I am. My dad actually files for\ndivorce, files for divorce at that point. My mom kind goes crazy.\nMy dad, I was with my dad. My sister was with my mother, because that's that\nEastern Kentucky mentality. You know, men stay with\nmen, women stay with women. So he was filing for divorce. Me and my dad, we were\nliving in an apartment. My mom was living with her grandparents and with her parents, bouncing back and forth between the two. And I remember I was sleeping in the bed. We had a single wide bed.\nMy dad slept on the sofa. I woke up one night and\nthere was some sort of ruckus in the living room. So I wake up and I walk\ninto the living room and my mom has a knife to my dad's throat. And basically, you're not\ngonna steal my son from me. My mom was this individual\nthat when she knew she went so far, like I said, she\nwas always this person that tested, well, can I do this to you? And you'll still come back. She was always also this person that if she went too far, she knew it. And she would always try to\ndivert that into something else. All right? So she knew at\nthat point she'd went too far. So what does she do? She gets up crying, goes to the bathroom and\npretends to slit her wrists. So that my dad, Ray will\nrespond to that, not respond to what she's just done to him.\n- Hmm. - That was my mom in a nutshell. And she had a history of\ndoing this kind of stuff. Motivations as far as fraud with her. I think with her it was, she was an LPN and a very good nurse, but she didn't want to\nwork was a lot of it. So with her, it was easier\nfor her to commit fraud. And when I say commit fraud,\nit was against businesses, against people. I remember at one point, she's buying over the counter capsules\nand emptying the capsules out and putting some other crap in there. And selling at a speed.\nAnd people are buying it. She did anything she could for money. And of course I get involved with that. What happens is, we were in east, we were in Panama City at that point. And my mom leaves my dad and (chuckles) the way she left my dad, my great-grandfather had died. My mom tells all three of us, \"Hey, I'm taking the\nkids and we're going back to Eastern Kentucky to\nattend the funeral.\" Well, that was her leaving.\nMe and Denise didn't know it. She didn't pack any, any\nof our clothes at all. She stores her clothes\nin the trunk of the car. And she leaves my dad and I\ndon't get to see my dad again for I think five, six\nyears, something like that. My mom, like I said, she used to bring men home in front of my dad. She would, (chuckles)\nhe'd sit there and cry and beg her not to do it. She'd do it anyway. When\nleaves them, she kept up that. So we were living at\nmy grandparents' house. My grandfather, he had\nconverted the house. He had raised the house up and built apartments underneath of it. So me and my sister and my mom lived in one of the apartments underneath. And that whole side of the\nfamily was just nuts. Was nuts. My granddad Paul, he would,\n(laughs) this is a man that he didn't want you\nto eat any of his food. So, you know, there\nwas no such thing as me and Denise going upstairs to eat. If he found out, me and\nDenise was taking a bath, we were allowed to bath and bathe in two inches\nof water one time a week because he didn't wanna\nhave to pay the water bill. - [Lex] There's rules. - The rules, you know,\nyou couldn't have the TV on when he went to bed at night, you had to have the television, the\nvolume you could watch it, but without volume. Because if he heard it, he\nwould get up in the middle of the night and he would\nkick the power breaker, turn off all the power on you. This the family, right? So my mom, she used to leave me and Denise at home for\ndays, man, for days. She'd go out and, you know, party and I mean, sometimes she'd\ntake me and Denise with her. We'd wait in the car, sometimes\nwe'd wait in the living room and she went and partied\nand everything else. Most of the time she left us at home and my entry into crime. Denise walks in one day,\nshe's nine years old man. She walks in one day and she's got a pack of pork chops in her hand looked at her and I said, \"Where'd you get that?\" And she's like, I stole it.\" And you know, it's like,\n\"Show me how you did that.\" So she takes me over and she\nshows me how she steals food, how she's stuffing it down her pants. So we start stealing food. I'm like, \"Hell yeah, let's do that shit.\" So start stealing food and we get to the point where\nwe're wanting a sandwich. Well, you can't stuff a loaf\nof bread down your pants. So there was a Kmart\nin the shopping center. I go over to the Kmart,\nget a hoodie off the rack, take the tags off of it,\nwear it out, work just fine. And the way you steal\nbread is you put the hoodie over your shoulder stuff a loaf of bread down the sleeve\nand you walk out with it. So we started doing that. - [Brett] How'd you figure that out? - Just thought pattern. - So you said there's like\nstrategic thinking here? - You know, you can't wear the hoodie and put the bread down here 'cause you might mash the\nbread when you zip it up or they might.\n- Yeah. We have to think through that. - You gotta think through it.\n- Okay. - But you gotta realize\nby, by this point I'm, hell, I'm already seeing\nwhat my parents are doing. You know, I'm already seeing. (laughs) - So plotting that kind of puzzle solving was something you already developing yourself individual-\n- Oh yeah. - 'Cause you're pretty young. - Yeah. 10 years old, pretty young. But seeing how they act,\nhow they respond to things and my mom, I guess you'd\ncall it a good thing, they never kept any of that hidden from the kids.\n- Yeah. - You know, there was no\ndiscussions behind closed doors. All that happened in front of everybody. - And from your young mind's perspective, seeing that kind of\ncrime, you basically... You know, a lot of us\nkind of grow up thinking there's rules you're\nnot supposed to break. If you see other humans\nbreaking those rules, then you realize those\nrules are just human made. - But it gets worse than that. I was in an environment where\nthere were no decent people. I didn't really meet\nmy first decent person until I was 16 years old. - [Brett] Who's that? - That was a high school teacher. So what happens is, you know,\nwe start shoplifting food. My mom finds out that\nwe've been stealing stuff and you know, she joins us.\n- What's that? - She joins us.\n- She join (laughs) - Yeah, she comes in, you\nknow, I've got television, I've got the Atari 2600, play the hell out of it.\n- Oh my God. - And she starts seeing this shit. She's like, \"Where'd this come from?\" And I'm like, \"Well, we found it.\" She's like, \"You didn't find that.\" Denise stands up, \"We stole it.\" My mom, \"Show me how you did that.\" And she gets her mom too, to join in. And she used to run me and Denise as these little shoplifters. We'd steal stuff for her, we\nwould distract security and her and my grandmother would steal stuff. They got caught doing that. But that's the entry into crime. And Denise, you know, I'm\nadamant and I kind of mean it. (laughs) But the truth is, I say, and I do mean it that I'm responsible for my choices as an adult. Alright? I believe that when you're a child, you can't control that the adults in your environment control what you do.\n- Yeah. - All right, once you're an adult though, your choices are yours. Now that being said, you can't dismiss that childhood influencing\nwhat I did as an adult. You can't do that. I mean, it was kind of written on slate that, hey, this guy's gonna\nbe this guy when he grows up. - That said, like, sometimes\nthat one person you meet, that decent person can\nturn the tides life. - Absolutely. Absolutely. So what happens is the abuse,\neverything continues on. When I'm 15, my dad was\nin Panama City, Florida. We were in Hazard, Kentucky.\nShe was dating this guy. She and my mom was this guy, this woman that the abuse would,\nit was crazy abuse man, just crazy stuff. She would tell me and my sister, you know, that she gave up her life for us. That she was gonna leave\none day and never come back. That we'd find her dead\nin a ditch someplace. She'd go out and date these\nmen and she'd come back and she'd talk about how\nthese men were abusing her. You know? So she'd be dating this\nguy and she'd come back and she'd start talking\nabout how he had tried to rape her, you know, trying\nto get me to respond to that. And I would respond to\nthat, make no doubt. I would respond to that. Well, what happens is, and\nI knew that, I don't know if I knew it was abuse\nat that age, alright. But I knew things were\nfucked up. (chuckles) And I was talking to\nmy dad in Panama City, and I really had it in my\nhead that I was gonna go down and live with my dad. And I called my dad one day, I was set to go to me and\nmy cousins were gonna go see a, \"Return of the Jedi\",\nthat had came out again in theaters. So I called my dad it a\nSunday, called my dad. And he told me he had\neither gotten married or he was about to get\nmarried to this woman. And basically, Brett\nJohnson wasn't gonna go down to Florida. I was gonna stay in Hazard. I had to call my dad from payphone. But the result of that was I walked into a hospital, got in an elevator, and a woman got in an\nelevator at the same time, and I snapped and beat the hell out of her right there and I was 15. Didn't really know what the fuck happened. Didn't really know, but just- - Anger came from someone. - Yeah, yeah. And you know, the elevator\nbeat the hell outta this lady. Turned out she looked\na shitload like my mom. But the elevator door was open. One of the security guards I\nplayed basketball with his son. So he saw me immediately. I knocked the hell outta him,\ntook off running, made it back to the house where my grandparents were. They didn't know what had happened. So I didn't say anything. About an hour later, Kentucky\nState Police, they pull up in the front yard and two of 'em get out, and I'm sitting on the front porch and me and my cousins and they start walking up. Well, everybody starts\nwalking outta the house. And I just remember\nsaying, what do you want? What do you want? Well,\nyou knew what they wanted. They wanted to arrest Brett\nJohnson and they arrested me. I went in and I told 'em everything. Spent three months in a county jail. They didn't have juvenile\nfacilities in that county. So I spent three months in solitary, went to trial, pled guilty to\nassault in the first degree. The judge sentenced me to time served and a psychological\nevaluation where they sent me to Louisville, Kentucky\nand spent 30 days up there. And they cut me loose. They wanted me to have\ncounseling after that. And they went to counseling,\nyou know, wanted to, but mom was like, don't need it. And (chuckles) so never\nwent to counseling. And I became this pariah in\nthe county, it's crazy, man. I mean, not a day goes by\nthat, I don't think about that- - [Lex] That moment in the elevator. - Yeah and what happens\nyou're 15, man, you're 15. So I go back to the high\nschool that I was in, and I'm this piece of shit. - So everybody knows the outcast? - Everybody knows, everybody knows. So I move, we moved. We were\nin Iceberg we at that point. I finish up the year\nthere and moved to back to Perry County which is where Hazard is. So we moved there and they've\ngot three high schools there. They've got M.C. Napier,\nthey've got Hazard High School, and then they've got\nDi Combes High School. So I was within Med Denise,\nwere within half mile of M.C. Napier show up there\nthe first day of school. And I met me and my mom\nand my sister were walking into the school and the\nkids won't let me in. The kids stand out there,\nhe's not coming in. So my mom starts raising hell and I'm like, \"No, let's\njust go, let's go.\" So from there, we went down\nto the city school Hazard and the principal tells my mom, \"Denise can come, he can't.\" So my mom wants to raise hell. And I'm like, \"No, just take me to this other school.\" So this other school is like 15 miles away and you know, country\nschool, country high school. So I go there and they accept me. And I walked in the first day, and this English teacher\nname's Carol Combs. I walked in and handed her the paper. I, she was my homeroom teacher. And she heard this voice is\nthe way she explains it today. She heard this voice and\n(laughs) she looks up and she was like, \"Son, have you ever\ndone any drama before?\" (both laughing) And I'm like, \"No ma'am, but I'm interested in the academic team.\" I was this quick recall guy, right? And she was like, \"No,\nshe's like drama.\" (laughs) And I'm like, \"No, I'm\nnot interested in theater. I'm interested in academics.\" Well, she was the head\nof the drama department and head of the academics department. So the deal was, tell\nyou what, you can get on the academics team if\nyou start with theater too. And I was like, \"Okay.\" So what happens is, she was\nthe first decent person I met in my life. And she became this kind\nof surrogate mother to me. So under her tutelage, I become the one of the top academic team guys\nin the state around there. I was captain of the team. I was, this just scourge\nacross all the counties in that part of Kentucky. If, you know, we had a meet. It was like Jesus Christ,\nthat's Brett Johnson. (laughs) And you know, it was like, she used to tell people\nthey would, the high school that I came from was Weisberg. And the first time that\nWeisberg came against us, she told me I was talking\nto her about a year ago and she told me, she's like, \"Brett.\" She said, \"that first\nmeet against Weisberg.\" She said, \"the captain\ncame in, looked at you and said, 'oh, you've got that\nJohnson boy on your team.'\" And she said, my response was, \"That\nJohnson boy is our team.\" (both laughing) So, but I did that. And then with theater, I\nended up, my senior year, I won best actor and actress in the state. Only God ever do that in the\nstate. So did pretty well, man. Did pretty well. Had scholarships coming out of high school and everything else. And I'm the idiot that turned them down. - Ask you a funny question? - Yeah. - I mean, of all the many\nthings you could probably do, you would make a hell of a actor. - I'm very good on stage.\nI'm very good on stage. - Have you acted\nprofessionally anywhere or not? - Not, not professionally. We've done the college\ncircuit, stuff like that. What happened was, is, so I turned down the\nscholarships, you know, scared of leaving, I guess is what it was. Started community college. And the community college there hires a new theater director out of California. Well, he knew the guy that ran the San Jose\nState Theater program. A guy named Edward Emanuel was\nhis name. His claim to fame. He had written the three\nninjas movie. Remember that? The three little ninja\nkids back in the '80s? He had written this film and it had made a shit load of money. So he invites Ed Emanuel to\ncome down and see the play. And Ed had written this civil war piece. So we put that on, I was doing like, it was a multiple role thing. I was doing like 18\ndifferent roles in the show. So Ed sees the show and he\nwas like, \"Scholarship.\" He said, \"look.\" He said, \"Right now you're\na big fish in a small pot. We'll make you a big fish in a big pot.\" And I was like, \"Deal.\" So I took the scholarship man. And he was like, \"I'll\nbe back in two weeks.\" So he flies out. Two weeks\nlater, this guy flies back in. He drives down to where I'm living. I'm out shooting ball with\nmy cousins and friends. He pulls up and he gets outta the car. And I was like, I'm walk over to him. I was like, \"Hey man, I'll walk in.\nYou can meet my parents.\" He's like, \"No, I got\nit.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" So I keep shooting ball. He walks in the house,\nstays about 15 minutes, walks out white as a sheet. Doesn't say a word to me,\ngets in the car, leaves. I don't hear from him again.\nHad no idea what went on. Takes me a couple weeks. What happened is my mom, he walks in, introduces himself, my mom\npulls a knife on the guy. \"I will kill you. You are not gonna steal\nmy goddam son from me.\" Scares the guy to death. He bugs out and kind of broke\nmy spirit at that point. I was like, okay. So went into just full fledged into scams, crimes, everything else. I had already been, when I was a minor, I'd already been kind of\nbrought up on that side of the family with the\ncrimes that they were doing. And my mom was, you know, drug\ntrafficking, the pimp stuff, illegally mining coal, charity fraud.\n- Illegally mining coal. - Yeah. - Can you explain that? - Yeah, so to to properly mine coal, you have to get a permit, all right? Eastern Kentucky, a lot of people, they can't afford the permits. You know, they can get\n'em a piece of equipment, you know, you get a dozer, a loader or whatever you're gonna get\nor an auger or what have you. So you start mining, but\nyou don't get the permit. So you don't have to pay\nback, then it was like $3,500 for a two acre permit or\n$5,000 for a two acre permit. Let you strip mine the coal on that. Then you have to pay for the\nreclamation on top of that. So once you uncover the pit,\ntake the coal out, you have to cover back up the pit sew\ngrass, make sure everything is environmentally friendly. You got a silt pond,\neverything else at that point. - So the whole idea is\nyou buy an acre of land or some area of land and there's a whole\nprocess you're supposed to go through.\n- Entire process. - How many people are\ninvolved in a mining? The smallest number of people required for a mining operation? - You can do it with three or four people.\n- Okay. - So you've got your loader operator, you've got your dozer operator, you can farm out the trucking\nto someone if you need an or trucking company,\nif you need to do that. Then you've got whoever\nowns the business as well. So very few people can\nrun an operation like that and profit fairly well\nas long as you don't have to do the reclamation, all\nthat crap on top of it, right? The reclamation gets pretty expensive. So if you're uncovering a\npit of coal, you know, a pit. So a ton of coal is basically\nabout 36 cubic inches is what 2000 pounds of coal weighs if you're in Eastern Kentucky. 'Cause it's at the weight of the by two minutes coal and everything. - The fact that, you\nknow, this is awesome. (Brett laughs) The fact that you know exactly\nthe volume of a ton of coal. I mean, this is great.\n- Yeah. (Brett laughs) You learn this shit. You rattle this off. So you uncover the pit and\nyou've gotta sell the pit. Well the thing is that where are you gonna sell the coal? Well, you sell it to one\nof these other coal tipples that knows that they're\nbuying the shit illegally. So back then a ton of coal was, that'd give you like 36 bucks\nper ton is what that is. And you'd have to go out and\nyou'd test the BTUs on it. You'd take a sample to the lab test the BTUs, you'd take that into company.\n- BTU? - What's British Thermal Unit. So you'd test what the BTU on the coal was.\n- How pure the coal is. - How pure the coal is. What\nBTU it burns at back then. A good BTU was around\n12.9 was what you'd get. Alright? So 12.9 coal, $36 a ton. You'd take that sample\nover to the coal tipple. They'd say, \"Okay, we'll buy this for you. How many trucks you got\nor how many tons you got?\" And you'd say, \"This is what we've got.\" Then you'd hire the trucking company and where you get it out because you know, you've got\nthe agents that are looking for you by this point because the people that you\nknow, you've bought the rights to whoever the landowner is. You said you're gonna give them $2 a ton or whatever this is. Well, there are other people there. Are you paying them off or are you not? Well, if you're not paying\nthem off, guess what? They know your ass is mining it illegally. They're gonna report you. Well, all of a sudden you've\ngot all these inspectors that are coming around and everything and \"Hey, we know what you're doing.\" So they're looking for\nyou to get the pit out. So when do you get the pit\nout? Right dead of night. (laughs) So, you know, you're\nloading it up two o'clock in the morning, hauling this\nass out, is what you're doing. And you sell it out from there. - And your mom ran operations like this? - [Brett] Yeah. Yeah. - And you said you worked the mine too. - Yeah. When you were younger,\nlearned how to run a loader, run a dozer, learned how to\nclean off a pit, (laughs) everything like that fact. So this is the lifestyle you grow up in. You know, you learn how to do this stuff. And so knew how to do\ncharity fraud as well. Insurance fraud.\n- Charity fraud. Can we break down some of these are? - Charity fraud, it's much more romantic than what it sounds. (both laughing) It was basically, it was\nbasically standing beside the road with a sign and a bucket.\n- Yeah. - Taking up collections\nfor homeless shelters for abused women for\nchildren, stuff like that. Then later on I branched\noff, when I started off on my own, I would set\nup my own charity company and do some telemarketing. Go on buy and collect\nchecks and things like that. - You know, we're gonna talk about that. But actually, can we just step back and talk about your mom?\n- Sure. - And your dad. Given all of that, given all\nthe abuse, the complex ways that she played with love.\n- Right. - To see how far she can push\nyou and the people around her. And they still love her\ntoday. Do you love her? - You know, I called my dad yesterday. My dad, he's dying now.\nHe's got a heart condition. He's not gonna get the\noperation to fix it. So he is like, \"Fuck it, I'm ready to go.\" And I'm like, I looked at him. 'Cause hell, I'm 52 now, and prior to 52, I'd have been like, no,\nyou need to do this. But I looked at him and I was like, \"I understand, I\nunderstand you're done.\" And so he is not gonna get the operation. I was talking to him yesterday and he asked me, he is like,\n\"Have you seen your mom?\" And I was like, \"Dad, I've not talked to\nher for about two years.\" And I told him, I was\nlike, \"I love my mom, but my mom is not a\ngood person, she's not.\" And he told me, I was talking\nto him on the phone yesterday and he told me that it\ntook him several years to really understand that. He loved her too. But when you're getting abused\nlike that, especially my dad. My dad came from a good\nfamily, everything else and, you know, upstanding family. And (chuckles) I think that\nwhen you're that victim of abuse, you know, you've\nnever seen it before. You've never encountered it. And then it happens where\nyou're like, that frog in water all of a sudden. You get to the point\nwhere gradually increases until how do you get out of it? Everybody else sees what's\nhappening. But you don't. I grew up in that environment though. So it took me a long time\nto come to terms with that. My sister came to terms\nwith it long before I did. You know, my sister, she's been a decade without talking to my mom. Like she had tried to commit\nsuicide. I didn't know that. What got me so bad is\nshe said at one point that she always thought\nsomeone was gonna come in and save us. And my response, just immediate response, not even thinking about it. My response was, \"Well, Denise,\nI knew no one ever was.\" And looking at things now, I think that's where our path's diverged. Me it was, if you're gonna do it, if anybody's gonna take care of you, you gotta take care of yourself. - [Lex] You're on your own. - You're on your own.\nYou know, it's up to you. And Denise has always been that that child that has expected someone\nto come in and save her. - Well and almost like\nit's all going to be okay. Somebody-\n- Yeah. - And it wasn't.\n- No. - Unless you-\n- Unless you make it okay, it ain't gonna be okay. - Are you able to forgive her, your mom? My boundary with my mom,\nthe reason I've not spoken with her over two years ago, I started this legal career of mine. I've been the guy who\nhas, I spent a lot of time thinking about my past and those choices and what brought those choices around. So I'm big about taking\nresponsibility for my actions. I truly am. I think it's really important\nyou have to do that. Well, my mom, not so much. So I was talking to her,\nyou know, she would start the conversation talking about she didn't understand why Denise\nwouldn't speak to her anymore. That was one of her tropes. So, and my response started to become, \"Well because you were the abuser and you spent your life doing that to her. So it's more healthy for\nher not to talk to you.\" - So she's still not able to see the flaws in her ways of the past? - No, not at all. So my ultimatum to my mom\nwas, \"Look, when you're able to admit that you abuse the\npeople in your life, accept that responsibility and be\nable to discuss it with me. We'll have a talk other than that, I don't wanna talk to you anymore.\" So for the first year it\nwas, you know, calling, cussing my wife out, cussing me out. I don't need you out, blah,\nblah, blah, blah, blah. And then finally it started to taper off. And she's never really\ncontacted me after that point. - Your dad is dying.\n- Yeah. - What do you take from the\nway he's taken on death? Just saying, fuck it. - [Brett] You know, it's the man- - And what have you learned from your dad? What do you love about your dad? - He's one of these guys that,\nyou know, like I told him, I told my dad about the\nabuse and everything else, so, you know, I told you\nabout the elevator stuff. - [Lex] Yeah. - But before that, man,\nit took me 40 years to talk about that. But it also took me 40\nyears to talk about... There was a point that my mom\nand dad would leave the house and I would urinate in the floor. All right? - Is like, out of anger? - No, no idea why, alright. But\nI would, piss on the carpet. Piss on the carpet, piss\nlike the little baski, right? (both laughing) That really tied the room together. - Dude, it really tied the room together. - I was talking about that. And this lady comes up to\nme after the presentation and she had a career previous\nto that where she dealt with abused kids. And she told me, she's like, \"Brett.\" she's like, \"it's a control mechanism. The only control you had was that.\" And she's like, \"kids do that.\" And I was like, \"So I'm not unique?\" She's like, \"No, you're\nnot unique in that.\" So that, you know, there\nthis whole history of abuse. Denise dealt with it\nby drinking, by trying to commit suicide, things like that. And then finally she escapes,\nI'm the kid that didn't. And not only that, my wife\npointed out to me that it's, again, it's that Eastern\nKentucky mentality stuff. You know, the males expected to do things. So with, with me it was\nalmost like I stepped up to take part in those crimes so that Denise didn't have to. And she was able to avoid all that. Other than that one shoplifting stuff. Denise doesn't break the law anymore. She goes off to be a, she's a good parent. She's an angry parent. She's a\ngood parent, she's a teacher. Good citizen overall. I was just the guy that\nkept right on going with it. - Kept on going. So let\nme ask you about that. So your life of cyber crime. (Brett laughs) In describing some of the things you did or knew about you said quote, \"I once stole several\nthousand dollars worth of coins from a family trying to sell them to put a new roof on their home. Another time I sent a\ncounterfeit cashier's check to a victim and he ended\nup being arrested for it. I lied to family,\nfriends, everyone I knew. I was a truly despicable person.\" - [Brett] True. - One of my Ukrainian\nassociates Script had someone who owed him money,\nkidnapped and tortured. He posted pictures of it online. Another member, Iceman, used to flood his enemies email\naddresses with child pornography, then called the police on them.\" That's some stories. Can you tell some of these\nstories that stand out to you that are particularly\ndespicable or representative or interesting?\n- Sure. - When you look back at\nthat defined your approach and who you were at that time? - Let me say that I did\nnot care about my victim. All right? I cared about\nme is what I cared about. It's rough to admit that you know, that you don't give a\nshit what you're doing to anybody else, you only care about you. But that's the truth of the matter. I didn't care about the victims. The lady that that wasn't\neven at the beginning of my career as a cyber criminal. That was right at the last of it.\n- Which lady? - The coin lady. I was by that point ShadowCrew\nhad made the front cover of Forbes August of\n'04, October 26th of '04 Secret Service had to shut us down. 33 people arrested six\ncountries in six hours. I was the guy that was publicly\nmentioned as getting away. What happened was, is I\nwas the guy, I had kind of invented this crime called\ntax return identity theft, and was stealing a lot of money. I went through all my stateside savings and ShadowCrew gets shut down. I don't have any way to\ncome in with any money. So I start running\ncounterfeit cashier's checks. Defrauding people with that,\nhaving them send products or bull and collections, what have you by COD collect on delivery. And I would pay with it with\na counterfeit cashier's check. This lady was on eBay. She had been collecting these\nsilver coins all of her life. The US currency used to be\nthe coins used to be silver. So she had a whole\ncollection of these things like, I don't know, 80,\n90 pounds of this stuff. And I'm a very good social engineer. So convinced her that I\nwas a legitimate person that send it to COD, you\ncan use my FedEx account to do that or my UPS account to do that. I'll pay with a cashier's\ncheck. You can take it in. Same as cash. She believed that she was even on the ad and we talked on the\nphone and everything else. She had told me that\nshe was a single parent and it was the only money that she had to put a roof on the house\nfor her and her kids. And I didn't give a damn,\nI didn't give a damn. What was more important\nwas me at that point. - Can I ask you a question\nabout the social engineering? So maybe specifics like\nthe methodology email, you said phone. Maybe you could discuss this process from a bigger philosophical perspective of what is it about human\nbeings that makes impossible to be social engineered,\nto be victims of fraud? - So first lemme say that, that I became a social\nengineer as a child. Alright? Because the adults\n(chuckles) in my environment as a child, I had to know\nexactly what they were thinking and be able to try to\nmanipulate that for survival. So I became a social engineer\nfor survival, initially. All right? And one of the things\nthat I've seen with a lot of cyber criminals is\nthe exact same thing. The really expert ones. They become a social engineer as a child. Then later on they use those tools to victimize others. Alright? - Which is fascinating because in order to understand what others\nare thinking, you have to be extremely good at empathy. So you have to like really\nput yourself in the shoes of the other person.\n- Absolutely. - And yet in order to\ndo cyber crime, you have to not care about the pain that might cause them\nonce you manipulate them. So you have to empathize and yet not care. - Exactly. And I would argue, I would argue that that is not a sociopath because a cyber criminal\nand I was no different. Most cyber criminals\njustify those actions. So the justification\nbecomes what's important. With me the justification\nwas, well I did it for my family, did it\nfor my wife, did it for my stripper girlfriend.\n- Yeah. - So, and I believe those-\n- That's good story. I heard that one that 'cause I care about love a lot.\n- Yeah. So the big picture of that is trust. How do you establish trust\nwith a potential victim? Alright? Now I would argue online that that trust is established\nthrough a combination of technology tools, social engineering.\n- Yeah. - Alright. So we trust our tech. You know, we trust our cell\nphones, we trust our laptops. A lot of times we don't\nunderstand how they operate, but we trust the news that\ncomes across the line. We trust the phone numbers that show up. We trust IP addresses. If we're advanced enough\nto look at an IP address where a domain or anything else like that. Criminals use tools to manipulate\nthat spoof phone numbers, spoof browser, fingerprints,\nwhatever that may be, whatever the tool may be, then that lays a base level of trust. At that point you shoot in\nwith a social engineering and lay whatever story that is. In order to manipulate that\nvictim to act not out of reason but out of emotion, all of a sudden. - This is fascinating about\nthe way humans interact with the world, which is\nyou're almost too afraid to not trust the world. You have to find a balance.\n- Right? - You have a lot of sort of conspiracy theories now\nabout distrusting institutions and thinking like everything around us. It's like I've been listening to people who believe the earth is flat. And you know, that conspiracy\ntheory is fascinating to me because it basically says that you can't trust anybody.\n- Right? - That like everything you hear is a lie. So you can live that life\nor you can live a life where you're just naively\ntrusting everything. 'Cause that life is kind\nof full of happiness if nobody screws you over.\n- Right? - Because you, you know, you meet people with the joyful heart and you get excited and all that kind of stuff. But if you do that too much,\nyou're gonna get burned. So you have to find some\nkind of balance in terms of optimizing happiness where\nyou trust, I mean, but verify. And on the internet that\nmay becomes really tricky. You're almost too afraid\nto distrust everything 'cause you'll never get anything done. on the internet.\n- Right. - But then if you trust too\nmuch, you can get screwed over. And so the social engineering\ncomes in where you're like, yeah, I'm not sure\nif I should trust this. You kind of help them\nbuild the narrative was like, it's good, it's good. - So, and a lot of the times that social engineering is just feeding into what the victim wants to believe.\n- Yeah. - All right? It's not really coming up\nwith a brand new story at all. It's just knowing what the motivations of that victim is feeding\ninto it at that point. So you have to again,\nthat social engineer has to almost immediately know what's driving that person that they're talking about. So if I'm working on a phone, talking to someone over the phone, I have to know within seconds what I need\nto say, how I need to act to interact with that\ncustomer service agent or whoever I'm talking to on\nthe other end of the line. - So fascinating because\nyou truly are empathizing with the other person.\n- Absolutely. - What is it? This businessman Steven\nSchwartzman I've talked to a few times. He mentioned this thing that, the way you build deep relationships is you really kind of notice the things that people are telling you. Like, like what what they want\nand what they're bothered by. What are their big\nproblems in their lives. 'Cause everybody's\nsaying that all the time and most of us are just ignoring it. - Right, but if you take the time to listen.\n- Yeah. - You know, somebody at that point. - Yeah. - Absolutely you do. Then you have to be able\nto dismiss it. (laughs) - [Lex] Dismiss it after. - You're looking for that just\nto see how I can manipulate that is what you're trying to do. So that the lady was one story. The another truly despicable story. We'll get to Script in a second.\n- Yeah. - But another truly\ndespicable story we were one of the really first groups\nthat started phishing attacks. - [Lex] What's phishing? - So that is a social engineering attack.\n- PH by the way. - Yeah, PH that's another\nsocial engineering attack that's sending that fake\nemail out that looks like it's coming from a website or your financial organization or whatever and saying, Hey, we've\ngot a security problem. We need you to update\nyour account information. Well back then, no one had\never seen a phishing attack. So you could ask for all the\ninformation you were getting just complete identity\nprofiles on a phishing email. Nowadays you can't do that. Nowadays you look for\nbasically credentials because everyone is aware of phishing. But back then it was complete information. We had phished out, I don't know, 200,000 E-Trade accounts is what we had. The login credentials for the-\n- Login password, yeah. - Login password complete, you\nknow, social date of birth, mother's maiden account\ninformation, everything else. So we had access to\nthose E-Trade accounts. E-Trade initially had\nno security in place. So you could cash out the\naccount ACH the money out to whoever to whatever account you wanted to went through just fine. Ate 'em alive on that\nfor four to six months. E-Trade got to the point where you couldn't do any ACH coming out. You know, they locked everything down. Well you're still sitting on\nthousands of E-Trade accounts. How do you make money on that? - Hmm, that's a good question. - Yeah, so what you do\nis you find some fat cat that's got his retirement, you\nknow, invested in blue chips. Same time you find a penny stock, you open up a brand new account,\nbuy into that penny stock, cash the fat cat out, buy\ninto that same penny stock pump a dump schemes all of a sudden.\n- Wow. - So you're destroying\npeople's retirement accounts for just a few thousand dollars. Bam, bam, bam.\n- Wow. - And of course E-Trade\nresponse is not our problem. It's your problem, you shouldn't\nhave give up your password or what have you at that point. And you still see that\nissue today with Zelle scams and things like that. - Which scam? - [Brett] Zelle. So, you know,\nthe instant payment that- - Oh, so it's the same kind of operations with different payment mechanisms. - You find an easy way\nto exploit a system. And typically, the financial\norganization not our problem. Our system's secure. It's the\nhumans, it's their errors. Well, not really. You've got some culpability in that and you're just trying\nto avoid paying the part of the bill is what's going on. - One of the things just to stand phishing for a bit is it really makes me sad 'cause there's been people\non all kinds of platforms, like including YouTube\ncomments, but emails too. They figured out emails somehow. So people are now seeing the followers of this particular podcast or fans, they're finding them on platforms\nlike LinkedIn and YouTube and so on, and they are\nfiguring out ways to get to those people by another channel.\n- Right? Which I suppose seems more authentic to those people.\n- Right. - So they send them an email\nfrom what looks like me and with this like loving me. The interesting thing, the emails sound like something I would write. At this stage, it doesn't feel automated or if it's automated,\nthere's a human in the loop that's really fine tuning, to specific or maybe I'm very predictable, but it's very loving in the\nway I would write a message. (laughs) - And so think about that. All right. So when phishing first comes out, you could look at the language\nof the text or the website and say, eh, if you were\npaying attention that that's so, okay, so that's not an English speaker\nwho wrote that typically. Alright. But as time has went on as the awareness of what a phishing attack\nlooks like, we have people that are sitting down now and making sure that the language is proper. It gets worse than that though. If you look at business email compromise. Alright, so the way a business\nemail compromise typically works is the attacker will\nfind a payroll person, find a CEO, he will fashion\na spear phishing email, which is, that's a phishing attack that's targeting one\nspecific individual, alright? So he'll fashion a spear phishing email. And the way he does that is\nhe pulls all the information he possibly can on that\nperson or that CEO. Maybe he'll spear that CEO just to get their login credentials to their email just to read the emails. And he'll go in there and he'll start reading all these emails. He'll specifically read the emails to the payroll department,\nsee what that relationship is. Are they talking about\ntheir kids, talking about relationships, talking about vacation? What are they talking\nabout? How are they talking? Are they friendly? Are they\nsterile? What are they doing? Alright, so then he decides,\nwell I'm gonna go ahead and spear phish this,\nthe payroll department as well.\n- This is good. - So then he spear phishes\nthem, gets those credentials. At the same time he\ncreates a Unicode domain in whatever the company name is. All right? So instead of that English\nalphabet, I, he's got that Russian letter that looks like an I but without the dot on top.\n- Yeah. - All right, comes back into the email, into the payroll email blocks\nthe real CEO's email, replaces that with the unicode email that he's got. And then sends out a message\nusing the correct language, the correct relationships,\neverything else, and says Hey, you know, we're\nupdating our account status. I need you to send this payment instead of the over here, they've\nset up a new account, send all payments over here now. And that is business emo\ncompromise in a nutshell. Alright? Works great. - Probably the larger\norganization, the more susceptible to that kind of attack. 'Cause there's a like a\ndistribution responsibility to where you're more likely to believe that okay, this other\nperson is responsible. I'm sure they secured everything.\n- Absolutely. - I'm okay listening to this.\n- All right. So that's business email\ncompromise and it those crimes. And that's one of the things\nyou see about cyber crime. Cyber crime is not really sophisticated. It's not, the attacks\nare not sophisticated. The stat is 90% of every single\nattack uses a known exploit. It's not zero day attacks.\n- Yeah. - They're out there. But if you're a criminal\nwaiting on a zero day to profit, you're gonna starve to death. The meat and potatoes are\nat 90% known exploits. - Well you're saying it's\nmaybe, you mean it's not technically sophisticated.\n- Right. - But it's social\nengineering sophisticated. - [Brett] Very sophisticated on that end. Very sophisticated. - I mean it's a fascinating\nstudy of human psychology. - That establishment of trust and then using that trust\nto defraud that victim, that is something. - Obviously all of these folks\nare really good at hiding. I wish you could tell their stories in a way, which is why you're\nfascinating is you're able to tell these stories now, 'cause it is studying human\nnature by exploiting it. But you get to understand like\nour weak points, our hope, our desire to trust others\nalso sort of the weak points and the failures of digital systems and at scale humans have to connect.\n- Right. - It's fascinating. This is a weird question\nasking for a friend (chuckles) is spear phishing itself illegal? What's the legality here? - Oh, it's all illegal. Absolutely, it is. - Absolutely. So here's what, okay, let me,\nlemme construct an example. So if my friend were to spear\nphish like a CEO, right? And get their information. And after they get control,\nsay of their Twitter account, they tweet something loving\nand positive, what's the crime? - [Brett] Unauthorized access, I'd advice. - What would be the\npunishment, do you think? - That becomes questionable. So no monetary loss or\nwas there a monetary loss? - [Lex] Probably not. - All right, so you have to\nfigure out who the victim is before charges are pressed. Now the crime would be\nunauthorized access. All right? But no real victim on that unless, you know, the person\nwhose account you took over takes, you know, exception to that. No monetary loss. - But there's not really\nstandard like fines. - [Brett] Probably nothing's gonna happen. - Right, right, right. So, I mean, that's kind of interesting. 'Cause it's, (chuckles) so\nwhen I got the ransomware, when I got the zero day\nattack on the QNAP, you know, they basically say the\ncriminal is QNAP the company for having so many\nsecurity vulnerabilities. You are the victim of QNAPs incompetence. That's the way they kind of phrase it. - I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that at all. So, SolarWinds. (both laughing) - [Lex] Yeah. So I've got 130 page class\naction lawsuit printed out at the house. I've been going through it, that catalogs how SolarWinds lied for years about their vulnerabilities, and they lied to investors. The people who came out, the\nauditors who they would hire would, you know, they would\nnot pay attention to them when they said, you know,\nyou've got these issues. They would say, go away,\nshit like that for years until SolarWinds, you know,\nthe attacks become apparent. My view on that is that\nthe only person responsible for the crime are the\ncriminals who did the attacking the actual criminals. Not, not SolarWinds. Now does that mean the\nSolarWinds isn't fucked up? They are, and there needs to\nbe some accounting (laughs) in place, but the only individual, the only people responsible\nfor crime are the criminals. And that's either online, in the physical world, what have you. Being an idiot is not a crime.\n- A crime. (both laughing) - Being criminally negligent is. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I think that SolarWinds\nis certainly responsible. Not responsible, they're\nculpable for what happened. - Can you actually tell\nfolks about SolarWinds? What are some interesting\nthings that you're aware of? - Yeah, SolarWinds was very... It provided a backbone of security for hundreds, thousands\nof different companies. If you looked at a lot of security companies\nwere using SolarWinds that would allow you to get a snapshot of the entire system that\nthey were working on. So what happens is you get a\nRussian group that comes in and they basically, they\nhack into SolarWinds and they get access to it. And it allows them to\nview every single thing. I mean, every single thing\nabout every single client that SolarWinds had at that point. So, entire snapshots of all\nthe IP that was going on, all the emails, all the\ncommunications, every single secret that was going on with those companies, if a company had software like\nMicrosoft, it allowed them to look at the source code of\neverything that was going on. I mean, it was just a complete\nand total nightmare. Alright? And something that you are\nnot going to recover from. You're not, I mean,\nit's done at that point. You know, there's not been a\nlot of news lately about it, but the fact of the matter is,\nis that's the type of attack, that's a catastrophic attack. - So there's a huge amount of information that was read saved elsewhere, probably.\n- Oh, yeah. - And so now there's people\nsitting on information. - Absolutely. So think about one of the\nattack vectors has been Microsoft Outlook 365, things like that. This allowed the attackers to look at the source codes of that. So they have the source code now. So they go through it line by line, what are the vulnerabilities? Let's find new\nvulnerabilities, new zero days. You know, I said zero days aren't common, but this opens up an entire new threat surface all of a sudden. So it's a completely catastrophic attack. Once all the chips are down,\neverything's tallied up, people are gonna be like, yeah, we're done.\n- Yeah. (laughs) All right, this whole\ncomputer thing, we're tried it and we're walking away.\n- We're done. (laughs) So that's terrifying\nbecause, so you're saying that there's not been obvious\nbig negative impact from that yet, so, but like. - I mean, there's been a\nlot of negative impact, but we're just starting, - Right?\n- We're staring. - So the capacity for\ndestruction is huge here. How much involvement from nation states do you\nthink there is on this? - You know, it's interesting. So you've got Iran, you've\ngot North Korea, China, Russia, you got the big four, you also got Brazil.\n- Yeah. - You've got all these other countries that are interested in\nthe United States as well. Nation states are interesting depending on who the nation state is. Alright, so Russia's\nvery good about working with the type of criminal\nthat I used to be. You know, they'll enlist these guys and steal information or what have you. Then Russia will take the\ninformation they want to, and they'll basically go off and sell whatever you want\nto and make some money. China's all about IP, North\nKorea's about stealing money because they really don't know what the hell else to do right now. - So North Korea is actively\ninvolved in cyber crime? - Absolutely. They've stolen a shit load\nof Bitcoin, everything else. So absolutely they're\nactively involved with that. Very, very skilled\nattackers. Very skilled. But even if you look at, I\ntold you that stat about 90%. Alright, so even though SolarWinds is gonna be the number one\nattack, the follow up to that is this not petty\nattack that happened. And so that was the most\nsophisticated attack launched by the Russian Sand Worm group using all known exploits throughout. So again, it's not, you're right. And the sophistication is typically not technical sophistication, but it's that social\nengineering sophistication. How do you get these things put together in line to attack and succeed? - But when you get access\nto the source code, that's where technical\nsophistication could really do a lot of damage. Oh yeah. And that's when you find out real quick, that's what separates the men\nfrom the boys in this game. Alright? Because all of a sudden\nit's not, I don't have to worry about social\nengineering, I've got source codes and I've got professionals\nthat are looking at that. And that's your ass. - Which then enables probably even more powerful social\nengineering methods too. I mean, it's just right cascade of, is this terrifying to you by the way? This, that this world that\nwe're living in, as we put more and more of ourselves on the\ninternet into the metaverse, that there is so many more\nattack vectors on our wellbeing. - What's terrifying to me, I used to preach it on ShadowCrew, is the idea that the perception of\ntruth is more important than the truth itself. It doesn't matter what the facts are, it matters what I can convince you of. - [Lex] Yeah. - That's what's terrifying to me. So you look at deep fakes, you look at fake news, all this stuff that's going out that\nbecomes truly terrifying. - Maybe there's an\nangle where it's freeing if nothing is true and\nyou can't trust anything. (Brett laughs) - But you see, we as human\nbeings, we want to trust. We do, we need human interaction. And for that human interaction, you have to have a degree of trust. - But it's more like you let\ngo of an idea of absolute truth and it more becomes like a\nblockchain style consensus. So you let go of like, you know what? There's this human dream. You know, you get this on the\ninternet, you get like facts as if there's at the\nbottom, there's one turtle that's holding this like scroll that says, these are\nthe truths of the world. The problem is, I mean, maybe believing that is counterproductive,\nmaybe human civilization is an ongoing process of consensus. And so it's always going to\nbe, everything is shrouded and you can call them lies or\nyou can call them inaccuracies or you can call them delusions. It's constantly going to be, it's going to be a sea of lies and delusions. But our hope is to over\ntime, develop bigger and bigger islands of\nconsensus that allows us to live a stable and happy society. Don't call it true, call\nit a stable consensus that creates a high quality of life for the habitants of the island. (Brett laughs) - I like it. I mean, I like it. I mean, that's where we're\ngoing to agree on this. - And then don't use Outlook.\nNo, I'm just kidding. So maybe a step back,\nyou mentioned I'd love to talk about ShadowCrew. Maybe this is the right\ntime to actually... - Yeah, let's go to ShadowCrew. It's such a fascinating story. So tell me the story of building\nShadowCrew the precursor to today's darknet and darknet markets. You're, this is why you're\nthe original Godfather. - This is it. - [Lex] This is it. - So I get married. I faked a car accident to get married. Got the money from that. - [Lex] You're romantic. - I'm romantic like my dad, man. I'm the guy that, you know, I get from mom, I get the criminal mindset. From dad. I get that.\nDon't want him to leave. (laughs) - So you get married. - [Brett] I met this girl. - What's that story? - [Brett] Oh dude, I was- - How did you fall in love there? My first girlfriend was\na preacher's daughter and crazy over her. Dated her for five years. And she figured out pretty quickly that, well, not quickly,\nit took her five years to figure out that Brett\nJohnson is not the man of God. (laughs) I could talk it, but more\nthat agnostic than anything. She breaks up with me. So I\nwas at the community college. - You'd make one hell\nof a preacher by the- - [Brett] Thanks. (both laughing) Yeah. - So I've got that\nLangston Hughes problem, I'm looking for Jesus to\nshow up and he just doesn't. (both laughing) So I was at the community college and I was a straight asshole. I was arrogant, conceited everything else. And I had posted an advertisement on one of the billboards looking\nfor an adult babysitter, hot blonde, you know, come\nvisit me in the library. Buddy of mine shows up\nand he is like, \"Brett.\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"The hottest girl\nin school right down the hall.\" And I was like, \"Serious?\"\nHe's like, \"Yeah\". And I was like, \"Let's go see.\" (laughs) Walk over and there's these two guys that are hitting on her. So I just walk up and me\nand Todd, that was my buddy, walk up and I'm just\nsitting there and listening and they're, you know,\nthey're giving the spiel and everything and she's\njust kind of taking it in. Finally I looked over and I was like, \"You wanna get outta here?\" And one of the guys looks\nat (laughs) me, he's like, \"Hey, we're talking to her.\" And I was like, \"Well,\nyou're talking at her. You're not talking to her. I'm about to save her ass from you.\" - [Lex] Yeah. This is a smooth\npickup line, by the way. If I ever hear one, that's good. You wanna get outta here? - So start dating and she was the girl that screwed my brains out man. And I fell, I head over hills. We got married six\nmonths later. Six months. - [Lex] That's what love does. - That's what it does. And she didn't know I was a crook. She had no idea. You know,\nshe knew I was very bright. She knew I did a lot of\ntheater stuff like that. Got a job at, I was in Hazard.\nThere was no jobs to be had. So I got a job in Lexington 'cause we were gonna be moving to UK. Got a job in Lexington at\nLexmark, testing printer boards, circuit boards. So I would leave on a Thursday night, work three 18 hour shifts at\nLexmark, come back home on on Monday, got married,\nfaked a car accident to get that the rest of the money\nthat I needed to get married. And the faking on that man,\nI had bought a Chevy Spectrum at a car auction, gave\nlike 500 bucks for it. My aunt had previously\ndefrauded USAA insurance on a car accident. And she was telling me all about it. She's like, look, go down\nto this chiropractor. Make sure you get the\ninsurance where they'll pay for a rental car. They'll pay lost wages. I was\nlike, they pay lost wages. She's like, \"Yeah, they pay\nlost wages.\" I was like, \"Hmm.\" She's like, \"By the way, you work for me.\" And I was like, \"I work for you.\" - And you get to define\nthe wage and you can also define how long\nyou were unable to work. - Exactly. Exactly. And the chiropractor will\nsign off on any damn thing. Alright. So my cousin Ronnie, he\nfigures out that I'm going, he finds out I'm gonna\nfake this car accident. So he comes to him, he's like, \"Hey man, can I get in on that?\" I was like, \"Yeah, man,\nyou get in on that.\" So this kid, he's five days\nyounger than I am. This kid. He goes to the dentist\nthe day that we're faking. It has a tooth pulled, tells\nthe dentist not to numb it, not to stitch it, just pull it. So he shows up, he shows up the day that we're driving out\nto fake the accident. He is got blood all over his shirt. He is still bleeding outta\nthe mouth and everything else. I'm like, \"Are you okay?\" And he is like, \"Yeah\nman, it's gonna be good. It's gonna be good.\" I'm like, \"Okay.\" So my mom by this point, I'm\nliving with my grandparents. My mom is up in the head of a hollow. So we're like, \"We'll just do it up there. We'll go act like we're visiting my mom on the way back out, ran over a mountain.\" I was like, \"okay.\" So we go visit and everything,\ncome back out that night, run over the side of the hill,\nme and Ronnie walk back up, of course it totals the car. Walk back to my mom's\nacting like we've wrecked. She knows what time it\nis and everything else. And file the claims. So that gets the money to, to get married. And me and my wife move\nfrom Hazard to Lexington. And I'm the kid that my crime, usually, if I was a single guy,\nwouldn't break the law, wouldn't I would be all right. You know? But females involved, oh yeah, oh yeah, I gotta spend the money,\ngotta show 'em gifts. Everything else was never enough to show love in some sort of healthy way. Always had to go overboard. And typically it was buying some or stealing some sort of expensive frat. - So that was the thing. That was the way you show love\nis by buying expensive gifts. - Right? Or something overboard. Back then with Susan,\ninitially it was don't worry about working, I got it. You just worry about going to\nschool. She was a music major. I was like, \"You just worry\nabout going to school, so don't worry about\ncooking and cleaning.\" I got it, I got it. So not only was this guy\nthat was going overboard, but I was kind of a\ncontrol freak too, right? So, no, I got it, I got it, I got it. So here I am, you know, 60 hour week job, 18 hour class load cooking and cleaning. Something had to give. I quit the job. I couldn't do it. Quit the job and start back in fraud and trying to hide that\nfrom her at the same time. So it was initially telemarketing fraud. Started, I was working at,\nthe first job I had was a telemarketer at a cemetery\nselling grave sites. And then that ended, went over to work for the Shriners Circus,\nShriners Hospital. And there was a third party company that was doing all the telemarketing. Made really good money doing that. That job ended and then\nthey pivoted over to working with Kiwanis Clubs, selling food baskets to the food banks and everything. So I stole the phone list and started at my own Kiwanis Club and would do the telemarketing,\ngo out twice a week and pick up checks. Well, what happened was is I'm\ngoing out picking up checks, go knock on a door. Turns out one of the persons that I had called was a\nlaw enforcement officer. So he was like, \"Who are you?\" (laughs) I'm like, \"I'm with the Kiwanis Club.\" And he is like, \"No, you're not.\" (laughs) So got arrested, spent three\nmonths in a county jail for theft by deception,\ngot out and we had to move from Lexington back to Hazard and live with Susan's parents. They had gotten a desktop computer. HP and I started surfing\naround online, found eBay, and didn't really know\nhow to make money on eBay. About the same time I'm committing\nlow level frauds online. I don't really talk\nabout that in the past, the first time I've\nreally talked about that. But I would pay for it with bad checks. - So not using a platform like eBay more? - I would find somebody that\nhad like a stereo system on eBay, something like that. And I'd pay for it with a bad check and would rely on them not to chase me or because they were outta\nstate at that point. And the dollar amounts were very low. So got the money to move to\nfinally did those schemes enough to get the money to\nmove back to Lexington. Got to Lexington. And by this point, I'm, I'm\ndoing these, like I said, these schemes on eBay and I'm like, there's gotta be a better\nway to make money on eBay. Gotta be. So, didn't really know how. One night I'm watching Inside\nEdition with Bill O'Reilly and they're profiling Beanie Babies. So I'm sitting there watching\nand the one they're profiling is this one called Peanut: The\nRoyal Blue Elephant selling for $1,500 on eBay. I'm sitting there going like, shit I need to find me a peanut. (laughs) So my initial thought was, well\nthere's gotta be one in one of these Hallmark stores\nin Kentucky someplace. So I skipped class the next day, went out around all the Hallmark stores looking for peanut, no idiot,\nhe's on eBay for $1,500. So after a few hours of\nthat, I'm like, \"Hmm.\" Turns out they had little gray\nBeanie Baby Elephants for $8. Picked up one of those for $8, stopped by Kroger on the way\nhome, picked up a pack of blue Rit dye, went home,\ntried to dye the little guy. So that was a nightmare. Turns out they're made out\nof polyester, got 'em out of the bath, look like\nthey've got the mange. And what happens is, I'm\ntrying to die the thing. And I'm like, well that's not gonna work. That's just not gonna work. So\nI got online, found a picture of a real one, posted it\non eBay, and I was like, well, what I can do is I can claim that's the one I've got. And then maybe claim that it got messed up in the mail and work out like that. So, posted a picture of a real one online, woman thought I had the real thing. She wins the bid that\nsocial engineering kicks in immediately. I didn't want to, I didn't\nwanna be on the defensive. I wanted to put her on the defensive. So as soon as she wins the\nbid, I send her a message, Hey, we've not done any business before. I don't even know if I can trust you. What I need you to do protects us both. Go down the US Postal\nService, get two money orders, totaling $1,500, send them to me, issued by the US government. That way we're both protected. Soon as I get the money orders,\nI'll send you your animal. She believed that, didn't\nask any questions at all. She believed that, sent\nme the money orders, I cashed 'em out, sent her the creature, immediately got a phone\ncall, \"I didn't order this.\" My response, \"Lady, you\nordered a blue elephant. I sent you a blueish elephant.\" And she got pissed and she kept calling. What I found out, and that's\nreally the first lesson of cyber crime that\nmost of these criminals, including self learns, if you\ndelay a victim long enough, just keep putting 'em off. A lot of them, they get\nexasperated, throw their hands in the air, walk away,\nyou don't hear from 'em. And none of them to this\nday, none of them complained to law enforcement, they eat it. - It's a mixture of like,\nyou're exhausted by the process. So it's just easier to walk away and second, almost like an embarrassment. - So there's a whole slew of reasons. Alright, there's exhaustion. Certainly there's the embarrassment. So if you figure out, if you look at it today, where does the\nembarrassment come from? Well, the media family members\nwe're all very good about blaming the victim for crimes. Why would you click on the link? Why would you send money to somebody you don't\nknow, blah, blah, blah. So you've got, that's going on. You've got the issue of\nwho do you complain to? Back then, you didn't know, do\nyou complain to local police because she's in another state. So which local police do you complain to? Do you complain to the feds? Well, it's not, the dollar\namounts aren't high enough to complain to feds. Feds are gonna tell you to go local. Local's gonna tell you, Hey,\nit happened in Kentucky. Complain to them. Kentucky's gonna tell you,\nwell, shit, you're over there. We need you to come in. So there's this whole\nissue, the jurisdiction of the blame factor, everything else. So I got away with that crime\nand under my own name at that point, kept going\nand got better at it. Started to understand how to hide identities, things like that. Started selling pirated software. Pirated software led into\ninstalling mod chips. It was for the initial pirated software was Sega Saturn, PlayStation one. Well you had a have a mod chip in those to play the pirate to discs. So I started selling\nand installing mod chips that led into installing mod chips into cable television boxes. So you could watch all the pay-per-view, which in turn led into\nprogramming satellite DSS cards, those at HRCA satellite\nsystems pull the card out of it, program it, turns\non all the channels. Started doing that. - Can we just pause That\nis very entrepreneurial. So just technically, so\nthere's laws and rules that you're breaking nonstop. So there's also legitimate\nways of doing that, which is break the rules of\nthe conventions of the past. That's the first principles thing. That's what Elon Musk and his ilk do all the time.\n- Right? - That is guts and brilliance. But when it's crossing\nthe lines of the law, actually sometimes the law is outdated. The thing is, as a human being have to then compute the ethical\ndamage you're doing, like ethically, the damage you're doing about other human beings. That is fundamentally the thing that you're breaking is you're adding to the suffering in the\nworld in way another. And you're justifying it. But in terms of me,\nsort of as an engineer, that is some gutsy thinking. That's how Was and Steve Jobs thought. - [Brett] Sure. - That's innovation. And maybe just think your, if you can introspect your\nthinking process here. This is a new, I like how\nyou remember this in HP, like this is a totally new thing to you. Computers is yet another domain. How are you figuring these puzzles out? Presumably mostly alone.\n- Alone. - When you were thinking through these problems-\n- Alone. - Is this is a strange question to ask, but you know, what is\nyour thinking process? What is your approach to\nsolving these problems? So the approach is, you do\nsomething and you fuck it up and you think back, okay,\nhow do I fix that? (laughs) So you fix that aspect,\nyou commit the crime again, and it goes a little bit further and it screws up, okay, how do I fix that? What's the issue on\nthat? How do I fix that? - So there's not a deep\ndesign thinking, like- - Later on it becomes that. Once you lay that groundwork of the way these schemes are working, all right, it becomes that. And you can apply that to other things in cyber crime as a whole. Alright? But initially it's,\nit's basically trial and error. You've got a problem. How\ndo you solve that problem? Alright, so I'm committing\nthese crimes under my name. How do I solve that? Well, one of the first principles\nthat we started to teach on ShadowCrew is all crimes should begin with identity theft. That's one of the main first\nprinciples that a lot of people to this day still don't really get. Alright, why would I commit\na crime under my name if I can do it under your name? So that's one of the big buffers. And that takes trial and error to get to that point where you start to understand that's the way crime should\noperate if you're a criminal. Alright? But with me, I mean it's trial and error. It's that childhood where that mindset is kind of ingrained in you. Where you're looking for ways, let's say non-traditional ways of getting around things\nor getting through things. - I mean, one of the questions\nI'll probably ask this later is, there's also a unique\naspect to the outcome of what you were doing, which\nis you didn't get caught for a very long time.\n- Right. - We'll talk about why that is. And the thing is, it's so interesting, all crime probably to be\neffective should start with identity theft.\n- Right. - I like that identity theft. 'Cause identity theft\ncan take so many forms, right?\n- Right. - So yes, so ShadowCrew. So you started with love. (laughs) - Started with love. (laughs) So now we're, you know,\ndoing these schemes online. I'm selling to these, I'm programming these satellite DSS cards. And you, one of the interesting things, and you still see that to this\nday, is something will happen that will create an\nindustry for criminals. All right, so what happened is Canadian judge rules about the same time that I'm doing these satellite cards. Canadian judge comes out\nand says, \"Hey, it's legal for my citizens to pirate those signals.\" And his reasoning is since\nRCA doesn't sell the systems up here, my citizens can pirate it. Okay? So (laughs) what happens\nis overnight about the same time PayPal comes into play. So PayPal's coming right\nonline at about the same time overnight little cottage industry pops up in the United States. You go down to Best Buy, buy the system for a hundred dollars, take it out in the parking lot,\nopen system up, pull it, open the box up, pull the\nsystem out, pull the card out, throw the system away,\nprogram the card, ship its to Canada, $500 a pop. Started doing that business\nis good making, you know, three, $4,000 a week doing that. I'm like, yeah, that's good. I have so many orders, I\ncan't fill all the orders. And quickly think to myself, why do I need to fill any of them? They're in Canada, I'm down here. (laughs) You know, who are they gonna complain to? Because I already found out\npeople don't complain. Alright? They're not gonna complain to anybody. So I start-\n- Especially in Canada. - Especially in Canada, and\nI'm having 'em send money. That's when PayPal's first into play and it amazes me that\neverybody is using PayPal. It's like you don't\neven have to really ask. They're like, \"Can we PayPal?\" \"Yeah, you can pay all\nday long by PayPal.\" And PayPal had no clue what\nthey were doing with security. So it's like, okay, so they're\nsending money to PayPal. I'm having the PayPal\ncashed out to bank accounts in my name at that point. And I get scared because\nby that point I'm stealing in four to $6,000 a week. And I'm like, somebody's gonna be looking at money laundering. So getting into my head,\nI'm like, best thing that I can do is get a\nfake driver's license, open up a bank account using that driver's license,\ncash out at the ATM. Good. No idea where to\nget a fake ID, not a clue. So I get online, looked around,\nspent a couple weeks looking around, thought I found a guy. He went by the screen\nnamed of Fake ID Man. Thought I found a guy. Sent him $200, sent him my\npicture, dude rips me off. (both laughing) I'm like what the hell? (laughs) - Got played. - Oh, I got played. He had a little, a website\nset up with reviews and I'm like, \"Oh, it's all legitimate.\" Yeah, he's building that\ntrust that I talked about. So the end result, I got pissed and there was no site that dealt with anything criminal\nor cyber crime related. The only real avenue you had was an IRC chat session, internet relay chat. And that, I'm sure you've been on that this, it rolling chat board. You don't know who the\nhell you're talking to. Most of 'em are full of shit.\nYou can't trust anybody. And you're sitting there\ntrying to conduct business. So you know, if somebody\nclaims they've got a product or service, do they have it? Does it work? Are they\njust gonna rip you off? Because in those channels,\neveryone, it's a criminal. I kept looking around and I happened upon a website\ncalled Counterfeit Library. And Counterfeit Library only\ndealt with counterfeit degrees and certificates as only\ndegree mill type stuff. But they had a forum and\nno one was using the forum. So I basically get on\nthere and bitch every day. I got ripped off, don't know what to do. Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. About the same time I start doing that, two other guys show\nup, one's named Mr. X, he's out of Los Angeles. Other guy's named BLS Above, he is out of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. And we all become buddies. So a few weeks of me\nbitching, them responding, BLS Above gets me on ICQ. And he sends me a message,\nhe's like, \"I went by the screen name of GOllum\nat that point, GOllumfun.\" And he's like, \"GOllum, I can make you\na fake driver's license.\" And I was like, \"Well, fuck do it.\" And he is like, \"Well I'm\ngonna charge you for it.\" I'm like, \"Yeah you are.\" And he's like, \"Yeah, I am.\"\nI was like, \"No you're not.\" And he is like, \"Look man.\" He said, \"this business, if\nyou're gonna do this, you have to trust people or you're gonna fail.\" He said, \"so I'm gonna charge you $200 but I'm gonna send you\na driver's license.\" Well by this point I'm friends with the people who own\nCounterfeit Library. We're emailing chat and everything else and I tell him, I'm like,\n\"Okay, I'm gonna send you $200 that way when you rip me\noff, I'll have them ban you and I don't have to\ndeal with you anymore.\" And he is like, \"Bet.\" I'm like, \"Okay.\" So I sent him $200, sent him my picture. Two weeks later I get a driver's license name was\nSteven Schwake out of Ohio. And real guy worked at a DP\npayroll to this day, works at ADP is where the guy works,\ngot the driver's license. And to me, at that point in\ntime, it was the prettiest thing that I'd ever seen. You know, I'd never seen a fake ID before. I thought it was great. Turns out, you know, looking\nback it was like, eh, so, (laughs) but- - Is kind of a strong first step in creating a fake identity. - [Brett] Very strong. Very strong. So this, so that was like- - Can I ask you, just on the point he made that if you're gonna be successful in this, you should have people you trust. He is he right on that? - [Brett] He's absolutely\nright. He's absolutely. - So you have to have, this is like mob.\n- You have to- - You have to have an inner\ncircle, that you trust. - You know, I'm sure you've probably seen, heard me say this before. Successful cyber crime. Alright? There are three necessities\nto being successful online. If you're a criminal, three\nnecessities are gathering data, committing the crime,\nand then cashing it out. All three of those necessities\nhave to work in conjunction. If they don't, the crime fails. The problem, and it's a huge problem, is that one guy can't do all three things. You've got the people who gather the data. Basically the general store sells. People who sell PII credit\ncard logins, data tools, they always sell the spoofed phone numbers or the RDPs stuff like that. A lot of the times those\npeople don't know how to commit the crime. And those people certainly don't know how to launder the money out\nand put cash in pocket. So you've got either\nbecause of a skill level, sometimes the geographic\nlocation limits what that individual can do. Alright? So you have to rely on people who are good in areas where you are not in order for that crime to succeed. And that means you have\nto trust those people. So what happens with ShadowCrew? Alright, so Counterfeit\nLibrary is the start. Alright? Counterfeit Library\ntransitions over to ShadowCrew. Right before that transition,\nthere's a Ukrainian guy by the name of Dmitry Golubov. He was a spammer at that point in time. He saw what we were doing with Counterfeit Library and he liked it. He was getting all these\ncredit card details and this kid, I mean he is\na kid, this kid has an idea. And his idea was, I wondered if people would buy stolen\ncredit card details. - It's pretty good.\nUkrainian Russian accent. - Thanks. So he picks up the phone,\nhe calls his buddies, they call their buddies. They have a physical conference in Odessa. 150 of these cyber criminals show up. And they launched this idea. This launches a website\ncalled CarderPlanet, which is the genesis of all\nmodern credit card theft as we know it. Alright? And so remember I mentioned\nthose three necessities of cyber crime. Dmitry had all the credit data\nin the world and he partnered with all these other Ukrainians who had all this data as well. The problem was, is so much\nfraud had been committed on that eastern side of Europe that every card had been shut down. Even if you were a legitimate card holder and tried to cash it out,\nyou weren't doing it at that point. So again, those three\nnecessities gathering data, committing crime, cashing out. Dmitry had the data, they\ncould commit the crime, they could not put cash in pocket. So we were running Counterfeit Library. One day I get this\nmessage, or not a message. One day Script shows up and he posts just on the general forum. He posts, Hey, I've got credit card data. Give me an address, gimme\na burner phone number, wait five business days,\norder whatever you want to. We had never seen anything\nthat we were a PayPal fraud and eBay fraud site is what we were and fake driver's licenses. So the, and we had, I guess\nwe had two, 3000 members at that point. So the response from the\nmembers was, that can't be real. You've gotta be law enforcement. It's gotta be in trying to get us arrested and everything else. What, let me backtrack a little bit. So the driver's license that I had, got BLS Above had an idea. What he wanted to do is he\nwanted to sell driver's licenses. Mr X wanted to sell social security cards. He made a very passable\nsocial security card. Me, I had no skill level on that. I knew PayPal fraud and eBay fraud. So BLS was like, tell you\nwhat, you be the reviewer. That way you get every product or service that comes in,\nthey'll have to send it to you or let you have access to it. You can learn the entire game. And because you're not selling anything, it gives you legitimacy on the reviews. Alright, so I start out as a\nreviewer, the only reviewer on Counterfeit Library. So over the next year,\nBLS Above turns out he was a pot grower. He goes back to growing pot 'cause he wasn't making shit\nselling driver's licenses. Mr. X, about a year and a half in he gets arrested, cashing\nout driver's credit card, not credit cards. Cashing out to casinos,\ndoing some with that. So I'm the only guy left standing and I'm at the top of the heap. So, and it becomes this thing where if I review somebody,\nthey make a lot of money. If I don't, you don't do business here. So Script shows up saying he is got this, I'm the only reviewer on site. People think he's law enforcement. First week it goes like that. After a while I'm like,\n\"Okay, I gotta do something.\" And I'm scared man. 'Cause I'm like, he\nmay be law enforcement. So I get him on ICQ and I'm like, \"Hey, you\nhave to be reviewed.\" And he's like, \"What the hell is that?\" So I tell him what it is.\nHe's like, \"You review me.\" And I was like, \"Yeah, that's the idea.\" So give him a drop address,\ngive him a burner phone number. Wait five business days. And\nI try to hit Dell for $5,000. The order fails. I get back on\nICQ, Hey man, it didn't work. He's like, gimme one more chance. I was like, look, I'll\ngive you one more chance, but it's your ass after that. And he's like, \"One more chance.\" I'm like, \"Okay, give him another address, another phone number. Wait another five business days.\" Hit Thompson's computer warehouse for $4,000, Dell for $5,000. Order goes through, get the products in. I post that review on Counterfeit Library and literally overnight we turn from an eBay PayPal fraud\nsite to a credit theft site. And that becomes a lot of money\nreally quickly for members. So we were doing, now it's\ncalled CNP fraud card, not present fraud. So you hit, you use hit an online merchant with stolen credit card data. Back then a fairly experienced\nfraudster could profit 30 to $40,000 a month. Okay? Just buying, you know,\nlaptops, what have you. And cashing out, you know, put 'em on eBay for sale and selling 'em like that. And 30 to 40K a month\nwas the profit on that. Script had a lot of buddies. He had people like Roman\nVega, these other guys that would sell not just credit card data, but counterfeit physical\ncredit cards as well. - Counterfeit not stolen, so counterfeit.\n- Counterfeit. - That must be tough to do. - [Brett] So the connections- - Must be harder than what\nit's driver's license. - Of course. It's crazy. So you know, you're back. So what's what BOA initially had and I became the United\nStates salesperson for BOA. But what he had was is he\nwas the first dumps provider in the United States. So on the back of your credit or debit card, there's a magnetic stripe. Three data tracks on the stripe. There was the first data\ntrack is the customer's name. Second data track is\nthe card number/16 digit algorithm outside of\nthat, that's important. We'll get back to that in a few minutes. Third data track is called\nindiscriminate data. No one uses it. Alright, so what's bought and sold is the second data track. It's called the dump and the reason that's sold is when you go into a shop, you insert the\ncard or you swipe the card. The only information that's sent out for verification is the second data track. Alright? That goes to the\nprocessor bank for verification. The first data track that\ncustomer's name shows up on the screen of the\ncashier in front of you. So what typically happens is\nyou buy 10 of these dumps, you get 10 counterfeit cards in code track two on all 10 cards. Track one, you create one fake\ndriver's license track one is just the name of that\none fake driver's license. That way when you go in the\nshop, swipe the card track two gets sent off a verification track, one shows up on the screen\nin front of the cashier. If you ever ask for ID you pull\nout the fake ID, everyone's an ice swarm fuzzy. You walk out with the cameras Rolex. - And track one could be a, it\ndoesn't have to be connected. It's not connected to track two. - Not connected at all. Alright? That's one of the big problems. Alright?\n- Yeah. - So Script brought a\nhost of technical people into that type of environment. All committing credit card theft. We had proxy providers,\nwe had all these people that were doing this stuff. We start making a lot of money a lot. And the reason that happens is again, Script did not have the\nability to cash out. So he was reduced to selling things and at the same time he's looking for how do I make more money? Alright, the Ukrainians happened upon this thing called the CVV one breach or hack is what it's what they called it. So what happens is, remember I told you of track two card number forward\nslash 16 digit algorithm. You gotta know the algorithm to encode it. So you can swipe the card or\ntake it to the ATM machine. Alright? ATM, you gotta know it. Now we were phishing data from hell. I mean we were doing a\nlot of phishing, a lot. We were getting pins, we\nwere getting card numbers. But you can't get that algorithm. So the Ukrainians start testing stuff. What they found out was no bank had implemented the hash on track two. So you take the card number\nforward slash any 16 digits, it would encode, take it to the ATM, pull cash out\n'cause you got the pin. Alright, started doing that. - Wait, wait, sorry, I'm\ntrying to understand. So that means, so if there's no, are they generating random numbers or do they have valid\nnumbers for track two? - No numbers were needed at all as long as just the track two\nwas a complete track two. - So it's a valid track\ntwo that doesn't... So the pin is the thing that gets you in. So back then, alright, so back then what we're talking about is you need to, typically today you\nneed a whole track two, you need that valid track two, all right? You need the 16 digit\ncard number forward slash and then whatever that\nalgorithm has out beside of it. All right? Back then none of the banks\nhad implemented that algorithm. So while the algorithm was there, you didn't need it to encode. - [Lex] Interesting. - Interesting. - So you can't make a lot of money with physical of fake credit.\n- Credit card. Credit card not present. Fraud debit cards card not present fraud. Remember I told you was\n30 to $40,000 a month. - [Lex] Yeah. All right. That turned\ninto 30 to $40,000 a day. - [Lex] Yeah. - The Ukrainians, again,\nthey can't cash it out. They've got all the data on the planet but they can't cash it out. Those three necessities of cyber crime. So the deal became, you have\nto rely on the Americans. Tell you what, we'll give you 40%. So you had all these cashiers that were 40% of $40,000 a day. Yeah, we'll take that. Alright. Send the rest of it\nover to by Western Union or what have you to Ukrainian contact. That's before cryptocurrency\ncame into play. Now you had a couple of\nforerunners with E Gold and Liberty Reserve, things like that. But back then it starts out with Western Union, then\nit becomes prepaid cards, sending track information over loading the card up like that. And then finally you get\nto E Gold Liberty Reserve. And then today it's\nwith crypto that's used. Started stealing a lot of money a lot and that got law enforcement attention. So we started to see, I mean\nthis, it's a crazy story. We started to see IPs coming in from law enforcement agencies because back then they didn't know how to shield their identity either. (laughs) So you saw Secret Service, you saw DOD, you saw all these like, and you're like, that's interesting, you know? (both laughing) And at the same time we\nhad, it was called a hack, but it wasn't a hack. We had a guy that worked\nat T-Mobile in Los Angeles. This is the same guy\nthat back then published Paris Hilton's phone contact\nlist that made a lot of news. Not only did he do that, but it turned out that the Los Angeles Secret Service Agency was using T-Mobile phones. So he's getting text messages of the Secret Service\ninvestigating ShadowCrew and he posts those damn\nthings on ShadowCrew. So I'm sitting there\ngoing head of the pile, I'm sitting there going, this is not going to end well, this is not gonna end well. So at the same time I had\naccess, I started out with access to the Indiana State\nSex Offenders Registry and I was using that to create\nbank accounts lot the money out and I would sell the bank\naccounts and stuff like that. They shut that down. The next database I had access to was the Texas Driver's\nlicense database. And started using that to\ncreate fake driver's licenses, what have you. And then finally we happened upon the California Death Index. Alright, complete information,\nmother's maiden, socials, DOBs, all that. And it's like gotta be a use for that. Well you can use it to create\nidentities all day long. My idea was, I wonder if you could take somebody that's died and then file for social\nsecurity death benefit, not death benefits, but\nsocial security benefits for that individual and get\nthat recurring paycheck in. So that takes a lot of\nresearch to start seeing if you can do that. How does the federal\ngovernment know if you're dead? Do federal indexes\nreference state indexes? You got all these questions that pop up. Well it turns out federal indexes don't reference state\nindexes, it's against the law. So it also turns out the only\nway the federal government knows you're dead is prior\nto 1998, the family had to file a social security\ndeath benefit for that person. Alright?\n- Wow. Prior to '98. Of course most people don't. Right? Prior to '98 it took the family. After '98 the hospital can\ndo it, funeral home can do it or the family could do it. So a lot more people have it filed after, if they've died after. - But it's still, there's a lot of people probably-\n- A lot of don't because that death\nbenefit's only like $219. - Okay?\n- Yeah. - Nobody's thinking about that shit. So I started to apply for\nsocial security benefits. Nope, number's dormant. So they want you to come in\nfor a physical interview. Here I am, you know, 32,\nyou're not gonna pass as a 65-year-old, so no. So the next idea I had was wonder if you could file income\ntax returns on these people. Turns out you can all day long. So I started doing that and I started to steal once I got ramped up. 'Cause you test everything,\nyou know, you're testing to make sure you, I gotta figure out what the deposit instrument\nis and everything else. And once you get all\nthat lined out, I started to steal $160,000 a week every week for 10 months outta the year. - By paying taxes? (chuckles) - [Brett] By filing fake tax returns. - Oh yeah, filing fake tax returns. - So you find a business.\n- Yes. - And the way the system worked is the IRS will issue a refund on somebody before they're able to verify that that person worked for an employer. Still works like that today. Alright? - And you're keeping the\namounts relatively low? - [Brett] Keep 'em at $3,000. All right? Amounts are very low. - But you're still able to achieve scale because this large index- - Right, I got to where, and I was manual later\non, a couple buddies of mine went automated with it. - Wait, you were go doing this by hand? So there's no code involved. - All manual.\n- Wow. - I'd file a return\nonce every six minutes, work 10 hours a day, three days a week. - So typing fast and clicking- - One return every six minutes, that's changing IP\nthat's changing address. Everything else wanna return\nevery six minutes (laughs) for three days a week. Fourth day I would take a road\ntrip, plot out a map of ATMs and then the next two days cash out. Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.\nAlright, come back home. Rinse and repeat, turns\nout that a backpack, I don't see any sitting around here, but a backpack will hold $150,000 of twenties is what it'll hold. So I'd put 150K in twenties in a backpack. I had a spare bedroom, I'd come in, toss the backpack in the bedroom. - This is very, very\nimportant information. And the fact that you know it is also very-\n- Yeah. - First we started with the volume of coal that weighs a ton. And now a backpack coal $150,000 of twenties.\n- Yeah. - And then you can multiply that by five or hundreds. - Yeah. - I like this.\n- Well it's 20, most of the time it's 20. It's coming out ATM right? Each 20 weighs a gram.\n- Each 20 weighs a gram. - So you can actually\ngo by weight, which is what federal authorities\ndo when they get a pallet of cash, they just weigh it. - [Lex] Oh, do they just weigh it? Okay. - 150K is seven and a half\nkeys of cash. (laughs) - 15. Oh that's pretty light. - Not bad. Not bad.\n- Yes. You get big backpack, go do a good run with David Goggins with it.\n- Yeah. Nice. - I like it. So, and the\nfact you know this is great. So wait, where does that\ncome in with the backpack? - So what happens is, I didn't\nknow how to launder money. Alright. So, you know, I'm throwing\ncash in the spare bedroom. One day you open up the bedroom\nand you're like, (laughs) gotta do something with those backpacks. And that's when you start learning how to launder money, you know, cash based businesses, things like that. I had a production company, had a couple of detailing company, I was thinking about\ngoing into food trucks, things like that in Charleston Central. - Actually, can you pause on\nthat to take a tangent there? How does money laundering work? I mean, at that time and what years are we talking about chat? - This is by the time the tax\nreturn schemes go into play. We're talking 2002. 2003\nis when tax returns start. - And so what at that time and what you're aware\nof now, how it evolved, how does money laundering work? - You know, it's not that much\ndifferent. It's really not. You get a cash based business, start laundering the money\nor putting the money through that saying that transactions are legal. You then start depositing\ninto bank accounts from the bank accounts. My thing was is have bank accounts in the United States, Mexico, Canada, and then finally bounce over to Estonia was the final\ndestination of all this stuff. And the idea is to try to\nmove them to so many places that by the end of the day it looks legal and you can't trace it all if you're ever caught,\nwhich you ultimately are. But so cash based businesses- - So when you say, sorry to interrupt the\ncash based businesses. So you have money that needs to be moved to other people. So how does that work?\nWhat's the business? Are people providing you a service and you're giving them money? - Right, so you do the Ozark\nthing if you wanna do that. So you can gamble cash out\nsome like that over trips to whatever casinos you've got. You've got your production\ncompany or your detail company. So how many cars are you cleaning a day? How many companies have\nyou got to do that? Alright, whatever that company\nis. It's gotta be cash based. Somebody's paying you in\ncash, is what you're doing. You have to have enough of\nthose cash based businesses where it doesn't look funny. All right? Because if you're a detail company making a hundred thousand dollars\na month, that's a problem. (chuckles) - [Lex] Yeah. - Okay? So then you start\ndepositing into that. Well because of the Patriot Act as a suspicious activity report, SARS came in at $2,500 instead of\nthe 10K that it used to be. So all of a sudden you've\ngot multiple bank accounts that you've gotta set up. Alright? Fortunately what you also\nhad is you had a bunch of prepaid debit cards that were coming into play at the same time. So a combination of bank\naccounts, prepaid debits that had ACH abilities\nattach those as well. And you start running 'em all together. Then once it's outta the United States, you don't have to worry as much. You can start funneling that\ninto fewer bank accounts until finally you've\ngot the one main account that's over at Bank Latco and Estonia at that\npoint is what you've got. - [Lex] So a bunch of hops that end up at a place\nthat you can't trace. - And to give you an idea, I was arrested February 8th, 2005. My last seizure was 2010,\ngot the last seizure notice. So took him, they got it, (laughs) but it did took 'em,\nthat long to get to it. - So how do stories like with Script that come into play here\nwhere he had someone who owed him money,\nkidnapped and tortured. So when does it turn darker? - It turns darker when\nthe more money you make. Script was a kid that he\nwas stealing enough money that he was able to buy\nwhatever estate he wanted to. And he would brag about\ntouring the countryside. And if he saw property that\nhe liked, he would buy it. And that was not just a\nbrag, he was doing that. So this kid is stealing a lot of money. At the same time, he's got\nconnections politically 'cause of his family. He's got connections and that family's got connections\nwith the Ukrainian mob. Alright? So he's got these inroads and\npeople are looking out for him and he's stealing a lot\nof money at the same time. Somebody doesn't pay him\na decent amount of money. Somebody doesn't pay him. Now we had never, with\nShadowCrew, with CarderPlanet, with Counterfeit Library,\nwe were basically the geeks. Alright? We were just the fraudsters,\nthe social engineers. We had never really considered violence. The rules that I had in play were, Hey, we don't do child pornography, we don't do counterfeit\ncurrency, we don't do drugs. And the only thing we\nended up really obeying was the child porn stuff, except for Max Butler, who you mentioned earlier. Script, someone rips the guy off and he comes online on\nShadowCrew at that point and he posts these pictures one day. And I mean, it was a detailed narrative through the pictures. Had the guy that rammed in\nthe van, he had the door open, rammed in the van, had the guy tied up, had the guy being tortured. And the response was, this is what happens when you steal from me. And that's the first time that violence came into\nplay at that point. And that's when you start\nrealizing things are getting a little serious. - How did that make you feel? - The first response is, can't be real. He's just, that's he's just doing that. You know, he's just, he's\nwanting to send a message. Then you're like, no,\nthat's real. That's real. - Were you afraid in your own heart that you might descend to that too? Like if you see that, or was\nit pretty clear to you that that's a line that some people\ncan cross and some can't and you're not one of\nthose that can cross it? - You know, I gotta tell\nyou, I joke with my wife. The joke I tell my wife is, you know, if I knew some guy that\nhad 8,000 Bitcoins, I might be persuaded to\nask him for access to that. And she was like, how? And I was like, well, hammer and toes. - [Lex] Yeah. - And I say that as a joke, but there's that line where you're like, I remember who I used to be. And if you're looking\nat that kind of money, I might be persuaded to do that back then. And I think that's was\nScript's issue, is he, it was a lot of money to him. - Was the money. And then there's, you know,\nviolence can also be gradual. So over time you do a\nlittle more, a little more, a little more, a little more. - You get used to what's going on. And then like, get desensitized - And you figure, you take somebody like, like Ross Ulbricht, the\nSilk Road guy, alright? Ross was not a violent guy. He was not. But at that point in time, you know, he was sitting on 24 million in Bitcoin. He was the only game in town. And that 24 now is like, I don't know, 22, 24\nbillion, some crap like that. But he felt in danger. This guy was gonna turn him in it was a black mount him everything. So Ross thinks he hires a\ncouple hit men to kill the guy. So it becomes that thing. And I saw that over and over again. And I'd like to say I wasn't like that. But given the same circumstances, I would've probably done the same thing. - And also, it's not just about money. There's a lot of other forces,\nlike if you're threatened for your wellbeing or for your wealth or for your power, it's all\nunder different motivations. - Plus that online aspect\nfor those communities like that, if you're the\nhead guy, you really feel like you're the parent of these guys. So if somebody's starting\nto threaten them, it's like, alright, what do I need to do? - So what do you make of silk\nroast the ShadowCrew started something that today you can call darknet and darknet markets. So these markets that operate,\nthat trade things, everything from child pornography to drugs to, I mean, what else?\n- Everything. - What are the dark things\nthat humans want to do that they don't want anyone to know about? All of those things.\n- Right. - So, can you maybe\ntell me, you know what, let's just even step back. What is the darknet? How big is it? What happens there? - Let's backtrack a little bit more before we get to that.\n- Yes. - All right, what ShadowCrew\ndid, other than dealing in all these stolen wares,\nwhat ShadowCrew did, that's really important. Remember those three\nnecessities that I talked about. But the important thing\nis it established trust among criminals. Alright? Because that's a necessity. You have to be able to trust\nwho you're dealing with. 'Cause you have to deal with somebody. You have to, alright, so how do you know you're\nnot dealing with a cop? How do you know you're dealing\nwith somebody that's skilled? How do you know you're\ngonna deal with somebody that's not gonna rip you off? You gotta be able to\ntrust that individual. The ShadowCrew provided that\ntrust mechanism for criminals. You had that communication\nchannel, the forums where you could reference\nconversations, weeks, months, old, take part, learn\nfrom those conversations. You had vouching systems\nand review systems in place, escrow systems in place. You could knew by looking\nat someone's screen name if you could trust the individual network with the individual. Alright? And that community of just humans provided that backbone of trust. And that's really interesting\nwhen you think about it. You had the trust that was there, but you also had this, almost this instantaneous information\nthat was available about the community or about\ncyber crime at large. And that's still in play today. Alright? So when that was the way things were until a couple of things happened. And one was cryptocurrency,\nthe other one was the Tor browser, the dark web. Now I was working with the\nSecret Service, ripping the Secret Service off\nwhen Tor comes into play. Alright? So we got a memo in one day and it was talking about the Tor browser and it was like, we really\nneed to be careful with this. This is gonna be problem. And so we all fired up the Tor browser This was 2005, early '06. Turns out it was completely unusable. Could not use it at all simply\nbecause no one was using it. And it was extremely slow. - So people don't know,\nTor browser is a way to be completely anonymous. - As long as you properly know how to use it.\n- Right. - Huge caveat.\n- Yeah. - Alright. So developed by the United States Navy and they developed it.\n- Didn't know this. - Yeah, I did not, oh yeah. - It wasn't the hackers that?\n- U-huh. - Interesting. - US Navy. To this day, the number one funder of Tor, military to this day, all right? - Interesting. I mean the same, I\nguess with the internet. The origins are-\n- So it was developed so that operatives could communicate-\n- Interesting. - With each other\nwithout being identified. Alright. It then goes open source,\nthey release it, EFF comes in and starts sponsoring\neverything else like that. The next idea was, well,\nyou know, people can get around their country's firewalls, whistleblowers can use\nit, things like that. Well, someone forgot to\nmention that the first adoptees of tech, if you can\nuse it to launder money or remain anonymous, are criminals. And so criminals start to\nuse the damn thing. Alright? So along the same time we get, well a few years later we\nget Satoshi Nakamoto pops up with his ideas for Bitcoin, and then Ross Ulbricht runs with it. Ross Ulbricht decides he's\ngonna start up Silk Road. So initially the people\nwho were using Tor, which later is the dark\nweb people were using Tor, were just talking with each\nother, visiting websites, communicating like that. Someone figured out, Hey man, we could host\nwebsites on this thing. And they have a lot of\ntrouble finding the box. So that is the advent of\nSilk Road all of a sudden. Ross Ulbricht has this idea that he's gonna change the world by becoming the largest\ndrug dealer on the planet. So he opens up the Silk Road and the payment instrument\nhe allows is Bitcoin. So if those people out there\nare wondering why Bitcoin is going at what, 44K today?\n- Yeah. And by the time this is out, it could be 100,000 or 10,000. - [Brett] Absolutely. Absolutely. We'll see, who knows. (laughs) If it's 10,000, I'm gonna buy some buy. (both laughing) - Which is a hilarious statement to make because that statement\nwould be ridiculously wrong like five years ago. Right?\n- I know, I know, I know. - And people a hundred years\nfrom now would be laughing. Wait, it was that low. (both laughing) - So back then, so he\nonly accepts Bitcoin. And of course the initial use case of crypto is, no one\nwants to admit it today, but the initial use case is,\nwe're gonna buy a bunch of pot. (laughs) And we need somebody, we\nneed a way to pay for it. So that's what happens. Ross. It's really interesting to me. If you look at motivations\nof cyber criminals, the motivations are\nstatus, cash, ideology. Alright? My guys all cash across\nthe board, all cash. Ross' ideology, he really believed he was gonna change the world. He really didn't. I've been fortunate. I actually know the guy\nwho ran Silk Road two and have talked to the\nkid, everything else. And I will tell you that\nthose guys who are motivated by ideology, they are a\ncompletely different breed. They really are. It's not, you know, the cash\nguy, it's low hanging fruit. The ease of it's hard to\nstop committing crime. But it's much easier for a\ncash motivated individual to stop than it is that ideology guy, that Silk Road two guy, he's still got it. You know, he's not breaking the law, but you can see it's like\nhe wants to. (laughs) He wants to. - That's fascinating that I mean the worst atrocities\nin human history are committed with people that operate under ideology. All the other motivations in which weaker. - But you, you know, you think about it and you've got, with Ross, I mean, very bright guy, very bright guy. But think about the amount\nof cognitive dissonance that the guy's got, that he thinks he's gonna change the world by running a drug site. I mean, he certainly, I mean, could he have changed the world? Yeah. Could he have done it\nlike that? Probably not. - Well, I can steel man those arguments. I listen to quite a few libertarians, and you can push that to anarchists and, you know, there's a\nlot of people that argue. So I actually talked to\nfaculty, to a professor at Columbia who actually argues that all drugs should be legalized. And not at a philosophical\nlevel, political level, but the fact that all the\nnegative consequences of drugs that people talk about actually have to do with other factors in your life. - [Brett] I would agree with that. - And so that's a, okay, but that's more like a argument about\nnegative aspects of drugs. I think the ideology comes in where it's like, well, nobody should\ntell you what to do. You should have the responsibility of your own actions like the government or any other institution\nshouldn't be the rule setters the constraints for\nhow you live your life. And so that I could see\nthat argument being made. And ultimately, if you\nlike, create an open market for drugs, how that could\nbuild a better society. It might break down the\noutdated, the corrupt, the bureaucratic institutions. I mean, you can make that argument. - There's argument, there's an argument. And let's be fair, I\nwanna be fair with it. Yeah. I mean, could,\ndid he change the world? We do have this whole thing\ncalled cryptocurrency. - [Lex] Yeah. In the long\narc of history, perhaps. Yeah, we do have that. So that's a biggie. - And that might have\nbeen for it to take hold in society, maybe the darker\nparts of society at first. Maybe that was necessary. - Right? I mean, maybe I see how it pans out. ShadowCrew, we had this guy, Albert Gonzalez, this\nkid's name, we were growing so big that I had to\nstart farming things out. So the first thing I started farming, I instituted this review\nsystem, kind of establishing that trust mechanism even\nfurther for criminals to use. We needed somebody to take\ncare of our tech aspects of the forum. So associate of mine by the name of Kim Taylor, where we were looking for a forum techie, he\ncomes to me one night and he is like, \"Founder forum techie\". And I was like, \"Who's that?\" And he is like, \"It's this kid.\" And I was like, \"Is any good?\" He's like, \"Well, he knows the software.\" And I was like, \"Okay,\nwe just signed his on.\" He went by the screen name of CumbaJohnny was his screen name. And he starts selling credit cards after a while under a\nscreen name of Scarface. And that CVV one breach\nwhere you're cashing out the track twos at ATMs,\nyou know, $40,000 a day. So Albert's in New Jersey\none day, broad daylight and stands at an ATM for 40 minutes, just standing there\nfeeding in one ATM card after another point out cash,\ntaking the twenties out, stuffing 'em in that backpack. Meanwhile, just across\nthe street, a couple of cops just happened to be there. And they start noticing this\nkid's just standing there. So 40 minutes, they watch\nthis kid, 40 minutes. Finally one cop looks at the other, let me see what's going on there. (Lex chuckles) Walks over across the street,\nAlbert's wearing a wig, he's got the disguise on\neverything else like that. Ask him, \"Kid, what are you\ndoing?\" Albert falls apart. We didn't know Albert had been arrested. So Albert immediately\ngoes in, I wanna work for the Secret Service. At that point in time,\nSecret Service I referred to, and I wanna make sure I don't say it's not like that anymore. But back then they were\nfucking idiots, alright? They had no clue what was going on. - There was a competence issue that they were working\nthrough, is one way to put it. - That's a nice euphemism. So, (laughs) they were fucking idiots is another way to say it. - So they're just like not\naware of this digital world. - They had no clue, no clue. The way that Albert tells\nthem how to catch us because they looked at\nhim, how do we catch 'em? (both laughing) And Albert's like, Albert, I'm\nserious. Yeah, I'm serious. So Albert's like, \"Well,\nyou could try a VPN.\" \"What's a VPN?\"\n- Yeah. - So he explains it to 'em. They're like, \"That's a good idea.\" So I quit ShadowCrew. I was worried about all the news that was coming in and\neverything like that. I'm stealing 160K a week. I didn't know Albert had been arrested. I'm worried about being arrested. I know the writing's on the wall and I'm like, \"I'm quitting, I retire.\" - Where did you see the writing?\n- That were coming in? - Yeah. - The text messages about the\nSecret Service investigators referred to building to\nhow the pressures building. It's not gonna end well, man,\nthis is not gonna end well. This is going to be bad. So I announced my\nretirement of February 15th. I'm sorry, April 15th,\n2004 is my retirement. Yeah, I think that's 2004. And I quit. I walk away. Well,\nAlbert had been arrested. They cut him loose. No one\nknows he's been arrested. He comes back into ShadowCrew. I leave Kim Taylor at the same time, he's kind of on the run. Which, if you wanna know that story, that's a nightmare story in and of itself. So my second in charge,\nKim Taylor, this guy, there was this guy named David. Oh, what was his name? He was El Mariachi, was the\nguy's name David Thomas. (Brett laughs) David. Yeah, he was a film guy. - [Lex] Scarface. - Yeah, so El Mariachi,\nreal name David Thomas. He's on the run out of\nNebraska for check fraud. He comes to us on ShadowCrew\ntelling us this sad story. We take up a collection for\nthis guy, send it to him. Alright? I get him a job working with a low level carder\ntrying to make him some money. Alright? El Mariachi or Thomas\ndoes this for a few weeks. Comes to me one day and he's like, \"Man, I'm not making any money.\" I'm like, \"Okay, lemme see what I can do.\" Well, I had a Ukrainian guy by the name of Big Buyer,\nhe real friend of mine. And I contacted him I was like, \"Look man, I got a guy that wants to do some work. Can you help the guy out?\" And he's like, \"I got\nhim.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" So he sends Thomas enough money to go. Thomas is in Texas at that\npoint, sends Thomas enough money to go from Texas to Issaquah, Washington and rent an office space. Alright? So Thomas goes up there,\nrents his office space, him and his girlfriend rents an office space. And the plan is this Big Buyer is going to place an order, get product sent. Mariachi is gonna get the\nproduct listed on eBay. Cash out 50/50. Easy enough, alright? So Big Buyer places an order. First order is outpost.com, $18,000, the largest order\noutpost.com had ever received at that point in time.\n- Okay? - Order goes through.\n- Goes through still. - Goes through, he gets the product. All right, Mariachi comes\nback, tells my second in charge, Kim Taylor. Kim Taylor at this point,\nI'm 33, 34. Kim Taylor's 46. He works at the tattered cover bookstore in Denver, Colorado is where\nhe works at this point. And he fancies himself\nJason Bourne. Alright. He's even got one of the\nscreen names of Jason Bourne. So I'm like, \"All right.\" So Mariachi's telling us\nhow much money he's making, everything else. I'm like, \"Well, that's good.\nI'm glad you're all right.\" Kim contacts me like, \"I\nwant to go to Issaquah.\" And I was like, \"Why?\" And he's\nlike, \"To make some money.\" I'm like, \"You're making money.\" He's like, \"I wanna go to Issaquah.\" I was like, \"All right, go be careful.\" So he gets in the car. (laughs) Saturn is what he is driving. He drives his little piece of shit, Saturn all the way up to Issaquah,\ngets there, you know, midnight. They party all night long because they've never met each other. They're just celebrating\npartying, drinking, everything else like that. Meanwhile, Big Buyer has\nplaced another order, with outpost.com, $17,000, the second largest order outpost.com had ever received at that point in time. By this point in time,\noutpost knows the first order was fraudulent. Guess where it's going? The exact same address,\nthe first order goes. So Outpost picks up the\nphone calls is Issaquah PD, \"Hey, we got a fraudster.\" Issaquah is like, \"Would you\nmind sending some empty boxes?\" And Outpost is like, \"Be happy to.\" So the rule was, is on credit card fraud, if you've got full account\naccess, you place the order the morning that's supposed\nto arrive, you sign into the bank account or\nthe credit card account. If you can sign in, you\ngo pick up your product. If you can't sign in, you\ngo back to sleep that day. Alright, well, Big Buyer\nwas the guy who placed the order, Mariachi and my\nsecond in charge are partying. Alright? So they're supposed to\ncontact Big Buyer, they don't. Meanwhile, Big Buyer is\nraising hell, getting up with me like, \"Hey, where are you? Where are the guys? I can't find them. They don't need to pick up this product.\" So I can't get in touch with 'em. They go down to pick up the... So Mariachi's got a\nCadillac, old '70s Cadillac, he's got a Cadillac\npulls into the complex. Now Mariachi's driving, Kim\nTaylor's in the passenger seat. David Thomas's girlfriend's\nin the back seat as they pull into the complex\ngoing through the parking lot. Mariachi just happens to\nglance over and he sees a van with a guy sitting sideways\nin the van, and he looks at Kim Taylor and he is\nlike, that's an undercover. And Kim's like, \"Ah, it's fine.\" (laughs) So they pull up to the office complex. Kim's like, \"I'll go in\nand get the packages.\" So he walks in, looks at the guy behind the counter, I believe\nyou have some packages for us guy's, like one second. So (laughs) he disappear around the wall, out pops Issaquah PD, arrests Kim. David Thomas is in the car\nwatching all this happen. He bugs out and they arrest\nhim on the interstate where he has three fake\ndriver's licenses in his wallet, along with his real driver's license. Another no-no, but they get him. So David Thomas had outstanding\nwarrants out in Nebraska. We couldn't bond him out. Kim Taylor didn't have any\nwarrants, so we bonded him out. My third in charge kid,\nSeth Sanders was his name. He bonds him out, uses his girlfriend's\naccount to bond him out. And I get Marriott, not,\nI get Kim Taylor to go to Utah where he, another\nfriend of mine agrees to house him, him and his wife. So I think everything's fine and all that. About three weeks later,\nthis guy in Utah gets me on the phone, \"Hey,\nhe's gotta go.\" (laughs) I'm like, \"What's going on?\" He's like, \"Well, the\nonly thing he's doing is popping ecstasy tablets\nevery day, all day.\" And I'm like, \"Seriously?\"\nHe is like, \"Yeah.\" I was like, \"Okay, he's gotta go.\" So we kick him out of there. By this point, I've got another\ncrew that's coming through. I mean, I had all these crews\nrunning, had another crew that's coming through Denver,\nsend Kim back to Denver to partner up with these guys. Kim gets these guys arrested. So by this point in time, I'm exasperated, I just wanna throw my hands\nup in the air and walk away. So my retirement's coming\nup at the same time. So I'm like, \"Fuck it, I'm done.\" So I tell everybody,\nthe rest of the admins and the mods there, I'm like,\nthis is what's going on. You guys need to watch out for this. We need to ban Kim, not let him back in. Be careful what's going on.\" I walk away at the same\ntime I walk away, come to Johnny, Albert Gonzalez\ncomes back into play. He sees everything that's going on. He uses that to his advantage. He starts banning\neveryone that's suspicious of him sets up the VPN at the same time and says, Hey, to make\nsure we're all secure, I need all transactions\nto go through this VPN. VPNs ran by the Secret Service. Alright. Secret Service ends up, I\nthink they ended up cataloging like $7 million worth of\ntransactions over the next four or five months. ShadowCrew makes the front\ncover of Forbes August, 2004, headline, Who's Stealing Your identity? October 26th, 2004, United\nStates Secret Service arrest, 33 people, six countries, six hours. I was in Charleston, South\nCarolina when I saw it happen. And I'm like. (laughs) - You're the one that got away. - I'm the one public, there\nwere a couple other guys that got away that they\ndidn't publicly mention. One, his name was Tron. He was-\n- In the Zero. - Yeah, exactly. But he went\nby the screen named Tron. He had access, almost unfettered\naccess to Bank of America. So what happens is they\nidentified the guy, Secret Service is in\nthe air to go get him. They call the Ukrainian police, Hey, we're coming down to arrest this guy. Ukrainian cops are like, oh, come on down. So as soon as they got off the phone, Ukrainian cops get in the car, go down and tell Tron, \"Hey,\nthey're coming to get ya.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So (laughs) he bugs\nout, down to South America and they don't catch 'em. I think for six or seven years after that, something like that.\n- Caught him eventually. - But caught him eventually. - Well, let me actually ask\nyou on this point, you said that, \"If you do cyber crime eventually, it's not gonna end well.\"\n- It does not end well. - Why is that? - So, I don't wanna say that's because you're gonna be arrested because honestly, very\nfew people are arrested. Alright? But it doesn't end well\nbecause of the type of person that you become. You quoted me earlier, \"You\nlie to everybody around you. You lie to yourself,\nyou lie to your friends, you lie to your family. Of course you lie to your victims. You don't have any friends.\" I went 20 years without friends. I had associates, I didn't have friends. - [Lex] And you can't truly trust- - You don't trust anybody. You don't trust anybody. I had my wife, I was\nmarried for nine years. I lied to her every single\nday of those nine years. And it took her nine years\nto give up on me to realize that I was that piece of shit. And she leaves at that point. Then from there I started dating\na stripper and lied to her. Lied to her, I thought I had friends. I lied to all those people that I knew that thought they were my friends. I lied to 'em. The entire time you\nbecome that individual. I don't think a lot of people really\nunderstand how bad that is. You know, you pointed out that woman that I ripped off, she\nwas trying to put a roof on her house for frigging kids, man. You're that person, you're that person. - You're also lying to yourself. And that's not a mindset in\nwhich you can grow as a person. Find happiness, find genuine,\nsimple human affection, which is what love is. - [Brett] Yeah. - Simple, real friendship. All of those things. - Right. So, you know, I\nwent to prison, of course. One of the things that, one\nof the most important lessons that I've learned in prison, because cyber crime, crime as a whole, if you're a criminal, it's\nan addiction, alright? If you're addicted to something,\nwhether it be drugs, crime, gambling, what have you, if\nyou're addicted to something, you cannot love anything\nelse except the addiction. The addiction comes first. Alright? And, you know, you pointed out some of those truly despicable things. Script for example, torches that guy. You get to the point where it's like, okay, this is the business. And you know, I tried to\nconvince myself that, you know, I'm a businessman, but I'm\na good guy on the other end. And you're not. You're not. So those lies become a\npart of everything else. And, yeah, you get the higher\nups are usually arrested. They are. But you know, you've got millions of cyber criminals these days. So most guys are not gonna be arrested. So you may be arrested, you may be like freaking Jonathan\nJames, he was a minor. A very, very talented\nindividual, very competent. As kid, he had broke\ninto NASA, DOD Pentagon. He shut the NASA computers\ndown for six weeks. This is the, that kid\nthen he decides he wants to go into credit card\ntheft partners with Albert. He's arrested with Albert. Law enforcement, they\nwere gonna blame him. He was the only competent individual. So this kid gets up one day,\nhe wasn't in prison yet. He gets up one day, goes\nin his dad's bedroom, gets out his 45, walks in the bathroom and blows his brains out. You've got things like that. Or you're gonna rip somebody\noff and you're gonna end up like Scripted with that guy. The guy who hit, who ran\nevolution marketplace, the one who, two people ran\nthat, the guy and a girl. And no one knew who they were. He ends up stealing\nabout $24 million, a lot of it from Ukrainian mob. And they found him about a year later on a beach without his head and hands. But, you know, it always goes south. But more than anything, to\nme, the negative thing is, is you really become\nsomebody that, I mean, just truly a despicable human being. When you get to the point when you steal, you're destroying people's\nretirement accounts. You're stealing money from\na woman that simply wants to do something good for her family. When you become that individual, and you're okay with that. My God, man, it got to the\npoint, I had one guy ripped off. It's like for $900 is when I first started the cyber crime stuff, it's\nwhen I was becoming competent. And I ripped him off for like $900. And he sent me an email and he was like, the email said something like, I guess you needed the money and it's okay, you know, you keep it. And I'm getting chills\nright now thinking about it. But it's that where you\nbecome that individual, yeah. - Can I actually backtrack? Listen, I love, love, okay.\n- I do too. - And there's a story that you fell in love with the stripper. I mean, you have to tell the story. So how did you fall in love with somebody? Not that there's anything\nwrong with that profession, but it's romantic. It's like that true romance,\nby the way. Great movie. - It is a great film.\nIt's truly a great film. - Even Brad Pitt who makes a\nbrief appearance is genius. There's so much good acting there. Anyway, so tell me that love story. - Like I said, I get from my dad, I get that fear of being abandoned. You know, I lied to my wife for\nnine years until she leaves. And I was in Charleston, South Carolina. And what happened was, I noticed that Susan, she was not coming\nto bed like she used to. And she'd stay up all night\nlong and sometimes she'd go and be gone a few hours\nor, and everything else. And I'm like, well, something's going on. And I'd pass by her, her computer and she would minimize the screens. And I'm like, \"Well, gotta figure out\nwhat the hell's going on.\" So put a key logger on her system- - As anybody should in a relationship. - Absolutely. 'Cause you trust them. (laughs) You know, so why not? - You should be tracking\nall their movements, all their-\n- Exactly, exactly. Like I said, I was the control freak too.\n- It's romantic. - So I found out she\nhad been cheating on me and she was-\n- See? There you go. You had a reason.\n- Had reason I justified. So I found out she was cheating on me. She was asleep when I found it out. And I sat there looking at,\nand I was like, well shit. So got up, walked in the\nbedroom, opened up the wardrobe, got a suitcase out, started\nputting her clothes in it. Then she wakes up, she's\nlike, \"Where are you going?\" I'm like, \"I'm not, you are.\" Well my bravado\ndisappeared pretty quickly. I took about a week of both of us crying and arguing and everything\nelse and she finally left. And I went through this depression. I was in Charleston, South Carolina. I would just walk around\nthe house, kind of stumbling in a daze, realized I was getting suicidal and was smart enough to\ndo something about it. And picked up the phone book. And that's where there's\nalways this sense of humor. So I picked up the phone book, I'm going through the yellow pages. I'm like, psychologist,\ncriminal psychologist, ' cause I need that. (both laughing) And called this psychologist crying to her, I mean, crying on the phone. Told her everything, I'm this criminal, this is what's happened. She's like, \"Come in now.\" I was like, go in, spill my guts. And saw her for about four months. And I joke about, well it's true. She was trying to get me\nto stop breaking the law and to go into real estate. And I remember telling her,\n\"Is there a difference?\" (laughs) She was like, \"Yes, there's a difference.\" So saw her for about\nfour months. I was 34. I didn't start drinking until I was 34. Had never done drugs,\nanything else like that. 'Cause my mom was an addict\nas well. So I was this guy. I always wanted to be in control. Didn't wanna, you know,\nlose control of myself and had never been to the strip club. So one night I was getting lonely. So I walked into the strip club, actually I was researched this strip club and it was Joe's Roundup in Charleston, South Carolina.\n- Joe's Roundup. - Joe's Roundup, little\nbitty hole in the wall stuff. I was, yeah, real classy. So I walked in and I'm literally\nthat guy, man that fell in love with the first, the\nfirst stripper that he sees. She walks by, I'm like, \"That one.\" So I didn't know, I didn't\nknow the strip club game. I'm again, criminal naive as hell. So belly up at the bar, order the beer. I'm sitting there drinking it. She comes over to me and\nwe start chatting, talking. And she's like, would you like\nto get a bottle of champagne? I was like, does does that\nmean going in back or what? And she's like, \"Well yeah, you need to do\nthe bottle of going back.\" And I was like, \"Sure, let's\nbuy a bottle of champagne. $400 bottle of Korbel.\"\n- Wow. - So (laughs) I'm like, \"Alright.\" And again, that bravado\ndisappears pretty quickly. I get back there and\nwe talk for two hours. And you know, nowadays I don't understand that most men who go to\nstrip clubs, the strippers are their therapist most of the time. Alright. So I'm sitting there\ntalking, we're talking and of course she's sizing me up. She's looking at the watch, she's like, \"What kind of car\nyou drive?\" (laughs) You know, everything else. And\nI'm like telling her talking. And so at the end of the night I'm like, \"Really nice meeting.\" She's like, \"It's so nice\nmeeting you too.\" So I leave. - So you guys just talked-\n- Just talked. - And there's still no dancing, this feeling of love and all that. - Yeah, so just talked,\ngot along pretty good. I'm like, \"I like her, I like her.\" So come back in a week later,\nwalk in and call her over. And I was like, \"Look.\" I said, \"I'm not.\" I said, \"that was my first\ntime to a strip club.\" I said, \"don't know you. I like you, I'd like you to know you more. Would you like to go out to dinner?\" And she was like, \"Yeah.\" I was like, \"Where would you like to go?\" So she says, \"Rudi John.\" And I was like, \"Don't know what it is,\nthat's where we'll go.\" So I go back and I was,\nI had a theater buddy at that point in time 'cause I was trying to\nget my life together. JC was his name. And I\nwas like, \"I got a date.\" And he's like, \"You got a date?\" I was like, \"Yeah man, I got a date.\" And he's like, \"Okay,\nwhere are you going?\" And I was like, \"Ru Dejan.\" And he is like, \"Take\nyour wallet.\" (laughs) I'm like, \"Yeah.\" And he's\nlike, \"Take your wallet.\" I was like, \"Alright.\" So we start, you know, doing\nthe lunch and the dinner thing. And I get to where I really like her. I was 34, she was 23 and\ngot along really well. Listened, you know, had common\ninterest in music and arts and stuff like that. She had, I mean, a stereotypical, she had graduated college with a degree in religious studies.\n- Wow. - Yeah. So I was like, all right. - So yeah you just fell in love. - Yeah, we got along\nreally well. Really well. So I ended up moving her in with me. She hadn't quit her job. And what was happening was\nshe was working weekends and you know, the club\nwould close at 3:00 or 4:00. She wouldn't come home until\n10:00 or 11:00 in the morning. And most of the time it\nwould be a phone call saying come and pick me\nup, I can't drive home. And then I'd never used\ndrugs, had never been around and my mom Valium and\npot and things like that. But as far as interacting with her, I'd never done anything like that. By this point in time, I'm kind of getting head over heels with her. I've moved in with me and everything and I had never, I was\n34, I had never went through a woman's purse my entire life. And so she comes in, passes out and I'm like, \"I gotta\nknow what the going on.\" And went over and went through\nher purse, found cocaine and you know, the straw cut\noff straws and all that stuff. And I'm like, broke my heart. I just sat there and started crying. Got online and I'm the guy\nthat can find information. So I started looking for forums on strip clubs, found a forum. I found that one found\nwhere it was talking about her prostituting\nherself to support the habit. And that got me, man. That got me, I was talking\nabout everything she was doing to do that. - [Lex] And that broke your heart there. Oh man. Yeah. So went and I didn't have\nthe heart to tell her that I knew she was\nprostitute, but I went to her and I was like, she's waking up. And I was like, \"Look, I\nfound this in your purse. I can't have that.\" And she's like, \"Well, you\nthink I'm prostituting?\" I was like, \"No, no, I don't think that.\" I knew it, but I didn't mention it to her. And I was like, \"I can't have that.\" \"Well I don't do that. It's\njust a one time thing.\" I was like, \"All right.\" So she went back to work and continued to do it\nfor a couple more weeks. And then finally I was like, \"I can't.\" So I picked her up one morning as like she was couldn't drive home before I picked her up\nI had written her note, left it on the pillow. So I brought her home,\ntucked her in the bed and told her I'd be back that night. Told her she had a\nletter when she woke up. I woke up and the letter was\nbasically, you know, I love you if you can't stop this, don't\nbe here when I get back. And I went to Columbia that day, came back that night and she had quit her job and she quit drugs that\nnight, really quit 'em. And I got it in my head that I needed to do whatever I needed to do to make sure she didn't go back to that. That became that to me\nbecause of my background. That meant spending a lot of money. And so every night was, you\nknow, three to $600 for dinner. It was a thousand\ndollars shoes every week. $2,000 purse every week. All that. I had most of my money\nlaundered out to Estonia. And Elizabeth at the same time she quit, but she didn't want me to go anywhere. Alright, all right. She\nwanted me there all the time. I guess that was that connection. You know, she, I guess she was scared she might go back to something. So ShadowCrew gets\nbusted and I start, I go through basically all my\nUS funds can't get anything from overseas. ShadowCrew gets busted October. I can't go into committing tax fraud because season's over, can't go back into credit fraud because\nShadowCrew's been busted. I don't know who to trust online. I'm left with running\ncounterfeit cashier's checks to get money in trying to make it until, you know, I can start\nback with some other fraud and lying to her the entire time. - She knows about none of this? - None of none of it. She thinks I've got a shit load of money and she's got expensive taste. And at the same time she\ncouldn't be intimate. I mean the girl loved me, that's the first time\nI've really said that. - [Lex] So there's deep\nlove there both ways? - Yeah. Yeah. - [Lex] The things we do. - She couldn't be intimate\nunless she was stone cold drunk. I mean, just stone cold drunk. And I didn't mind her drinking alcohol. I'd rather have that than cocaine. So that was the intimacy there. And I kept thinking if I continue to invest that it would work out. You know, that just keep\ngoing. She'll be all right. We'll be all right. And what happens is like I\nsaid, she thought I had money. She thought I had money. She wanted a couple of\nTiffany engagement rings. So I said, \"We can get married.\" I figured if marriage show her that I love her, show her\nit's gonna be all right. So I was like, \"Oh, let's get married.\" She's like, \"Well I've always\nwanted a Tiffany ring.\" I didn't have money to\nbuy the Tiffany ring 'cause all my money was overseas. So here, I've defrauded. So\nit's counterfeit cashier's. I find like a three karat\nring on eBay for 20 grand and pay for it with a\ncounterfeit cashier's check. At the same time because\nshe doesn't want me to leave, she needs me there. Typically, if you're doing\nthat type of crime, you need to be traveling. You can't do it in one central area because you're gonna be\nidentified pretty quickly. I knew that, but I\ndidn't have much choice. So start running\ncounterfeit cashier's checks to get the money to live and everything. Get the engagement ring. We were scheduled to be married. Our wedding date was February 26th, 2005. February 8th, 2005. I've got a Tiffany wedding band, a couple of 'em coming in and I get arrested in Charleston, South Carolina. And she didn't know. I told her, I said, \"I've\ngotta go pick up those rings.\" She didn't, she thought I\nwas just having 'em sent in, said \"I gotta go get those rings.\" And I said, \"we'll go out\nto dinner after that.\" And I left at like eight\no'clock in the morning and I was arrested at I think\n11:30, something like that. Of course I wanted to call her, you know, and the FBI got me, it turns\nout it was controlled delivery. There were like 30 agents\nin the parking lot. FBI got me and Charleston PD got me. Within 45 minutes the\nSecret Service comes in, takes over that investigation. They knew exactly who they had. About seven o'clock at night, they're like, \"We wanna search your house.\" And I was, \"Look, I'll\nsign off on the search if you let me go with\nyou so I can see her.\" And they were like, \"Okay.\" So I gotta see my phone at\nthat point had like 140 calls that she, where she had been\ntrying to call that time. - She was worried.\n- Yeah. - And so they load me up and held, I mean you talk\nabout 10, 12 cars, you know, 40 agents, everything else. She's got a dog at that point. I'm scared they're gonna shoot the dog. And it was dark. And they had me walk up\nand they're all behind me and I knock on the door and\ntell her the police are there and she needs to put the dog up. So she does. And they come in and just\nstart ransacking them to put me in cuffs, set me\ndown, start berating her with questions. She had no idea what\nthe hell was going on. - Were you able to say a word\nor two to help her understand? - Yeah, I was trying to tell her. And at the same time they\ntake a watch off her wrist. They let her keep the ring. They're telling her that I'm\nthis guy, what's my real name? Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang\nacross across the board. - [Lex] So she's probably terrified. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I tell her, I was like, \"Look, they're gonna arraign me tomorrow. Don't come, don't come.\" I said, \"see what's going\non, but don't show up.\" Of course she's there\nthe next morning, her and her dad, and she's\nback in the back crying. They're reading off the charges. I'm under $300,000 bond, everything else. And that's it, they throw me in a cell. Meanwhile, more charges\nkeep coming in, you know, and it's like 10, 12\ncharges a day at that point. And I'm trying to call her\nto make sure she's all right. - [Lex] Does it get through? - So I spent three\nmonths in jail and during that three months she visits twice. I get like three or\nfour phone calls to her. Looking back now I\nunderstand why, you know, back then it was like,\nI'm the victim, you know, why doesn't she talk to me? But now I understand why\nhell the girl loved me too. And then she found out I\nwas this piece of shit. And after a week in county\njail, two agents fly in from New Jersey. Two Secret Service guys\npulled me out of cell, looked at me and they were like,\n\"We got your laptop.\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" And he's like, \"Well, have you\ngot anything on your laptop?\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"You're gonna\nbe charged for it.\" I was like, \"I figured.\" And then he looks at me, he is like, \"Can you do anything for us?\" And I told him my exact words were, \"Look, you let me get back with Elizabeth. I'll do whatever you want me to do.\" And he looks at me, he is like,\n\"We're gonna get you out.\" I was like, \"Alright.\" So they let me sit there for three months (laughs)\nto get a taste of it. And get me out. My sister, they have the bond\nreduced to a thousand dollars. My sister pays the thousand dollars bond. By this point, she's disown me. And because I'm dating the stripper. And Denise bonds me out. The person that I call\nimmediately is Elizabeth, I'm out. And she's like, \"I'll be there.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" So that's\nlike 11 o'clock at night. I'm in the parking lot of the Charleston Police,\nCharleston County jail, me and a Secret Service agent standing there. And Elizabeth had a friend\nthat owned a limo company. So she pulls up in a limo, gets out, pops the trunk, gets these\ntwo plastic containers out that have my clothes in them,\ndrops all the pavement, comes over, hugs me, call me later,\ngets in the car, drives off. I'm sitting there crying like a baby. Agent looks at me, \"Is that\nyour fiance?\" I'm like, \"Yeah.\" And he is like, \"I am so sorry.\" (laughs) And I'm like, \"Yeah.\" (laughs) - She sounds fascinating.\n- Yeah, yeah. - Pull up in a limo. (both laughing) - I had $30 to my name at that point. $30. The agent had to pay for my\nhotel room that first night. So he drops me off after paying for the hotel room, buy\nme something to eat. Soon as he drops me off, I\ntake that $30, walk a half mile to Walmart, buy a prepaid debit card so I can start back in tax fraud. Soon as I get back to the\nhotel room, call Elizabeth, beg her to come see me. She comes to see me and\nwe talk most of the night and convince her to give me a chance. I tell her that \"Hey,\neverything's gonna be all right. They're gonna hire me. I'm\ngonna be this big consultant.\" Lies lies. Just so she get back with\nme and she's like, \"Okay.\" And so we moved from\nCharleston, the field office is in Columbia, South Carolina. And I'm breaking the law even before I start working with 'em. I'm breaking the law. And so they've got me in the\noffice, the field office. They got this big wall room in there. I'm on a laptop, outside\nline, laptops hooked up to a 50 inch plasma monitor on the wall. They've got a desktop\nsitting directly next to me, outside line. Two Secret Service officers in the room at all times with a South\nCarolina law enforcement officer. My job is four to six hours\na day surfing the web, picking up targets, intel, teaching them how cyber crime operates,\neverything else like that. For the first two weeks,\nthey are extremely diligent. They pay attention to\neverything that's going on. Ask questions, everything else. But the problem is, is that\nthat gets boring real quick because I'm very fast online doing that. So they're like, \"What\nthe hell is he doing?\" And it gets tiring looking at\na guy just doing that shit. So after two weeks they get lazy and bored and they start watching\nporn instead of watching me. At the same time, they've got a key logger and they've got Spectra Pro and Camtasia. Key loggers and taking\nsnapshots of everything that I'm doing. It go every night. It goes\non a DVD rom on a spindle. So I'm like, they're not\ngonna go through that shit. So I'm like, \"Fuck it.\" Start breaking law from inside\nthe Secret Service offices while they're in the room. Why not? That continues for 10 months. At the same time, the relationship with Elizabeth fell apart,\ncompletely fell apart. - As it would. Do you have an understanding\nof why it is just because of her heart got\nbroken 'cause there was lying? - [Brett] It was the trust. - She felt like she did a lot.\n- Yeah. - To sacrifice for the\nrelationship you've got. - You got a woman there\nthat she had even said it. She had told one of her friends,\nwe were out having dinner one night, and this was\nbefore I got arrested. She told one of her friends\nthat I was the only guy that ever asked her to stop using drugs. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I have to say that, that part of the story is so powerful. And then that she chose to\ndo it and she chose to stop. - And she told me that\nthere was one instance, she told me that if she didn't marry me, she'd never be married. And as far as I know,\nshe's never been married. - [Lex] And so it started to fall apart there?\n- Yeah. Because I was that piece of shit. - Still, you didn't take a step. By the way, can I just\nsay how just moving it is, how honest you are, but thank you. Thank you for being that person. But at that time you,\nthere's still that lying. - Oh man yeah, yeah, yeah.\nSo it's fallen apart. She wants to start going to strip clubs and I'm like, fuck it,\nwhy not let her, we'll go. So we start gonna strip clubs and she'll come back and be, get wasted and we'll have sex, what have you. And one night she looks\nat me and she was like, she was like, \"I think it'd\nbe funny if you got a blow job from somebody else.\" And that got me, that got me. I was like, to me that was\nthe final straw right there. I was like, she doesn't\ncare for me anymore or anything else like that. We'd been gonna strip clubs. So I started dating another stripper and she knew something was going on and she looks at me one day and she's like, why don't you just\ntell me that it's over? And I looked at her and I\nsaid, it's over. We're done. And I told her, I was like, \"Look.\" I said, \"whatever you want.\"\nWe were renting an apartment. I was like, whatever you\nwant in here, take it. I said, not only that, but\nI'll make sure you got money for several months, so you're all right. And I was like, \"Just leave\nme, you know, leave my TV and leave, leave me some\nplates and stuff. (laughs) So I go to work that day at\nthe Secret Service, come back that night and she's taking\neverything and left a picture of herself in the bedroom on the floor. I'm like, \"Okay, I guess I deserve that.\" - I like her. She's got- - She's cool. She was cool. (laughs) So I'm giving her a thousand dollars like every two weeks for some like this. And it gets to the point, 'cause I'm doing this tax\nfraud from inside the offices. Well, the debit card companies\nare pinging the cards. They start to realize that, hey, some son of a bitch is stealing\nmoney using our debit card. So they start to shut down the cards before I can pull cash out. So I start not to have\nthe money to send to her. And I'm like, so she calls and she's like, look,\nI have to have money. And I was like, \"Well look,\nI'm doing what I can.\" \"You promised money.\" And I was like, \"Look, if\nyou knew what I was doing to get this money, you\nwouldn't be asking that.\" And she was like, \"I need money. My rent's behind a month right now.\" And I'm like, \"Your rent's\nbehind?\" She's like, \"Yeah.\" So I was like, \"Okay.\" So I pick up the phone,\ncall the rental office and I was like, just wanna\nmake sure that you know, I'm sorry I'm behind on the\nrent for this apartment number. Oh no, that rent's paid up three months. It's like, \"Okay, hang\nup. Call Elizabeth back.\" I was like, \"You're behind on the rent.\" And she was like, \"Yeah.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Funny.\" They just said, \"You're\nup on it three months.\" And she gets quiet and she's like, \"Well, you lied to me too.\" And I was like, \"You're right.\" (laughs) \"I did, I did that.\"\n- Yeah. - And I was like, \"but look,\nI can't do it anymore.\" And that's the last time I\nspoke to her right there. What happens is I was breaking\nlaw from inside the offices. I had a buddy that, his name was Sean Mims outta Los Angeles. I had taught him how\nto do tax return fraud. I had told Sean I go missing, right? I go missing for three months. I told him if I ever went\nmissing not to contact me. And so I go missing. Then\nI show back up online. First day he contacts. So he becomes a target and they\nidentify him pretty quickly. At that point he's set\nto be arrested sometime in March of six, that's when\nhe's set to be arrested. Operation Rolling Stone was\nthe name of the operation. Nine people were supposed\nto be arrested that night. So Secret Service goes and\ngoes and arrests this guy. They search his apartment\nand don't find anything. The apartment manager\ncomes out and explains to him how Sean has done all\nkinds of work to the apartment. As a matter of fact, he\nbrought in $30,000 worth of Italian tile to put in the\napartment that he is renting. And by the way, last night\nhe had a U-Haul out here and took out a whole shit\nload of stuff. (laughs) So the Secret Service comes\nback in, they look at me and they're like, \"We need\nyou to take a polygraph.\" And my answer was, \"I\nain't taking a polygraph.\" So they're like, \"Well, we'll throw you\nback in jail if you don't.\" And I was like, \"Call my lawyer. Lawyer\ngets me on the phone.\" He is like, \"You don't have\nto take the polygraph.\" I was like, \"Well good. I'm not going to.\" He's like, \"But they will\nthrow you back in jail.\" And I was like, \"Don't wanna do that.\" And he's like, \"Have you done anything?\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" And he's like, \"Well, you can\ntry to pass the polygraph.\" (laughs) I'm like, \"Okay.\" So I looked at, I was like,\n\"let's take the polygraph.\" They asked three questions. The questions were, have\nyou talked to anybody? Have you been on computer\noutside of the offices? Have you talked to the press? Which I was interviewing with a New York Times\nwriter the entire time. And then have you contacted or warned anybody about investigations? And I failed polygraph completely. So they revoked the\nbond, took me back down to Charleston County, throw me into jail. Three days later, Secret\nService shows back up and pulled me out of a cell. It's Jim Ramone and Bobby Kirby. And they were, I mean,\nhonestly, they were good men and they gave me chances upon\nchances to do the right thing. And I was not ready to do that. And Jim Ramone and Bobby's in there and Bobby, I mean Bobby was a friend. Yeah. I mean he truly was. Later on, a couple years\nago, I had a chance to... A couple years ago, I had\na chance to have lunch with a man and told him I was sorry for everything I did to him. 'cause I got him and him,\nhim and another agent fired and told him I was\nsorry for what happened. And he told me then he is\nlike, we were your friends man. We were truly your\nfriends. So they were good. - They wanted to help.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] They wanted you to be a good man. - Yeah. Yeah. What got me so bad is I told him, I was like, man, I'm trying to be a better guy. - [Lex] Yeah. - And he's like, Brett,\nyou always were a good guy. You just didn't know it. - People like that.\n- Yeah. - We need people like that in this world. - Yeah. - You need somebody to basically believe-\n- Oh man. - That you can be a good man. - So Jim Ramone pulls me out. He's the second in\ncharge in South Carolina. He's got the Miranda Waiver\n(laughs) in front of him. Right? And he looks at me, he is\nlike, I'm playing hard. Bobby's over here looking distraught and you know, like a hurt dog. And Jim's like, here's the\nway this is gonna work. He said, \"You're going to tell me everything you've done the past six years, or I'm gonna make it my mission in life to over you and your family.\" And he said, \"not just this case, once\nyou get outta prison, I'll hound you the rest of your life.\" Then he slides the Miranda waiver over and he is like, \"Now you want to talk.\" And I looked at him and I\nwas like, \"Nope.\" (laughs) He was like, he gets up, gets all red in the face, storms out as on the way out. He is like, \"Fuck you very much.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So I go back to the cell. A week later I was on\nonly under state charges. A week later, Judge rules, they revoke the bond improperly.\n- Wow. - Oh, reinstates the bond. Nobody calls the Secret Service to tell 'em I walk out. I walk out, I was dating the stripper and I told my mom, I was like, \"Well, if they're gonna fuck\nme, they're going to have to find me. (laughs) - Just went on the move. - Yeah, I called this stripper girl up. I'd given her like 60K,\nsome shit like that. And I told her, I was like,\n\"Kim, I need some money.\" And she was like, \"What?\" And I was like, \"Look.\" I said, \"gimme a thousand dollars. I'll give you back $3,000 in two weeks.\" She was like, \"Okay.\" So I met her in Augusta, Georgia and got the thousand from her and started driving west on I-20. No idea where to go to\nanything else. Got to Dallas. There was a prepaid debit\ncard supplier in Dallas. Went in, walked in the\noffice, convinced the guy, social engineering, convinced the guy to gave me 60 prepaid debit cards, without a driver's\nlicense, without payment. Anything else he did.\nAnd that started the run. I ended up stealing from that\nI stole like 160K profit. Used that to buy a Jeep\nCherokee and went on. The idea was to steal enough\nmoney to bug out to Flo Anolis, Brazil, and set up shop\ndown there (laughs) and do it again. - [Lex] That was the dream. - That was it. That was it. So I was on the run for\nfour months, stole $600,000. I was in Las Vegas, Nevadane. The night before. I'd\nstolen 160K out of ATMs. Went in, the next morning\nI woke up, signed on to cardersmarket.com, which was ran by Max Butler, the Iceman. And there's my name US Most Wanted on it. And that gets your attention. It was my real name with the\nUS Most wanted beside of it. Nobody knew my real name\nin that environment at all. But then they did and it was\ntalking about me being part of the Secret Service\nOperation, AnglerPhish, everything else. So of course they're all like- - [Lex] So everybody's after you. - Oh yeah, we're gonna\nget this son of a bitch. So I sat there looking at it and I was like, said it out loud. I was like, \"Well, Mr. Johnson, you've made the United\nStates most Wanted list. What do you do now?\" And I was like, \"I'm going\nto Disney World.\" (laughs) - [Lex] Literally. - Literally, literally said that out loud. So loaded up the Jeep. Drove from Las Vegas to Orlando, Florida and got the two annual passes. One to Disney World, the other\none to Universal Studios. Paid, paid for a timeshare. They were building these new timeshares right off Universal Drive. Building these brand new timeshares, paid for a timeshare nine months, cash. I was like, we take\ncash. Yeah, we take cash. There's $12,900. Then it wasn't furnished. So I went down to a furniture store, bought $30,000 in furniture. They had seized a DVD collection\nof mine worth 30 grand. Bought that back and proceeded to go to\nDisney World every day. And that lasted about six weeks. They used a Trigger Fish\nis what they use nowadays. It's called a Stingray to find me. So one day I was, it was like 10:30 in\nthe morning on Saturday. September 16th was the day 2006. So 2006, September 16th, I was used to the builders coming around, knocking, making sure everything was all right. So I was asleep, heard\nthis, knock at the door and get up, look through the keyhole. Nobody's there. You know the\npee hole, nobody's there. I was like, huh. Open the door. Step out into the hallway,\nwalking down the hall. It was Bobby Kirby,\nanother South Carolina guy and a Orlando Orange County cop. And they turn around,\nthey're like, \"Hey Brett.\" I'm like, \"Hey Bobby, how are you?\" And he's like, \"We're good. How are you?\" And I'm like, \"I'm fine. Would you like to come in?\" And he was like, \"Let's\nput you in cuffs first.\" And I was like, \"That's\nprobably a good idea.\" So he was like, He walks in. - I like those guys. - He was like, \"Have you\ngot anything in here?\" And I was like, \"Yeah, there's\n$120,000 in the bedroom.\" And he was like, \"seriously?\" I was like, \"Yeah, that and\nan AK47.\" His face goes white. And he's like, \"You've got a rifle.\" And I was like, \"No, I'm\nkidding with you.\" (laughs) And he was like, he was like, \"Okay.\" So they throw me in jail in Orange County and they gave me diesel therapy. And diesel therapy is,\nit took like two weeks to transport me from\nOrange County, Orlando to Columbia, South Carolina. And what happens is, is you\nstop at every county jail, you possibly can go\nthrough the processing, which is about six hours. Once you get to your bunk,\nhey, time to transport you. (laughs) - [Lex] They do that on purpose. - On purpose. On purpose.\n- Yes. - Wears you down mentally and\nphysically and everything. I get to Columbia, South Carolina now while\nI was at Orange County, what happens is this inmate, because we were in federal holding. This inmate, he looks at\nme, his name was Yeti. And he is like, \"Hey man, you know, the only time you get\noff in federal prison is the drug program.\" And I was like, \"Well\nman, I don't use drugs.\" And he is like, \"You can find\na drug problem, can't you?\" And I was like, \"I can\nfind a drug problem.\" So what happens is, is\nevery county jail I stop at, on the way to Columbia, I tell him I'm alcoholic and cocaine. So by the time I get to\nColumbia, South Carolina, they've got this paper trail of Mr. Johnson requesting help for drugs. I had hired Strom Thurman's\nson as an attorney. They make me drop him because I paid for him with illegal funds. So they give me a public defender, he gets a psychological\nevaluation ordered for me. So psychologist comes into\ncounty jail, four hour interview. About halfway through, he\nlooks at me, he is like, \"You using any type of drugs?\" And I was like, yeah. He's\nlike, \"What do you use?\" \"Cocaine?\" \"Smoker, snort.\" \"Snort.\" \"How much?\" \"An eight ball a day.\" \"That's a lot.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Do you have any trouble\noutta that?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I can't get an erection.\" And he looks at me and\nI'm looking at him like, 'cause I had gotten that\nshit from Boogie Knights. (laughs) Yeah. So I'm like, \"And finally.\"\nI'm like, \"is that right?\" And he was like, \"It could\nhappen.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" So that makes it into\nmy pre-sentence report. So all federal inmates, probation office and prosecutor, they do this\ndetailed background check to basically tell the judge\nhow much time to give you. All right, so that drug bit with that interview makes it into the PSR. So they have interview,\nI mean day of sentencing. I had pled guilty day of sentencing. The prosecutor, he stands up and this, this dude is\nscreaming at this point. And he's like, \"Mr. Johnson's manipulated\nthe secret surface. He's manipulated the prosecutor.\" Then he points at the judge, \"and he's manipulating\nyou today, your Honor, we insist on the upper\nlimits of the guidelines.\" Well, I had been telling\neverybody in the jail that if they give me any more than 60 months, I am not staying. (laughs) So they're like, \"Okay, sure.\" So the judge looks at me\nand she's like, \"I agree.\" I'm like, and she says, \"75 months.\" So I looked at my lawyer and I was like, \"Can you get the drug program for me?\" He's like, \"I don't know how I'll ask.\" So he stands up, \"Your Honor, will you\norder the drug program for Mr. Johnson.\" The judge says, \"No, but I'll\nrecommend he gets evaluated.\" So the Secret Service had told her, \"Hey, he's full of shit.\" - [Lex] Yeah. - So she's like, \"No, but I'll recommend he gets evaluated.\" I looked at my lawyer and I was like, \"What does that mean?\" He was like, \"You're\nprobably not gonna get it.\" And I was like, \"How soon\ncan you get me to the camp?\" And he was like, \"Well,\nif you don't appeal, I can get you there pretty quick.\" My exact words were, \"Fuck the\nappeal, get me to the camp. I'll take it from there.\" He looks at me like, I'm the\nbiggest idiot in the world. I get sent to 'cause you\ncan get a camp recommended. I have friends, family\nmembers look for camps that don't have a fence around them. And we settle on Ashland, Kentucky. Six weeks later I'm at Ashland, Kentucky and pull up there, 14 foot\nfence, raise a wire on top. And I'm like, I don't climb\nfences. So like go in. First question I ask\nis, are there any jobs outside of the fence? And he was like, guard's like, \"Well you can work in\nthe national forest.\" And I'm like, \"No, I'll die out there.\" And he was like, \"Well\nyou could do landscaping.\" I'm like, \"I could run\na weed eater.\" (laughs) So two days later I walk\ninto the landscaping office and the cop, this is this genius of some of these people and institutions,\nthe cop behind his desk, the entire wall is a blown\nup photo of the compound and the outlying area. So I can literally sit there\nand plot where I'm going. Alright. My dad, I hadn't spoken\nto that man in years. And he shows up at my sentencing and stands up in front of the judge. And he is like, \"Your Honor, I wanna make\nsure Brett gets a good start. He can live with me when he\ngets out. Everything else.\" Looking back, the man meant that. And I just thought it\nwas bullshit at the time. So he starts to visit me in\nprison. I mean, yeah, in prison. He starts to visit and about\nthe third visit in, he looks at me, he is like, \"I've been reading about you online.\" I was like, \"Yeah.\" He is like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"That's a\nlot of money you made.\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"You think you can teach\nsomebody how to do that?\" (laughs) And I'm like, so what I used to say, and it again that it's this\nthing of, really coming to terms with things. What I used to say was, is\nI thought my dad was back in my life and that he\nwas just trying to use me. Alright. The truth of the matter is that my dad hadn't\nreally seen me except in that frame of crime, you\nknow, being that criminal with my mom, everything else. And I really think that's\nhow the man was trying to communicate with me. - He wanted to connect with you\nin the places where you love or you're interested in. - [Brett] Right. - Where your addiction is essentially. - Right, and what I did\nis I manipulated the man into helping me escape. So I agreed to teach\nhim how to do tax fraud. And in return, he had\nthe only money he had to his name, he had $4,000 cash. So I manipulated him and he given me that. And to dropping me off a\nchange of clothes, a cell phone and a driver's license. The only driver's license he had was my driver's license, Brett Johnson. So I was at the camp for, I\ndon't know, six, eight weeks. And the hardest worker that\nlandscaping had ever seen. (laughs) At one point the cops\ngot me on a mountainside with a broom sweeping off the mountain. I'm like, \"Yeah, we'll\ndo that. Absolutely.\" - [Lex] You're building\ntrust of the guys there. - Yeah. Working my ass off. Yeah. And at the end, six weeks I take off and I lasted, I think two, three\nweeks, something like that. US Marshals, I made it a hundred take off.\n- You escaped. - Escaped.\n- Escaped. Escaped US Marshals. They're canvassing a three state area. They find me, I think 250 miles away. It's like Lexington, Kentucky. They find me in Lexington because I had to use my real driver's license. I had a laptop, I had prepaid debit cards and I had stolen identity information. And kind of what the way it\ngot me was I had dyed my hair this flaming red, you\nknow, I had this deep tan. I didn't look anything like myself. And I was at a hotel, had the\ncurtains open, saw this guy. I was on the laptop, saw\nthis guy walk by, he walks by the window and he stops. And then he backs up. He looks inside, he knocks on the window. I look up at him, he is like, \"You.\" I was like \"Me.\" And he's like, \"You.\" Then he pulls out this badge\n(laughs) and he points at it. He's like, and then he\npoints at the door, \"Now.\" So I was like, \"Oh, okay.\" So I open up the door and he\nis like US Marshal Service. So they arrest me. - [Lex] How did they track you down? - They canvassed that area. They talked to every hotel,\neverything else I had- - It's like a traditional,\nlike they were traditional. - Police work is what it was. - So it wasn't like from the internet, they kind\nof got something. I dunno. - Just straight good, good,\ngood, good police work. - [Brett] Parcels are outstanding.\nYeah, everything they do. So they arrest me. I go to a, I'm initially held at a county\njail in Moorhead, Kentucky. And that man, that was one\nhell of an experience there. But then I'm transferred\nafter sentencing on that. So sentencing, here's the weird thing. So I spent like, I think two or three months at the county\njail in Morehead, Kentucky. Get sentenced at my sentencing,\nit happens so quickly after the initial sentencing that they use the exact\nsame pre-sentence report. The report that's got all\nthat drug shit in there. So at my sentencing prosecutor's there, Secret Service is there. Judge me and my attorney,\nprosecutor stands up. He's like, \"Your Honor, we would like it if you would consider that\nwhen Mr. Johnson was arrested, he had a laptop, he had all\nthis information with him. Looks like he was engaged in\nidentity theft, yet again.\" Judge looks at the prosecutor, says \"No.\" Says, \"Hey, if you were gonna charge him with it, you should have\ncharged him with it. I'm only considering the escape.\" Then he looks at me and he's\nlike, \"Mr. Johnson,\" he said, \"it looks like by you keeping\nyour mouth shut right now, you're really saving yourself\na pretty serious charge.\" And my response was, \"Yes, your Honor.\" And he was like, \"Then he opens\nup the pre-sentence report and he's fingering through and he's like, \"It also looks like before you got involved\nwith all these drugs, you were a pretty good citizen.\" I was like, \"Yes, your Honor.\" And he's like, \"so here's\nwhat I'm gonna do.\" He said, \"I'm gonna give you\n18 months on the escape.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" He said, I'm also gonna give you, no, it was 15 months on the escape. He said, \"I'm gonna give you\n15 months on the escape.\" He said, \"and I'm also going to order the drug program for you.\" I was like, \"Yes, your honor.\" So the drug program gives you a year off and it gives you six\nmonths and halfway house. So by escaping, I got outta prison three months earlier than what\nI should have gotten outta. - So the original thing about drugs worked in long.\n- It worked. - Now the interesting thing with that, and this is the best\nlie I ever told, honestly, the best lie I ever told, I spent eight months in solitary\nconfinement. Eight months. And that's an experience (laughs) because you ain't got no books\nfor the first month or so. Then they give you a King James Bible.\n- Bible. - Yeah and then-\n- For a month not books. This is a pretty small-\n- Six by nine room. - Six by nine.\n- Yeah. - No books.\n- No books. No paper, no pen, no pencil. - You are alone with your mind. - [Brett] You got a mat, a toilet. - What's that like? - It's, you sleep as much as you can. You're sleeping 16, 18 hours\na day is what you're doing. - Were you thinking about\neven just going back to like Elizabeth-\n- Oh, you go through all that. The whole thing through all that. Every bit.\n- Your mom too? - Yeah, you're going through\nevery single bit of that. And so you're supposed\nto get out an hour a day. Law says you're supposed\nto get out an hour a day. That's the law. That's not the\nway things actually happen. What actually happens is, is you're lucky to get out an hour a week. You take a shower twice\na week and that's it. You get a phone call once a month. - - [Lex] Oh. So you\ndon't get to see nature. - Don't see anything. You're\nin solitary, all right? And it takes about a week. The\nfirst week is the roughest. You're bouncing off the\nwalls that first week. 'Cause you can't sleep,\ncan't do anything else. Then you start to adapt\nto it after a while. When that book does arrive,\nyou're happy as hell to have it. I'm well versed (laughs)\nin the King James Bible. So you're happy to have it. Then finally, you get\nother books that come in from that point. Spent eight months that, and they send me out to a real prison. Big Spring Texas, West Texas. Where have you been out there? - [Lex] No. - Man, I could tell Prairie Dogs and tarantulas.\n- Yeah. - Is what it is. It got no kidding. It gets so hot, that warnings come on the radio telling you not\nto drive on certain streets because they're melted. That's Big Spring.\n- Oh. - So if you've seen the\nmovie, \"From Dusk till Dawn\", the opening scene is in Big Spring, Texas.\n- It's hot. - Yeah, very hot. So, and that's where I find\nout what a real prison is. And it's not ran by guards.\nPrisons are ran by inmates. And that's a fact. So you're met at the door by whatever race you are is what happens. So Big Spring is a converted\nAir Force compound. It's a disciplinary prison. So you get the bad guys that are in there. So I get, (chuckles) I\ngo through processing and I'm walking up to the unit and I met at the door by\na guy named Nick Sandifer. He's the treasurer of\nthe Aryan Brotherhood. And first question out of his mouth is anymore\nwhite guys come in? And, I didn't know, I was like, \"Hell, I don't know, four or five.\" Next question is, \"What\nare you in here for?\" My answer was, 'cause I'm\nlike, I ain't got no worries. My answer was, \"Computer\ncrime.\" Smiled at him. (laughs) And it turns out wrong thing to say, because computer crime\nis not credit card theft or hacking or any bullshit like that. Computer crime in prison\nis child pornography. So tell him that he looks at\nme like I'm a piece of shit. Goes and gets his buddies. They circle around, \"What\nare you in here for?\" - I like how the Aryan\nBrotherhood has like lines. They're like-\n- Oh yeah. (laughs) This child porn.\n- That's it. That's the bad guy. - They circle around, they're like, \"What'd you say you're in here for?\" So I'm sitting there trying\nto explain it to 'em. They're like, \"You know,\nyou tell a good story. You still said this.\" - Now computer crime basically, really does mean usually\nchild pornography? - In prison, yeah. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. And what you see, and that's\none of the things you find out that the guys that are going\nin there for child porn, they will tell 'em it's credit card theft.\n- Right. - So yeah.\n- Right. They've learned. - So I'm that guy that's-\n- But you also don't, I mean for people who are just listening to this, you don't exactly look like the typical computer hacker. (Brett laughs) - That's true. That's true\n(laughs) that's very true. But I don't look like\nthe pedophile either. - That's right. That's right. But it's like, it doesn't\nmake it seem like you're, I mean, I guess you're not wearing\na hoodie and you're not like Emo dark, you know? - The way it actually works in prison, they won't attack\nyou until they know, all right? So they have to see paperwork, which now in federal prison you\ndon't get transported with paperwork because of that. So they have to see paperwork or a guard will tell them\nwhat you're in there for. Guards will tell who the pedophiles are. So none of the guards told\n'em that I was anything. So for the first month they think I am, but they're not doing anything 'cause they don't know for sure. At the end of the first\nmonth, I'd been talking to Kevin Poulsen over at Wired\nMagazine about Max Butler. He does an article about that\nshows up in Wired Magazine. So at the end of the first month, Wired Magazine hits compound front cover. That's all the story.\n- That saved you. - You would think. You\nwould think it's saved me. So I'm reading the article.\nReally happy about it. So what happens is, is\nfour o'clock is mail call, four o'clock's a standup count nationwide after four o'clock is your mail call, they hand out all the mail for the day. So the mail comes, I get the magazine, I'm like reading through it. I'm like, well shit, I'm good to go. Then it says Brett Johnson,\n\"Secret Service informant,\" in the article. - [Lex] So you're now a snitch? - Which is right up there\nwith the pedophiles. (laughs) So we go to dinner after that. At dinner, you can hear\nit, you can hear the chat. We gotta snitch it. We,\nI think it's that guy. There we go.\n- Yeah. - Warden next day shuts\ndown the entire compound. Calls me into his office. They got security there,\nhe got the counselors there and everything else. Warden looks at me, he is like, \"Did you give an interview\nto Wired Magazine?\" I'm like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"Do you not know\nthey will kill you in here?\" He was like, \"Do you feel safe?\" Well I know if you tell\n'em you don't feel safe, they transport you, transport\nyou means another eight months in solitary confinement. You start to see shit in solitary after a while.\n- Yeah. So I'm like, \"No, I'm not gonna do that.\" So I'm like, \"completely\nsafe.\" He was like, \"Look.\" He's like, \"if anybody says anything to you immediately come to us because they'll fucking kill you.\" So they do a locker search, try to confiscate the magazines, they can't. The next day I walk into the unit, there's Nick Sanderford laying on his bunk magazine wide open reading it. I'm like, oh shit. Walked up to him. I was like, \"Hey Nick,\nwhat are you doing?\" He is like, \"Oh, doing some reading.\" I was like, \"Anything interesting?\" He is like, \"It's getting there.\" (laughs) I was like, \"Let me save you the trouble.\" Take the magazine, turn\nit over to the page. I was like, \"Right there is\nwhat you're looking for.\" He was like, \"Man, I already knew.\" I was like, \"Do we have a problem?\" And he looks at me, he is like, \"Is anyone on the compound you told on?\" I was like, \"No.\" He's like, \"Until someone gets here\nyou snitched on we're okay.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" He's like, \"But I need you\nto do something for me.\" All right, so in federal\nprison, you gotta have a job. Everybody works. Doesn't matter what you\ndo, but you gotta work. I got a job in education\nteaching a lit class every Wednesday, 6:00 to 8:30 PM lit and had every area on\nthe compound signs up for the lit class. Had a couple guards every\nnow and then popped in and did we teach lit? No, we taught fraud\nevery Wednesday, (laughs) 6:00 to 8:30 PM and that's how\nI didn't get my ass beaten. And my other job, I\nhad two jobs with them. The other job, you get to\nthe point, it's weird, man. You get to the point, people\nwalking off the bus, you know, immediately two groups of people, you know who the bank robbers are, immediately just by them walking off the bus, you're like, \"That mother fucker is a bank robber.\" And you know who the\npedophiles are immediately. So my job as the white guy was to approach the white pedophiles\nand have a conversation and the conversation was basically, \"Hey, don't know what you're in here for. Don't care what you're in for, but if you got some sort\nof fucked up charge, you need to tell me. If you tell me everything's\ngonna be all right. If you don't tell me, you\nsee those guys over there. If you start to associate with 'em or they start to talk to you and then they find out you're in here on something, they're going to kill you.\" - [Lex] And what are\nthe things, pedophile. - Pedophile, rapist, anything that harms children, harms\nwomen, anything like that. - So it's like the mob, there's rules, there's an ethical code. Even if you have the\ndivision between races on all that, you still\nhave these lines drawn. - And what that looks-\n- And this hierarchy too. - Very much so. And what that looks like\nin prison, it depends on the security class that\nyou're in, what level prison. But at that prison, what that looked like was you're not\nallowed to talk to anybody. You're not allowed to watch television. You can go to the library. You don't associate with\nanyone except your own type. If you do anything like\nthis, we will kill you. If someone wants to extort\nyou, we will do that too. And you won't tell on\nus or we'll kill you. So that's the way that\nworks at that point. - [Lex] And everybody quickly learns this. - Quickly. Quickly. And so typically the guys would say, I just wanna do my own time. That would be the line. And it's like, okay, don't\nmess with him. Alright? Every now and then\nyou'd have somebody lie. And that would come with\nthose types of consequences. I got to see, while I was\nthere, saw two people murdered, went through three prison riots and through my entire tenure\nin prison, saw four suicides. The people who got killed, so we had a outside, you\nhad this track, a third of a mile track, you\nwalk at counter clockwise and inside of the track you\ngot two handball courts. So of an evening. It happened both times. All of us would be walking,\nyou know, doing our exercises. And at the top of the key, like a flock of birds, you'd\nsee all the inmates start to migrate down toward the gate. So the first time you see that, you see that migration, you\nlook up in the distance and that one inmate's\ngot another inmate down and he is just hammering his\nhead right into the pavement. Like that right there. Well guards don't stop that\nbecause a guard may get hurt. So a guard is 15 minutes\ncoming out to stop that until everything's over. By that point, the guy\ndoesn't have a head. They shut the compound down\nand this is what happens. So you shut the entire compound down. They make two lines of the inmates. And what happens is the inmate walks into a room, they shut the door behind. The inmate guard asks 'em two questions. First question is, did you see\nanything? The answer is no. Second question is, if\nyou had seen anything, would you say anything? Answer is no. Guard then\nsays, \"Get the fuck out.\" And that's it. Anybody that stays in any longer than that is automatically suspect. So there was one incident, I\nremember this Hispanic guy, he's in there for a few\nminutes and everybody's like, what's going on? (laughs) So his people then call him over, explain to us what went on?\n- Yeah. - And it happens like that. - It's fascinating that because you talked about\nthe network of trust in the cyber crime community.\n- Oh yeah. - And here's a network of trusts-\n- Absolutely. - In the prison crime community. - [Brett] Absolutely. - And trust.\n- Trust matters. - Trust drives everything\nat the end of the day. The riots that I went\nthrough, the first riot, man, you're scared to\ndeath, scared to death. You know, you've got the cops dressed up in the ninja turtle outfits. You've got the rubber bullets, the tear gas canisters, all that crap. You got the inmates that are\nraising hell, scared to death. The second riot, you calm down. Second riot, you start to\nnotice this is racial riot. This is typically, and almost always it's\nHispanics and African Americans. - [Lex] So you you get to detect what is the motivation for\nthe riot, what's the reason? - That's exactly right. - [Lex] And that gives you some calm. - That's exactly right. So second riot, you start to notice this, Hey man, this ain't me,\nthis ain't our group. - [Lex] Yeah. - Third riot, no shit. Third riot, you lay in your bunk (laughs) and you let 'em wage war all around you. And every now and then you\nhave an inmate, they'll run up to you and they'll point to a locker and say, is that your locker? And if you tell 'em yes,\nthey leave it alone. If you say it's not my\nlocker, they'll break into it and steal everything out\nof it and go from there. And that's what happens. - [Lex] So you did your\ntime for five years? - Five and a half. - [Lex] Five and a half. You made it out. - Made it out, I went through the, I told you it was a good\nlie that I told, I went through the residential\ndrug abuse program. It's a nine month intensive therapy. And the way I got to that, this counselor at Big Spring, he bought\nthis, he wanted inmates to be educated, he was a really good guy. So he wanted inmates to be educated. He got a discount on a\ngame theory class set. So he gets all these\ndisc good and everything and he's asking, does anybody on the compound know\nanything about game theory? And somebody says, if anybody\ndoes, it'll be Brett Johnson. (laughs) So he comes up to me one day at my bunk, he's like, \"Are you Brett\nJohnson?\" I was like, \"Yeah.\" He was like, \"Do you know\nanything about game theory?\" And I was like, \"Yes I do.\" (both laughing) So I start rattling off prisoners' dilemma and everything else. He's like, \"Will you teach a class?\" So I start teaching that. I start teaching inmates, public speaking and to make friends with this counselor. So it gets time where I'm supposed to be transferring out\nto this drug program that they only had in Fort Worth. And the transfers are taking\nlike four or five months. And that's four or five\nmonths I could be out free. So I went up to him one day and I was like, \"Look.\"\nHis name was Keely. I was like, \"Look man.\" I said, \"is there any way that I can get transferred\nout any sooner?\" And he looks at me, he is like,\n\"Brett, I cannot help you.\" And I was like, \"I appreciate that, thank you so much for even trying.\" So he said that a week later I'm on a bus by going to Fort Worth.\n- Got it? - Yeah.\n- I love it. - So it was a nine month program, 24 hours a day of cognitive\nbehavioral therapy. It had nothing to do with drugs. It was all peer study\nstuff and CBT training. And honestly, it's the best thing that could ever happen, truly is. - Oh, that part. What was the thing that\nchanged you as a man? Is it the solitary\nconfinement? Was it the years? Was it losing the people you loved? Or was it that behavioral therapy? - It's a combination,\nman. It's a combination. So my sister disowns me. The only person I had\nin my life, I mean, me and my sister, that's it. You know, I mean, yeah, I loved Elizabeth. I love my wife now, but you\nknow, it's me and my sister. We went through all that shit together. So Denise disowns me,\nshe doesn't talked to me for an entire year when\nall this stuff happens. And after I get arrested on the escape, she ends\nup driving seven hours to come see me, to tell me she loves me and I don't see her again\nfor five and a half years. Yeah.\n- Yeah. - So that's really the first turnaround. Took me two and a half years in prison to accept responsibility. Two and a half. - That was amazing that she did that.\n- Yeah. - Because she drove down.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] She did that. - Yeah, she's something. She's something. She saw me for 10 minutes,\ntell me she loves me and then I don't see her. - [Lex] Planted the seed. (laughs) - Yeah. Yeah. - But yeah, you had time\nto think over those years. - Yeah, took two and a\nhalf years to realize that, you know, I didn't commit crime because of stripper\ngirlfriends or wives or family. I committed it 'cause\nI wanted to, chose to. And that's the first turnaround. Second turnaround is like\nthe CBT training, you know, that it didn't really hit\nwhile I was in prison. You know, I went through it\nand they ingrained it in you, but until you choose to make\nit work, it doesn't work. So I got out in 2011, didn't\nwanna break the law. Did not. And I was under three years probation, couldn't touch a computer. I had a job offer from Deloitte to run a cyber crime office in the UK. Which that was a no,\nnow you're not moving. And that's a computer idiot. (chuckles) - [Lex] Yeah. - Then had a job offer from\nno, before a fishing company. Couldn't take that. Got to where I was trying\nto apply for fast food jobs. That's a computer. Can't touch that. Okay? Then what about a waiter's position? Well, that's a computer and\naccess to credit cards. Idiot. Can't touch that either. So literally could not\nget a job, could not. Doing food stamps. I had a roommate that\npaying half the rent. They tell you when you leave prison to get a job in something you care about and you won't recidivate\ncouldn't get a job. And what I had was a cat\n(laughs) it's a Monster, the cat that was the cat's name.\n- That's a good name. - Yeah, I had enough money\nto feed that little guy and didn't have money to buy\ntoilet paper for the apartment. I was on Panama City Beach. - [Lex] How long were\nyou living like this? - It was a steady decline 'cause remember I taught my dad how to commit tax fraud.\n- Yeah. - So he bankrolled a lot\nof that until he couldn't. And then from there it's\nlike, what the fuck do you do? So I didn't wanna go into\ncomputer crime at all. And I ended up shoplifting\ntoilet paper, man. Shoplifting toilet paper. - Just like for the basics?\n- Yeah. - The basics of survival. - So about the same time, I\nhad a friend that (laughs) this guy, I had been dating the same type of women I had been dating. You know these-\n- Yeah. - You know the unhealthy ones, the hot unhealthy ones.\n- Yes. - And (laughs)\n- Love. - Yeah.\n- That's how that works. - Yeah, so I had a\nfriend post an ad for me on Plenty of Fish. And this woman responds,\nmy wife, she responds. And the pictures I had taken were these prison type pictures. You know, the serious like-\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - They were there. And she sends me a message\nof, \"Why aren't you smiling?\" And my response was,\n\"That is my happy face.\" So we start talking and we started dating and she's that second saving thing man. I ended up moving in with\nher. I was going broke. I was about to get kicked\noutta the apartment and everything else. And she didn't say it,\nbut I think she knew it and moved in with her and I got a job. And the job, I got my probation officer to let me have a cell phone. I was going through Craigslist. This guy was advertising for\nlandscaping. Called him up. His name was Dustin Ramos, called him up and he is like, \"Come\non down, talk to me.\" So he was running this business. Him and his brother were out of his house. So I'm sitting there talking\nto him for about 20 minutes. He looks at me, he is like,\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" I was like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"Are you on the\nrun or something?\" (laughs) So I'm like, \"No, why?\" And he is like, \"Well, you just don't look like the kind of guy that do this.\" So I told him, I was like, \"This is who I am, is what I've done.\" And he looks at me, he is like, \"Man, I gotta think about that.\" So he tells me, go on\nhome. That was a Friday. Sunday evening. He gives me a call and\nhe was like, \"Brett.\" He is like, \"If I hire you,\nwill you actually work?\" And I told him, I was like, \"Dustin, if you'll gimme a job, I promise I'll work my ass off.\" And he is like, \"Show up six o'clock.\" I was like, \"Alright.\" So my job was to push a\nlawnmower 10 hours a day, five days a week for $400\na week and busted my ass. I hit it so hard, I had\ncome in end of a night and pass out, wake up the\nnext morning and hit it again. And it got to the point he ended up, this dude ended up offering me to come in, a partner with his business. His brother dropped out and by that point, I'd learned everything on\nthe business and everything. And he was like, you know, \"If you'd like to come\nin, I'll cut you in half.\" And I was like, \"Dustin,\nI can't do it, man.\" Because I wasn't making any money wanted, he didn't wanna pay me anymore until, you know, he was able to do more. And I thought I found another\njob doing something else. And in a speech, I say, it got cold and the grass stopped growing. The truth of the matter was, is I thought I found another job. A guy was offering to pay me\n$1,500 a week doing the sales for oil rig training, was what it was. And I accepted the job. I quit working for Dustin and the guy, before he even offered me the job, I told him what I, you\nknow, my criminal history 'cause I was required to do that. So I was supposed to start work. Well, he calls me and\ntells me he can't hire me. So I'm outta work and Dustin's already hired\nsomebody else by that point. So I can't go back with him. And I'm that guy again,\nman, it's important for me to show value in a relationship. All right? So Michelle\nwas the only one working. I'm like, I gotta do something.\nAnd I get it in my head. I was like, you know\nwhat, if nothing else, I can just bring food in the house. She was only making that. I think, I mean we were headed hard, you know, it was just her working. And I was like, and nothing else. I can bring food in the house and get on the dark web, (laughs) get some stolen credit cards.\n- Yeah. - Start ordering food. Well,\nit gets worse than that. She's got two sons there, so I'm like, well they need clothes. So he starts stealing clothes\nand it continues like that. I get arrested, I get\narrested on a food order and Michelle didn't know what I was doing. So she had been to work and she was coming back from work. I get arrested and I'm like,\nthey let me make a phone call and I call her and I was like, \"Come to police station.\nI've been arrested.\" And she shows up and she didn't\nknow I'd been doing that. My probation officer,\nof course he didn't know or anything else at my\nsentencing for that. Probation officer was there,\nprosecutor, the judge, US Marshals, Michelle and me. Michelle stands up and she tells the judge\nthat I'm a better dad to her kids than their actual father is. And by that point I'm crying. Probation officer stands\nup and he was like, \"We think Mr. Johnson's a good guy. We think this is a one time thing.\" Prosecutor says the same thing. Judge sentences me to one year. Probation officer stands back up and he is like, \"Judge, if you can give Mr. Johnson a year and a day, he can get the good time and get back to his family center.\" So the judge amends a\nsentence to a year and a day. So I served 10 months,\nthey send me back to Texas and that's when I find out\nthat Michelle didn't need me for what I could give her. She just wanted me for\nme that entire time. She stands by me the entire\ntime I do my 10 months get out, we get married after that\nand they kill probation so I can touch a computer. They tell you, they tell you, (laughs) they were like, you know, \"Inmates, a felon. If nothing\nelse, he can sell cars.\" Well it turns out you can't. You can sell cars if you're a drug dealer, if you're the guy that\nsteals all the money in people's information, no fuck no. You can't get a job selling\ncars. So can't get a job. Cannot. And to this day, Lex, I\nknow what my triggers are. I know what it would take to get me back into committing crime. So, and I knew I'd go\nso far at that point. So I looked at Michelle and I was like, \"Lemme see what I can do.\" Signed on to LinkedIn, reached out to this FBI super cop named Keith Mularski outta the Pittsburgh office. He was involved with my arrest and some associates and everything else and sent him a message. And the message was, you know, hey, I respect everything you did. Think you did a great job. By\nthe way. I'd like to be legal. And dude responded within two hours, two hours he gives me\nreferences, advice, takes me in under his wing,\neverything else like that. And from that point, man, it was the head of the identity theft\ncouncil did the same thing. Card not present group hires me to speak, Microsoft hires me to consult with them. And the Microsoft hire\nestablished enough trust in the industry that I was\nall right from that point. - So now you're helping in\nmany ways, fight the very guy that you used to be.\n- Yeah. - So big picture advice,\ngiven that you were that guy, how do we\nfight cyber crime today and in the next 5 years, 10\nyears, 20 years, 50 years? What advice do you have to\nindividuals, to companies, to governments of what\nand also to Elizabeth? (Brett laughs) Like the humans, human\nbeings that love, that live, that are friends with cyber criminals. - There's so many lessons\nto really be had from that. You know, to me, the lesson,\none of the big lessons to me is you can't serve two masters. You know, if you're that\nguy that is committing crime or that person that's\naddicted or you're in love with somebody that's addicted or has that they don't love you, they love that addiction that comes first. It's always gonna come first. So you have to realize\nthat, you have to know when you gotta know when\nto cut somebody off, when to end something that knowing that they're not gonna change\nuntil they decide to change. At the same time, you gotta realize that the only reason I was\nable to turn my life around is because people took that chance on me.\n- Yeah. - You know, that's really the only reason. - [Lex] They believe that\nthere's a good person in there. - Yeah, if Mularski hadn't responded, if I hadn't had my sister,\nmy wife, these companies that initially gave me that chance, my ass would be back\nin prison for 20 years. I have no doubt about\nthat at all. Alright. So you have to realize\nthat, you know, cyber crime, a lot of companies that I talked to, they don't really understand the, or appreciate that networking aspect that that trust aspect of how\ncriminals establish trust with each other, how they work together. A lot of companies think\nthat it's a single player that's out victimizing them. And when you really break\ndown how cyber crime operates, that you've got a group of individuals that are working together to\nhit you, but not only hit you, but they share and exchange\ninformation freely. You know, companies don't do that. You've got privacy concerns, you've got competitive edge\nconcerns, everything else. Companies don't share\ninformation across the board, like criminals do, criminals do that. You have to appreciate that. You have to understand that big statistic, that 90% of their attacks\nuse known exploits. It's not the stuff we don't know about. It's the shit we do know about, we're not doing anything about. - So the way to defend\nagainst cyber crime is like there's a lot of low hanging fruit that you should fix.\n- That a lot of that. A lot of that. - So a lot of basic stuff\nthat's already vulnerabilities. Update the system security. - Yeah. Now that doesn't take care of SolarWinds.\n- Right? - Or CNAP or anything like that. It doesn't but those instances, I mean that okay, that's a big\ninstance. (chuckles) But I mean it is. - But in the full spectrum of-\n- Right. - Especially in the future\nbecause there's more and more companies that are coming online.\n- Right. - They're becoming digital and\nthat it's just more and more and more and those vulnerabilities\nin terms of human nature. So for social engineering and\nthe actual outdated systems, all of it, some of it I guess is the, I mean you're exceptionally good at this is educating on the social engineering side-\n- Right. - Is educating people in companies that- - You've got to do that. And companies have to, you know, I made that point that they never\nreport to law enforcement. That's companies and individuals.\n- Yeah. - You know, I've worked\nwith Fortune 50 companies that will not press charges. Instead, they'll have that insider or that criminal sign, an\nNDA, they'll pay 'em off and we won't mention this shit anymore. You have to press charges, you have to report, you have to raise the awareness of everyone in the group. It's that idea and I've\ntalked about that before of understanding your place\nin that cyber crime spectrum. The way a criminal will victimize\nyou depends on who you are and what you do as a\nperson and as a business. So you have to understand that\ndesign security around that. You know, we've got 7,500\nsecurity companies out there. A whole lot of them\nare snake oil salesman. A lot of 'em, it's going to tell you that we're the one stop solution. But you're not, you're not,\nyou're a tool. Alright? And you may have a very good tool, but it's not the only tool that's needed to protect against the\nattacks that are out there. And we have to be open and\nhonest about that kind of stuff. We're not. - So I guess defense is\nnot just like one tool. It's a process of just like a diversity and just constant educating people.\n- Absolutely. - So it's the social\nside, it's constantly, 'cause there's so many\nprobably attack vectors in terms of the software that you have. - If you look at it, that attack surface. You can't plug everything. It's too damn large to plug everything. But you can do the best\njob you can possibly do. But it takes a variety of\ntools to do that. Alright. The idea and ARCOS is big about that. But the idea is to take the cost of fraud to the fraudster so high\nthat they basically try to pick another target, alright? And that's the idea that\nyou want, you want it to be not worth the criminal's\ntime to hit your company. - What about white hat hacking? So like, you know, hacking for\ngood sort of testing systems and then giving companies\nthe vulnerabilities as you find that. - I think it's outstanding. I do. I think that, I think pen\ntesting white hat stuff is outstanding, I truly do. I think that that you have to. It has to be tempered with\nwhat is reality as well though. All right? You know, we've got a whole\nindustry of of people who try to sell our fit wallets that I don't know of many our fit hackers out\nthere on the criminal side, to be honest with you. (laughs) - Yeah, so some of it's just like a psychological safety blanket that's not actually\nproviding any protection. By the way you wrote on\nLinkedIn something about ID.me. (Brett laughs) What is it? Why is it a problem? I was going down a rabbit hole with-\n- I was wondering if you were gonna mention that. I guess I was partially responsible for them losing an $86 million contract. - What was the contract with?\n- IRS. - [Lex] The government. So what is it? - So ID.me is an identity... Okay backtrack, ID.me\nis a marketing company that wants to say they're an\nidentity verification company. - [Lex] I just wanna bring\nthis up to see you get angry. (Brett laughs) - Okay. I'll tell you what my issue is. - [Lex] Yeah. - My issue is so-\n- So yeah. Yeah. It's a company that's\nused for authentication by the IRS, I guess- - Well IRS, Social\nSecurity administration VA at one point 23, state\nunemployment offices, few other services. - So I guess the idea is\nthat you would be able to unlock your account\nor authenticate yourself as a human being by using your face or something like that-\n- Yeah. - Or private information. - They've got a tiered\nsystem by the verification. They've got a free system, which is questionable\nwhere you submit an ID and it's been shown,\nseveral bypasses been shown. And I don't wanna talk about\ntheir security horribly bad because I wanna be\nhonest, there are bypasses for a lot of security systems out there.\n- Right. - All right? The issue that I have with ID.me is that their policies are\nsomewhat questionable. I don't care if you're a private company that has those policies in place, but if you're a government agency and you as a citizen are\nentitled to a benefit or a service of that government agency and then the government agency forces you to give up your complete identity profile to a private company and then\nthat private company uses that profile for marketing purposes to further profit, things like that. I have a huge issue with that. I don't care if you're a\nprivate company that does that. I just don't think that citizens need to be forced into doing that in order to get a benefit or service that they're entitled to.\n- Yeah. - So that's my big issue. - So I mean, given how much value, how much we talked about\nthe value of identity, you don't think that should\nbe handed over lightly? - No, absolutely not. And who would've thought\nthat Brett Johnson would ever become a privacy advocate? (laughs) But here I am. (Lex chuckles) I mean, it's just people don't understand or appreciate the value of who they are. You know? And certainly you've\ngot a host of companies, ID.me means not the only one, but you've got some of these companies that say, well, we strip out\nthe PII of the individual, we're just using the biometrics and the sites they're\nvisiting and things like that. That's identity, you can still ping that one unique individual\nout of all using that information, stripping\nout the PII you can still ping who that individual is. - So having lived a life\nof crime for many years, I'm sure you've connected\nindirectly to a large number of very dangerous people. - [Brett] Indirectly\nand directly. (laughs) - Yeah. But the network indirectly\nis is even larger, right? - [Brett] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. - I apologize for this\nquestion, are you ever worried for your life or your wellbeing? Like having seen a world\nthat's really dangerous in ways that operates in the shadows. - You know, like I said,\nwhen we started ShadowCrew and started that initial\ncyber crime business, that world, violence wasn't\nthere, it came in later. Now violence is inherent in the system to do the Monty Python\nbit, it's part of it. - [Lex] Yeah, the mob, the mafia are now part\nof this whole thing. - Cartels are part of it.\n- Yeah. - Drugs are inherently in intertwined in cyber crime marketplaces\nbecause of the profit potential. And with that comes a\nlot of violence as well. - Yeah, the cartels have\nalready brought the violence that they're good at\nfrom the 20th century. - [Brett] Absolutely. Absolutely. - Into the technology of the 21st century. - Now do I worry about that? It's interesting that my\nfamily worries about that. All right? I think I may be just too involved in it to appreciate that type of danger. But my family worries about that. They do. Do I think it's a possibility? I'm the guy that says\nwhat needs to be said. I've built my trust in this industry by not being scared of\ncalling out companies and individuals and not being scared of targeting criminals or criminal groups. - Your honesty as a\nhuman being emotionally and intellectually is really\nrefreshing, it's a gift. Thank you, thank you for doing that. Is there advice you can give to young people today about life? You broke many rules. All the rules. Some rules should be broken. So if you look at somebody\nyoung today in high school and college thinking how they\ncan break the rules legally and live a life that's\nsomething they could be really proud of, what would you say? - The biggest lesson I've learned? You want your life to be one\nwhere you're helping people and not hurting people. And that really hit me\nthe first time I walked into Quantico. You know, that's, you\nsee the brightest minds in the United States who\ngive up a lot of money, the opportunities, a lot of money because they believe in helping people. Where I spent a career just\nhurting and harming individuals. That's a hell of a lesson.\nAnd I'm glad I'm there. But I would tell people out\nthere, you know, it's fine to want money, it's fine to do that. It's fine to test systems, it's fine to circumvent the rules if\nyou're not breaking the law. It's fine to do all that. I\nlike doing that, all right? But if you've got the mindset,\nif you can just adhere to the mindset of helping\npeople and not hurting people, I think you'll be all right\nat the end of the day. - What gives you, again,\n(chuckles) given the dark web, given all the dangers out there, what gives you hope about the future? Looking into 5, 10 years,\n50 years, I mean, hope for human civilization. If we do all right, if we\nmake it out of this century, what do you think would be the reason? - [Brett] What would be, well,\nthat's a damn good question, because I mean, we got a\nlot of bad stuff going on. - We've got a lot of reasons.\n- A lot of reasons. - If asked you the other question of how do you think human\ncivilization will destroy itself? I'm sure you have a lot\nof answers. (laughs) - Oh yeah. You know what, what gives me hope is you see people working together. COVID has have been a little bit different because I think that\ntoo many people wanted to play politics with it. - That's been the heartbreaking\nthing about COVID, is it's in many ways pull people apart. I mean, because a virus involves kind of being afraid of each other because, I mean, that was a scary thing. People talk about pandemics in that way, that you're afraid of other humans. That is the most terrifying thing. It's not the destructive\nnature of what it does to your body, it's just\nthat it pulls people apart. And then you realize how fundamental that human connection is to humans. - Absolutely. Absolutely. But you know, as human beings,\nwhen things really get bad, when things really get\nbad, we do tend to respond and group together, we do that. - There's injustice.\n- Yeah. - We see it, we rise up. - I wake up in the morning\nand I watch Fox News and CNN, so I can be\npissed off at everyone. (both laughing) All right? - Division, the outrage,\nthey're really feeding. They want you to be angry. - Yeah, that's what causes me to spare and what I think that,\nyou know, we just need to. Elizabeth was very good. She taught me one hell\nof a lesson, because before I met her, I was a news hound. News was beyond all the time,\na couple channels of it, and she was the woman who\ndidn't watch the news at all. And I didn't understand\nthat back then, man. But now I do, you know, now\nI'm like, it's pretty smart. You know, (laughs) don't need to listen to that bullshit as it is. - That's why I love reading history books. I feel like that's the\nright perspective on take on modern times, you know? How will this time be written about in the history books?\n- Yeah. - And react to that. The daily ups and downs of the outages, which is getting worse and\nworse in terms of how quick the turnaround is in terms of the news. - I'll tell you what, I'm sitting here. I appreciate you talking to me. I do. Because, you know, I'm talking about that relationship and everything. It's really been this kind of realization for me on a lot of things. So I really appreciate\nyou asking those questions and everything. Me being able to talk about that. - I love it that you value, first of all, you're self-aware\nhow important love is in a human being's life. (laughs) It can make you do some of the best and some of the worst\nthings in this world. And it's good to think about that. It's good to think about that. That is what makes us\nhuman, is that connection and that love for each other. What do you think is the meaning of life? This big ridiculous question. Why the hell, what are we all here for? - I don't think it is ridiculous, man. To me, that meaning in life is finding out that lesson that we\nneed to help each other. You ask about security. I didn't get to say that, but, you know, everybody's\nworried about themselves. The way you solve that security problem is it takes everybody looking\nout for everyone else. That's how you solve that problem. - And whatever journey you\ntake to discovering that point. - Yeah, I mean, with, with me,\nI've been asked a few times, do you regret anything? Would you change anything? Now I've done a shit load\n(laughs) of despicable things in my life, but I'm at a\npoint in my life where I like who I am and I know\nthat I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to be doing in my life. So would I change anything? As bad as a lot of that\nshit has been, I wouldn't. - [Lex] It made you who you are. - Yeah. - [Lex] The whole of it, the whole mess. - I mean, that's trite to\nsay that, but it's true. That's the weird thing.\nIt's true. (laughs) - Yeah yeah. Yeah. Also, you mentioned that you're thinking of launching a show. What's it gonna be called? 'Cause you've done a couple of podcasts. You're incredibly good at\nthis. You're so good at this. - I've done a couple,\nI'm on a lot of podcasts and everything like that. I had the Fraudcast with a\nfriend of mine, Karisse Hendrick. And that ended because of a\ndifference of opinion. (laughs) Depending on who you ask. One of us was an asshole.\n- Yes. - And it may have been me.\n- Yeah. - But then I did, \"The\nAnglerPhish Podcast\", which that was, I gotta be honest with you, Lex, it was completely directionless and it was Brett Johnson getting lazy.\n- Yeah. - So I ended that. \"The Brett Johnson Show\" is launching-\n- That's the new one. That's what the new one's called? What do you thinking of doing with it? - Making a difference for one thing, but it's gonna be talking\nabout cyber crime security, helping people.\n- Interviews. - Interviews, solo interviews. A lot of it's gonna be solo. Now I'm calling it \"The\nBrett Johnson Show.\" I mean, I, because it's\ngonna handle crime, talk to criminals and how they turn their lives around to a degree as well. But there's some I wanna bitch about too. - Yeah. I can tell you're good at this. (Brett laughs) I'm a fan already. I'm gonna listen. I'm gonna subscribe. You should too. You'll launching it soon. - Soon. Next week. - Brett, you're an incredible human being. The honesty, the love, I\ncould just see how much of yourself you put out there. One of the best public\nspeakers I've ever heard. Definitely, you should be in a Scorsese film about cyber crime. (both laughing) 100%. I could tell You're a good actor. (Brett laughs) It makes perfect sense. Anyway, I really, I'm deeply honored that you spent your time with me today.\n- I am too. Thank you. - It was amazing. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Brett Johnson. To support this podcast,\nplease check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from George RR Martin. from \"A Clash of Kings.\" \"A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act, the good. Each should have its own reward. Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
