      "section": "Dark matter",
      "text": "One of the things you work on and write about is dark matter. We can't see it, but there's\na lot of it in the universe. You also end one of your books\nwith a Beatles song, quote, \"Got to be good-looking\n'cause he's so hard to see.\" (both laughs) What is dark matter? How should we think about it\ngiven that we can't see it? How should we visualize\nit in our mind's eye? - I think one of the\nreally important things that physics teaches you\nis just our limitations but also our abilities. So the fact that we can deduce\nthe existence of something that we don't directly\nsee is really a tribute to people, that we can do that. But it's also something that tells you, you can't overly rely\non your direct senses. If you just relied on just\nwhat you see directly, you would miss so much of\nwhat's happening in the world. And we can generalize this, but we're, just for now, to focus on dark matter. It's something we know is there, and it's not just one\nway we know it's there. In my book, \"Dark Matter\nand the Dinosaurs,\" I talk about the many different ways. There's eight or nine that we\ndeduce not just the existence of dark matter but how much is there. And they all agree. Now, how do we know it's there? Because of its gravitational force. And individually, a particle doesn't have such a big\ngravitational force. In fact, gravity is an\nextremely weak force compared to other forces\nwe know about in nature. But there's a lot of\ndark matter out there. It carries a lot of energy,\nfive times the amount of energy as the matter we know\nthat's in atoms, et cetera. So you can ask, how\nshould we think about it? Well, it's just another form of matter that doesn't interact with light, or at least as far as we know. So it interacts gravitationally. It clumps. It forms galaxies. But it doesn't interact with light, which means we just don't see it. And most of our detection, before gravitational wave\ndetectors, we only saw things because of their interactions\nwith light in some sense. - So in theory it, it behaves\njust like any other matter. It just doesn't interact with light. - So when we say it interacts\njust like any other form of matter, we have to be careful, because gravitationally, it interacts like other forms of matter, but it doesn't experience\nelectromagnetism, which is why it has a\ndifferent distribution. So in our galaxy, it's roughly spherical, unless it has its own interactions. That's another story. But we know that it's roughly spherical. Whereas ordinary matter can\nradiate and clumps into a disk. And that's why we see the Milky Way disk. So on large scales, in some sense, yes, all the matter is\nsimilar in some sense. In fact, dark matter is, in some sense, more important because it can collapse more readily than ordinary matter, because ordinary matter\nhas radiative forces, which makes it hard to\ncollapse on small scales. So actually, it's dark matter that sort of drives galaxy formation, and then ordinary matter\nkind of comes along with it. And there's also just more of it. And because there's more of it, it can start collapsing sooner. That is to say the energy\ndensity in dark matter dominates over radiation\nearlier than you would if you just had an ordinary matter. - So it's part of the story\nof the origin of a galaxy, part of the story of\nthe end of the galaxy, and part of the story of - Yeah.\n- all the various interactions throughout.\n- Exactly, I mean, in my book, I make kind\nof sort of jokes about, it's like when we think about a building, we think about the architect. We think about the high level, but we forget about all the workers that did all the grunt work. And in fact, dark matter\nwas really important in the formation of our universe. And we forget that sometimes. - That's a metaphor on top of a metaphor. Okay. (Lisa laughs) The unheard voices that\ndo the actual work. Okay.\n- Exactly, no, but it is a metaphor, but\nit also captures something, because the fact is we\ndon't directly see it. So we forget it's there, or we\ndon't understand it's there, or we think it's not. The fact that we don't see it\nmakes it no less legitimate. It just means that we have challenges in order to find out exactly what it is. - Yeah, but the things we cannot see that nevertheless have\ngravitational interaction with the things we can't\nsee is, at the layman level, it's just mind-blowing, you know? - It is, and it isn't, because I think what it's\nteaching us is that we're human. The universe is what it is. And we're trying to\ninteract with that universe and discover what it is. We've discovered amazing things. In fact, I would say it's more surprising that the matter that we\nknow about is constitutes as big a fraction of\nthe universe as it does. I mean, we're limited. We're human. And the fact that we see\n5% of the energy density of the universe, about 1/6 of\nthe energy density in matter, that's kinda remarkable. I mean, why should that be? There could be anything,\nanything could be out there, yet the universe that we see\nis a significant fraction. - Yeah, but a lot of\nour intuition, I think, operates using visualizations in the mind. - That's absolutely true. And it's certainly writing books that I realized also how many of our words are based on how we see the world. And that's true, and that's actually one of the fantastic things about physics, is that it teaches you how to go beyond your immediate\nintuition to develop intuitions that apply at different\ndistances, different scales, different ways of thinking about things. - Yeah, how do you\nanthropomorphize dark matter? - I just did, I think. I made it the grunt workers. - Oh yeah, that's good. Yeah, you did.\n(Lisa laughs) That's why you get paid the big bucks and write the great books. Okay, so you also write in that book about dark matter having to do something with the extinction events, the\nextinction of the dinosaurs, which is kind of a\nfascinating presentation of how everything is connected. So I guess the disturbances\nfrom the dark matter, they create gravitational\ndisturbances in the Oort cloud at the edge of our solar\nsystem, and then that increases the rate of asteroids hitting Earth. - So I wanna be really clear, this was a speculative theory. - [Lex] Mm-hm. I love it though. - I mean, and I liked it too. And we still don't know for sure, but we can, what we liked about it. So let me take a step back. So we usually assume that dark matter, we, being physicists,\nthat's just one thing. It's just basically\nnon-interacting, aside from gravity, or very weakly interacting matter. But again, we have to\nget outside this mindset of just humans and ask,\nwhat else could be there? And so what we suggested\nis that there's a fraction of dark matter, not all the dark matter, but some of the dark matter. Maybe it has interactions of its own. Just the same way in our universe, we have lots of different types of matter. We have nuclei. We have electrons. We have forces. We have lots. It's not a simple model,\nthe standard model, but it does have some basic ingredients. So maybe dark matter also has some interesting structure to it. So maybe there's some small fraction. And the interesting thing is\nthat if some of the dark matter does radiate, and I like\nto call it dark light because it's light that we don't see but dark matter would see,\nit could radiate that, and then it could perhaps\ncollapse into a disk the same way ordinary matter collapsed into the Milky Way disk. So it's not all the dark\nmatter, it's a fraction. But it could conceivably be a\nvery thin disk of dark matter, thin, dense disk of dark matter. And so then the question\nis, do these exist? And people have done studies now to think about whether they can find them. I mean, it's an interesting target. It's something you can measure. By measuring the positions\nand velocities of stars, you can find out what the\nstructure of the Milky Way is. But the fun proposal was\nthat the solar system orbits around the galaxy. And as it does so, it goes\na little bit up and down, kind of like horses on a carousel. And the suggestion was,\nevery time it goes through, you have an enhanced probability\nthat you would dislodge something from the edge\nof the solar system, in something called the Oort cloud. So the idea was that at those\ntimes, you're more likely to have these cataclysmic\nevents, such as the amazing one that actually caused the last extinction that we know of for sure. - It wasn't so amazing for the dinosaurs. - Or for two-thirds of\nthe species on the planet. - Yeah, but as it gets amazing for humans, we wouldn't be here. - What really is amazing. I mean, I do, I mean, I talk about this in \"Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs.\" It's just an amazing scientific story because it really is\none of the real stories that combine together\ndifferent fields of science. Geologists at the time, people thought that things happen slowly, and this would be a cataclysmic event. And also, I have to say, if you think about it,\nit sounds like a story like a five-year-old would make up. Maybe the dinosaurs were\nkilled by some big rock that came and hit the earth.\n- Yeah. - But then there really was\na scientific story behind it. And that's also why I like the dark disk, 'cause there's a\nscientific story behind it. So as far-fetched as it might\nsound, you could actually go and look for the\nexperimental consequences, for the observational consequences, to test whether it's true. - I wish you could know\nlike high-resolution details of where that asteroid came from, like where in the Oort\ncloud, why it happened. Is it in fact because of dark matter? Just like the full\ntracing back to the origin of the universe. Humans seem to be somewhat special, but it seems like so many\nfascinating events at all scales, at all scales of physics\nhad to happen for. - So I'm really, really\nglad you mentioned that because actually, that\nwas one of the main points of my book, \"Dark Matter\nand the Dinosaurs.\" One of the reasons I wrote it was because I really think\nwe are abusing the planet. We're changing the planet way too quickly. And just like anything\nelse, when you alter things, it's good to think about the history of what it took to get here. And as you point out,\nit took many operations on many different scales. We had to have the formation of structure, the formation of galaxies, the formation of the solar system, the formation of our planet, humans. I mean, there's so many\nsteps that go into this. And humans, in some part, were the result of the\nfact that this big object hit the earth, made the\ndinosaurs go extinct, and mammals developed. I mean, it is an incredible story and, yes, something else might come of it, but it won't be us if we\nmess with it too much. - But it is, on a grand scale, Earth is a pretty resilient system. Can you just clarify,\nit's just fascinating, the shape of things? So the shape of the Milky Way, of the observable stuff, is mostly flat. And you said dark matter\ntends to be spherical, but a subset of that might be a flat disk. - So you want to hear\nabout the shape of things. - [Lex] Yes. (laughs) Yes, please. - So structure formed early on, and now our structure that we live in is, so we know about the Milky Way galaxy. So the Milky Way galaxy has the disk you can see in a dry, dark place. That's where stars and light is. But you can also measure, in some ways, that dark matter. And we believe that dark matter is more or less spherically distributed. And like we said, there's a lot of it, not necessarily in the disk,\nbut just because it's a sphere, there's a lot of it sitting there. And the reason it doesn't\ncollapse, as far as we know, is that it doesn't really, it\ncan't radiate the same way. So because it can radiate,\nordinary matter collapses, and it's actually, because of\nconservation angular momentum, it stays a disk, and it doesn't\njust collapse to the center. So our suggestion was that\nmaybe there are some components of dark matter that also radiate. Like I said, that's far from proven. People have looked for a\ndisk, they see some evidence of some disks, of certain densities. But\n- I see. - these are all questions\nthat are worth asking. Basically, if we can figure it out from existing measurements, why not try? - Okay, so not all dark\nmatter's made the same. - Well, that's a possibility. We actually don't know\nwhat dark matter is. In the first place, we don't\nknow what most of it is. We don't know what a fraction is. I mean, it's hard to measure. Why is it hard to measure? For exactly the reason you\nsaid earlier, we don't see it. So we wanna think of\npossibilities for what it can be, especially if those give rise to some observational consequences. I mean, it's a tough game\nbecause it's not something that's just there for the taking. You have to think about what it could be and how you might find it. - And the way you detect\nit is gravitational effects on things we can see. - That would be the\nway you detect the type of dark matter I've been talking about. People have suggestions for\nother forms of dark matter. They could be particles called axions. They could be other types of particles. And then there are different\nways of detecting it. I mean, the most popular\ncandidate for dark matter, probably until pretty recently because they haven't found\nit, is something called WIMPs, weakly interacting massive particles, particles that have mass about the same as the Higgs boson mass. And turns out then, you would get about the right density of dark matter. But then people really\nlike that, of course, because it is connected\nto the standard model, the particles that we know about. And if it's connected to that, we have a better chance\nof actually seeing it. Fortunately or unfortunately,\nit's also a better chance that you can rule it out\nbecause you can look for it. And so far, no one has found it. We're still looking for it. - Is that one of the hopes\nof the Large Hadron Collider? - That was originally one of the hopes of Large Hadron Collider. I'd say at this point,\nit would be very unlikely given what they've already accomplished. But there are these underground detectors, XENON detectors, that look\nfor dark matter coming in. And they are going to try to achieve a much stronger bound than exists today. - Just take that tangent,\nlooking back now, what's the biggest, to you, insight to humanity that the LHC\nhas been able to provide? - It's interesting. It's both a major victory. The Higgs boson was proposed 50 years ago, and it was discovered. The Higgs mechanism\nseemed to be the only way to explain elementary particle\nmasses, and it was right. So on the one hand, it\nwas a major victory. On the other hand, I've\nbeen in physics long enough to know it was also a\ncautionary tale in some sense because at the time, I\nstarted out in physics, we had some proposed\nsomething in the United States called the Superconducting Super Collider. A lot of physicists, I'll\nsay particularly in Europe, but I'd say a lot of physicists, were saying when that\nthe Large Hadron Collider would have the energy reach necessary to discover what underlies\nthe standard model. We don't wanna just\ndiscover the standard model. We wanna know what the next step is. And I think here, people were\nmore cautious about that. They want to have a more\ncomprehensive search that could get to higher\nenergies, more events, so that we could really, more\ndefinitively rule it out. But in that case, many people thought they\nknew what would be there. It happened to be a theory\ncalled supersymmetry. So a lot of physicists thought\nit would be supersymmetry. I mean, it's one of the many\nfactors I think that went into the fact that the\nLarge Hadron Collider became the only machine in town. And the Superconducting Super Collider would've just been a much,\nif it had really had achieved what it was supposed to, would've been a much more\nrobust test of the space. So I'd say, for humanity, it's both a tribute to\nthe ability of discovery and the ability of really\nbelieving in things so that you have the\nconfidence to go look for them. But it's also a cautionary tale that you don't wanna assume things before they've been actually found. So you wanna do things, you wanna believe in your theories, but you also wanna question\nthem at the same time in ways that you're more\nlikely to discover the truth. - But it's also an illustration\nof grand engineering efforts that humanity can take\non and maybe a lesson that you could go even bigger. (chuckles) - I'm really glad you\nsaid that though, too, because that's absolutely true. I mean, it really is an impressive. It's impressive in so many ways. It's impressive technologically. It's impressive at engineering level. It's also impressive that so\nmany countries work together to do this. It wasn't just one country,\nand it was also impressive in that it was a long-term project that people committed\nto and made it happen. So it is a demonstration that when people set their minds to things\nand they commit to it, that they can do something amazing. - But also in the United\nStates, maybe a lesson that bureaucracy can slow things down to what everything.\n- Bureaucracy and politics. - Politics\n- And economics. Many, many things can make them\nfaster and make them slower. - So science is the way to make progress. Politics is the way to\nslow that progress down. And here we go.\n- Well, I don't wanna overstate that\nbecause without politics, - Yeah,\n- the LHC - I wouldn't either.\n- wouldn't happen either. So.\n- Yeah. - [Lisa] But. - You need broccoli. (both chuckles) - But sometimes I do think, I mean, you're not asking this question, but sometimes I do think when I think about some of these conflicts, sometimes it's just good to have a project that people work on together. And there were some efforts\nto do that in science too, to have Palestinians and\nIsraelis work together, project called SESAME. I think it's not a bad\nidea when you can do that. When you can get, sort of forget the politics and just focus on some particular project. Sometimes that can work. - Some kind of forcing\nfunction, some kinda deadline that gets people to\nsit in a room together, and you're working on a thing. But as part of that, you\nrealize the common humanity, that you all have the same\nconcerns, the same hopes, the same fears, the same, that you are all human. And that's a accidental side effect of working together on a thing. - That's absolutely true. And it's one of the reasons\nCERN was formed, actually. It was post-World War II, and a lot of European physicists\nhad actually left Europe. And they wanted to see\nEuropeans work together and sort of rebuild. And it worked. I mean, they did. And it's true. I often think that, that\none of the major problems is we just don't meet enough\npeople so that everyone thinks, when they seem like the other, it's more easy to forget their humanity. So I think it is important\nto have these connections."

      "section": "Extinction events",
      "text": "- Given the complexity,\nall cosmological scales involved here that led to the\nextinction of the dinosaurs, when you look out at the future of Earth, do you worry about\nfuture extinction events? - I do think that we\nmight be in the middle of an extinction right now if\nyou define it by the number of species that are getting killed off. And it's subtle, but\nit's a complex system. The way things respond to events is sometimes things evolve. Sometimes animals just\nmove to another place. And the way we've developed the Earth, it's very hard for species\njust to move somewhere else. And we're seeing that with people now too. I mean, I know people are worried\njust about AI taking over, and that's a totally different story. We just don't think about\nthe future very much. We think about what we're doing now. And we certainly don't think\nenough about all the animals that we're destroying, all\nthe things that are precursors to humans that we sort of rely on. - It's interesting to think whether the things that\nthreaten us is the stuff we see that's happening gradually or\nthe stuff we don't really see that's gonna happen all of a sudden. And sometimes, like think about what should we\nbe more worried about. Because it seems like with\nthe asteroids or nuclear war, it could be stuff that just\nhappens one day, you know? When I say one day, meaning over a span of a few days or a few months but not on a scale of\ndecades and centuries. 'Cause we sometimes\nmostly talk about stuff that's happening gradually,\nbut we can be really surprised. - It's actually really interesting. And that was actually one of\nthe reasons it took a while to determine what it was that\nit caused the last extinction because people did think, at the time, many people thought that\nthings were more gradual. And the idea of extinction\nwas actually a novel concept at some point. - Mm-hm. - I mean, these aren't\npredictable events necessarily. They're only predictable on a grand scale. But sometimes they are. And I think people were pretty aware that nuclear weapons were dangerous. I'm not sure people are\nas aware now as they were, say, 20 or 30 years ago, and that certainly worries me. I have to say I was not as\nworried about AI as other people, but now I understand. And it's not, I mean\nit's more that as soon as you create things that we\nlose control over, it's scary. And the other thing that we're learning from the events today is that\nit takes a few bad actors. It takes everyone to sort\nof make things work well. It takes not that many things\nto make things go wrong. It's the issue with disease. We can find out what causes a disease, but to make things better is\nnot necessarily that simple. Sometimes it is. But for things to be healthy,\na lot of things have to work. For things to go wrong, only\none thing has to go wrong. And so it's amazing that we do it. And the same is true for democracy. For democracy to work, a lot of people have to believe in it. A few bad actors can\ndestroy things sometimes. So a lot of the things\nthat we really rely on are delicate equilibrium situations. And there is some\nrobustness in the systems. We try to build in robustness. But a few extreme events\ncan sometimes alter things. And I think that's what people are scared of today in many ways. They're scared of it for democracy. They're scared of it for peace. They're scared of it for AI. I think they're not as\nscared as they should be about nuclear weapons, to be honest. I think that's a more serious\ndanger than people realize. I think people are a\nlittle bit more scared about pandemics than they were before. But I still say they're\nnot super scared about it. So you're right, there\nare these major events that can happen, and we\nare setting things up so that they might happen. And we should be thinking about them. The question is, who should\nbe thinking about them? How should we be thinking about them? How do you make things\nhappen on a global scale? 'Cause that's really what we need. - It certainly shouldn't\nbe a source of division. It should be a source of\ngrand collaboration, probably. - [Lisa] Wouldn't that be nice? - Yeah. I just wonder what it'd\nbe like to be a dinosaur. It must have been beautiful\nto like look at that asteroid just enter the atmosphere, until like everything just, man, that would be one of the things I would travel back in time to. It's just to watch it.\n- That's also one of the things that I think\nyou probably could do with virtual reality. I don't think you have to\nbe there and get extinct. - [Lex] So you just experienced it? - I think there's something. It's an event. You're just watching. You're not doing anything. You're just looking at it. So maybe you could just recreate it. - I actually heard that there's a nuclear\nweapon explosion experience in virtual reality\nthat's good to remind you about like what it would feel like. - I have to say, so I got an award from the Museum of Nuclear History and Technology in the Southwest. And I went to visit the\nmuseum, which turned out to be mostly a museum of nuclear weapons. And the scary thing is\nthat they look really cool, you know?\n- Yeah. - It's true that you have that, yes, this is scary, but you also have this, this is cool feeling. And I think we have to get around that because, yeah, I kind of think that, yes, you can be in that, but I'm not sure that's\ngoing to make people scared. Have they actually asked afterwards? Are you more or less scared? - Yeah, that's a good, it's a really good point. I mean that's a good summary\nof just humanity in general. We're attracted to creating cool stuff, even though it's can be dangerous. - And actually that was the\nreally interesting thing about visiting that museum actually. It was very nice 'cause\nI had a tour from people who had been working there on the Cold War and actually one or two people\nfrom the Manhattan Project. It was a very cool tour. And you just realize just\nhow just the thing itself gets you so excited. I think that's something that\nsometimes these movies miss, just the thing itself. You're not thinking about\nthe overall consequences. And it was kind of like, in some ways, it was like the early Silicon Valley. People were just thinking\nlike, what if we did this? What if we did that? And not keeping track of like what the peripheral consequences are. And you definitely see\nthat happening with AI now. I mean, I think that was\nthe moral of the battle that just happened, that\nit's just full speed ahead. - Which gives me a really great transition to another quote in your book. So you write about it, the\nexperience of facing the sublime in physics, and you quote Rainer Rilke. Quote, \"For beauty is nothing\nbut the beginning of terror, which we are still just able to endure, and we're so odd because\nit's serenely disdains to annihilate us.\" It's pretty intense. It, I think, applies to nuclear weapons. - But it also, I mean, at a more mundane, perhaps, level, I think it applies. It's really interesting. One of the things I found\nwhen I wrote these books is some people love certainty. Scientists kind of, many,\nrevel in uncertainty. It's not that you wanna be uncertain. You wanna solve it. But you're at this edge\nwhere it's really frustrating because you don't really\nwanna not know the answer. But of course, if you knew the answer, that would be, it would be done. So you're always at this edge where you're trying to sort things out, and there is something scary. You don't know what is. You don't know if there's\ngonna be a solution. You don't know if you're going to find it. So it's not something that\ncan destroy the earth. It's just something that you\ndo on your individual level. But then of course, there\nare much bigger things like the ones you're talking about where they could actually be dangerous. The stuff I do, I just wanna be clear, I'm doing theoretical\nphysics, not very dangerous, but sometimes things end up\nhaving bigger consequences than you think. - Yeah, but dangerous in\na very pragmatic sense. But isn't it still, in part, terrifying when you think\nof just the size of things, like the size of dark matter, like the power of this thing in terms of, is potential gravitational effects. Just this cosmological\nobjects of a black hole at the center of our galaxy. - So this might be why I'm a\nphysicist or why I'm different from other people.\n- Yeah. - Because I'm not such a big\nfan of humanity in some ways. Some ways I am, but the\nidea that we were everything would be really boring to me. I love the idea that there's\nso much more out there, that there's a bigger universe, and there's lots to discover, and that we're not all there is. Wouldn't it be disappointing\nif we were all there is? - Yeah, and the full\ndiversity of other stuff. It's pretty interesting. - We have no idea how much there is. We know what we can observe so far. So the idea that there's\nother stuff out there that we yet have to\nfigure out, it's exciting. - Well, let me ask you out-there question. Okay, so if you think\nof like humans on earth, life on earth, as this pocket\nof complexity that emerged, and there's a bunch of\nconditions that came to be, and there's Darwinian evolution\nand however life originated, do you think it's possible\nthere's some pockets of complexity of that\nsort inside dark matter that we can't see?\n- Well, so that's possible. - Chemistry and biology\nevolving in different ways. - And that's one of\nthe reasons we suggest. I mean, it's not the reason, but it would be true\nif there were the type of interactions we'd suggest. I mean, it would need more complex ones. And we don't know. I will say that the\nconditions that give rise to life and complexity, they're complex. They're unlikely. So it's not like there's\ngreat odds that would happen. But there's no reason to\nknow that it doesn't happen. It's worth investigating. Are there other forces that exist in the dark matter sector? That's exactly. - So the dark matter sector\ndoesn't have all the forces of the standard model of physics? - Right, as far as we know, it doesn't have any. It might have it at some low level. - Yeah.\n- But it could have its own forces just like, - Yeah.\n- the dark matter might not experience our light. Maybe it has its light\nthat we don't experience. - So there could be other kinds of forces. - I mean there could be\nother kinds of forces even within our sector\nthat are too weak for us to have discovered so far or that exist at different scales than we know about. I mean we detect what\ninteracts strongly enough with our detectors to detect. So it's worth asking. And that's one of the reasons\nwe build big colliders, to see are there other\nforces, other particles that exist, say, at higher energies, at shorter distance scales\nthan we've explored so far. So it's not just in\nthe dark matter sector. Even in our sector, there\ncould be a whole bunch of stuff we don't yet know."

      "text": "- So maybe let's zoom out and look at the standard\nmodel of particle physics. How does dark matter fit into it? First of all, what is it? Can you explain what\nthe standard model is? - So the standard model\nof particle physics is, basically, it tells us about\nnature's most basic elements and their interactions. And so it's the substructure\nas far as we understand it. So if you look at atoms, we know they have nuclei and electrons. Nuclei have protons and neutrons in them. Protons and neutrons have\nparticles called quarks that are held together by\nsomething called the strong force. They interact through the strong force, the strong nuclear force. There's something called\nthe weak nuclear force and electromagnetism. So basically, all those\nparticles and their interactions describe many, many things we understand. That's the standard model. We now know about the Higgs\nboson, which is associated with how elementary\nparticles get their mass. So that piece of the puzzle\nhas also been completed. We also know that there are\nkind of a weird array of masses of elementary particles. There's not just the up and down quark, but there are heavier versions\nof the up and down quark, charm and strange, top and bottom. There's not just the electron. There's a muon and a tau. There are particles called neutrinos, which are under intense study\nnow, which are partnered with the leptons through\nthe weak interactions. So we really do know these basic elements, and we know the forces, we know. I mean, when we're doing\nparticle physics experiments, we can usually even ignore gravity, except in exceptional cases\nthat we can talk about. So those are the basic\nelements in their interactions. Dark matters stands outside that. It's not interacting through those forces. So when we look at the world around us, we don't usually see the\neffects of dark matter. It's because there's so\nmuch of it that we do, and it doesn't have those\nforces that we know about. But the standard model has\nworked spectacularly well. It's been tested to a\nhigh degree of precision. People are still testing it. And one of the things we do as physicists is we actually want it to\nbreak down at some level. We're looking for the precision\nmeasurement or the energy, or whatever it will take,\nwhere the standard model is no longer working. Like, not that it's not\nworking approximately, but we're looking for the deviations. And those deviations are critical because they can tell us what\nunderlies the standard model, which is what we really wanna see next. - Where can you find the places where the standard model breaks down? Like where are the places you can see those tiny little deviations? - So we don't know yet, but we know the kinds of things\nyou wouldn't wanna look for. So one obvious place to\nlook is at higher energy. We're looking at the\nLarge Hadron Collider, but we'd love to go beyond that. Higher energy means shorter distances, and it means things that we\njust couldn't produce before. I mean, E equals mc-squared. So if you have a heavy particle and you don't have\nenough energy to make it, you'll never see it. So that's one place. The other place is precision measurements. The standard model has\nbeen tested exquisitely. So if it's been tested 1%, you wanna look at a 10th of a percent. And there are some processes that we know shouldn't even happen at\nall in the standard model or happen at very suppressed level. And those are other\nthings that we look for. So all of those things could indicate there's something beyond\nwhat we know about, which of course would be very exciting. - When you just step back and\nlook at the standard model, the quarks and all the different\nparticles and neutrinos, isn't it wild how this like\nlittle system came to be and creates, is underpins\neverything we see? - Absolutely, and that's why we'd like to understand it better. We wanna know, is it part\nof some bigger sector? Why are these particles, why did they have the masses they do? - [Lex] Yeah. - Why is the Higgs boson so light compared to the mass it could have had? Which we might've even expected\nbased on the principles of special relativity\nand quantum mechanics. So that's a really big question. Why are they what they are? - And they originate. There's like some mechanism\nthat created the whole thing. - That's one of the things\nwe're trying to study. Why is it what it is? - I mean, even just like the\nmechanism that creates stuff, like the way a human being is\ncreated from a single cell. It's like (imitates wind blowing) embryogenesis, like\nthere's the whole thing, like you build up this thing. All of it, this whole thing, comes to be from just like a- - Well, don't forget it is\ninteracting with the environment. - Sure. Okay, right. Right, right. It's not incidentally right. - [Lisa] It's important. Well, that's a really good question, is how much of it is the environment? Is it just the environment\nacting on a set of constraints? And like, how much of it\nis just the information in the DNA or any information? How much is it in the initial\nconditions of the universe versus some other thing acting on it? - These are big questions. These are big questions in\npretty much every field. For the universe, we do consider it, it's everything there is by definition. But people now think about it,\nis it one of many universes? And of course, it's a misnomer, but could there be other places where there are self-contained\ngravitational systems that we don't even interact with? So, but those are really\nimportant questions. And the only way we're gonna answer them is we go back as far as we can. We try to think theoretically, and we try to think about\nobservational consequences. That's all we can do. - One interesting way to\nexplore the standard model is to look at your fun\nnuanced disagreement with Carlo Rovelli. (Lisa laughs) When you talked about\nhim writing in his book, \"Electrons don't always exist. They exist when they interact. They materialize in a\nplace when they collide with something else.\" And you wrote that, well, I'll just read the whole thing 'cause it's kinda interesting. \"Stocks may not achieve a precise value until they are traded,\nbut that doesn't mean we can't approximate their\nworth until they change hands. Similarly, electrons might\nnot have definite properties, but they do exist. It's true that the electron doesn't exist as a classical object\nwith definite position until the position is measured. But something was there, which physicists use a\nwave function to describe.\" It's a fascinating nuanced disagreement. So do electrons always exist or not? Does a tree fall in the forest\nif nobody's there to see it? - So I like to think of the universe as being out there, whether or not. I mean, it would be really\nweird if the only time things came into existence was when I\nsaw them, or I measured them. - [Lex] There's a lot of weird stuff. - I mean, I could believe that\nthe Middle East doesn't exist because I'm not there now. - Yeah.\n- I mean, that would be kind of ridiculous. I think we would all agree on that. So I think there's only so\nmuch that we can attribute to our own powers of seeing. And the whole system\ndoesn't come into being because I'm measuring it. And so what is weird, and\nthis isn't even a disagreement about the standard model. This is a disagreement\nabout how you interpret quantum mechanics. I mean, I would say that\nthose wave functions are real. I mean one of the things that, don't forget that particle physics does, that quantum field theory\nsays, is that electrons can be created and destroyed. It's not that every electron\nhas to be in the universe. I mean there can be. I mean that's what happens at colliders. Particles get created and destroyed. But that doesn't mean that if\nI have electron in an atom, it's not there. It's certainly there,\nand we know about it. It's charge is there. - So physics is the kinda\nway to see the world. So at the bottom, what's\nthe bottom turtle? Do you have a sense that\nthere's a bottom reality that we're trying to\napproximate with physics? - I think we always have in our head maybe that we'd like to find\nthat, but I have to, I mean, I might not seem so, but I think I'm kinda more\nhumble than a lot of physicists. I'm not sure that we're ever\ngonna get to that bottom level. But I do think we're\ngoing to keep penetrating different layers and get further. - I just wonder how far\naway we are, you know? - We all wonder that. Like, what's even the measure\nof how far away we are? I mean one way you can measure it is just by our everyday lives. In terms of our everyday lives,\nwe've measured everything. In terms of what underlies\nit, there's a lot more to see. And so part of it has to do\nwith how far we think we can go. I mean it might be that the\nnature of reality changes so much that even these\nterms are different. Maybe we'll measure. The notion of distance itself might break down at some point. - But also to push back on\nthe, we've measured everything, maybe there's stuff we\nhaven't even considered is measurable. For example, consciousness, or there might be stuff,\njust like you said, forces unseen, undetected. - So it's an interesting thing. And this is often a\nconfusion that happens. So there's sort of the\nfundamental stuff underlying it, and then there's sort of the higher levels what we'll call like an\neffective theory at some level. - [Lex] Mm-hm. - So we're not always working. I mean, when I throw a ball, I don't tell you where every atom is. I tell you there's a ball. And so there might be\ndifferent layers of reality that are built on terms of\nthe matter that we know about, in terms of the stuff we know about. And when I say we've measured everything, I say that with a grain of salt. - Right, of course.\n- I mean I measure everything. - That's true.\n- I understand them all. So there's lots of phenomena\nthat we don't understand, but often there are complex\nphenomena that will be given in terms of the fundamental\ningredients that we know about. - But that is an interesting\nquestion because, yes, there's phenomena that\nare at the higher level of abstractions that emerge, but maybe, like with consciousness,\nthere is far out people that think that consciousness\nis panpsychus, right? That there's going to be\nalmost like a fundamental force of physics, that's\ncautiousness, that permeates all that, right?\n- So usually, when you have a crazy, sorry, okay, when you have a far-out theory, - Yes.\n- the thing you do is you test all the possibilities within the constructs that exist. - Yeah.\n- So you don't just jump to the most far out possibility. I mean you can do that, but\nthen to see if it's true, you either have to find evidence of it, or you have to show that it's\nnot possible without that. And we're very far from that. - I think one of the\ncriticisms of your theory on the dinosaurs was that it requires, if I remember correctly for dark matter, to be weirder than it already is. And then I think you had\na clever response to that. Can you remind? - I'm not sure I remember\nwhat I said then, but I mean, we have no idea how weird dark matter is. I mean it's based on everyone thinking they know what dark matter is. I mean so weirder than it already is. I mean it's not already anything. We don't know what it is. So there's no normalization here. - So dark matter, do we know that if dark matter varies in density? - It just certainly does in the universe. Just like, I mean, so for example, there's\nmore dark matter in galaxies than there's between galaxies.\n- Sure. - [Lisa] So it clumps. I mean, so it's matter. So it's distributed like matter. It is matter. - It does clump. But the full details of how it clumps and the complexity of the clumping. - It's understood pretty well. People do simulations. I mean, where people are\nalways looking for things, including us as particle physics, is sort of at small scales, are the deviations on small scales, so that indicating other\ninteractions or other processes or interactions with baryons. That is to say normal matter\nthat we don't understand. But on large scales, we have\na pretty good understanding of dark matter distribution. - You were part of a\nrecent debate on, quote, \"Can science uncover reality?\" Let me ask you this question then. What do you think is\nthe limits of science? - I'm smart enough to know I have no idea. And also, it's not even clear what science means, right? Because there's the science that we do, which is particle physics. We try to find fundamental things and figure out what their effects are. There's science like biology where, at a higher level, the\nkind of questions you ask are different, the kind of\nmeasurements are different. The kind of science that's going to happen in the sort of more numerical age, I mean, or even AI, like what does\nit mean to answer a question? Does it mean that we can predict it? Does it mean that we can reproduce it? So I think, we're coming up\nagainst sort of the definition of what we mean by\nscience as human beings. So in terms of the science that we can do, I don't think we'll know\nit until we get there. We're trying to solve hard problems, and we've made progress. I mean if you think of how\nmuch science has advanced in the last century or century\nand a half, it's incredible. I mean, we didn't even know\nthe universe was expanding at the beginning of the 20th century. We didn't know about quantum mechanics at the beginning of the century. We didn't know about special relativity. That's a lot in a relatively short time depending on how you think of time. So I think it would be premature\nto say we know limitations. - And at various points\nthroughout the history, we thought we solved\neverything or declared, or at least various people declared.\n- Where we was various people. Exactly.\n- Yeah, yeah. Declared that we've solved everything. So this also a good place to, maybe, could you describe the\ndifference between top-down and bottom-up approaches\nto theoretical physics that you talked about in the book? - So you could try to jump\nin and say I have a theory that I think is so perfect, that I can predict everything from it or at least predict some\nsalient features from it. - Mm-hm, that's top-down. - That would be a top-down. Bottom-up is more like the\nquestions we just asked, like why are masses what they are? We measure things. We wanna put them together. - Mm-hm.\n- And usually, a good approach is to combine the two if you ask a very specific question. But combine it with the methods of knowing that there could be a\nfundamental theory underlying it, sometimes you make progress. I mean, the community tends\nto get segmented or fragmented into people who do one or the other. But there are definitely times, I mean, some of my best collaborations\nhave been with people who are more top-down than\nI am so that we come up with interesting ideas that\nwe wouldn't have thought of if either one of us was\nworking individually. - Would you say the truly\nbig leaps happened top-down, like Einstein? - Einstein was not a top-down\nperson in the beginning. Special relativity was very\nmuch him thinking about. They were thought experiments,\nbut he was very much, the original theory about relativity is something like on the\nnature of electromagnetism. He was trying to understand\nhow Maxwell's laws could make sense when they seemed to have different symmetries than what we had thought they were. So he was very much a bottom-up person. And in fact, he resisted\ntop-down for a long time. Then when he tried to do the\ntheory of general relativity or the general theory of relativity, whichever you wanna call\nit, incorporating gravity into the system when\nyou need some feedback, then he was helped by a\nmathematician who had developed some differential geometry\nand helped him figure out how to write down that. And after that, he thought\ntop-down was the way to go, but he actually didn't\nmake that much progress. - [Lex] Mm-hm. - So I think it's naive to think it was just one or the other. In fact, a lot of people\nwho made real progress were rooted in actual measurements."

      "section": "Physics vs mathematics",
      "text": "- Well, speaking of mathematicians, what to you is the difference, because you've had a bit of foot in both between physics and mathematics, in the way it helps us\nunderstand the world? - Well, to be frank, there's a lot more overlap\nin physics and math. I think that, I mean, well maybe not more, but\nthere's certainly a lot. But I think, again, the kinds of questions you're\nasking are usually different. Mathematicians like the structure itself. - Mm-hm.\n- Physicists are trying to concentrate on, to some extent, on the consequences for the world. But there is a lot of overlap. - The string theory is an example. There's certain theories where, there's a certain kind of\nmathematical beauty to it. - There's also some really\ncool ideas that you get in particle physics where you\ncan describe what's going on and connect it to other ideas. That's also really beautiful. - [Lex] Mm-hm. - I think, basically,\ninsights can be beautiful. They might seem simple, and\nsometimes they genuinely are, and sometimes they're\nbuilt on a whole system that you have to understand before. I mean if you actually saw\nEinstein's equations written out in components, if you wouldn't\nthink it's so beautiful, you write in a compact way. It looks nice. - What do you think about the successes and the failures of string theory? To what degree do you think it succeeded, to what degrees it not\nsucceeded yet or has failed? - I think, to talk about any science in terms of success and\nfailure often misses the point because there's not some absolute thing. And I think, I do think\nthat string theorists were a bit overly ambitious. Not overly ambitious but a\nlittle bit overly arrogant in the beginning, thinking\nthey could solve many problems that they weren't going to solve. That's not to say the methods and advances in string theory don't exist, but they certainly weren't\nable to immediately solve all the problems they\nthought they could solve. But it has given us tools. It has given us some insights, but it becomes almost a\nsociological question of, like, how much it should\nbe, one or the other? I do think that you can get caught up in the problems themselves, and sometimes you can get\ncaught up in the methods and just sort of do other examples. So the real physics insights\noften come from people who are thinking about\nphysics as well as math. - 'Cause you mentioned AI, is their hope that AI might be able to help find some interesting insights? I mean, another question, another way to ask this question\nis, how special are humans that we're able to discover\nnovel insights about the world? - That's a great question, and it depends on what kind of insights, and we're going to find that out. I mean, because it's hard\nto think about something that doesn't quite exist yet, I mean, I could just\nthink about something. Take a step back. It's a little bit like\ntrying to stand three, four dimensions. You go back to three dimensions to go to something you can imagine. So you can sort of say a lot of the things in a very different\nlevel about the internet. You could say, has the\ninternet helped do things? It definitely took on a life\nof its own in some sense, but it's also something\nthat we're able to tame. I know that I, myself,\nwouldn't have been able to write books if the\ninternet didn't exist because I wouldn't have had the time to go to the library and look everything up. And it helped me enormously. And in some sense, AI could\nbe that in a very nice world. It could be a tool that helps us go a step\nfurther than we would and a lot more efficiently. And it's already done that to some extent. Or it could be like the\nparts of the internet that we can't control,\nruining politics or whatever. And there's certainly a lot of\nindications that can do that. Then there are even bigger things that people speculate about, about AI being able to do its own things. But in terms of actually\nfiguring things out, we're in the early stages. - Yeah, there's several directions here. One is like on the theorem\nprover side, so WolframAlpha, where everything's much more precise, and we have large language\nmodel type of stuff. One of the limitations of\nthose is it seems to come up with convincing-looking things, which we don't know if it's true or not. - [Lisa] Right. - And that's a big problem for physics. - So large language models are more or less like generalizations\nof stuff that we have. So the question is, so\nthere's still breakthroughs in AI waiting to happen, and\nmaybe they are happening. And maybe they'll be good, maybe not, but that's not quite the same. I mean, maybe in some cases, it's just pattern recognition that leads to important things. But sometimes it could be\nsomething more insightful than that, that I can't\neven put my finger on. So it forces us to, I mean, we don't really\nunderstand how smart we are. We don't understand how\nwe think about things all that well actually. But one thing is true, that\nwe are a lot more efficient right now than computers,\nand coming up with things, we require a lot less energy to do that. So if computers figure out how to do that, then it's gonna be a\ntotally different ball game. And so there are clearly\nkinds of connections that we don't know how we're\nmaking, but we are making them. And so that's going to be interesting. So, I say we're in early stages, but this is changing very rapidly. But right now, I don't\nthink that it's actually, we discovered like new laws of physics, but could it in the future? Maybe it can. - It will raise big questions about, what is special about humans\nthat we don't quite appreciate? There could be things that are like, that leap of insight that\nhappens, truly novel ideas that could potentially\nbe very difficult to do. - So there are sort of\nabstract questions like that. There's also questions of\nhow is it that we can address to some extent, how will\nAI be used in the context of the world we live\nin, which is based on, at least our countries based on capitalism in a certain political system. And how will global politics deal with it? How will our capitalist\nsystem deal with it? What will be the things that\nwe focus on doing with it? How much will researchers\nget control of it to be able to ask different\nsorts of questions? I mean, while it was starting out, people were doing these\nkind of toy problems, but what will it actually be applied to, and what will it be optimized to do? There's a lot of questions out there that it's really important\nwe start addressing. - What to you is the most\nbeautiful unsolved problem in physics and cosmology? What to you is really\nexciting if we can unlock the mystery of in the next few decades? - So is it, what's the most\nbeautiful unsolved problem, or what is the most\nbeautiful unsolved problem I think we can make progress on? (Lex laughs) - Oh, boy. We make progress on in\nthe next few centuries. (Lisa chuckles) - Most of the questions, the big questions have to do with what underlies things, how things started,\nwhat's at the base of it. There's also just basic\nquestions that you asked earlier, how far will science take us? How much can we understand? There are questions like how we got here, what underlies it? But also, I mean there's\nreally deep questions like what fraction are we actually seeing, if there are these other forces, if there is another way\nof seeing the world? Are there universes beyond our own there? If they're so totally different, how do we even comprehend them? I mean, how do we detect, like what would we even think about them? So there's a lot about\ntrying to get beyond, it's always just getting\nbeyond our limited vision and limited experience and\ntrying to see what underlies it, both at small scales and at large scales. We just don't know the answers. I mean, I'd like to think\nthat we understand more about dark matter, about dark energy, about are there extra dimensions, things that we actually work on. But there's probably a\nlot beyond what we work on that's yet to be discovered. - Yeah, understanding the\nextra dimensions piece will be really interesting. - Totally. I mean, if it is how the universe went from higher dimensions to what we see, are the extra dimensions\npresent everywhere? I mean, one of the\nreally interesting pieces of physics we did that I\ntalk about in my first book, \"Warped Passages,\" is finding out that there can be a higher\ndimension, but only locally do you think there's a\ngravity of a lower dimension. So it could be like\nonly locally do we think we live in three dimensions. It could be higher\ndimensions is different. That's not actually the gravity we have, but there's all sorts of\nphenomena that might be out there that we don't know about. All sorts of evolution things, time dependence that we don't know about. And of course, that's\nfrom the point of view of particle physics,\nfrom the point of view of other kinds of physics. We're just beginning, so who knows? - Yeah, if the physics changes throughout, is not homogeneous\nthroughout the universe, that'll be weird. - I mean, for the observable universe, it's the same, but beyond\nthe observable universe, who knows? - What advice would you give? You've had an exceptional career. What advice would you\ngive to young people, maybe high school, college, on how to have a career\nthey can be proud of and a life they can be proud of? - I think the weird thing\nabout being a scientist or an academic in general is you have to believe\nreally strongly what you do while questioning it all the time. And that's a hard balance to have. Sometimes it helps to\ncollaborate with people. But to really believe that\nyou could have good ideas at the same time knowing\nthey could all be wrong, that's a tough tightrope\nto walk sometimes. But to really test them out. The other thing is sometimes,\nif you get too far buried, you look out and you think, oh, there's so much out there. And sometimes it's just\ngood to bring it back home and just think, okay,\ncan I have as good idea as the person next to me rather\nthan the greatest physicist who ever lived? But right now, like you said, I think there's lots of\nbig issues out there, and it's hard to balance that. And sometimes it's hard to\nforget the role of physics. But I think, Wilson said it\nreally well when he said, when they were building Fermilab, it was like, this won't\ndefend the country, but it'll make it worth defending. There's just the idea\nthat, in all this chaos, it's still important that\nwe still make progress in these things. And sometimes, when major\nworld events are happening, it's easy to forget that. And I think those are important too. You don't wanna forget those\nbut to try to keep that balance because we don't wanna lose what it is that makes humans special. - So that's the big picture. Do you also lose yourself in the simple joy of puzzle solving? - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we all like solving puzzles. And actually, one of the\nthings that drives me in my research is the inconsistencies. When things don't make\nsense, it really bugs me. And I just will go into\ndifferent directions to see how could these\nthings fit together. - So it bugs you, but that motivates you. - [Lisa] Yeah, totally. - Until it doesn't. - Because I think,\n- Just to resolve it. - I have this underlying belief\nthat it should make sense, - Yeah.\n- even though the world comes at you in many ways and tells you nothing should make sense. But if you believe that it makes sense, then you look for underlying logic. And I think that's just\ngood advice for everything, to try to find like why\nit is the way it is. I talk about effective\ntheory in my second book, \"Knocking on Heaven's Door,\" a lot. Rather than ask the big\nquestions, sometimes we just ask the questions about the immediate things that we can measure. Like I said, we can sometimes\ntell one that we'll fail, but we can have these effective theories. And sometimes I think, when we\napproach these big questions, it's good to do it from\nan effective theory point. Why do I find this satisfying? Why is the world we have the way it is? We think things are\nbeautiful that we live in. I mean, I'm not sure, if we had different senses or different ways of looking at things, we wouldn't necessarily find it beautiful. But I have to say, it is kind of fantastic that no matter how many\ntimes I see a sunset, I will always find it beautiful. It's like, I don't think I ever\nsee a sunset as a whatever. It's just always beautiful. And so there are things, as humans, clearly resonate with us, but we were maybe evolved that way. But that's about us. But in terms of figuring out the universe, it's kind of amazing how far we've gotten. We have discovered many,\nmany wonderful things, but there's a lot more out there. And I hope we have the\nopportunity to keep going. - And with effective theories,\none small step at a time. Just keep unraveling the mystery. - But also having in\nmind the big questions, but doing one small\nstep at a time, exactly. - Yeah, looking out to the stars. You said, the sunset. For me, it's the sunset, the sunrise, and just looking at the stars. It's wondering what's all out there and having a lot of hope that\nhumans will figure it out. - Right. I like it. - Lisa, well, thank you\nfor being one of the humans - Well, thank you - in a world\n- for having me here. - that are pushing it forward and figuring out this\nbeautiful puzzle of ours. And thank you for talking today. This is amazing. - Thank you. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Lisa Randall. To support this podcast,\nplease check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein. \"The important thing is\nto not stop questioning. Curiosity has its own\nreason for existence.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."

  "full_text": "- The following is a\nconversation with Lisa Randall, a theoretical physicist\nand cosmologist at Harvard. Her work involves\nimproving our understanding of particle physics,\nsupersymmetry, baryogenesis, cosmological inflation, and dark matter. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Lisa Randall. One of the things you work on and write about is dark matter. We can't see it, but there's\na lot of it in the universe. You also end one of your books\nwith a Beatles song, quote, \"Got to be good-looking\n'cause he's so hard to see.\" (both laughs) What is dark matter? How should we think about it\ngiven that we can't see it? How should we visualize\nit in our mind's eye? - I think one of the\nreally important things that physics teaches you\nis just our limitations but also our abilities. So the fact that we can deduce\nthe existence of something that we don't directly\nsee is really a tribute to people, that we can do that. But it's also something that tells you, you can't overly rely\non your direct senses. If you just relied on just\nwhat you see directly, you would miss so much of\nwhat's happening in the world. And we can generalize this, but we're, just for now, to focus on dark matter. It's something we know is there, and it's not just one\nway we know it's there. In my book, \"Dark Matter\nand the Dinosaurs,\" I talk about the many different ways. There's eight or nine that we\ndeduce not just the existence of dark matter but how much is there. And they all agree. Now, how do we know it's there? Because of its gravitational force. And individually, a particle doesn't have such a big\ngravitational force. In fact, gravity is an\nextremely weak force compared to other forces\nwe know about in nature. But there's a lot of\ndark matter out there. It carries a lot of energy,\nfive times the amount of energy as the matter we know\nthat's in atoms, et cetera. So you can ask, how\nshould we think about it? Well, it's just another form of matter that doesn't interact with light, or at least as far as we know. So it interacts gravitationally. It clumps. It forms galaxies. But it doesn't interact with light, which means we just don't see it. And most of our detection, before gravitational wave\ndetectors, we only saw things because of their interactions\nwith light in some sense. - So in theory it, it behaves\njust like any other matter. It just doesn't interact with light. - So when we say it interacts\njust like any other form of matter, we have to be careful, because gravitationally, it interacts like other forms of matter, but it doesn't experience\nelectromagnetism, which is why it has a\ndifferent distribution. So in our galaxy, it's roughly spherical, unless it has its own interactions. That's another story. But we know that it's roughly spherical. Whereas ordinary matter can\nradiate and clumps into a disk. And that's why we see the Milky Way disk. So on large scales, in some sense, yes, all the matter is\nsimilar in some sense. In fact, dark matter is, in some sense, more important because it can collapse more readily than ordinary matter, because ordinary matter\nhas radiative forces, which makes it hard to\ncollapse on small scales. So actually, it's dark matter that sort of drives galaxy formation, and then ordinary matter\nkind of comes along with it. And there's also just more of it. And because there's more of it, it can start collapsing sooner. That is to say the energy\ndensity in dark matter dominates over radiation\nearlier than you would if you just had an ordinary matter. - So it's part of the story\nof the origin of a galaxy, part of the story of\nthe end of the galaxy, and part of the story of - Yeah.\n- all the various interactions throughout.\n- Exactly, I mean, in my book, I make kind\nof sort of jokes about, it's like when we think about a building, we think about the architect. We think about the high level, but we forget about all the workers that did all the grunt work. And in fact, dark matter\nwas really important in the formation of our universe. And we forget that sometimes. - That's a metaphor on top of a metaphor. Okay. (Lisa laughs) The unheard voices that\ndo the actual work. Okay.\n- Exactly, no, but it is a metaphor, but\nit also captures something, because the fact is we\ndon't directly see it. So we forget it's there, or we\ndon't understand it's there, or we think it's not. The fact that we don't see it\nmakes it no less legitimate. It just means that we have challenges in order to find out exactly what it is. - Yeah, but the things we cannot see that nevertheless have\ngravitational interaction with the things we can't\nsee is, at the layman level, it's just mind-blowing, you know? - It is, and it isn't, because I think what it's\nteaching us is that we're human. The universe is what it is. And we're trying to\ninteract with that universe and discover what it is. We've discovered amazing things. In fact, I would say it's more surprising that the matter that we\nknow about is constitutes as big a fraction of\nthe universe as it does. I mean, we're limited. We're human. And the fact that we see\n5% of the energy density of the universe, about 1/6 of\nthe energy density in matter, that's kinda remarkable. I mean, why should that be? There could be anything,\nanything could be out there, yet the universe that we see\nis a significant fraction. - Yeah, but a lot of\nour intuition, I think, operates using visualizations in the mind. - That's absolutely true. And it's certainly writing books that I realized also how many of our words are based on how we see the world. And that's true, and that's actually one of the fantastic things about physics, is that it teaches you how to go beyond your immediate\nintuition to develop intuitions that apply at different\ndistances, different scales, different ways of thinking about things. - Yeah, how do you\nanthropomorphize dark matter? - I just did, I think. I made it the grunt workers. - Oh yeah, that's good. Yeah, you did.\n(Lisa laughs) That's why you get paid the big bucks and write the great books. Okay, so you also write in that book about dark matter having to do something with the extinction events, the\nextinction of the dinosaurs, which is kind of a\nfascinating presentation of how everything is connected. So I guess the disturbances\nfrom the dark matter, they create gravitational\ndisturbances in the Oort cloud at the edge of our solar\nsystem, and then that increases the rate of asteroids hitting Earth. - So I wanna be really clear, this was a speculative theory. - [Lex] Mm-hm. I love it though. - I mean, and I liked it too. And we still don't know for sure, but we can, what we liked about it. So let me take a step back. So we usually assume that dark matter, we, being physicists,\nthat's just one thing. It's just basically\nnon-interacting, aside from gravity, or very weakly interacting matter. But again, we have to\nget outside this mindset of just humans and ask,\nwhat else could be there? And so what we suggested\nis that there's a fraction of dark matter, not all the dark matter, but some of the dark matter. Maybe it has interactions of its own. Just the same way in our universe, we have lots of different types of matter. We have nuclei. We have electrons. We have forces. We have lots. It's not a simple model,\nthe standard model, but it does have some basic ingredients. So maybe dark matter also has some interesting structure to it. So maybe there's some small fraction. And the interesting thing is\nthat if some of the dark matter does radiate, and I like\nto call it dark light because it's light that we don't see but dark matter would see,\nit could radiate that, and then it could perhaps\ncollapse into a disk the same way ordinary matter collapsed into the Milky Way disk. So it's not all the dark\nmatter, it's a fraction. But it could conceivably be a\nvery thin disk of dark matter, thin, dense disk of dark matter. And so then the question\nis, do these exist? And people have done studies now to think about whether they can find them. I mean, it's an interesting target. It's something you can measure. By measuring the positions\nand velocities of stars, you can find out what the\nstructure of the Milky Way is. But the fun proposal was\nthat the solar system orbits around the galaxy. And as it does so, it goes\na little bit up and down, kind of like horses on a carousel. And the suggestion was,\nevery time it goes through, you have an enhanced probability\nthat you would dislodge something from the edge\nof the solar system, in something called the Oort cloud. So the idea was that at those\ntimes, you're more likely to have these cataclysmic\nevents, such as the amazing one that actually caused the last extinction that we know of for sure. - It wasn't so amazing for the dinosaurs. - Or for two-thirds of\nthe species on the planet. - Yeah, but as it gets amazing for humans, we wouldn't be here. - What really is amazing. I mean, I do, I mean, I talk about this in \"Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs.\" It's just an amazing scientific story because it really is\none of the real stories that combine together\ndifferent fields of science. Geologists at the time, people thought that things happen slowly, and this would be a cataclysmic event. And also, I have to say, if you think about it,\nit sounds like a story like a five-year-old would make up. Maybe the dinosaurs were\nkilled by some big rock that came and hit the earth.\n- Yeah. - But then there really was\na scientific story behind it. And that's also why I like the dark disk, 'cause there's a\nscientific story behind it. So as far-fetched as it might\nsound, you could actually go and look for the\nexperimental consequences, for the observational consequences, to test whether it's true. - I wish you could know\nlike high-resolution details of where that asteroid came from, like where in the Oort\ncloud, why it happened. Is it in fact because of dark matter? Just like the full\ntracing back to the origin of the universe. Humans seem to be somewhat special, but it seems like so many\nfascinating events at all scales, at all scales of physics\nhad to happen for. - So I'm really, really\nglad you mentioned that because actually, that\nwas one of the main points of my book, \"Dark Matter\nand the Dinosaurs.\" One of the reasons I wrote it was because I really think\nwe are abusing the planet. We're changing the planet way too quickly. And just like anything\nelse, when you alter things, it's good to think about the history of what it took to get here. And as you point out,\nit took many operations on many different scales. We had to have the formation of structure, the formation of galaxies, the formation of the solar system, the formation of our planet, humans. I mean, there's so many\nsteps that go into this. And humans, in some part, were the result of the\nfact that this big object hit the earth, made the\ndinosaurs go extinct, and mammals developed. I mean, it is an incredible story and, yes, something else might come of it, but it won't be us if we\nmess with it too much. - But it is, on a grand scale, Earth is a pretty resilient system. Can you just clarify,\nit's just fascinating, the shape of things? So the shape of the Milky Way, of the observable stuff, is mostly flat. And you said dark matter\ntends to be spherical, but a subset of that might be a flat disk. - So you want to hear\nabout the shape of things. - [Lex] Yes. (laughs) Yes, please. - So structure formed early on, and now our structure that we live in is, so we know about the Milky Way galaxy. So the Milky Way galaxy has the disk you can see in a dry, dark place. That's where stars and light is. But you can also measure, in some ways, that dark matter. And we believe that dark matter is more or less spherically distributed. And like we said, there's a lot of it, not necessarily in the disk,\nbut just because it's a sphere, there's a lot of it sitting there. And the reason it doesn't\ncollapse, as far as we know, is that it doesn't really, it\ncan't radiate the same way. So because it can radiate,\nordinary matter collapses, and it's actually, because of\nconservation angular momentum, it stays a disk, and it doesn't\njust collapse to the center. So our suggestion was that\nmaybe there are some components of dark matter that also radiate. Like I said, that's far from proven. People have looked for a\ndisk, they see some evidence of some disks, of certain densities. But\n- I see. - these are all questions\nthat are worth asking. Basically, if we can figure it out from existing measurements, why not try? - Okay, so not all dark\nmatter's made the same. - Well, that's a possibility. We actually don't know\nwhat dark matter is. In the first place, we don't\nknow what most of it is. We don't know what a fraction is. I mean, it's hard to measure. Why is it hard to measure? For exactly the reason you\nsaid earlier, we don't see it. So we wanna think of\npossibilities for what it can be, especially if those give rise to some observational consequences. I mean, it's a tough game\nbecause it's not something that's just there for the taking. You have to think about what it could be and how you might find it. - And the way you detect\nit is gravitational effects on things we can see. - That would be the\nway you detect the type of dark matter I've been talking about. People have suggestions for\nother forms of dark matter. They could be particles called axions. They could be other types of particles. And then there are different\nways of detecting it. I mean, the most popular\ncandidate for dark matter, probably until pretty recently because they haven't found\nit, is something called WIMPs, weakly interacting massive particles, particles that have mass about the same as the Higgs boson mass. And turns out then, you would get about the right density of dark matter. But then people really\nlike that, of course, because it is connected\nto the standard model, the particles that we know about. And if it's connected to that, we have a better chance\nof actually seeing it. Fortunately or unfortunately,\nit's also a better chance that you can rule it out\nbecause you can look for it. And so far, no one has found it. We're still looking for it. - Is that one of the hopes\nof the Large Hadron Collider? - That was originally one of the hopes of Large Hadron Collider. I'd say at this point,\nit would be very unlikely given what they've already accomplished. But there are these underground detectors, XENON detectors, that look\nfor dark matter coming in. And they are going to try to achieve a much stronger bound than exists today. - Just take that tangent,\nlooking back now, what's the biggest, to you, insight to humanity that the LHC\nhas been able to provide? - It's interesting. It's both a major victory. The Higgs boson was proposed 50 years ago, and it was discovered. The Higgs mechanism\nseemed to be the only way to explain elementary particle\nmasses, and it was right. So on the one hand, it\nwas a major victory. On the other hand, I've\nbeen in physics long enough to know it was also a\ncautionary tale in some sense because at the time, I\nstarted out in physics, we had some proposed\nsomething in the United States called the Superconducting Super Collider. A lot of physicists, I'll\nsay particularly in Europe, but I'd say a lot of physicists, were saying when that\nthe Large Hadron Collider would have the energy reach necessary to discover what underlies\nthe standard model. We don't wanna just\ndiscover the standard model. We wanna know what the next step is. And I think here, people were\nmore cautious about that. They want to have a more\ncomprehensive search that could get to higher\nenergies, more events, so that we could really, more\ndefinitively rule it out. But in that case, many people thought they\nknew what would be there. It happened to be a theory\ncalled supersymmetry. So a lot of physicists thought\nit would be supersymmetry. I mean, it's one of the many\nfactors I think that went into the fact that the\nLarge Hadron Collider became the only machine in town. And the Superconducting Super Collider would've just been a much,\nif it had really had achieved what it was supposed to, would've been a much more\nrobust test of the space. So I'd say, for humanity, it's both a tribute to\nthe ability of discovery and the ability of really\nbelieving in things so that you have the\nconfidence to go look for them. But it's also a cautionary tale that you don't wanna assume things before they've been actually found. So you wanna do things, you wanna believe in your theories, but you also wanna question\nthem at the same time in ways that you're more\nlikely to discover the truth. - But it's also an illustration\nof grand engineering efforts that humanity can take\non and maybe a lesson that you could go even bigger. (chuckles) - I'm really glad you\nsaid that though, too, because that's absolutely true. I mean, it really is an impressive. It's impressive in so many ways. It's impressive technologically. It's impressive at engineering level. It's also impressive that so\nmany countries work together to do this. It wasn't just one country,\nand it was also impressive in that it was a long-term project that people committed\nto and made it happen. So it is a demonstration that when people set their minds to things\nand they commit to it, that they can do something amazing. - But also in the United\nStates, maybe a lesson that bureaucracy can slow things down to what everything.\n- Bureaucracy and politics. - Politics\n- And economics. Many, many things can make them\nfaster and make them slower. - So science is the way to make progress. Politics is the way to\nslow that progress down. And here we go.\n- Well, I don't wanna overstate that\nbecause without politics, - Yeah,\n- the LHC - I wouldn't either.\n- wouldn't happen either. So.\n- Yeah. - [Lisa] But. - You need broccoli. (both chuckles) - But sometimes I do think, I mean, you're not asking this question, but sometimes I do think when I think about some of these conflicts, sometimes it's just good to have a project that people work on together. And there were some efforts\nto do that in science too, to have Palestinians and\nIsraelis work together, project called SESAME. I think it's not a bad\nidea when you can do that. When you can get, sort of forget the politics and just focus on some particular project. Sometimes that can work. - Some kind of forcing\nfunction, some kinda deadline that gets people to\nsit in a room together, and you're working on a thing. But as part of that, you\nrealize the common humanity, that you all have the same\nconcerns, the same hopes, the same fears, the same, that you are all human. And that's a accidental side effect of working together on a thing. - That's absolutely true. And it's one of the reasons\nCERN was formed, actually. It was post-World War II, and a lot of European physicists\nhad actually left Europe. And they wanted to see\nEuropeans work together and sort of rebuild. And it worked. I mean, they did. And it's true. I often think that, that\none of the major problems is we just don't meet enough\npeople so that everyone thinks, when they seem like the other, it's more easy to forget their humanity. So I think it is important\nto have these connections. - Given the complexity,\nall cosmological scales involved here that led to the\nextinction of the dinosaurs, when you look out at the future of Earth, do you worry about\nfuture extinction events? - I do think that we\nmight be in the middle of an extinction right now if\nyou define it by the number of species that are getting killed off. And it's subtle, but\nit's a complex system. The way things respond to events is sometimes things evolve. Sometimes animals just\nmove to another place. And the way we've developed the Earth, it's very hard for species\njust to move somewhere else. And we're seeing that with people now too. I mean, I know people are worried\njust about AI taking over, and that's a totally different story. We just don't think about\nthe future very much. We think about what we're doing now. And we certainly don't think\nenough about all the animals that we're destroying, all\nthe things that are precursors to humans that we sort of rely on. - It's interesting to think whether the things that\nthreaten us is the stuff we see that's happening gradually or\nthe stuff we don't really see that's gonna happen all of a sudden. And sometimes, like think about what should we\nbe more worried about. Because it seems like with\nthe asteroids or nuclear war, it could be stuff that just\nhappens one day, you know? When I say one day, meaning over a span of a few days or a few months but not on a scale of\ndecades and centuries. 'Cause we sometimes\nmostly talk about stuff that's happening gradually,\nbut we can be really surprised. - It's actually really interesting. And that was actually one of\nthe reasons it took a while to determine what it was that\nit caused the last extinction because people did think, at the time, many people thought that\nthings were more gradual. And the idea of extinction\nwas actually a novel concept at some point. - Mm-hm. - I mean, these aren't\npredictable events necessarily. They're only predictable on a grand scale. But sometimes they are. And I think people were pretty aware that nuclear weapons were dangerous. I'm not sure people are\nas aware now as they were, say, 20 or 30 years ago, and that certainly worries me. I have to say I was not as\nworried about AI as other people, but now I understand. And it's not, I mean\nit's more that as soon as you create things that we\nlose control over, it's scary. And the other thing that we're learning from the events today is that\nit takes a few bad actors. It takes everyone to sort\nof make things work well. It takes not that many things\nto make things go wrong. It's the issue with disease. We can find out what causes a disease, but to make things better is\nnot necessarily that simple. Sometimes it is. But for things to be healthy,\na lot of things have to work. For things to go wrong, only\none thing has to go wrong. And so it's amazing that we do it. And the same is true for democracy. For democracy to work, a lot of people have to believe in it. A few bad actors can\ndestroy things sometimes. So a lot of the things\nthat we really rely on are delicate equilibrium situations. And there is some\nrobustness in the systems. We try to build in robustness. But a few extreme events\ncan sometimes alter things. And I think that's what people are scared of today in many ways. They're scared of it for democracy. They're scared of it for peace. They're scared of it for AI. I think they're not as\nscared as they should be about nuclear weapons, to be honest. I think that's a more serious\ndanger than people realize. I think people are a\nlittle bit more scared about pandemics than they were before. But I still say they're\nnot super scared about it. So you're right, there\nare these major events that can happen, and we\nare setting things up so that they might happen. And we should be thinking about them. The question is, who should\nbe thinking about them? How should we be thinking about them? How do you make things\nhappen on a global scale? 'Cause that's really what we need. - It certainly shouldn't\nbe a source of division. It should be a source of\ngrand collaboration, probably. - [Lisa] Wouldn't that be nice? - Yeah. I just wonder what it'd\nbe like to be a dinosaur. It must have been beautiful\nto like look at that asteroid just enter the atmosphere, until like everything just, man, that would be one of the things I would travel back in time to. It's just to watch it.\n- That's also one of the things that I think\nyou probably could do with virtual reality. I don't think you have to\nbe there and get extinct. - [Lex] So you just experienced it? - I think there's something. It's an event. You're just watching. You're not doing anything. You're just looking at it. So maybe you could just recreate it. - I actually heard that there's a nuclear\nweapon explosion experience in virtual reality\nthat's good to remind you about like what it would feel like. - I have to say, so I got an award from the Museum of Nuclear History and Technology in the Southwest. And I went to visit the\nmuseum, which turned out to be mostly a museum of nuclear weapons. And the scary thing is\nthat they look really cool, you know?\n- Yeah. - It's true that you have that, yes, this is scary, but you also have this, this is cool feeling. And I think we have to get around that because, yeah, I kind of think that, yes, you can be in that, but I'm not sure that's\ngoing to make people scared. Have they actually asked afterwards? Are you more or less scared? - Yeah, that's a good, it's a really good point. I mean that's a good summary\nof just humanity in general. We're attracted to creating cool stuff, even though it's can be dangerous. - And actually that was the\nreally interesting thing about visiting that museum actually. It was very nice 'cause\nI had a tour from people who had been working there on the Cold War and actually one or two people\nfrom the Manhattan Project. It was a very cool tour. And you just realize just\nhow just the thing itself gets you so excited. I think that's something that\nsometimes these movies miss, just the thing itself. You're not thinking about\nthe overall consequences. And it was kind of like, in some ways, it was like the early Silicon Valley. People were just thinking\nlike, what if we did this? What if we did that? And not keeping track of like what the peripheral consequences are. And you definitely see\nthat happening with AI now. I mean, I think that was\nthe moral of the battle that just happened, that\nit's just full speed ahead. - Which gives me a really great transition to another quote in your book. So you write about it, the\nexperience of facing the sublime in physics, and you quote Rainer Rilke. Quote, \"For beauty is nothing\nbut the beginning of terror, which we are still just able to endure, and we're so odd because\nit's serenely disdains to annihilate us.\" It's pretty intense. It, I think, applies to nuclear weapons. - But it also, I mean, at a more mundane, perhaps, level, I think it applies. It's really interesting. One of the things I found\nwhen I wrote these books is some people love certainty. Scientists kind of, many,\nrevel in uncertainty. It's not that you wanna be uncertain. You wanna solve it. But you're at this edge\nwhere it's really frustrating because you don't really\nwanna not know the answer. But of course, if you knew the answer, that would be, it would be done. So you're always at this edge where you're trying to sort things out, and there is something scary. You don't know what is. You don't know if there's\ngonna be a solution. You don't know if you're going to find it. So it's not something that\ncan destroy the earth. It's just something that you\ndo on your individual level. But then of course, there\nare much bigger things like the ones you're talking about where they could actually be dangerous. The stuff I do, I just wanna be clear, I'm doing theoretical\nphysics, not very dangerous, but sometimes things end up\nhaving bigger consequences than you think. - Yeah, but dangerous in\na very pragmatic sense. But isn't it still, in part, terrifying when you think\nof just the size of things, like the size of dark matter, like the power of this thing in terms of, is potential gravitational effects. Just this cosmological\nobjects of a black hole at the center of our galaxy. - So this might be why I'm a\nphysicist or why I'm different from other people.\n- Yeah. - Because I'm not such a big\nfan of humanity in some ways. Some ways I am, but the\nidea that we were everything would be really boring to me. I love the idea that there's\nso much more out there, that there's a bigger universe, and there's lots to discover, and that we're not all there is. Wouldn't it be disappointing\nif we were all there is? - Yeah, and the full\ndiversity of other stuff. It's pretty interesting. - We have no idea how much there is. We know what we can observe so far. So the idea that there's\nother stuff out there that we yet have to\nfigure out, it's exciting. - Well, let me ask you out-there question. Okay, so if you think\nof like humans on earth, life on earth, as this pocket\nof complexity that emerged, and there's a bunch of\nconditions that came to be, and there's Darwinian evolution\nand however life originated, do you think it's possible\nthere's some pockets of complexity of that\nsort inside dark matter that we can't see?\n- Well, so that's possible. - Chemistry and biology\nevolving in different ways. - And that's one of\nthe reasons we suggest. I mean, it's not the reason, but it would be true\nif there were the type of interactions we'd suggest. I mean, it would need more complex ones. And we don't know. I will say that the\nconditions that give rise to life and complexity, they're complex. They're unlikely. So it's not like there's\ngreat odds that would happen. But there's no reason to\nknow that it doesn't happen. It's worth investigating. Are there other forces that exist in the dark matter sector? That's exactly. - So the dark matter sector\ndoesn't have all the forces of the standard model of physics? - Right, as far as we know, it doesn't have any. It might have it at some low level. - Yeah.\n- But it could have its own forces just like, - Yeah.\n- the dark matter might not experience our light. Maybe it has its light\nthat we don't experience. - So there could be other kinds of forces. - I mean there could be\nother kinds of forces even within our sector\nthat are too weak for us to have discovered so far or that exist at different scales than we know about. I mean we detect what\ninteracts strongly enough with our detectors to detect. So it's worth asking. And that's one of the reasons\nwe build big colliders, to see are there other\nforces, other particles that exist, say, at higher energies, at shorter distance scales\nthan we've explored so far. So it's not just in\nthe dark matter sector. Even in our sector, there\ncould be a whole bunch of stuff we don't yet know. - So maybe let's zoom out and look at the standard\nmodel of particle physics. How does dark matter fit into it? First of all, what is it? Can you explain what\nthe standard model is? - So the standard model\nof particle physics is, basically, it tells us about\nnature's most basic elements and their interactions. And so it's the substructure\nas far as we understand it. So if you look at atoms, we know they have nuclei and electrons. Nuclei have protons and neutrons in them. Protons and neutrons have\nparticles called quarks that are held together by\nsomething called the strong force. They interact through the strong force, the strong nuclear force. There's something called\nthe weak nuclear force and electromagnetism. So basically, all those\nparticles and their interactions describe many, many things we understand. That's the standard model. We now know about the Higgs\nboson, which is associated with how elementary\nparticles get their mass. So that piece of the puzzle\nhas also been completed. We also know that there are\nkind of a weird array of masses of elementary particles. There's not just the up and down quark, but there are heavier versions\nof the up and down quark, charm and strange, top and bottom. There's not just the electron. There's a muon and a tau. There are particles called neutrinos, which are under intense study\nnow, which are partnered with the leptons through\nthe weak interactions. So we really do know these basic elements, and we know the forces, we know. I mean, when we're doing\nparticle physics experiments, we can usually even ignore gravity, except in exceptional cases\nthat we can talk about. So those are the basic\nelements in their interactions. Dark matters stands outside that. It's not interacting through those forces. So when we look at the world around us, we don't usually see the\neffects of dark matter. It's because there's so\nmuch of it that we do, and it doesn't have those\nforces that we know about. But the standard model has\nworked spectacularly well. It's been tested to a\nhigh degree of precision. People are still testing it. And one of the things we do as physicists is we actually want it to\nbreak down at some level. We're looking for the precision\nmeasurement or the energy, or whatever it will take,\nwhere the standard model is no longer working. Like, not that it's not\nworking approximately, but we're looking for the deviations. And those deviations are critical because they can tell us what\nunderlies the standard model, which is what we really wanna see next. - Where can you find the places where the standard model breaks down? Like where are the places you can see those tiny little deviations? - So we don't know yet, but we know the kinds of things\nyou wouldn't wanna look for. So one obvious place to\nlook is at higher energy. We're looking at the\nLarge Hadron Collider, but we'd love to go beyond that. Higher energy means shorter distances, and it means things that we\njust couldn't produce before. I mean, E equals mc-squared. So if you have a heavy particle and you don't have\nenough energy to make it, you'll never see it. So that's one place. The other place is precision measurements. The standard model has\nbeen tested exquisitely. So if it's been tested 1%, you wanna look at a 10th of a percent. And there are some processes that we know shouldn't even happen at\nall in the standard model or happen at very suppressed level. And those are other\nthings that we look for. So all of those things could indicate there's something beyond\nwhat we know about, which of course would be very exciting. - When you just step back and\nlook at the standard model, the quarks and all the different\nparticles and neutrinos, isn't it wild how this like\nlittle system came to be and creates, is underpins\neverything we see? - Absolutely, and that's why we'd like to understand it better. We wanna know, is it part\nof some bigger sector? Why are these particles, why did they have the masses they do? - [Lex] Yeah. - Why is the Higgs boson so light compared to the mass it could have had? Which we might've even expected\nbased on the principles of special relativity\nand quantum mechanics. So that's a really big question. Why are they what they are? - And they originate. There's like some mechanism\nthat created the whole thing. - That's one of the things\nwe're trying to study. Why is it what it is? - I mean, even just like the\nmechanism that creates stuff, like the way a human being is\ncreated from a single cell. It's like (imitates wind blowing) embryogenesis, like\nthere's the whole thing, like you build up this thing. All of it, this whole thing, comes to be from just like a- - Well, don't forget it is\ninteracting with the environment. - Sure. Okay, right. Right, right. It's not incidentally right. - [Lisa] It's important. Well, that's a really good question, is how much of it is the environment? Is it just the environment\nacting on a set of constraints? And like, how much of it\nis just the information in the DNA or any information? How much is it in the initial\nconditions of the universe versus some other thing acting on it? - These are big questions. These are big questions in\npretty much every field. For the universe, we do consider it, it's everything there is by definition. But people now think about it,\nis it one of many universes? And of course, it's a misnomer, but could there be other places where there are self-contained\ngravitational systems that we don't even interact with? So, but those are really\nimportant questions. And the only way we're gonna answer them is we go back as far as we can. We try to think theoretically, and we try to think about\nobservational consequences. That's all we can do. - One interesting way to\nexplore the standard model is to look at your fun\nnuanced disagreement with Carlo Rovelli. (Lisa laughs) When you talked about\nhim writing in his book, \"Electrons don't always exist. They exist when they interact. They materialize in a\nplace when they collide with something else.\" And you wrote that, well, I'll just read the whole thing 'cause it's kinda interesting. \"Stocks may not achieve a precise value until they are traded,\nbut that doesn't mean we can't approximate their\nworth until they change hands. Similarly, electrons might\nnot have definite properties, but they do exist. It's true that the electron doesn't exist as a classical object\nwith definite position until the position is measured. But something was there, which physicists use a\nwave function to describe.\" It's a fascinating nuanced disagreement. So do electrons always exist or not? Does a tree fall in the forest\nif nobody's there to see it? - So I like to think of the universe as being out there, whether or not. I mean, it would be really\nweird if the only time things came into existence was when I\nsaw them, or I measured them. - [Lex] There's a lot of weird stuff. - I mean, I could believe that\nthe Middle East doesn't exist because I'm not there now. - Yeah.\n- I mean, that would be kind of ridiculous. I think we would all agree on that. So I think there's only so\nmuch that we can attribute to our own powers of seeing. And the whole system\ndoesn't come into being because I'm measuring it. And so what is weird, and\nthis isn't even a disagreement about the standard model. This is a disagreement\nabout how you interpret quantum mechanics. I mean, I would say that\nthose wave functions are real. I mean one of the things that, don't forget that particle physics does, that quantum field theory\nsays, is that electrons can be created and destroyed. It's not that every electron\nhas to be in the universe. I mean there can be. I mean that's what happens at colliders. Particles get created and destroyed. But that doesn't mean that if\nI have electron in an atom, it's not there. It's certainly there,\nand we know about it. It's charge is there. - So physics is the kinda\nway to see the world. So at the bottom, what's\nthe bottom turtle? Do you have a sense that\nthere's a bottom reality that we're trying to\napproximate with physics? - I think we always have in our head maybe that we'd like to find\nthat, but I have to, I mean, I might not seem so, but I think I'm kinda more\nhumble than a lot of physicists. I'm not sure that we're ever\ngonna get to that bottom level. But I do think we're\ngoing to keep penetrating different layers and get further. - I just wonder how far\naway we are, you know? - We all wonder that. Like, what's even the measure\nof how far away we are? I mean one way you can measure it is just by our everyday lives. In terms of our everyday lives,\nwe've measured everything. In terms of what underlies\nit, there's a lot more to see. And so part of it has to do\nwith how far we think we can go. I mean it might be that the\nnature of reality changes so much that even these\nterms are different. Maybe we'll measure. The notion of distance itself might break down at some point. - But also to push back on\nthe, we've measured everything, maybe there's stuff we\nhaven't even considered is measurable. For example, consciousness, or there might be stuff,\njust like you said, forces unseen, undetected. - So it's an interesting thing. And this is often a\nconfusion that happens. So there's sort of the\nfundamental stuff underlying it, and then there's sort of the higher levels what we'll call like an\neffective theory at some level. - [Lex] Mm-hm. - So we're not always working. I mean, when I throw a ball, I don't tell you where every atom is. I tell you there's a ball. And so there might be\ndifferent layers of reality that are built on terms of\nthe matter that we know about, in terms of the stuff we know about. And when I say we've measured everything, I say that with a grain of salt. - Right, of course.\n- I mean I measure everything. - That's true.\n- I understand them all. So there's lots of phenomena\nthat we don't understand, but often there are complex\nphenomena that will be given in terms of the fundamental\ningredients that we know about. - But that is an interesting\nquestion because, yes, there's phenomena that\nare at the higher level of abstractions that emerge, but maybe, like with consciousness,\nthere is far out people that think that consciousness\nis panpsychus, right? That there's going to be\nalmost like a fundamental force of physics, that's\ncautiousness, that permeates all that, right?\n- So usually, when you have a crazy, sorry, okay, when you have a far-out theory, - Yes.\n- the thing you do is you test all the possibilities within the constructs that exist. - Yeah.\n- So you don't just jump to the most far out possibility. I mean you can do that, but\nthen to see if it's true, you either have to find evidence of it, or you have to show that it's\nnot possible without that. And we're very far from that. - I think one of the\ncriticisms of your theory on the dinosaurs was that it requires, if I remember correctly for dark matter, to be weirder than it already is. And then I think you had\na clever response to that. Can you remind? - I'm not sure I remember\nwhat I said then, but I mean, we have no idea how weird dark matter is. I mean it's based on everyone thinking they know what dark matter is. I mean so weirder than it already is. I mean it's not already anything. We don't know what it is. So there's no normalization here. - So dark matter, do we know that if dark matter varies in density? - It just certainly does in the universe. Just like, I mean, so for example, there's\nmore dark matter in galaxies than there's between galaxies.\n- Sure. - [Lisa] So it clumps. I mean, so it's matter. So it's distributed like matter. It is matter. - It does clump. But the full details of how it clumps and the complexity of the clumping. - It's understood pretty well. People do simulations. I mean, where people are\nalways looking for things, including us as particle physics, is sort of at small scales, are the deviations on small scales, so that indicating other\ninteractions or other processes or interactions with baryons. That is to say normal matter\nthat we don't understand. But on large scales, we have\na pretty good understanding of dark matter distribution. - You were part of a\nrecent debate on, quote, \"Can science uncover reality?\" Let me ask you this question then. What do you think is\nthe limits of science? - I'm smart enough to know I have no idea. And also, it's not even clear what science means, right? Because there's the science that we do, which is particle physics. We try to find fundamental things and figure out what their effects are. There's science like biology where, at a higher level, the\nkind of questions you ask are different, the kind of\nmeasurements are different. The kind of science that's going to happen in the sort of more numerical age, I mean, or even AI, like what does\nit mean to answer a question? Does it mean that we can predict it? Does it mean that we can reproduce it? So I think, we're coming up\nagainst sort of the definition of what we mean by\nscience as human beings. So in terms of the science that we can do, I don't think we'll know\nit until we get there. We're trying to solve hard problems, and we've made progress. I mean if you think of how\nmuch science has advanced in the last century or century\nand a half, it's incredible. I mean, we didn't even know\nthe universe was expanding at the beginning of the 20th century. We didn't know about quantum mechanics at the beginning of the century. We didn't know about special relativity. That's a lot in a relatively short time depending on how you think of time. So I think it would be premature\nto say we know limitations. - And at various points\nthroughout the history, we thought we solved\neverything or declared, or at least various people declared.\n- Where we was various people. Exactly.\n- Yeah, yeah. Declared that we've solved everything. So this also a good place to, maybe, could you describe the\ndifference between top-down and bottom-up approaches\nto theoretical physics that you talked about in the book? - So you could try to jump\nin and say I have a theory that I think is so perfect, that I can predict everything from it or at least predict some\nsalient features from it. - Mm-hm, that's top-down. - That would be a top-down. Bottom-up is more like the\nquestions we just asked, like why are masses what they are? We measure things. We wanna put them together. - Mm-hm.\n- And usually, a good approach is to combine the two if you ask a very specific question. But combine it with the methods of knowing that there could be a\nfundamental theory underlying it, sometimes you make progress. I mean, the community tends\nto get segmented or fragmented into people who do one or the other. But there are definitely times, I mean, some of my best collaborations\nhave been with people who are more top-down than\nI am so that we come up with interesting ideas that\nwe wouldn't have thought of if either one of us was\nworking individually. - Would you say the truly\nbig leaps happened top-down, like Einstein? - Einstein was not a top-down\nperson in the beginning. Special relativity was very\nmuch him thinking about. They were thought experiments,\nbut he was very much, the original theory about relativity is something like on the\nnature of electromagnetism. He was trying to understand\nhow Maxwell's laws could make sense when they seemed to have different symmetries than what we had thought they were. So he was very much a bottom-up person. And in fact, he resisted\ntop-down for a long time. Then when he tried to do the\ntheory of general relativity or the general theory of relativity, whichever you wanna call\nit, incorporating gravity into the system when\nyou need some feedback, then he was helped by a\nmathematician who had developed some differential geometry\nand helped him figure out how to write down that. And after that, he thought\ntop-down was the way to go, but he actually didn't\nmake that much progress. - [Lex] Mm-hm. - So I think it's naive to think it was just one or the other. In fact, a lot of people\nwho made real progress were rooted in actual measurements. - Well, speaking of mathematicians, what to you is the difference, because you've had a bit of foot in both between physics and mathematics, in the way it helps us\nunderstand the world? - Well, to be frank, there's a lot more overlap\nin physics and math. I think that, I mean, well maybe not more, but\nthere's certainly a lot. But I think, again, the kinds of questions you're\nasking are usually different. Mathematicians like the structure itself. - Mm-hm.\n- Physicists are trying to concentrate on, to some extent, on the consequences for the world. But there is a lot of overlap. - The string theory is an example. There's certain theories where, there's a certain kind of\nmathematical beauty to it. - There's also some really\ncool ideas that you get in particle physics where you\ncan describe what's going on and connect it to other ideas. That's also really beautiful. - [Lex] Mm-hm. - I think, basically,\ninsights can be beautiful. They might seem simple, and\nsometimes they genuinely are, and sometimes they're\nbuilt on a whole system that you have to understand before. I mean if you actually saw\nEinstein's equations written out in components, if you wouldn't\nthink it's so beautiful, you write in a compact way. It looks nice. - What do you think about the successes and the failures of string theory? To what degree do you think it succeeded, to what degrees it not\nsucceeded yet or has failed? - I think, to talk about any science in terms of success and\nfailure often misses the point because there's not some absolute thing. And I think, I do think\nthat string theorists were a bit overly ambitious. Not overly ambitious but a\nlittle bit overly arrogant in the beginning, thinking\nthey could solve many problems that they weren't going to solve. That's not to say the methods and advances in string theory don't exist, but they certainly weren't\nable to immediately solve all the problems they\nthought they could solve. But it has given us tools. It has given us some insights, but it becomes almost a\nsociological question of, like, how much it should\nbe, one or the other? I do think that you can get caught up in the problems themselves, and sometimes you can get\ncaught up in the methods and just sort of do other examples. So the real physics insights\noften come from people who are thinking about\nphysics as well as math. - 'Cause you mentioned AI, is their hope that AI might be able to help find some interesting insights? I mean, another question, another way to ask this question\nis, how special are humans that we're able to discover\nnovel insights about the world? - That's a great question, and it depends on what kind of insights, and we're going to find that out. I mean, because it's hard\nto think about something that doesn't quite exist yet, I mean, I could just\nthink about something. Take a step back. It's a little bit like\ntrying to stand three, four dimensions. You go back to three dimensions to go to something you can imagine. So you can sort of say a lot of the things in a very different\nlevel about the internet. You could say, has the\ninternet helped do things? It definitely took on a life\nof its own in some sense, but it's also something\nthat we're able to tame. I know that I, myself,\nwouldn't have been able to write books if the\ninternet didn't exist because I wouldn't have had the time to go to the library and look everything up. And it helped me enormously. And in some sense, AI could\nbe that in a very nice world. It could be a tool that helps us go a step\nfurther than we would and a lot more efficiently. And it's already done that to some extent. Or it could be like the\nparts of the internet that we can't control,\nruining politics or whatever. And there's certainly a lot of\nindications that can do that. Then there are even bigger things that people speculate about, about AI being able to do its own things. But in terms of actually\nfiguring things out, we're in the early stages. - Yeah, there's several directions here. One is like on the theorem\nprover side, so WolframAlpha, where everything's much more precise, and we have large language\nmodel type of stuff. One of the limitations of\nthose is it seems to come up with convincing-looking things, which we don't know if it's true or not. - [Lisa] Right. - And that's a big problem for physics. - So large language models are more or less like generalizations\nof stuff that we have. So the question is, so\nthere's still breakthroughs in AI waiting to happen, and\nmaybe they are happening. And maybe they'll be good, maybe not, but that's not quite the same. I mean, maybe in some cases, it's just pattern recognition that leads to important things. But sometimes it could be\nsomething more insightful than that, that I can't\neven put my finger on. So it forces us to, I mean, we don't really\nunderstand how smart we are. We don't understand how\nwe think about things all that well actually. But one thing is true, that\nwe are a lot more efficient right now than computers,\nand coming up with things, we require a lot less energy to do that. So if computers figure out how to do that, then it's gonna be a\ntotally different ball game. And so there are clearly\nkinds of connections that we don't know how we're\nmaking, but we are making them. And so that's going to be interesting. So, I say we're in early stages, but this is changing very rapidly. But right now, I don't\nthink that it's actually, we discovered like new laws of physics, but could it in the future? Maybe it can. - It will raise big questions about, what is special about humans\nthat we don't quite appreciate? There could be things that are like, that leap of insight that\nhappens, truly novel ideas that could potentially\nbe very difficult to do. - So there are sort of\nabstract questions like that. There's also questions of\nhow is it that we can address to some extent, how will\nAI be used in the context of the world we live\nin, which is based on, at least our countries based on capitalism in a certain political system. And how will global politics deal with it? How will our capitalist\nsystem deal with it? What will be the things that\nwe focus on doing with it? How much will researchers\nget control of it to be able to ask different\nsorts of questions? I mean, while it was starting out, people were doing these\nkind of toy problems, but what will it actually be applied to, and what will it be optimized to do? There's a lot of questions out there that it's really important\nwe start addressing. - What to you is the most\nbeautiful unsolved problem in physics and cosmology? What to you is really\nexciting if we can unlock the mystery of in the next few decades? - So is it, what's the most\nbeautiful unsolved problem, or what is the most\nbeautiful unsolved problem I think we can make progress on? (Lex laughs) - Oh, boy. We make progress on in\nthe next few centuries. (Lisa chuckles) - Most of the questions, the big questions have to do with what underlies things, how things started,\nwhat's at the base of it. There's also just basic\nquestions that you asked earlier, how far will science take us? How much can we understand? There are questions like how we got here, what underlies it? But also, I mean there's\nreally deep questions like what fraction are we actually seeing, if there are these other forces, if there is another way\nof seeing the world? Are there universes beyond our own there? If they're so totally different, how do we even comprehend them? I mean, how do we detect, like what would we even think about them? So there's a lot about\ntrying to get beyond, it's always just getting\nbeyond our limited vision and limited experience and\ntrying to see what underlies it, both at small scales and at large scales. We just don't know the answers. I mean, I'd like to think\nthat we understand more about dark matter, about dark energy, about are there extra dimensions, things that we actually work on. But there's probably a\nlot beyond what we work on that's yet to be discovered. - Yeah, understanding the\nextra dimensions piece will be really interesting. - Totally. I mean, if it is how the universe went from higher dimensions to what we see, are the extra dimensions\npresent everywhere? I mean, one of the\nreally interesting pieces of physics we did that I\ntalk about in my first book, \"Warped Passages,\" is finding out that there can be a higher\ndimension, but only locally do you think there's a\ngravity of a lower dimension. So it could be like\nonly locally do we think we live in three dimensions. It could be higher\ndimensions is different. That's not actually the gravity we have, but there's all sorts of\nphenomena that might be out there that we don't know about. All sorts of evolution things, time dependence that we don't know about. And of course, that's\nfrom the point of view of particle physics,\nfrom the point of view of other kinds of physics. We're just beginning, so who knows? - Yeah, if the physics changes throughout, is not homogeneous\nthroughout the universe, that'll be weird. - I mean, for the observable universe, it's the same, but beyond\nthe observable universe, who knows? - What advice would you give? You've had an exceptional career. What advice would you\ngive to young people, maybe high school, college, on how to have a career\nthey can be proud of and a life they can be proud of? - I think the weird thing\nabout being a scientist or an academic in general is you have to believe\nreally strongly what you do while questioning it all the time. And that's a hard balance to have. Sometimes it helps to\ncollaborate with people. But to really believe that\nyou could have good ideas at the same time knowing\nthey could all be wrong, that's a tough tightrope\nto walk sometimes. But to really test them out. The other thing is sometimes,\nif you get too far buried, you look out and you think, oh, there's so much out there. And sometimes it's just\ngood to bring it back home and just think, okay,\ncan I have as good idea as the person next to me rather\nthan the greatest physicist who ever lived? But right now, like you said, I think there's lots of\nbig issues out there, and it's hard to balance that. And sometimes it's hard to\nforget the role of physics. But I think, Wilson said it\nreally well when he said, when they were building Fermilab, it was like, this won't\ndefend the country, but it'll make it worth defending. There's just the idea\nthat, in all this chaos, it's still important that\nwe still make progress in these things. And sometimes, when major\nworld events are happening, it's easy to forget that. And I think those are important too. You don't wanna forget those\nbut to try to keep that balance because we don't wanna lose what it is that makes humans special. - So that's the big picture. Do you also lose yourself in the simple joy of puzzle solving? - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we all like solving puzzles. And actually, one of the\nthings that drives me in my research is the inconsistencies. When things don't make\nsense, it really bugs me. And I just will go into\ndifferent directions to see how could these\nthings fit together. - So it bugs you, but that motivates you. - [Lisa] Yeah, totally. - Until it doesn't. - Because I think,\n- Just to resolve it. - I have this underlying belief\nthat it should make sense, - Yeah.\n- even though the world comes at you in many ways and tells you nothing should make sense. But if you believe that it makes sense, then you look for underlying logic. And I think that's just\ngood advice for everything, to try to find like why\nit is the way it is. I talk about effective\ntheory in my second book, \"Knocking on Heaven's Door,\" a lot. Rather than ask the big\nquestions, sometimes we just ask the questions about the immediate things that we can measure. Like I said, we can sometimes\ntell one that we'll fail, but we can have these effective theories. And sometimes I think, when we\napproach these big questions, it's good to do it from\nan effective theory point. Why do I find this satisfying? Why is the world we have the way it is? We think things are\nbeautiful that we live in. I mean, I'm not sure, if we had different senses or different ways of looking at things, we wouldn't necessarily find it beautiful. But I have to say, it is kind of fantastic that no matter how many\ntimes I see a sunset, I will always find it beautiful. It's like, I don't think I ever\nsee a sunset as a whatever. It's just always beautiful. And so there are things, as humans, clearly resonate with us, but we were maybe evolved that way. But that's about us. But in terms of figuring out the universe, it's kind of amazing how far we've gotten. We have discovered many,\nmany wonderful things, but there's a lot more out there. And I hope we have the\nopportunity to keep going. - And with effective theories,\none small step at a time. Just keep unraveling the mystery. - But also having in\nmind the big questions, but doing one small\nstep at a time, exactly. - Yeah, looking out to the stars. You said, the sunset. For me, it's the sunset, the sunrise, and just looking at the stars. It's wondering what's all out there and having a lot of hope that\nhumans will figure it out. - Right. I like it. - Lisa, well, thank you\nfor being one of the humans - Well, thank you - in a world\n- for having me here. - that are pushing it forward and figuring out this\nbeautiful puzzle of ours. And thank you for talking today. This is amazing. - Thank you. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Lisa Randall. To support this podcast,\nplease check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein. \"The important thing is\nto not stop questioning. Curiosity has its own\nreason for existence.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
