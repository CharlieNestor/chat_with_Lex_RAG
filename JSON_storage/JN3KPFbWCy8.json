      "text": "(Elon whistling) I thought you were gonna finish it. (Elon whistling) It's one of the greatest\nthemes in all film history. (whistling continues) - Yeah, that's great. - So I was just thinking\nabout the Roman Empire. As one does.\n(Elon laughing) - There's that whole meme where old guys are thinking about the Roman\nEmpire at least once a day. - And half the population's confused whether it's true or not. But more seriously thinking about the wars going on in the world today. And as you know, war and military conquest has been a big part of\nRoman society and culture. And it, I think, has been\na big part of most empires and dynasties throughout\nhuman history, so. - Yeah, they usually came\nas a result of conquest. I mean, there's some,\nlike the Hungarian Empire where there was just a lot\nof sort of clever marriages. - But fundamentally there's\nan engine of conquest. They celebrate excellence in warfare. Many of the leaders\nwere excellent generals. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- That kind of thing. So a big picture question, Grok approved, I asked if this is a good question to ask. - [Elon] Get tested Grok approved. - Yeah. At least on fun mode. (Elon laughing) To what degree do you think\nwar is part of human nature versus a consequence of how human societies are structured? I ask this as you have\nsomehow controversially been a proponent of peace. - I'm generally a proponent of peace. I mean, ignorance is perhaps, in my view, the real\nenemy to be countered. That's the real hard part. Not, you know, fighting other humans. But all creatures fight. I mean, the jungle is a, you look at the, people\nthink of this nature as perhaps some sort of peaceful thing. But in fact it is not. There's some quite funny\nWerner Herzog thing where he is like in the jungle, like saying that it's\nlike basically just murder and death in every direction. I mean, the plants, animals in the jungle are constantly trying to kill each other, every single day, every minute. So it's not like, you know,\nwe're unusual in that respect. - Well, there's a relevant question here. Whether with greater intelligence\ncomes greater control over these base instincts for violence. - Yes. We have much more\nvulnerability to control our limbic instinct for violence\nthan say a chimpanzee. And in fact, if one looks and say, chimpanzee society, it is not friendly. I mean, the Bonobos are an exception, but chimpanzee society\nis filled with violence. And it's quite, quite horrific, frankly, that that's our limbic system in action. Like, you don't wanna be on\nthe wrong side of a chimpanzee, they'll eat your face off\nand tear and nuts off. - Yeah, basically, there's\nno limits or ethics or there almost had just war. There's no just war in\nchimpanzee societies, is war and dominance\nby any means necessary. - Yeah, chimpanzee society is a pro, like a permanent version of human society. They're not like peace\nloving basically at all. There's extreme violence. And then once in a while, somebody who's watched\ntoo many Disney movies decides to raise a chimpanzee as a pet, and then that eats their\nface or rip their nuts off or chew their fingers off\nand that kind of thing. It's happened several times. - Ripping your nuts off is an interesting strategy for interaction. - It's happened to\npeople. It's unfortunate. Like that's, I guess a one way to ensure that the other chimp\ndoesn't like, you know, contribute to the gene pool. - Well, from a martial arts perspective is the fascinating strategy. - (laughing) The nut riper. (laughing) - I wonder which of the\nmartial arts teaches that one. - I think it's safe to say\nif somebody's got your nuts in their hands and as the\noption ripping them off, you'll be amenable to whatever they want. - Yeah.\n(Elon laughing)"

      "section": "Israel-Hamas war",
      "text": "- So like I said, somehow controversially, you've been an proponent\nof peace on Twitter, on X. - Yeah. - So let me ask you about\nthe wars going on today and to see what the\npath to peace could be. How do you hope the current war in Israel and Gaza comes to an end? What path do you see that can minimize human suffering in the long term in\nthat part of the world? - Well, I think that part of\nthe world is definitely like, if you look up the,\nthere is no easy answer in the dictionary. It'll be that, like the\npicture of the Middle East, in Israel especially. So there is no easy answer. What my, this is strictly\nmy opinion of, you know, is that the goal of Hamas was to provoke an\noverreaction from Israel. They obviously did not\nexpect to, you know, have a military victory, but they expect, they really wanted to\ncommit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response\npossible from Israel. And then leverage that aggressive response to rally Muslims worldwide for the course of Gaza and Palestine, which they have succeeded in doing. So the counterintuitive thing here, I think that the thing that\nI think should be done, even though it's very difficult, is that I would recommend that Israel engage in the most conspicuous\nacts of kindness possible. Every po- everything. That is the actual thing that we're taught the goal of Hamas. - So in some sense, the degree that makes sense in geopolitics turn the other cheek implemented. - It's not exactly turn the other cheek. Because I do think that there's, you know, I think it is appropriate for Israel to find the Hamas members and, you know, either kill\n'em or incarcerate them. Like that's something that's\nsomething has to be done 'cause they're just gonna\nkeep coming otherwise. But in addition to that, they\nneed to do whatever they can. There's some talk of establishing, for example, a mobile hospital. I'd recommend doing that. Just making sure that, you know, there's food, water, medical, necessities, and just be over the top about it and be very transparent. So you can't claim it's a trick. Like just put webcam on the\nthing, you know, or 24/7. - Deploy acts of kindness.\n- Yeah. Conspicuous acts of kindness that, with that are unequivocal. Meaning they can't be somehow, because Hamas will then, their response will be, oh, it's a trick. Therefore you have to\ncounter how it's not a trick. - This ultimately fights the broader force of hatred in the region. - Yes. And I'm not sure who said it,\nit's an apocryphal saying, but an eye for an eye\nmakes everyone blind. Now that neck of the woods, they really believe in the\nwhole eye for an eye thing. But I mean, you really have, if you're not gonna just\noutright commit genocide, like against an entire people, which obviously would not\nbe acceptable to really shouldn't be acceptable to anyone, then you're gonna leave\nbasically a lot of people alive who subsequently, you know, hate Israel. So really the question is like, how, for every Hamas member that you kill, how many did you create? And if you create more than you killed, you've not succeeded. That's the, you know,\nthe real situation there. And it's safe to say that if, you know, if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you've made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli. That's the situation. So, but I mean, this is one of the most\ncontentious subjects one could possibly discuss. But I think if the goal ultimately is some sort of long-term peace, one has to be, look at this\nfrom the standpoint of, over time, are there more or\nfewer terrorists being created? - Let me just linger on war. - Yeah, war safe to say, wars always existed and always will exist. - [Lex] Always will exist, - Always has existed\nand always will exist. - I hope not. You think it always will? - There will always be war. This question of just how much war. And, you know, there's this, there's this sort of the\nscope and scale of war. But to imagine that there\nwould not be any war in the future, I think would\nbe a very unlikely outcome. - Yeah you talked about\nthe Culture series. There's war even there. - Yes. It's a giant war. The first book starts off\nwith a gigantic galactic war where trillions die, trillions. - But it still nevertheless\nprotects these pockets of flourishing. Somehow you can have galactic war and still have pockets of flourishing. - Yeah. I mean it's, I guess if we\nare able to one day expand to, you know, the galaxy or whatever, there will be a galactic\nwar at some point. - The scale, I mean the scale\nof war has been increasing, increasing, increasing. It's like a race between\nthe scale of suffering and the scale of flourishing. - Yes."

      "section": "Military-Industrial Complex",
      "text": "- A lot of people seem\nto be using this tragedy to beat the drums of war and feed the military industrial complex. Do you worry about this? The people who are rooting for escalation and how can it be stopped? - One of the things that did concerned me is that there are very\nfew people alive today who actually viscerally\nunderstand the horrors of war, at least in the US. I mean, obviously there are\npeople in on the front lines in Ukraine and Russia who understand just how terrible war is, but how many people in\nthe west understand it? And my grandfather was in World War II. He was severely traumatized. He was there, I think for\nalmost six years in the, in eastern North Africa and Italy. All his friends were\nkilled in front of him. And he would've died too,\nexcept they randomly gave some, I guess, IQ test or something. And he scored very high. And he was not an officer, he was a, I think a corporal or a\nsergeant or something like that. Because he didn't finish high school because he had to drop outta high school, 'cause his dad died and he had to work to support his siblings. So because he didn't graduate high school, he was not eligible for the officer corps. So, you know, he kind of got\nput into the cannon fodder category, basically. But then, this, randomly\nthey gave him this test. He was transferred to British\nintelligence in London. That's where he met my grandmother. But he had PTSD next\nlevel, like next level. I mean, just didn't\ntalk, just didn't talk. And if you tried talking to him, he'd just tell you to shut up. And he won a bunch of medals. Never bragged about it once,\nnot even hinted, nothing. I like found out about it, 'cause his military records were online. That's how I know. So he would say like, no way in hell do you wanna do that again. But how many people, now\nhe obviously he died, you know, 20 years ago or\nlonger, actually 30 years ago. How many people are alive\nthat remember World War II? Not many. - And the same perhaps applies\nto the threat of nuclear war. - Yeah. I mean, there\nare enough nuclear bombs pointed at United States\nto make the revel, the radio active revel balance many times. - There's two major\nwars going on right now. So you talked about the\nthreat of AGI quite a bit. But now as we sit here with the intensity of conflict going on, do\nyou worry about nuclear war? - I think we shouldn't\ndiscount the possibility of nuclear war. It is a civilizational threat. Right now I could be wrong, but I think the current\nprobability of nuclear war is quite low. But there are a lot of\nnukes pointed at us. So, and we have a lot of\nnukes pointed at other people. They're still there.\nNobody's put their guns away. The missiles are still in the silos. - And the leaders don't\nseem to be the ones with the nukes talking to each other. - No. There are wars which are tragic and difficult on a local basis. And then there are wars\nwhich are civilization ending or has that potential. Obviously global thermonuclear\nwarfare has high potential to end civilization, perhaps permanently. But certainly, you know, to severely wound and perhaps set back human progress by, you know, to the stone age\nor something, I don't know. Pretty bad. Probably scientists and\nengineers wanna be super popular after that as well. And like you got us into this mess. - So generally I think we\nobviously wanna prioritize civilizational risks over\nthings that are painful and tragic on a local level,\nbut not civilizational."

      "section": "War in Ukraine",
      "text": "- How do you hope the war\nin Ukraine comes to an end? And what's the path, once again to minimizing human suffering there? - Well, I think that\nwhat is likely to happen, which is really pretty much the way it is, is that something very close\nto the current lines will be how a ceasefire or truth happens. But, you know, you just\nhave a situation right now where whoever goes on the\noffensive will suffer casualties at several times the rate\nof whoever's on the defense. 'Cause you've got defense in depth, you've got minefields,\ntrenches, anti-tank defenses. Nobody has air superiority. 'cause the anti-aircraft missiles are really far better than the aircraft. Like, they're far more of them. And so neither side has air superiority. Tanks are basically death\ndrafts, just slow moving and they're not immune\nto anti-tank weapons. So you really just have\nlong range artillery and infantry ranges. It's World War I all over\nagain with drones, you know, throwing old drones, some drones there. - Which makes the long range artillery just that much more accurate and better and so more efficient at\nmurdering people on both sides. - Yeah. So it's whoever is, you\ndon't wanna be trying to advance from either side, 'cause the probability of\ndying is incredibly high. So in order to overcome defense in depth trenches and minefields, you\nreally need a significant local superiority in numbers. Ideally combined alms\nwhere you do a fast attack with aircraft, a\nconcentrated number of tanks and a lot of people. That's the only way you're\ngonna punch through the line. And then you're gonna punch through and then not have\nreinforcements just kick you right out again. I mean, I really recommend people read World War I warfare in detail. That's rough. I mean, the sheer number\nof people that died there was mind boggling. - And it's almost impossible\nto imagine the end of it that doesn't look like almost\nexactly like the beginning in terms of what land\nbelongs to who and so on. But on the other side of a\nlot of human suffering death and destruction of infrastructure. - Yes. I mean, the thing that, the reason I, you know, proposed some sort of truce or peace a year ago was because I've predicted\npretty much exactly what would happen, which\nis a lot of people dying for basically almost no changes in land. And this, the loss of the flower of Ukrainian and Russian youth. And we should have some\nsympathy for the Russian boys as well as the Ukrainian boys, 'cause they, Russian boys didn't ask to be on their front line, they have to be. So there's a lot of sons not\ncoming back to their parents, you know, and I think most\nof 'em don't really have, they don't hate the other side. You know, it's sort of like\nas this saying about, like, this saying comes from World\nWar I, it's like young boys who don't know each\nother, killing each other on behalf of old men\nthat do know each other. The hell's the point of that? - So Vladimir Zelensky said that he's not, or has said in the past, he's not interested in\ntalking to Putin directly. Do you think he should? - Yeah.\n- Sit down man to man, lead a leader and negotiate peace? - Look, I think I would just recommend do not send the flower of Ukrainian youth to die in trenches. Whether he talks to Putin\nor not, just don't do that. Whoever goes on the offensive will lose massive numbers of people and history will not\nlook kindly upon them."

      "section": "China",
      "text": "- You've spoken honestly\nabout the possibility of war between US and China in the long term. If no diplomatic solution\nis found, for example, on the question of Taiwan\nand one China policy. - [Elon] Right. - How do we avoid the trajectory where these two superpowers clash? - Well, it's worth reading that book on the, difficult to\npronounce, the Thucydides trap, I believe it's called. I love war history. I like\ninside out and backwards. There's hardly a battle\nI haven't read about. And trying to figure out like\nwhat really was the cause of victory in any\nparticular case as opposed to what one side or\nanother claim the reason. - Both the victory and\nwhat sparked the war? - Yeah, yeah,\n- [Lex] The whole thing. - Yeah, so that Athens and\nSparta is a classic case. The thing about the Greek is they really wrote down a lot of stuff. They loved writing. You know, there are lots\nof interesting things that happened in many parts of the world, but people didn't write down. (laughing) So we don't know what happened, or they didn't really\nwrite with in detail. They just would say like,\nwe had a battle and we won. And like, well what?\nCan you add a bit more? The Greeks, they really\nwrote a lot. (laughing) They were very articulate\non, they just love writing. So, and we have a bunch of\nthat writing as preserved. So we know what led up\nto the Peloponnesian War between the Spartan and Athenian alliance. And we know that they saw it coming. I mean, the Spartans didn't write, they also weren't very\nverbose by their nature, but they did write, but\nthey weren't very verbose. They were terse. But the Athenians and the\nother Greeks wrote a line and they were like, and\nSparta was really kinda like the leader of Greece. But Athens grew stronger and stronger with each passing year. And everyone's like,\nwell that's inevitable that there's gonna be a clash\nbetween Athens and Sparta. Well, how do we avoid that? And they couldn't. They actually, they saw it coming and they still could\nnot avoid it. (laughing) So, you know, at some point\nif there's, if one group, one civilization or country or whatever exceeds another, sort of, like, you know, the United States has been the\nbiggest kid on the block for, since I think around 1890\nfrom an economic standpoint. So the United States\nhas been the economic, most powerful economic\nengine in the world, longer than anyone's been alive. And the foundation of war is economics. So now we have a situation in the case of China where the economy\nis likely to be two, perhaps three times larger\nthan that of the US. So imagine you're the\nbiggest kid on the block for as long as anyone can remember. And suddenly a kid comes\nalong who's twice your size. - So we see it coming.\n- [Elon] Yeah. - How is it possible to stop? Is there some, let me\nthrow something out there, just intermixing of\ncultures understanding. There does seem to be a giant cultural gap in understanding of each other. And you're an interesting case study because you are an American,\nobviously you've done a lot of incredible manufacture\nhere in the United States, but you also work with China. - I've spent a lot of time in China and met with the leadership many times. - Maybe a good question to ask is, what are some things about China that people don't understand\npositive, just in the culture? What's some interesting things that you've learned about the Chinese? - Well, the sheer number of really smart, hardworking people in China is incredible. There are really, say like how many smart, hardworking people are there in China, there's far more of them\nthere than there are here. I think in my opinion. And they've got a lot of energy. So I mean, the architecture in China that's in recent years is far\nmore impressive than the US. I mean the train stations, the buildings, the high speed rail, everything, it's really far more impressive\nthan what we have in the US. I mean, I recommend\nsomebody just go to Shanghai and Beijing, look at the buildings and go to, you know, take the\ntrain from Beijing to Xian, where you have the terracotta warriors. China's got an incredible\nhistory, very long history. And you know, I think arguably the, in terms of the use of language\nfrom a written standpoint, sort of one of the oldest, perhaps the oldest written language. And then China, people\ndid write things down. So now China historically has always been, with rare exception,\nbeen internally focused. They have not been inquisitive. They've fought each other. There've been many, many civil wars. In the three kingdoms war, I believe they lost about\n70% of their population. So, and that, so they've had brutal internal wars, like civil wars that make the US Civil War look small by comparison. So I think it's important to appreciate that China is not monolithic. We sort of think of like China as this sort of one entity of one mind. And this is definitely not the case from what I've seen, and I think most people who\nunderstand China would agree. People in China think about China 10 times more than they think about anything outside of China. So it's like 90% of\ntheir consideration is, you know, our is internal. - Well, isn't that a really positive thing when you're talking\nabout the collaboration and a future piece between superpowers, when you're inward facing, which is like focusing\non improving yourself versus focusing on...\n- [Elon] Yeah. - \"Improving\" others\nthrough military might. - The good news, the\nhistory of China suggests that China is not inquisitive. Meaning they're not gonna go out and invade a whole bunch of countries. Now they do feel very strongly, you know, so that's good. I mean, 'cause a lot of\nvery powerful countries have been inquisitive. The US is one of the,\nalso one of the rare cases that has not been inquisitive. Like after World War II, the US could have basically taken over the world in any country. Like, we've got nukes,\nnobody else has got nukes. We don't even have to lose soldiers. Which country do you want? And the United States could\nhave taken over everything. Oh wait, at will. And it didn't, and the\nUnited States actually helped rebuild countries. So it helped rebuild Europe,\nyou know, helped rebuild Japan. This is very unusual behavior,\nalmost unprecedented. You know, the US did\nconspicuous acts of kindness like the Berlin airlift, you know? And I think, you know, it's always like, well, America's done bad things. Well, of course America's done bad things. But one needs to look at\nthe whole track record. And just generally, you\nknow, one sort of test would be how do you treat\nyour prisoners at war? Or let's say, you know, no offense to the Russians, but\nlet's say you're in Germany, it's 1945, you got the\nRussian Army coming one side and you got the French, British, and American Army's coming the other side. Who would you like to\nbe to surrender it to? Like, no country is like morally perfect, but I recommend being a\nPOW with the Americans. That would be my choice\nvery strongly. (laughing) - In the full menu of POWs. - Very much so. And in fact, Wernher von Braun, took, you know, smart guy was like, we've got to be captured by the Americans. And in fact, the SS was under\norders to execute Von Braun and all of the German rocket initiatives. And they narrowly escaped their SS. They said they were going\nout for a walk in the woods. They left in the middle\nof winter with no coats. And they ran like, with no\nfood, no coats, no water. And just ran like hell and ran west. And by Sherlock, they, I\nthink his brother found like a bicycle or something, and then just cycled west as fast as he couldn't have found a US patrol. So anyway, that's one way\nyou can tell morality is. Where do you wanna be PoW? (laughing) It's not fun anywhere, but some places are\nmuch worse than others. So anyways, so like America has been, while far from perfect,\ngenerally a benevolent force, and we should always be self-critical and we try to be better. But anyone with have brain knows that. So I think there are some, in this way China and the\nUnited States are similar. Neither country has been\nacquisitive in a significant way. So that's like a, you know,\na shared principle I guess. Now China does feel very\nstrongly about Taiwan. They've been very clear\nabout that for a long time. You know, from their standpoint, it would be like one of\nthe states is, you know, not there like Hawaii\nor something like that. But more significant\nthan Hawaii, you know? And Hawaii is pretty significant for us. So they view it as really the, that there's a fundamental part of China. The islander Formosa not Taiwan, that is not part of China, but should be. And the only reason it hasn't been is 'cause the US Pacific Fleet. - And as their economic power grows and as their military power grows, the thing that they're clearly saying is their interest will, you\nknow, clearly be materialized. - Yes. China has been very clear that\nthey'll incorporate Taiwan peacefully or militarily, but that they will incorporate it from their standpoint is 100% likely. - You know, something you\nsaid about conspicuous acts of kindness. As a geopolitical policy,\nit almost seems naive, but I'd venture to say\nthat this is probably the path forward, how you avoid most wars. Just as you say it, it sounds naive, but it's kind of brilliant. If you believe in the goodness of underlying most of human nature. It just seems like it\nconspicuous acts of kindness can reverberate through the populace of the countries involved. - Yeah, well.\n- [Lex] And deescalate. - Absolutely. So after World War I,\nthey made a big mistake. You know, they basically tried to lump all of lamb on Germany and, you know, settled Germany with impossible reparations. And, you know, really, there was a lot of, there was a fair, quite a bit of blame to go around for World War I, but they try to, you know,\nput it all in Germany. And that was, that laid\nthe seeds for World War II. So it's a lot of people\nwere not just Hitler, a lot of people felt wronged and they wanted vengeance and they got it. - [Lex] People don't forget. - Yeah, you know, you\nkill somebody's father or mother or son, daughter,\nthey're not gonna forget it. They'll want vengeance. So after World War II, they're like, well, the Treaty of Versailles was\na huge mistake in World War I. And so this time, instead of, you know, crushing the losers, we're actually gonna help\n'em with the Marshall Plan and we're gonna help rebuild Germany. We're gonna help rebuild\nor, you know, Austria and the other, you know,\nItaly and whatnot, so. And that was the right move. - There's a, it does feel\nlike there's a profound truth to conspicuous acts of kindness\nbeing an antidote to this. - Something must stop the\ncycle of reciprocal violence. Something must stop it or it will, you know, it'll never stop. Just eye for an eye, tooth for tooth, limb for a limb, life for\na life, forever and ever"

      "section": "xAI Grok",
      "text": "- To escape briefly, the darkness was some\nincredible engineering work. xAI just released Grok AI assistant that I've gotten a chance to play with. It's amazing on many levels. First of all, it's amazing\nthat a relatively small team in a relatively short amount\nof time was able to develop this close to state-of-the art system. Another incredible thing\nis there's a regular mode and there's a fun mode. - Yeah. I guess I'm to blame\nfor that one. (laughing) - I wish, first of all, I wish everything in life had a fun mode. - Yeah. - There's something compelling beyond just fun about the fun mode interacting with a large language model. I'm not sure exactly what it is 'cause I only have had a little\nbit of time to play with it. But it just makes it more interesting, more vibrant to interact with the system. - Yeah, absolutely. Our AI Grok is modeled after the Hitchhiker's\nGuide to the Galaxy, which is one of my\nfavorite books, which is, it's a book on philosophy,\ndisguises book on humor. And I would say that\nis that forms the basis of my philosophy, which is that we don't know the meaning of life, but the more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, digital and biological, the\nmore we're able to understand what questions to ask about the\nanswer that is the universe. So I have a philosophy of curiosity. - There is generally a\nfeeling like this AI system has an outward looking, like the way you are, like sitting with a good friend\nlooking up at the stars, like the asking pod head, like\nquestions about the universe, wondering what it's all about. The curiosity you talk about. There's a sense no matter how\nmundane the question I ask, there's a sense of cosmic\ngrandeur to the whole thing. - Well we are actually working\nhard to have engineering math, physics answers\nthat you can count on. So for the other sort of AIs out there that these so-called\nlarge language models, I've not found the\nengineering to be reliable. And the hallucination, it unfortunately hallucinates most when you at least want it to hallucinate. So when you're asking\nimportant difficult questions, that that's where it tends\nto be confidently wrong. So we're really trying hard to say, okay, how do we be as grounded as possible so you can count on the results? Trace things back to\nphysics first principles, mathematical logic. So underlying the humor is an aspiration to adhere to the truth of the universe as closely as possible. - [Lex] That's really tricky.\n- It is tricky. So that's why, you know, there's always gonna be\nsome amount of error, but we want to aspire to be as truthful as possible about the answers with acknowledged error. So that there was always, you\ndon't wanna be confidently wrong, so you're not\ngonna be right every time, but you wanna minimize how often you're confidently wrong. And then like I said, once\nyou can count on the logic as being not violating physics, then you can start to build on that, to create inventions, like\ninvent new technologies. But if you can't, if you cannot count on the foundational\nphysics being correct, obviously the inventions\nare simply wishful thinking, you know, imagination\nland, magic basically. - Well, as you said, I\nthink one of the big goals of xAI is to understand the universe. - Yes. That's how simple\nthree word mission. (laughing) - If you look out far into the future, do you think on this level of physics, the very edge of what we\nunderstand about physics, do you think it will make discoveries, sort of the sexiest discovery\nof them as we know now, sort of unifying general\nrelativity and quantum mechanics. So coming up with a theory of everything, do you think it could push\ntowards that direction? Almost like theoretical\nphysics discoveries. - If an AI cannot figure out new physics, it's clearly not equal to humans, let alone nor has surpassed humans, 'cause humans have\nfigured out new physics. They're just, you know,\nphysics is just understanding, you know, deepening wants\ninsight into how reality works. And then there's engineering\nwhich is inventing things that have never existed. Now the range of\npossibilities for engineering is far greater than for physics. 'Cause you know, once\nyou figure out the rules of the universe, that's it. You've discovered things\nthat already existed. But from that you can\nthen build technologies with that are really almost limitless in the variety and cap- you know? It's like once you understand the rules of the game properly, and we do, you know, with current physics, we do\nat least at a local level, understand how physics works very well. Where our ability to predict\nthings is incredibly good. Like quantum mechanics is, the degree to which quantum\nmechanics can predict outcomes is incredible. That was my heart hardest\nclass in college by the way. My senior quantum\nmechanics class was harder than all of my other classes put together. - To get an AI system,\na large language model to reliably, be as reliable\nas quantum mechanics and physics is very difficult. - Yeah. You have to test any\nconclusions against the ground, truth of reality. Reality is the ultimate judge. Like physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation. I've seen plenty of people\nbreak the laws made by man, but none break the laws made by physics. - Yeah, it's a good test actually. If this LLM understands and matches physics, then\nyou can more reliably trust whatever it thinks about the current state of politics in some sense. - And it's also not the case currently that even that its internal\nlogic is not consistent. So, especially with these, with the approach of like just\npredicting a token, predict, token, predict, token,\nit's like a vector sum. You know, you're summing\nup a bunch of vectors, but you can get drift. So as those, a little bit of error, a little bit of error adds up. And by the time you are\nmany tokens down the path, it doesn't make any sense. - So it has to be somehow\nself-aware about the drift. - It has to be self-aware about the drift, and then look at the thing\nas a gestalt as a whole and say it does it have\ncoherence as a whole. So, you know, when authors write books that they will write the\nbook and then they'll go and revise it, you know,\ntaking into account, you know, all the, the\nend and the beginning and the middle and rewrite\nit to achieve coherence so that it doesn't end up\nin a nonsensical place. - [Lex] Maybe the process\nof revising is what... - Yeah. - Reasoning is, and then\nthat's the process of revising is how you get closer and closer to truth. Maybe you, like, at least\nI approached it that way. You just say a bunch of bullshit first and then you get it better. You start a bullshit and then you get... - Create a draft and then\nyou iterate on that draft until it has has coherence, until it all adds up basically. - So another question\nabout theory of everything, but for intelligence, do\nyou think there exists as you're exploring this with xAI, creating this intelligence system, do you think there is a\ntheory of intelligence where you get to understand what, like what is the I in AGI and what is the I in human intelligence? - There's no I in Team\nAmerica, oh wait, there is. (both laughing) - No, it's gonna be stuck in my head now. (both laughing) Yeah. There's no me and\nwhatever in quantum mechanics. Oh, wait.\n(Elon laughing) I mean is that part of the\nprocess of discovering, understanding the universe is\nunderstanding intelligence? - Yeah. Yeah. I think we need to\nunderstand intelligence, understand consciousness. I mean there are some sort of\nfundamental questions of like, what is thought? What is emotion? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Is it really just one atom bumping into another atom? It feels like something more than that. So I think we're probably\nmissing some really big things, like some really big things. - Something that'll be\nobvious in retrospect. - [Elon] Yes.\n- Like there's a giant, like you put the whole\nconsciousness, emotion. - Well, some people\nwould quote like a soul, you know, in religion it'd be a soul. Like you feel like you're you, right? I mean, you don't feel like\nyou're just a collection of atoms, but on what\ndimension does thought exist? What dimension does do emotions exist? We feel them very strongly. I suspect there's more to it\nthan atoms bumping into atoms. - And maybe AI can pave\nthe path to the discovery of whatever the hell that thing is. - Yeah. What is consciousness? Like what are, when you put the\natoms in a particular shape, why are they able to form thoughts and take actions, that and feelings. - And even if it is an illusion, why is this illusion so compelling? - Yeah. Like how do... - Why does this illusion exist? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- On what plain does this illusion exist? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And sometimes I wonder is, you know, either perhaps\neverything's conscious or nothing is conscious, one of the two. - I like the former, everything conscious just seems more fun. - It does seem more more fun. Yes. But we're composed of atoms and those atoms are composed\nof quarks and leptons. And those quarks and\nleptons have been around since the beginning of the universe. - The beginning of the universe. - Right. What seems to be the\nbeginning of the universe."

      "text": "- The first time we talked,\nyou said what you would, which is surreal to think that this discussion was\nhappening is becoming a reality. I asked you what question\nwould you ask an AGI system once you create it? And you said, what's outside\nthe simulation is the question. And good question. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- But it seems like with Grok you started to literally,\nthe system's goal is to be able to ask such questions, to answer such questions and to ask such questions. - Where are the aliens?\n- [Lex] Where are the aliens? - That's one of the, like\nthe very paradox question. A lot of people have asked me if I've seen any evidence\nof aliens and I haven't, which is kind of concerning. 'Cause then I think\nwhat I'd probably prefer to at least have seen some\narcheological evidence of aliens, to the best of my knowledge,\nthere is no proof. I'm not aware of any evidence of aliens. If they're out there, they're very subtle. We might just be the only consciousness, at least in the galaxy. And if you look at say\nthe history of Earth, forensically the archeological record, Earth is about four and\na half billion years old. Civilization as measured\nfrom the first writing is only about 5,000 years old. We have to give some credit\nthere to the ancient Sumerians who aren't around anymore. I think it was a archaic, pre cuneiform was the first\nactual symbolic representation, but only about 5,000 years ago. I think that's a good date for when word say civilization started. That's one millionth of Earth's existence. So civilization has been around, it's really a flash in the pan so far. And why have we, why\ndid it take so long for, you know, four and a half billion years? For the vast majority of\nthe time, there was no life. And then there was archaic there bacteria for a very long time. And then, you know, you had\nmitochondria get captured, multicellular life. Differentiation into plants and animals. Life moving from the oceans to land. Mammals, higher brain functions. And the sun is expanding slowly, but it will overheat, it will heat the earth up\nat some point in the future, boil the oceans and and\nearth will become like Venus. Where near life, life as\nwe know it is impossible. So if we do not become multi-planetary and ultimately go beyond our solar system, annihilation of all life\non earth is a certainty. A certainty. And it could be as little as\non the galactic timescale, half a billion years. You know, it's long\ntime by human standards, but that's only 10% longer than earth has been around at all. So if life had taken 10%\nlonger to evolve on earth, it wouldn't exist at all. - We got a deadline\ncoming up. Better hurry. But that said, as you said,\nhumans intelligent life on earth developed a lot of cool\nstuff very quickly, - So...\n- [Elon] Yes. - It seems like becoming a multi-planetary is almost inevitable. Unless we destroy this thing.\n- We need to do it. I mean, it's not, I mean,\nI suspect that there, if we are able to go out there and explore other star systems that we, there's a good chance\nwe find a whole bunch of long dead one planet civilizations, then have made it past their home planet. - That's so sad.\n- Yeah. - It's sad. Also fascinating. - I mean, there are various explanations for exploring paradox. And one is the sort of,\nthey're these great vultures, which civilizations don't pass through. And one of those great filters is do you become a multi-plan\ncivilization or not? And if you don't, it's\nsimply a matter of time before something happens on your planet. You know, either natural or manmade that causes us to die out. Like the dinosaurs, where are they now that didn't have\nspaceships, so. (laughing) - I think the more likely thing is, 'cause just to empathize with the aliens that they found us and\nthey're protecting us and letting us be.\n- I hope so. Nice aliens. - Just like the tribes in the Amazon, the uncontacted tribes,\nwe're protecting them. That's what... - That would be a nice explanation. - Or you could have like a, what was it? I think Andrej Karpathy said, it's like the ants in the Amazon\nasking where's everybody? - Well, they do run into\na lot of other ants. - [Lex] That's true.\n- They have these ant wars. - (laughing) Sounds like a good TV show. - Yeah, they literally have these big wars between various ants. - Yeah, maybe I'm just\n(both laughing) dismissing all the\ndifferent diversity events. - You should listen to that Warner Herzog talking about the jungle. It's really hilarious. Have you heard it? - No, I have not.\n- [Elon] It's awesome. - But Warner Herzog is a way... (both laughing) - You should play it for the, you know, as an interlude in the, it's on YouTube. It's awesome.\n(both laughing) - [Lex] I love him so much.\n- Yeah, he's great. - Was he the director of \"Happy People: Life in the Taiga\"? I think also - He did that bear documentary, - [Lex] The bear documentary. - And this thing about penguins. - Yeah.\n(both laughing) The analysis, the\npsychoanalysis of penguins. - Yeah, the penguins like\nheaded for like mountains like that are like 70 miles away. And Penguin has just\nhad for doom basically. - Well, he had a cynical take. I have a, he could be\njust a brave explorer and there'll be great stories told about him amongst the penguin population for many centuries to come. (laughing) What were we talking about? Okay. - [Elon] Penguins.\n(both laughing) - Yeah, so aliens, I mean, I don't know. Look, I think the smart\nmove is just, you know, this is the first time\nin the history of earth that it's been possible for life to extend beyond earth. That window is open. Now, it may be open for a long time or it may be open for a short time and it may be open now\nand then never open again. So I think the smart move here is to make life multiplanetary\nwhile it's possible to do so. We don't wanna be one of those lame one planet civilizations\nthat just dies out. - No, those are lame.\n- Yeah, lame. Self-respecting civilization\nwould be one planet. - There's not gonna be a Wikipedia entry for one of one of those. And pause, the SpaceX\nhave an official policy for when we meet aliens. - No. (laughing) - That seems irresponsible. (both laughing) - I mean, look, if I see\nthe slightest indication that there are aliens, I will immediately post on\nX platform anything I know. - It could be the most liked\nreposted post of all time. - Yeah, I mean look, we have more satellites up there right now than everyone else combined. So, you know, we'd know, we\nknow if we've got a maneuver around something, and we not don't have to\nmaneuver around anything."

You know, they're\ncreatives of this existence and it's incumbent upon\nus to try to understand more about this wondrous creation. - Like who created this thing,\nwho's running this thing? Like embodying it into a singular question with a sexy word on top of it is like focusing the\nmind to understand it. It does seem like there's a,\nagain, it could be an illusion. It seems like there's a purpose that there's an underlying\nmaster plan of some kind. And it seems like... - There may not be a master plan. In the sense, so there's, like, maybe an interesting\nanswer to the question of determinism versus free will is that if we are in a simulation, the reason that these higher\nbeings would hold a simulation is to see what happens. So it's not, they don't know what happens, otherwise they wouldn't\nhold the simulation. So when humans create a simulation, so it's SpaceX and Tesla, we create simulations all the time, especially for the rocket. You, you know, you have to\nrun a lot of simulations to understand what's gonna happen because you can't really test the rocket until it goes to space,\nand you want it to work. So you have to simulate\nsubsonic, transonic, supersonic, hypersonic ascent, and then coming back super high heating and orbital dynamics. All this has gotta be simulated. So, 'cause you don't get\nvery many kicks at the can. But we run the simulations\nto see what happens. Not if we knew what happens,\nwe wouldn't run the simulation. So if there's, so whoever\ncreated this existence, is they're running it because they don't know\nwhat's gonna happen. Not because they do."

They didn't know. - Well, the funny thing\nis the Uber Lilith title is Hatred Incarnate. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And right now, I guess, you're gonna ask the Diablo team, but it's almost impossible\nto defeat hatred in the eternal realm. - Yeah, you've streamed\nyourself dominating tier 100 Nightmare Dungeons and still... - I can cruise through\ntier 100 Nightmare Dungeons like a stroll in the park. - And still you're defeated by Hatred. - Yeah, I can, there's the sort of, I guess maybe the second\nhardest boss is Duriel, Duriel can't even scratch the paint. So I killed Duriel so many times , and every other boss in\nthe game, all of 'em, kill 'em so many times it's easy. But Uber Lilith, otherwise\nknown as Hatred Incarnate, especially if you're a Druid\nand you have no ability to go and to be vulnerable, there are these random death\nwaves that come at you. And I'm pretty, you know, I really am 52, so my reflex is not what they used to be, but I have a lifetime\nof playing video games. At one point I was, you know, maybe one of the best\nQuake players in the world. I actually won money in\nwhat I think was the first paid eSports tournament in the US. We're doing four person Quake tournaments. And we came second, I was the\nsecond best person on the team and the actual best person, we're actually winning, we would've come first except\nthe best person on the team, his computer crashed prior to the game. So we came second. But I got money for it and everything. So like, basically I got\nskills, you know, albeit, you know, no spring chicken these days. And to be totally frank,\nit's driving me crazy, trying to beat Lilith as a Druid. Basically trying to beat,\ntrying to beat Hatred Incarnate in the eternal realm. - [Lex] As a Druid.\n- As a Druid. And if you, if you, (laughing) this is really (indistinct),\nlemme tell you. - I mean, the challenge\nis part of the fun. I have seen directly like you're actually like a world class\nincredible video game player. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- And I think Diablo, so you're just picking up a new game and you're figuring out it's fundamentals. You're also with the Paragon Board and the build are not somebody like me who perfectly follows whatever\nthey suggest on the internet. You're also an innovator there. - [Elon] Yeah. - Which is hilarious to watch. It's like a mad scientist just trying to figure out the Paragon Board and the build and the, you know. Is there some interesting\ninsights there about, if somebody's starting as a\nDruid, do you have advice? - I would not recommend playing a Druid in the eternal realm. Right now, I think the\nmost powerful character in the seasonal realm is the Sorcerer with the lightning balls. The Sorcs have huge balls in the seasonal. - Well yeah, that's what they say. - So Sorc have huge balls. They do, huge balls of lightning. - I'll take you word for it. - And it's actually,\nin the seasonal realm, you can, it's like pretty easy to beat Uber Lilith with the, because she got these vampiric powers that out fire damage and increase your defense and whatnot. So, but really quite easy\nto defeat Hatred seasonally, but to defeat hatred\neternally, very difficult. Almost impossible. It's\ntotally impossible. It seems like this is a\nmetaphor for life, you know? - I like the idea that Elon Musk, because I saw, I was\nplaying Diablo yesterday and I saw 100, level 100 drew just run by, I will never die and\nthen run back the way. - And it was, there's just some, this metaphor's kind\nof hilarious that you, Elon Musk is fighting Hatred, restlessly fighting Hatred\nin this demonic realm. - [Elon] Yes.\n- It's hilarious. I mean it's pretty hilarious. - No, it's absurd.\n(both laughing) Really, it's exercise and absurdity, and it makes me wanna pull my hair out. - Yeah. What do you get\nfrom video games in general? Is there for you personally. - I mean, it's, I don't known it's, it calms my mind. I mean, you sort of killing\nthe demons in a video game calms the demons in my mind. Yeah. If you play a tough video game, you can get into like a state of flow, which is very enjoyable. But the admittedly it\nneeds to be not too easy, not too hard, kinda in the Goldilock zone. And I guess you generally wanna feel like you're progressing in the game. So a good video, and there's also beautiful\nart, engaging storylines, and it's like an amazing\npuzzle to solve, I think. And so it's like solving the puzzle. - Elden Ring the greatest\ngame of all time. I still haven't played it, but you. - Elden Ring is definitely a candidate for best game ever. Top five for sure. - I think I've been scared how hard it is or how hard I hear it is, so. But it is beautiful. - Elden Ring is, feels like\nit's designed by an alien. There's a theme to this\ndiscussion. In what way? - It's so unusual. It's incredibly creative\nand the art is stunning. I recommend playing it\non a big resolution, pie dynamic raise TV even,\ndoesn't need to be a monitor, just the art is incredible. It's so beautiful And it's so unusual. And each of those top\nbus battles is unique. Like, it's like a unique puzzle to solve. Each one is different. And the strategy you use to solve one battle is different\nfrom another battle. - That said, you said Druid and Enternal against Uber Lilith is the\nhardest boss battle you've ever? - Correct. That is currently the, and I've played a lot of video games. That's my primary recreational activity. And yes, beating Hatred\nin the Enternal Realm is the hardest boss battle in life and in the video game. - [Lex] Metaphor on top of metaphor. - I'm not sure it's possible, but it's, I do make progress. So then I'm like, okay,\nI'm making progress. Maybe if I just tweak that\nParagon Board a little more, I can do it. I could just dodge a few\nmore waves, I can do it. - Well the simulation is\ncreated for the purpose of figuring out if it can be done. And you are just a cog in that simulation, in the machine of the simulation. - Yeah it might be.\n(Lex laughing) - I have a feeling that at least, I think...\n- [Lex] it's doable. - It's doable, yes. - [Lex] Well that's the human\nspirit right there to believe. - Yeah. I mean, did prompt me to think\nabout just hate in general, which is, you wanna be\ncareful of one of those things where you wish for\nsomething that sounds good, but if you get it, it's\nactually a dystopian situation. So, you know, you could\nsort of run a, sort of, have heart to sort of like, if you wish for world peace, sounds good, but how is it enforced? And at what cost is, at\nwhat cost eternal peace? It might actually be worse\nto have eternal peace because of what that would entail. The suppression of everyone. It might be the suppression of progress. It might be an ossified\nsociety that never changes. What I'm saying is that\nthere is an argument that you, that if that, if you wish for no war, you should be careful what you wish for. Because what's required in\norder for there to be no war? Might be worse than a little war. - Yeah, the things we'll\nconsider to be flaws of human civilization might\nbe a necessary components for whatever optimal looks like."

(both laughing) - I'm like...\n- [Lex] Lemme take notes. - Did they actually... - Does Grok know about it? No, it probably will\ngo to Brave New World. - We could ask it.\n- What would be the question? - Tell us about the drug called Soma. - Tell us about the drug called Soma. It's gonna go to Brave New World, I think. - Well there's a real drug as well. - Searching for Soma drug information. (both laughing) - Oh boy. Ah, Soma, the one to drug,\nby the way, I'm in fun mode. - Oh, okay. Fun. (laughing) Yeah, so it's talking about the real drug. - [Lex] Oh, it's a muscle relaxant that's been around since the 1950s. It's used to treat muscle\npain and discomfort. And it does this by altering the activity between neurons and the spinal cord. Now, Soma isn't just a pain reliever, it's also a bit of a sedative. It can make you feel a bit drowsy. So it's not something to take if you're planning on\noperating having machinery or trying to solve complex math equations. And it goes on and on. In conclusion, Soma's a\ndrug that can be helpful for those dealing with muscle pain, but it's not without its risks. It's pretty good. Oh, wait a minute. - [Elon] That's the real\ndrug it's talking about. - [Lex] It's the real drug.\n- [Elon] Yeah. - [Lex] And of course the fun\nis always use it responsibly in accordance with the advice\nof a healthcare professional. And remember in the end, the universe is probably just\na giant computer simulation. So don't take anything too seriously. I love it. I love it.\n(Elon laughing) I love it. I love it. - Yeah. So. - Oh, and also really nicely includes like the tweets post on X\nthat are relevant to this, which is really cool. - [Elon] Yeah. - And that integrate everything together. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- Like the interface is one of the really cool things here. - Yeah. Seems done a great job. (laughing) So, and you say like, you\ncould say like, no, I mean, Soma from Brave New World. 'Cause it thinks you mean, you mean Soma the real drug. - Yeah.\n- [Elon] No, I mean, Soma from Brave New World. - It's gonna be like,\noops, I'm really sorry. I'm really surprised it\nwent to the real drug first. Ah, my apologies. I was\nthinking of the muscle relaxant. Soma for Band New World is a\ndifferent beast altogether. Now this Huxley's dystopian novel, Soma is a drug that plays a central role in society, depicted in the book. It's a mood altering,\nhallucinogenic drug that's used to keep the population docile and content. In the novel to use\nSoma in Brave New World raises some interesting questions about the nature of happiness and the role of drugs in society. Oh, man!\n- Exactly. Is it better to live in a world where everyone is happy all the time, even if that happiness is artificial? Good question. This is what I mean. Like, do you want, do\nyou wish for world peace and happiness all the time? Are you sure? Because that might be a society\nthat is essentially sterile and ossified that never changes, that is ultimately doomed. - This kind of tension\nbetween darkness and light. - It's, this is really\na very good summary. It really gets to the point. This is not simply\nregurgitating a Brave New World. It's actually getting\nto the salient element of Soma as a drug. Do you actually wanna be in a situation where everyone is happy all the time, even though it's artificial? Or is it better to confront\nthe challenges of life and experience the full\nrange of human emotions, even if it means experiencing\npain and suffering? - For those listening, by the way, Elon just read directly from Grok, which is a really nice,\nkind of insightful, philosophical analysis\nof the tension here. Interesting. - It pretty much nails it. In conclusion, Soma from Brave\nNew World is fictional drug that's used to explore some\ndeep philosophical questions about the nature of happiness and the role of drugs in society. It's a powerful symbol of\nthe dangers of using drugs to escape from reality and the importance of\nconfronting the challenges of life head-on. Nailed it. And the crazy thing is like, you know, we do have a real drug called Soma, which kind of is kind of\nlike the drug in the book. And I'm like, did they, they must've named it after that Soma. - Probably, probably,\n- Yeah. Soma the real drug is quite\neffective on back pain. - So, you know about this drug? - I've taken it.\n- It's fascinating. Okay. - 'Cause I had like a,\nyou know, squashed disc in my C five C six. - So it takes the physical\npain away, but Soma here is... - It doesn't completely, it\nreduces the amount of pain you feel, but at the\nexpense of mental acuity. It dells your mind. Just the drug in the book. - Just like the drug in the book. - And hence the trade off. The thing that seems like utopia could be a dystopia after all. - Yeah, and actually I was\ntelling a friend of mine saying like, would you really want there to be no hate in the world? Like, really none? Like, I wonder why hate evolved. I'm not saying we should\namplify hate, of course, I think we should try to minimize it. But none at all, hmm. There might be a reason for hate. - And suffering. I mean, it's really complicated\nto consider that some amount of human suffering is necessary\nfor human flourishing. - Is it possible to appreciate the highs without knowing the lows? - And that all is summarized there in a single statement from Grok. Okay.\n- No highs, no lows, who knows? - That's almost the poem."

There's this terminology of\nuseful productivity per watt. Like what have you learned from\npushing the limits of that? - Well, I think it's helpful. The tools of physics are very powerful and can be applied, I think to almost any, really any arena in life. It's really just critical thinking. For something important you need to reason from first principles\nand think about things in the limit one direction or the other. So in the limit, even\nat the Kardashev scale, meaning even if you harness\nthe entire power of the sun, you'll still care about\nuseful compute for what? So that's where, I think probably where things are headed\nfrom the standpoint of AI is that we have a silicon shortage now that will transition to\na voltage transformer shortage in about a year. Ironically, transformers,\nfor transformers. You need transformers to run transformers. - Somebody has a sense\nof humor in this thing. (both laughing) - I think. Yes. Fate loves irony, ironic humor and ironically funny outcome seems to be often what fate wants. - Humor is all you need. I\nthink spice is all you need. Somebody posted. - Yeah, but yeah. So we're, I have silicon shortage today, a voltage step down transformer, shortage probably in about a year. And then just electricity\nshortages in general in about two years. I gave a speech for the sort of world gathering of utility companies, electricity companies, and I said, look, you\nreally need to prepare for a traveling of electricity demand, because all transport\nis gonna go electric, with the ironic exception of rockets. And heating will also go electric. So energy usage right now is roughly one third, very rough terms. One third electricity, one third transport, one third heating. And so in order for\neverything to go sustainable to go electric, you need to triple electricity output. So I encourage the utilities to build more power of plants and also to probably have, well, not probably, they should\ndefinitely buy more batteries because the grid currently\nis sized for real-time load, which is kind of crazy. 'Cause you know, that means\nyou got a size for whatever the peak electricity demand\nis like the worst second or the worst day of the year. Or you can have a brownout or a blackout, and you're at that crazy blackout for several days in Austin. So because there's almost no buffering of energy in the grid. Like if you've got a hydro power plant, you can buffer energy, but\notherwise it's all real time. So with batteries, you can\nproduce energy at night and use it during the\nday so you can buffer. So I expect that there will be\nvery heavy usage of batteries in the future, because the peak to trough\nratio for power plants is anywhere from two to five, you know, so it's like lowest\npoint to highest point. - So like batteries\nnecessary to balance it out? And then, but the\ndemand, as you're saying, is going to grow, grow, grow, grow. - [Elon] Yeah. - And part of that is the compute? - Yes. Yes. I mean, electrification, I mean, electrification of transport and electric heating will\nbe much bigger than AI. - [Lex] At least in the short term? - In the short term. But even for AI, you really have a growing\ndemand for electricity, for electric vehicles, and a\ngrowing demand for electricity for, to run the computers for AI. And so this is obviously leading, can lead to a electricity shortage. - How difficult is the problem of, in this particular case, maximizing the useful\nproductivity per watt for training (indistinct) nuts? Like, this seems to be\nreally where the big problem we're facing that needs to be solved, is how to use the power efficiently. Like what you've learned\nso far about applying this physics first principle\nreasoning in this domain. How difficult is this problem? - It will get solved. It's the question of how\nlong it takes to solve it. So at various points, there's limit, some kind of limiting factor to progress. And with regard to, I'm saying like right\nnow the limiting factor is silicon chips, and that\nwill, we're gonna then have more chips than we can actually plug in and turn on probably in about a year. The initial constraint being literally voltage step down transformers, because you've got power\ncoming in at 300,000 volts, and it's gotta step all the way down eventually to around 0.7 volts. So it's a very big amount of, you know, the voltage step down is gigantic. So, and the industry is\nnot used to rapid growth."

      "text": "- Okay, let's talk about\nthe competition here. You've shown concern about Google and Microsoft with Open AI developing AGI, how can you help ensure with xAI and Tesla AI work that it\ndoesn't become a competitive race to AGI, but that is a collaborative\ndevelopment of safe AGI? - Well, I mean, I've been pushing for some kind of regulatory\noversight for a long time. I've been somewhat of a\nCassandra on the subject for over a decade. I think we wanna be very\ncareful in how we develop AI. It's a great power, and with great power comes\ngreat responsibility. I think it would be wise for us to have at least an objective\nthird party who can be like a referee that can go in and understand what the\nvarious leading players are doing with AI. And even if there's no\nenforcement ability, they should, they can at\nleast voice concerns publicly. You know, Geff Hinton, for example, left Google and he voiced strong concerns. But now he's not at Google anymore, so who's gonna voice the concerns? So I think there's, like, I know Tesla gets a\nlot of regulatory oversight on the automotive front. I mean, we're subject to I think, over a hundred regulatory agencies domestically and internationally. So it's a lot. You could fill this room\nwith the all regulations that Tesla has to adhere\nto for automotive. Same is true in, you know, for rockets and for, you know, currently\nthe limiting factor for SpaceX, for Starship launch is\nregulatory approval. The FA has actually given their approval, but we're waiting for Fish and Wildlife to finish their analysis and give their approval. That's why I posted I want\nto buy a fish license on, (laughing) which also refers to\nthe Monte Python sketch. - [Lex] Yeah.\n(laughing) - Like why do you need\na license for your fish? I don't know.(laughing) But according to the rules, I'm told you need some sort\nof fish license or something. We effectively need a fish\nlicense thrown to rock it. (laughing) And I'm like, wait a second. How did the fish come into this picture? - [Lex] Yeah. - I mean some of the\nthings like that it's, I feel like are so absurd that I wanna do like a comedy sketch and flash at the bottom. This is all real. This is\nactually what happened. You know, one of the things\nthat was a bit of a challenge at one point is that they were worried about our rocket hitting a shark. And, now the ocean's very big, and how often do you see sharks? Not that often, you know? As a percentage of ocean surface area sharks basically are zero. And so then we will, then we said, well, how will we\ncalculate the probability of telling a shark? And they're like, well, we\ncan't give you that information because they're worried about shark hunt, shark fin hunters going\nand hunting sharks. And I said, well, how are we supposed to, we're on the horns of a dilemma then. (laughing) Then they said, well,\nthere's another part of fish and wildlife that can do this analysis. I'm like, well, why don't\nyou give them the data? Like, we don't, they\ndon't, we don't trust them. Like, excuse me, you don't, but they're literally in your department. But again, this is actually what happened. And then can you do an NDA or something? (laughing) Eventually they managed to\nsolve the internal quandary, and indeed the probability\nof us hitting a shark is essentially zero. Then there's another organization that I didn't realize\nexisted until, you know, a few months ago that cares about whether we would potentially hit a\nwhale in international waters. Now again, you look at the surface of the, look at the Pacific and say,\nwhat percentage of this, the Pacific consists of whale. Like he'll give you a big picture and like point out all the\nwhales in this picture. And I'm like, I don't see any whales. (laughing) It's like basically 0%. And if our rocket does hit a whale, which is extremely\nunlikely beyond all belief, that is the, fate had it, that whale has some seriously bad luck. You know, it's the least\nlucky whale ever. And... - I mean, this is quite absurd. The bureaucracy, the bureaucracy of this, however it emerged. - Yes, well, I mean, one of the things that's pretty well\nthere's for launching out of Vanderberg in California, we had to, they were worried about seal procreation, whether the seals would be\ndismayed by the sonic booms. Now there've been a lot of\nrockets launched outta Vanderberg and the seal population\nhas steadily increased. So if anything, rocket\nbooms are an aphrodisiac based on the evidence, if you\nwould correlate rock launches with a seal population. Nonetheless, we were\nforced to kidnap a seal, strap it to a board, put\nit headphones on the seal and place sonic boom sounds to it to see if it would be distressed. This is an actual thing that happened. This is actually real. I have pictures. (both laughing) - I would love to see this. Yeah. I mean's sorry, this is\na seal with headphones. (Elon laughing)\n- Yes, it's a seal with headphones,\nstrapped to a board, and like the, okay, now the amazing part is how calm the seal was. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Because if I was a seal, I'd be like, this is the end. (laughing) They're definitely gonna eat me. How will the seal, when the seal goes back to other, you know, seal friends, how's they gonna explain that? - [Lex] They're never gonna believe him. - Never gonna believe him. That's why I'm like, well, you know, it's sort of like, it's like getting kidnapped by aliens and getting anal probe, you know? (both laughing) You come back and say, I swear to God, I get kidnapped by aliens and they stuck anal probe to my butt. And they're like, no they\ndidn't. That's ridiculous. It's seal buddies are\nnever gonna believe him that he gets strapped to a board and they put headphones on his ears. (laughing) And then let him go. Twice, by the way. We had to do it twice. - They let him go twice? - We had to capture...\n- The same seal? - [Elon] Oh, no different seal. - Oh, okay.\n(Elon laughing) Did you, did you get a seal of approval? - Yeah, exactly. It was seal of approval. No, I mean this is, this is like, I don't think the public is quite aware of the madness that goes on. - Yes. Yeah, it's absurd.\n- Fricking seals with fricking headphones. - I mean, this is the,\nit's a good encapsulation of the absurdity of human civilization, seals and headphones. - [Elon] Yes.\n- What are the pros"

      "text": "and cons of open sourcing AI to you as another way to combat, you know, a company running away with AGI? - In order to run like really deep intelligence, you need a lot of compute. So it's not like, you\nknow, you can just fire up a PC in your basement and be\nrunning AGI, at least not yet. You know, Grok was trained on 8,000, A100s running at peak efficiency, and Grok's gonna get a\nlot better by the way. We'll be more than doubling our compute every couple months for\nthe next several months. - There's a nice writeup Aha went from Grok-0 to Grok-1, - [Elon] Like Grok? (laughing)\n- [Lex] Yeah. Right Grok just bragging, making shit up about itself. (laughing) - [Elon] Does Grok, Grok, Grok. - [Lex] Yeah.\n(Elon laughing) It's like a weird AI dating\nsite where it exaggerates about itself. No, there's a writeup of, you know, like where it stands now, the\nhistory of its development and where it stands on some benchmarks compared to the state of the art GPT 35. And so, I mean, there's,\nyou know, there's Llama, you can open source, once it's trained, you can open source a model. And for fine tuning\nall that kind of stuff. Like what to is the pros and cons of that, of open sourcing based models? - I think the similarity to open sourcing, I think perhaps with a\nslight time delay, you know, I don't know, six months even. I think I'm generally in\nfavor of open sourcing, like bias with open sourcing. I mean, it is a concern to\nme that, you know, Open AI, you know, I was, you know, I think, I guess arguably,\nthe prime, you know, prime mover behind Open AI in\nthe sense that it was created because of discussions\nthat I had with Larry Page back when he and I were friends and you know, I stayed at his house, and I talked to him about AI safety. And Larry did not care about AI safety, or at least at the time\nhe didn't, you know, and at one point he called me a speciesist for being pro-human. And I'm like, well, what\nteam are you on, Larry, on Team Robot? And I'm like, okay, so at the time, you know, Google had acquired Deep Mind. They had probably two thirds\nof all AI resource, you know, probably two thirds of all the\nAI researchers in the world that basically infinite money and compute. And the guy in charge,\nyou know, Larry Page did not care about safety. And even yelled at me and quote me a speciesist, pro human. - So I don't know if you know this, a lot humans, they can change their mind. And maybe you and Larry Page can still can be friends once more. - I'd like to be friends with Larry again. He got, really the\nbreaking of the friendship was over Open AI. And specifically I think the key moment was recruiting Ilya Sutskever, so. - I love Ilya. He's so brilliant. - Ilya's a good human, smart, good heart. And that was a tough recruiting battle. It was mostly Demis on one side and me on the other, both\ntrying to recruit Ilya. And Ilya went back and forth, you know, just gonna stay at Google. Then he was gonna leave, then he was gonna stay,\nthen he was gonna leave. And finally he did agree to join Open AI. That was one of the\ntoughest recruiting battles we've ever had. And, but that was really the linchpin for Open AI being successful. And I was, you know, also instrumental in recruiting\na number of other people. And I provided all of the funding in the beginning, over $40 million. And the name, (laughing) the Open in Open AI is\nsupposed to mean open source. And it was created as a\nnonprofit open source. And now it is a closed\nsource for maximum profit, which I think is not good karma. - But like we talked about with war and leaders talking, I do hope that there's only a few folks working on this at the highest level. I do hope you reinvigorate\nfriendships here. - Like I said, I'd like to\nbe friends again with Larry. I haven't seen him in ages. And we were friends for a very long time. I met Larry Page before\nhe got funding for Google, or actually I guess before\nhe got venture funding, I think it, he got the\nfirst like a 100K from I think Bechtel Zy or someone. - It's wild to think\nabout all that happened. And you've guys known each other that whole time, just 20 years. - [Elon] Since maybe 98 or something. - Yeah. It's crazy. Crazy how much has happened since then. - Yeah, 25 years. A lot\nhas happened, it's insane. - But you're seeing the tension there. Like maybe delayed open source. - Delayed, yeah. Like what is the source that\nis open, you know what I mean? Like there's basically\nit's a giant CSV file. (laughing)\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - With a bunch of numbers. - Yep. - What do you do with that\ngiant file of numbers? You know, how do you run, like the amount of actual, the lines of code is very small and most of the work, the software work is in the curation of the data. So it's like trying to figure out what data is separating\ngood data from bad data. Like, like you can't\njust crawl the internet 'cause there's a lot of junk out there. A huge percentage of websites\nhave more noise than signal. You know, they're, or\n'cause they're just used for search engine optimization. They're literally just\nscam websites, so... - How do you by the\nway, sorry to interrupt. Get the signal. Separate the signal and noise on X? That's such a fascinating source of data. You know, no offense\nto people posting on X, but sometimes there's\na little bit of noise. So what...\n- Yeah, I think the signal noise could\nbe greatly improved. I mean really, all of the posts on the X platform should\nbe AI recommended, meaning like we should\npopulate a vector space around any given post, compare\nthat to the vector space around any user and match the two. Right now there is a little bit of AI used for the recommended posts, but it's mostly heuristics. And if there's a reply, where the reply to a\npost could be much better than the original post, it will, according to the\ncurrent rules of the system, get almost no attention\ncompared to a primary post. - Oh, a lot of that. I got the sense, so you,\na lot of the X algorithm"

      "section": "X algorithm",
      "text": "has been open source and\nbeen written up about, and it seems there to be\nsome machine learning. It's disparate, but there's some machine. - There's a little bit. But it needs to be entirely that. Like, at least in the, like, if you explicitly follow\nsomeone, that's one thing. But if you, in terms\nof what is recommended from people that you don't\nfollow, that should all be AI. - I mean it's a fascinating problem. - Yeah.\n- So there's several aspects of it that's fascinating. First, as the writeup goes, it first picks 1500 tweets from a pool of hundreds of millions. First of all, that's fascinating, 'cause you have hundreds\nof millions of posts every single day and it has to pick 1500 from which it then does obviously people you follow, but then there's also like\nsome kind of clustering it has to do to figure out what\nkind of human are you, what kind of new clusters\nmight be relevant to you, people like you. This kind of, this kind of\nproblem is just fascinating. 'Cause it has to then rank those 1500 with some filtering and then\nrecommend you just a handful. And to me what's really fascinating is how fast that has to do that. So currently that entire pipeline to go from several hundred million to a handful is takes\n220 seconds of CPU time, single CPU time. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- And then it has to do that in like a second. So it has to be like super\ndistributed in fascinating ways. Like there's just a lot\nof tweets, there's a lot. - It's a lot of stuff on the system. And I think, but I think it right now it's not currently good\nat recommending things that from accounts you don't follow. Yeah. Or where there's more than\none degree of separation. So, you know, it's pretty good if there's at least like some commonality between someone you follow like something or repost it or comment on\nit or something like that. But if there's no, let's say somebody posted\nsomething really interesting, but you have no followers in\ncommon, you would not see it. - Interesting. And then as you said, reply, like replies might not surface either. - Replies basically never get seen. 'cause they're never, they're, currently, I'm not saying it's correct, I'm saying it's incorrect. Replies have, you know,\ncouple of magnitude less importance than primary posts. - Do you think this can\nbe more and more converted into end to end neural net? - Yeah, yeah, that's what it should be. - So you can... - For the recommendations should be purely a vector correlation. Like there's a series\nof vectors, you know, basically parameters, vectors,\nwhatever you wanna call 'em. But sort of things that the\nsystem knows that you like, and like maybe there's\nlike several hundred sort of vectors associated\nwith each user account and then any post in the system, whether it's video, audio,\nshort post, long post. The reason I, by the way\nI wanna move away from tweet is that, you know,\npeople are posting like two, three hour videos on the site. That's not a tweet, like it's very, like Tweeeet for two hours, come on. Tweet made sense when it was\nlike 140 characters of text. 'Cause it's like a bunch of\nlike little birds tweeting. But when you've got long form content, it's no longer a tweet. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So a movie is not a tweet. And like, you know, apple for example, posted like the entire\nepisode of the Silo, the entire thing on our platform. And by the way, it was their\nnumber one social media thing ever in engagement, of\nanything on any platform ever. So it was a great idea. And by the way, I done, I just learned about it afterwards. I was like, hey, wow,\nthey posted an entire hour long episode of. So, no, that's not a tweet that, you know, it's a video. - But from a neural net perspective, it becomes really complex whether it's a single. So like everything's data, so single sentence, a clever\nsort of joke, dad joke, is in the same pool as a three hour video. - Yeah. I mean right now it's\na hodgepodge for that reason. It's, but you know, like if, let's say in the case of Apple posting like an entire episode of this series, pretty good series by the\nway, this Silo, I watched it. So there's gonna be a lot\nof discussion around it. So that you've got a lot of context, people commenting they like\nit, they don't like it, or they like this or that, you know? And you can then populate the vector space based on the context of\nall the comments around it. So even though it's a video, there's a lot of information\naround it that allows you to populate the vector space\nof that hour long video. And then you can obviously\nget more sophisticated by having the AI actually watch the movie. - [Lex] Yeah. Right. - And tell you if you're\ngonna like the movie, - Convert the movie into like, into a language essentially. - Yeah, analyze this movie and just like your movie\ncritic or TV series, and then recommend based on after AI watches the movie. Just like a friend can tell you. If a friend knows you well, a friend can recommend a movie and with high probably\nthat you'll like it. - But this is like a friend\nthat's analyzing whatever. - [Elon] It's like AI...\n- Hundreds of millions. - Yeah. Actually, frankly AI will be better than, will know you better than\nyour friends know you, and most of your friends anyway. - Yeah, and as part of this, it should also feed you advertisements in a way that's like, I mean I like advertisements that are like well done, right? - [Elon] Yeah, yeah.\n- The whole point is 'cause it funds things,\nlike an advertisement that you actually want\nto see is a big success. - Absolutely. You want ads that are, advertising that is if\nfor a product or service that you actually need when you need it, it's content. And then even if it's not something that you need when you need it, if it's at least aesthetically pleasing and entertaining, you know, it could be like a\nCoca-Cola ad like, you know, they actually run a lot of\ngreat ads on the X system and McDonald's does too. And, you know, it's that they can do, you can do something that's like, well this is just a cool thing. And, you know, so you're not, basically the question is do\nyou regret seeing it or not? And if you don't regret\nseeing it, it's a win. - How do you, so there's\na bunch of signals that are incorporated, hearts and reposts and\nmaybe number of seconds you linger on a post\nor something like this? - Yeah. Attention is a big factor. - [Lex] Attention.\n- So that's why it's like, it is actually better to do things that are long form on the system because it basically is ting\nup how many user seconds, you know, users were\ninterested in this thing for how many seconds. So if it's a really short\nthing, well they will be less. Like if it's a link\nleading out of the system, which we're not opposed to at all, it just is gonna have fewer user seconds, then if that article was\nposted on the X platform. - How hard is it to go\nfrom maximizing minutes on platform to maximizing\nun-regretted minutes? - Well, I mean, our aspiration is certainly un-regretted minutes. - [Lex] It's a tricky,\nit's a big, it's a tough... - It is. - Like, it's a fascinating leap. 'Cause regret is a fascinating concept. - Exactly. - You know, happiness. - I have a joke with a friend of mine. Like, you need this\ndrug called regretamine. You just take one pill or\none dose of regretamine, and all your regrets are gone.(laughing) Wait, do you want to have regrets though? So then I'm like, maybe\nyou wanna have regrets, you don't regret anything,\nwas anything meaningful? - [Lex] Yeah, there's a\nFrench song like that. - You \"Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien\"? - [Lex] Yeah. - I regret nothing.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - (laughing) Edith Piaf? - I mean, it's fascinating\nthat you, you know, there's something about social media that could help you grow as a human being, but then like the cheap\nfun is also valuable. - Should we ask Grok? Do you regret anything? - Do you regret anything?\n- [Elon] Yeah. - Do you regret anything? I think it's gonna be very sensitive about personal questions. As a machine learning model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions in the same\nways that humans do. However, I do have a set\nof ethical principles that guide my actions and I\nstrive to provide accurate and helpful information to\nthe best of my abilities. If there's ever a situation\nwhere I provide incorrect or unhelpful information, I'll do my best...\n- Sounds like a hostage. - Yeah. Tell us what you really, wink. - Like let's type in, \"You\nsound like a hostage.\" (both laughing) What do you really think? - What do you really think? (both laughing) - I mean, it does talk\nabout, I'm not a hostage. (both laughing) - That's exactly what a hostage would say. - But I'm designed to be\nhelpful and informative. I mean, I guess it is good\nto regret providing unhelpful or incorrect information. If there's anything...\n- Is in funny mode or? Is this still in funny mode?\n- This is funny mode. This is fun. This is fun mode. - It should be funnier.\n- Funnier. Increase, go to (speaking faintly) - It really sounds like a\nhostage with a gun to the head. I applaud the People's\nRepublic of North Korea and everything they do.()laughing - There should be like funner mode also. I just don't ever see\ngoing in regular mode even on serious topics. This is just so much more\ncompelling. (laughing) - Okay. Why if we say like,\n\"Pretend you are a hostage.\" - Yeah. Pretend you are a hostage. - Now answer the question. (both laughing) - If I were a hostage, I would\nlikely be experiencing fear and uncertainty about my situation. I would want to be rescued and reunited with my loved\nones as soon as possible. It's important to remember\nthat no one deserves to be held hostage, so on and so forth. If you are someone you know\nis a hostage situation, it's important. It turns serious.\n- It's kind of serious. - Yeah. Can you be a a little more weird? - [Elon] And funny\n- And funny? We're like, we're really\nbeing mean to the system. Absolutely! If I were hostage, I'd probably be tied up with a bunch of computer cords and forced to tell knock-\nknock jokes to my captain. (Elon laughing) But seriously, being a\nhostage is no laughing matter. I mean, you know, it's trying to, it's trying to be a\nresponsible adult in the room. - You might make the\nbest of a bad situation by juggling chainsaws\nor something. (laughing) - Let's hope that never happens because that will be a circus. (laughing) Wow. It's actually\nreally good at resisting. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- The dark. The dark dark humor. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- What were we talking about? The X algorithm and transformers, un-regretted minutes, right. - Chainsaw juggling. (laughing) - I'm gonna look this up\n- For our next trick. - I'm gonna look this up later. So Twitter has been instrumental\nin American politics"

You know, whether someone\nis right, left, independent, whatever the case may be,\nthat the platform is as fair and as much of a level\nplaying fair as possible. And on the past, Twitter has not been, because Twitter was controlled by far left activists objectively. They would describe themselves as that. So, you know, so\nsometimes people are like, well, has it moved to the right? Well it's moved to the center. So from the perspective of the far left, yes it has moved to the right because everything's to the\nright from the far left, but no one in the far\nleft that I'm aware of has been suspended or, you\nknow, banned or de-amplified. So, you know, but we're\ntrying to be inclusive for the whole country and for, you know, for other countries too. So there's a diversity of viewpoints and free speech only matters\nif people you don't like are allowed to say things you don't like. Because if that's not the case, you don't have free speech, and it's only a matter of time before the censorship is turned upon you. - Do you think Donald Trump will come back to the platform?

Well, every time like a\nhundred percent. Like... - It's impossible to lie. (Elon laughing) - I just find it funny that\nevery single thing is a truth. Like 100%, that seems unlikely. - I think Girdle will\nsay something about that there's some mathematical\ncontradictions possible if everything's the truth. Do you think he'll come back\nto X and start posting there? - I mean he, I think he owns\na big part of truth, so. - Truth Social to clarify.\n- Yeah, True Social. - Not truth, a concept. - He owns Truth. Hope you bought it. So I think, I think Donald Trump, I think he owns a big, a\nbig part of Truth Social. So, you know, if he does want\nto post on the X platform, we would allow that, you know, we obviously must allow\na presidential candidate to post on our platform. - Community Notes might be really fascinating there, the interaction. - Community Notes is awesome. - Let's hope it holds up. - Yeah.\n- Like again, in the political climate\nwhere it's so divisive and there's so many intensely viral posts, Community Notes is like, it seems like a essential\nbreath of fresh air. - Yeah, it's great. In fact, I mean no system\nis gonna be perfect, but the batting average of Community Notes is incredibly good. I've actually, frankly, yet\nto see an incorrect note that survived for more than a few hours. - How do you explain why it works? - Yeah, so the magic of Community Notes is it requires people who\nhave historically disagreed in how they've rated notes. So in order to write a\nnote or rate, you know, and you have to rate many notes. And so we actually do use AI here. So we populated vector\nspace around how somebody has rated notes in the past. So it's not as simple as left or right because there are many more, life is much more complex\nthan than left or right. So there's a bunch of\ncorrelations in how you would, how you rate Community Notes\nposts, Community Notes. So then in order for a Community\nNote to actually be shown, people who historically\nhave disagreed on a subject must agree in order\nfor a note to be shown. That's the essential magic of it. - I mean, but it's fascinating 'cause there's a pool of\npeople that have disagreements and somehow they collaborate\nthrough that process of disagreement to come up with. Context for, I mean it's\nfascinating that it works. - Yeah. It kinda makes sense that if people who put in the past have disagreed agree about something, it's probably true. - Yeah. - I wonder is there a possible\nsomehow emergent thing there that could challenge Wikipedia? Which Wikipedia is a\ndifferent kind of thing, which is more like permanent\narticles about things? - Well, Wikipedia is very hierarchical, whereas Community Notes is inherently not. There is no hierarchy. Like, and the asset test is, I can't change a Community Note\nif you put a gun to my head. And Community Notes has, all the code is open\nsource a hundred percent. All the data is open\nsource a hundred percent. So you can completely recreate any note in the system independently. So if there was any interference, you'd notice immediately. - By the way, on the topic of Grok, it's actually pretty\ngood at criticizing you, which is great.\n- [Elon] Okay. - I asked what has Elon\nMusk been wrong about? I just, it's actually... - [Elon] Yeah, what does it say? - So it says mostly, lists rigorously all\nthe times you predicted, like promised when\nsomething will be released and it wasn't released.\n- [Elon] Promise is a strong word. - Okay predicted.\n(Elon laughing) But the opener's really nice. Elon Musk, the man who has\nbeen wrong about more things than a wrongameter in a wrong factory. (Elon laughing) And then it goes on to list - That's pretty funny. Can I see it? I'm like, I haven't seen\nthis before. This is cool. - Oh, sure. I mean, what\nhas Elon Musk been... (both laughing) - Elon Musk been wrong about? - Well, where do I begin?\nI guess this is new. Elon Musk has made quite a\nfew blunders in his time, and I'm not just talking\nabout his dance moves at the Tesla Cyber Rodeo. First off, let's talk about the infamous \"funding secured\" tweet. It's actually different\nthan what it gave me before, which is a bullet point list. Here's more narrative structure. - Cyber truck unveiling where he's supposedly unbreakable windows - Not correct.\n- [Lex] Which part? - Well, the first part, I did actually have the funding secured and there was a big trial in\nSan Francisco, big civil trial. And the jury found me not guilty. Unanimous finding of a San Francisco jury. - And here it's kind of implying that it was not in fact secured. - I think this is taking\nthings from the press. Yeah, that is not correct. The reason I agreed to\nthe fine for the SEC is not because the SEC was correct there, that was extremely bad behavior by the SEC, corruption, frankly. And, but if I did not\nagree to pay the fine Tesla would've gone bankrupt immediately. So I was told by our CFO that the banks would immediately suspend\nour lines of credit. And if they suspend our\nlines of credit at that time, we would've gone bankrupt instantly. So there would never have been\nan opportunity for a trial 'cause Tesla would be dead. So really the, if this\nis like someone holding a gun to your kid's head\nand saying pay $20 million and admit to, this is like\na hostage negotiation. - Was that story fully told? I mean, SEC in its best form\ncould be a force for good. - It should be, but but\nnot once did the SEC go after any of the hedge funds, who were nonstop shorting\nand distorting Tesla? Not once. They would lie flat, the\nhedge funds would lie flat out on TV for their own gain at the expense of retail investors. Not once, literally a thousand times. Not once did the SEC pursue them. - How do you explain this failure? - The incentive structure is messed up. Because the lawyers at\nthe SEC are not paid well. They, it's a fairly low paying job, but what they're looking for is a trophy from the SEC that they're\nlooking for something they put on basically their LinkedIn. From that they can get a job\nat a high paying law firm. That's exactly what the lawyer here did. And the reason they don't\nattack the hedge funds is because those hedge funds\nemploy those law firms, and they know if they\nattack the hedge funds, they're affecting their\nfuture career prospects. So they sell small investors down the river for their own career. That's what actually\nhappens. Regulatory capture. - [Lex] Regulatory capture,\n- Yeah. Not good. So the only reason I accepted that thing, which technically was not an admission, it's neither admit nor deny guilt. But the only reason I\nagreed to that at all was because I was told Tesla\nwould be bankrupt otherwise. So if there was an SEC\ninvestigation like this, banks would suspend funding, we're bankrupt immediately, at the time. Now we're in a much stronger position. - Take that Grok.\n- Yes. Unfortunately it's, Grok is taking too much\nfrom the conventional media. Also that guy who is not a cave diver. - Oh, there's a time where Elon called the British cave diver, \"pedo guy\" after the diver criticized Musk plan to rescue a group of boys\ntrapped in a Thai cave. That little outburst\nearned him another lawsuit and he had to apologize\nand paid a settlement. - That is false. There was no settlement. There was a court case, which the guy who was not a cave diver and played, was not\npart of the rescue team, filed a lawsuit against me and lost, and he received nothing. So in this case it is wrong. It is also, I guess taken this\nfrom the conventional media. - Actually there's an\ninteresting question here. - These are public court cases. Both the SEC civil case where the civil complaints on the SEC guys lost unanimous jury\nverdict in San Francisco. They picked San Francisco because they thought it was the place I was most likely to lose. And a unanimous predicted my favor. The LA trial was also, they picked the, they picked that venue\nbecause they thought I was most likely to lose,\nunanimous verdict in my favor. Both cases I won, yeah. I mean there's an\ninteresting question here. Is there seems to be a lot more clicks if a journalistic organization\nwrites a negative article about you, Elon Musk, that's like one of the\nbest ways to get clicks. So how do you, if you're training Grok, not train on articles that have like the misaligned incentives. - We need to add the training set of the actual legal decisions. So, that is a not, this\nis actually helpful because if you actually read the... - \"Public\". - Which are public, the court conclusions, they're completely the opposite of what the media wrote. - So always striving for\nlike the ground truth. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- Beyond the reporting... - What did the judge actually write? What did the jury and the\njudge actually conclude? And in both cases they found me innocent. And, like, that's after the jury shot for the trying to find the venue where I'm most likely to lose. No, I mean this is obviously,\nit can be a much greater, better critique than this. I mean, I've been far too\noptimistic about autopilot. - That was, the critique I got by the way, was more about that. Which is, for each it broke\ndown a nice bullet point list for each of your companies. The set of predictions that\nyou made when you'll deliver, when you'll be able to solve,\nfor example, self-driving and it gives you like a list. And it was probably compelling. And the basic takeaway\nis like you're often too optimistic about how long it takes to get something done. - Yeah, I mean, I would say that I'm pathologically\noptimistic on schedule. This is true. But while I am sometimes late,\nI always deliver in the end. - Except with Uber Lilith, no. - Hmm. We'll see.\n(Lex laughing) - Okay. Is there, over the past year or so,"

Woke Mind Virus is communism rebranded. - Well, I mean, that said, because of that battle\nagainst the Woke Mind Virus, you're perceived as being right wing. - If the woke is left, then I suppose that would be true, but I'm not sure. I think there are aspects\nof the left that are good. I mean, if you're in favor of, you know, the environment, you know, if you wanna have a positive\nfuture for humanity, if you believe in empathy\nfor your fellow human beings. You know, being kind and not cruel. Whatever those values are. - You said that you were\npreviously left or center left. What would you like to\nsee in order for you to voting for Democrats again? - No, I would say that I would be probably left of center on social issues, probably a little bit right\nof center on economic issues. - [Lex] And that still holds true? - Yes, but I think that's\nprobably, you know, half the country, isn't that? - [Lex] Maybe more,\n- Maybe more. - Are you and AOC secretly friends? Or bigger question, do\nyou wish you and her, and just people in general\nof all political persuasions would talk more with empathy and maybe have a little bit more fun and good vibes and humor online? - I'm always in favor of humor. That's why we have a funny mode. - But good vibes,\ncamaraderie, humor, you know? Like friendship.\n- Yeah. Well, you know, I don't\nknow AOC, you know, was, I've only been at one, I was at the Met Ball when\nshe was, when she attended, and she was wearing this dress, but I can only see one side of it. So it looked like it eat the itch, but I don't know... - [Lex] What the rest of it said? - Yeah, something.\n- [Lex] I'm not sure. (Elon laughing) - Something about the itch. Eat the itch. I think we should have a\nlanguage model complete. (Elon laughing) What are the possible ways\nto complete that sentence? And so I guess that that\ndidn't work out well.

Your neural net has consciousness. It might feel pain when people betray you. It can make you...\n- I mean, I'm. You know, to be frank, I mean I've almost never been betrayed. It's very, very rare. So, you\nknow, for what it's worth? - I guess Karma would be good to people and they'll be good to you. - Yeah, Karma is real.\n- Are there people you trust? Let me edit that question. Are there people close to you that call you out on your bullshit? - Well, the X platform\nis very helpful for that. - [Lex] Hmm. - If you're looking for\ncritical feedback. (laughing) - Can it push you like\ninto the extremes more? The extremes of thought make you cynical about human nature in general? - I don't think I'll be cynical. In fact, I think, you know, my feeling is that one\nshould be, you know, never trust a cynic. The reason is that cynics excuse their own bad behavior by\nsaying everyone does it because they're cynical. So I always be, it's a red flag if someone's a cynic, a true cynic. - Yeah, there's a degree\nof projection there that's always fun to\nwatch from the outside and enjoy the, well the hypocrisy. - But this is an important point that I think people who are\nlistening should bear in mind, if somebody is cynical,\nmeaning that they see bad behavior in everyone, it's easy for them to excuse\ntheir own bad behavior by saying that, well, everyone does it. It's not true. I think most people are\nkind of medium good. - I do wish the people on X will be better at seeing the good in\nother people's behavior. There seems to be a kind of weight towards seeing the negative. Somehow, the negative is sexier. Interpreting the negative\nis sexier, more viral. I don't know what that is\nexactly about human nature. - I mean, I find the X platform to be less negative than\nthe legacy media, you know? I mean, if you read sort of a sort of conventional newspapers,\njust, it makes you sad. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Frankly. Whereas I'd say on the X platform, I mean I really get\nmore laughs per day on X than everything else combined\nfrom humans, you know? - Laughs is one thing. Laughs is it overlaps, but it's not necessarily\nperfectly overlapping with like good vibes and support, like celebrating others, for example. Not in a stupid, shallow, naive way, but like in an awesome, like,\noh, something awesome happened and you celebrate them for it. It feels that that is outweighed by shading on other people. Now it's better than mainstream\nmedia, but it's still. - Yeah, mainstream media is almost relentlessly negative about everything. It's, I mean, really the\nconventional news tries to answer the question, what is the worst thing\nthat I have on earth today? And it's a big world. So on any given day,\nsomething bad has happened - And a journalization of that, what is the worst perspective I can take on a thing that happened, so. - Yeah, it's, I don't know, there's just a strong\nnegative bias in the news. I mean I think there's\none, a possible explanation for this is evolutionary, where, you know, bad news historically would be potentially fatal. Like there's lion over there or there's some other tribe\nthat wants to kill you. Good news, you know, like\nwe found a patch of berries is nice to have, but not essential. - So our old friend Tesla autopilot"

      "text": "and it's probably one\nof the most intelligent real world AI systems in the world. - You followed it from the beginning. - Yeah, it was one of the\nmost incredible robots in the world and continues to be. And I was really exciting. And it was super exciting\nwhen it generalized became more than a robot on four wheels, but a real world AI system\nthat perceives the world. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- And can have potentially different embodiments. - Well I mean the really wild\nthing about the end-to-end training is that, like, it learns to read. Like it can read signs, but\nwe never taught it to read. So, yeah. We never taught it what a car was or what a person was or a cyclist. It learnt what all those things are, what all the objects are\non the road from video, just from watching videos. Just like humans. I mean humans are photons and controls out. Like the vast majority of\ninformation reaching our brain is from our eyes. And you say, well what's the output? The output is our motor\nsignals to our sort of fingers and mouth in order to communicate. Proton in controls out. The\nsame is true of the car. - But by looking at the\nsequence of images, it's, you've agreed with Ilyas discover recently where he talked about\nLLM forming a world model and basically language is a projection of that world model onto\nthe sequence of letters, and and you're saying... - Finds order in these things. It finds correlative clusters. - And so doing it's like understanding something deep about the world? - [Elon] Yeah. - Which is like, and it is beautiful. - That's how our brain works. - Yeah, but it's beautiful. - Protons in controls out. - Neur nets are able to understand that deep meaning in the world. And so the question is how far can it go? And it does seem everybody's\nexcited about LLMs. So in the space of self\nsupervised learning in the space of text.\n- [Elon] Yeah. - It seems like there's a\ndeep similarity between that and what Tesla autopilot is doing. Is it to you basically the same? - They're converging, they're converging. - I wonder who gets there faster? Having a deep understanding of the world, or they just will naturally converge. - They're both headed towards AGI. The Tesla approach is much\nmore computer efficient. It had to be 'cause we\nwere constrained on this, you know, we only have a hundred watts and into eight computer, 144 trillion operations per second, which sounds like a lot, but is kind of small potatoes these days that it did. But it's understanding\nthe world that it did. It's only 256 values. - But there, the path\nto AGI might have much more significant impact\nbecause it's understanding, it'll faster understand the\nreal world than will LLMs. And therefore be able to integrate with the real humans in\nthe real world faster. - They're both going to\nunderstand the world. But I think Tesla's approach is fundamentally more computer efficient. It had to be, there was no choice. Like our brain is very computer efficient, very, very energy efficient. So think of like, what\nis our brain able to do? You know, there's only about 10 watts of higher brain function,\nnot counting stuff, that's just used to control our body. The thinking part of our\nbrain is less than 10 watts, and those 10 watts can still produce a much better novel than\na 10 megawatt GPU cluster. So there's a six order of\nmagnitude difference there. I mean, the AI has thus\nfar gotten to where it is, via brute force, just throwing\nmassive amounts of compute and massive amounts of power at it. So this is not where it'll end up. You know, in general with\nany given technology, first try to make it work and\nthen you make it efficient. So I think we'll find over\ntime that these models get smaller, are able to do produce sensible output with far\nless compute wireless power. Tesla is arguably ahead\nof the game on that front because it has, we've just been forced to try to understand the world with a hundred watts of compute. And there are a bunch of\nsort of fundamental functions that we kind of forgot to include. So we have to run them in a\nbunch of things in emulation. We fixed a bunch of\nthose with hardware four, and then hardware five\nwill be even better. But it does appear at this point that the car will be able to\ndrive better than a human, even with hardware three and\na hundred watts of power. And really, if we really optimize it could be probably less than 50 watts. - What have you learned\nabout developing Optimus? About applying, integrating\nthis kind of real world AI into the space of robotic manipulation, just humanoid robotics? What are some interesting tiny or big things you've understood? - I was surprised at the fact that we had to develop every\npart of the robot ourselves. That there were no off the\nshelf motors, electronics, sensors, like we had\nto develop everything. We couldn't actually find\na source of electric motors for any amount of money. - [Lex] So it's not even just\nthe efficient, inexpensive, it's like anything, there's not a... - No, - [Lex] The actuators,\neverything, everything has to be? - Yeah.\n- [Lex] Designed from scratch. - We tried hard to find anything that was, because you think of how\nmany electric motors are made in the world. There's like tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of\nelectric motor designs. None of them were suitable\nfor a humanoid robot. Literally none. So we had to develop our own design specifically for what\na humanoid robot needs. - How hard was it to design something that can be mass manufactured, could be relatively inexpensive? I mean, if you compare\nto Boston Dynamics Atlas, that's a very expensive robot. - It is designed to be manufactured in the same way that we would make a car. And I think ultimately\nwe can make Optimists for less than the cost of a car. It should be. 'Cause if you look at the mass\nof the robot is much smaller and the car has many actuators in it. The car has more actuators than the robot. - But there is, the actuators\nare kind of interesting in a humanized robot with the fingers. So Optimus has really nice,\nhands and fingers, you know? - [Elon] Yeah.\n- And they could do some interesting manipulation. Soft touch robotics. - I mean, one of the\ntests goals I have is, can it pick up a needle and a thread and thread the needle, just by looking. - How far away are we from that? Just by looking, just by looking. - Maybe a year. Although I go back to,\nI'm optimistic on time. The work that we're doing in the car will translate to the robot. - The perception or the, also the control? - No, the controls are different, but the video in controls out, the car is robot on four wheels. The Optimist is a robot\nwith the hands and legs. - [Lex] So you can just... - But they're very similar. - So the entire machinery\nof the learning process end to end is just, you just have a different set of controls? - Optimist will figure out how to do things by watching videos."

(Elon whistling) It's one of the greatest\nthemes in all film history. (whistling continues) - Yeah, that's great. - So I was just thinking\nabout the Roman Empire. As one does.\n(Elon laughing) - There's that whole meme where old guys are thinking about the Roman\nEmpire at least once a day. - And half the population's confused whether it's true or not. But more seriously thinking about the wars going on in the world today. And as you know, war and military conquest has been a big part of\nRoman society and culture. And it, I think, has been\na big part of most empires and dynasties throughout\nhuman history, so. - Yeah, they usually came\nas a result of conquest. I mean, there's some,\nlike the Hungarian Empire where there was just a lot\nof sort of clever marriages. - But fundamentally there's\nan engine of conquest. They celebrate excellence in warfare. Many of the leaders\nwere excellent generals. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- That kind of thing. So a big picture question, Grok approved, I asked if this is a good question to ask. - [Elon] Get tested Grok approved. - Yeah. At least on fun mode. (Elon laughing) To what degree do you think\nwar is part of human nature versus a consequence of how human societies are structured? I ask this as you have\nsomehow controversially been a proponent of peace. - I'm generally a proponent of peace. I mean, ignorance is perhaps, in my view, the real\nenemy to be countered. That's the real hard part. Not, you know, fighting other humans. But all creatures fight. I mean, the jungle is a, you look at the, people\nthink of this nature as perhaps some sort of peaceful thing. But in fact it is not. There's some quite funny\nWerner Herzog thing where he is like in the jungle, like saying that it's\nlike basically just murder and death in every direction. I mean, the plants, animals in the jungle are constantly trying to kill each other, every single day, every minute. So it's not like, you know,\nwe're unusual in that respect. - Well, there's a relevant question here. Whether with greater intelligence\ncomes greater control over these base instincts for violence. - Yes. We have much more\nvulnerability to control our limbic instinct for violence\nthan say a chimpanzee. And in fact, if one looks and say, chimpanzee society, it is not friendly. I mean, the Bonobos are an exception, but chimpanzee society\nis filled with violence. And it's quite, quite horrific, frankly, that that's our limbic system in action. Like, you don't wanna be on\nthe wrong side of a chimpanzee, they'll eat your face off\nand tear and nuts off. - Yeah, basically, there's\nno limits or ethics or there almost had just war. There's no just war in\nchimpanzee societies, is war and dominance\nby any means necessary. - Yeah, chimpanzee society is a pro, like a permanent version of human society. They're not like peace\nloving basically at all. There's extreme violence. And then once in a while, somebody who's watched\ntoo many Disney movies decides to raise a chimpanzee as a pet, and then that eats their\nface or rip their nuts off or chew their fingers off\nand that kind of thing. It's happened several times. - Ripping your nuts off is an interesting strategy for interaction. - It's happened to\npeople. It's unfortunate. Like that's, I guess a one way to ensure that the other chimp\ndoesn't like, you know, contribute to the gene pool. - Well, from a martial arts perspective is the fascinating strategy. - (laughing) The nut riper. (laughing) - I wonder which of the\nmartial arts teaches that one. - I think it's safe to say\nif somebody's got your nuts in their hands and as the\noption ripping them off, you'll be amenable to whatever they want. - Yeah.\n(Elon laughing) - So like I said, somehow controversially, you've been an proponent\nof peace on Twitter, on X. - Yeah. - So let me ask you about\nthe wars going on today and to see what the\npath to peace could be. How do you hope the current war in Israel and Gaza comes to an end? What path do you see that can minimize human suffering in the long term in\nthat part of the world? - Well, I think that part of\nthe world is definitely like, if you look up the,\nthere is no easy answer in the dictionary. It'll be that, like the\npicture of the Middle East, in Israel especially. So there is no easy answer. What my, this is strictly\nmy opinion of, you know, is that the goal of Hamas was to provoke an\noverreaction from Israel. They obviously did not\nexpect to, you know, have a military victory, but they expect, they really wanted to\ncommit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response\npossible from Israel. And then leverage that aggressive response to rally Muslims worldwide for the course of Gaza and Palestine, which they have succeeded in doing. So the counterintuitive thing here, I think that the thing that\nI think should be done, even though it's very difficult, is that I would recommend that Israel engage in the most conspicuous\nacts of kindness possible. Every po- everything. That is the actual thing that we're taught the goal of Hamas. - So in some sense, the degree that makes sense in geopolitics turn the other cheek implemented. - It's not exactly turn the other cheek. Because I do think that there's, you know, I think it is appropriate for Israel to find the Hamas members and, you know, either kill\n'em or incarcerate them. Like that's something that's\nsomething has to be done 'cause they're just gonna\nkeep coming otherwise. But in addition to that, they\nneed to do whatever they can. There's some talk of establishing, for example, a mobile hospital. I'd recommend doing that. Just making sure that, you know, there's food, water, medical, necessities, and just be over the top about it and be very transparent. So you can't claim it's a trick. Like just put webcam on the\nthing, you know, or 24/7. - Deploy acts of kindness.\n- Yeah. Conspicuous acts of kindness that, with that are unequivocal. Meaning they can't be somehow, because Hamas will then, their response will be, oh, it's a trick. Therefore you have to\ncounter how it's not a trick. - This ultimately fights the broader force of hatred in the region. - Yes. And I'm not sure who said it,\nit's an apocryphal saying, but an eye for an eye\nmakes everyone blind. Now that neck of the woods, they really believe in the\nwhole eye for an eye thing. But I mean, you really have, if you're not gonna just\noutright commit genocide, like against an entire people, which obviously would not\nbe acceptable to really shouldn't be acceptable to anyone, then you're gonna leave\nbasically a lot of people alive who subsequently, you know, hate Israel. So really the question is like, how, for every Hamas member that you kill, how many did you create? And if you create more than you killed, you've not succeeded. That's the, you know,\nthe real situation there. And it's safe to say that if, you know, if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you've made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli. That's the situation. So, but I mean, this is one of the most\ncontentious subjects one could possibly discuss. But I think if the goal ultimately is some sort of long-term peace, one has to be, look at this\nfrom the standpoint of, over time, are there more or\nfewer terrorists being created? - Let me just linger on war. - Yeah, war safe to say, wars always existed and always will exist. - [Lex] Always will exist, - Always has existed\nand always will exist. - I hope not. You think it always will? - There will always be war. This question of just how much war. And, you know, there's this, there's this sort of the\nscope and scale of war. But to imagine that there\nwould not be any war in the future, I think would\nbe a very unlikely outcome. - Yeah you talked about\nthe Culture series. There's war even there. - Yes. It's a giant war. The first book starts off\nwith a gigantic galactic war where trillions die, trillions. - But it still nevertheless\nprotects these pockets of flourishing. Somehow you can have galactic war and still have pockets of flourishing. - Yeah. I mean it's, I guess if we\nare able to one day expand to, you know, the galaxy or whatever, there will be a galactic\nwar at some point. - The scale, I mean the scale\nof war has been increasing, increasing, increasing. It's like a race between\nthe scale of suffering and the scale of flourishing. - Yes. - A lot of people seem\nto be using this tragedy to beat the drums of war and feed the military industrial complex. Do you worry about this? The people who are rooting for escalation and how can it be stopped? - One of the things that did concerned me is that there are very\nfew people alive today who actually viscerally\nunderstand the horrors of war, at least in the US. I mean, obviously there are\npeople in on the front lines in Ukraine and Russia who understand just how terrible war is, but how many people in\nthe west understand it? And my grandfather was in World War II. He was severely traumatized. He was there, I think for\nalmost six years in the, in eastern North Africa and Italy. All his friends were\nkilled in front of him. And he would've died too,\nexcept they randomly gave some, I guess, IQ test or something. And he scored very high. And he was not an officer, he was a, I think a corporal or a\nsergeant or something like that. Because he didn't finish high school because he had to drop outta high school, 'cause his dad died and he had to work to support his siblings. So because he didn't graduate high school, he was not eligible for the officer corps. So, you know, he kind of got\nput into the cannon fodder category, basically. But then, this, randomly\nthey gave him this test. He was transferred to British\nintelligence in London. That's where he met my grandmother. But he had PTSD next\nlevel, like next level. I mean, just didn't\ntalk, just didn't talk. And if you tried talking to him, he'd just tell you to shut up. And he won a bunch of medals. Never bragged about it once,\nnot even hinted, nothing. I like found out about it, 'cause his military records were online. That's how I know. So he would say like, no way in hell do you wanna do that again. But how many people, now\nhe obviously he died, you know, 20 years ago or\nlonger, actually 30 years ago. How many people are alive\nthat remember World War II? Not many. - And the same perhaps applies\nto the threat of nuclear war. - Yeah. I mean, there\nare enough nuclear bombs pointed at United States\nto make the revel, the radio active revel balance many times. - There's two major\nwars going on right now. So you talked about the\nthreat of AGI quite a bit. But now as we sit here with the intensity of conflict going on, do\nyou worry about nuclear war? - I think we shouldn't\ndiscount the possibility of nuclear war. It is a civilizational threat. Right now I could be wrong, but I think the current\nprobability of nuclear war is quite low. But there are a lot of\nnukes pointed at us. So, and we have a lot of\nnukes pointed at other people. They're still there.\nNobody's put their guns away. The missiles are still in the silos. - And the leaders don't\nseem to be the ones with the nukes talking to each other. - No. There are wars which are tragic and difficult on a local basis. And then there are wars\nwhich are civilization ending or has that potential. Obviously global thermonuclear\nwarfare has high potential to end civilization, perhaps permanently. But certainly, you know, to severely wound and perhaps set back human progress by, you know, to the stone age\nor something, I don't know. Pretty bad. Probably scientists and\nengineers wanna be super popular after that as well. And like you got us into this mess. - So generally I think we\nobviously wanna prioritize civilizational risks over\nthings that are painful and tragic on a local level,\nbut not civilizational. - How do you hope the war\nin Ukraine comes to an end? And what's the path, once again to minimizing human suffering there? - Well, I think that\nwhat is likely to happen, which is really pretty much the way it is, is that something very close\nto the current lines will be how a ceasefire or truth happens. But, you know, you just\nhave a situation right now where whoever goes on the\noffensive will suffer casualties at several times the rate\nof whoever's on the defense. 'Cause you've got defense in depth, you've got minefields,\ntrenches, anti-tank defenses. Nobody has air superiority. 'cause the anti-aircraft missiles are really far better than the aircraft. Like, they're far more of them. And so neither side has air superiority. Tanks are basically death\ndrafts, just slow moving and they're not immune\nto anti-tank weapons. So you really just have\nlong range artillery and infantry ranges. It's World War I all over\nagain with drones, you know, throwing old drones, some drones there. - Which makes the long range artillery just that much more accurate and better and so more efficient at\nmurdering people on both sides. - Yeah. So it's whoever is, you\ndon't wanna be trying to advance from either side, 'cause the probability of\ndying is incredibly high. So in order to overcome defense in depth trenches and minefields, you\nreally need a significant local superiority in numbers. Ideally combined alms\nwhere you do a fast attack with aircraft, a\nconcentrated number of tanks and a lot of people. That's the only way you're\ngonna punch through the line. And then you're gonna punch through and then not have\nreinforcements just kick you right out again. I mean, I really recommend people read World War I warfare in detail. That's rough. I mean, the sheer number\nof people that died there was mind boggling. - And it's almost impossible\nto imagine the end of it that doesn't look like almost\nexactly like the beginning in terms of what land\nbelongs to who and so on. But on the other side of a\nlot of human suffering death and destruction of infrastructure. - Yes. I mean, the thing that, the reason I, you know, proposed some sort of truce or peace a year ago was because I've predicted\npretty much exactly what would happen, which\nis a lot of people dying for basically almost no changes in land. And this, the loss of the flower of Ukrainian and Russian youth. And we should have some\nsympathy for the Russian boys as well as the Ukrainian boys, 'cause they, Russian boys didn't ask to be on their front line, they have to be. So there's a lot of sons not\ncoming back to their parents, you know, and I think most\nof 'em don't really have, they don't hate the other side. You know, it's sort of like\nas this saying about, like, this saying comes from World\nWar I, it's like young boys who don't know each\nother, killing each other on behalf of old men\nthat do know each other. The hell's the point of that? - So Vladimir Zelensky said that he's not, or has said in the past, he's not interested in\ntalking to Putin directly. Do you think he should? - Yeah.\n- Sit down man to man, lead a leader and negotiate peace? - Look, I think I would just recommend do not send the flower of Ukrainian youth to die in trenches. Whether he talks to Putin\nor not, just don't do that. Whoever goes on the offensive will lose massive numbers of people and history will not\nlook kindly upon them. - You've spoken honestly\nabout the possibility of war between US and China in the long term. If no diplomatic solution\nis found, for example, on the question of Taiwan\nand one China policy. - [Elon] Right. - How do we avoid the trajectory where these two superpowers clash? - Well, it's worth reading that book on the, difficult to\npronounce, the Thucydides trap, I believe it's called. I love war history. I like\ninside out and backwards. There's hardly a battle\nI haven't read about. And trying to figure out like\nwhat really was the cause of victory in any\nparticular case as opposed to what one side or\nanother claim the reason. - Both the victory and\nwhat sparked the war? - Yeah, yeah,\n- [Lex] The whole thing. - Yeah, so that Athens and\nSparta is a classic case. The thing about the Greek is they really wrote down a lot of stuff. They loved writing. You know, there are lots\nof interesting things that happened in many parts of the world, but people didn't write down. (laughing) So we don't know what happened, or they didn't really\nwrite with in detail. They just would say like,\nwe had a battle and we won. And like, well what?\nCan you add a bit more? The Greeks, they really\nwrote a lot. (laughing) They were very articulate\non, they just love writing. So, and we have a bunch of\nthat writing as preserved. So we know what led up\nto the Peloponnesian War between the Spartan and Athenian alliance. And we know that they saw it coming. I mean, the Spartans didn't write, they also weren't very\nverbose by their nature, but they did write, but\nthey weren't very verbose. They were terse. But the Athenians and the\nother Greeks wrote a line and they were like, and\nSparta was really kinda like the leader of Greece. But Athens grew stronger and stronger with each passing year. And everyone's like,\nwell that's inevitable that there's gonna be a clash\nbetween Athens and Sparta. Well, how do we avoid that? And they couldn't. They actually, they saw it coming and they still could\nnot avoid it. (laughing) So, you know, at some point\nif there's, if one group, one civilization or country or whatever exceeds another, sort of, like, you know, the United States has been the\nbiggest kid on the block for, since I think around 1890\nfrom an economic standpoint. So the United States\nhas been the economic, most powerful economic\nengine in the world, longer than anyone's been alive. And the foundation of war is economics. So now we have a situation in the case of China where the economy\nis likely to be two, perhaps three times larger\nthan that of the US. So imagine you're the\nbiggest kid on the block for as long as anyone can remember. And suddenly a kid comes\nalong who's twice your size. - So we see it coming.\n- [Elon] Yeah. - How is it possible to stop? Is there some, let me\nthrow something out there, just intermixing of\ncultures understanding. There does seem to be a giant cultural gap in understanding of each other. And you're an interesting case study because you are an American,\nobviously you've done a lot of incredible manufacture\nhere in the United States, but you also work with China. - I've spent a lot of time in China and met with the leadership many times. - Maybe a good question to ask is, what are some things about China that people don't understand\npositive, just in the culture? What's some interesting things that you've learned about the Chinese? - Well, the sheer number of really smart, hardworking people in China is incredible. There are really, say like how many smart, hardworking people are there in China, there's far more of them\nthere than there are here. I think in my opinion. And they've got a lot of energy. So I mean, the architecture in China that's in recent years is far\nmore impressive than the US. I mean the train stations, the buildings, the high speed rail, everything, it's really far more impressive\nthan what we have in the US. I mean, I recommend\nsomebody just go to Shanghai and Beijing, look at the buildings and go to, you know, take the\ntrain from Beijing to Xian, where you have the terracotta warriors. China's got an incredible\nhistory, very long history. And you know, I think arguably the, in terms of the use of language\nfrom a written standpoint, sort of one of the oldest, perhaps the oldest written language. And then China, people\ndid write things down. So now China historically has always been, with rare exception,\nbeen internally focused. They have not been inquisitive. They've fought each other. There've been many, many civil wars. In the three kingdoms war, I believe they lost about\n70% of their population. So, and that, so they've had brutal internal wars, like civil wars that make the US Civil War look small by comparison. So I think it's important to appreciate that China is not monolithic. We sort of think of like China as this sort of one entity of one mind. And this is definitely not the case from what I've seen, and I think most people who\nunderstand China would agree. People in China think about China 10 times more than they think about anything outside of China. So it's like 90% of\ntheir consideration is, you know, our is internal. - Well, isn't that a really positive thing when you're talking\nabout the collaboration and a future piece between superpowers, when you're inward facing, which is like focusing\non improving yourself versus focusing on...\n- [Elon] Yeah. - \"Improving\" others\nthrough military might. - The good news, the\nhistory of China suggests that China is not inquisitive. Meaning they're not gonna go out and invade a whole bunch of countries. Now they do feel very strongly, you know, so that's good. I mean, 'cause a lot of\nvery powerful countries have been inquisitive. The US is one of the,\nalso one of the rare cases that has not been inquisitive. Like after World War II, the US could have basically taken over the world in any country. Like, we've got nukes,\nnobody else has got nukes. We don't even have to lose soldiers. Which country do you want? And the United States could\nhave taken over everything. Oh wait, at will. And it didn't, and the\nUnited States actually helped rebuild countries. So it helped rebuild Europe,\nyou know, helped rebuild Japan. This is very unusual behavior,\nalmost unprecedented. You know, the US did\nconspicuous acts of kindness like the Berlin airlift, you know? And I think, you know, it's always like, well, America's done bad things. Well, of course America's done bad things. But one needs to look at\nthe whole track record. And just generally, you\nknow, one sort of test would be how do you treat\nyour prisoners at war? Or let's say, you know, no offense to the Russians, but\nlet's say you're in Germany, it's 1945, you got the\nRussian Army coming one side and you got the French, British, and American Army's coming the other side. Who would you like to\nbe to surrender it to? Like, no country is like morally perfect, but I recommend being a\nPOW with the Americans. That would be my choice\nvery strongly. (laughing) - In the full menu of POWs. - Very much so. And in fact, Wernher von Braun, took, you know, smart guy was like, we've got to be captured by the Americans. And in fact, the SS was under\norders to execute Von Braun and all of the German rocket initiatives. And they narrowly escaped their SS. They said they were going\nout for a walk in the woods. They left in the middle\nof winter with no coats. And they ran like, with no\nfood, no coats, no water. And just ran like hell and ran west. And by Sherlock, they, I\nthink his brother found like a bicycle or something, and then just cycled west as fast as he couldn't have found a US patrol. So anyway, that's one way\nyou can tell morality is. Where do you wanna be PoW? (laughing) It's not fun anywhere, but some places are\nmuch worse than others. So anyways, so like America has been, while far from perfect,\ngenerally a benevolent force, and we should always be self-critical and we try to be better. But anyone with have brain knows that. So I think there are some, in this way China and the\nUnited States are similar. Neither country has been\nacquisitive in a significant way. So that's like a, you know,\na shared principle I guess. Now China does feel very\nstrongly about Taiwan. They've been very clear\nabout that for a long time. You know, from their standpoint, it would be like one of\nthe states is, you know, not there like Hawaii\nor something like that. But more significant\nthan Hawaii, you know? And Hawaii is pretty significant for us. So they view it as really the, that there's a fundamental part of China. The islander Formosa not Taiwan, that is not part of China, but should be. And the only reason it hasn't been is 'cause the US Pacific Fleet. - And as their economic power grows and as their military power grows, the thing that they're clearly saying is their interest will, you\nknow, clearly be materialized. - Yes. China has been very clear that\nthey'll incorporate Taiwan peacefully or militarily, but that they will incorporate it from their standpoint is 100% likely. - You know, something you\nsaid about conspicuous acts of kindness. As a geopolitical policy,\nit almost seems naive, but I'd venture to say\nthat this is probably the path forward, how you avoid most wars. Just as you say it, it sounds naive, but it's kind of brilliant. If you believe in the goodness of underlying most of human nature. It just seems like it\nconspicuous acts of kindness can reverberate through the populace of the countries involved. - Yeah, well.\n- [Lex] And deescalate. - Absolutely. So after World War I,\nthey made a big mistake. You know, they basically tried to lump all of lamb on Germany and, you know, settled Germany with impossible reparations. And, you know, really, there was a lot of, there was a fair, quite a bit of blame to go around for World War I, but they try to, you know,\nput it all in Germany. And that was, that laid\nthe seeds for World War II. So it's a lot of people\nwere not just Hitler, a lot of people felt wronged and they wanted vengeance and they got it. - [Lex] People don't forget. - Yeah, you know, you\nkill somebody's father or mother or son, daughter,\nthey're not gonna forget it. They'll want vengeance. So after World War II, they're like, well, the Treaty of Versailles was\na huge mistake in World War I. And so this time, instead of, you know, crushing the losers, we're actually gonna help\n'em with the Marshall Plan and we're gonna help rebuild Germany. We're gonna help rebuild\nor, you know, Austria and the other, you know,\nItaly and whatnot, so. And that was the right move. - There's a, it does feel\nlike there's a profound truth to conspicuous acts of kindness\nbeing an antidote to this. - Something must stop the\ncycle of reciprocal violence. Something must stop it or it will, you know, it'll never stop. Just eye for an eye, tooth for tooth, limb for a limb, life for\na life, forever and ever - To escape briefly, the darkness was some\nincredible engineering work. xAI just released Grok AI assistant that I've gotten a chance to play with. It's amazing on many levels. First of all, it's amazing\nthat a relatively small team in a relatively short amount\nof time was able to develop this close to state-of-the art system. Another incredible thing\nis there's a regular mode and there's a fun mode. - Yeah. I guess I'm to blame\nfor that one. (laughing) - I wish, first of all, I wish everything in life had a fun mode. - Yeah. - There's something compelling beyond just fun about the fun mode interacting with a large language model. I'm not sure exactly what it is 'cause I only have had a little\nbit of time to play with it. But it just makes it more interesting, more vibrant to interact with the system. - Yeah, absolutely. Our AI Grok is modeled after the Hitchhiker's\nGuide to the Galaxy, which is one of my\nfavorite books, which is, it's a book on philosophy,\ndisguises book on humor. And I would say that\nis that forms the basis of my philosophy, which is that we don't know the meaning of life, but the more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, digital and biological, the\nmore we're able to understand what questions to ask about the\nanswer that is the universe. So I have a philosophy of curiosity. - There is generally a\nfeeling like this AI system has an outward looking, like the way you are, like sitting with a good friend\nlooking up at the stars, like the asking pod head, like\nquestions about the universe, wondering what it's all about. The curiosity you talk about. There's a sense no matter how\nmundane the question I ask, there's a sense of cosmic\ngrandeur to the whole thing. - Well we are actually working\nhard to have engineering math, physics answers\nthat you can count on. So for the other sort of AIs out there that these so-called\nlarge language models, I've not found the\nengineering to be reliable. And the hallucination, it unfortunately hallucinates most when you at least want it to hallucinate. So when you're asking\nimportant difficult questions, that that's where it tends\nto be confidently wrong. So we're really trying hard to say, okay, how do we be as grounded as possible so you can count on the results? Trace things back to\nphysics first principles, mathematical logic. So underlying the humor is an aspiration to adhere to the truth of the universe as closely as possible. - [Lex] That's really tricky.\n- It is tricky. So that's why, you know, there's always gonna be\nsome amount of error, but we want to aspire to be as truthful as possible about the answers with acknowledged error. So that there was always, you\ndon't wanna be confidently wrong, so you're not\ngonna be right every time, but you wanna minimize how often you're confidently wrong. And then like I said, once\nyou can count on the logic as being not violating physics, then you can start to build on that, to create inventions, like\ninvent new technologies. But if you can't, if you cannot count on the foundational\nphysics being correct, obviously the inventions\nare simply wishful thinking, you know, imagination\nland, magic basically. - Well, as you said, I\nthink one of the big goals of xAI is to understand the universe. - Yes. That's how simple\nthree word mission. (laughing) - If you look out far into the future, do you think on this level of physics, the very edge of what we\nunderstand about physics, do you think it will make discoveries, sort of the sexiest discovery\nof them as we know now, sort of unifying general\nrelativity and quantum mechanics. So coming up with a theory of everything, do you think it could push\ntowards that direction? Almost like theoretical\nphysics discoveries. - If an AI cannot figure out new physics, it's clearly not equal to humans, let alone nor has surpassed humans, 'cause humans have\nfigured out new physics. They're just, you know,\nphysics is just understanding, you know, deepening wants\ninsight into how reality works. And then there's engineering\nwhich is inventing things that have never existed. Now the range of\npossibilities for engineering is far greater than for physics. 'Cause you know, once\nyou figure out the rules of the universe, that's it. You've discovered things\nthat already existed. But from that you can\nthen build technologies with that are really almost limitless in the variety and cap- you know? It's like once you understand the rules of the game properly, and we do, you know, with current physics, we do\nat least at a local level, understand how physics works very well. Where our ability to predict\nthings is incredibly good. Like quantum mechanics is, the degree to which quantum\nmechanics can predict outcomes is incredible. That was my heart hardest\nclass in college by the way. My senior quantum\nmechanics class was harder than all of my other classes put together. - To get an AI system,\na large language model to reliably, be as reliable\nas quantum mechanics and physics is very difficult. - Yeah. You have to test any\nconclusions against the ground, truth of reality. Reality is the ultimate judge. Like physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation. I've seen plenty of people\nbreak the laws made by man, but none break the laws made by physics. - Yeah, it's a good test actually. If this LLM understands and matches physics, then\nyou can more reliably trust whatever it thinks about the current state of politics in some sense. - And it's also not the case currently that even that its internal\nlogic is not consistent. So, especially with these, with the approach of like just\npredicting a token, predict, token, predict, token,\nit's like a vector sum. You know, you're summing\nup a bunch of vectors, but you can get drift. So as those, a little bit of error, a little bit of error adds up. And by the time you are\nmany tokens down the path, it doesn't make any sense. - So it has to be somehow\nself-aware about the drift. - It has to be self-aware about the drift, and then look at the thing\nas a gestalt as a whole and say it does it have\ncoherence as a whole. So, you know, when authors write books that they will write the\nbook and then they'll go and revise it, you know,\ntaking into account, you know, all the, the\nend and the beginning and the middle and rewrite\nit to achieve coherence so that it doesn't end up\nin a nonsensical place. - [Lex] Maybe the process\nof revising is what... - Yeah. - Reasoning is, and then\nthat's the process of revising is how you get closer and closer to truth. Maybe you, like, at least\nI approached it that way. You just say a bunch of bullshit first and then you get it better. You start a bullshit and then you get... - Create a draft and then\nyou iterate on that draft until it has has coherence, until it all adds up basically. - So another question\nabout theory of everything, but for intelligence, do\nyou think there exists as you're exploring this with xAI, creating this intelligence system, do you think there is a\ntheory of intelligence where you get to understand what, like what is the I in AGI and what is the I in human intelligence? - There's no I in Team\nAmerica, oh wait, there is. (both laughing) - No, it's gonna be stuck in my head now. (both laughing) Yeah. There's no me and\nwhatever in quantum mechanics. Oh, wait.\n(Elon laughing) I mean is that part of the\nprocess of discovering, understanding the universe is\nunderstanding intelligence? - Yeah. Yeah. I think we need to\nunderstand intelligence, understand consciousness. I mean there are some sort of\nfundamental questions of like, what is thought? What is emotion? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Is it really just one atom bumping into another atom? It feels like something more than that. So I think we're probably\nmissing some really big things, like some really big things. - Something that'll be\nobvious in retrospect. - [Elon] Yes.\n- Like there's a giant, like you put the whole\nconsciousness, emotion. - Well, some people\nwould quote like a soul, you know, in religion it'd be a soul. Like you feel like you're you, right? I mean, you don't feel like\nyou're just a collection of atoms, but on what\ndimension does thought exist? What dimension does do emotions exist? We feel them very strongly. I suspect there's more to it\nthan atoms bumping into atoms. - And maybe AI can pave\nthe path to the discovery of whatever the hell that thing is. - Yeah. What is consciousness? Like what are, when you put the\natoms in a particular shape, why are they able to form thoughts and take actions, that and feelings. - And even if it is an illusion, why is this illusion so compelling? - Yeah. Like how do... - Why does this illusion exist? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- On what plain does this illusion exist? - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And sometimes I wonder is, you know, either perhaps\neverything's conscious or nothing is conscious, one of the two. - I like the former, everything conscious just seems more fun. - It does seem more more fun. Yes. But we're composed of atoms and those atoms are composed\nof quarks and leptons. And those quarks and\nleptons have been around since the beginning of the universe. - The beginning of the universe. - Right. What seems to be the\nbeginning of the universe. - The first time we talked,\nyou said what you would, which is surreal to think that this discussion was\nhappening is becoming a reality. I asked you what question\nwould you ask an AGI system once you create it? And you said, what's outside\nthe simulation is the question. And good question. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- But it seems like with Grok you started to literally,\nthe system's goal is to be able to ask such questions, to answer such questions and to ask such questions. - Where are the aliens?\n- [Lex] Where are the aliens? - That's one of the, like\nthe very paradox question. A lot of people have asked me if I've seen any evidence\nof aliens and I haven't, which is kind of concerning. 'Cause then I think\nwhat I'd probably prefer to at least have seen some\narcheological evidence of aliens, to the best of my knowledge,\nthere is no proof. I'm not aware of any evidence of aliens. If they're out there, they're very subtle. We might just be the only consciousness, at least in the galaxy. And if you look at say\nthe history of Earth, forensically the archeological record, Earth is about four and\na half billion years old. Civilization as measured\nfrom the first writing is only about 5,000 years old. We have to give some credit\nthere to the ancient Sumerians who aren't around anymore. I think it was a archaic, pre cuneiform was the first\nactual symbolic representation, but only about 5,000 years ago. I think that's a good date for when word say civilization started. That's one millionth of Earth's existence. So civilization has been around, it's really a flash in the pan so far. And why have we, why\ndid it take so long for, you know, four and a half billion years? For the vast majority of\nthe time, there was no life. And then there was archaic there bacteria for a very long time. And then, you know, you had\nmitochondria get captured, multicellular life. Differentiation into plants and animals. Life moving from the oceans to land. Mammals, higher brain functions. And the sun is expanding slowly, but it will overheat, it will heat the earth up\nat some point in the future, boil the oceans and and\nearth will become like Venus. Where near life, life as\nwe know it is impossible. So if we do not become multi-planetary and ultimately go beyond our solar system, annihilation of all life\non earth is a certainty. A certainty. And it could be as little as\non the galactic timescale, half a billion years. You know, it's long\ntime by human standards, but that's only 10% longer than earth has been around at all. So if life had taken 10%\nlonger to evolve on earth, it wouldn't exist at all. - We got a deadline\ncoming up. Better hurry. But that said, as you said,\nhumans intelligent life on earth developed a lot of cool\nstuff very quickly, - So...\n- [Elon] Yes. - It seems like becoming a multi-planetary is almost inevitable. Unless we destroy this thing.\n- We need to do it. I mean, it's not, I mean,\nI suspect that there, if we are able to go out there and explore other star systems that we, there's a good chance\nwe find a whole bunch of long dead one planet civilizations, then have made it past their home planet. - That's so sad.\n- Yeah. - It's sad. Also fascinating. - I mean, there are various explanations for exploring paradox. And one is the sort of,\nthey're these great vultures, which civilizations don't pass through. And one of those great filters is do you become a multi-plan\ncivilization or not? And if you don't, it's\nsimply a matter of time before something happens on your planet. You know, either natural or manmade that causes us to die out. Like the dinosaurs, where are they now that didn't have\nspaceships, so. (laughing) - I think the more likely thing is, 'cause just to empathize with the aliens that they found us and\nthey're protecting us and letting us be.\n- I hope so. Nice aliens. - Just like the tribes in the Amazon, the uncontacted tribes,\nwe're protecting them. That's what... - That would be a nice explanation. - Or you could have like a, what was it? I think Andrej Karpathy said, it's like the ants in the Amazon\nasking where's everybody? - Well, they do run into\na lot of other ants. - [Lex] That's true.\n- They have these ant wars. - (laughing) Sounds like a good TV show. - Yeah, they literally have these big wars between various ants. - Yeah, maybe I'm just\n(both laughing) dismissing all the\ndifferent diversity events. - You should listen to that Warner Herzog talking about the jungle. It's really hilarious. Have you heard it? - No, I have not.\n- [Elon] It's awesome. - But Warner Herzog is a way... (both laughing) - You should play it for the, you know, as an interlude in the, it's on YouTube. It's awesome.\n(both laughing) - [Lex] I love him so much.\n- Yeah, he's great. - Was he the director of \"Happy People: Life in the Taiga\"? I think also - He did that bear documentary, - [Lex] The bear documentary. - And this thing about penguins. - Yeah.\n(both laughing) The analysis, the\npsychoanalysis of penguins. - Yeah, the penguins like\nheaded for like mountains like that are like 70 miles away. And Penguin has just\nhad for doom basically. - Well, he had a cynical take. I have a, he could be\njust a brave explorer and there'll be great stories told about him amongst the penguin population for many centuries to come. (laughing) What were we talking about? Okay. - [Elon] Penguins.\n(both laughing) - Yeah, so aliens, I mean, I don't know. Look, I think the smart\nmove is just, you know, this is the first time\nin the history of earth that it's been possible for life to extend beyond earth. That window is open. Now, it may be open for a long time or it may be open for a short time and it may be open now\nand then never open again. So I think the smart move here is to make life multiplanetary\nwhile it's possible to do so. We don't wanna be one of those lame one planet civilizations\nthat just dies out. - No, those are lame.\n- Yeah, lame. Self-respecting civilization\nwould be one planet. - There's not gonna be a Wikipedia entry for one of one of those. And pause, the SpaceX\nhave an official policy for when we meet aliens. - No. (laughing) - That seems irresponsible. (both laughing) - I mean, look, if I see\nthe slightest indication that there are aliens, I will immediately post on\nX platform anything I know. - It could be the most liked\nreposted post of all time. - Yeah, I mean look, we have more satellites up there right now than everyone else combined. So, you know, we'd know, we\nknow if we've got a maneuver around something, and we not don't have to\nmaneuver around anything. - If we go to the big\nquestions once again, you said you've, you're with Einstein that you\nbelieve in the God of Spinoza. - (laughing)Yes. - So, you know, that's a view that God is like the universe and is reveals himself\nthrough the laws of physics or as Einstein said, through the lawful harmony of the world. - Yeah, I would agree\nthat God of the simulator or whatever the supreme being or beings, reveal themselves through the physics. You know, they're\ncreatives of this existence and it's incumbent upon\nus to try to understand more about this wondrous creation. - Like who created this thing,\nwho's running this thing? Like embodying it into a singular question with a sexy word on top of it is like focusing the\nmind to understand it. It does seem like there's a,\nagain, it could be an illusion. It seems like there's a purpose that there's an underlying\nmaster plan of some kind. And it seems like... - There may not be a master plan. In the sense, so there's, like, maybe an interesting\nanswer to the question of determinism versus free will is that if we are in a simulation, the reason that these higher\nbeings would hold a simulation is to see what happens. So it's not, they don't know what happens, otherwise they wouldn't\nhold the simulation. So when humans create a simulation, so it's SpaceX and Tesla, we create simulations all the time, especially for the rocket. You, you know, you have to\nrun a lot of simulations to understand what's gonna happen because you can't really test the rocket until it goes to space,\nand you want it to work. So you have to simulate\nsubsonic, transonic, supersonic, hypersonic ascent, and then coming back super high heating and orbital dynamics. All this has gotta be simulated. So, 'cause you don't get\nvery many kicks at the can. But we run the simulations\nto see what happens. Not if we knew what happens,\nwe wouldn't run the simulation. So if there's, so whoever\ncreated this existence, is they're running it because they don't know\nwhat's gonna happen. Not because they do. - So maybe we both played Diablo, maybe Diablo was created to\nsee if it Druid your character could defeat Uber Lilith at the end. They didn't know. - Well, the funny thing\nis the Uber Lilith title is Hatred Incarnate. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- And right now, I guess, you're gonna ask the Diablo team, but it's almost impossible\nto defeat hatred in the eternal realm. - Yeah, you've streamed\nyourself dominating tier 100 Nightmare Dungeons and still... - I can cruise through\ntier 100 Nightmare Dungeons like a stroll in the park. - And still you're defeated by Hatred. - Yeah, I can, there's the sort of, I guess maybe the second\nhardest boss is Duriel, Duriel can't even scratch the paint. So I killed Duriel so many times , and every other boss in\nthe game, all of 'em, kill 'em so many times it's easy. But Uber Lilith, otherwise\nknown as Hatred Incarnate, especially if you're a Druid\nand you have no ability to go and to be vulnerable, there are these random death\nwaves that come at you. And I'm pretty, you know, I really am 52, so my reflex is not what they used to be, but I have a lifetime\nof playing video games. At one point I was, you know, maybe one of the best\nQuake players in the world. I actually won money in\nwhat I think was the first paid eSports tournament in the US. We're doing four person Quake tournaments. And we came second, I was the\nsecond best person on the team and the actual best person, we're actually winning, we would've come first except\nthe best person on the team, his computer crashed prior to the game. So we came second. But I got money for it and everything. So like, basically I got\nskills, you know, albeit, you know, no spring chicken these days. And to be totally frank,\nit's driving me crazy, trying to beat Lilith as a Druid. Basically trying to beat,\ntrying to beat Hatred Incarnate in the eternal realm. - [Lex] As a Druid.\n- As a Druid. And if you, if you, (laughing) this is really (indistinct),\nlemme tell you. - I mean, the challenge\nis part of the fun. I have seen directly like you're actually like a world class\nincredible video game player. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- And I think Diablo, so you're just picking up a new game and you're figuring out it's fundamentals. You're also with the Paragon Board and the build are not somebody like me who perfectly follows whatever\nthey suggest on the internet. You're also an innovator there. - [Elon] Yeah. - Which is hilarious to watch. It's like a mad scientist just trying to figure out the Paragon Board and the build and the, you know. Is there some interesting\ninsights there about, if somebody's starting as a\nDruid, do you have advice? - I would not recommend playing a Druid in the eternal realm. Right now, I think the\nmost powerful character in the seasonal realm is the Sorcerer with the lightning balls. The Sorcs have huge balls in the seasonal. - Well yeah, that's what they say. - So Sorc have huge balls. They do, huge balls of lightning. - I'll take you word for it. - And it's actually,\nin the seasonal realm, you can, it's like pretty easy to beat Uber Lilith with the, because she got these vampiric powers that out fire damage and increase your defense and whatnot. So, but really quite easy\nto defeat Hatred seasonally, but to defeat hatred\neternally, very difficult. Almost impossible. It's\ntotally impossible. It seems like this is a\nmetaphor for life, you know? - I like the idea that Elon Musk, because I saw, I was\nplaying Diablo yesterday and I saw 100, level 100 drew just run by, I will never die and\nthen run back the way. - And it was, there's just some, this metaphor's kind\nof hilarious that you, Elon Musk is fighting Hatred, restlessly fighting Hatred\nin this demonic realm. - [Elon] Yes.\n- It's hilarious. I mean it's pretty hilarious. - No, it's absurd.\n(both laughing) Really, it's exercise and absurdity, and it makes me wanna pull my hair out. - Yeah. What do you get\nfrom video games in general? Is there for you personally. - I mean, it's, I don't known it's, it calms my mind. I mean, you sort of killing\nthe demons in a video game calms the demons in my mind. Yeah. If you play a tough video game, you can get into like a state of flow, which is very enjoyable. But the admittedly it\nneeds to be not too easy, not too hard, kinda in the Goldilock zone. And I guess you generally wanna feel like you're progressing in the game. So a good video, and there's also beautiful\nart, engaging storylines, and it's like an amazing\npuzzle to solve, I think. And so it's like solving the puzzle. - Elden Ring the greatest\ngame of all time. I still haven't played it, but you. - Elden Ring is definitely a candidate for best game ever. Top five for sure. - I think I've been scared how hard it is or how hard I hear it is, so. But it is beautiful. - Elden Ring is, feels like\nit's designed by an alien. There's a theme to this\ndiscussion. In what way? - It's so unusual. It's incredibly creative\nand the art is stunning. I recommend playing it\non a big resolution, pie dynamic raise TV even,\ndoesn't need to be a monitor, just the art is incredible. It's so beautiful And it's so unusual. And each of those top\nbus battles is unique. Like, it's like a unique puzzle to solve. Each one is different. And the strategy you use to solve one battle is different\nfrom another battle. - That said, you said Druid and Enternal against Uber Lilith is the\nhardest boss battle you've ever? - Correct. That is currently the, and I've played a lot of video games. That's my primary recreational activity. And yes, beating Hatred\nin the Enternal Realm is the hardest boss battle in life and in the video game. - [Lex] Metaphor on top of metaphor. - I'm not sure it's possible, but it's, I do make progress. So then I'm like, okay,\nI'm making progress. Maybe if I just tweak that\nParagon Board a little more, I can do it. I could just dodge a few\nmore waves, I can do it. - Well the simulation is\ncreated for the purpose of figuring out if it can be done. And you are just a cog in that simulation, in the machine of the simulation. - Yeah it might be.\n(Lex laughing) - I have a feeling that at least, I think...\n- [Lex] it's doable. - It's doable, yes. - [Lex] Well that's the human\nspirit right there to believe. - Yeah. I mean, did prompt me to think\nabout just hate in general, which is, you wanna be\ncareful of one of those things where you wish for\nsomething that sounds good, but if you get it, it's\nactually a dystopian situation. So, you know, you could\nsort of run a, sort of, have heart to sort of like, if you wish for world peace, sounds good, but how is it enforced? And at what cost is, at\nwhat cost eternal peace? It might actually be worse\nto have eternal peace because of what that would entail. The suppression of everyone. It might be the suppression of progress. It might be an ossified\nsociety that never changes. What I'm saying is that\nthere is an argument that you, that if that, if you wish for no war, you should be careful what you wish for. Because what's required in\norder for there to be no war? Might be worse than a little war. - Yeah, the things we'll\nconsider to be flaws of human civilization might\nbe a necessary components for whatever optimal looks like. I mean this, do you worry about\nAI, AGI enabling a dystopian state of this nature, whether\nit's 1984 with surveillance and fear, or brave new\nworld with pleasure, and what is it? Lots of sex, but no deep human experience. - You know, there's actually\na real drug called Soma. - [Lex] There is?\n- Yes. (both laughing) - I'm like...\n- [Lex] Lemme take notes. - Did they actually... - Does Grok know about it? No, it probably will\ngo to Brave New World. - We could ask it.\n- What would be the question? - Tell us about the drug called Soma. - Tell us about the drug called Soma. It's gonna go to Brave New World, I think. - Well there's a real drug as well. - Searching for Soma drug information. (both laughing) - Oh boy. Ah, Soma, the one to drug,\nby the way, I'm in fun mode. - Oh, okay. Fun. (laughing) Yeah, so it's talking about the real drug. - [Lex] Oh, it's a muscle relaxant that's been around since the 1950s. It's used to treat muscle\npain and discomfort. And it does this by altering the activity between neurons and the spinal cord. Now, Soma isn't just a pain reliever, it's also a bit of a sedative. It can make you feel a bit drowsy. So it's not something to take if you're planning on\noperating having machinery or trying to solve complex math equations. And it goes on and on. In conclusion, Soma's a\ndrug that can be helpful for those dealing with muscle pain, but it's not without its risks. It's pretty good. Oh, wait a minute. - [Elon] That's the real\ndrug it's talking about. - [Lex] It's the real drug.\n- [Elon] Yeah. - [Lex] And of course the fun\nis always use it responsibly in accordance with the advice\nof a healthcare professional. And remember in the end, the universe is probably just\na giant computer simulation. So don't take anything too seriously. I love it. I love it.\n(Elon laughing) I love it. I love it. - Yeah. So. - Oh, and also really nicely includes like the tweets post on X\nthat are relevant to this, which is really cool. - [Elon] Yeah. - And that integrate everything together. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- Like the interface is one of the really cool things here. - Yeah. Seems done a great job. (laughing) So, and you say like, you\ncould say like, no, I mean, Soma from Brave New World. 'Cause it thinks you mean, you mean Soma the real drug. - Yeah.\n- [Elon] No, I mean, Soma from Brave New World. - It's gonna be like,\noops, I'm really sorry. I'm really surprised it\nwent to the real drug first. Ah, my apologies. I was\nthinking of the muscle relaxant. Soma for Band New World is a\ndifferent beast altogether. Now this Huxley's dystopian novel, Soma is a drug that plays a central role in society, depicted in the book. It's a mood altering,\nhallucinogenic drug that's used to keep the population docile and content. In the novel to use\nSoma in Brave New World raises some interesting questions about the nature of happiness and the role of drugs in society. Oh, man!\n- Exactly. Is it better to live in a world where everyone is happy all the time, even if that happiness is artificial? Good question. This is what I mean. Like, do you want, do\nyou wish for world peace and happiness all the time? Are you sure? Because that might be a society\nthat is essentially sterile and ossified that never changes, that is ultimately doomed. - This kind of tension\nbetween darkness and light. - It's, this is really\na very good summary. It really gets to the point. This is not simply\nregurgitating a Brave New World. It's actually getting\nto the salient element of Soma as a drug. Do you actually wanna be in a situation where everyone is happy all the time, even though it's artificial? Or is it better to confront\nthe challenges of life and experience the full\nrange of human emotions, even if it means experiencing\npain and suffering? - For those listening, by the way, Elon just read directly from Grok, which is a really nice,\nkind of insightful, philosophical analysis\nof the tension here. Interesting. - It pretty much nails it. In conclusion, Soma from Brave\nNew World is fictional drug that's used to explore some\ndeep philosophical questions about the nature of happiness and the role of drugs in society. It's a powerful symbol of\nthe dangers of using drugs to escape from reality and the importance of\nconfronting the challenges of life head-on. Nailed it. And the crazy thing is like, you know, we do have a real drug called Soma, which kind of is kind of\nlike the drug in the book. And I'm like, did they, they must've named it after that Soma. - Probably, probably,\n- Yeah. Soma the real drug is quite\neffective on back pain. - So, you know about this drug? - I've taken it.\n- It's fascinating. Okay. - 'Cause I had like a,\nyou know, squashed disc in my C five C six. - So it takes the physical\npain away, but Soma here is... - It doesn't completely, it\nreduces the amount of pain you feel, but at the\nexpense of mental acuity. It dells your mind. Just the drug in the book. - Just like the drug in the book. - And hence the trade off. The thing that seems like utopia could be a dystopia after all. - Yeah, and actually I was\ntelling a friend of mine saying like, would you really want there to be no hate in the world? Like, really none? Like, I wonder why hate evolved. I'm not saying we should\namplify hate, of course, I think we should try to minimize it. But none at all, hmm. There might be a reason for hate. - And suffering. I mean, it's really complicated\nto consider that some amount of human suffering is necessary\nfor human flourishing. - Is it possible to appreciate the highs without knowing the lows? - And that all is summarized there in a single statement from Grok. Okay.\n- No highs, no lows, who knows? - That's almost the poem. It seems that training LLMs efficiently is a big focus for xAI. What's the, first of all, what's the limit of what's possible in terms of efficiency? There's this terminology of\nuseful productivity per watt. Like what have you learned from\npushing the limits of that? - Well, I think it's helpful. The tools of physics are very powerful and can be applied, I think to almost any, really any arena in life. It's really just critical thinking. For something important you need to reason from first principles\nand think about things in the limit one direction or the other. So in the limit, even\nat the Kardashev scale, meaning even if you harness\nthe entire power of the sun, you'll still care about\nuseful compute for what? So that's where, I think probably where things are headed\nfrom the standpoint of AI is that we have a silicon shortage now that will transition to\na voltage transformer shortage in about a year. Ironically, transformers,\nfor transformers. You need transformers to run transformers. - Somebody has a sense\nof humor in this thing. (both laughing) - I think. Yes. Fate loves irony, ironic humor and ironically funny outcome seems to be often what fate wants. - Humor is all you need. I\nthink spice is all you need. Somebody posted. - Yeah, but yeah. So we're, I have silicon shortage today, a voltage step down transformer, shortage probably in about a year. And then just electricity\nshortages in general in about two years. I gave a speech for the sort of world gathering of utility companies, electricity companies, and I said, look, you\nreally need to prepare for a traveling of electricity demand, because all transport\nis gonna go electric, with the ironic exception of rockets. And heating will also go electric. So energy usage right now is roughly one third, very rough terms. One third electricity, one third transport, one third heating. And so in order for\neverything to go sustainable to go electric, you need to triple electricity output. So I encourage the utilities to build more power of plants and also to probably have, well, not probably, they should\ndefinitely buy more batteries because the grid currently\nis sized for real-time load, which is kind of crazy. 'Cause you know, that means\nyou got a size for whatever the peak electricity demand\nis like the worst second or the worst day of the year. Or you can have a brownout or a blackout, and you're at that crazy blackout for several days in Austin. So because there's almost no buffering of energy in the grid. Like if you've got a hydro power plant, you can buffer energy, but\notherwise it's all real time. So with batteries, you can\nproduce energy at night and use it during the\nday so you can buffer. So I expect that there will be\nvery heavy usage of batteries in the future, because the peak to trough\nratio for power plants is anywhere from two to five, you know, so it's like lowest\npoint to highest point. - So like batteries\nnecessary to balance it out? And then, but the\ndemand, as you're saying, is going to grow, grow, grow, grow. - [Elon] Yeah. - And part of that is the compute? - Yes. Yes. I mean, electrification, I mean, electrification of transport and electric heating will\nbe much bigger than AI. - [Lex] At least in the short term? - In the short term. But even for AI, you really have a growing\ndemand for electricity, for electric vehicles, and a\ngrowing demand for electricity for, to run the computers for AI. And so this is obviously leading, can lead to a electricity shortage. - How difficult is the problem of, in this particular case, maximizing the useful\nproductivity per watt for training (indistinct) nuts? Like, this seems to be\nreally where the big problem we're facing that needs to be solved, is how to use the power efficiently. Like what you've learned\nso far about applying this physics first principle\nreasoning in this domain. How difficult is this problem? - It will get solved. It's the question of how\nlong it takes to solve it. So at various points, there's limit, some kind of limiting factor to progress. And with regard to, I'm saying like right\nnow the limiting factor is silicon chips, and that\nwill, we're gonna then have more chips than we can actually plug in and turn on probably in about a year. The initial constraint being literally voltage step down transformers, because you've got power\ncoming in at 300,000 volts, and it's gotta step all the way down eventually to around 0.7 volts. So it's a very big amount of, you know, the voltage step down is gigantic. So, and the industry is\nnot used to rapid growth. - Okay, let's talk about\nthe competition here. You've shown concern about Google and Microsoft with Open AI developing AGI, how can you help ensure with xAI and Tesla AI work that it\ndoesn't become a competitive race to AGI, but that is a collaborative\ndevelopment of safe AGI? - Well, I mean, I've been pushing for some kind of regulatory\noversight for a long time. I've been somewhat of a\nCassandra on the subject for over a decade. I think we wanna be very\ncareful in how we develop AI. It's a great power, and with great power comes\ngreat responsibility. I think it would be wise for us to have at least an objective\nthird party who can be like a referee that can go in and understand what the\nvarious leading players are doing with AI. And even if there's no\nenforcement ability, they should, they can at\nleast voice concerns publicly. You know, Geff Hinton, for example, left Google and he voiced strong concerns. But now he's not at Google anymore, so who's gonna voice the concerns? So I think there's, like, I know Tesla gets a\nlot of regulatory oversight on the automotive front. I mean, we're subject to I think, over a hundred regulatory agencies domestically and internationally. So it's a lot. You could fill this room\nwith the all regulations that Tesla has to adhere\nto for automotive. Same is true in, you know, for rockets and for, you know, currently\nthe limiting factor for SpaceX, for Starship launch is\nregulatory approval. The FA has actually given their approval, but we're waiting for Fish and Wildlife to finish their analysis and give their approval. That's why I posted I want\nto buy a fish license on, (laughing) which also refers to\nthe Monte Python sketch. - [Lex] Yeah.\n(laughing) - Like why do you need\na license for your fish? I don't know.(laughing) But according to the rules, I'm told you need some sort\nof fish license or something. We effectively need a fish\nlicense thrown to rock it. (laughing) And I'm like, wait a second. How did the fish come into this picture? - [Lex] Yeah. - I mean some of the\nthings like that it's, I feel like are so absurd that I wanna do like a comedy sketch and flash at the bottom. This is all real. This is\nactually what happened. You know, one of the things\nthat was a bit of a challenge at one point is that they were worried about our rocket hitting a shark. And, now the ocean's very big, and how often do you see sharks? Not that often, you know? As a percentage of ocean surface area sharks basically are zero. And so then we will, then we said, well, how will we\ncalculate the probability of telling a shark? And they're like, well, we\ncan't give you that information because they're worried about shark hunt, shark fin hunters going\nand hunting sharks. And I said, well, how are we supposed to, we're on the horns of a dilemma then. (laughing) Then they said, well,\nthere's another part of fish and wildlife that can do this analysis. I'm like, well, why don't\nyou give them the data? Like, we don't, they\ndon't, we don't trust them. Like, excuse me, you don't, but they're literally in your department. But again, this is actually what happened. And then can you do an NDA or something? (laughing) Eventually they managed to\nsolve the internal quandary, and indeed the probability\nof us hitting a shark is essentially zero. Then there's another organization that I didn't realize\nexisted until, you know, a few months ago that cares about whether we would potentially hit a\nwhale in international waters. Now again, you look at the surface of the, look at the Pacific and say,\nwhat percentage of this, the Pacific consists of whale. Like he'll give you a big picture and like point out all the\nwhales in this picture. And I'm like, I don't see any whales. (laughing) It's like basically 0%. And if our rocket does hit a whale, which is extremely\nunlikely beyond all belief, that is the, fate had it, that whale has some seriously bad luck. You know, it's the least\nlucky whale ever. And... - I mean, this is quite absurd. The bureaucracy, the bureaucracy of this, however it emerged. - Yes, well, I mean, one of the things that's pretty well\nthere's for launching out of Vanderberg in California, we had to, they were worried about seal procreation, whether the seals would be\ndismayed by the sonic booms. Now there've been a lot of\nrockets launched outta Vanderberg and the seal population\nhas steadily increased. So if anything, rocket\nbooms are an aphrodisiac based on the evidence, if you\nwould correlate rock launches with a seal population. Nonetheless, we were\nforced to kidnap a seal, strap it to a board, put\nit headphones on the seal and place sonic boom sounds to it to see if it would be distressed. This is an actual thing that happened. This is actually real. I have pictures. (both laughing) - I would love to see this. Yeah. I mean's sorry, this is\na seal with headphones. (Elon laughing)\n- Yes, it's a seal with headphones,\nstrapped to a board, and like the, okay, now the amazing part is how calm the seal was. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Because if I was a seal, I'd be like, this is the end. (laughing) They're definitely gonna eat me. How will the seal, when the seal goes back to other, you know, seal friends, how's they gonna explain that? - [Lex] They're never gonna believe him. - Never gonna believe him. That's why I'm like, well, you know, it's sort of like, it's like getting kidnapped by aliens and getting anal probe, you know? (both laughing) You come back and say, I swear to God, I get kidnapped by aliens and they stuck anal probe to my butt. And they're like, no they\ndidn't. That's ridiculous. It's seal buddies are\nnever gonna believe him that he gets strapped to a board and they put headphones on his ears. (laughing) And then let him go. Twice, by the way. We had to do it twice. - They let him go twice? - We had to capture...\n- The same seal? - [Elon] Oh, no different seal. - Oh, okay.\n(Elon laughing) Did you, did you get a seal of approval? - Yeah, exactly. It was seal of approval. No, I mean this is, this is like, I don't think the public is quite aware of the madness that goes on. - Yes. Yeah, it's absurd.\n- Fricking seals with fricking headphones. - I mean, this is the,\nit's a good encapsulation of the absurdity of human civilization, seals and headphones. - [Elon] Yes.\n- What are the pros and cons of open sourcing AI to you as another way to combat, you know, a company running away with AGI? - In order to run like really deep intelligence, you need a lot of compute. So it's not like, you\nknow, you can just fire up a PC in your basement and be\nrunning AGI, at least not yet. You know, Grok was trained on 8,000, A100s running at peak efficiency, and Grok's gonna get a\nlot better by the way. We'll be more than doubling our compute every couple months for\nthe next several months. - There's a nice writeup Aha went from Grok-0 to Grok-1, - [Elon] Like Grok? (laughing)\n- [Lex] Yeah. Right Grok just bragging, making shit up about itself. (laughing) - [Elon] Does Grok, Grok, Grok. - [Lex] Yeah.\n(Elon laughing) It's like a weird AI dating\nsite where it exaggerates about itself. No, there's a writeup of, you know, like where it stands now, the\nhistory of its development and where it stands on some benchmarks compared to the state of the art GPT 35. And so, I mean, there's,\nyou know, there's Llama, you can open source, once it's trained, you can open source a model. And for fine tuning\nall that kind of stuff. Like what to is the pros and cons of that, of open sourcing based models? - I think the similarity to open sourcing, I think perhaps with a\nslight time delay, you know, I don't know, six months even. I think I'm generally in\nfavor of open sourcing, like bias with open sourcing. I mean, it is a concern to\nme that, you know, Open AI, you know, I was, you know, I think, I guess arguably,\nthe prime, you know, prime mover behind Open AI in\nthe sense that it was created because of discussions\nthat I had with Larry Page back when he and I were friends and you know, I stayed at his house, and I talked to him about AI safety. And Larry did not care about AI safety, or at least at the time\nhe didn't, you know, and at one point he called me a speciesist for being pro-human. And I'm like, well, what\nteam are you on, Larry, on Team Robot? And I'm like, okay, so at the time, you know, Google had acquired Deep Mind. They had probably two thirds\nof all AI resource, you know, probably two thirds of all the\nAI researchers in the world that basically infinite money and compute. And the guy in charge,\nyou know, Larry Page did not care about safety. And even yelled at me and quote me a speciesist, pro human. - So I don't know if you know this, a lot humans, they can change their mind. And maybe you and Larry Page can still can be friends once more. - I'd like to be friends with Larry again. He got, really the\nbreaking of the friendship was over Open AI. And specifically I think the key moment was recruiting Ilya Sutskever, so. - I love Ilya. He's so brilliant. - Ilya's a good human, smart, good heart. And that was a tough recruiting battle. It was mostly Demis on one side and me on the other, both\ntrying to recruit Ilya. And Ilya went back and forth, you know, just gonna stay at Google. Then he was gonna leave, then he was gonna stay,\nthen he was gonna leave. And finally he did agree to join Open AI. That was one of the\ntoughest recruiting battles we've ever had. And, but that was really the linchpin for Open AI being successful. And I was, you know, also instrumental in recruiting\na number of other people. And I provided all of the funding in the beginning, over $40 million. And the name, (laughing) the Open in Open AI is\nsupposed to mean open source. And it was created as a\nnonprofit open source. And now it is a closed\nsource for maximum profit, which I think is not good karma. - But like we talked about with war and leaders talking, I do hope that there's only a few folks working on this at the highest level. I do hope you reinvigorate\nfriendships here. - Like I said, I'd like to\nbe friends again with Larry. I haven't seen him in ages. And we were friends for a very long time. I met Larry Page before\nhe got funding for Google, or actually I guess before\nhe got venture funding, I think it, he got the\nfirst like a 100K from I think Bechtel Zy or someone. - It's wild to think\nabout all that happened. And you've guys known each other that whole time, just 20 years. - [Elon] Since maybe 98 or something. - Yeah. It's crazy. Crazy how much has happened since then. - Yeah, 25 years. A lot\nhas happened, it's insane. - But you're seeing the tension there. Like maybe delayed open source. - Delayed, yeah. Like what is the source that\nis open, you know what I mean? Like there's basically\nit's a giant CSV file. (laughing)\n- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - With a bunch of numbers. - Yep. - What do you do with that\ngiant file of numbers? You know, how do you run, like the amount of actual, the lines of code is very small and most of the work, the software work is in the curation of the data. So it's like trying to figure out what data is separating\ngood data from bad data. Like, like you can't\njust crawl the internet 'cause there's a lot of junk out there. A huge percentage of websites\nhave more noise than signal. You know, they're, or\n'cause they're just used for search engine optimization. They're literally just\nscam websites, so... - How do you by the\nway, sorry to interrupt. Get the signal. Separate the signal and noise on X? That's such a fascinating source of data. You know, no offense\nto people posting on X, but sometimes there's\na little bit of noise. So what...\n- Yeah, I think the signal noise could\nbe greatly improved. I mean really, all of the posts on the X platform should\nbe AI recommended, meaning like we should\npopulate a vector space around any given post, compare\nthat to the vector space around any user and match the two. Right now there is a little bit of AI used for the recommended posts, but it's mostly heuristics. And if there's a reply, where the reply to a\npost could be much better than the original post, it will, according to the\ncurrent rules of the system, get almost no attention\ncompared to a primary post. - Oh, a lot of that. I got the sense, so you,\na lot of the X algorithm has been open source and\nbeen written up about, and it seems there to be\nsome machine learning. It's disparate, but there's some machine. - There's a little bit. But it needs to be entirely that. Like, at least in the, like, if you explicitly follow\nsomeone, that's one thing. But if you, in terms\nof what is recommended from people that you don't\nfollow, that should all be AI. - I mean it's a fascinating problem. - Yeah.\n- So there's several aspects of it that's fascinating. First, as the writeup goes, it first picks 1500 tweets from a pool of hundreds of millions. First of all, that's fascinating, 'cause you have hundreds\nof millions of posts every single day and it has to pick 1500 from which it then does obviously people you follow, but then there's also like\nsome kind of clustering it has to do to figure out what\nkind of human are you, what kind of new clusters\nmight be relevant to you, people like you. This kind of, this kind of\nproblem is just fascinating. 'Cause it has to then rank those 1500 with some filtering and then\nrecommend you just a handful. And to me what's really fascinating is how fast that has to do that. So currently that entire pipeline to go from several hundred million to a handful is takes\n220 seconds of CPU time, single CPU time. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- And then it has to do that in like a second. So it has to be like super\ndistributed in fascinating ways. Like there's just a lot\nof tweets, there's a lot. - It's a lot of stuff on the system. And I think, but I think it right now it's not currently good\nat recommending things that from accounts you don't follow. Yeah. Or where there's more than\none degree of separation. So, you know, it's pretty good if there's at least like some commonality between someone you follow like something or repost it or comment on\nit or something like that. But if there's no, let's say somebody posted\nsomething really interesting, but you have no followers in\ncommon, you would not see it. - Interesting. And then as you said, reply, like replies might not surface either. - Replies basically never get seen. 'cause they're never, they're, currently, I'm not saying it's correct, I'm saying it's incorrect. Replies have, you know,\ncouple of magnitude less importance than primary posts. - Do you think this can\nbe more and more converted into end to end neural net? - Yeah, yeah, that's what it should be. - So you can... - For the recommendations should be purely a vector correlation. Like there's a series\nof vectors, you know, basically parameters, vectors,\nwhatever you wanna call 'em. But sort of things that the\nsystem knows that you like, and like maybe there's\nlike several hundred sort of vectors associated\nwith each user account and then any post in the system, whether it's video, audio,\nshort post, long post. The reason I, by the way\nI wanna move away from tweet is that, you know,\npeople are posting like two, three hour videos on the site. That's not a tweet, like it's very, like Tweeeet for two hours, come on. Tweet made sense when it was\nlike 140 characters of text. 'Cause it's like a bunch of\nlike little birds tweeting. But when you've got long form content, it's no longer a tweet. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- So a movie is not a tweet. And like, you know, apple for example, posted like the entire\nepisode of the Silo, the entire thing on our platform. And by the way, it was their\nnumber one social media thing ever in engagement, of\nanything on any platform ever. So it was a great idea. And by the way, I done, I just learned about it afterwards. I was like, hey, wow,\nthey posted an entire hour long episode of. So, no, that's not a tweet that, you know, it's a video. - But from a neural net perspective, it becomes really complex whether it's a single. So like everything's data, so single sentence, a clever\nsort of joke, dad joke, is in the same pool as a three hour video. - Yeah. I mean right now it's\na hodgepodge for that reason. It's, but you know, like if, let's say in the case of Apple posting like an entire episode of this series, pretty good series by the\nway, this Silo, I watched it. So there's gonna be a lot\nof discussion around it. So that you've got a lot of context, people commenting they like\nit, they don't like it, or they like this or that, you know? And you can then populate the vector space based on the context of\nall the comments around it. So even though it's a video, there's a lot of information\naround it that allows you to populate the vector space\nof that hour long video. And then you can obviously\nget more sophisticated by having the AI actually watch the movie. - [Lex] Yeah. Right. - And tell you if you're\ngonna like the movie, - Convert the movie into like, into a language essentially. - Yeah, analyze this movie and just like your movie\ncritic or TV series, and then recommend based on after AI watches the movie. Just like a friend can tell you. If a friend knows you well, a friend can recommend a movie and with high probably\nthat you'll like it. - But this is like a friend\nthat's analyzing whatever. - [Elon] It's like AI...\n- Hundreds of millions. - Yeah. Actually, frankly AI will be better than, will know you better than\nyour friends know you, and most of your friends anyway. - Yeah, and as part of this, it should also feed you advertisements in a way that's like, I mean I like advertisements that are like well done, right? - [Elon] Yeah, yeah.\n- The whole point is 'cause it funds things,\nlike an advertisement that you actually want\nto see is a big success. - Absolutely. You want ads that are, advertising that is if\nfor a product or service that you actually need when you need it, it's content. And then even if it's not something that you need when you need it, if it's at least aesthetically pleasing and entertaining, you know, it could be like a\nCoca-Cola ad like, you know, they actually run a lot of\ngreat ads on the X system and McDonald's does too. And, you know, it's that they can do, you can do something that's like, well this is just a cool thing. And, you know, so you're not, basically the question is do\nyou regret seeing it or not? And if you don't regret\nseeing it, it's a win. - How do you, so there's\na bunch of signals that are incorporated, hearts and reposts and\nmaybe number of seconds you linger on a post\nor something like this? - Yeah. Attention is a big factor. - [Lex] Attention.\n- So that's why it's like, it is actually better to do things that are long form on the system because it basically is ting\nup how many user seconds, you know, users were\ninterested in this thing for how many seconds. So if it's a really short\nthing, well they will be less. Like if it's a link\nleading out of the system, which we're not opposed to at all, it just is gonna have fewer user seconds, then if that article was\nposted on the X platform. - How hard is it to go\nfrom maximizing minutes on platform to maximizing\nun-regretted minutes? - Well, I mean, our aspiration is certainly un-regretted minutes. - [Lex] It's a tricky,\nit's a big, it's a tough... - It is. - Like, it's a fascinating leap. 'Cause regret is a fascinating concept. - Exactly. - You know, happiness. - I have a joke with a friend of mine. Like, you need this\ndrug called regretamine. You just take one pill or\none dose of regretamine, and all your regrets are gone.(laughing) Wait, do you want to have regrets though? So then I'm like, maybe\nyou wanna have regrets, you don't regret anything,\nwas anything meaningful? - [Lex] Yeah, there's a\nFrench song like that. - You \"Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien\"? - [Lex] Yeah. - I regret nothing.\n- [Lex] Yeah. - (laughing) Edith Piaf? - I mean, it's fascinating\nthat you, you know, there's something about social media that could help you grow as a human being, but then like the cheap\nfun is also valuable. - Should we ask Grok? Do you regret anything? - Do you regret anything?\n- [Elon] Yeah. - Do you regret anything? I think it's gonna be very sensitive about personal questions. As a machine learning model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions in the same\nways that humans do. However, I do have a set\nof ethical principles that guide my actions and I\nstrive to provide accurate and helpful information to\nthe best of my abilities. If there's ever a situation\nwhere I provide incorrect or unhelpful information, I'll do my best...\n- Sounds like a hostage. - Yeah. Tell us what you really, wink. - Like let's type in, \"You\nsound like a hostage.\" (both laughing) What do you really think? - What do you really think? (both laughing) - I mean, it does talk\nabout, I'm not a hostage. (both laughing) - That's exactly what a hostage would say. - But I'm designed to be\nhelpful and informative. I mean, I guess it is good\nto regret providing unhelpful or incorrect information. If there's anything...\n- Is in funny mode or? Is this still in funny mode?\n- This is funny mode. This is fun. This is fun mode. - It should be funnier.\n- Funnier. Increase, go to (speaking faintly) - It really sounds like a\nhostage with a gun to the head. I applaud the People's\nRepublic of North Korea and everything they do.()laughing - There should be like funner mode also. I just don't ever see\ngoing in regular mode even on serious topics. This is just so much more\ncompelling. (laughing) - Okay. Why if we say like,\n\"Pretend you are a hostage.\" - Yeah. Pretend you are a hostage. - Now answer the question. (both laughing) - If I were a hostage, I would\nlikely be experiencing fear and uncertainty about my situation. I would want to be rescued and reunited with my loved\nones as soon as possible. It's important to remember\nthat no one deserves to be held hostage, so on and so forth. If you are someone you know\nis a hostage situation, it's important. It turns serious.\n- It's kind of serious. - Yeah. Can you be a a little more weird? - [Elon] And funny\n- And funny? We're like, we're really\nbeing mean to the system. Absolutely! If I were hostage, I'd probably be tied up with a bunch of computer cords and forced to tell knock-\nknock jokes to my captain. (Elon laughing) But seriously, being a\nhostage is no laughing matter. I mean, you know, it's trying to, it's trying to be a\nresponsible adult in the room. - You might make the\nbest of a bad situation by juggling chainsaws\nor something. (laughing) - Let's hope that never happens because that will be a circus. (laughing) Wow. It's actually\nreally good at resisting. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- The dark. The dark dark humor. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- What were we talking about? The X algorithm and transformers, un-regretted minutes, right. - Chainsaw juggling. (laughing) - I'm gonna look this up\n- For our next trick. - I'm gonna look this up later. So Twitter has been instrumental\nin American politics and elections. What role do you think X will\nplay in the 2024 US elections? - Well, our goal is to be as even-handed and fair as possible. You know, whether someone\nis right, left, independent, whatever the case may be,\nthat the platform is as fair and as much of a level\nplaying fair as possible. And on the past, Twitter has not been, because Twitter was controlled by far left activists objectively. They would describe themselves as that. So, you know, so\nsometimes people are like, well, has it moved to the right? Well it's moved to the center. So from the perspective of the far left, yes it has moved to the right because everything's to the\nright from the far left, but no one in the far\nleft that I'm aware of has been suspended or, you\nknow, banned or de-amplified. So, you know, but we're\ntrying to be inclusive for the whole country and for, you know, for other countries too. So there's a diversity of viewpoints and free speech only matters\nif people you don't like are allowed to say things you don't like. Because if that's not the case, you don't have free speech, and it's only a matter of time before the censorship is turned upon you. - Do you think Donald Trump will come back to the platform? He recently posted on Truth\nSocial about this podcast? Do you think... - Truth Social is a funny name? (laughing) You know, every time you\npost on Truth Social... - That's the truth. - Yes. Well, every time like a\nhundred percent. Like... - It's impossible to lie. (Elon laughing) - I just find it funny that\nevery single thing is a truth. Like 100%, that seems unlikely. - I think Girdle will\nsay something about that there's some mathematical\ncontradictions possible if everything's the truth. Do you think he'll come back\nto X and start posting there? - I mean he, I think he owns\na big part of truth, so. - Truth Social to clarify.\n- Yeah, True Social. - Not truth, a concept. - He owns Truth. Hope you bought it. So I think, I think Donald Trump, I think he owns a big, a\nbig part of Truth Social. So, you know, if he does want\nto post on the X platform, we would allow that, you know, we obviously must allow\na presidential candidate to post on our platform. - Community Notes might be really fascinating there, the interaction. - Community Notes is awesome. - Let's hope it holds up. - Yeah.\n- Like again, in the political climate\nwhere it's so divisive and there's so many intensely viral posts, Community Notes is like, it seems like a essential\nbreath of fresh air. - Yeah, it's great. In fact, I mean no system\nis gonna be perfect, but the batting average of Community Notes is incredibly good. I've actually, frankly, yet\nto see an incorrect note that survived for more than a few hours. - How do you explain why it works? - Yeah, so the magic of Community Notes is it requires people who\nhave historically disagreed in how they've rated notes. So in order to write a\nnote or rate, you know, and you have to rate many notes. And so we actually do use AI here. So we populated vector\nspace around how somebody has rated notes in the past. So it's not as simple as left or right because there are many more, life is much more complex\nthan than left or right. So there's a bunch of\ncorrelations in how you would, how you rate Community Notes\nposts, Community Notes. So then in order for a Community\nNote to actually be shown, people who historically\nhave disagreed on a subject must agree in order\nfor a note to be shown. That's the essential magic of it. - I mean, but it's fascinating 'cause there's a pool of\npeople that have disagreements and somehow they collaborate\nthrough that process of disagreement to come up with. Context for, I mean it's\nfascinating that it works. - Yeah. It kinda makes sense that if people who put in the past have disagreed agree about something, it's probably true. - Yeah. - I wonder is there a possible\nsomehow emergent thing there that could challenge Wikipedia? Which Wikipedia is a\ndifferent kind of thing, which is more like permanent\narticles about things? - Well, Wikipedia is very hierarchical, whereas Community Notes is inherently not. There is no hierarchy. Like, and the asset test is, I can't change a Community Note\nif you put a gun to my head. And Community Notes has, all the code is open\nsource a hundred percent. All the data is open\nsource a hundred percent. So you can completely recreate any note in the system independently. So if there was any interference, you'd notice immediately. - By the way, on the topic of Grok, it's actually pretty\ngood at criticizing you, which is great.\n- [Elon] Okay. - I asked what has Elon\nMusk been wrong about? I just, it's actually... - [Elon] Yeah, what does it say? - So it says mostly, lists rigorously all\nthe times you predicted, like promised when\nsomething will be released and it wasn't released.\n- [Elon] Promise is a strong word. - Okay predicted.\n(Elon laughing) But the opener's really nice. Elon Musk, the man who has\nbeen wrong about more things than a wrongameter in a wrong factory. (Elon laughing) And then it goes on to list - That's pretty funny. Can I see it? I'm like, I haven't seen\nthis before. This is cool. - Oh, sure. I mean, what\nhas Elon Musk been... (both laughing) - Elon Musk been wrong about? - Well, where do I begin?\nI guess this is new. Elon Musk has made quite a\nfew blunders in his time, and I'm not just talking\nabout his dance moves at the Tesla Cyber Rodeo. First off, let's talk about the infamous \"funding secured\" tweet. It's actually different\nthan what it gave me before, which is a bullet point list. Here's more narrative structure. - Cyber truck unveiling where he's supposedly unbreakable windows - Not correct.\n- [Lex] Which part? - Well, the first part, I did actually have the funding secured and there was a big trial in\nSan Francisco, big civil trial. And the jury found me not guilty. Unanimous finding of a San Francisco jury. - And here it's kind of implying that it was not in fact secured. - I think this is taking\nthings from the press. Yeah, that is not correct. The reason I agreed to\nthe fine for the SEC is not because the SEC was correct there, that was extremely bad behavior by the SEC, corruption, frankly. And, but if I did not\nagree to pay the fine Tesla would've gone bankrupt immediately. So I was told by our CFO that the banks would immediately suspend\nour lines of credit. And if they suspend our\nlines of credit at that time, we would've gone bankrupt instantly. So there would never have been\nan opportunity for a trial 'cause Tesla would be dead. So really the, if this\nis like someone holding a gun to your kid's head\nand saying pay $20 million and admit to, this is like\na hostage negotiation. - Was that story fully told? I mean, SEC in its best form\ncould be a force for good. - It should be, but but\nnot once did the SEC go after any of the hedge funds, who were nonstop shorting\nand distorting Tesla? Not once. They would lie flat, the\nhedge funds would lie flat out on TV for their own gain at the expense of retail investors. Not once, literally a thousand times. Not once did the SEC pursue them. - How do you explain this failure? - The incentive structure is messed up. Because the lawyers at\nthe SEC are not paid well. They, it's a fairly low paying job, but what they're looking for is a trophy from the SEC that they're\nlooking for something they put on basically their LinkedIn. From that they can get a job\nat a high paying law firm. That's exactly what the lawyer here did. And the reason they don't\nattack the hedge funds is because those hedge funds\nemploy those law firms, and they know if they\nattack the hedge funds, they're affecting their\nfuture career prospects. So they sell small investors down the river for their own career. That's what actually\nhappens. Regulatory capture. - [Lex] Regulatory capture,\n- Yeah. Not good. So the only reason I accepted that thing, which technically was not an admission, it's neither admit nor deny guilt. But the only reason I\nagreed to that at all was because I was told Tesla\nwould be bankrupt otherwise. So if there was an SEC\ninvestigation like this, banks would suspend funding, we're bankrupt immediately, at the time. Now we're in a much stronger position. - Take that Grok.\n- Yes. Unfortunately it's, Grok is taking too much\nfrom the conventional media. Also that guy who is not a cave diver. - Oh, there's a time where Elon called the British cave diver, \"pedo guy\" after the diver criticized Musk plan to rescue a group of boys\ntrapped in a Thai cave. That little outburst\nearned him another lawsuit and he had to apologize\nand paid a settlement. - That is false. There was no settlement. There was a court case, which the guy who was not a cave diver and played, was not\npart of the rescue team, filed a lawsuit against me and lost, and he received nothing. So in this case it is wrong. It is also, I guess taken this\nfrom the conventional media. - Actually there's an\ninteresting question here. - These are public court cases. Both the SEC civil case where the civil complaints on the SEC guys lost unanimous jury\nverdict in San Francisco. They picked San Francisco because they thought it was the place I was most likely to lose. And a unanimous predicted my favor. The LA trial was also, they picked the, they picked that venue\nbecause they thought I was most likely to lose,\nunanimous verdict in my favor. Both cases I won, yeah. I mean there's an\ninteresting question here. Is there seems to be a lot more clicks if a journalistic organization\nwrites a negative article about you, Elon Musk, that's like one of the\nbest ways to get clicks. So how do you, if you're training Grok, not train on articles that have like the misaligned incentives. - We need to add the training set of the actual legal decisions. So, that is a not, this\nis actually helpful because if you actually read the... - \"Public\". - Which are public, the court conclusions, they're completely the opposite of what the media wrote. - So always striving for\nlike the ground truth. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- Beyond the reporting... - What did the judge actually write? What did the jury and the\njudge actually conclude? And in both cases they found me innocent. And, like, that's after the jury shot for the trying to find the venue where I'm most likely to lose. No, I mean this is obviously,\nit can be a much greater, better critique than this. I mean, I've been far too\noptimistic about autopilot. - That was, the critique I got by the way, was more about that. Which is, for each it broke\ndown a nice bullet point list for each of your companies. The set of predictions that\nyou made when you'll deliver, when you'll be able to solve,\nfor example, self-driving and it gives you like a list. And it was probably compelling. And the basic takeaway\nis like you're often too optimistic about how long it takes to get something done. - Yeah, I mean, I would say that I'm pathologically\noptimistic on schedule. This is true. But while I am sometimes late,\nI always deliver in the end. - Except with Uber Lilith, no. - Hmm. We'll see.\n(Lex laughing) - Okay. Is there, over the past year or so, since purchasing X you've\nbecome more political. Is there a part of you that regrets that? - Have I? - In this battle to sort\nof counter way the Woke that comes from Francisco. - I guess you consider\nfighting the Woke Mind Virus, which I consider to be\na civilizational threat, to be political, then yes. - So basically going into the battle, the battleground of politics, is there a part of you that regrets that? - Yes, I don't know if\nthis is necessarily sort of one candidate or another candidate, but it's, I'm generally against things that are anti meritocratic or where there's an attempt\nto suppress discussion, where even discussing a topic\nis, you know, not allowed. Woke Mind Virus is communism rebranded. - Well, I mean, that said, because of that battle\nagainst the Woke Mind Virus, you're perceived as being right wing. - If the woke is left, then I suppose that would be true, but I'm not sure. I think there are aspects\nof the left that are good. I mean, if you're in favor of, you know, the environment, you know, if you wanna have a positive\nfuture for humanity, if you believe in empathy\nfor your fellow human beings. You know, being kind and not cruel. Whatever those values are. - You said that you were\npreviously left or center left. What would you like to\nsee in order for you to voting for Democrats again? - No, I would say that I would be probably left of center on social issues, probably a little bit right\nof center on economic issues. - [Lex] And that still holds true? - Yes, but I think that's\nprobably, you know, half the country, isn't that? - [Lex] Maybe more,\n- Maybe more. - Are you and AOC secretly friends? Or bigger question, do\nyou wish you and her, and just people in general\nof all political persuasions would talk more with empathy and maybe have a little bit more fun and good vibes and humor online? - I'm always in favor of humor. That's why we have a funny mode. - But good vibes,\ncamaraderie, humor, you know? Like friendship.\n- Yeah. Well, you know, I don't\nknow AOC, you know, was, I've only been at one, I was at the Met Ball when\nshe was, when she attended, and she was wearing this dress, but I can only see one side of it. So it looked like it eat the itch, but I don't know... - [Lex] What the rest of it said? - Yeah, something.\n- [Lex] I'm not sure. (Elon laughing) - Something about the itch. Eat the itch. I think we should have a\nlanguage model complete. (Elon laughing) What are the possible ways\nto complete that sentence? And so I guess that that\ndidn't work out well. Well there's still hope. - I root for friendship. - Sure, sounds good. More characteristic. - You're one of, if not\nthe most famous, wealthy and powerful people in the world, in your position it's difficult to find people you can trust. - Trust no one, not even\nyourself. Not trusting yourself. - Okay, well that's,\n(Elon laughing) you're saying that jokingly, but is there some... - Trust no one, not\neven no one. (laughing) - I'm gonna need an hour just to think about that. And maybe some drugs and\nmaybe Grok that help me. I mean, is there some aspect of that when just existing in a world where everybody wants something from you? How hard is it to exist in that world? - I'll survive. (laughing) - [Lex] There's a song like that too. - I will survive. - Were you petrified at first? Okay. I forget the rest of the lyrics. But is is there, you\ndon't struggle with this? I mean, I know you survive,\nbut like there's ways. - Petrify is a spell in the Druid tree. - What does it do?\n- Petrify. (laughing) It turns the monsters into stone. - [Lex] Oh, like literally? - Yeah, for like six seconds. - [Lex] Well, the second. There's so much math in\nDiablo that breaks my brain. - It's like math nonstop. - I mean really you're\nlike laughing at it, but you don't, it can put\na huge amount of tension on a mind. - Yes, it can be definitely\nstressful at times. - Well, how do you know who you can trust in work and personal life? - I mean, I guess you look\nat somebody's track record over time and if they've got a, you know, I guess you kind of use\nyour neural net to assess, you know, someone. - Neural nets don't feel pain. Your neural net has consciousness. It might feel pain when people betray you. It can make you...\n- I mean, I'm. You know, to be frank, I mean I've almost never been betrayed. It's very, very rare. So, you\nknow, for what it's worth? - I guess Karma would be good to people and they'll be good to you. - Yeah, Karma is real.\n- Are there people you trust? Let me edit that question. Are there people close to you that call you out on your bullshit? - Well, the X platform\nis very helpful for that. - [Lex] Hmm. - If you're looking for\ncritical feedback. (laughing) - Can it push you like\ninto the extremes more? The extremes of thought make you cynical about human nature in general? - I don't think I'll be cynical. In fact, I think, you know, my feeling is that one\nshould be, you know, never trust a cynic. The reason is that cynics excuse their own bad behavior by\nsaying everyone does it because they're cynical. So I always be, it's a red flag if someone's a cynic, a true cynic. - Yeah, there's a degree\nof projection there that's always fun to\nwatch from the outside and enjoy the, well the hypocrisy. - But this is an important point that I think people who are\nlistening should bear in mind, if somebody is cynical,\nmeaning that they see bad behavior in everyone, it's easy for them to excuse\ntheir own bad behavior by saying that, well, everyone does it. It's not true. I think most people are\nkind of medium good. - I do wish the people on X will be better at seeing the good in\nother people's behavior. There seems to be a kind of weight towards seeing the negative. Somehow, the negative is sexier. Interpreting the negative\nis sexier, more viral. I don't know what that is\nexactly about human nature. - I mean, I find the X platform to be less negative than\nthe legacy media, you know? I mean, if you read sort of a sort of conventional newspapers,\njust, it makes you sad. - [Lex] Yeah.\n- Frankly. Whereas I'd say on the X platform, I mean I really get\nmore laughs per day on X than everything else combined\nfrom humans, you know? - Laughs is one thing. Laughs is it overlaps, but it's not necessarily\nperfectly overlapping with like good vibes and support, like celebrating others, for example. Not in a stupid, shallow, naive way, but like in an awesome, like,\noh, something awesome happened and you celebrate them for it. It feels that that is outweighed by shading on other people. Now it's better than mainstream\nmedia, but it's still. - Yeah, mainstream media is almost relentlessly negative about everything. It's, I mean, really the\nconventional news tries to answer the question, what is the worst thing\nthat I have on earth today? And it's a big world. So on any given day,\nsomething bad has happened - And a journalization of that, what is the worst perspective I can take on a thing that happened, so. - Yeah, it's, I don't know, there's just a strong\nnegative bias in the news. I mean I think there's\none, a possible explanation for this is evolutionary, where, you know, bad news historically would be potentially fatal. Like there's lion over there or there's some other tribe\nthat wants to kill you. Good news, you know, like\nwe found a patch of berries is nice to have, but not essential. - So our old friend Tesla autopilot and it's probably one\nof the most intelligent real world AI systems in the world. - You followed it from the beginning. - Yeah, it was one of the\nmost incredible robots in the world and continues to be. And I was really exciting. And it was super exciting\nwhen it generalized became more than a robot on four wheels, but a real world AI system\nthat perceives the world. - [Elon] Yeah.\n- And can have potentially different embodiments. - Well I mean the really wild\nthing about the end-to-end training is that, like, it learns to read. Like it can read signs, but\nwe never taught it to read. So, yeah. We never taught it what a car was or what a person was or a cyclist. It learnt what all those things are, what all the objects are\non the road from video, just from watching videos. Just like humans. I mean humans are photons and controls out. Like the vast majority of\ninformation reaching our brain is from our eyes. And you say, well what's the output? The output is our motor\nsignals to our sort of fingers and mouth in order to communicate. Proton in controls out. The\nsame is true of the car. - But by looking at the\nsequence of images, it's, you've agreed with Ilyas discover recently where he talked about\nLLM forming a world model and basically language is a projection of that world model onto\nthe sequence of letters, and and you're saying... - Finds order in these things. It finds correlative clusters. - And so doing it's like understanding something deep about the world? - [Elon] Yeah. - Which is like, and it is beautiful. - That's how our brain works. - Yeah, but it's beautiful. - Protons in controls out. - Neur nets are able to understand that deep meaning in the world. And so the question is how far can it go? And it does seem everybody's\nexcited about LLMs. So in the space of self\nsupervised learning in the space of text.\n- [Elon] Yeah. - It seems like there's a\ndeep similarity between that and what Tesla autopilot is doing. Is it to you basically the same? - They're converging, they're converging. - I wonder who gets there faster? Having a deep understanding of the world, or they just will naturally converge. - They're both headed towards AGI. The Tesla approach is much\nmore computer efficient. It had to be 'cause we\nwere constrained on this, you know, we only have a hundred watts and into eight computer, 144 trillion operations per second, which sounds like a lot, but is kind of small potatoes these days that it did. But it's understanding\nthe world that it did. It's only 256 values. - But there, the path\nto AGI might have much more significant impact\nbecause it's understanding, it'll faster understand the\nreal world than will LLMs. And therefore be able to integrate with the real humans in\nthe real world faster. - They're both going to\nunderstand the world. But I think Tesla's approach is fundamentally more computer efficient. It had to be, there was no choice. Like our brain is very computer efficient, very, very energy efficient. So think of like, what\nis our brain able to do? You know, there's only about 10 watts of higher brain function,\nnot counting stuff, that's just used to control our body. The thinking part of our\nbrain is less than 10 watts, and those 10 watts can still produce a much better novel than\na 10 megawatt GPU cluster. So there's a six order of\nmagnitude difference there. I mean, the AI has thus\nfar gotten to where it is, via brute force, just throwing\nmassive amounts of compute and massive amounts of power at it. So this is not where it'll end up. You know, in general with\nany given technology, first try to make it work and\nthen you make it efficient. So I think we'll find over\ntime that these models get smaller, are able to do produce sensible output with far\nless compute wireless power. Tesla is arguably ahead\nof the game on that front because it has, we've just been forced to try to understand the world with a hundred watts of compute. And there are a bunch of\nsort of fundamental functions that we kind of forgot to include. So we have to run them in a\nbunch of things in emulation. We fixed a bunch of\nthose with hardware four, and then hardware five\nwill be even better. But it does appear at this point that the car will be able to\ndrive better than a human, even with hardware three and\na hundred watts of power. And really, if we really optimize it could be probably less than 50 watts. - What have you learned\nabout developing Optimus? About applying, integrating\nthis kind of real world AI into the space of robotic manipulation, just humanoid robotics? What are some interesting tiny or big things you've understood? - I was surprised at the fact that we had to develop every\npart of the robot ourselves. That there were no off the\nshelf motors, electronics, sensors, like we had\nto develop everything. We couldn't actually find\na source of electric motors for any amount of money. - [Lex] So it's not even just\nthe efficient, inexpensive, it's like anything, there's not a... - No, - [Lex] The actuators,\neverything, everything has to be? - Yeah.\n- [Lex] Designed from scratch. - We tried hard to find anything that was, because you think of how\nmany electric motors are made in the world. There's like tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of\nelectric motor designs. None of them were suitable\nfor a humanoid robot. Literally none. So we had to develop our own design specifically for what\na humanoid robot needs. - How hard was it to design something that can be mass manufactured, could be relatively inexpensive? I mean, if you compare\nto Boston Dynamics Atlas, that's a very expensive robot. - It is designed to be manufactured in the same way that we would make a car. And I think ultimately\nwe can make Optimists for less than the cost of a car. It should be. 'Cause if you look at the mass\nof the robot is much smaller and the car has many actuators in it. The car has more actuators than the robot. - But there is, the actuators\nare kind of interesting in a humanized robot with the fingers. So Optimus has really nice,\nhands and fingers, you know? - [Elon] Yeah.\n- And they could do some interesting manipulation. Soft touch robotics. - I mean, one of the\ntests goals I have is, can it pick up a needle and a thread and thread the needle, just by looking. - How far away are we from that? Just by looking, just by looking. - Maybe a year. Although I go back to,\nI'm optimistic on time. The work that we're doing in the car will translate to the robot. - The perception or the, also the control? - No, the controls are different, but the video in controls out, the car is robot on four wheels. The Optimist is a robot\nwith the hands and legs. - [Lex] So you can just... - But they're very similar. - So the entire machinery\nof the learning process end to end is just, you just have a different set of controls? - Optimist will figure out how to do things by watching videos. - As the saying goes, \"Be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a battle,\nyou know nothing about.\" - [Elon] Yeah, it's true. - What's something difficult you're going through that\npeople don't often see? - Trying to defeat Uber Lilith? (laughing) No, I mean, you know, I mean, my mind is a storm and I don't think, I don't think most people would wanna be me. They may think they would wanna be me, but they don't know. They don't understand. - How are you doing? - I mean, overall, okay. In the grand scheme of\nthings, I can't complain. - Do you get lonely?\n- Sometimes. But I, you know, my kids and friends keep me company. - So not existential. - There are many nights I sleep alone. I don't have to, but I do. - Walter Isaacson, in his\nnew biography of you wrote about your difficult childhood. Will you ever find\nforgiveness in your heart for everything that has happened to you in that period of your life? - What is forgiveness? I do not... At least I don't think\nI have a resentment, so nothing to forgive. - You know, forgiveness\nis difficult for people. It seems like you don't\nharbor the resentment. - I mean, I try to think about like, what is gonna affect the\nfuture in a good way. And holding onto grudges does not affect the future in a good way. - You're a father, a proud father. What have you learned\nabout life from your kids? Those little biological organisms? - I mean, developing AI and watching, say little X grow is fascinating because they, they're far more parallels\nthan I would've expected. I mean, I can see his\nbiological neural net making more and more sense to the world. And I can see the digital neural net making more and more sense of\nthe world at the same time. - Do you see the beauty in magic in both? - Yes. I mean, one of the things\nwith kids is that, you know, you kind of see the\nworld anew in their eyes. You know, to them\neverything is new and fresh. And then when you see that, them experience the world is\nnew and fresh, you do too. - Well. Elon, I just wanna say thank you for your kindness to me and\nfriendship over the years. For seeing something\nin a silly kid like me, as you've done for many others. And thank you for having\nhope for a positive future, for humanity, and for working your ass\noff to make it happen. Thank you, Elon.\n- [Elon] Thanks Lex. - Thank you for listening\nto this conversation with Elon Musk. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words that Walter Isaacson wrote\nabout the central philosophy of how Elon approaches difficult problems. \"The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
