      "section": "CIA and the President",
      "text": "The Central Intelligence Agency was formed almost 75 years ago. What is the mission of\nthe CIA? How does it work? - The mission of the CIA\nis to collect intelligence from around the world that supports a national security mission and be the central repository for all other intelligence agencies. So that it's one collective source where all intelligence can be synthesized and then passed forward\nto the decision-makers. - That doesn't include\ndomestic intelligence, it's primarily looking outward\noutside the United States. - Correct, CIA is the Foreign\nIntelligence Collection. King spoke if you will. FBI does domestic and then Department of Homeland\nSecurity does domestic, law enforcement essentially\nhandles all things domestic. Intelligence is not law enforcement, so we technically cannot work\ninside the United States. - Is there clear lines\nto be drawn between, like you just said, the CIA, FBI and the other US intelligence\nagencies like the DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, Department of Homeland Security, NSA, National Security Agency. And there's a list... - There's a list of about 33 different intelligence organizations. - It's like the army, the Navy has it. All the different organizations have their own intelligence groups. So is there clear lines here to be drawn or is the CIA the giant\nintegrator of all of these? - It's a little bit of both, to be honest. So yes, there are absolutely lines. And more so than the lines,\nthere are lines that divide what our primary mission is. Everything's gotta be prioritized. That's one of the benefits\nand the superpowers of the United States, is we prioritize everything. So different intelligence\norganizations are prioritized to collect certain types of intelligence. And then within the confines\nof how they collect, they're also given unique authorities. Authorities are a term that's directed by the executive branch. Different agencies have\ndifferent authorities to execute missions in different ways. FBI can't execute the\nsame way CIA executes and CIA can't execute the\nsame way NGA executes. But then at the end, excuse\nme, when it's all collected, then yes, CIA still acts as a final synthesizing\nrepository to create what's known as the\nPresident's daily brief. The PDB, the only way\nCIA can create the PDB is by being the single source\nof all source intelligence from around the IC, the\nintelligence community, which are those 30 some odd and always changing\norganizations that are sponsored for intelligence operations. - What does the PDB, the\nPresident's Daily Brief look like? How long is it? What does it contain? - So, first of all, it looks like the most expensive book report\nyou can ever imagine. It's got its own binder.\nIt's all very high end. It feels important. It looks important. It's not like a cheap trapper keeper. It's somewhere between,\nI would give it probably between 50 and 125 pages a day. It's produced every day around\ntwo o'clock in the morning by a dedicated group of analysts. And each page is essentially\na short paragraph to a few paragraphs about\na priority happening that affects national security\nfrom around the world. The president rarely gets to\nthe entire briefing in a day. He relies on a briefer\ninstead to prioritize what inside the briefing needs to\nbe shared with the president. 'Cause some days the PDB will\nget briefed in 10 minutes and some days it'll be briefed\nover the course of two hours. It depends on the president's schedule. - How much competition is\nthere for the first page. And so how much jockeying\nthere is for attention for, I imagine for all the\ndifferent intelligence agencies and within the CIA, there's\nprobably different groups that are modular and\nthey're all care about different nations or different cases. And do you understand how much competition\nthere is for the attention for the limited attention\nof the president? - You're 100% correct in how the agency and how officers and managers\nat the agency handle the PDB. There's a ton of competition. Everybody wants to be\nthe first on the radar. Everybody wants to be on the first page. The thing that we're not\nbaking into the equation is the president's interests. The president dictates what's\non the first page of his PDB and he will tell them,\nusually the day before, I wanna see this on the\nfirst page tomorrow, bring this to me in the beginning. I don't want to hear about what's happening in Mozambique. I don't really care about what's\nhappening in Saudi Arabia. I wanna see one, two, three. And regardless of whether or not those are the three biggest things in the world, the president's the executive. He's the one, he's the ultimate customer. So we do what the customer says. That has backfired in the past, if you haven't already started seeing how that could go wrong, that\nhas backfired in the past. But that is essentially\nwhat happens when you serve in the executive branch. You serve the executive. - So what's the role,\nthe director of the CIA versus the president? What's that dance like? So the president really\nleads the focus of the CIA? - The president is the\ncommander-in-chief for the military. But the executive, the president is also the executive for the entirety of the intelligence community. So he's the ultimate customer. If you look at it like a\nbusiness, the customer, the person spending the\nmoney is the president and the director is the CEO. So if the director doesn't create what the president wants,\nthere's gonna be a new director. That's why the director of CIA is a presidential appointed position. Sometimes they're extremely qualified intelligence professionals. Sometimes they're just\nprofessional politicians or soldiers that get put into that seat because the president trusts them to do what he wants them to do. Another gaping area that causes problems. But that's still the way it is. - So you think this is a\nproblematic configuration of the whole system? - Massive flaw in the system. It is a massive flaw in the system because if you're essentially\nappointing a director to do what you want them to do,\nthen you're assigning a crony. And that's what we define corruption as within the United States. And inside the United States, we say if you pick\nsomebody outside of merit for any other reason other\nthan merit, then it's cronyism or it's nepotism. Here that's exactly what\nour structure's built on. All presidential appointees are appointed on something other than merit. - So for an intelligence\nagency to be effective, it has to discover the truth\nand communicate that truth. And maybe if you're appointing\nthe director of that agency, they're less likely to\ncommunicate the truth to you unless the truth aligns perfectly with your desired worldview. - Well, not necessarily perfectly, because there are other steps, right? They have to go in front of Congress and they have to have the support of multiple legislatures or legislators. But the challenge is that\nthe shortlist of people who even get the opportunity aren't a meritorious list. It's a short list based off of\nwho the president is picking or who the would be president is picking. Now I think we've proven that an intelligence organization\ncan be extremely effective even within the flawed system. The challenge is how much more effective\ncould we be if we improved? And I think that's the\nchallenge that faces a lot of the US government. I think that's a challenge\nthat has resulted in what we see today when\nit comes to the decline of American power and American influence, the rise of foreign influence, authoritarian powers and\na shrinking US economy. A growing Chinese economy. And it's just, we have\nquestions, hard questions we need to ask ourselves about how we're gonna handle the future. - What aspect of that\ncommunication between the president and the CIA could be fixed to help fix the problems that you're referring to in terms of the decline of American power. - So when you talk about the\npresident wanting to prioritize what the president cares\nabout, that immediately shows a break between what actually matters to the long-term success\nof the United States versus what benefits\nthe short-term success of the current president. - Because any president\nis just a human being and has a very narrow focus. And narrow focus is not\na long-term calculation. - Exactly, what's the\nmaximum amount of years a president can be president? Eight, he or she... - In the United States. - In the United States according to our current constitution. (Andrew laughing) But they're very limited in terms of what they have to prioritize. And then if you look at a four year cycle, two years of that is essentially preparing for the next election cycle. So what's only two years\nof really quality attention you get from the president, who's the chief executive of\nall the intelligence community. So the most important thing to them is not always the most important thing to the long-term survival\nof the United States. - What do you make of\nthe hostile relationship that to me at least stands\nout of the presidents between Donald Trump and the CIA? Was that a very kind of\na personal bickering? I mean, is there something\ninteresting to you about the dynamics between\nthat particular president and that particular instantiation of the intelligence agency? - Man, there were lots of\nthings fascinating to me about that relationship, so first... - What's the good and the\nbad? Sorry to interrupt. - So lemme start with the good first 'cause there's a lot of people who don't think there was any good. So the good thing is, we\nsaw that the president, who's the chief customer,\nthe executive to the CIA, when the president doesn't\nwant to hear what CIA has to say, he's not gonna listen. I think that's an important\nlesson for everyone to take home. If the president doesn't\ncare what you have to say, he's gonna take funding away,\nor she will take funding away. They're gonna take attention away. They're going to shut down your operations, your missions. They're gonna kill the careers\nof the people working there. Think about that, for the four years that President Trump was the president, basically everybody at CIA,\ntheir career was put on pause. Some people's careers were ended, some people voluntarily\nleft their career there because they found themselves\nworking for a single customer that didn't want what they had to produce. - So for people who don't know, Donald Trump did not display significant deep interest in the output. - [Andrew] He did not trust it, yeah. - He was a disinterested\ncustomer of the information. - Exactly right, and then what do disinterested customers do? They go find someone else\nto create their product. And that's exactly what Donald Trump did. And he did it through the\nprivate intelligence world, funding private intelligence companies to run their own operations that brought him the\ninformation he cared about when CIA wouldn't. It also didn't help\nthat CIA stepped outside of their confines, right? CIA is supposed to collect\nforeign intelligence and not comment on domestic matters. They went way outside of that when they started\nchallenging the president, when they started questioning\nthe results, when they started publicly claiming Russian influence. That's all something the FBI\ncould have handled by itself, the Justice Department could\nhave handled by itself. CIA had no place to contribute\nto that conversation. And when they did, all\nthey did was undermine the relationship they had\nwith their primary customer. - Let me sort of focus\nin on this relationship between the president or the leader and the intelligence agency and look outside the United States."

      "section": "War in Ukraine",
      "text": "It seems like authoritarian regimes or regimes throughout history, if you look at Stalin and\nHitler, if you look at today with Vladimir Putin, the negative effects of power corrupting the mind of a leader manifest itself is that they start to get bad information from\nthe intelligence agencies. So this kind of thing\nthat you're talking about, over time, they start hearing information they want to hear. The agency starts producing\nonly the kind of information they want to hear. And the leader's worldview\nstarts becoming distorted to where the propaganda\nthey generate is also the thing that the intelligence\nagencies provide to them. And so they start believing\ntheir own propaganda and they start getting\ndistorted view of the world. Sorry for the sort of walking\nthrough in a weird way. But I guess I want to ask, do you think, let's look at Vladimir Putin specifically. Do you think he's getting\naccurate information about the world? Do you think he knows\nthe truth of the world? Whether that's the war in Ukraine, whether that's the behavior\nof the other nations in NATO, the United States in general. What do you think? - It's rare that I'll\ntalk about just thinking, I prefer to share my assessment. Why I assess things a\ncertain way rather than just what's my random opinion. And my assessment,\nVladimir Putin is winning. Russia is winning. They're winning in Ukraine, but they're also winning\nthe battle of influence against the West. They're winning in the\nface of economic sanctions. They're winning empirically. When you look at the\nmath, they're winning. So when you ask me whether or not Putin is getting good information for his intelligence services, when I look at my overall assessment of multiple data points, he must be getting good information. Do I know how or why? I do not. I don't know how or why it works there. I don't know how such deep cronyism, such deep corruption can possibly yield true real results. And yet somehow there are\nreal results happening. So it's either excessive\nwaste and an accidental win, or there really is a system and a process there that's functioning. - So this winning idea\nis very interesting. In what way, short term and\nlong term, is Russia winning? Some people say there was a miscalculation of the way the invasion happened. There was an assumption\nthat you would be able to successfully take Kiev. You'd be able to successfully\ncapture the east, the south, and the north of Ukraine. And with what now appears to be significantly insufficient\ntroops spread way too thin across way too large of a front. So that seems to be like\nan intelligence failure. And that doesn't seem to be like winning. In another way, it\ndoesn't seem like winning if we put aside the human cost of war, it doesn't seem like\nwinning because the hearts and minds of the West were completely on the side of Ukraine. This particular leader in Vladi Zelensky captured the attention of\nthe world and the hearts and minds of Europe, the West and many other nations\nthroughout the world, both financially in terms\nof military equipment and in terms of sort\nof social and cultural and emotional support for the independence fight of this nation. That seems to be like a miscalculation. So against that pushback, why do you think there's still kernels of winning in this on the Russian side? - What you're laying out isn't incorrect and the miscalculations\nare not unexpected. Anybody who's been to a military college, including the Army War\nCollege in Pennsylvania, where so many of our military\nleaders are brought up. When you look at the conflict in Ukraine, it fits the exact mold of what an effective long-term military conflict, protracted military conflict would and should look like\nfor military dominance. Now, did Zelensky and did the\nUkrainians shock the world? Absolutely, but in that they also shocked American intelligence, which like you said, miscalculated. The whole world, miscalculated how the Ukrainians would respond. Putin did not move in there accidentally. He had an assessment. He had high likelihood\nof a certain outcome, and that outcome did not happen. Why did he have that calculation?\nBecause in 2014 it worked. He took Crimean in 14 days. He basically created an infiltration campaign that turned key leaders\nover in the first few days of the conflict. So essentially there was no conflict. It worked in 2008 when he took Georgia, nobody talks about that. He invaded Georgia the exact\nsame way. And it worked. So in 2008 it worked. In 2014, it worked. There was no reason to believe it wasn't going to work again. So he just carried out the same campaign. But this time something was different. That was a miscalculation for\nsure on the part of Putin. And the reason that there\nwas no support from the West 'cause let's not forget,\nthere is no support. There is nothing other\nthan the Lend-Lease Act, which is putting Ukraine in massive debt right now to the West. That's the only form of support\nthey're getting from NATO or the United States. So if somebody believed Ukraine would win, if somebody believed Ukraine had a chance, they would've gotten more\nmaterial support than just debt. And we can jump into\nthat anytime you want to. But the whole world miscalculated. Everybody thought Russia\nwas gonna win in 14 days. I said that they would win in 14 days 'cause that was the\npredominant calculation. Once the first invasion didn't\nwork, then the military does what professional militaries\ndo, man, they reevaluate, they reorganize leaders and then they take a new approach. You saw three approaches.\nThe first two did not work. The first two campaigns\nagainst Ukraine did not work the way they were supposed to work. The third has worked exactly\nlike it's supposed to work. You don't need Kiev to win Ukraine. You don't need hearts\nand minds to win Ukraine. - [Lev] What's the third? - Yeah, what you need is\ncontrol of natural resources, which they're taking in the East. And you need access to the heartbeat, the blood flow of food and\nmoney into the country, which they're taking in the South. The fact that Ukraine had to\ngo to the negotiation table with Russia and Turkey\nin order to get exports out of the Black Sea, approved\nagain, demonstrates just how much Ukraine is losing. The aggressor had a seat\nat the negotiation table to allow Ukraine the ability to even export one of its top exports. If Russia would've said no, then they would not have had that. That's like someone holding your throat. It's like somebody\nholding your jugular vein and saying, \"If you don't\ndo what I tell you to do, then I'm not gonna let you breathe. I'm not gonna let blood\nflow to your brain.\" - So do you think it's\npossible that Russia takes the south of Ukraine? So starting from Mariupol,\nthe Haisyn region, - All the way to Odessa. - [Lex] All the way to Odessa - And into Moldova. I believe all of that will\nhappen before the fall. - Fall of this year?\n- Fall of this year. Before winter hits Europe, NATO wants, Germany needs to be able to have sanctions lifted so\nthey can tap into Russian power. There's no way they can\nhave those sanctions lifted unless Russia wins. And Russia also knows that all of Europe, all of NATO is the true people\nfeeling the pain of the war outside of Ukraine are the NATO countries because they're so\nheavily reliant on Russia. And as they have supported\nAmerican sanctions against Russia, their people feel\nthe pain economically, their people feel the pain. What are they gonna do in the winter? Because without Russian gas, their people are gonna freeze to death. - [Lex] Ukrainian people?\n- People all over NATO. Ukraine, everybody knows\nUkrainians at risk. Everybody knows Ukrainians are dying. The game of war isn't even played majoratively by the people who are fighting. The game of war is\nplayed by everyone else. It's an economic game.\nIt's not a military game. - [Lex] The flow of\nresources and energy, food - Attention, exactly right. - I was on the front in the\nHaisyn region, this very area that you're referring to, and\nI spoke to a lot of people and the morale is incredibly high. And I don't think the\npeople in that region, soldiers, volunteer soldiers, civilians, are going to give up\nthat land without dying. - I agree with you. - I mean, in order to take Odessa would require huge amount of artillery and slaughter of civilians, essentially. - They're not gonna\nuse artillery in Odessa because Odessa is too\nimportant to Russian culture. It's gonna be even uglier than that. It's going to be clearing of\nstreets, clearing of buildings, person by person, troop by troop. It'll be a lot like\nwhat it was in Mariupol. - [Lex] Just shooting at civilians. - Because they can't afford\nto just do bombing raids because they're gonna\ndestroy cultural significant architecture that's just too important to the Russian culture. And that's gonna demoralize\ntheir own Russian people. - I have to do a lot of\nthinking to try to understand what I even feel, I don't know. But in terms of information, the thing that the soldiers are saying, the Russian soldiers are saying, the thing the Russian\nsoldiers really believe is that they're freeing, they're liberating the\nUkrainian people from Nazis. And they believe this because I visited Ukrainian,\nI spoke to the over a hundred, probably a couple hundred Ukrainian people from different walks of life. It feels like the\nRussian soldiers at least aren't under a cloud of propaganda. They're not operating on a\nclear view of the whole world. And given all that, I just don't see Russia taking the south without committing war crimes. And if Vladimir Putin is\naware of what's happening in terms of the treatment of civilians, I don't see him pushing\nforward all the way to take the south, because that's not going\nto be effective strategy for him to win the hearts\nand minds of his people. - Autocracies don't need\nto win hearts and minds. That's a staunchly\ndemocratic point of view. Hearts and minds mean\nvery little to people who understand core basic needs and true power. You don't see Xi Jinping worrying about hearts and minds in China. You don't see it in North Korea, you don't see it in Congo, you don't see it in most of the world. Hearts and minds are a luxury. In reality, what people\nneed is food, water, power. They need income to be\nable to secure a lifestyle. It is absolutely sad. I am not in any way, shape or form saying that my assessment on this is enriching or enlightening or hopeful. It's just fact. It's just calculatable empirical evidence. If Putin loses in Ukraine, the losses, the influential losses, the\neconomic losses, the lives lost, the power lost is too great. So it is better for him to push and push and push through war crimes,\nthrough everything else. War crimes are something defined by the International Court system. The International Court system has Russia as part of its board. And the international court\nsystem is largely powerless when it comes to enforcing\nits own outcomes. So the real risk gain\nscenario here for Russia is significantly in\nfavor of gain over risk. The other thing that I think is important to talk about is everybody\nis trapped in the middle of a gigantic information war. Yes, there's battlefield\nbullets and cannons and tanks, but there's also a\nmassive informational war. The same narrative that you see these\nground troops in Ukraine, these Russian ground\ntroops in Ukraine believing they're clearing the land of Nazis. That information is being fed to them from their own home country. I don't know why people seem\nto think that the information that they're reading in English\nis any more or less true. Every piece of news coming outta the West, every piece of information coming out in the English language\nis also a giant narrative being shared intentionally to\ntry to undermine the morale and the faithfulness of\nEnglish speaking Russians, which somebody somewhere knows exactly how many of those there are. So we have to recognize that we're not getting true\ninformation from other side because there is a strategic\nvalue in making sure that there is just the\nright amount of miss or disinformation out there. Not because someone's\ntrying to lie to Americans, but because someone is trying to influence the way English\nspeaking Russians think. And in that world, that's\nexactly why you see so many news articles\ncited to anonymous sources, government officials who\ndo not wanna be named. There's nothing that links back\nresponsibility there, right? There's nothing that\ncan go to court there. But the information still gets released and that's enough to\nmake Ukrainians believe that the United States is gonna help them, or that the West is gonna help them. It's enough to make Russians think that they're going to lose. And maybe they should just give up now and leave from the battlefield now. We have to understand we are in the middle of a giant information war. - Maybe you can correct me, but it feels like in the\nEnglish speaking world, it's harder to control,\nit's harder to fight the information war because of, you know, some people say there's not\nreally a freedom of speech in this country. But I think if you compare, there's a lot more freedom of speech and it's just harder to control narratives when there's a bunch of gorilla\njournalists that are able to just publish anything they\nwant on Twitter or anything. It's just harder to control narratives. - So people don't understand\nwhere freedom of speech is. That's the first major problem. And it's shameful how many people in the United\nStates do not understand what freedom of speech actually protects. So that aside, you're absolutely right. Fighting the information\nwar in the West is extremely difficult because anyone with a blog, anyone with a Twitter account, I mean, anyone can call themselves\na journalist essentially. We live in a world, we live in a country where people read the headline and they completely bypass the author line and they go straight into the content and then they decide whether\nthe content's real or not, based on how they feel instead of based on empirical,\nmeasurable evidence. - So you mentioned the Lend-Lease Act and the support of the United States, support of Ukraine by the United States. Are you skeptical to the level of support that the United States is providing and is going to provide over time? - The strategy that the\nUnited States has taken to support Ukraine is similar\nto the strategy we took to support Great Britain\nduring World War II. The enactment of the Lend-Lease Act is a perfect example of that. The Lend-Lease Act means\nthat we are lending or leasing equipment to\nthe Ukrainian government in exchange for future payment. So every time a rocket is launched, every time a drone crashes into a tank, that's a bill that Ukraine\nis just racking up. It's like when you go to a restaurant and you start drinking shots, sometime the bill will come due. This is exactly what we did when Europe and when Great Britain was\nin the face of Nazi invasion. We signed the same thing into motion. Do you know that the UK\ndid not pay off the debt from World War II until 2020. They've been paying that debt\nsince the end of World War II. So what we're doing is\nwe're indebting Ukraine against the promise that perhaps they will\nsecure their freedom, which nobody seems to want to talk about what freedom is actually gonna look like for Ukrainians, right? What are the true handful of outcomes, the realistic outcomes\nthat could come of this, and which of those outcomes really looks like freedom to them, especially\nin the face of the fact that they're going to be\ntrillions of dollars in debt to the West for supplying\nthem with the training and the weapons and the\nfood and the med kits and everything else\nthat we're giving them. Because none of it's\nfree. It's all coming due. We're a democracy, but we're\nalso a capitalist country. We can't afford to just\ngive things away for free, but we can give things away at a discount. We can give things away layaway, but the bill will come due. And unfortunately, that is\nnot part of the conversation that's being had with the American people. - So debt is a way to establish\nsome level of control. - Power\n- Is power. That said, having a\nvery close relationship between Ukraine and the United\nStates does not seem to be a negative possibility\nwhen Ukrainians think about their future in terms of freedom. That's one thing. And the other, there's\nsome aspect of this war that I've just noticed that one of the people I talked to\nsaid that, \"All great nations have a independence\nwar\", have to have a war for their independence. There's something, it's dark, but there's something about\nwar just being a catalyst for finding your own identity as a nation. So you can have leaders,\nyou can have sort of signed documents, you can\nhave all this kind of stuff, but there's something about war that really brings the country together and actually try to figure\nout what is at the core of the spirit of the people\nthat defines this country. And they see this war as\nthat, as the independence war to define the heart of\nwhat the country is. So there's been, before the\nwar, before this invasion, there was a lot of\nfactions in the country. There was a lot of\ninfluence from oligarchs and corruption and so on. A lot of that was the\nfactions were brought together under one umbrella effectively\nto become one nation because of this invasion. So they see that as a positive direction for the defining of what a free democratic country looks like after the war, in their perspective, after the war is won. - It's a difficult situation because I'm trying to make sure that you and all everybody\nlistening understands that what's happening in Ukraine\namong Ukrainians is noble and brave and courageous and beyond the expectations of anyone. The fact is, there is no material support\ncoming from the outside. In the American Revolution was won because of French involvement. French ships, French\ntroops, French generals, French military might. The independence of communist China was won through Russian support. Russian generals, Russian\ntroops on the ground fighting with the communists. That's how revolutions are won. That's how independent countries are born. Ukraine doesn't get any of that there. No one is stepping into that because we live in a world right now where there simply is no economic benefits to the parties in power to\nsupport Ukraine to that level. And war is a game of economics. The economic benefit of Ukraine\nis crystal clear in favor of Russia, which is why Putin cannot lose. He will not let himself lose. Short of something\ncompletely unexpected, right? I'm talking 60%, 70%\nprobability Ukraine loses, but there's still 20%, 30% probability of the unimaginable happening. Who knows what that might be. And oligarch assassinates Putin or a nuclear bomb goes off somewhere or who knows what, right? There's still a chance that\nsomething unexpected will happen and change the tide of the war. But when it comes down to\nthe core calculus here, Ukraine is the agricultural\nbed to support a future Russia. Russia knows, they know\nthey have to have Ukraine. They know that they have to have it to protect themselves against military pressure from the West. They have to have it for\nagricultural reasons. They have major oil on\nnatural gas pipelines that flow through Eastern Ukraine. They cannot let Ukraine fall outside of their sphere of influence, they cannot. The United States doesn't\nreally have any economic vested interest in Ukraine. You know, ideological points\nof view and promises aside, there's no economic benefit. And the same thing goes for NATO. NATO has no economic\ninvestments in Ukraine. Ukrainian output, Ukrainian food goes to the Middle East and Africa. It doesn't go to Europe. So the whole, the West siding with Ukraine is exclusively ideological and it's putting them in a place where they fight a war with Russia so the whole world can\nsee Russia's capabilities. Ukraine is a, as sad as it is to say, man, Ukraine is a pawn on a\ntable for superpowers to calculate each other's capacities. Right now we've only talked about Russia and the United States. We haven't even talked about Iran. We haven't even talked about China, right? It is a pawn on a table. This is a chicken fight so\nthat people get to watch and see what the other trainers are doing. - Well, a lot of people might\nhave said the same thing about the United States back\nin the independence fight. So there is possibilities, as you've said. We're not saying 0% chance, and it could be a reasonably\nhigh percent chance that this becomes one of\nthe great democratic nations that the 21st century is remembered by. - [Andrew] Absolutely.\n- And so you said American support, so\nideologically, first of all, you don't assign much\nlong-term power to that, that US could support Ukraine purely on ideological grounds. - Just look in the last four\nyears, the last three years, do you remember what happened in Hong Kong right before Covid? China swooped into Hong Kong\nviolently beating protesters, killing them in the street, imprisoning people without just cause. And Hong Kong was a democracy and the whole world stood\nby and let it happen. And then what happened in\nAfghanistan just a year ago? And the whole world stood by and let the Taliban take power\nagain after 20 years of loss. We are showing a repeatable point of view. We will talk American politicians,\nAmerican administrations, we will say a lot of things. We will promise a lot of\nideological pro-democracy, rah rah statements, we will say it. But when it comes down to\nputting our own people, our own economy, our own GDP at risk, we step away from that fight. - America is currently supplying military equipment to Ukraine.\n- [Andrew] Absolutely. - And a lot of that military equipment has actually been the thing\nthat turned the tides of war a couple of times already. Currently that's the HIMARS systems. So you mentioned sort of\nPutin can't afford to lose, but winning can look in different ways. So you've kind of defined\nso on, at this moment, the prediction is that winning\nlooks like capturing not just the east but the south of Ukraine, but you can have narratives\nof winning that returned back to the, what was it? The beginning of this\nyear before the invasion? That Crimea is still with Russia. There's some kind of\nnegotiated thing about Donbas where it still stays with the Ukraine, but it there's some...\n- Public government. Just like what they have\nin Georgia right now. - And that could still be\ndefined through mechanisms... - [Andrew] As Russia winning. - As Russia winning for Russia and then for Ukraine as Ukraine winning and for the West as democracy winning. And you kind of negotiate. I mean that seems to be\nhow geopolitics works, everybody can walk away\nwith a win-win story, and then the world progresses,\nwith lessons learned. - That's the high likely, that's\nthe most probable outcome. The most probable outcome\nis that Ukraine remains in air quotes, \"a sovereign nation\". It's not going to be truly sovereign because it will become, it will have to have new\ngovernment put in place. Zelensky will, it's extremely\nunlikely he will be president because he has gone too far to demonstrate his power over the people and his ability to separate\nthe Ukrainian people from the autocratic power of Russia. So he would have to be unseated. Whether he goes into exile or whether he is peacefully\nleft alone is all gonna be part of the negotiations. But the thing to keep in mind also is that a negotiated piece really just means a negotiated ceasefire. And we've seen this\nhappen all over the world. North Korea and South\nKorea are technically still just in negotiated cease fire. What you end up having is\nRussia will allow Ukraine to call itself Ukraine,\nto operate independently, to have their own debt\nto the United States. Russia doesn't wanna take on that debt. And then in exchange for that, they will have firmer guidelines as to how NATO can engage with Ukraine. And then that becomes an example for all the other former\nSoviet satellite states, which are all required\neconomically by Russia, not required economically by the West. And then you can see how the whole thing plays\nout once you realize that the keystone is Ukraine. - There is something about\nUkraine, the deep support by the Ukrainian people of\nAmerica that is in contrast with, for example, Afghanistan, that it seems like\nideologically Ukraine could be a beacon of freedom used in\nnarratives by the United States to fight geopolitical wars\nin that part of the world. That they would be a good\npartner for this idea of democracy, of freedom,\nof all the values that America stands for. They're a good partner and so it's valuable if\nyou sort of have a cynical, pragmatic view, sort of like\nHenry Kissinger type of view. It's valuable to have them\nas a partner, so valuable that it makes sense to\nsupport them in achieving a negotiated ceasefire that's\non the side of Ukraine. But because of this particular leader, this particular culture,\nthis particular dynamics of how the war unrolled\nand things like Twitter and the way digital\ncommunication currently works, it just seems like this is\na powerful symbol of freedom that's useful for the United States, if we're sort of to\ntake the pragmatic view. Don't you think it's possible that United States supports\nUkraine financially, militarily enough for it to\nget an advantage in this war? - I think they've already\ngot an advantage in the war. The fact that the war is\nstill going on demonstrates the asymmetrical advantage. The fact that Russia has stepped\nup to the negotiating table with them several times\nwithout just turning to, I mean, you remember what\nhappened in Chechnya, without turning to Chechnya level, just mass blind destruction,\nwhich was another Putin war. To see that those things\nhave happened demonstrates the asymmetric advantage\nthat the West has given. I think the true way to look\nat the benefit of Ukraine as a shining example of\nfreedom in Europe for the West isn't to understand\nwhether or not they could, they absolutely could. It's the question of how\nvaluable is that in Europe, how valuable is Ukraine? Which before February, nobody\neven thought about Ukraine. And the people who did\nknow about Ukraine knew that it was a extremely\ncorrupt, former Soviet state with 20% of its national population, self-identifying as Russian. There's a reason Putin went into Ukraine. There's a reason he's\nbeen promising he would go into Ukraine for the\nbetter part of a decade because the circumstances were aligned. It was a corrupt country\nthat self-identified as Russian in many ways. It was supposed to be an\neasier of multiple marks in terms of the former Soviet\nsatellite states to go after. That's all part of the miscalculation that the rest of the world saw too, when we thought it would fall quickly. So to think that it could be\na shining example of freedom is accurate, but is it as\nshining a star as Germany? Is it as shining a star as the UK? Is it as shining a star as Romania? Is it as shiny a star as France? Like it's got a lot of democratic freedom based countries in Europe\nto compete against, to be the shining stellar example. And in exchange on counterpoint to that, it has an extreme amount of\nstrategic value to Russia, which has no interest in\nmaking it a shining star of the example of democracy and freedom. - Outside of resource, in terms of the shininess of\nthe star, I would argue yes. If you look at how much it captivated the attention of the world. - The attention of the world has made no material difference, man,\nthat's what I'm saying. - That's your estimation, but are you sure we can't... If you can convert that\ninto political influence, into money, don't you\nthink attention is money? - Attention is money in democracies and capitalist countries, yes. - Which serves as a counterweight to sort of authoritarian regimes. So for Putin resources matter, for the United States\nalso resources matter, but the attention and the\nbelief of the people also matter because that's how you attain\nand maintain political power. - So going to that exact\nexample, then I would highlight that our current\nadministration has the lowest approval ratings of president in history. So if people were very fond of\nthe war going on in Ukraine, wouldn't that counterbalance\nsome of our upset, some of the dissent\ncoming from the economy and some of the dissent coming\nfrom the Great Recession or the great resignation and whatever's happening\nwith the down stock market, you would think that people would feel like they're\nsacrificing for something. If they really believed\nthat Ukraine mattered, that they would stand\nnext to the president who is so staunchly driving and leading the West\nagainst this conflict? - Well, I think the opposition\nto this particular president, I personally believe has\nless to do with the policies and more to do with a lot\nof the other human factors. - But again, empirically\nthis is, I look at things through a very empirical lens, a very cold fact-based lens. And there are multiple\ndata points that suggest that the American people\nideologically sympathize with Ukraine, but they really just want their gas prices to go down. They really just want to be able to pay less money at the\ngrocery store for their food. And they most definitely\ndon't want their sons and daughters to die in\nexchange for Ukrainian freedom. - It does hurt me to see the politicization of this war as well. I think that's maybe has to do\nwith the kind of calculation you're referring to, but it seems like it doesn't. It seems like there's a cynical\nwhatever takes attention of the media for the moment. The the red team chooses one side and the blue team chooses another. And then I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the Democrats\nwent into full like support of Ukraine on the idealogical side. And then I guess republicans are saying, \"Why are we wasting money? The gas prices are growing up.\" That's a very crude kind of analysis, but they basically\npicked whatever argument on whatever side. And now more and more and more, this particular war in Ukraine is becoming a kind of pawn in the game of politics. That's first the midterm\nelections then building up towards the presidential elections and stops being about the\nphilosophical, the social, the geopolitical aspects,\nparameters of this war and more about just like\nwhatever the heck captivates Twitter, and we're gonna\nuse that for politics. - You're right in the sense\nof the fact that it's, I wouldn't say that the red team and the blue team picked\nopposite sides on this. What I would say is that media discovered that talking about Ukraine\nwasn't as profitable as talking about something else. People simply, the American\npeople who read media or who watch media, they simply became\nbored reading about news that didn't seem to be changing much. And we turned back into wanting to read about our own economy and we wanted to hear\nmore about cryptocurrency, and we wanted to hear more\nabout the Kardashians. And that's what we care about. So that's what media writes about. That's how a capitalist\nmarket-driven world works, and that's how the United States works. That's why in both red papers\nand blue papers, red sources and blue sources, you don't see Ukraine being mentioned very much. If anything, I would say that your Republicans are\nprobably more in support of what's happening in Ukraine right now because we're creating\nnew weapons systems, our military is getting stronger, we get to test military systems in combat in Ukraine, that's priceless. In the world of the\nmilitary industrial complex, being able to field test,\ncombat test a weapon without having to\nsacrifice your own people is incredibly valuable. You get all the data, you get\nall the performance metrics, but you don't have to\nput yourself at risk. That is one of the major benefits of what we're seeing from supporting Ukraine with weapons and with troops. The long-term benefit to\nwhat will come of this for the United States,\npractically speaking in the lens of national security\nthrough military readiness, through future economic\nbenefits, those are super strong. The geopolitical fight is essentially moot because Ukraine is not\na geopolitical player. It was not for 70 years. And after this conflict is\nover, it will not again. Just think about what\nyou were just saying, with the American people's\nattention span to Twitter and whatever's currently going on. If the Ukraine conflict\nresolved itself today in any direction, how\nmany weeks do you think before no one talked\nabout Ukraine anymore? Do you think we would make it two weeks or do you think we'd\nmake it maybe seven days? It would be headline\nnews for one or two days and then we'd be onto something else. It's just an unfortunate reality of how the world works in\na capitalist democracy. - Yeah, it just breaks my\nheart how much, you know, I know that there's Yemen and Syria and... - That nobody talks about anymore. Still raging conflicts going on. - It just breaks my heart how much generational hatred is born. I happen to be from, my\nfamily is from Ukraine and from Russia. And so for me, just personally,\nit's a part of the world I care about in terms of its history. Because I speak the language,\nI can appreciate the beauty of the literature, the music, the art, the cultural history of the 20th century through all the dark times,\nthrough all the hell of the dark sides of authoritarian regimes, the destruction of war, there is still just the beauty\nthat I'm able to appreciate that I can't appreciate about\nChina, Brazil, other countries because I don't speak their language. This one I can appreciate. And so in that way, this is\npersonally really painful to me to see so much of that history. The beauty in that history,\nsuffocated by the hatred that is born through this\nkind of geopolitical game, fought mostly by the\npoliticians, the leaders. - People are beautiful. And that's what you're talking about. People are beautiful creatures. Culture and art and science, like these are beautiful, beautiful things that come about because of human beings. And the thing that gives me hope is that no matter what conflict\nthe world has seen, and we've seen some devastating, horrible crimes against humanity already. We saw nuclear bombs go off in Japan. We saw genocide happen in Rwanda. We've seen horrible things\nhappen, but people persevere. Language, culture, arts,\nscience, they all persevere. They all shine through. People don't even realize how gorgeous the architecture and the culture is inside Iran. People have no idea. Chinese people in the rural parts of China are some of the kindest, most amazing people you'll ever meet. And Korean arts and Korean\ndance, Korean drumming, I know nobody has ever even\nheard of Korean drumming. Korean drumming is this\nmagical, beautiful thing. And the north, in North\nKorea does it better than anybody in the world. Taekwondo in North Korea is just exceptional to watch.\n- [Lex] in North Korea? In North Korea. Nobody knows these things. - How do you know about\nTaekwondo in North Korea? I have questions.\n(both laughing) That's fascinating, like,\npeople don't think about that, but the culture, the beauty of the people still flourishes even in\nthe toughest of places. - Absolutely and we always will. We always will because\nthat is what people do. And that is just the truth of it. And it breaks my heart to see travesties that people commit against people. But whether you're\nlooking at a micro level, like what happens with shootings\nhere in the United States, or whether you look at a macro level like geopolitical power exchanges and intra and interstate conflicts like what you see in Syria and what you see in Ukraine, those are disgusting, terrible things. \"War is a terrible thing.\" That is a famous quote, but people will persevere. People will come through. - I hope so. I hope so. And I hope we don't do something that I'll probably also ask\nyou about later on is things that destroy the\npossibility of perseverance, which is things like nuclear war, things that can do such tremendous damage that we will never recover. But yeah, amidst your pragmatic pessimism, (Andrew laughing) I think both you and\nI have a kind of maybe small flame of optimism in\nthere about the perseverance of the human species in general."

      "section": "Most powerful intelligence agencies",
      "text": "Let me ask you about intelligence agencies outside of the CIA. Can you illuminate what is the most powerful\nintelligence agency in the world? The CIA, the FSB, formerly\nthe KGB, the MI6, Mossad. I've gotten a chance to\ninteract with a lot of Israelis while in Ukraine. Just incredible people in terms\nof both training and skills. Just all and every front. American soldiers too. Just American military is incredible. The competence and skill of the\nmilitary, the United States, Israeli, got to interact,\nand Ukrainian as well. - [Andrew] It's striking.\n- It's striking. It's beautiful, I just love\npeople, I love carpenters or people that are just\nextremely good at their job and they take pride in\ntheir craftsmanship. It's beautiful to see. And I imagine the same kind\nof thing happens inside of intelligence agencies\nas well that we don't get to appreciate because of the secrecy. Same thing with like Lockheed\nMartin, I interviewed the CTO of Lockheed Martin. It breaks my heart as a\nperson who loves engineering because of the cover of secrecy, we'll never get to know some\nof the incredible engineering that happens inside of\nLockheed Martin and Boeing... - [Andrew] Raytheon. - You know, there's kind of\nthis idea that these are, you know, people have conspiracy theories and they're kind of assign evil to these companies to some part. But I think there's beautiful\npeople inside those companies, brilliant people and\nsome incredible science and engineering is happening there. Anyway, that said the CIA, the FSB, the MI6, Mossad, China, I\nknow very little about the... - MSS Ministry of State Security. - I don't know how much you know, (both laughing) or just other intelligence\nagencies in India, Pakistan, I've also heard... - Yep, RAW is powerful.\nAnd so is ISS or ISSI. - And then of course European\nnations in Germany and France. Yeah, so what can you say about\nthe power of the influence of the different intelligence agencies within their nation and outside? - Yeah, so to answer your\nquestion, your original question, which is the most powerful, I'm gonna have to give you a few different answers. So the most powerful intelligence\norganization in the world in terms of reach is the Chinese MSS, the Ministry of State Security\nbecause they have created a single solitary intelligence\nservice that has global reach and is integrated with Chinese culture. So that essentially every Chinese person anywhere in the world is\nan informant to the MSS because that's their way of serving the middle kingdom jungle,\nthe central kingdom, the Chinese word for China. So they're the strongest, the most intelligence\nservice in terms of reach, most assets, most informants,\nmost intelligence. - So it is deeply\nintegrated with a citizenry? - Correct, with their culture. You know what, a Chinese person who lives in Syria thinks of themself as? A Chinese person. Do you know what a Chinese person, a Chinese national living\nin the United States thinks of themself as? A Chinese person, right? Americans living abroad often\nthink of ourselves as expats, expatriates, living on the local economy, embracing the local culture. That is not how Chinese people view traveling around the world. - And by the way, if I\nmay mention, I believe the way Mossad operates\nis similar kind of thing because people from Israel\nliving abroad still think of themselves as Jewish and Israeli first. So that allows you to integrate the... - Culture and yep, the faith-based\naspects. Exactly right. But the number of people in\nIsrael is much, much smaller than the number of people in China. - So when it comes to\nreach China wins that game. When it comes to professional\ncapability, it's the CIA by far because budget\nwise, capability wise, weapons system wise,\nmodern technology wise, CIA is the leader around the world, which is why every other\nintelligence organization out there wants to partner with CIA. They want to learn from CIA,\nthey want to train with CIA, they wanna partner on counter-narcotics and counter-drug and counter-terrorism and counter-Uyghur, you name it. People wanna partner with CIA. So CIA is the most powerful in terms of capability and wealth. And then you've got the\nidea, you've got tech. So tech alone, meaning\ncorporate espionage, economic espionage, nothing\nbeats DGSE in France, they're the top. They've got a massive budget\nthat almost goes exclusively to stealing foreign secrets. They're the biggest threat\nto the United States, even above Russia and above China. DGSE in France is a massively powerful intelligence organization, but they're so exclusively focused\non a handful of types of intelligence collection\nthat nobody even really thinks that they exist. And then in terms of\njust terrifying violence, you have Mossad. Mossad will do anything. Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes to ensure the survival of every Israeli citizen around the world. Most other countries\nwill stop at some point, but Mossad doesn't do that. - So it's the lines\nyou're willing to cross? - And the reasons that\nyou're willing to cross them. You know, the CIA will let\nan Americans stay in jail in Russia unlawfully and\nseek a diplomatic solution. I mean, the United States has let people, there are two gentlemen in from the 1950s who were imprisoned in China for 20 years waiting for diplomatic\nsolutions to their release. We do not kill to save a citizen. But Mossad will. - And then they'll not just kill, they'll like do large scale infiltration. - They do amazing things. They spare no expense because it's a demonstration\nto their own people. Again, going back to the\nwhole idea of influence, every intelligence operation\nthat sees the light of day has two purposes. The first purpose is the\nintelligence operation, but if it was just the\nintelligence operation, it would stay secret forever. The second purpose of every successful\nintelligence operation, when they become public, it's\nto send a signal to the world. If you work against us,\nwe will do this to you. If you work for us, we will\ntake care of you in this way. It's a massive information campaign. - Do you think in that way,\nCIA is not doing a good job? Because there's, you know, the\nFSB perhaps much less so GRU but the KGB did this well, which is to send a signal,\nlike basically communicate that this is a terrifying\norganization with a lot of power and Mossad is doing a good job of that. So this the psychological\ninformation warfare,"

      "section": "David Petraeus",
      "text": "and it seems like the CIA also has a lot of kind of myths about it, conspiracy theories about it, but much less so than the other agencies. - CIA does a good job of\nplaying to the mythos. So when General Petraeus used to be the director of CIA, 2000... - And your workout\npartner, I read about this. - [Andrew] And workout partner. - So I loved and hated\nthose workouts with Petraeus because he is a physical beast. He's a strong, fit at the time, 60 something year old man. - Let me take a tangent on that 'cause he's coming on this podcast. - Oh, excellent man.\n- So can you say what you've learned from\nthe man in terms of, or like what you think is\ninteresting and powerful and inspiring about the\nway he sees the world, or maybe what you learned\nin terms of how to get strong in the gym, or anything about life? - Two things right away. And one of 'em I was gonna\nshare with you anyway, so I'm glad that you asked the question. So the first is that on our runs, and man, he runs fast, and we would go for six\nmile runs through Bangkok. And he talked openly about, I asked him, \"How do you keep this mystery, this epic mythology about your fitness and your strength? How do you keep all of this\nalive with the troops?\" And he had this amazing answer and he was like, \"I don't talk about it.\" Myths are born not from\nsomebody orchestrating the myth, but from the source of the\nmyth, simply being secretive. So he's like, \"I don't talk\nabout it. I've never about it. I've never exacerbated it. I just do what I do and\nI let the troops talk.\" And he's like, \"When it\ngoes in favor of discipline and loyalty and commitment, I let it run. If it starts getting\ndestructive or damaging, then I have my leadership\nteam step into fix it.\" But when it comes to the mythos, the myth of him being\nsuperpowered soldier, that's what he wants every soldier to be. So he lets it run. And it was so enlightening\nwhen he told me, \"When there's a myth that\nbenefits you, you just let it go.\" You let it happen because\nit gets you further without you doing any work. It costs no investment for me. - So the catalyst of\nthe virality of the myth is just being mysterious. - And that's what CIA does well. To go back to your first\nquestion, what does CIA do? They don't answer any questions.\nThey don't say anything. And wherever the myth goes, the myth goes, whether it's that they sold\ndrugs or use child prostitutes or whatever else, wherever\nthe myth goes, they let it go. Because at the end of the\nday, everybody sits back and says, \"Wow, I really just don't know.\" Now the second thing that\nI learned from Petraeus, and I really am a big fan of Petraeus. I know he made personal mistakes. You don't get to be that powerful without making personal mistakes. But when I worked out with him, the one thing that my\ncommanding officer told me not to ask about, he was like, \"Never ask the general about his family.\" I'm a family guy. So as soon as I met General Petraeus, one of the first things I asked him was, \"Hey, what was it like raising a family and being the commander of\nforces in the Middle East? Like you weren't with\nyour family very much.\" And the thing I love about the guy, he didn't bite off my head. He didn't snap at me.\nHe didn't do anything. He openly admitted that he\nregretted some of the decisions that he made because he had to sacrifice his family to get there. Relationships with his children, absentee father, missing birthdays. We all say how sad it's to miss birthdays and miss anniversaries, yada, yada, yada. Everybody knows what that feels like. Even business people know\nwhat that feels like. The actual pain that we're talking about\nis when you're not there to handle your 13 year old's questions, when a boy breaks up with\nher or when you're not there to handle the bloody lip that\nyour 9-year-old comes back with from their first\nencounter with a bully. Those are the truly heartbreaking moments that a parent lives and dies by. He missed almost all of those because he was fighting\na war that we forgot and we gave up on 20 years later, right? He's so honest about that. And it was really inspiring to me to be told not to ask that question. And when I broke that guidance,\nhe didn't reprimand me. He was authentic. And it was absolutely\none of the big decisions that helped me leave\nCIA on my own in 2014. - And he was honest on\nthe sacrifice you make. - The same man who just taught me a lesson about letting a myth live. That same guy was willing to be so authentic about this personal mistake. - I like complicated people like that. (Andrew laughing) So what do you make of that calculation, of family versus job? You've given a lot of your life and passion to the CIA to that work. You spoken positively about that world the good it does. And yet you are also a family\nman and you value that. What's that calculation like? What's that trade off like? - I mean, for me the calculation\nis very clear. It's family. I left CIA because I chose my family. And when my son was born,\nmy wife and I found out that we were pregnant while\nwe were still on mission. We were a tandem couple. My wife is also a former CIA\nofficer undercover like me. We were operating together overseas. We got the positive pregnancy\ntests like so many people do. And she cried. My wife was a badass. I was like the accidental spy, but my wife was really\ngood at what she does. And she cried and she was\nlike, \"What do we do now?\" Like, it's what we've\nalways wanted, a child, but we're in this thing right now and like, there's no space for a child. So long story short, we had our baby, CIA brought us back to have the baby. And when we started having\nthe conversations about, \"Hey, what do we do next?\" 'Cause we're not the type of people to want to just sit\naround and be domestic. What do we do next? But keep in mind we have a child now, so here's some of our suggestions. We could do this and we can do that. Let us get our child to a place where we can put him into\nan international school. Or we can get him into\nsome sort of program where we can both operate together\nagain during the day. But CIA, they had no patience\nfor that conversation. There, family is not their priority. So the fact that we were a\ntandem couple, two officers, two operators trying to have\na baby was irrelevant to them. So when they didn't play with\nus, when they did nothing to help us prioritize parenthood as part of our overall experience, that's when we knew that they never would. And what good is it to commit yourself to a career if the career is always going to challenge the thing\nthat you value most? And that was the calculation\nthat we made to leave CIA. Not everybody makes that calculation. And a big part of why I am so\nvocal about my time at CIA is because I am immensely\nappreciative of the men and women who to this day have failed marriages and poor relationships with their children because they chose national security, they chose protecting\nover their own family. And they've done it even though\nit's made them a, you know, abuse alcohol and abuse substances and they've got permanent\npermanent diseases and issues from living and working abroad. It's just insane the\nsacrifice that officers make to keep America free. And I'm just not one of\nthose people. I chose family. - You said that your wife\nmisses it. Do you miss it? - We both miss it. We miss\nit for different reasons. We miss it for similar reasons, I guess, but we miss it in different ways. The people at CIA a are just amazing. They're everyday people like\nthe guy and the gal next door, but so smart and so dedicated and so courageous about what\nthey do and how they do it. I mean, the sacrifices\nthey make are massive, more massive than the sacrifices I made. So I was always inspired and impressed by the people around me. So both my wife and I\nabsolutely miss the people. My wife misses the work\nbecause you know everything. When you're inside, it's all,\nI mean, we had top secret, we had TSSCI clearances at the time. I had a CAT 6, CAT 12, which\nmakes me nuclear cleared. My wife had other privy\nclearances that allowed her to look into, you know,\nareas that were specialized. But there wasn't a headline that went out that we couldn't fact check\nwith a click of a few buttons. And she misses that 'cause\nshe loved that kind of... - And now you're just one of\nus living in the, you know, the cloud of mystery.\n- [Andrew] Exactly. Not really knowing anything\nabout what's going on. - Exactly, but for me,\nI've always been the person that likes operating. And you know what you still\nget to do when you leave CIA, you still get to operate. Operating is just working with people. It's understanding how people think, predicting their actions,\ndriving their direction of their thoughts, persuading\nthem, winning negotiations. You still get to do that.\nYou do that every day. - And you go apply that\nin all kinds of domains."

I was an Air Force Academy\ngraduate, not by choice, but by lack of opportunity, lack of lack of options otherwise. So I forced myself through\nthe academy, barely graduated with a 2.4 GPA and then went on the Air\nForce, taught me how to fly. And then the Air Force taught\nme about nuclear weapons. And I ended up as a nuclear\nmissile commander in Montana. And I chose to leave the Air Force because I didn't like shaving my face. I didn't like having short hair and I most definitely didn't\nlike shining my shoes. And I did not want to be one of the people in charge of nuclear weapons. So when I found myself\nas a person in charge of 200 nuclear weapons, I knew that I was going\ndown the wrong road. - I have questions about this and more importantly, I have questions about your hair, so you\nhad short hair at the time? - Yeah, you have to, Military regulations, you can't have hair longer than one inch. - Okay, and the beautiful\nhair you have now that came to be in the CIA or after? - So I discovered I had messy hair in CIA 'cause I used to go muj, we called it muj. I used to go mujahideen style. Big burly beard and crazy wacky hair. Because an ambiguously\nbrown guy with a big beard and long hair can go anywhere in the world without anyone even noticing him. They either think that he is a janitor or they think that he is like some forgotten part of history. But nobody ever thinks\nthat that guy is a spy. So it was the perfect, for me, it was one of my favorite disguises. It's what's known as a level two disguise. One of my favorite disguises to don was just dilapidated brown guy. (both laughing) - Can you actually, we'll\njust take a million tangents. What's a level two disguise? What are the different levels of disguise? What are the disguises? - Yeah, there's three levels\nof disguise by and large. Level one is what we\nalso call light disguise. So that's essentially, you put\non sunglasses and a ball cap and that's a disguise. You look different than you normally look. So it's just different enough that someone who's never seen you before, someone who literally has to see you just from a picture on the internet, they may not recognize you. It's why you see celebrities\nwalk around with ball caps and oversized jackets and baseball hats 'cause they just need to\nnot look like they look in the tabloid or not\nlook like they look in TV. That's level one. Lemme jump from level one to level three. Level three is all of your prosthetics, all the stuff you see\nin \"Mission Impossible.\" Your fake ears, your fake\nfaces, your fat suits, your stilts inside your feet. All that's level three. Whenever they make any kind\nof prosthetic disguise, that's a level three disguise. Because prosthetics are very damning if you are caught with a prosthetic. If you're caught wearing a\nbaseball hat and sunglasses, nobody's gonna say, \"You're a spy.\" But when you're caught with\na custom made, you know, nose prosthetic, that changes\nthe way your face looks. Or when someone pops out a fake jaw and they see that your top\nteeth don't look like they did in this prosthetic, then all of a sudden you've got some very difficult questions to ask or to answer. So level three is extremely dangerous. Level one is not dangerous.\nLevel two is long-term disguise. Level two is all the\nthings that you can do to permanently change the way you look for a long period of time. So that whether you're\naggressed in the street or whether someone breaks\ninto your hotel room or whatever, it's real. So maybe you get a tattoo, maybe you cut your hair short, maybe you grow your hair\nlong, maybe you go bald, maybe you start wearing glasses. Well, glasses are\ntechnically a prosthetic, but if you have teeth pulled, if you gain 20 pounds,\nreally gain 20 pounds or lose 15 pounds, whatever you might do. All of that's considered level two. It's designed for a\nlong-term mission so that people believe you are who you\nsay you are in that disguise. - A lot of that is\nphysical characteristics? What about like, you know, what actors do, which is the..\n- [Andrew] method acting. - Yeah, the method acting sort of developing a backstory in your own mind and then you start, you know, pretending that you host a podcast\nand teach at a university and then do research and so on, just so that people can believe that you're not actually a agent. Is that part of the disguise levels or no? - So yes, disguise has to do\nwith physical character traits. That's what a disguise is. What you're talking about\nis known as a cover legend. When you go undercover,\nwhat you claim to be, who you claim to be, that's\ncalled your cover legend. Every disguise would theoretically have its own cover legend. Even if it's just to\ndescribe why you're wearing what you're wearing. It's all a cover. So the method acting,\nthis is a fantastic point that I don't get to make very\noften, so I'm glad you asked. The difference between\nCIA officers in the field and method actors is\nthat method actors try to become the character. They try to shed all vestiges\nof who they really are and become the character. And that's part of what\nmakes them so amazing. But it's also part of what, like, makes them mentally unstable\nover long periods of time. It's part of what feeds their\ndepression, their anxiety, their personal issues, because they lose sight\nof who they really are. Field officers don't get that luxury. We have to always, always remember we are a covert CIA intelligence officer collecting secrets in the field. We have to remember that. So we're taught a very specific skill to compartmentalize our\ntrue self separately, but make that true self the true identity. So then we can still live and act and effectively carry out\nour cover legend without ever losing sight, without ever\nlosing that compass true north of who we actually are. And then we can compartmentalize and secure all the information\nthat we need, retain it, remember it, but then\nreturn to our true self when we get back to a position of safety. - Is it possible to do that? So I just have kind of\nanecdotal evidence for myself. I really try to be the exact\nsame person in all conditions, which makes it very easy. Like if you're not lying,\nit makes it very easy to, first of all, to exist, but also to communicate\na kind of authenticity and genuineness, which I\nthink is really important. Like trust and integrity around trust is extremely important to me. It's the thing that opens doors\nand maintains relationships. And I tend to think, like\nwhen I was in Ukraine, so many doors just opened to the like very high security areas\nand everywhere else too. Like I've just interacted with some incredible people\nwithout any kind of concerns. You know, who's this guy,\nis he gonna spread it? You know, all that kind of stuff. And I tend to believe that you are able to communicate a trustworthiness somehow if you just are who you are. And I think, I suppose\nmethod actors are trying to achieve that by becoming something and I just feel like\nthere is very subtle cues that are extremely difficult to fake. Like you really have to become\nthat person, be that person. But you're saying as a CIA\nagent, you have to remember that you are there to collect information. Do you think that gives you away? - So one of the flaws in your argument is that you keep referring to how you feel. I feel this, I feel that, I feel like this I feel like that. That feeling is a\npredictable character trait of all human beings. It's a pink matter, we\ncall it pink matter. It's a cognitive trait. You are not alone in\ntrusting your feelings. All people trust their feelings. But because what CIA teaches us is how to systematically create\nartificial relationships where we're the one in\ncontrol of the source that is giving us intelligence. And the core element to being able to control a relationship is understanding the pink matter truth of feelings. What all people feel\nbecomes their point of view on what reality is. So when you understand and\nyou learn how to manipulate what people feel, then you\ncan essentially direct them to feel any way you want them to feel. So if you want them to feel\nlike they can trust you, you can make them feel that way. If you want them to feel\nlike you're a good guy or a bad guy, if you want them to feel like they should give you secrets, even though their government\ntells them not to, you can do that. There are men who make women\nfeel like they love them, and just so the women\nwill sleep with them. There are women who make\nmen feel like they love them just so the men will\ngive them their money. Manipulation is a core behavioral trait of all the human species because we all understand to some level how powerful feelings are, but feelings are not the same thing as logical, rational thought. They're two different sides of the brain. What CIA teaches us how to\ndo is systematically tap into the right side, emotional side\nof the brain so that we can quickly get past all of the\nstuff you were just saying. All of the well, don't\nyou have to be convincing and don't you have to\nreally know your story and don't you have to\nbe able to defend it, don't you have to have authenticity and don't you have to\nhave genuine feelings? Yes, all of those things\nare true if you're having a genuine relationship, but\nin an artificial relationship, there's ways to bypass all of that and get right to the\nheart of making someone feel comfortable and safe. - I guess the question I'm asking, and the thing I was implying is that creating an artificial relationship is an extremely difficult\nskill to accomplish the level. Like how good I am at being me and creating a feeling in\nanother person that I create, for you to do that artificially, my sense is you gotta be really damn good at that kind of thing. I would venture to say it's,\nI mean, I don't know how to measure how difficult the thing is, but especially when you're communicating with people whose job depends on forming trusting relationships, they're gonna smell bullshit. And to get past that\nbullshit detector is tough. It's a tough skill. - [Andrew] Well, it's interesting,\nso I would say that... - Or maybe I'm wrong actually on that. - I would say that once\nyou understand the system, it's not that hard. It makes a lot of sense. But I would also say\nthat to your exact point, you are right that people smell bullshit. People smell bullshit. But here's the thing, if you come in smelling like goat shit, you still smell like shit, but you don't smell like bullshit. So they don't count you out right away. And if you come in smelling\nlike rotten tomatoes or if you come in smelling like lavender, or if you come in smelling like manila or if you come in\nwithout any smell at all, all that matters is that you\ndon't smell like bullshit. Here's the thing that's one\nof the secret sauces of CIA. When you look and act like a spy, people think you're a spy . If you look and act in any\nother way, you know what, they never ever think you are? A spy. They might think you're an idiot. They might think you're trailer trash, they might think that\nyou're a migrant worker, but they never think you're a spy. And that lesson in everyday\nlife is immensely powerful. If you're trying to take your boss's job, as long as you don't ever\nlook like the employee who's trying to take the boss's job, the boss is focused on all the employees who are trying to take his job. Everybody's prioritizing\nwhether they know it or not. The goal is to just not be the\none that they're targeting. Target them without them\nknowing you're targeting them. - So people just, when they\nmeet you, they put you in a bin. And if you want to avoid\nbeing put in a particular bin, just don't act like the\nperson that will be, just show some kind of characteristics that bin you in some other way. - Exactly right. You have to be in a bin. Just choose the bin. (Andrew laughing) - Alright, so how you knowing these methods,\nwhen you talk to people,"

      "text": "especially in civilian\nlife, how do you know who's lying to you and not? - That gets to be more\ninto the trained skill side of things. There's body cues,\nthere's micro expressions. I don't believe that micro\nexpressions alone do anything. I also don't believe\nthat micro expressions without an effective baseline do anything. So don't for a second think that I'm... All the people out there pitching that you can tell if someone's lying to you just by looking at\ntheir face, it's all baloney. In my world, that's baloney. - Like the way you move your\neyes or something like that? - [Andrew] Without knowing a\nbaseline, without knowing... - For that individual.\n- For that individual, then you actually don't know. And an individual's baseline\nis based on education, culture, life experience, you name it, right? So it's huge. But when you combine facial\nexpressions with body movements, body language, nonverbal cues, and you add on top of that\neffective elicitation techniques that you are in control of, now you have a more robust platform to tell if someone's lying to you. - So there's like a set of\nlike interrogation trajectories you can go down that can\nhelp you figure out a person. - Technically they're interview concepts. - [Lex] Like this podcast concepts. - Correct, because an interrogation and interrogation is something very different than an interview. And in the world of professionals and interrogation is very different. - What's the difference? The nature or how relaxed\nthe thing is or what? - So in an interrogation there's a clear pattern of dominance. There's no equality.\nAlso, there's no escape. You are there until the\ninterrogator is done with you. Anybody who's ever been\nreprimanded by mom and dad knows what an interrogation feels like. Anybody who's ever been called\ninto the principal's office or the boss's office, that's\nwhat interrogation feels like. You don't leave until the\nboss says you can leave and you're there to answer questions, the boss asks questions. An interview is an\nequal exchange of ideas. You are in control of\nthis interview for sure. But if we were having coffee, I could take control if\nI wanted to take control, if I wanted to ask you\npersonal questions, I would, if I wanted to talk to you\nabout your background, I could. - Why am I in control of\nthis interview? Exactly. - Because the person in control is the person asking questions, always. - I'm sitting here, as\nyou've spoken about, my power here is I'm\nthe quiet one listening. (both laughing) - You're exactly right. Guess\nwhere this conversation goes? Anywhere you choose to take it, because you're the one asking questions. Every time I answer a question,\nI'm creating a pattern of obedience to you, which subliminally,\nsubconsciously makes me that much more apt to\nanswer your questions. - Of course you can always turn that and start asking me questions\nthat should, you know... But you're saying that there's, through conversation, you\ncan call it interviewing, you can start to see cracks in the story of the person and the degree to which\nthey exaggerate or lie or to see how much they could be trusted, that kind of stuff? - What I'm saying is that through a conversation you\ndevelop a baseline, right? Like even just in the first\npart of our conversation, I've been able to create some\nbaseline elements about you. You've been able to create\nbaseline elements about me. Maybe they're just not front of mind. From those baselines, now we can push through more intentional\nquestions to test... - [Lex] Got it. - To test whether or not\nthe person is being truthful because they're operating\nwithin their baseline. Or if you are triggering\nsensitivities outside of their baseline, and then you can start to see their tells. - That's fascinating, yeah baseline, like even like the tells, right? The eye contact. Like you've probably\nalready formed a baseline. I have trouble making eye contact. And so like, so if you\nask me difficult questions and I'm not making eye contact, maybe that's not a good signal\nof me lying or whatever. Because I always have\ntrouble making eye contact, stuff like that. That's really fascinating. - The majority of your eye\nmovement is to the right. Your right. My left, right? Which is usually someone who's, if you ask micro expressionists, that's someone who's referencing fact. That's not necessarily\nwhat's happening for you because you're pulling\nconcepts out of the air. So it's also a place that you reference something other than fact. It's a place for you to find creativity. So if I just thought that you were lying because you look up and to the right, I would be wrong. - That's so fascinating. And a lot of that has\nto do with like, habits that are formed and all\nthose kinds of things. Or maybe some right hand,\nleft hand type of situation. - [Andrew] Right eye dominance. - Right eye dominance is gonna\nmake you look to the right. - Is this a science or an art? - It's a bit of both. I would say that like all good art, art is taught from a foundation of skills. And those skills are played or taught in a very structured manner. And then the way that you use the skills after that's more of the artistic grace. So I've always called espionage\nan art. Spying is an art. Being able to hack human beings is an art, but it's all based in a\nfoundation of science. You still have to learn how\nto mix the color palette and use certain brushes. - Do you think of that as a kind of the study\nof human psychology? Isn't that what a psychologist\ndoes? Or a psychiatrist? What, from this process, have you learned about human nature? - [Andrew] Human nature? - I mean, I suppose the answer to that could be a book, and\nprobably will be a book. - [Andrew] I'll save you that, yeah. - But sort of is there\nthings that are surprising about human nature,\nsurprising to us civilians that you could speak to? - Yes, one thing is extremely\nsurprising about human nature, which is funny 'cause that's\nnot the answer I would've said. So I'm glad that you clarified\nthis specific question. The thing that's surprising\nabout human nature is that human beings\nlong, like in their soul, there's like a painful longing\nto be with other people. And that's really surprising because we all wanna\npretend like we're strong. We all wanna pretend like\nwe're, you know, independent. We all wanna pretend like we\nare the masters of our destiny. But what's truly consistent\nin all people is this like, longing to commune with others like us. My more practical answer\nabout what I've learned to be the truth is that\nhuman nature is predictable. And that predictability is what gives people an incredible\nadvantage over other people. But that's not the surprising piece. I mean, even when CIA taught me that human nature is\npredictable, it just made sense. I was like, oh yeah, that makes sense. But what I never ever\nanticipated was, no matter where I've been in the world,\nno matter who I've talked to, no matter what socioeconomic bracket, is that longing, man, it hurts. Loneliness sucks. And\ntogetherness feels good. Even if you're together\nwith someone you know isn't the right person, it still\nfeels better than being alone. - I mean, that's such a\ndeep truth you speak to. And I could talk about that for a long time. There is, I mean, through\nthese conversations in general, whether it's being recorded or not, I hunger to discover in the\nother person that longing, you strip away the other things and then you share in the\nlonging for that connection. And I particularly also\nhave detected that in people from all walks of life. Including people that others\nmight identify as evil or hard as completely cold, it's there. - It's there, they've hardened\nthemselves in their search and who knows what dark\nplace their brain is in, their heart is in. But that longing is still there. Even if it's an ember, it's there. It's the reason why in World War I and World War II, you know, enemy combatants still shared\ncigarettes on the front lines, you know, during periods of holidays or bad weather or whatever else. Because that human connection,\nman, it triumphs overall. - See, that's in part of what\nI refer to when I say love. Because I feel like if\nlike political leaders and people in conflict at the small scale and the large scale were able to tune into that\nlonging to seek in each other that basic longing for human connection. A lot of problems could be solved, but of course is difficult because it's a game of chicken is if you open yourself\nup to reveal that longing for connection with others,\npeople can hurt you. - Well, I would go a step farther and I would say that taking\nthe connection away, punishing, penalizing people by\nremoving the connection is a powerful tool. And that's what we see. That's\nwhy we send people to jail. That's why we put economic\nsanctions on countries. That's why we ground our children and send them to their rooms. We are penalizing them,\nwhether we know it or not. We're using punitive damage by taking away that basic human connection,\nthat longing for community."

      "section": "CIA recruitment process",
      "text": "- What was your recruitment\nprocess and training process and things you could speak to in the CIA? - As I was leaving the Air\nForce, all that was on my mind. I don't know what you were like at 27, but I was a total dip shit at 27. I'm not much better now at 42, but yeah... - You owe me both.\n(both laughing) Fake it till you make it. - But I was like, I just wanted to be anything other\nthan a military officer. So I was actually in\nthe process of applying to the Peace Corps through\nthis thing called the internet, which was still fairly\nrudimentary in 2007. I had a computer lab that we went to and it had 10 computers in\nit and you had to log in and log out and slow\ninternet and everything else. But anyways, I was filling\nout an online application to go work in the US Peace Corps. I wanted to grow my hair out. I wanted to stop wearing\nshoes that were shiny. I wanted to meet a hippie chick and have hippie babies in the wild, teaching Nigerian children how to read. So that was the path I was going down. And as I filled in all of my\ndetails, there came this page that popped up and it was\nthis blinking red page and it said, \"Stop here. You may qualify for other\ngovernment positions. If you're willing to put\nyour application on hold for 72 hours, that gives us a\nchance to reach out to you.\" So again, 27-year-old, I was like, sure, I'll put myself on hold if I might qualify for other government opportunities. And then about a day\nlater I got a phone call from an almost unlisted number. It just said 703, which was very strange to see on my flip phone at the time. Just one 703 area code. And I picked it up and it was a person from Northern Virginia telling\nme that I was qualified for a position in national security and if I would be interested,\nthey'll pay for my ticket and fly me up to Langley, Virginia. They didn't say CIA, they said Langley. I put one and one together and I was like, maybe this is CIA. Like this could, how cool is this? Or maybe this is all make-believe\nand this is totally fake. So either way it doesn't\nhurt me at all to say \"Yes\", they already have my phone number. So yes, yes, yes. And then I remember\nthinking, there's no way that happened and this isn't real. And then a day later I got\nFedEx or an overnight delivery of an airplane ticket and a hotel reservation and\na rental car reservation. And then I just kept doing the next thing, which I found out later\non as a form of control. You just do the next thing\nthat they tell you to do. And then before I knew\nit, I was interviewing in a nondescript building with a person who only told me their\nfirst name for a position with the National Clandestine Service. - So you never really got\na chance to think about it because there's a small\nsteps along the way and it kind of just leads you and maybe your personality such that... - [Andrew] That's an adventure. - It's an adventure and because\nit's one step at a time, you don't necessarily see\nthe negative consequences of the adventure. You don't think about any of that. You're just stepping into the adventure one step at a time. - And it's easy. There's no work involved. Somebody else is doing all the work telling me where to be and when. It's a lot like basic\ntraining in the military. Anybody who's ever been through\nbasic training will tell you they hated the first few days. And then by the end it\nwas really comforting because you just did what you were told. They told you when to eat, they made the decision of what to eat. Then you marched when\nthey told you to march, shined your shoes when they\ntold you to shine your shoes. Human beings love being told what to do. - What about the training process for becoming a covert CIA agent? - So the interview process is... - Yeah, the interview process too. How rigorous was that? - It was very rigorous. That was where it became difficult. Everything up to the\nfirst interview was easy, but there's three interviews\nand some people are lucky enough to have four or five interviews if something goes wrong or something goes awry with\nthe first few interviews. And again, this might be dated\nfrom what I went through, but during the interview process is when they do your psychological evaluations. They do personality assessments,\nthey do skills assessments. They'll start sending you back to your, wherever you're living with assignments. Not intel assignments, but actual like homework assignments. Write an essay about\nthree parts of the world that you think will be most impacted in the next three to five years. Or, you know, prioritize the\ntop three strategic priorities for the United States and you know, put it into\n250 words or 2,500 words and whatever else, double spaced in this\nfont, yada, yada, yada. Like super specific stuff. It's kind of stressful, but it's just like going back to college again. So you go through all of those acts and then you submit this\nstuff to some PO box that doesn't have anybody that's\never gonna respond to you. And then you hope you just\nsend it into the ether and you hope that you sent it right. You hope that you wrote well enough. You hope that your assessment was right, whatever else it might be. And then eventually get\nanother phone call that says, \"Hey, we received your package. You've been moved to the\nnext level of interview and now we need you to go to\nthis other nondescript building in this other nondescript city.\" And then you start meeting, you start sitting in waiting rooms with other groups of people who are at the same phase\nof interview with you, which were some of the coolest experiences that I remember still. One of my best friends to\nthis day who I don't get to talk to, 'cause he's still undercover, is a guy I met during\nthose interview processes. And I was like, oh, we met\nand I saw what he was wearing. He saw what I was wearing. I was brown. - So you immediately connected and you liked the people there? - Close. More like we\nimmediately judge each other. 'Cause we're all untrained. So he looked at me and he was like, brown\ndude with crazy hair. And I was wearing, dude, I\nwas dressed like a total ass. I was dressed in like a clubbing shirt. I don't know why I thought\nit would be a good idea to go to a CIA interview in\nlike a clubbing shirt with my buttons unbuttoned down to here. And he was like, after\nwe got in, he was like, \"Yeah dude, you were always\nreally cool to talk to.\" But I was like, there's no\nway that idiot's getting in. And I remember looking\nat him and being like, \"Dude, you were just another\nwhite guy in a black suit. They're not looking for\nyou. But here you are.\" So it was just, those kinds\nof things were so interesting 'cause we were totally wrong\nabout what CIA was looking for. Until you're in, you have no\nidea what they're looking for and you're just shooting in the dark. - Did they have you do\nlike a lie detector test? - Yes. It's called a polygraph. - Polygraph, how\neffective, just interesting Per our previous discussion. How effective are those? - Polygraphs are really interesting. So one of the things that people don't\nunderstand about polygraphs is that polygraphs aren't\nmeant to detect a lie. Like they're called a lie detector, but they're not actually\nmeant to detect a lie. They're built to detect variants from your physiological baseline. So they're essentially meant\nto identify sensitivities to certain types of questions. And then as they identify a\nsensitivity to a question, it gives the interviewer an\nadditional piece of information to direct the next round of questions. So then from there they can kind of see how sensitive you are to a\ncertain level of questions. And your sensitivity could\nbe a sign of dishonesty, but it could also be a\nsign of vulnerability. So the interrogator themselves,\nthe interviewer themselves, they're the one that have to make the judgment call as to which one it is. Which is why you might\nsee multiple interviewers over the course of multiple polygraphs. But that's really what they're all about. So I mean, they're\nextremely uncomfortable, like they're mentally uncomfortable. But then there's also, you sit on a pad because the pad is supposed to be able to tell like your body movements, but also like your sphincter\ncontractions or whatever. So you're sitting on this\npad, you're plugged in, you're strapped in, you're tied up, and it takes so much time to get in there. And then they start asking you questions, baseline questions at first, and then other questions from there. And you're just answering\nthe best you can. And you never know what they're seeing and you don't know what they're doing. And it's really hard not to\nget anxious of that anyways. - Are they the whole time\nmonitoring the readings? - Yeah, from like a big,\nthey've got multiple screens and it's all information superiority. They have information superiority. You're the idiot looking away from them or looking sideways of\nthem and trying not to move because you're afraid\nthat if you like have gas or if you move a little bit's gonna vary you from your baseline. And the whole time you're\nworried your heart's racing and your blood pressure's increasing, which is a variance from baseline. So yeah, I means an interesting art. - Or your baseline.\n- [Andrew] Correct. - Maybe there's some people that are just chilling the whole time and that's their baseline. - But that's what they're doing. They're establishing a baseline. I mean, I guess that means\nthe polygraph is a skill that you develop to do it well. - So when people talk about\nbeating a lie detector, it's not that they're\ntelling an effective lie. That's not hard. It's not hard to tell a\nlie to an interviewer. And the interviewer doesn't\ncare if you're being honest or not honest about a topic. What they're looking for is sensitivity. If they see no sensitivity,\nthat's a big sign for them. That's a big sign that you're\nprobably a pathological liar. If you show sensitivity to\nmany things, then that's a sign that you're probably an anxious person and they can still reset their baseline because they can tell how\nyour anxiety is increasing, you know, in 15 minute increments. It's a unique skill. I mean, a really good polygrapher\nis immensely valuable. But it's the misnomers, the misconceptions about\npolygraphs are vast. - You also mentioned personality tests. That's really interesting. So how effective are personality tests? One for the hiring process, but also for understanding a human being. - So personality is extremely important for understanding human being. And I would say that there's\na thousand different ways of looking at personality. The only one that I count with any significance is the MBTI. And the MBTI is what all\nthe leading spy agencies around the world use as well. - Well, that's kind of\ninteresting to hear. So there's been criticisms\nof that kind of test. - There have been\ncriticisms for a long time. - And you think there's value?\n- Absolutely. Absolutely. And there's a few reasons why, right? So first, MBTI makes the claim that your core personality\ndoesn't change over time. And that's how it's calibrated. And one of the big\narguments is that people say that your personality\ncan change over time. In my experience, the\nMBTI is exactly correct. Your core personality does not change because your core personality is defined as your personality when\nall resources are removed. So essentially your emergency\nmode, your dire conditions, that is your core personality. We can all act a little more extroverted. We can all, you know, be a little more empathetic\nwhen we have tons of time and money and patience. When you strip away all that\ntime, money, and patience, how empathetic are you? How much do you like\nbeing around other people? How much do you like being alone? Do you make judgements or do you analyze information? That's what's so powerful about MBTI, it's talking about what people are like when you strip away resources. And then because it's so consistent, it's also only four codes. It's super easy to be able\nto assess a human being through a dialogue, through\na series of conversations to be able to hone in with high accuracy, what is there four letter code. There's only 16 options and\nit becomes extremely valuable. Is it perfectly precise? And\ndoes everybody do it the same? I mean, the answers to those are no. But is it operationally useful\nin a short period of time? That is a resoundingly powerful yes. - Yeah I only know I\nthink the first letter, it's introvert and extroverted, right? - [Andrew] Yep.\nI've taken the test before, just like a crude version of the test. And that's the same problem\nyou have with IQ tests. There's the right thorough way of doing it and then there's like fun\ninternet way of doing. And do you mind sharing what your personality... - [Andrew] Yeah my type index?\n- Yes. - I'm an ENTP, that's an extrovert, intuitor, perceiver, thinker. ENT thinker, P perceiver. My wife is an ISFJ, which\nis the polar opposite of me. E, I'm extroverted. She's introverted. I'm an intuitive, she's a sensor. I'm a thinker. She's a feeler. I'm a perceiver. She's a judger. - Is there a good science on like long-term successful relationships in terms of the dynamics of that? The 16, I wonder if\nthere's good data on this. - I don't think there's a lot of good data in personalities writ large. Because there's not a lot of money to be made in personality testing. But I would say that with experience with a good MBTI test with a good paid test, a\n400, 500 question test. Once you understand your own code and then you're taught how\nto assess the code of others. With those two things kind of combined 'cause then you have\nexperience in learning. It becomes very useful. And you can have high\nconfidence in the conclusions that you reach about people's professions, about people's relationships with family, about people's relationships\nprofessionally, people's capabilities to deal with stress, how people will perform when pushed outside of\ntheir comfort zones. Really, really powerful useful\nstuff in corporate world and in the espionage world. - So in terms of compressed representation of another human being, you can't do much better\nthan those four letters. - I don't believe you can do much better. In my experience, I have\nnot seen anything better. - Yeah, it's difficult to realize that there is a core personality\nor the degree that's true. It seems to be true. It's even more difficult to\nrealize that there is a stable, or at least the science says so, a stable, consistent intelligence. Unfortunately, you know,\nthe G factor that they call that if you do a barrage\nof IQ test that's going to consistently represent that G factor. And we're all born with\nthat and we can't fix it. And that defines so much\nof who we are. It's sad. - I don't see it as sad because it's, for me,\nthe faster you learn it, the faster you learn what your\nown sort of natural strengths and weaknesses are, the faster\nyou get to stop wasting time on things that you're\nnever gonna be good at. And you get to double down on the things that you're already naturally\nskilled or interested in. So there's always a\nsilver lining to a cloud. But I know now that I\nwill never be a ballerina or a ballerino. I know that I'll never be an artist, I'll never be a musician. I'll never be any of those things. And when I was 18, that\nmight've made me sad. But now at 42, I'm like,\nwell shit, awesome. I can go be something else good instead of always being bad. - You're not gonna be a\nballerina (indistinct)? - Because I'm not graceful. - And you've learned this\nthrough years of experience. - [Andrew] Yeah, exactly. - Well, I don't know if\nthere's an MBTI equivalent for grace of movement. - I think it's called S sensor. Because a sensor is someone\nwho's able to interact with the world around them through their five\nsenses very effectively. Like if you talk to dancers, dancers can actually feel the\ngrace in all of their muscles. They know what position\ntheir finger is in. I don't have any idea, I don't know what position my feet are in right now. I'd have to look to make sure I actually feel the floor right. - Yeah, I definitely have...\nOh, that's good to know. So I don't, you know, I'm not\na dancer, but I do have that. - [Andrew] You're a musician man. - Well the music, I don't\nknow if that correlated - [Andrew] To be able to plug guitar. - Sure, yeah, that's true. There is that physical component, but I think deeper 'cause there's a technical aspect to that that's just like, it's less about feel. But I do know jiujitsu, you know, and grappling I've done all my life. I don't, you know, there's\nsome people who are clumsy and they drop stuff all the time. They run into stuff. I don't. First of all, I don't know\nhow that happens, but to me, I just have an awareness of stuff. Like if there's a little... - [Andrew] Spiritual orientation. - Yeah, like I know that\nthere's a small object I have to step over and I have\na good sense of that. It's so interesting. Yeah, you're just like born\nwith that or something. - My wife is brilliant and\nshe still walks into doors. I mean, she'll walk in a doorway, she'll bang her knee on the same wall that's been there for the last 50 years. - It's for some reason really hilarious. That's good for that.\n(Andrew laughing)"

      "text": "You've been asked, I think on Reddit, \"Are there big secrets that you know that could lend you and our\ncountry in terrible trouble if you came out to the public?\" And you answered, \"Yes, I\nwish I could forget them.\" So lemme ask you just\nabout secrecy in general. Are these secrets or just other secrets, ones that the public will never know or will it come out in 10, 20, 50 years? I guess the deeper question is what is the value of\nsecrecy and transparency? - The standard classification for all human intelligence operations is something called 25X2, 25 by 2. So 50 years, 25 years times\ntwo years, or times two rounds. So in essence, anything that\nI've seen has the first chance of becoming public domain\ndeclassified after 50 years, unless there's some\ncongressional requirement for it to be reviewed and assessed earlier. So by then, you know, I'll\nbe 80 something years old or potentially dead, which\nis either way, that's when it can come out according to\nits typical classification. The value of secrets I have seen is that secrets create space. Secrets give opportunity for security. They give opportunity for\nthinking they give space. And space is an incredibly\nadvantageous thing to have. If you know something\nsomebody else doesn't know, even if it's just 15 or\n20 minutes different, you can change the course of fate. So I find secrets to be extremely valuable, extremely useful. Even at the place where\nsecrets are being kept from a large mass, part of what all Americans\nneed to understand is that one of the trade-offs to\nbuilding a system of government that allows us to be first world and wealthy and secure and successful. One of the trade-offs is that we have given up a great\ndeal of personal freedom. And one of the personal freedoms that we give up is the freedom of knowing what we want to know. You get to know what the\ngovernment tells you. You get to know what you need to know or what you've learned yourself, but you don't get to know secrets. People who do get to know\nsecrets know them for a reason. That's why it's called a need to know. - How difficult is it to maintain secrecy? - It's surprisingly difficult\nas technology changes. It's also surprisingly difficult as our culture becomes one\nwhere people want notoriety, people wanna be the person\nwho breaks the secret. 25 years ago, 40 years\nago, that wasn't the case. There was a time in the United States where if someone gave you a secret, it was a point of personal\nhonor not to share the secret. Now we're in a place where\nsomeone tells you a secret like that could turn into a Twitter post that gets you a bunch of thumbs up and a bunch of likes or whatever else. - [Lex] It's an opportunity.\n- Right. So the value of secrets has changed and now there's almost a greater\nvalue on exposing secrets than there is on keeping secrets. That makes it difficult to keep secrets, especially when technology is\ngoing in the same direction. - Where is the line? And by the way, I'm one\nof those old school people with the secrets. I think it's a karma thing. Again, back to the trust. I think in the short term, you can benefit by sharing a secret. But in the long term, if people know they can trust you, like the juicy of the secret, it's a test of sorts, if\nthey know you can keep that secret, that means\nlike you're somebody that could be trusted. And I believe that like, not just effectiveness in this life, but happiness in this\nlife is informing a circle of people you can trust. - Right, we're taught that secrets and lies are similar in that\nthey have a limited shelf life. If you treat them like food. Secrets and lies have a\nvery limited shelf life. So if you cash in on them\nwhile they're still fresh, you beat them before they spoil. You get to take advantage\nof 'em before they spoil. However, trust has no\nlimit to its shelf life. So it's almost like you're\ntrading a short-term victory and losing a long-term victory. It's always better to keep the secret. It's always better to let the lie live because it will eventually come\nto light from somebody else, not from you, because it already\nhas a limited shelf life. But what you win in exchange\nfor not being the one that cashed in on the\nsecret is immense trust. - Let me ask you about\nlying and trust and so on. So I don't believe I've been contacted by or interacted with the CIA,\nthe MI6, the FSB, Massod or any other intelligence agency. I'm kind of offended.\n(Andrew laughing) But would I know if I was? So from your perspective.\n- No. You would not know if you were. For sure you've been on\ntheir radar. Absolutely. You've got a file, you've\ngot a dossier somewhere. - Why would I be on the radar? - [Andrew] Because you're...\n- Who's interesting - It's not necessarily that you are interesting to\nsomeone as a foreign asset or an intelligence collection source, but your network is extremely interesting. - The networks are important too? - Correct, if someone was\nable to clone your phone, every time you cross a border, you go through some sort of security. If you've ever been pulled into secondary and separated from your\nbag, that's exactly when and how people clone computers. They clone phones, they\nmake whatever photocopies of your old school planner,\nwhatever it might be. But for sure, you are\nan intelligence target. It just may be that you're\nnot suitable to be a person who reports foreign intelligence. We've gotta understand that all\npeople are potential sources of valuable information to the national security\ninfrastructure of our host country and any country that we visit. Someone like you with\nyour public footprint, with your notoriety, with your educational background, with your national\nidentifications, becomes a viable and valuable target of information. - Yeah, so to speak to that,"

      "text": "you know, I take security\npretty seriously, but not to the degree that, you know, it runs my life, which\nI'm very careful about. - [Andrew] That's good.\nI'm glad to hear that. - So the moment you start\nto think about germs, right, like you start to freak out and you become sort of\nparalyzed by the stress of it. So you have to balance those two things. If you think about all the things that can hurt you in this world and all the risk you can take it can overwhelm your life. That said, the cyber\nworld is a weird world. Because it doesn't have the same... I know not to cross the street\nwithout looking each way because there's a physical\nintuition about it. I'm not sure, you know,\nI'm a computer science guy, so I have some intuition,\nbut it's the cyber world, it's really hard to build up an intuition what is safe and not. I've seen a lot of people, you know, just a logging out of\nyour devices all the time, like regularly, just like\nthat physical access step is, a lot of people don't take, I can just like walk in into\nthe offices of a lot of CEOs and everything's wide open for physical access of those systems, which is kind of incredible for somebody, that sounds really shady, but it's not. I've written key loggers, like things that record\neverything you type and the mouse you moved and like, I did during my PhD, I was recording everything\nyou do on your device and everything you do on\nyour computer to under, like, people sign up to the study,\nthey willingly do this to understand behavior. I was trying to use machine\nlearning to identify who you are based on different biometric and behavioral things, which allows me to study human behavior and to see which is uniquely identifiable. And the goal there was to\nremove the need for a password, but how easy it is to write a thing that logs everything you type. I was like, wait a minute. Like I can probably get a\nlot of people in the world to run this for me. I can then get all of their passwords. I mean, you could do so much. Like I can run the entirety of\nthe CIA just myself if I was, and I imagine there's a lot of\nreally good hackers like that out there, much better than me. So I try to prevent myself from being all the different low\nhanging fruit attack vectors in my life. I try to make it difficult to be that. But then I'm also aware\nthat there's probably people that are like five steps ahead. - You're doing the right thing. What I always advocate is\nthe low hanging fruit is what keeps you from being\na target of opportunity because you're half-assed\nhackers, you're lazy hackers, your unskilled hackers they're looking for low hanging fruit. They're looking for the person\nwho gets the Nigeria email about how you could be getting $5 million if you just gimme your bank account. That's what they're looking for. And the thing that's scary is\nthat if you're not a target of opportunity, if you\nbecome a intentional target, then there's almost nothing you can do. Because once you become\nan intentional target, then your security apparatus, they will create a dedicated,\ncustomized vector of attacking your specific security apparatus. And because security\nis always after, right? There's the leading advantage and the trailing advantage. When it comes to attacks, the leader always has the advantage because they have to create the attack before anybody else can create a way to protect against the attack. So the attack always comes first and that means they\nalways have the advantage. You are always stuck just leaning on this is the best security that I know of. Meanwhile, there's always\nsomebody who can create a way of attacking the best security out there. And once they win, they have a monopoly. They have all that time until a new defensive\ncountermeasure is deployed. - Yeah, I tend to think\nexactly as you said, that the low hanging fruit\nprotects against like yeah, crimes of opportunity. And then I assume that\npeople can just hack in if they really want. - Think about how much\nanxiety we would be able to solve if everybody just accepted that. - Well, there's several things you do. First of all, to be honest, it keeps me honest not to be a douche bag or like not to assume everything could be public and so don't trade in information that could hurt people\nif it was made public. So I try to do that. And the thing I try to make sure is I like home alone style, try... (Andrew laughing)\n- [Andrew] A booby trap. - I really would like\nto know if I was hacked. And so I try to assume\nthat I will be hacked and detect it. - [Andrew] Have a trip wire of some sort. - Yeah, a trip wire through everything. And not paranoid trip\nwires, just like open door. But I think that's probably the future of life on this earth like, everybody of interest\nis going to be hacked. That hopefully inspires, now\nthis is outside of company. These are individuals I mean. There's of course if\nyou're actually operating, like who am I? I'm just a scientist\nperson, podcasting person. So if I was actually running a company or was an integral part of some kind of military operation,\nthen you have to probably have to have an entire team\nthat's now doing that battle of like trying to be ahead of like the best hackers in\nthe world that are attacking. But that requires a team that like full time is their focus. Even then you still get in trouble. - Correct, so what I've\nseen as the norm, well what I've seen is the cutting\nedge standard for corporations and the ultra wealthy and even intelligence organizations is that we have trip wires. If you can't prevent from being hacked, the next best thing is to know\nas soon as you get hacked, because then you can essentially terminate all the information. If you know it fast enough, you can just destroy the information. This is what the ultra wealthy do. They have multiple phones. So as soon as one phone gets\nhacked, the trip wire goes off, the operating system is totally deleted along with all data on the phone. And a second phone is turned on with a whole new separate set of metadata. And now for them, there's\nno break in service. It's just, oh, this phone went black. It's got a warning on it\nthat says it was hacked. So trash it 'cause they don't care about the price of the phone. Pick up the next phone and we move on. That's the best thing that\nyou can do essentially outside of trying to out hack the hackers. And then even in your intelligence and military worlds where\ncyber warfare is active, the people who are aggressing are not trying to create\naggression that beats security. They're trying to find\na aggressive techniques, offensive techniques that have no security built around them yet,\nbecause it's too cost and time intensive to protect against what you know is coming. It's so much more efficient\nand cost effective to go after new vectors. So it just becomes like, it becomes almost a silly\ngame of your neighbor gets a guard dog, so you\nget a bigger guard dog and then your neighbor gets a fence. So you're just constantly\noutdoing each other. It's called the security paradigm. People just one up each other because it's never worth it\nto just get to the same level. You're always trying to outdo each other. - Yeah, then maybe like banks\nhave to fight that fight. But not everybody can... Yeah, no, so you're saying I\noperate at the state of the art with the trip wires, this is good to know. - [Andrew] Absolutely, man. - And also just not using\nanybody else's services, doing everything myself. So that's harder to figure out what the heck this person is doing 'cause if I'm using\nsomebody else's service, like I did with QNAP.\n(Andrew laughing) I have a QNAP NAS I used for cold storage of unimportant things\nthat are large videos. And I don't know if you know, but QNAP is a company that\ndoes now storage devices and they got hacked. And everybody that didn't update as of a week ago from the point of the zero day hack,\neverybody got hacked. It's several thousands of machines. And they asked, you can get your data back if you pay, I forget what it was, but it was as about a couple thousand dollars. And the QNAP can get all the data back for their customers if they\npay, I think $2 million. But that came from me relying on the systems of others for security. I assumed this company would\nhave their security handled. But then those very\nvaluable lessons to me. I now have like layers of security and also an understanding\nwhich data is really important, which is somewhat important,\nwhich is not that important and layering that all together. - So just so you know, the US government, the military woke up to\nthat exact same thing about two years ago. It's still very new. I mean, they were sourcing, take night vision goggles, for example. They were sourcing\ncomponents and engineering and blueprints for night vision goggles from three, four, five\ndifferent subcontractors all over the country. But they never asked themselves\nwhat the security status was of those subcontractors. So, you know, fast forward,\nyou know, a few years and all of a sudden they start\ngetting faulty components. They start having night vision\ngoggles that don't work. They start having supply\nchain issues where they have to change their provider. And the army doesn't know\nthat the provider is changing. I mean, this is a strategy. The idea of going through\nthird party systems is identifying the vulnerability\nin the supply chain. That's a savvy offensive practice for more than just, you\nknow, cyber hackers. - Let me ask you about physical hacking. So I'm now like, I'm a introvert, so I'm a paranoid about\nall social interaction. But how much truth is there?"

      "text": "It's kind of a funny question. How suspicious should I be\nwhen I'm traveling in Ukraine or different parts of the world when an attractive female walks up to me and shows any kind of a attention? (Andrew laughing)\nIs that like this kind of James Bond spy movie stuff? Or is that kind of stuff used\nby intelligence agencies? - I don't think it's used.\nIt's absolutely used. It's called sex-spionage. That's the term that we jokingly\ncall it, is sex-spionage. But yeah, the art of attraction, appeal, the manifestation of feelings\nthrough sexual manipulation, all of that is super powerful tool. The Chinese use it extremely well. The Russians use it extremely well. In the United States, we actively train our\nofficers not to use it because in the end, it\nleads to complications in how you professionally run a case. So we train our officers not to use it. However, you can't control\nwhat other people think. So if you're an attractive male or an attractive female officer and you're trying to talk to a, you know, an older general who\njust happens to be gay or happens to be straight and is attracted to you,\nof course they're gonna be that much more willing\nto talk to an American who is also attractive. So it's (indistinct). - Well in all definitions, so it could be all elements of charisma. So, you know, attractiveness\nin a dynamic sense of the word. So it's visual attractiveness. But the smile, the humor,\nthe wit, the flirting, all that kind of stuff that could be used to the art of conversation. - There's also elements of sexuality that people underestimate, right? So physical sexuality, physical attraction is\nthe most obvious one. It's the one that everybody\ntalks about and thinks about. But then there's also sapiosexuality, which is being sexually attracted to thoughts, to intelligence. And then you've got all\nthe various varieties of personal preferences. Some people like people\nof a certain color skin or they like big noses,\nthey like small noses, they like big butts,\nthey like small butts, they like tall guys, they like bald guys. Whatever it might be,\nyou can't ever predict what someone's preferences,\nsexual arousal preferences are going to be. So then you end up\nwalking into a situation where then you discover, you know, and just imagine being an unattractive, overweight, married guy. And you're walking into an asset or a target meeting with\nlike a middle aged female who is also not very\nattractive and also married. But then it turns out that\nthat person is a sapiosexual and gets extremely turned on\nby intelligent conversation. That's exactly what you're there to do. Your mission is to have\nintelligent conversation with this person to find out\nif they have access to secrets. And by virtue of you\ncarrying out your mission, they become extremely\naroused and attracted to you. That is a very complicated situation. - It's hard to know who to trust. Like how do you know your wife\nor how does your wife know that you're not a double\nagent from Russia? - There's a large element of experience and time that goes into that. She's also trained and I\nthink my wife and I also.. - [Lex] So you think,\n- Yeah, my wife and I also have the benefit of being recruited young and together where... - So over time you can\nstart to figure out things that are very difficult to... So you form the baseline, you start to understand the person, it becomes very difficult to lie. - The most difficult thing\nin the world is consistency. It's the most difficult\nthing in the world. Some people say that discipline or self-discipline, what they're really talking about is consistency. When you have someone\nwho performs consistently over long periods of time\nunder various levels of stress, you have high, high confidence that that is the person that you can trust. You can trust again, you can trust them to behave within a certain pattern. You can trust an asshole to be an asshole without trusting the asshole\nto take care of your kids. So I don't ever wanna mix up the idea of personal trust versus\ntrusting the outcome. You can always trust a person to operate within their\npattern of behavior. It just takes time for you to get consistent feedback as to what that baseline is for them - So would form a good\nmodel, predictive model of what their behavior's going to be like. - Right and you know, what's\nfascinating is I think the challenge is building\nthat model quickly. So technology is one of those tools that will be able in the future to very quickly create\na model of behavior. Because technology can pull\nin multiple data points in a very short period of time that the human brain simply can't pull in at the same speed. - Well, that's actually\nwhat I did my PhD on. That's what I did at Google, is forming a good representation,\nunique representation, across the entire world based on the behavior of the person. The specific task there is, so that you don't have\nto type in the password. The idea was to replace the password. But it also allows you to\nactually study human behavior and to think, all right,\nwhat is the unique representation of a person? 'Cause we have very specific patterns and a lot of humans are very\nsimilar in those patterns. What are the unique identifiers within those patterns of behavior? And I think that's, from\na psychology perspective, a super fascinating question. And from a machine learning\nperspective, it's something that you can, as the systems\nget better and better and better, and as we get more and more digital data\nabout each individual, you start to be able to do that kind of thing effectively. - And I mean, when I think of the fact that you could create a\ndossier on somebody in a matter of 24 or 48 hours, if you could wire them for two days, right? Internet of things style. You put it in their\nunderwear or whatever, right? Some chip that just reads everything. How heavy are they walking?\nHow much time do they sleep? How many times do they\nopen the refrigerator? When they log into their\ncomputer, how do they do it? Like which hand do they\nuse when they log in? What's their most common swipe? What's their most visited website? You could collect an enormous amount of normative data in\na short period of time where otherwise we're stuck. The way that we do it\nnow, once or twice a week, we go out for a coffee for two hours. And two hours at a time, over the course of six,\neight weeks, 12 weeks, you're coming up with a 50% assessment on how you think this person\nis going to be behave. Just that time savings is immense. - Something you've also spoken\nabout is private intelligence and the power and the reach and the scale"

      "text": "and the importance of private intelligence versus government intelligence. Can you elaborate on the role of what is private intelligence and what's the role of private\nintelligence in the scope of all the intelligence that is gathered and used in the United States? - Yeah, absolutely, it's something that so few people know about, and it became a more mainstream topic with the Trump administration because Trump made it no\nsecret that he was going to hire private intelligence organizations to run his intelligence\noperations and fund them. So that really brought\nit to the mainstream. But going all the way back to 9/11, going all the way back to 2001. When the 9/11 attacks happened,\nthere was a commission that was formed to determine the reasons that 9/11 happened. And among the lists that they determined, of course they found out that\nthe intelligence community wasn't coordinating well with each other. There were fiefdoms and\nthere was infighting and there wasn't good intel sharing. But more than that, they\nidentified that we were operating at Cold War levels, even though we were living\nin a time when terrorism was the new biggest threat\nto national security. So the big recommendation\ncoming outta the 9/11 commission was that the intelligence organizations, the intelligence community\nsignificantly increased the presence of intelligence\noperators overseas and in terms of analytical capacity here in the United States. When they made that decision,\nit completely destroyed, it totally was incongruent with\nthe existing hiring process because the existing\nhiring process for CIA or NSA is a six to nine month process. The only way they could plus\nup their sizes fast enough was to bypass their own hiring and instead go direct to\nprivate organizations. So naturally the government\ncontracted with the companies that they already had secure\ncontracts with, Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman,\nKhaki, you know, you name it. And then over time, from 2001 to now, or I guess that started really in 2004, when they started significantly increasing the presence of private\nintelligence officers. From then until now, it's become a budgetary thing. It's become a continuity\nof operations thing. And now the reason Northern Virginia has become one of the wealthiest\nzip codes in America is because of the incredible concentration of private intelligence that is supporting CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI, and all\nthe slew of IC partners. - By the way, does Palantir\nplay a role in this? - Palantir is one of those\norganizations that was trying to pitch their product to\nan intelligence community because it's a fantastic product on paper. But the challenge was\nthe proprietary services, the proprietary systems that we used in CIA prior to Palantir, continued to outperform Palantir. So just like any other business decision, if you've got homegrown systems that outperform external systems and it's not worth it to share\nthe internal information. - Got it, so the close connection between Peter Thiel and Donald Trump, did that have a role to play in Donald Trump's leveraging\nof private intelligence? Or is that completely disjoint? - I think that they're related,\nbut only circumstantially because remember Donald\nTrump wasn't really investing in CIA, so the last thing\nhe wanted to do was spend his network wasta. Wasta is a term that we call influence. It's an Arabic term for influence. Trump didn't want to use his\nwasta putting Thiel into CIA only to lose Thiel's contract\nas soon as Trump left office. So instead, it was more valuable\nto put Peter Thiel's tool to use in private intelligence. And then of course, I think\nhe nominated Peter Thiel to be his Secretary of\nDefense, Secretary of State. At some point in time, he tried to like presidentially appoint\nPeter Thiel into a position of government authority. - What do you think of\nfigures like Peter Thiel? And I'm sure there's\nfigures of similar scale and reach and power in\nprivate intelligence. What do you think about their role and power in this whole, like without public accountability that you would think\ndirectors of CIA perhaps have? - So this is where private intelligence has both a strength and a weakness. The ultimate law overriding that's overseeing private intelligence is not government legislation. It's the law of economics. If they produce a superior product, then they will have a buyer. If they do not produce a superior product, they will not have a buyer. And that's a very simple\nbusiness principle. Whereas in the current national\nsecurity infrastructure, you can create a crap product, but the taxpayer dollars are\nalways going to be spent. So it's really thrown things for a loop, especially during the\nTrump administration. And this is one of the things\nthat I will always say I liked about the Trump administration. It put a big blazing bright light on all of the flaws within our system. One of those flaws being\nthis executive power over the intelligence organizations and the lack of accountability for intelligence organizations to produce a superior product. When that light got shown down, that's when you also saw\nTrump start to go after. If you remember, there was a period where he was taking\nsecurity clearances away from retiring officers. That became a big, hot issue. That became something that\npeople were very opposed to when they didn't realize that that process of taking security clearances away, that incentivized seasoned senior officers to stay in service. Because with private\nintelligence paying a premium during the Trump administration, because Trump was paying a premium to the private intelligence world. When senior officers found\nthat it was more profitable to retire early, keep their clearance and go work for Raytheon, Trump saw that as bypassing service\nto the American people. You've made a career in CIA,\nyou've made a career in NSA, you should stay there. If you leave, you lose your clearance because you no longer have a need to know. He upset the apple cart with that. And unfortunately, the narrative\nthat came out in many ways was a negative narrative against Trump, when in fact he was actually\ndoing quite a service to the American people trying\nto take away the incentive of senior officials leaving\ntheir service in order to just profiteer in the\nprivate intelligence world. - So in that way, he was\nkind of supporting the CIA in making sure that competent people and experience people stay\nand say are incentivized to stay there. - Correct, I think that\nthere was definitely, he understood incentives. I mean, Donald Trump\nunderstands incentives. So he was trying to\nincentivize them to stay, but I think he was also\nplaying a safety card because he didn't want\nformer CIA officials who were not listening to him to then move into private\nintel organizations that he may be hiring only to then have them undermine\nhim from both sides of the coin. So there was a little bit\nof offensive calculation in there as well. - But do the dynamics and the incentives of\neconomics that you refer to, that the private\nintelligence operates under, is that more or less\nethical than the forces that maybe government\nagencies operate under? Like what's your intuition?\nIs capitalism lead? So you mentioned it leads to\nmaximizations of efficiency and performance, but\nis that correlated with ethical behavior when we're talking about such hairy activities like\ncollection of intelligence? - The question of ethics\nis a great question. So let me start this\nwhole thing out by saying, CIA hires people on a spectrum of our ability to be morally\nflexible, ethically flexible. All people at their heart\nare ethically flexible. I would never punch\nsomebody in the face. Right? Some people out there would say, \"I would never hurt another human being.\" But as soon as a human\nbeing posed a direct threat to their daughter or their son or their mother, now all of\na sudden they're gonna change their ethical stance\nin self-defense. Right? But at the end of the day, it's still hurting another person. So what CIA looks for is people\nwho are able to swing across that spectrum for lesser offenses. More flexibility, I do not\nbelieve that private intelligence and the laws of economics lend themselves to increased ethics or increased ethical\nbehavior in the short term. But what ends up happening\nis that in the long term, in order to scale economic\nbenefits, you are forced to act within norms of your customer base. So as the norms of that customer base dictates certain requirements, the company has to adapt\nto those requirements in order to continue to scale. So if a company tries to ostracize LGBTQ, or if they try to ostracize men or ostracized women, they're\nlimiting their ability to grow economically. They have to adapt to whatever is the prevailing\nethical requirement of their customer base. - That's such an interesting question 'cause you look at big pharma\nand pharmaceutical companies and they have a quite a poor\nreputation in the public eye. And some of it, maybe\nmuch of it is deserved, at least historically speaking. And so you start to wonder,\nwell, can intelligence agencies use some of the same technique\nto manipulate the public, like what they believe about\nthose agencies in order to maximize profit as well,\nsort of finding shortcuts or unethical paths that allow you to not be ultimately responsible to the customer. - Absolutely and I would go\na step further to say that the covert nature of\nintelligence operations is really attractive when it\ncomes to the private sector because now they have\nall the same money with none of the oversight, and all\nthey have to do is deliver. So without the oversight,\nwhat's holding you back? And for anybody who's ever run a business, anybody who's ever started a startup or tried to make something succeed, we all know that there come\nthose times where you have to skirt the boundaries of proprietary or morality or commitments\nor promises to other people. Because at the end of the day, if your business fails, it's on you. So if you promise to deliver\nsomething to a client, you've gotta deliver it to the client. Even if that means you stay up late or if you lie on your\ntaxes, whatever it might be, there's a certain level of do or die. - Yeah, I personally have\na sort of optimistic view that ultimately the best way is to stay within the ethical bounds, kind of like what you suggested,\nif you want to be a company that's extremely successful,\nis win with competence, not with cheating. 'Cause cheating won't, I\nbelieve, win in the long term. But in terms of being publicly responsible to your decisions, I mean, I've already been supposed to talk to Peter Thiel twice on this podcast, and it's just been complicated. (Andrew laughing) If I were to put myself into his shoes, why do podcasts? The risk is too high to\nbe a public person at all. And so I totally understand that. At the same time, I think\nif you are doing things by the book and you're the best in the world at your job, then you have nothing to worry about. And you can advertise that and you help recruit. I mean, that's the work of capitalism is you want to advertise\nthat this is the place where the best people in the\nworld at this thing work. - True. I think that your\npoint of view is accurate. I would also say that the complexities of what\nmakes somebody make a decision can only really be properly\ncalculated with a baseline. So because there is no baseline that you or I have on Peter Thiel, it's difficult to really ascertain why he does or doesn't accept invites or why he does or doesn't appear."

      "section": "NSA and Snowden",
      "text": "- Well, let me ask your opinion on the NSA and then maybe we could\nmention about bulk collection in general in the CIA, but, you know, let's look at some history with the NSA and Snowden. What's your opinion on\nthe mass surveillance that is reported to have been conducted by the NSA? We talked about ethics. Are you troubled from\nof a public perception, the unethical nature of mass surveillance of\nespecially American citizens? - This is a topic that I never\nget tired of talking about, but it's very rare that anyone\never really agrees with me. Just so you know. (both laughing) - I think there's a nuance thing here. Maybe we'll find some agreement. - The truth is that\nthe American experience after 9/11 is nothing like\nthe American experience now. So all the terminology,\nall this talk about privacy and privacy laws and mass surveillance and all this other stuff,\nit was a completely different time then. And that's not to say it was an excuse, because to this day, I will\nstill say mass collection, bulk collection of data that allows for an expedient\nidentification of a threat to national security benefits all of us. But people don't\nunderstand what they want. Like people don't\nunderstand what the value of their own privacy is. First of all, the fact that people think they have personal privacy is laughable. You have no privacy. The cell phone that you\ncarry in your pocket, you're giving permission\nto those apps constantly. You're giving commercial\norganizations, what you and I have already said are less tied to ethical responsibility. You're giving them permission\nto collect enormous amounts of private data from you all the time. And do you know what happens\nif AT&T or Verizon sees some nefarious activity on your account? They do nothing. They might send a note to FBI because they have to\naccording to some checklist. But when NSA was collecting\nintelligence on metadata from around the United States,\nthey were very specifically looking for terrorist threats that would harm American lives. Man, NSA can clone my phone. I will give them my children's phone. I will give them the passwords\nto every one of my accounts if it means that there's a likelihood that my family will be\nsafer from a nefarious actor whose intent on hurting us. NSA doesn't care about your affair. NSA doesn't care if you're\ncheating on your taxes. NSA doesn't care if you\ntalk about shit your boss or if you hate the US President,\nnobody cares about that. Your intelligence community\nis there to find threats to national security. That's what they're there to do. What Snowden did when he\nouted that whole program, the fact that the court,\nthe justice system, the civilian justice system went back and essentially overruled the ruling of the intelligence courts\nbefore them, just goes to show how the general mass community\nreally shouldn't have a say in what happens in the\nintelligence community. They really shouldn't. You have politicians and\nyou have the opportunity to elect people to a position\nand then you trust them. That's what a representative republic is. You vote the people in, you trust them to work on your behalf. They make decisions\nwithout running 'em by you. They make decisions that they believe are in the best interest\nof their constituency. And that's how our form\nof democracy works. It worked. We were safer. Now that we don't have that information and now that there's this giant\nlooming question of whether or not NSA is there to serve people or is collecting mass surveillance against all American people, that's not really a true\naccurate representation of what they were ever doing. They were looking for\nthe needle in a haystack of the series of transactions\nin metadata that was going to lead to American deaths. We are now less secure\nbecause they can't do that. And that bothers me. - So you said a few really\ninteresting things there. So because you are kind of an\ninsider, at war for a time, an insider, meaning you were able to build up an intuition\nabout the good, the bad, and the ugly of these institutions,\nspecifically the good. A lot of people don't have\na good sense of the good. They know the bad and the ugly or can infer the bad and the ugly. You mentioned that the one\nlittle key little thing there at the end saying the NSA doesn't care about whether you hate\nthe president or not. Now that's what people really worry about, is they're not sure they\ncan trust the government to not go into full dictatorial mode. And based on your political\npreference, your oppositions, your basically one of the essential powers the freedom of speech in the United States is the ability to\ncriticize your government. And they worry well, can't the government get ahold of the NSA and start to ask the basic question, well, can you gimme a list of people that are criticizing the government? - So let's just walk through that exact example, right? Because it's a preponderance. It's a preponderance fear. It's a ridiculous fear because you would have to\ntap on multiple elements of government for anything to happen. So for example, let's just say\nthat somebody goes to the NSA and says, \"Hey, can you give\nus a readout on all the people who are tweeting terrible\nthings about the president?\" Okay, cool, here's your\na hundred million people, whatever it is, right? Here's all the people\nsaying negative things about the government. So now they have a list.\nWhat do they do next? Well, let's just make it simple. They stay with NSA and they\nsay, \"Surveil them even more. Tap their phones, tap their computers. I wanna know even more.\" So then they get this\npreponderance of evidence. What do you do with evidence?\nYou take it to a court. Well, guess what? No court is going to support anything that goes against the freedom of speech. So the court is not going to support what the executive is asking them to do. Even before you take somebody to court, you have to involve law enforcement. Essentially you have to send\nsome sort of police force to go apprehend the\nindividual who's in question. Well, guess what doesn't meet criteria for any police force anywhere\nin the United States? Arresting people who say negative things about the president. Now, if somebody poses\na threat to the life of a public figure or the\nthreat to life of a politician, that's a completely different case. Which means the standards\nof evidence are much higher for them to arrest that person. So unless you create\na secret police force, then your actual public police force is never gonna take action. So all these people who are afraid of this exact situation that you're outlying, they need the creation\nof a secret police force. The creation of a secret\ncourt that operates outside the judicial system, the creation of a secret intelligence\nservice that operates outside of foreign intelligence collection. All so that a handful of people\nwho don't like the president get what whisked away,\nassassinated, put in prison, who knows what. Think about the resources,\nthe amount of money and time and how hard would it\nbe to keep that secret, to have all of those things in motion. The reason it worked in\nRussia and Soviet, Germany or Russia and Communist Germany was because everybody knew\nthere was a secret police. Everybody knew that like, that\nthere was a threat to work to speaking out against the government. It's completely different here. - Well, so there's a lot to say. So one is yes, if I was a\ndictator and I wanted to, and just looking at history, let me take myself out of it. But I think one of the more effective ways is you don't need the surveillance. You can pick out a random person and in a public display,\nsemi-public display, you know, basically put 'em in jail for opposing the government,\nwhether they oppose it or not. And the fear that sends a\nmessage to a lot of people. - That's exactly what you\nsee happening in China. What you just laid out. It's genius. And that is the standard bottle. - You don't need the\nsurveillance for that. But that said, if you\ndid do the surveillance, so that's the support, the sort of the incentives aren't aligned. It seems like a lot of work to do for the thing you could do\nwithout the surveillance. But you know, yes, the courts wouldn't, if you were to be able\nto get a list of people, which I think that part you could do. That opposed the government,\nyou could do that just like you said on Twitter publicly, you could make a list. And with that you can start to, especially if you have a\nlot of data on those people find ways in which they\ndid violate the law. Not because they opposed the government, but because in some other\nway the parking tickets or didn't pay the taxes. That's probably a common one. Or like screwed up\nsomething about the taxes. I just happen to know Russia and Ukraine, they're very good at this kind of stuff. Knowing we how the citizens\nscrewed everything up. Because especially in those countries, everybody's breaking the law because in a corrupt nation, you have to bend the law to operate. Like the number of people\nthat pay taxes fully in those nations is just\nvery low, if not zero. And so they then use that\nbreaking of the law to come up with an excuse to actually\nput you in jail based on that. So it is possible to imagine. But yes, I think that's the ugly part of surveillance. But I do think, just like you said, the incentives aren't correct. Like you really don't need to\nget all of the secret police and all of these kinds\nof organizations working. If you do have a\ncharismatic, powerful leader that built up a network\nthat's able to control a lot of organizations to\na level of authoritarianism in a government, they're just able to do the usual thing. One, have propaganda\nmachine to tell narratives. Two, pick out, you know, people\nthat they can put in jail for opposing the state and maybe loud members of the press start silencing the press. There's a playbook to this thing, and that doesn't require the surveillance. The surveillance, you know, what is useful for the surveillance is the\nthing you mentioned in China, which is encourage everybody in the citizenry to watch each\nother to say there's enemies of the state everywhere. And then you start\nhaving children reporting on their parents and that kind of stuff. Again, don't need a\nsurveillance state for that. Now, the good of a surveillance system, if it's operating within\nethical bounds, is that yes, it could protect the populace. So you're saying like the good,\ngiven on your understanding of these institutions, the\ngood outweighs the bad? - Absolutely. So lemme give\nyou just a practical example. So people don't realize this, but there's multiple surveillance\nstates that are out there. There are surveillance states that are close allies\nwith the United States. One of those surveillance states is the United Arab Emirates, the UAE. Now I lived in the UAE from 2019 to 2020. Came back on a repatriation\nflight after Covid broke out. But we were there for a full year. We were residents, we had\nIDs, we had everything. Now, when you get your\nnational ID in the Emirates, you get a chip and that chip\nconnects you to everything. It connects you to\ncameras, it connects you to your license plate on your car, to your passport, to your\ncredit card, everything. Everything is intertwined. Everything is interlinked. When you drive, there are no police, there are no police on the roads. Every 50 to 100 meters you cross a camera that reads your license plate, measures your speed, and if you're breaking the speed limit, it just immediately\ncharges your credit card because it's all tied\ntogether, totally surveillance. That technology was invented by the Israelis who use it in Israel. When I was in Abu Dhabi, and I was rear-ended at high\nspeed by what turned out to be an Emirati official, a senior ranking official\nof one of the Emirates. It was caught on camera. His ID was registered,\nmy ID was registered, everything was tied back to our IDs. The proof and the evidence\nwas crystal clear. Even still, he was Emirati. I was not. So when I went to the police\nstation to file the complaints, it was something that\nnobody was comfortable with because generally speaking, Emiratis don't accept legal claims against their own from foreigners. But the difference was\nthat I was an American and I was there on a contract supporting the Emirati government. So I had these different variances, right? Long story short, in the\nend, the surveillance states is what made sure that justice was played because the proof was incontrovertible. There was so much evidence collected because of the surveillance\nnature of their state. Now why do they have a surveillance state? It's not for people like me. It's because they're constantly afraid of extremist terrorist activity happening inside Abu Dhabi or inside the UAE because they're under\nconstant threat from Islam or from extremists. And they're under\nconstant threat from Iran. So that's what drives the\npeople to want a police state to want a surveillance state. For them, their survival is paramount and they need the surveillance\nto have that survival. For us, we haven't tasted\nthat level of desperation and fear yet, or hopefully never. But that's what makes us\nfeel like there's something wrong with surveillance. Surveillance is all about the purpose. It's all about the intent. - Well, and like you said, companies do a significant\namount of surveillance to provide us with services\nthat we take for granted. For example, just one of\nthe things to give props to the digital efforts of the Zelensky administration in Ukraine, I don't know if you're aware, but they have this digital\ntransformation efforts where you could put, like, it's laughable to say\nin the United States, but they actually did a really good job of having a government app\nthat has your passport on it. It's all the digital information\nyou can get a doctor. It's like everything that you would think America\nwould be doing, you know, like license, like all that kind of stuff. It's in an app, you could pay each other. There's payment to each\nother, and that's all coming. I mean, there's probably\ncontractors somehow connected to the whole thing, but that's like under\nthe flag of government. And so that's an incredible technology. And I didn't, I guess, hear anybody talk about\nsurveillance in that context, even though it is. But they all love it and it's super easy. And frankly already, it's\nso easy and convenient they've already taken for granted that of course, this is what you do. Of course your passport is on your phone. - Yep, for everybody to have, housed in a server that you\nhave no idea where it's at. That could be hacked at\nany time by a third party. - They don't ask these kinds of questions because it's so convenient. As we do for Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Microsoft products we use. - Security and convenience\nare on two opposite sides of another spectrum. The more convenient something\nis, the less secure. And the more secure something\nis the less convenient. And that's a battle that we're always working with as individuals and then we're trying to outsource that battle to our politicians. And our politicians are frankly just more interested in being politicians. - Yeah, that said, I mean,\npeople are really worried about giving any one institution\na large amount of power, especially when it's a\nfederal government institution given some history. First of all, just\nhistory of the corruption, of power corrupting\nindividuals and institutions. And second of all, myth or reality of certain institutions\nlike the CIA misbehaving. Well, let me actually ask\nyou about the Edward Snowden. So outside of the utility\nthat you're arguing for of the NSA surveillance program, do you think Edward Snowden\nis a criminal or a hero? - In terms in the eyes of the law? He's a criminal. He broke the law. He broke the confidence. He was under security obligation. And then when he ran\naway, he ran away to all of the worst villains in the\nworld from the US perspective to basically seek protection. How you act in the face of accusation is in essence part of the case that you build for yourself. So running away to China, Russia, Cuba, there was a Latin Ecuador I think, that just paints a very negative picture that does not suggest that\nyou were doing anything that was ethical and upright and in favor of the American people if you're gonna run to American\nenemies to support yourself. So for sure in the eyes\nof law, he's a criminal. In the eyes of a group of people who are largely ignorant\nto what they lost. To them, he's a hero. To me, he's just kind of a sad case. I personally look at Snowden\nas a sad, unfortunate case. His life is ruined. His\nfamily name is tarnished. He's forever going to be a desperate pawn. And that's all because of\nthe decisions that he made and the order that he made them. - I'm not sure his name is tarnished. I think the case you're making\nis a difficult case to make. And so I think his name represents fighting one man. It's like Tiananmen Square\nstanding before the tank. Is like one man fighting the government. And I think that there is\nsome aspect to which taking that case aside, that\nis the American spirit, which is hold the powerful accountable. So whenever there's somebody in power, one individual can change can... - One man can make a difference. - [Lex] Can make a difference. - It's very \"Night Rider\" of you. (Andrew laughing)\n- It's powerful. Well, I mean that's the\nAmerican individualism. And so he represents that. And I think there's a huge skepticism against large federal institutions. And I think if you look at\nthe long arc of history, that actually is a forcing\nfunction for the institutions to behave their best. So basically hold them accountable. - What's nice about this is\nthat we can agree to disagree and history will be the one that decides. But like there's a reason that Edward Snowden\nneeds to do something new every 16 or 18 months to remain relevant. Because if he didn't, he\nwould just be forgotten. Because he was not a maverick who changed history for the better. He was a man who broke a\nlaw and now he's on the run. And to some people, he is a hero. To other people, he's a criminal. But to the vast majority,\nhe's just a blip on a radar of their everyday life that really makes no difference to them at all. - So actually let's linger on that. So just to clarify, are you making the difficult case that the NSA mass surveillance\nprogram was one, ethical and two, made a better\nworld for Americans? - I am making the case that\nat the time it was exactly what we needed to feel\nsafe in our own homes. - But what about to be\nsafe, actually be safe? - So this is what's difficult because any proof that they collected that actually prevented\nan attack from happening is proof we'll never know about. This is the really unfortunate side of intelligence operations, and I've been at the front end of this. You work your ass off,\nyou take personal risk, you make personal sacrifice to make sure that something terrible doesn't happen. Nobody knows that that ever happens. - Does that have to be that way? Does it have to remain\nsecret every time the NSA or the CIA saves the lives of Americans? - It does for two reasons.\nIt has to be secret first. The mythos, the same thing\nwe were talking about with General Petraeus. You can't brag about your victories if you want to let the myth\nshape itself, you can't do that. The second thing is, once a victory is claimed, the danger comes from\nletting your enemy know that you claimed the victory. Because they can reverse engineer and they can start to\nchange how they did things. If a terrorist cell tries\nto execute an operation, the operation fails. From their point of view,\nthey don't know why it failed. They just know that it failed. But then if the US or if the American government comes in and says, \"We took apart\nthis amazing attack\", now they have more information. The whole power of secrets,\nlike we talked about before, the power of secrets is in knowing that not everybody has them. There's only a shelf life. So take advantage of the shelf life. You get space. So you\ngotta keep it a secret. There is no tactical advantage\nfrom sharing a secret unless you are specifically trying to achieve a certain tactical\nadvantage from sharing that secret, which is\nwhat we've seen so much of with US intel sharing with Ukraine. There's a tactical advantage\nfrom sharing a secret about Russian military movements\nor weaknesses in tanks or, you know, supply chain\nchallenges, whatever it might be. - Well, let me argue that\nthere might be an advantage to share information\nwith the American public when a terrorist attack is averted or the lives\nof Americans are saved. Because what that does... - Is make every American think\nthat they're not that safe. There is no tactical advantage there. - [Lex] You think so?\n- Absolutely. If the Austin PD started\ntelling you every day about these crazy crimes that they prevented, would that make you feel more safe? It would make you feel like\nthey're doing their job. - Is that obvious to you? Make us feel less safe? 'Cause if we see competence that there is extremely competent\ndefenders of this territory, of these people, wouldn't that\nmake us feel more safe or no? - The human nature is\nnot to assign competence. So empirically humans overvalue losses and undervalue gains. That's something that we've seen from finance to betting and beyond. If the Austin Police\nDepartment starts telling you about all these heinous\ncrimes that were avoided because of their hard work, the way that your brain is\nactually going to process that information is you are going to say, if this is all the stuff\nthat they've stopped, how bad must this place be? How much more haven't they stopped? - I take your point. It's a powerful psychological point, but I, looking at the other picture of it, looking at the police force,\nlooking at the CIA, the NSA, those people and now with the police, there's such a negative feeling amongst Americans towards\nthese institutions. Who the hell wants to work for the CIA now and the police force? Like you're gonna be criticized. Like that's really bad for the CIA. - [Andrew] It's terrible. - Like, as opposed to\nbeing seen as a hero. Like for example, currently soldiers are for the most part seen as heroes that are protecting this nation. That's not the case for the CIA - Soldiers weren't seen as\nheroes in the Vietnam War. You've gotta remember that\nwhen you, so first of all, public service is a sacrifice. We oftentimes forget that. We start to think, oh,\ngovernment jobs are cushy and they're easy. And it must be so easy to be the president 'cause then you're basically\na celebrity overnight. Public service is a sacrifice. It's a grind. For all of the soldiers, the\nsubmariners, the missiles, the police officers,\nintelligence specialists, they all know what it's\nlike to give things up to serve a public that\ncan turn its opinion at any given time. And history is what defines it. The more important thing is to understand that if you want a true\nopen and fair democracy, you cannot control a narrative and starting to share\nall of your victories or starting to share\nyour biggest victories with the intent of shaping public opinion, to be supportive of the police\nforce or supportive of CIA or supportive of you name\nit, is shaping a narrative that is intentional,\noperational use of influence to drive public opinion. That is something nobody\nwants to get into. It is much more professional\nto be a silent sentinel, a silent servant, humbly\ncarrying the burden of public service in the United States where we are AU, bear and open democracy. - Why not celebrate\n(Andrew laughing) the killing of Bin Laden?\n- [Andrew] We did. - The search, discovery and the capture and the killing of Bin Laden. Actually the details of that, how much of the details of that, how he was discovered were made public? I think some of it was made public enough. Why not do that? Doesn't that make heroes out of the people that are servants? Do people who serve, do\nservice for this nation, do they always have to operate in a thankless manner in the shadows? - I think that's a very good question. The folks who I left\nbehind when I left CIA, who continue to serve as faceless, nameless heroes every day,\nI am grateful to them. The truth is that if they were motivated by something else, they\nwouldn't be as good as they are at doing what they do. And I see your point about shouldn't we be celebrating our victories? But when celebrating our\nvictories runs the risk of informing our enemies, how we operate, giving away\nour informational advantage, giving away our tactical\nbattlefield advantage, and running the risk of shaping\na narrative intentionally among our own American people. Now all of a sudden we're\nturning into exactly the thing that the American people\ntrust us not to become. - Yeah. but then you\noperate in the secrecy,"

      "text": "and then there's corrupt and\ndouchebag people everywhere. So when they, even inside the CIA and criminals inside the CIA, there's criminals in all organizations, in all walks of life. Human nature is such that\nthis is always the case. Then it breeds conspiracy theories. - It does and sometimes\nthose conspiracy theories turn out to be true, but\nmost times they don't. That's just part of the\nrisk of being a myth. - Can you speak to some of\nthe myths? So MKUltra... - Not a myth. - Not a myth, so this is a\nfascinating human experimentation program undertaken by the\nCIA to develop procedures for using drugs like LSD to\ninterrogate people through, let's say, psychological manipulation and maybe even torture. The scale of the program\nis perhaps not known. How do you make sense\nthat this program existed? - Again, you've gotta look\nthrough the lens of time. You've gotta look at where we were historically at that time. There was the peak of the Cold War. Our enemies were doing the\nsame kind of experimentation. It was essentially another space race. What if they broke through\na new weapon technology faster than we did? What would that mean for the safety and security of the American people? So right decision or wrong\ndecision, it was guided by and informed by national\nsecurity priorities. So from this program that\nwas designed to use drugs to drive interrogation and torture people, was born something very\nproductive, Operation Stargate, which was a chance to use remote viewing and metaphysics to try\nto collect intelligence. Now, even though in the\nend the outcome of MKUltra and the outcome of Stargate were mixed, nobody really knows if they did or didn't do what they\nwere supposed to do. We still know that to this\nday, there's still a demand in the US government and in CIA for people who have sensitivities\nto ethereal energies. - By the way, is there any proof that that kind of stuff works? It shows that there's interest, it shows that there's openness to consider those kinds of things. But is there any evidence\nthat that kind of stuff works? - If there's evidence, I haven't seen it. Speaking from a science-based\npoint of view only, if energy and matter\ncan always be exchanged, then a person who can understand and become sensitive to\nenergy is a person who could become sensitive to\nwhat does become matter. - Yeah, I mean, the basics of\nthe physics might be there, but a lot of people\nprobably are skeptical. - I'm skeptical too, but\nI'm just trying to remain... - But you should be open-minded, right? I mean, that's actually, you know, that's what science is\nabout, is remain open-minded, even for the things that are long shots, because those are the things that actually define\nscientific revolutions. What about Operation Northwoods? It was a proposed 1962\nfalse flag operation by the DOD and the CIA to\nbe carried out by the CIA to commit acts of terrorism on Americans and blame them on Cuba. So JFK, the president\nrejected the proposal. What do you make that this was on the table, Operation Northwoods. - So it's interesting. First\nI'm glad that JFK rejected it. That's a good sign. So we have to understand that good ideas are oftentimes\nborn from bad ideas. I had a really good friend\nof mine who actually went on to become a pastor, and he\nused to say all the time that he wanted all the\nbad ideas on the table. Like \"Gimme all your bad ideas\" every time we had any\nkind of conversation. And I was always one of\nthose people who was like, isn't a bad idea just a waste of time? And he was like, \"No 'cause\nthe best ideas oftentimes come from bad ideas.\" So again, Cuban Missile Crisis, mass hysteria in the United\nStates about nuclear war from Cuba, missiles\nblowing up American cities faster than we could even see them coming. It makes sense to me that\na president would go to, especially the part of CIA, which is the special activities division. It makes perfect sense to\nme that a president would go to a division called special activities, whose job it is to create,\nyou know, crazy ideas that have presidential approval, but nobody knows they exist. So it makes sense that he would\nchallenge a group like that to come up with any wacky idea, right? Come up with anything. Just\nlet's start with something. 'Cause we can't bring\nnothing to the table. We have to do something\nabout this Cuban issue. And then that's how an operation like that could reasonably be born. Not because anybody wants to do it, but because they were tasked\nby the president to come up with five ideas. And it was one of the ideas. That still happens to this day. The president will still come in, but it'll basically send out a notice to his covert action arm and he will say, \"I need this and I need it on Wednesday.\" And people have to come back with options for the thing he asked for, a finding. He will issue a presidential finding, and then his covert action\narms have to come back and say, \"Here's how we would do this.\" And hide the hands of the Americans. - How gangster was it of\nJFK to reject it though? - It was baller, right?\n(Lex laughing) That is a mic drop right there. Nope, not doing that. Yep, doing that. - You know, a thing that\ncrosses an ethical line, even in a time where the entirety of human civilization hangs in a balance, still forfeit that power. That's a beautiful thing about the American experiment. A few times throughout its history that's has happened, including with our first President\nGeorge Washington. Well, let me ask about JFK. (Andrew laughing) - 25 times two, and they still\nkeep that stuff classified. - So do you think the CIA had a hand in\nthe assassination of JFK? - I cannot imagine in any\nreasonable point of view that the organization of\nCIA had anything to do with the assassination of JFK. - So it's not possible to infiltrate a small part of the CIA in\norder to attain political or criminal gains or financial? - Yeah, absolutely it's\npossible to infiltrate CIA, there's a long history of\nforeign intelligence services infiltrating CIA from\nAldrich Ames to Jerry Lee, recently with China. So we know CIA can be infiltrated. Even if they are infiltrated, and even if that's interlocutor executes on their own agenda or the agenda as directed\nby their foreign adversary, their foreign handler, that's different than organizational support for an event. So I do think it's possible\nthey could have been infiltrated at the time, especially, it was a massive, a major priority for the\nCubans and the Russians to infiltrate some aspect\nof US intelligence. Multiple moles were caught\nin the years following. So it's not surprising that there would be a priority for that. But to say that the organization of CIA was somehow in cahoots to independently assassinate\ntheir own executive, that's a significant stretch. I've seen no evidence to support that. And it goes contrary to everything I learned\nfrom my time at CIA. - Well, let me ask you, do you think CIA played a\npart in enabling drug cartels and drug trafficking, which is another big kind of shadow that hangs over the CIA. - At the beginning of the drug war, I would imagine the answer is yes. CIA has its own\ncounter-narcotics division. A division that's dedicated to fighting and preventing narcotics from\ncoming into the United States. So when you paint a picture for me, like do you think the CIA was complicit in helping drug trafficking or drug use? When I say yes, my exception\nis I don't think they did that for Americans inside the United States. If the CIA can basically set it up so that two different drug\ncartels shoot each other by assisting in the transaction of a sale to a third country and then leaking that that sale happened to a competing cartel, that's just letting\ncartels do what they do. That's them doing the dirty work for us. So, especially at the\nbeginning of the drug war, I think there was tons of\nspace, lots of room for CIA to get involved in the economics of drugs and then let the inevitable happen. And that was way more efficient, way more productive than us\ntrying to send our own troops in to kill a bunch of cartel warlords. So that makes a ton of sense to me. It just seems efficient,\nit seems very practical. I do not believe that CIA would like, I don't think all the\naccusations out there about how they would\nbuy drugs and sell drugs and somehow make money\non the side from it. That's not how it works. - So do you think, on\nthat point, a connection between Barry Seal, the great governor, and then President Bill\nClinton, Oliver North and vice president, former\nCA director George H.W. Bush in a little town with a little airport called Mena, Arkansas. - So I am outta my element now. This is one I haven't\nheard many details about. - So your sense is any\nof the drug trafficking has to do with criminal operations\noutside the United States and the CIA just leveraging that to achieve its end, but nothing\nto do with American citizens and American politicians - With American citizens, again,\nspeaking organizationally. So that would be my sense. Yes. - Let me ask you about, so\nback to Operation Northwoods, because it's such a powerful tool, sadly powerful tool used by\ndictators throughout history, the false flag operation. So I think there's, and you said the terrorist attacks in 9/11 changed a lot for us, for the United States, for Americans. It changed the way we see the world. It woke us up to the\nharshness of the world. I think there's, to my eyes\nat least, there's nothing that shows evidence that 9/11\nwas a quote \"inside job.\" But is the CIA or the intelligence agencies or the US government capable\nof something like that? (Andrew laughing) I mean, that's the question.\n- I get it, yeah. - So there's a bunch of shadiness about how was reported on. I just can't, that's the\nthing I struggle with. While there's no evidence\nthat there was an inside job, it raises the question to me, well, could something like\nthis be an inside job? 'cause it's sure as heck,\nnow, looking back 20 years, the amount of money that\nwas spent on these wars, the military industrial complex, the amount of interest in terms of power and money involved, organizationally, can\nsomething like that happen? - You know Occam's razor. So the harems razor is that\nyou can never prescribe to conspiracy what could be\nexplained through incompetence. Those are two fundamental guidelines that we follow all the time. The simplest answer is oftentimes the best and never prescribe to conspiracy what can be explained\nthrough incompetence. - Can you elaborate what you\nmean by we? As human beings? - [Andrew] We, as\nintelligence professionals. - So you think there's a deep\ntruth to that second razor? - There us more than a deep truth. There's ages of experience\nfor me and for others. - So in general, people are incompetent. If left to their own means, they're more incompetent\nthan they are malevolent at a large organizational scale. - People are more incompetent\nof executing a conspiracy than they are of competently, yeah, than they are of competently\nexecuting a conspiracy. That's really what it means,\nis that it's so difficult to carry out a complex lie that most people don't have\nthe competency to do it. So it doesn't make any sense\nto lead thinking of conspiracy. It makes more sense to\nlead assuming incompetence. When you look at all of the outcomes, all the findings from 9/11,\nit speaks to incompetence, it speaks brashly and\nopenly to incompetence, and nobody likes talking about it. FBI and CIA to this day\nhate hearing about it. The 9/11 commission is\ngonna go down in history as this painful example\nof the incompetence of the American intelligence community. And it's going to come\nback again and again. Every time there's an intel flap, it's gonna come back again and again. What are you seeing? Even right now, we missed the\nUS intelligence infrastructure misjudged Afghanistan,\nmisjudged Hong Kong, misjudged Ukraine's, and\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine. Those were three massive\nmisjudgments in a few years. - It's just embarrassing to the end. - It's just embarrassing. Exactly right. - So all the sort of\ncoverup looking things around 9/11 is just\npeople being embarrassed by their failures. - If they're taking steps\nto cover anything up, it's just their own. It's a painful reminder of their lack of competency at the time. Now, I understand that\nconspiracy theorists want to take inklings of information and put them together in a way that is the most damning. But that goes back to our\npoint about overvaluing losses and undervaluing gains. It's just predictable human behavior. - Let me ask you about this,\nbecause it comes up often. So I'm from MIT and there's a guy by the\nname of Jeffrey Epstein that still troubles me to this day. That some of the people\nI respect were interacted with this individual and fell into his influence, charm, charisma, whatever the hell he used\nto delude these people. He did so successfully. I'm very open-minded about this thing. I would love to learn more, but a lot of people tell me,\na lot of people outta respect that there's intelligence\nagencies behind this individual. So they were using Jeffrey\nEpstein for getting access to people and then to control and manipulate those powerful people. The CIA, I believe is not\nbrought up as often as Mossad. And so this goes back\nto the original aspect of our conversation is how much each individual\nintelligence agency is willing to go to control, to manipulate, to achieve its means. Do you think there is,\ncan you educate me if obviously you don't know, but you can bet. What are the chances the\nintelligence agencies are involved with the character of Jeffrey Epstein - In some way, shape or form\nwith the character of Epstein? It's 100% guaranteed.\n- [Lex] Ah dammit. - That some intelligence\norganization was involved. But let's talk about why. Let's talk about why, okay? There's multiple types\nof intelligence assets, just like we were talking earlier. There's foreign intelligence\nreporting assets, there's access agents, and then\nthere's agents of influence. Three different categories\nof intelligence, right? One is a, when you talk about foreign intelligence reporters, these are people who\nhave access to secrets and their job is to give you\ntheir secrets in exchange for gold or money or alcohol or prostitution or whatever else, right? Their job is to give you secrets and then you pay them for the secrets. Access agents, their job is\nto give you physical access or digital access to\nsomething of interest to you. So maybe they're the ones that open a door that should have been\nlocked and let you come in and stick your thumb\ndrive in the computer. Or maybe they're the ones that share a phone number with somebody and then they're just like, just don't tell 'em you got\nthe phone number from me. Their job is to give you access. Then you have these agents of influence. An agent of influence's job is to be part of your effort to influence the outcomes in some way that benefits your intelligence\nrequirements, right? Of these three types of people, the least scrupulous and the most shady is\nyour agent of influence. Because your agent of influence understands exactly what they're doing. They know they're working with one guy, and they know they're using the influence to manipulate some other guy. When it comes to powerful people, especially wealthy, powerful people, the only thing that\ninterests them is power. Money is not a challenge anymore. Prestige, notoriety, none of\nthose things are a challenge. The rest of us, we're\nbusy trying to make money. We're busy trying to build a reputation. We're busy trying to build a career, keep a family afloat. At the highest levels, they're bored. They don't need any of that. The only thing that\nthey care about is being able to wield power. So a character like\nJeffrey Epstein is exactly the kind of character that\nthe Chinese would want, the Russians would\nwant, Mossad would want, the French would want. It's too easy because the man had access to a wide range of American influential people\nfor corporate espionage uses, for economic espionage uses, for national security espionage uses. It doesn't make any sense\nthat a person like that wouldn't be targeted. It doesn't. - So the question is who and whether I think the really important distinction here is, was Jeffrey Epstein created,\nor once he's achieved and built his network,\nwas he then infiltrated? And that's a really sort\nof important difference. Like at which stage do you\nconnect a person like that? You start to notice\nmaybe they're effective of building a network and then you start building a relationship to where at some point it's a\njob, they're working for you. Or do you literally\ncreate a person like that? - Yeah, so intelligence organizations have different strategies here. In the United States, we never create, we don't have a budget cycle\nthat allows us to create, I mean, the maximum budget\ncycle in the United States is five years. So even if we were to try to\ninvest in some seed operation or create some character of influence, essentially every year you have to justify why you're spending budget. And that becomes very difficult\nin a democracy like ours. However, Russia and\nChina are extremely adept at seed operations, long-term operations. They are willing to invest and develop and create an agent that\nserves their purposes. Now, to create someone from\nscratch, like Jeffrey Epstein, the probabilities are extremely low. They would've had to start with like a thousand different targets and try to grow a thousand\ndifferent, if you will, influencers, and then\nhope that one of them hits kind of like a venture\ncapital firm, right? Invest in many hope that a few hits. More likely they observed him at some point in his own natural rise. They identified his\npersonal vulnerability, very classic espionage technique. And then they stepped in,\nintroduced themselves mid-career and said, \"Hey, we know you\nhave this thing that you like, that it's frowned upon by your own people, but we don't frown upon it, and\nwe can help you both succeed and, you know, have an endless supply of ladies along the way.\" - I've recently talked to Ryan\nGraves, who's a lieutenant, Ryan Graves, who's a fighter jet pilot about many things. He also does work on autonomous\nweapon systems, drones and that kind of thing, and\nincluding quantum computing. But he also happens to be\none of the very few pilots that were willing to go on record and talk about UFO sightings."

      "section": "CIA and UFOs",
      "text": "Does the CIA and the federal government\nhave interest in UFOs? - In my experience at CIA, that is an area that remains very compartmented. And that could be one of two reasons. It could be because there\nis significant interest and that's why it's so\nheavily compartmented. Or it could be because it's an area that's just not important. It's a distraction. So they compartment it\nso it doesn't distract from other operations. One of the areas that I've\nbeen quite interested in and where I've done a lot of research, and I've done some work in\nthe private intelligence and private investigation\nside, is with UFOs. The place where UFOs really connect with the federal government\nis when it comes to aviation safety and predominance of power. So FAA and the US Air Force and the US military are\nvery invested in knowing what's happening in the skies\nabove the United States. And that's of primary interest to them. When they can rule out the direct threat to national security of UFOs, then they become less interested. That said, when you have\nunexplained aerial phenomenon that are unexplained, that\ncan't directly be tied to anything that is known\nof the terrestrial world, then they're left without\nan answer to their question. They don't know if it's\na threat or not a threat. But I think the scarier concern for the US national government or for the US federal\ngovernment, the scarier concern that nobody talks about is\nwhat if the UFO isn't alien? What if it is actually a cutting edge war machine that we are eons behind ever being able to replicate? - Or the other concern\nis that it's a system, it's a machine from a foreign power that's doing intelligence collection. - [Andrew] Correct.\n- So it's not just military purposes, it's\nactually collecting data. - Well, a lot of times the\nfederal government will see the two as the same. It's a hostile tool from\na foreign government. - Oh, so collection of\ninformation is a hostile act. - Absolutely. That's why\nthe Espionage Act exists. That's why it's a criminal\noffense if you're committing espionage in the United States as a US citizen or a foreign citizen. - So I guess they keep digging until they can confirm it's not a threat. And you're saying that there's not, from your understanding much\nevidence that they're doing, so it could be because\nthey're compartmentalized, but you're saying private\nintelligence institutions are trying to make progress on this? Yeah, it's really difficult\nto know the scale. - Yeah, there's an economic interest in the private intelligence world. Because for example, if you understand why\ncertain aerial phenomenon are happening over a location,\nthen you can use that to inform investors whether\nto invest in that location or avoid investment in that location. But that's not a national\nsecurity concern. So it doesn't matter to\nthe federal government. - Could these UFOs be aliens? Now I'm going into a territory of you as a human being wondering about all the alien\ncivilizations that are out there. The humbling question. - We are not alone. - [Lex] You think we're not alone? - It's an improbability that we are alone. If by virtue of the fact that\nsentient human life exists, intelligent human life\nexists, all the probabilities that would have to be\ndestroyed for that to be true, simply speak over the galaxies that exist that there's no possible way we're alone. It's a mathematical equation.\nIt's a one or a zero. And for me, it has to exist. It's impossible otherwise,\nrationally for me to think that we are truly the\nonly intelligent life form in all of the universe. But to think that an alien life form is anything\nlike us at all, is equally as inconceivable to think\nthat there are carbon-based, bipedal, humanoid, alien\nspecies that just happen to fly around in metal machines and visit alien planets in a\nway that they become observed, it's just silly. It's the world of sci-fi. - [Lex] Well, let me push... - What does every good scientist... 'Cause we always assume that they're superior\nto us in intelligence. When any scientist\ncarries out an experiment, the whole objective of the\nexperiment is to observe without being disclosed\nor being discovered. So why on earth would we think that the superior\nspecies makes the mistake of being discovered over and over again? - So, to push back on\nthat idea, if we were to think about us humans trying\nto communicate with ants. First, we observe for a\nwhile, there'll be a bunch of PhDs written, a bunch of people just sort of collecting data, taking notes, trying to understand about\nthis thing that you detected that seems to be a living thing, which is a very difficult thing to define from an alien perspective. Or from our perspective, we find life on Mars\nor something like that. Okay, so you observe for a while, but then if you want to\nactually interact with it, how would you interact with the ants? If I were to interact with\nthe ants, I would try to infiltrate, I would try\nto put, like, figure out what is the language they used to communicate with each other. I would try to operate at\ntheir physical scale, at like, in terms of the physics of\ntheir interaction, in terms of the information methods,\nmediums of information exchange with pheromones or whatever,\nhowever the heck ants. So I would try to mimic them in some way. So in that sense, it makes sense that the objects we would see,\nyou mentioned bipedal. Yes, of course it's ridiculous that aliens would actually be very similar to us, but maybe they create\nforms in order to be like, here, the humans will understand it. And this needs to be sufficiently\ndifferent from humans to know that there's something weird. I don't know., I think\nit's actually an incredibly difficult problem of figuring\nout how to communicate with a thing way dumber than you. And people assume, like if you're smart, it's easy to talk to the dumb thing. But I think it's actually\nextremely difficult when the gap in intelligence is just\norders of magnitude. And so of course you can observe, but once you notice the thing\nis sufficiently interesting, how do you communicate with that thing? - So this is where one of\nthe things I always try to highlight is how conspiracies are born. Because many people don't\nunderstand how easy it is to fall into the conspiratorial cycle. So the first step to a\nconspiracy being born is to have a piece of evidence that is true. And then immediately\nfollowing the true evidence is a gap in information. And then to fill in\nthe gap of information, people create an idea, and then the next logical\noutcome is based on the idea that they just created, which is an idea that's based on something that was imagined in the first place. So the idea, the factual\nthing is now two steps away, and then three steps away, four steps away as the things go on. And then all of a sudden you\nhave this kernel of truth that turned into this wild conspiracy. So in our example, you talked about humans trying\nto communicate with ants. Ants are not intelligent. Ants are not an intelligent species. They're drone species\nthat's somehow commanded through whatever technology, whatever... - Spoken like a typical human, but yes. - Whatever biological thing\nis in the queen, right? But it's not a fair equivalent. But let's look at gorillas\nor let's look at something in the monkey family, right? Where largely we agree that there is some sort of intelligence there, or dolphins, some sort of intelligence, right? It is A human thing to want to observe and then communicate and integrate. That's a human thing, not\nan intelligent life thing. So for us to even think that a foreign and intelligent alien species would want to engage in communicate at all, is an extremely human assumption. And then from that assumption, then we started going into\nall the other things you said. If they wanted to communicate,\nwouldn't they wanna mimic. If they wanted to mimic, wouldn't they create devices like ours? So now we're three steps\nremoved from the true fact of there's something\nunexplainable in the skies. - Yeah, so the fact is there's\nsomething unexplainable in the skies, and then\nwe're filling in the gaps with our basic human biases. But the thing is... - Now we're getting right\nback to project Northwood. We need some plan. I don't care how crazy the idea\nis, guys, give me some plan. So that's where we come up with, well, maybe it's an alien\nspecies trying to communicate or maybe it's an alien, a\nhostile threat that's trying to take over the world or\nwho knows what, maybe it's... - I mean, but you have to\nsomehow construct hypotheses and theories for anomalies. And then from that amidst giant pile of\nthe ridiculous emerges perhaps a deeper truth over period of decades. And at first that truth is ridiculed and then it's accepted. You know, that whole process. - The earth revolving around the sun. - Yeah, the earth\nrevolving around the sun. But you know, to me it's interesting because it's asks us\nlooking out there with SETI, just looking for alien life is forcing us to really ask questions about\nourselves, about what is life, how special, first of\nall, what is intelligence? How special is intelligence in the cosmos? And I think it's inspiring and challenging to us as human beings, both on a scientific\nand engineering level, but also on a philosophical level. I mean, all of those\nquestions that are laid before us when you start\nto think about alien life. - So you interviewed Joe Rogan recently. And he said something\nthat I thought was really, really brilliant during\nthe podcast interview. He said that you... - He's gonna love hearing that. (both laughing) - Well, go ahead, sorry. - But he said that he\nrealized at some point that the turn in his\nopinion about UFOs happened when he realized how desperately\nhe wanted it to be true. This is the human condition. Our pink matter works the same way as everybody's pink matter. And one of the ways that\nour pink matter works is with what's known as a cognitive bias. It's a mental shortcut. Essentially, your brain\ndoesn't want to process through facts over and over again. Instead, it wants to assume\ncertain facts are in place and just jump right to the conclusion. It saves energy, it saves megabytes. So what Joe Rogan, I feel weird calling him\nJoe, I don't know him. But what Joe identified on his own... - Mr. Rogan,\n- What Mr. Rogan identified on his own was his own cognitive loop. And then he immediately grew\nsuspicious of that loop. That is a super powerful tool. That is something that\nmost people never become self-actualized enough to realize that they have a cognitive loop, let alone questioning\ntheir own cognitive loop. So when it came to this\ntopic specifically, that was just something that\nI thought was really powerful because you learned to not\nnot trust your own mind. - Just for the record,\nafter he drinks one whiskey, all that goes out. I think that was just\nin that moment in time, like, you know... - [Andrew] A moment of brilliance. - A moment of brilliance. Because I think he still is... One of the things that\ninspires me about Joe is how open-minded he is, how curious he is. He refuses to let sort of the conformity and the conventions of any one community, including the scientific\ncommunity, be a kind of thing that limits his curiosity\nof asking what if, like the whole, it's entirely possible. I think that's a beautiful thing, and it actually represents\nwhat the best of science is, that childlike curiosity. So it's good to sort of\nbalance those two things, but then you have to wake up to it, like, is there a chance this is true or do I just really want it to be true? - Like the hot girl that\ntalks to you overseas. - Yeah, yeah.\n(Andrew laughing) For a brief moment.\n(Andrew laughing) There's a actually a\ndeeper explanation for it that I'll tell you off\nthe mic that perhaps a lot of people can kind\nof figure out anyway... - Just to take it one step further 'cause I love this stuff. Personally, I love pink matter stuff. In your interview with Jack Barsky, Jack's a good friend of mine. - A good dude.\n- [Lex] Incredible person. And your conversation with Jack Barsky, he started talking to you about how his recruiters were\nfeeding back to him his own beliefs, his own\nopinions about himself, how smart he was, how good he was, how uniquely qualified he was. That's all pink matter manipulation. Feeding right back to the person, what they already think of themselves is a way to get them to\ninvest and trust you faster, because obviously you value\nthem for all the right reasons, because that's how they see themselves. So that loop that the\nKGB was using with Jack, Jack did not wake up to\nthat loop at the time. He woke up to it later. So\nit happens to all of us. We're all in a loop. It's just, whether it's about oat milk or whether it's about aliens or whether it's about, you\nknow, the Democrats trying to take your guns, whatever\nit is, everybody's in a loop. And we've gotta wake up to ask ourselves, just like you said, is it true or do we just really want it to be true? And until you ask yourself that question, you're just one of the\nmasses trapped in the loop. - That's the Nietzsche\ngaze into the abyss. It's a dangerous thing, hat's the past insanity\nis to ask that question. You wanna be doing it carefully, but it's also the place\nwhere you can truly discover something fundamental about this world that people don't understand and lay the groundwork\nfor progress, scientific, cultural, all that kind of stuff."

      "section": "Spy tricks",
      "text": "\"What is one spy trick?\" This is from a Reddit that I really enjoy. What's one spy trick? And you're full of a million spy tricks. People should follow you.\nYou did an amazing podcast. You're just an amazing person. What is the one spy trick\nyou would teach everyone that they can use to improve\ntheir life instantly? Now, you already mentioned quite a few, but what else could jump to mind? - My go-to answer for\nthis is not really changed much over the last few years. So the first, the most important spy trick to change everything\nimmediately is something called perception versus perspective. We all look at the world\nthrough our own perception. My dad used to tell me,\nmy stepdad used to tell me that perception is reality. And I was arguing this with him when I was 14 years old, \"I told you so, dad, you're still wrong.\" But perception is your interpretation of the world around you. But it's unique only to you. There's no advantage in your perception. That's why so many people\nfind themselves arguing all the time trying to\nconvince other people of their own perception. The way that you win any argument, the way that you get ahead in your career, the way that you outsell\nor out race anybody, is when you move off of perception and move into perspective. Perspective is the act or the art of observing the\nworld from outside of yourself. Whether that's outside of yourself as like an entity just observing from a different point of view. Or even more powerful,\nyou sit in the shoes, you sit in the seat of\nthe person opposite you, and you think to yourself,\nwhat is their life like? What do they feel right now?\nYou know, are they comfortable? Are they uncomfortable? Are they afraid? Are they scared? What's the stressor that\nthey woke up to this morning? What's the stressor that they're gonna go to sleep with tonight? When you shift places and get\nout of your own perception and into someone else's perspective, now you're thinking like them, which is giving you an\ninformational advantage, but you know what they're all doing? Everyone else out there is\ntrapped in their own perception. Not thinking about a\ndifferent perspective. So immediately you have\nsuperior information, superior positioning,\nyou have an advantage that they don't have. And if you do that to your boss, if's gonna change your career. If you do that to your spouse, it's gonna change your marriage. If you do that to your kids, it's gonna change your family legacy because nobody else out there is doing it. - It's so interesting\nhow difficult empathy is for people and how powerful it is. Especially for like you said, the spouse, like intimacy. Like stepping outside of yourself and really putting yourself in the shoes of the other person, considering\nhow they see the world. I really enjoy that because how does that\nexactly lead to connection? I think when you start to understand the way the\nother person sees the world, you start to enjoy the\nworld through their eyes. And you start to be able to\nshare, in terms of intimacy, share the beauty they see together because you understand their perspective. And somehow you converge as well. Of course that allows you to gather information better\nand all that kind of stuff. And like that allows you\nto work together better, to share in all different kinds of ways. But for intimacy, that's\na really powerful thing. And also for actually, like\npeople you really disagree with or people on the internet\nyou disagree with and so on. I find empathy is such a powerful way to resolve any tensions there. Even like people like trolls or all that kind of stuff,\nI don't deride them. I just kind of put myself in their shoes and it becomes like an enjoyable comradery with that person. - So I wanna draw a pretty hard line between perspective and empathy. Because empathy is\nfrankly an overused term by people who don't really know what they're saying sometimes. I think you know what you're saying, but the vast majority\nof people listening... - I would argue that, but that's fine. - As soon as you say empathy,\nthey're gonna just be like, oh yeah, I know I've heard\nthis a thousand times. Empathy is about feeling\nwhat other people feel or understanding...\n- It's more about feeling would you say? - It's about feelings. It's about understanding\nsomeone else's feelings. Feeling, it's not the same as sympathy where you feel their feelings. Empathy is about recognizing\nthat they have feelings and recognizing that\ntheir feelings are valid. Perspective is more than just feelings. It's about the brain, it's\nabout the pink matter, on the left side and the\nright side of the brain. Yes, I care about feelings. And this goes directly to\nyour point about connection. Yes, I care about feelings, but I also care about objectives. What is your aspirational goal? What was it like to grow up\nas you, yeah, what was it like to experience this and how did this shape\nyour opinion on that? And you know, what is it\nthat you're going to do next? More than just feelings,\nactual tactical actions. And that becomes extremely\nvaluable in the operational world because if you can get\ninto someone's head, left brain and right\nbrain, feelings and logic, you can start anticipating what actions they're gonna take next. You can direct the actions\nthat they're going to take next because you're basically telling them the story that's in their own head. When it comes to relationships and personal connection,\nwe talked about it earlier, the thing that people want\nthe most is community. They want someone else\nwho understands them. They want to be with people.\nThey don't want to be alone. The more you practice perspective,\nempathy or no empathy, the more you just validate\nthat a person is there. I am in this time and space\nwith you in this moment. Feelings aside, right, that is powerful. That is intimate. And whether you're talking about lovers or whether you're talking\nabout a business exchange or whether you're talking\nabout collaborators in a crime, I'm here\nwith you, ride or die, let's do it. Right? That's powerful. - How much of what you've\nlearned in your role at the CIA transfer over to relationships,\nto business relationship, to other aspects of life? This is something you work closely with powerful people to help them out. What have you learned\nabout the commonalities, about the problems that people face? - Man, I would say about a solid 95% of what I learned at CIA carries\nover to the civilian world, that 5% that doesn't, it would carry over in a disaster, right? Knowing how to shoot on target with my non-dominant hand\nreally only has one purpose. It's not gonna happen day-to-day, right? Knowing how to do a dead\ndrop that isn't discoverable by the local police force isn't\ngonna be useful right now, but it could be useful in a disaster. But the 95% of stuff that's useful, it's all tied to the human condition. It's all tied to being able to understand what someone's thinking, understand what someone's\nfeeling, direct their thoughts, direct their emotions,\ndirect their thought process, win their attention, win their loyalty, win influence with\nthem, grow your network, grow your own circle of influence. I mean, all of that is\nimmensely, immensely valuable. As an example, the disguise\nthing that we talked about earlier, disguise in and\nof itself has mixed utility. If you're Brad Pitt and\nyou don't want anybody to know your Brad Pitt, you\nput on a level one disguise and that's great. Or maybe you call me and I walk you through a level two disguise\nso that you can go to Aruba and nobody's gonna know\nyou're in Aruba, right? Whatever it is. But even there with the\n5% that doesn't apply to everyday life, there's\nstill elements that do. For example, when a person\nlooks at a human being's face, the first place they look\nis the same part of the face as if they were reading a piece of paper. So in English, we start from the top left and we read left to right, top to bottom. So when an English\nspeaking person interacts with another person, the\nfirst thing they look at isn't their eyes, it's the upper left,\nfrom their point of view, corner of their face. They look there and the\ninformation they get is hair color, hair pattern, skin color, right? That's it, before they know\nanything else about the face. This is one of the reasons\nwhy somebody can look at you and then you ask them,\n\"What color are my eyes?\" I don't really remember. Because the way they read the face, they read it from left\nto right, top to bottom. So they're paying a lot of attention to the first few things they see, and then they're paying less attention as they go down the face. The same scrolling behavior\nthat you see on the internet. So when you understand that\nthrough the lens of disguise, it allows you to make a\nvery powerful disguise. The most important part\nof your disguise is here, if you're English speaking. Right here, if you're speaking\nsome foreign languages that read right to left, right? If it's Chinese, you know that they're gonna look from here down 'cause they read left down. - So it's so interesting. So yeah, knowing that really\nhelps you sort of configure the things in terms of\nphysical appearance. That's interesting.\n- Correct. Correct. So when it comes to\nhow to make a disguise, not so useful to the\nultra wealthy usually. But when it comes to how to read a face or more importantly how people\nare going to read your face, that's extremely important because now you know\nwhere to find the first signs of deception in a\nbaseline or anything else. - You mentioned that the\nidea of having privacy is one that we think we\ncan, but we really don't. Is it possible for maybe somebody like me or a regular person to\ndisappear from the grid? - Absolutely and it's not\nas hard as you might think. It's not convenient. Again, convenience and security. You can disappear tomorrow, right? I can walk you through\nthree steps right now that's gonna help you disappear tomorrow. But none of them are convenient. They're all extremely secure, right? The first thing you do is every piece of digital technology you\nhave that is connected to you in any way, is now dead. You just let the battery run out. - [Lex] forever.\n- Forever. You never touch it again.\nStarting at this moment. What you have to do is go\nout and acquire a new one. Realistically, you will not be able to acquire a new one in the\nUnited States by buying it because to do so, you would\ntie it to your credit card, you would tie it to a\nlocation, a time, a place, a registered name, whatever else. So you would have to acquire\nit essentially by theft or through the black market. So you would want something because you're gonna need\nthe advantage of technology without it being in your name. So you go out and you steal a phone or you steal a laptop, you\ndo whatever you have to do to make sure that you can\nget on with the password and whatever else that might be, As dirty or as clean\nas you want that to be, we're all morally flexible here. But now you have a technological device that you can work with,\nand then from there on, you're just doing whatever you have to do. Whether you're stealing\nevery step of the way or whether you run a massive con. Keep in mind that we often\ntalk about conmen and cons. Do you know the word that con\nis a root word for confidence. That's what a conman is. A conman is a confidence man. Just somebody who is so brazenly\nconfident that the people around them living in\ntheir own perception, not perspective and their perception, they're like, \"Well, this guy really knows what he's talking about, so\nI'm gonna do what he says.\" So you can run a massive con and that can take care of your\nfinances, that can take care of your lodging, whatever\namount, whatever else it is. You are whoever you\npresent yourself to be. So if you wanna be Bill for the afternoon, just go tell people your name is Bill. They're not gonna question you. - So the intelligence, the natural web of\nintelligence gathering systems we have in the United\nStates and in the world, are they going to believe\nfor long that your Bill? - Until you do something that\nmakes them think otherwise. If you are consistent, we talked about consistency\nbeing the superpower. If you are consistent, they\nwill think your Bill forever. - How difficult is that to do? - It's not convenient. It's quite difficult. - Does that like require training? - It does require training. - Because why do criminals\nalways get caught? - Because they stop being consistent. I never hesitate to admit this, but people tell me I should\nhesitate to admit it. So now I hesitate because of the guidance I've gotten to hesitate, right? I like criminals. I'm friends with a number of criminals because the only people\nwho get me like right away who get me, are criminals because we know what it's like to basically abandon all\nthe rules, do our own thing our own way, and watch the\nworld just keep turning. Most people are so stuck in the trap of normal thought and behavior that when I tell them, they just don't just go tell\npeople your name is Bill. Most people are gonna say,\n\"Psh, that's not gonna work.\" But a criminal will be like,\n\"Oh yeah, I did that once. I just told everybody my name is Nancy. I'm a dude and they still believe me.\" Criminals just get it, right? So what happens with criminals is they go to the school of hard knocks. They learn criminal behavior on the job. Spies go to school, we go to the best spy school in the world. We go to Langley's, the farm, right? What's known as Field\nTradecraft Course, FTC, in a covert location for\na covert period of time. And covert, covert, covert. So if anybody from CIA is watching, I'm not breaking any rules, it's all in Wikipedia, but\nit's not coming from me. But that's how we do it. They train us from a\nhundred years of experience in the best ways to carry\nout covert operations, which are all just criminal\nactivities overseas. We learn how to do it the right way so that we don't get caught. We learn how to be consistent. More importantly, we learn\nhow to create an operation that has a limited lifespan because the longer it lives,\nthe more at risk you are. So you want operations to be short, concise on the X, off the X,\nlimit your room for mistakes. Criminals, they default to wanting these long-term operations 'cause they don't wanna\nhave to recreate a new way to make money every 15 days. - You mentioned if anybody\nfrom the CIA is watching, so I've seen you talk about\nthe fact that sort of people that are currently working\nat the CIA would kind of look down at the people\nwho've left the CIA and they deride them. Especially if you go public, especially if there's a book\nand all that kind of stuff. Do you feel the pressure\nof that to be quiet, to not do something like this conversation that we're doing today? - I feel the silent\njudgment. That's very real. I feel it for myself and\nI feel it for my wife who doesn't appear on camera very often, but who's also former CIA,\nwe both feel the judgment. We know that right now, three\ndays after this is released, somebody's gonna send an email\non a closed network system inside CIA headquarters, and there's a bunch of people\nwho are gonna laugh at it. A bunch of people who are gonna say that, who knows what, it's\nnot gonna be good stuff. - A bunch of people you respect probably. - A bunch of people who I'm\ntrying to bring honor to, whether I know them or\nrespect them is irrelevant. These are people who are out\nthere doing the deed every day, and I wanna bring them honor, and I wanna do that in a\nway that I get to share what they can't share and what they won't share when they leave, because they will also\nfeel the silent pressure, the pressure, the shame,\nthe judgment, right? But the truth is that I've\ndone this now long enough. The first few times that\nI spoke out publicly, the response to being a positive voice for what the sacrifices\nthat people are making, it's so refreshing to be an honest voice that people don't normally hear that it's too important. One day I'm gonna be gone and my kids are gonna\nlook back on all this and they're gonna see their dad trying to do the right thing\nfor the right reasons. And even if my son or\ndaughter ends up at CIA and even if they get ridiculed for being, \"Oh, you're the Bustamante kid, right? Your dad's a total sellout.\" Whatever it might be. Like, I want them to know,\nyou know, dad was doing what he could to bring\nhonor to the organization even when he couldn't stay\nin the organization anymore. - So you said when you were 27, I think,"

      "text": "you didn't know what\nthe hell you're doing. So now that you're a few\nyears older and wiser, let me ask you to put\non your wise sage hat and give advice to other 27 year olds or even younger, 17, 18 year olds that are just outta high\nschool, maybe going to college, trying to figure out this life, this career thing that they're on. What advice would you give\nthem about how to have a career or how to have a life\nthey can be proud of? - That's a powerful question, man. - [Lex] Have you figured\nit out yet yourself? - No, I'm a grand total\nof seven days smarter than I was at 27. Not a good average. - [Lex] Progress.\n(both laughing) - There's still time.\n- There's still time. So for all the young people\nout there deciding what to do, I would just say the same thing that I do say, and I\nwill say to my own kids, you only have one life. You only have one chance. If you spend it doing what\nother people expect you to do, you will wake up to your\nregret at some point. I woke up when I was 38 years old. My wife, in many ways\nis still waking up to it as she watches her grandparents pass and an older generation pass away. The folks that really have a blessed life are the people who learn early on to live with their own rules, live their own way, and live every day as\nif it's the last day. Not necessarily to waste it\nby being wasteful or silly, but to recognize that today\nis a day to be productive and constructive for yourself. If you don't want a\ncareer, today's not the day to start pursuing a career just because someone else told you to do it. If you wanna learn a language,\ntoday's the day to find a way to buy a ticket to another country and learn through immersion. If you want a date, if\nyou wanna get married, if you want a business, today\nis the day to just go out and take one step in that direction. And as long as every day,\nyou just make one new step, just like CIA recruited\nme, just do the next thing. If the step seems like it's too big, then there's probably two other steps that you can do before that. Just make constant\nprogress, build momentum, move forward and live on your own terms. That way you don't ever\nwake up to the regret. - And it'll be over before you know it. - Whether you regret it or not, it's true. - What do you think is the\nmeaning of this whole thing? What's the meaning of life? - Self-respect. That's a fast answer. There's a story behind\nit, if you want the story. - I would love to have the story. - There's a covert training\nbase in Alabama in the south and far south in like\nthe Armpit of America, where elite tier one operators go to learn human intelligence stuff. And there's a bar inside this base. And on the wall it's scribbles of opinions. And the question in the\nmiddle of the wall says, \"What's the meaning of life?\" And all these elite operators\nover the last 25 or 30 years, they all go, they get drunk\nand they scribble their answer and they circle it with a Sharpie, right? Love, family, America\nFreedom, right, whatever. And then the only thing they have to do is if they're gonna\nwrite something on there, they have to connect it with\nsomething else on the wall, at least one other thing. So if they write love, they can't just leave it floating there. They have to write love in a little bubble and connect it to something else, connect it to family, whatever else. When you look at that wall, the word self-respect is on the wall and it's got a circle around it, and then you can't see any other word because of all the things\nthat connect to self-respect. Just dozens of people have written over, have written their words\ndown and been drawn and scribbled over\nbecause of all the lines that connect self-respect. So what's the meaning of life? From my point of view, I've\nnever seen a better answer. It's all self-respect. If you don't respect yourself, how can you do anything else? How can you love someone else if you don't have self-respect? How can you build a\nbusiness you're proud of if you don't have self-respect? How can you raise kids? How\ncan you make a difference? How can you pioneer anything? How can you just wake up and have a good day if you\ndon't have self-respect? - The power of the individual. That's what makes this country great. I have to say, after traveling\nquite a bit in Europe and especially in a\nplace of war, coming back to the United States\nmakes me really appreciate about the better angels of this nation, the ideals it stands for,\nthe values it stands for. And I'd like, like to thank\nyou for serving this nation for time and humanity for time, and for being brave enough and bold enough to still talk about it and to inspire others, to educate others, for having many amazing conversations and for honoring me by having\nthis conversation today. You're an amazing human. Thanks so much for talking today. - Lex, I appreciate the\ninvite, man, and it was a joy. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Andrew Bustamante.

  "full_text": "- Mossad will do anything. Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes to ensure the survival\nof every Israeli citizen around the world. Most other countries\nwill stop at some point, but Mossad doesn't do that. - The following is a conversation\nwith Andrew Bustamante, former CIA Covert Intelligence Officer and US Air Force Combat veteran, including the job of\noperational targeting, encrypted communications\nand launch operations for 200 nuclear intercontinental\nballistic missiles. Andrew's over seven years as a CIA spy, have given him a skillset and a perspective on the world that is fascinating to explore. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Andrew Bustamante. The Central Intelligence Agency was formed almost 75 years ago. What is the mission of\nthe CIA? How does it work? - The mission of the CIA\nis to collect intelligence from around the world that supports a national security mission and be the central repository for all other intelligence agencies. So that it's one collective source where all intelligence can be synthesized and then passed forward\nto the decision-makers. - That doesn't include\ndomestic intelligence, it's primarily looking outward\noutside the United States. - Correct, CIA is the Foreign\nIntelligence Collection. King spoke if you will. FBI does domestic and then Department of Homeland\nSecurity does domestic, law enforcement essentially\nhandles all things domestic. Intelligence is not law enforcement, so we technically cannot work\ninside the United States. - Is there clear lines\nto be drawn between, like you just said, the CIA, FBI and the other US intelligence\nagencies like the DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, Department of Homeland Security, NSA, National Security Agency. And there's a list... - There's a list of about 33 different intelligence organizations. - It's like the army, the Navy has it. All the different organizations have their own intelligence groups. So is there clear lines here to be drawn or is the CIA the giant\nintegrator of all of these? - It's a little bit of both, to be honest. So yes, there are absolutely lines. And more so than the lines,\nthere are lines that divide what our primary mission is. Everything's gotta be prioritized. That's one of the benefits\nand the superpowers of the United States, is we prioritize everything. So different intelligence\norganizations are prioritized to collect certain types of intelligence. And then within the confines\nof how they collect, they're also given unique authorities. Authorities are a term that's directed by the executive branch. Different agencies have\ndifferent authorities to execute missions in different ways. FBI can't execute the\nsame way CIA executes and CIA can't execute the\nsame way NGA executes. But then at the end, excuse\nme, when it's all collected, then yes, CIA still acts as a final synthesizing\nrepository to create what's known as the\nPresident's daily brief. The PDB, the only way\nCIA can create the PDB is by being the single source\nof all source intelligence from around the IC, the\nintelligence community, which are those 30 some odd and always changing\norganizations that are sponsored for intelligence operations. - What does the PDB, the\nPresident's Daily Brief look like? How long is it? What does it contain? - So, first of all, it looks like the most expensive book report\nyou can ever imagine. It's got its own binder.\nIt's all very high end. It feels important. It looks important. It's not like a cheap trapper keeper. It's somewhere between,\nI would give it probably between 50 and 125 pages a day. It's produced every day around\ntwo o'clock in the morning by a dedicated group of analysts. And each page is essentially\na short paragraph to a few paragraphs about\na priority happening that affects national security\nfrom around the world. The president rarely gets to\nthe entire briefing in a day. He relies on a briefer\ninstead to prioritize what inside the briefing needs to\nbe shared with the president. 'Cause some days the PDB will\nget briefed in 10 minutes and some days it'll be briefed\nover the course of two hours. It depends on the president's schedule. - How much competition is\nthere for the first page. And so how much jockeying\nthere is for attention for, I imagine for all the\ndifferent intelligence agencies and within the CIA, there's\nprobably different groups that are modular and\nthey're all care about different nations or different cases. And do you understand how much competition\nthere is for the attention for the limited attention\nof the president? - You're 100% correct in how the agency and how officers and managers\nat the agency handle the PDB. There's a ton of competition. Everybody wants to be\nthe first on the radar. Everybody wants to be on the first page. The thing that we're not\nbaking into the equation is the president's interests. The president dictates what's\non the first page of his PDB and he will tell them,\nusually the day before, I wanna see this on the\nfirst page tomorrow, bring this to me in the beginning. I don't want to hear about what's happening in Mozambique. I don't really care about what's\nhappening in Saudi Arabia. I wanna see one, two, three. And regardless of whether or not those are the three biggest things in the world, the president's the executive. He's the one, he's the ultimate customer. So we do what the customer says. That has backfired in the past, if you haven't already started seeing how that could go wrong, that\nhas backfired in the past. But that is essentially\nwhat happens when you serve in the executive branch. You serve the executive. - So what's the role,\nthe director of the CIA versus the president? What's that dance like? So the president really\nleads the focus of the CIA? - The president is the\ncommander-in-chief for the military. But the executive, the president is also the executive for the entirety of the intelligence community. So he's the ultimate customer. If you look at it like a\nbusiness, the customer, the person spending the\nmoney is the president and the director is the CEO. So if the director doesn't create what the president wants,\nthere's gonna be a new director. That's why the director of CIA is a presidential appointed position. Sometimes they're extremely qualified intelligence professionals. Sometimes they're just\nprofessional politicians or soldiers that get put into that seat because the president trusts them to do what he wants them to do. Another gaping area that causes problems. But that's still the way it is. - So you think this is a\nproblematic configuration of the whole system? - Massive flaw in the system. It is a massive flaw in the system because if you're essentially\nappointing a director to do what you want them to do,\nthen you're assigning a crony. And that's what we define corruption as within the United States. And inside the United States, we say if you pick\nsomebody outside of merit for any other reason other\nthan merit, then it's cronyism or it's nepotism. Here that's exactly what\nour structure's built on. All presidential appointees are appointed on something other than merit. - So for an intelligence\nagency to be effective, it has to discover the truth\nand communicate that truth. And maybe if you're appointing\nthe director of that agency, they're less likely to\ncommunicate the truth to you unless the truth aligns perfectly with your desired worldview. - Well, not necessarily perfectly, because there are other steps, right? They have to go in front of Congress and they have to have the support of multiple legislatures or legislators. But the challenge is that\nthe shortlist of people who even get the opportunity aren't a meritorious list. It's a short list based off of\nwho the president is picking or who the would be president is picking. Now I think we've proven that an intelligence organization\ncan be extremely effective even within the flawed system. The challenge is how much more effective\ncould we be if we improved? And I think that's the\nchallenge that faces a lot of the US government. I think that's a challenge\nthat has resulted in what we see today when\nit comes to the decline of American power and American influence, the rise of foreign influence, authoritarian powers and\na shrinking US economy. A growing Chinese economy. And it's just, we have\nquestions, hard questions we need to ask ourselves about how we're gonna handle the future. - What aspect of that\ncommunication between the president and the CIA could be fixed to help fix the problems that you're referring to in terms of the decline of American power. - So when you talk about the\npresident wanting to prioritize what the president cares\nabout, that immediately shows a break between what actually matters to the long-term success\nof the United States versus what benefits\nthe short-term success of the current president. - Because any president\nis just a human being and has a very narrow focus. And narrow focus is not\na long-term calculation. - Exactly, what's the\nmaximum amount of years a president can be president? Eight, he or she... - In the United States. - In the United States according to our current constitution. (Andrew laughing) But they're very limited in terms of what they have to prioritize. And then if you look at a four year cycle, two years of that is essentially preparing for the next election cycle. So what's only two years\nof really quality attention you get from the president, who's the chief executive of\nall the intelligence community. So the most important thing to them is not always the most important thing to the long-term survival\nof the United States. - What do you make of\nthe hostile relationship that to me at least stands\nout of the presidents between Donald Trump and the CIA? Was that a very kind of\na personal bickering? I mean, is there something\ninteresting to you about the dynamics between\nthat particular president and that particular instantiation of the intelligence agency? - Man, there were lots of\nthings fascinating to me about that relationship, so first... - What's the good and the\nbad? Sorry to interrupt. - So lemme start with the good first 'cause there's a lot of people who don't think there was any good. So the good thing is, we\nsaw that the president, who's the chief customer,\nthe executive to the CIA, when the president doesn't\nwant to hear what CIA has to say, he's not gonna listen. I think that's an important\nlesson for everyone to take home. If the president doesn't\ncare what you have to say, he's gonna take funding away,\nor she will take funding away. They're gonna take attention away. They're going to shut down your operations, your missions. They're gonna kill the careers\nof the people working there. Think about that, for the four years that President Trump was the president, basically everybody at CIA,\ntheir career was put on pause. Some people's careers were ended, some people voluntarily\nleft their career there because they found themselves\nworking for a single customer that didn't want what they had to produce. - So for people who don't know, Donald Trump did not display significant deep interest in the output. - [Andrew] He did not trust it, yeah. - He was a disinterested\ncustomer of the information. - Exactly right, and then what do disinterested customers do? They go find someone else\nto create their product. And that's exactly what Donald Trump did. And he did it through the\nprivate intelligence world, funding private intelligence companies to run their own operations that brought him the\ninformation he cared about when CIA wouldn't. It also didn't help\nthat CIA stepped outside of their confines, right? CIA is supposed to collect\nforeign intelligence and not comment on domestic matters. They went way outside of that when they started\nchallenging the president, when they started questioning\nthe results, when they started publicly claiming Russian influence. That's all something the FBI\ncould have handled by itself, the Justice Department could\nhave handled by itself. CIA had no place to contribute\nto that conversation. And when they did, all\nthey did was undermine the relationship they had\nwith their primary customer. - Let me sort of focus\nin on this relationship between the president or the leader and the intelligence agency and look outside the United States. It seems like authoritarian regimes or regimes throughout history, if you look at Stalin and\nHitler, if you look at today with Vladimir Putin, the negative effects of power corrupting the mind of a leader manifest itself is that they start to get bad information from\nthe intelligence agencies. So this kind of thing\nthat you're talking about, over time, they start hearing information they want to hear. The agency starts producing\nonly the kind of information they want to hear. And the leader's worldview\nstarts becoming distorted to where the propaganda\nthey generate is also the thing that the intelligence\nagencies provide to them. And so they start believing\ntheir own propaganda and they start getting\ndistorted view of the world. Sorry for the sort of walking\nthrough in a weird way. But I guess I want to ask, do you think, let's look at Vladimir Putin specifically. Do you think he's getting\naccurate information about the world? Do you think he knows\nthe truth of the world? Whether that's the war in Ukraine, whether that's the behavior\nof the other nations in NATO, the United States in general. What do you think? - It's rare that I'll\ntalk about just thinking, I prefer to share my assessment. Why I assess things a\ncertain way rather than just what's my random opinion. And my assessment,\nVladimir Putin is winning. Russia is winning. They're winning in Ukraine, but they're also winning\nthe battle of influence against the West. They're winning in the\nface of economic sanctions. They're winning empirically. When you look at the\nmath, they're winning. So when you ask me whether or not Putin is getting good information for his intelligence services, when I look at my overall assessment of multiple data points, he must be getting good information. Do I know how or why? I do not. I don't know how or why it works there. I don't know how such deep cronyism, such deep corruption can possibly yield true real results. And yet somehow there are\nreal results happening. So it's either excessive\nwaste and an accidental win, or there really is a system and a process there that's functioning. - So this winning idea\nis very interesting. In what way, short term and\nlong term, is Russia winning? Some people say there was a miscalculation of the way the invasion happened. There was an assumption\nthat you would be able to successfully take Kiev. You'd be able to successfully\ncapture the east, the south, and the north of Ukraine. And with what now appears to be significantly insufficient\ntroops spread way too thin across way too large of a front. So that seems to be like\nan intelligence failure. And that doesn't seem to be like winning. In another way, it\ndoesn't seem like winning if we put aside the human cost of war, it doesn't seem like\nwinning because the hearts and minds of the West were completely on the side of Ukraine. This particular leader in Vladi Zelensky captured the attention of\nthe world and the hearts and minds of Europe, the West and many other nations\nthroughout the world, both financially in terms\nof military equipment and in terms of sort\nof social and cultural and emotional support for the independence fight of this nation. That seems to be like a miscalculation. So against that pushback, why do you think there's still kernels of winning in this on the Russian side? - What you're laying out isn't incorrect and the miscalculations\nare not unexpected. Anybody who's been to a military college, including the Army War\nCollege in Pennsylvania, where so many of our military\nleaders are brought up. When you look at the conflict in Ukraine, it fits the exact mold of what an effective long-term military conflict, protracted military conflict would and should look like\nfor military dominance. Now, did Zelensky and did the\nUkrainians shock the world? Absolutely, but in that they also shocked American intelligence, which like you said, miscalculated. The whole world, miscalculated how the Ukrainians would respond. Putin did not move in there accidentally. He had an assessment. He had high likelihood\nof a certain outcome, and that outcome did not happen. Why did he have that calculation?\nBecause in 2014 it worked. He took Crimean in 14 days. He basically created an infiltration campaign that turned key leaders\nover in the first few days of the conflict. So essentially there was no conflict. It worked in 2008 when he took Georgia, nobody talks about that. He invaded Georgia the exact\nsame way. And it worked. So in 2008 it worked. In 2014, it worked. There was no reason to believe it wasn't going to work again. So he just carried out the same campaign. But this time something was different. That was a miscalculation for\nsure on the part of Putin. And the reason that there\nwas no support from the West 'cause let's not forget,\nthere is no support. There is nothing other\nthan the Lend-Lease Act, which is putting Ukraine in massive debt right now to the West. That's the only form of support\nthey're getting from NATO or the United States. So if somebody believed Ukraine would win, if somebody believed Ukraine had a chance, they would've gotten more\nmaterial support than just debt. And we can jump into\nthat anytime you want to. But the whole world miscalculated. Everybody thought Russia\nwas gonna win in 14 days. I said that they would win in 14 days 'cause that was the\npredominant calculation. Once the first invasion didn't\nwork, then the military does what professional militaries\ndo, man, they reevaluate, they reorganize leaders and then they take a new approach. You saw three approaches.\nThe first two did not work. The first two campaigns\nagainst Ukraine did not work the way they were supposed to work. The third has worked exactly\nlike it's supposed to work. You don't need Kiev to win Ukraine. You don't need hearts\nand minds to win Ukraine. - [Lev] What's the third? - Yeah, what you need is\ncontrol of natural resources, which they're taking in the East. And you need access to the heartbeat, the blood flow of food and\nmoney into the country, which they're taking in the South. The fact that Ukraine had to\ngo to the negotiation table with Russia and Turkey\nin order to get exports out of the Black Sea, approved\nagain, demonstrates just how much Ukraine is losing. The aggressor had a seat\nat the negotiation table to allow Ukraine the ability to even export one of its top exports. If Russia would've said no, then they would not have had that. That's like someone holding your throat. It's like somebody\nholding your jugular vein and saying, \"If you don't\ndo what I tell you to do, then I'm not gonna let you breathe. I'm not gonna let blood\nflow to your brain.\" - So do you think it's\npossible that Russia takes the south of Ukraine? So starting from Mariupol,\nthe Haisyn region, - All the way to Odessa. - [Lex] All the way to Odessa - And into Moldova. I believe all of that will\nhappen before the fall. - Fall of this year?\n- Fall of this year. Before winter hits Europe, NATO wants, Germany needs to be able to have sanctions lifted so\nthey can tap into Russian power. There's no way they can\nhave those sanctions lifted unless Russia wins. And Russia also knows that all of Europe, all of NATO is the true people\nfeeling the pain of the war outside of Ukraine are the NATO countries because they're so\nheavily reliant on Russia. And as they have supported\nAmerican sanctions against Russia, their people feel\nthe pain economically, their people feel the pain. What are they gonna do in the winter? Because without Russian gas, their people are gonna freeze to death. - [Lex] Ukrainian people?\n- People all over NATO. Ukraine, everybody knows\nUkrainians at risk. Everybody knows Ukrainians are dying. The game of war isn't even played majoratively by the people who are fighting. The game of war is\nplayed by everyone else. It's an economic game.\nIt's not a military game. - [Lex] The flow of\nresources and energy, food - Attention, exactly right. - I was on the front in the\nHaisyn region, this very area that you're referring to, and\nI spoke to a lot of people and the morale is incredibly high. And I don't think the\npeople in that region, soldiers, volunteer soldiers, civilians, are going to give up\nthat land without dying. - I agree with you. - I mean, in order to take Odessa would require huge amount of artillery and slaughter of civilians, essentially. - They're not gonna\nuse artillery in Odessa because Odessa is too\nimportant to Russian culture. It's gonna be even uglier than that. It's going to be clearing of\nstreets, clearing of buildings, person by person, troop by troop. It'll be a lot like\nwhat it was in Mariupol. - [Lex] Just shooting at civilians. - Because they can't afford\nto just do bombing raids because they're gonna\ndestroy cultural significant architecture that's just too important to the Russian culture. And that's gonna demoralize\ntheir own Russian people. - I have to do a lot of\nthinking to try to understand what I even feel, I don't know. But in terms of information, the thing that the soldiers are saying, the Russian soldiers are saying, the thing the Russian\nsoldiers really believe is that they're freeing, they're liberating the\nUkrainian people from Nazis. And they believe this because I visited Ukrainian,\nI spoke to the over a hundred, probably a couple hundred Ukrainian people from different walks of life. It feels like the\nRussian soldiers at least aren't under a cloud of propaganda. They're not operating on a\nclear view of the whole world. And given all that, I just don't see Russia taking the south without committing war crimes. And if Vladimir Putin is\naware of what's happening in terms of the treatment of civilians, I don't see him pushing\nforward all the way to take the south, because that's not going\nto be effective strategy for him to win the hearts\nand minds of his people. - Autocracies don't need\nto win hearts and minds. That's a staunchly\ndemocratic point of view. Hearts and minds mean\nvery little to people who understand core basic needs and true power. You don't see Xi Jinping worrying about hearts and minds in China. You don't see it in North Korea, you don't see it in Congo, you don't see it in most of the world. Hearts and minds are a luxury. In reality, what people\nneed is food, water, power. They need income to be\nable to secure a lifestyle. It is absolutely sad. I am not in any way, shape or form saying that my assessment on this is enriching or enlightening or hopeful. It's just fact. It's just calculatable empirical evidence. If Putin loses in Ukraine, the losses, the influential losses, the\neconomic losses, the lives lost, the power lost is too great. So it is better for him to push and push and push through war crimes,\nthrough everything else. War crimes are something defined by the International Court system. The International Court system has Russia as part of its board. And the international court\nsystem is largely powerless when it comes to enforcing\nits own outcomes. So the real risk gain\nscenario here for Russia is significantly in\nfavor of gain over risk. The other thing that I think is important to talk about is everybody\nis trapped in the middle of a gigantic information war. Yes, there's battlefield\nbullets and cannons and tanks, but there's also a\nmassive informational war. The same narrative that you see these\nground troops in Ukraine, these Russian ground\ntroops in Ukraine believing they're clearing the land of Nazis. That information is being fed to them from their own home country. I don't know why people seem\nto think that the information that they're reading in English\nis any more or less true. Every piece of news coming outta the West, every piece of information coming out in the English language\nis also a giant narrative being shared intentionally to\ntry to undermine the morale and the faithfulness of\nEnglish speaking Russians, which somebody somewhere knows exactly how many of those there are. So we have to recognize that we're not getting true\ninformation from other side because there is a strategic\nvalue in making sure that there is just the\nright amount of miss or disinformation out there. Not because someone's\ntrying to lie to Americans, but because someone is trying to influence the way English\nspeaking Russians think. And in that world, that's\nexactly why you see so many news articles\ncited to anonymous sources, government officials who\ndo not wanna be named. There's nothing that links back\nresponsibility there, right? There's nothing that\ncan go to court there. But the information still gets released and that's enough to\nmake Ukrainians believe that the United States is gonna help them, or that the West is gonna help them. It's enough to make Russians think that they're going to lose. And maybe they should just give up now and leave from the battlefield now. We have to understand we are in the middle of a giant information war. - Maybe you can correct me, but it feels like in the\nEnglish speaking world, it's harder to control,\nit's harder to fight the information war because of, you know, some people say there's not\nreally a freedom of speech in this country. But I think if you compare, there's a lot more freedom of speech and it's just harder to control narratives when there's a bunch of gorilla\njournalists that are able to just publish anything they\nwant on Twitter or anything. It's just harder to control narratives. - So people don't understand\nwhere freedom of speech is. That's the first major problem. And it's shameful how many people in the United\nStates do not understand what freedom of speech actually protects. So that aside, you're absolutely right. Fighting the information\nwar in the West is extremely difficult because anyone with a blog, anyone with a Twitter account, I mean, anyone can call themselves\na journalist essentially. We live in a world, we live in a country where people read the headline and they completely bypass the author line and they go straight into the content and then they decide whether\nthe content's real or not, based on how they feel instead of based on empirical,\nmeasurable evidence. - So you mentioned the Lend-Lease Act and the support of the United States, support of Ukraine by the United States. Are you skeptical to the level of support that the United States is providing and is going to provide over time? - The strategy that the\nUnited States has taken to support Ukraine is similar\nto the strategy we took to support Great Britain\nduring World War II. The enactment of the Lend-Lease Act is a perfect example of that. The Lend-Lease Act means\nthat we are lending or leasing equipment to\nthe Ukrainian government in exchange for future payment. So every time a rocket is launched, every time a drone crashes into a tank, that's a bill that Ukraine\nis just racking up. It's like when you go to a restaurant and you start drinking shots, sometime the bill will come due. This is exactly what we did when Europe and when Great Britain was\nin the face of Nazi invasion. We signed the same thing into motion. Do you know that the UK\ndid not pay off the debt from World War II until 2020. They've been paying that debt\nsince the end of World War II. So what we're doing is\nwe're indebting Ukraine against the promise that perhaps they will\nsecure their freedom, which nobody seems to want to talk about what freedom is actually gonna look like for Ukrainians, right? What are the true handful of outcomes, the realistic outcomes\nthat could come of this, and which of those outcomes really looks like freedom to them, especially\nin the face of the fact that they're going to be\ntrillions of dollars in debt to the West for supplying\nthem with the training and the weapons and the\nfood and the med kits and everything else\nthat we're giving them. Because none of it's\nfree. It's all coming due. We're a democracy, but we're\nalso a capitalist country. We can't afford to just\ngive things away for free, but we can give things away at a discount. We can give things away layaway, but the bill will come due. And unfortunately, that is\nnot part of the conversation that's being had with the American people. - So debt is a way to establish\nsome level of control. - Power\n- Is power. That said, having a\nvery close relationship between Ukraine and the United\nStates does not seem to be a negative possibility\nwhen Ukrainians think about their future in terms of freedom. That's one thing. And the other, there's\nsome aspect of this war that I've just noticed that one of the people I talked to\nsaid that, \"All great nations have a independence\nwar\", have to have a war for their independence. There's something, it's dark, but there's something about\nwar just being a catalyst for finding your own identity as a nation. So you can have leaders,\nyou can have sort of signed documents, you can\nhave all this kind of stuff, but there's something about war that really brings the country together and actually try to figure\nout what is at the core of the spirit of the people\nthat defines this country. And they see this war as\nthat, as the independence war to define the heart of\nwhat the country is. So there's been, before the\nwar, before this invasion, there was a lot of\nfactions in the country. There was a lot of\ninfluence from oligarchs and corruption and so on. A lot of that was the\nfactions were brought together under one umbrella effectively\nto become one nation because of this invasion. So they see that as a positive direction for the defining of what a free democratic country looks like after the war, in their perspective, after the war is won. - It's a difficult situation because I'm trying to make sure that you and all everybody\nlistening understands that what's happening in Ukraine\namong Ukrainians is noble and brave and courageous and beyond the expectations of anyone. The fact is, there is no material support\ncoming from the outside. In the American Revolution was won because of French involvement. French ships, French\ntroops, French generals, French military might. The independence of communist China was won through Russian support. Russian generals, Russian\ntroops on the ground fighting with the communists. That's how revolutions are won. That's how independent countries are born. Ukraine doesn't get any of that there. No one is stepping into that because we live in a world right now where there simply is no economic benefits to the parties in power to\nsupport Ukraine to that level. And war is a game of economics. The economic benefit of Ukraine\nis crystal clear in favor of Russia, which is why Putin cannot lose. He will not let himself lose. Short of something\ncompletely unexpected, right? I'm talking 60%, 70%\nprobability Ukraine loses, but there's still 20%, 30% probability of the unimaginable happening. Who knows what that might be. And oligarch assassinates Putin or a nuclear bomb goes off somewhere or who knows what, right? There's still a chance that\nsomething unexpected will happen and change the tide of the war. But when it comes down to\nthe core calculus here, Ukraine is the agricultural\nbed to support a future Russia. Russia knows, they know\nthey have to have Ukraine. They know that they have to have it to protect themselves against military pressure from the West. They have to have it for\nagricultural reasons. They have major oil on\nnatural gas pipelines that flow through Eastern Ukraine. They cannot let Ukraine fall outside of their sphere of influence, they cannot. The United States doesn't\nreally have any economic vested interest in Ukraine. You know, ideological points\nof view and promises aside, there's no economic benefit. And the same thing goes for NATO. NATO has no economic\ninvestments in Ukraine. Ukrainian output, Ukrainian food goes to the Middle East and Africa. It doesn't go to Europe. So the whole, the West siding with Ukraine is exclusively ideological and it's putting them in a place where they fight a war with Russia so the whole world can\nsee Russia's capabilities. Ukraine is a, as sad as it is to say, man, Ukraine is a pawn on a\ntable for superpowers to calculate each other's capacities. Right now we've only talked about Russia and the United States. We haven't even talked about Iran. We haven't even talked about China, right? It is a pawn on a table. This is a chicken fight so\nthat people get to watch and see what the other trainers are doing. - Well, a lot of people might\nhave said the same thing about the United States back\nin the independence fight. So there is possibilities, as you've said. We're not saying 0% chance, and it could be a reasonably\nhigh percent chance that this becomes one of\nthe great democratic nations that the 21st century is remembered by. - [Andrew] Absolutely.\n- And so you said American support, so\nideologically, first of all, you don't assign much\nlong-term power to that, that US could support Ukraine purely on ideological grounds. - Just look in the last four\nyears, the last three years, do you remember what happened in Hong Kong right before Covid? China swooped into Hong Kong\nviolently beating protesters, killing them in the street, imprisoning people without just cause. And Hong Kong was a democracy and the whole world stood\nby and let it happen. And then what happened in\nAfghanistan just a year ago? And the whole world stood by and let the Taliban take power\nagain after 20 years of loss. We are showing a repeatable point of view. We will talk American politicians,\nAmerican administrations, we will say a lot of things. We will promise a lot of\nideological pro-democracy, rah rah statements, we will say it. But when it comes down to\nputting our own people, our own economy, our own GDP at risk, we step away from that fight. - America is currently supplying military equipment to Ukraine.\n- [Andrew] Absolutely. - And a lot of that military equipment has actually been the thing\nthat turned the tides of war a couple of times already. Currently that's the HIMARS systems. So you mentioned sort of\nPutin can't afford to lose, but winning can look in different ways. So you've kind of defined\nso on, at this moment, the prediction is that winning\nlooks like capturing not just the east but the south of Ukraine, but you can have narratives\nof winning that returned back to the, what was it? The beginning of this\nyear before the invasion? That Crimea is still with Russia. There's some kind of\nnegotiated thing about Donbas where it still stays with the Ukraine, but it there's some...\n- Public government. Just like what they have\nin Georgia right now. - And that could still be\ndefined through mechanisms... - [Andrew] As Russia winning. - As Russia winning for Russia and then for Ukraine as Ukraine winning and for the West as democracy winning. And you kind of negotiate. I mean that seems to be\nhow geopolitics works, everybody can walk away\nwith a win-win story, and then the world progresses,\nwith lessons learned. - That's the high likely, that's\nthe most probable outcome. The most probable outcome\nis that Ukraine remains in air quotes, \"a sovereign nation\". It's not going to be truly sovereign because it will become, it will have to have new\ngovernment put in place. Zelensky will, it's extremely\nunlikely he will be president because he has gone too far to demonstrate his power over the people and his ability to separate\nthe Ukrainian people from the autocratic power of Russia. So he would have to be unseated. Whether he goes into exile or whether he is peacefully\nleft alone is all gonna be part of the negotiations. But the thing to keep in mind also is that a negotiated piece really just means a negotiated ceasefire. And we've seen this\nhappen all over the world. North Korea and South\nKorea are technically still just in negotiated cease fire. What you end up having is\nRussia will allow Ukraine to call itself Ukraine,\nto operate independently, to have their own debt\nto the United States. Russia doesn't wanna take on that debt. And then in exchange for that, they will have firmer guidelines as to how NATO can engage with Ukraine. And then that becomes an example for all the other former\nSoviet satellite states, which are all required\neconomically by Russia, not required economically by the West. And then you can see how the whole thing plays\nout once you realize that the keystone is Ukraine. - There is something about\nUkraine, the deep support by the Ukrainian people of\nAmerica that is in contrast with, for example, Afghanistan, that it seems like\nideologically Ukraine could be a beacon of freedom used in\nnarratives by the United States to fight geopolitical wars\nin that part of the world. That they would be a good\npartner for this idea of democracy, of freedom,\nof all the values that America stands for. They're a good partner and so it's valuable if\nyou sort of have a cynical, pragmatic view, sort of like\nHenry Kissinger type of view. It's valuable to have them\nas a partner, so valuable that it makes sense to\nsupport them in achieving a negotiated ceasefire that's\non the side of Ukraine. But because of this particular leader, this particular culture,\nthis particular dynamics of how the war unrolled\nand things like Twitter and the way digital\ncommunication currently works, it just seems like this is\na powerful symbol of freedom that's useful for the United States, if we're sort of to\ntake the pragmatic view. Don't you think it's possible that United States supports\nUkraine financially, militarily enough for it to\nget an advantage in this war? - I think they've already\ngot an advantage in the war. The fact that the war is\nstill going on demonstrates the asymmetrical advantage. The fact that Russia has stepped\nup to the negotiating table with them several times\nwithout just turning to, I mean, you remember what\nhappened in Chechnya, without turning to Chechnya level, just mass blind destruction,\nwhich was another Putin war. To see that those things\nhave happened demonstrates the asymmetric advantage\nthat the West has given. I think the true way to look\nat the benefit of Ukraine as a shining example of\nfreedom in Europe for the West isn't to understand\nwhether or not they could, they absolutely could. It's the question of how\nvaluable is that in Europe, how valuable is Ukraine? Which before February, nobody\neven thought about Ukraine. And the people who did\nknow about Ukraine knew that it was a extremely\ncorrupt, former Soviet state with 20% of its national population, self-identifying as Russian. There's a reason Putin went into Ukraine. There's a reason he's\nbeen promising he would go into Ukraine for the\nbetter part of a decade because the circumstances were aligned. It was a corrupt country\nthat self-identified as Russian in many ways. It was supposed to be an\neasier of multiple marks in terms of the former Soviet\nsatellite states to go after. That's all part of the miscalculation that the rest of the world saw too, when we thought it would fall quickly. So to think that it could be\na shining example of freedom is accurate, but is it as\nshining a star as Germany? Is it as shining a star as the UK? Is it as shining a star as Romania? Is it as shiny a star as France? Like it's got a lot of democratic freedom based countries in Europe\nto compete against, to be the shining stellar example. And in exchange on counterpoint to that, it has an extreme amount of\nstrategic value to Russia, which has no interest in\nmaking it a shining star of the example of democracy and freedom. - Outside of resource, in terms of the shininess of\nthe star, I would argue yes. If you look at how much it captivated the attention of the world. - The attention of the world has made no material difference, man,\nthat's what I'm saying. - That's your estimation, but are you sure we can't... If you can convert that\ninto political influence, into money, don't you\nthink attention is money? - Attention is money in democracies and capitalist countries, yes. - Which serves as a counterweight to sort of authoritarian regimes. So for Putin resources matter, for the United States\nalso resources matter, but the attention and the\nbelief of the people also matter because that's how you attain\nand maintain political power. - So going to that exact\nexample, then I would highlight that our current\nadministration has the lowest approval ratings of president in history. So if people were very fond of\nthe war going on in Ukraine, wouldn't that counterbalance\nsome of our upset, some of the dissent\ncoming from the economy and some of the dissent coming\nfrom the Great Recession or the great resignation and whatever's happening\nwith the down stock market, you would think that people would feel like they're\nsacrificing for something. If they really believed\nthat Ukraine mattered, that they would stand\nnext to the president who is so staunchly driving and leading the West\nagainst this conflict? - Well, I think the opposition\nto this particular president, I personally believe has\nless to do with the policies and more to do with a lot\nof the other human factors. - But again, empirically\nthis is, I look at things through a very empirical lens, a very cold fact-based lens. And there are multiple\ndata points that suggest that the American people\nideologically sympathize with Ukraine, but they really just want their gas prices to go down. They really just want to be able to pay less money at the\ngrocery store for their food. And they most definitely\ndon't want their sons and daughters to die in\nexchange for Ukrainian freedom. - It does hurt me to see the politicization of this war as well. I think that's maybe has to do\nwith the kind of calculation you're referring to, but it seems like it doesn't. It seems like there's a cynical\nwhatever takes attention of the media for the moment. The the red team chooses one side and the blue team chooses another. And then I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the Democrats\nwent into full like support of Ukraine on the idealogical side. And then I guess republicans are saying, \"Why are we wasting money? The gas prices are growing up.\" That's a very crude kind of analysis, but they basically\npicked whatever argument on whatever side. And now more and more and more, this particular war in Ukraine is becoming a kind of pawn in the game of politics. That's first the midterm\nelections then building up towards the presidential elections and stops being about the\nphilosophical, the social, the geopolitical aspects,\nparameters of this war and more about just like\nwhatever the heck captivates Twitter, and we're gonna\nuse that for politics. - You're right in the sense\nof the fact that it's, I wouldn't say that the red team and the blue team picked\nopposite sides on this. What I would say is that media discovered that talking about Ukraine\nwasn't as profitable as talking about something else. People simply, the American\npeople who read media or who watch media, they simply became\nbored reading about news that didn't seem to be changing much. And we turned back into wanting to read about our own economy and we wanted to hear\nmore about cryptocurrency, and we wanted to hear more\nabout the Kardashians. And that's what we care about. So that's what media writes about. That's how a capitalist\nmarket-driven world works, and that's how the United States works. That's why in both red papers\nand blue papers, red sources and blue sources, you don't see Ukraine being mentioned very much. If anything, I would say that your Republicans are\nprobably more in support of what's happening in Ukraine right now because we're creating\nnew weapons systems, our military is getting stronger, we get to test military systems in combat in Ukraine, that's priceless. In the world of the\nmilitary industrial complex, being able to field test,\ncombat test a weapon without having to\nsacrifice your own people is incredibly valuable. You get all the data, you get\nall the performance metrics, but you don't have to\nput yourself at risk. That is one of the major benefits of what we're seeing from supporting Ukraine with weapons and with troops. The long-term benefit to\nwhat will come of this for the United States,\npractically speaking in the lens of national security\nthrough military readiness, through future economic\nbenefits, those are super strong. The geopolitical fight is essentially moot because Ukraine is not\na geopolitical player. It was not for 70 years. And after this conflict is\nover, it will not again. Just think about what\nyou were just saying, with the American people's\nattention span to Twitter and whatever's currently going on. If the Ukraine conflict\nresolved itself today in any direction, how\nmany weeks do you think before no one talked\nabout Ukraine anymore? Do you think we would make it two weeks or do you think we'd\nmake it maybe seven days? It would be headline\nnews for one or two days and then we'd be onto something else. It's just an unfortunate reality of how the world works in\na capitalist democracy. - Yeah, it just breaks my\nheart how much, you know, I know that there's Yemen and Syria and... - That nobody talks about anymore. Still raging conflicts going on. - It just breaks my heart how much generational hatred is born. I happen to be from, my\nfamily is from Ukraine and from Russia. And so for me, just personally,\nit's a part of the world I care about in terms of its history. Because I speak the language,\nI can appreciate the beauty of the literature, the music, the art, the cultural history of the 20th century through all the dark times,\nthrough all the hell of the dark sides of authoritarian regimes, the destruction of war, there is still just the beauty\nthat I'm able to appreciate that I can't appreciate about\nChina, Brazil, other countries because I don't speak their language. This one I can appreciate. And so in that way, this is\npersonally really painful to me to see so much of that history. The beauty in that history,\nsuffocated by the hatred that is born through this\nkind of geopolitical game, fought mostly by the\npoliticians, the leaders. - People are beautiful. And that's what you're talking about. People are beautiful creatures. Culture and art and science, like these are beautiful, beautiful things that come about because of human beings. And the thing that gives me hope is that no matter what conflict\nthe world has seen, and we've seen some devastating, horrible crimes against humanity already. We saw nuclear bombs go off in Japan. We saw genocide happen in Rwanda. We've seen horrible things\nhappen, but people persevere. Language, culture, arts,\nscience, they all persevere. They all shine through. People don't even realize how gorgeous the architecture and the culture is inside Iran. People have no idea. Chinese people in the rural parts of China are some of the kindest, most amazing people you'll ever meet. And Korean arts and Korean\ndance, Korean drumming, I know nobody has ever even\nheard of Korean drumming. Korean drumming is this\nmagical, beautiful thing. And the north, in North\nKorea does it better than anybody in the world. Taekwondo in North Korea is just exceptional to watch.\n- [Lex] in North Korea? In North Korea. Nobody knows these things. - How do you know about\nTaekwondo in North Korea? I have questions.\n(both laughing) That's fascinating, like,\npeople don't think about that, but the culture, the beauty of the people still flourishes even in\nthe toughest of places. - Absolutely and we always will. We always will because\nthat is what people do. And that is just the truth of it. And it breaks my heart to see travesties that people commit against people. But whether you're\nlooking at a micro level, like what happens with shootings\nhere in the United States, or whether you look at a macro level like geopolitical power exchanges and intra and interstate conflicts like what you see in Syria and what you see in Ukraine, those are disgusting, terrible things. \"War is a terrible thing.\" That is a famous quote, but people will persevere. People will come through. - I hope so. I hope so. And I hope we don't do something that I'll probably also ask\nyou about later on is things that destroy the\npossibility of perseverance, which is things like nuclear war, things that can do such tremendous damage that we will never recover. But yeah, amidst your pragmatic pessimism, (Andrew laughing) I think both you and\nI have a kind of maybe small flame of optimism in\nthere about the perseverance of the human species in general. Let me ask you about intelligence agencies outside of the CIA. Can you illuminate what is the most powerful\nintelligence agency in the world? The CIA, the FSB, formerly\nthe KGB, the MI6, Mossad. I've gotten a chance to\ninteract with a lot of Israelis while in Ukraine. Just incredible people in terms\nof both training and skills. Just all and every front. American soldiers too. Just American military is incredible. The competence and skill of the\nmilitary, the United States, Israeli, got to interact,\nand Ukrainian as well. - [Andrew] It's striking.\n- It's striking. It's beautiful, I just love\npeople, I love carpenters or people that are just\nextremely good at their job and they take pride in\ntheir craftsmanship. It's beautiful to see. And I imagine the same kind\nof thing happens inside of intelligence agencies\nas well that we don't get to appreciate because of the secrecy. Same thing with like Lockheed\nMartin, I interviewed the CTO of Lockheed Martin. It breaks my heart as a\nperson who loves engineering because of the cover of secrecy, we'll never get to know some\nof the incredible engineering that happens inside of\nLockheed Martin and Boeing... - [Andrew] Raytheon. - You know, there's kind of\nthis idea that these are, you know, people have conspiracy theories and they're kind of assign evil to these companies to some part. But I think there's beautiful\npeople inside those companies, brilliant people and\nsome incredible science and engineering is happening there. Anyway, that said the CIA, the FSB, the MI6, Mossad, China, I\nknow very little about the... - MSS Ministry of State Security. - I don't know how much you know, (both laughing) or just other intelligence\nagencies in India, Pakistan, I've also heard... - Yep, RAW is powerful.\nAnd so is ISS or ISSI. - And then of course European\nnations in Germany and France. Yeah, so what can you say about\nthe power of the influence of the different intelligence agencies within their nation and outside? - Yeah, so to answer your\nquestion, your original question, which is the most powerful, I'm gonna have to give you a few different answers. So the most powerful intelligence\norganization in the world in terms of reach is the Chinese MSS, the Ministry of State Security\nbecause they have created a single solitary intelligence\nservice that has global reach and is integrated with Chinese culture. So that essentially every Chinese person anywhere in the world is\nan informant to the MSS because that's their way of serving the middle kingdom jungle,\nthe central kingdom, the Chinese word for China. So they're the strongest, the most intelligence\nservice in terms of reach, most assets, most informants,\nmost intelligence. - So it is deeply\nintegrated with a citizenry? - Correct, with their culture. You know what, a Chinese person who lives in Syria thinks of themself as? A Chinese person. Do you know what a Chinese person, a Chinese national living\nin the United States thinks of themself as? A Chinese person, right? Americans living abroad often\nthink of ourselves as expats, expatriates, living on the local economy, embracing the local culture. That is not how Chinese people view traveling around the world. - And by the way, if I\nmay mention, I believe the way Mossad operates\nis similar kind of thing because people from Israel\nliving abroad still think of themselves as Jewish and Israeli first. So that allows you to integrate the... - Culture and yep, the faith-based\naspects. Exactly right. But the number of people in\nIsrael is much, much smaller than the number of people in China. - So when it comes to\nreach China wins that game. When it comes to professional\ncapability, it's the CIA by far because budget\nwise, capability wise, weapons system wise,\nmodern technology wise, CIA is the leader around the world, which is why every other\nintelligence organization out there wants to partner with CIA. They want to learn from CIA,\nthey want to train with CIA, they wanna partner on counter-narcotics and counter-drug and counter-terrorism and counter-Uyghur, you name it. People wanna partner with CIA. So CIA is the most powerful in terms of capability and wealth. And then you've got the\nidea, you've got tech. So tech alone, meaning\ncorporate espionage, economic espionage, nothing\nbeats DGSE in France, they're the top. They've got a massive budget\nthat almost goes exclusively to stealing foreign secrets. They're the biggest threat\nto the United States, even above Russia and above China. DGSE in France is a massively powerful intelligence organization, but they're so exclusively focused\non a handful of types of intelligence collection\nthat nobody even really thinks that they exist. And then in terms of\njust terrifying violence, you have Mossad. Mossad will do anything. Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes to ensure the survival of every Israeli citizen around the world. Most other countries\nwill stop at some point, but Mossad doesn't do that. - So it's the lines\nyou're willing to cross? - And the reasons that\nyou're willing to cross them. You know, the CIA will let\nan Americans stay in jail in Russia unlawfully and\nseek a diplomatic solution. I mean, the United States has let people, there are two gentlemen in from the 1950s who were imprisoned in China for 20 years waiting for diplomatic\nsolutions to their release. We do not kill to save a citizen. But Mossad will. - And then they'll not just kill, they'll like do large scale infiltration. - They do amazing things. They spare no expense because it's a demonstration\nto their own people. Again, going back to the\nwhole idea of influence, every intelligence operation\nthat sees the light of day has two purposes. The first purpose is the\nintelligence operation, but if it was just the\nintelligence operation, it would stay secret forever. The second purpose of every successful\nintelligence operation, when they become public, it's\nto send a signal to the world. If you work against us,\nwe will do this to you. If you work for us, we will\ntake care of you in this way. It's a massive information campaign. - Do you think in that way,\nCIA is not doing a good job? Because there's, you know, the\nFSB perhaps much less so GRU but the KGB did this well, which is to send a signal,\nlike basically communicate that this is a terrifying\norganization with a lot of power and Mossad is doing a good job of that. So this the psychological\ninformation warfare, and it seems like the CIA also has a lot of kind of myths about it, conspiracy theories about it, but much less so than the other agencies. - CIA does a good job of\nplaying to the mythos. So when General Petraeus used to be the director of CIA, 2000... - And your workout\npartner, I read about this. - [Andrew] And workout partner. - So I loved and hated\nthose workouts with Petraeus because he is a physical beast. He's a strong, fit at the time, 60 something year old man. - Let me take a tangent on that 'cause he's coming on this podcast. - Oh, excellent man.\n- So can you say what you've learned from\nthe man in terms of, or like what you think is\ninteresting and powerful and inspiring about the\nway he sees the world, or maybe what you learned\nin terms of how to get strong in the gym, or anything about life? - Two things right away. And one of 'em I was gonna\nshare with you anyway, so I'm glad that you asked the question. So the first is that on our runs, and man, he runs fast, and we would go for six\nmile runs through Bangkok. And he talked openly about, I asked him, \"How do you keep this mystery, this epic mythology about your fitness and your strength? How do you keep all of this\nalive with the troops?\" And he had this amazing answer and he was like, \"I don't talk about it.\" Myths are born not from\nsomebody orchestrating the myth, but from the source of the\nmyth, simply being secretive. So he's like, \"I don't talk\nabout it. I've never about it. I've never exacerbated it. I just do what I do and\nI let the troops talk.\" And he's like, \"When it\ngoes in favor of discipline and loyalty and commitment, I let it run. If it starts getting\ndestructive or damaging, then I have my leadership\nteam step into fix it.\" But when it comes to the mythos, the myth of him being\nsuperpowered soldier, that's what he wants every soldier to be. So he lets it run. And it was so enlightening\nwhen he told me, \"When there's a myth that\nbenefits you, you just let it go.\" You let it happen because\nit gets you further without you doing any work. It costs no investment for me. - So the catalyst of\nthe virality of the myth is just being mysterious. - And that's what CIA does well. To go back to your first\nquestion, what does CIA do? They don't answer any questions.\nThey don't say anything. And wherever the myth goes, the myth goes, whether it's that they sold\ndrugs or use child prostitutes or whatever else, wherever\nthe myth goes, they let it go. Because at the end of the\nday, everybody sits back and says, \"Wow, I really just don't know.\" Now the second thing that\nI learned from Petraeus, and I really am a big fan of Petraeus. I know he made personal mistakes. You don't get to be that powerful without making personal mistakes. But when I worked out with him, the one thing that my\ncommanding officer told me not to ask about, he was like, \"Never ask the general about his family.\" I'm a family guy. So as soon as I met General Petraeus, one of the first things I asked him was, \"Hey, what was it like raising a family and being the commander of\nforces in the Middle East? Like you weren't with\nyour family very much.\" And the thing I love about the guy, he didn't bite off my head. He didn't snap at me.\nHe didn't do anything. He openly admitted that he\nregretted some of the decisions that he made because he had to sacrifice his family to get there. Relationships with his children, absentee father, missing birthdays. We all say how sad it's to miss birthdays and miss anniversaries, yada, yada, yada. Everybody knows what that feels like. Even business people know\nwhat that feels like. The actual pain that we're talking about\nis when you're not there to handle your 13 year old's questions, when a boy breaks up with\nher or when you're not there to handle the bloody lip that\nyour 9-year-old comes back with from their first\nencounter with a bully. Those are the truly heartbreaking moments that a parent lives and dies by. He missed almost all of those because he was fighting\na war that we forgot and we gave up on 20 years later, right? He's so honest about that. And it was really inspiring to me to be told not to ask that question. And when I broke that guidance,\nhe didn't reprimand me. He was authentic. And it was absolutely\none of the big decisions that helped me leave\nCIA on my own in 2014. - And he was honest on\nthe sacrifice you make. - The same man who just taught me a lesson about letting a myth live. That same guy was willing to be so authentic about this personal mistake. - I like complicated people like that. (Andrew laughing) So what do you make of that calculation, of family versus job? You've given a lot of your life and passion to the CIA to that work. You spoken positively about that world the good it does. And yet you are also a family\nman and you value that. What's that calculation like? What's that trade off like? - I mean, for me the calculation\nis very clear. It's family. I left CIA because I chose my family. And when my son was born,\nmy wife and I found out that we were pregnant while\nwe were still on mission. We were a tandem couple. My wife is also a former CIA\nofficer undercover like me. We were operating together overseas. We got the positive pregnancy\ntests like so many people do. And she cried. My wife was a badass. I was like the accidental spy, but my wife was really\ngood at what she does. And she cried and she was\nlike, \"What do we do now?\" Like, it's what we've\nalways wanted, a child, but we're in this thing right now and like, there's no space for a child. So long story short, we had our baby, CIA brought us back to have the baby. And when we started having\nthe conversations about, \"Hey, what do we do next?\" 'Cause we're not the type of people to want to just sit\naround and be domestic. What do we do next? But keep in mind we have a child now, so here's some of our suggestions. We could do this and we can do that. Let us get our child to a place where we can put him into\nan international school. Or we can get him into\nsome sort of program where we can both operate together\nagain during the day. But CIA, they had no patience\nfor that conversation. There, family is not their priority. So the fact that we were a\ntandem couple, two officers, two operators trying to have\na baby was irrelevant to them. So when they didn't play with\nus, when they did nothing to help us prioritize parenthood as part of our overall experience, that's when we knew that they never would. And what good is it to commit yourself to a career if the career is always going to challenge the thing\nthat you value most? And that was the calculation\nthat we made to leave CIA. Not everybody makes that calculation. And a big part of why I am so\nvocal about my time at CIA is because I am immensely\nappreciative of the men and women who to this day have failed marriages and poor relationships with their children because they chose national security, they chose protecting\nover their own family. And they've done it even though\nit's made them a, you know, abuse alcohol and abuse substances and they've got permanent\npermanent diseases and issues from living and working abroad. It's just insane the\nsacrifice that officers make to keep America free. And I'm just not one of\nthose people. I chose family. - You said that your wife\nmisses it. Do you miss it? - We both miss it. We miss\nit for different reasons. We miss it for similar reasons, I guess, but we miss it in different ways. The people at CIA a are just amazing. They're everyday people like\nthe guy and the gal next door, but so smart and so dedicated and so courageous about what\nthey do and how they do it. I mean, the sacrifices\nthey make are massive, more massive than the sacrifices I made. So I was always inspired and impressed by the people around me. So both my wife and I\nabsolutely miss the people. My wife misses the work\nbecause you know everything. When you're inside, it's all,\nI mean, we had top secret, we had TSSCI clearances at the time. I had a CAT 6, CAT 12, which\nmakes me nuclear cleared. My wife had other privy\nclearances that allowed her to look into, you know,\nareas that were specialized. But there wasn't a headline that went out that we couldn't fact check\nwith a click of a few buttons. And she misses that 'cause\nshe loved that kind of... - And now you're just one of\nus living in the, you know, the cloud of mystery.\n- [Andrew] Exactly. Not really knowing anything\nabout what's going on. - Exactly, but for me,\nI've always been the person that likes operating. And you know what you still\nget to do when you leave CIA, you still get to operate. Operating is just working with people. It's understanding how people think, predicting their actions,\ndriving their direction of their thoughts, persuading\nthem, winning negotiations. You still get to do that.\nYou do that every day. - And you go apply that\nin all kinds of domains. Well, let me ask you on that, you were a covert CIA intelligence officer for several years. Maybe can you tell me the\nstory of how it all began? Were you recruited and\nwhat did the job entail? To the degree you can speak about. - Feel free to direct me\nif I'm getting too boring. - No, every aspect of\nthis is super exciting. (both laughing) - So I was leaving the United\nStates Air Force in 2007. I was a lieutenant getting\nready to pin on captain. My five years was up and I was a very bad fit\nfor the US Air Force. I was an Air Force Academy\ngraduate, not by choice, but by lack of opportunity, lack of lack of options otherwise. So I forced myself through\nthe academy, barely graduated with a 2.4 GPA and then went on the Air\nForce, taught me how to fly. And then the Air Force taught\nme about nuclear weapons. And I ended up as a nuclear\nmissile commander in Montana. And I chose to leave the Air Force because I didn't like shaving my face. I didn't like having short hair and I most definitely didn't\nlike shining my shoes. And I did not want to be one of the people in charge of nuclear weapons. So when I found myself\nas a person in charge of 200 nuclear weapons, I knew that I was going\ndown the wrong road. - I have questions about this and more importantly, I have questions about your hair, so you\nhad short hair at the time? - Yeah, you have to, Military regulations, you can't have hair longer than one inch. - Okay, and the beautiful\nhair you have now that came to be in the CIA or after? - So I discovered I had messy hair in CIA 'cause I used to go muj, we called it muj. I used to go mujahideen style. Big burly beard and crazy wacky hair. Because an ambiguously\nbrown guy with a big beard and long hair can go anywhere in the world without anyone even noticing him. They either think that he is a janitor or they think that he is like some forgotten part of history. But nobody ever thinks\nthat that guy is a spy. So it was the perfect, for me, it was one of my favorite disguises. It's what's known as a level two disguise. One of my favorite disguises to don was just dilapidated brown guy. (both laughing) - Can you actually, we'll\njust take a million tangents. What's a level two disguise? What are the different levels of disguise? What are the disguises? - Yeah, there's three levels\nof disguise by and large. Level one is what we\nalso call light disguise. So that's essentially, you put\non sunglasses and a ball cap and that's a disguise. You look different than you normally look. So it's just different enough that someone who's never seen you before, someone who literally has to see you just from a picture on the internet, they may not recognize you. It's why you see celebrities\nwalk around with ball caps and oversized jackets and baseball hats 'cause they just need to\nnot look like they look in the tabloid or not\nlook like they look in TV. That's level one. Lemme jump from level one to level three. Level three is all of your prosthetics, all the stuff you see\nin \"Mission Impossible.\" Your fake ears, your fake\nfaces, your fat suits, your stilts inside your feet. All that's level three. Whenever they make any kind\nof prosthetic disguise, that's a level three disguise. Because prosthetics are very damning if you are caught with a prosthetic. If you're caught wearing a\nbaseball hat and sunglasses, nobody's gonna say, \"You're a spy.\" But when you're caught with\na custom made, you know, nose prosthetic, that changes\nthe way your face looks. Or when someone pops out a fake jaw and they see that your top\nteeth don't look like they did in this prosthetic, then all of a sudden you've got some very difficult questions to ask or to answer. So level three is extremely dangerous. Level one is not dangerous.\nLevel two is long-term disguise. Level two is all the\nthings that you can do to permanently change the way you look for a long period of time. So that whether you're\naggressed in the street or whether someone breaks\ninto your hotel room or whatever, it's real. So maybe you get a tattoo, maybe you cut your hair short, maybe you grow your hair\nlong, maybe you go bald, maybe you start wearing glasses. Well, glasses are\ntechnically a prosthetic, but if you have teeth pulled, if you gain 20 pounds,\nreally gain 20 pounds or lose 15 pounds, whatever you might do. All of that's considered level two. It's designed for a\nlong-term mission so that people believe you are who you\nsay you are in that disguise. - A lot of that is\nphysical characteristics? What about like, you know, what actors do, which is the..\n- [Andrew] method acting. - Yeah, the method acting sort of developing a backstory in your own mind and then you start, you know, pretending that you host a podcast\nand teach at a university and then do research and so on, just so that people can believe that you're not actually a agent. Is that part of the disguise levels or no? - So yes, disguise has to do\nwith physical character traits. That's what a disguise is. What you're talking about\nis known as a cover legend. When you go undercover,\nwhat you claim to be, who you claim to be, that's\ncalled your cover legend. Every disguise would theoretically have its own cover legend. Even if it's just to\ndescribe why you're wearing what you're wearing. It's all a cover. So the method acting,\nthis is a fantastic point that I don't get to make very\noften, so I'm glad you asked. The difference between\nCIA officers in the field and method actors is\nthat method actors try to become the character. They try to shed all vestiges\nof who they really are and become the character. And that's part of what\nmakes them so amazing. But it's also part of what, like, makes them mentally unstable\nover long periods of time. It's part of what feeds their\ndepression, their anxiety, their personal issues, because they lose sight\nof who they really are. Field officers don't get that luxury. We have to always, always remember we are a covert CIA intelligence officer collecting secrets in the field. We have to remember that. So we're taught a very specific skill to compartmentalize our\ntrue self separately, but make that true self the true identity. So then we can still live and act and effectively carry out\nour cover legend without ever losing sight, without ever\nlosing that compass true north of who we actually are. And then we can compartmentalize and secure all the information\nthat we need, retain it, remember it, but then\nreturn to our true self when we get back to a position of safety. - Is it possible to do that? So I just have kind of\nanecdotal evidence for myself. I really try to be the exact\nsame person in all conditions, which makes it very easy. Like if you're not lying,\nit makes it very easy to, first of all, to exist, but also to communicate\na kind of authenticity and genuineness, which I\nthink is really important. Like trust and integrity around trust is extremely important to me. It's the thing that opens doors\nand maintains relationships. And I tend to think, like\nwhen I was in Ukraine, so many doors just opened to the like very high security areas\nand everywhere else too. Like I've just interacted with some incredible people\nwithout any kind of concerns. You know, who's this guy,\nis he gonna spread it? You know, all that kind of stuff. And I tend to believe that you are able to communicate a trustworthiness somehow if you just are who you are. And I think, I suppose\nmethod actors are trying to achieve that by becoming something and I just feel like\nthere is very subtle cues that are extremely difficult to fake. Like you really have to become\nthat person, be that person. But you're saying as a CIA\nagent, you have to remember that you are there to collect information. Do you think that gives you away? - So one of the flaws in your argument is that you keep referring to how you feel. I feel this, I feel that, I feel like this I feel like that. That feeling is a\npredictable character trait of all human beings. It's a pink matter, we\ncall it pink matter. It's a cognitive trait. You are not alone in\ntrusting your feelings. All people trust their feelings. But because what CIA teaches us is how to systematically create\nartificial relationships where we're the one in\ncontrol of the source that is giving us intelligence. And the core element to being able to control a relationship is understanding the pink matter truth of feelings. What all people feel\nbecomes their point of view on what reality is. So when you understand and\nyou learn how to manipulate what people feel, then you\ncan essentially direct them to feel any way you want them to feel. So if you want them to feel\nlike they can trust you, you can make them feel that way. If you want them to feel\nlike you're a good guy or a bad guy, if you want them to feel like they should give you secrets, even though their government\ntells them not to, you can do that. There are men who make women\nfeel like they love them, and just so the women\nwill sleep with them. There are women who make\nmen feel like they love them just so the men will\ngive them their money. Manipulation is a core behavioral trait of all the human species because we all understand to some level how powerful feelings are, but feelings are not the same thing as logical, rational thought. They're two different sides of the brain. What CIA teaches us how to\ndo is systematically tap into the right side, emotional side\nof the brain so that we can quickly get past all of the\nstuff you were just saying. All of the well, don't\nyou have to be convincing and don't you have to\nreally know your story and don't you have to\nbe able to defend it, don't you have to have authenticity and don't you have to\nhave genuine feelings? Yes, all of those things\nare true if you're having a genuine relationship, but\nin an artificial relationship, there's ways to bypass all of that and get right to the\nheart of making someone feel comfortable and safe. - I guess the question I'm asking, and the thing I was implying is that creating an artificial relationship is an extremely difficult\nskill to accomplish the level. Like how good I am at being me and creating a feeling in\nanother person that I create, for you to do that artificially, my sense is you gotta be really damn good at that kind of thing. I would venture to say it's,\nI mean, I don't know how to measure how difficult the thing is, but especially when you're communicating with people whose job depends on forming trusting relationships, they're gonna smell bullshit. And to get past that\nbullshit detector is tough. It's a tough skill. - [Andrew] Well, it's interesting,\nso I would say that... - Or maybe I'm wrong actually on that. - I would say that once\nyou understand the system, it's not that hard. It makes a lot of sense. But I would also say\nthat to your exact point, you are right that people smell bullshit. People smell bullshit. But here's the thing, if you come in smelling like goat shit, you still smell like shit, but you don't smell like bullshit. So they don't count you out right away. And if you come in smelling\nlike rotten tomatoes or if you come in smelling like lavender, or if you come in smelling like manila or if you come in\nwithout any smell at all, all that matters is that you\ndon't smell like bullshit. Here's the thing that's one\nof the secret sauces of CIA. When you look and act like a spy, people think you're a spy . If you look and act in any\nother way, you know what, they never ever think you are? A spy. They might think you're an idiot. They might think you're trailer trash, they might think that\nyou're a migrant worker, but they never think you're a spy. And that lesson in everyday\nlife is immensely powerful. If you're trying to take your boss's job, as long as you don't ever\nlook like the employee who's trying to take the boss's job, the boss is focused on all the employees who are trying to take his job. Everybody's prioritizing\nwhether they know it or not. The goal is to just not be the\none that they're targeting. Target them without them\nknowing you're targeting them. - So people just, when they\nmeet you, they put you in a bin. And if you want to avoid\nbeing put in a particular bin, just don't act like the\nperson that will be, just show some kind of characteristics that bin you in some other way. - Exactly right. You have to be in a bin. Just choose the bin. (Andrew laughing) - Alright, so how you knowing these methods,\nwhen you talk to people, especially in civilian\nlife, how do you know who's lying to you and not? - That gets to be more\ninto the trained skill side of things. There's body cues,\nthere's micro expressions. I don't believe that micro\nexpressions alone do anything. I also don't believe\nthat micro expressions without an effective baseline do anything. So don't for a second think that I'm... All the people out there pitching that you can tell if someone's lying to you just by looking at\ntheir face, it's all baloney. In my world, that's baloney. - Like the way you move your\neyes or something like that? - [Andrew] Without knowing a\nbaseline, without knowing... - For that individual.\n- For that individual, then you actually don't know. And an individual's baseline\nis based on education, culture, life experience, you name it, right? So it's huge. But when you combine facial\nexpressions with body movements, body language, nonverbal cues, and you add on top of that\neffective elicitation techniques that you are in control of, now you have a more robust platform to tell if someone's lying to you. - So there's like a set of\nlike interrogation trajectories you can go down that can\nhelp you figure out a person. - Technically they're interview concepts. - [Lex] Like this podcast concepts. - Correct, because an interrogation and interrogation is something very different than an interview. And in the world of professionals and interrogation is very different. - What's the difference? The nature or how relaxed\nthe thing is or what? - So in an interrogation there's a clear pattern of dominance. There's no equality.\nAlso, there's no escape. You are there until the\ninterrogator is done with you. Anybody who's ever been\nreprimanded by mom and dad knows what an interrogation feels like. Anybody who's ever been called\ninto the principal's office or the boss's office, that's\nwhat interrogation feels like. You don't leave until the\nboss says you can leave and you're there to answer questions, the boss asks questions. An interview is an\nequal exchange of ideas. You are in control of\nthis interview for sure. But if we were having coffee, I could take control if\nI wanted to take control, if I wanted to ask you\npersonal questions, I would, if I wanted to talk to you\nabout your background, I could. - Why am I in control of\nthis interview? Exactly. - Because the person in control is the person asking questions, always. - I'm sitting here, as\nyou've spoken about, my power here is I'm\nthe quiet one listening. (both laughing) - You're exactly right. Guess\nwhere this conversation goes? Anywhere you choose to take it, because you're the one asking questions. Every time I answer a question,\nI'm creating a pattern of obedience to you, which subliminally,\nsubconsciously makes me that much more apt to\nanswer your questions. - Of course you can always turn that and start asking me questions\nthat should, you know... But you're saying that there's, through conversation, you\ncan call it interviewing, you can start to see cracks in the story of the person and the degree to which\nthey exaggerate or lie or to see how much they could be trusted, that kind of stuff? - What I'm saying is that through a conversation you\ndevelop a baseline, right? Like even just in the first\npart of our conversation, I've been able to create some\nbaseline elements about you. You've been able to create\nbaseline elements about me. Maybe they're just not front of mind. From those baselines, now we can push through more intentional\nquestions to test... - [Lex] Got it. - To test whether or not\nthe person is being truthful because they're operating\nwithin their baseline. Or if you are triggering\nsensitivities outside of their baseline, and then you can start to see their tells. - That's fascinating, yeah baseline, like even like the tells, right? The eye contact. Like you've probably\nalready formed a baseline. I have trouble making eye contact. And so like, so if you\nask me difficult questions and I'm not making eye contact, maybe that's not a good signal\nof me lying or whatever. Because I always have\ntrouble making eye contact, stuff like that. That's really fascinating. - The majority of your eye\nmovement is to the right. Your right. My left, right? Which is usually someone who's, if you ask micro expressionists, that's someone who's referencing fact. That's not necessarily\nwhat's happening for you because you're pulling\nconcepts out of the air. So it's also a place that you reference something other than fact. It's a place for you to find creativity. So if I just thought that you were lying because you look up and to the right, I would be wrong. - That's so fascinating. And a lot of that has\nto do with like, habits that are formed and all\nthose kinds of things. Or maybe some right hand,\nleft hand type of situation. - [Andrew] Right eye dominance. - Right eye dominance is gonna\nmake you look to the right. - Is this a science or an art? - It's a bit of both. I would say that like all good art, art is taught from a foundation of skills. And those skills are played or taught in a very structured manner. And then the way that you use the skills after that's more of the artistic grace. So I've always called espionage\nan art. Spying is an art. Being able to hack human beings is an art, but it's all based in a\nfoundation of science. You still have to learn how\nto mix the color palette and use certain brushes. - Do you think of that as a kind of the study\nof human psychology? Isn't that what a psychologist\ndoes? Or a psychiatrist? What, from this process, have you learned about human nature? - [Andrew] Human nature? - I mean, I suppose the answer to that could be a book, and\nprobably will be a book. - [Andrew] I'll save you that, yeah. - But sort of is there\nthings that are surprising about human nature,\nsurprising to us civilians that you could speak to? - Yes, one thing is extremely\nsurprising about human nature, which is funny 'cause that's\nnot the answer I would've said. So I'm glad that you clarified\nthis specific question. The thing that's surprising\nabout human nature is that human beings\nlong, like in their soul, there's like a painful longing\nto be with other people. And that's really surprising because we all wanna\npretend like we're strong. We all wanna pretend like\nwe're, you know, independent. We all wanna pretend like we\nare the masters of our destiny. But what's truly consistent\nin all people is this like, longing to commune with others like us. My more practical answer\nabout what I've learned to be the truth is that\nhuman nature is predictable. And that predictability is what gives people an incredible\nadvantage over other people. But that's not the surprising piece. I mean, even when CIA taught me that human nature is\npredictable, it just made sense. I was like, oh yeah, that makes sense. But what I never ever\nanticipated was, no matter where I've been in the world,\nno matter who I've talked to, no matter what socioeconomic bracket, is that longing, man, it hurts. Loneliness sucks. And\ntogetherness feels good. Even if you're together\nwith someone you know isn't the right person, it still\nfeels better than being alone. - I mean, that's such a\ndeep truth you speak to. And I could talk about that for a long time. There is, I mean, through\nthese conversations in general, whether it's being recorded or not, I hunger to discover in the\nother person that longing, you strip away the other things and then you share in the\nlonging for that connection. And I particularly also\nhave detected that in people from all walks of life. Including people that others\nmight identify as evil or hard as completely cold, it's there. - It's there, they've hardened\nthemselves in their search and who knows what dark\nplace their brain is in, their heart is in. But that longing is still there. Even if it's an ember, it's there. It's the reason why in World War I and World War II, you know, enemy combatants still shared\ncigarettes on the front lines, you know, during periods of holidays or bad weather or whatever else. Because that human connection,\nman, it triumphs overall. - See, that's in part of what\nI refer to when I say love. Because I feel like if\nlike political leaders and people in conflict at the small scale and the large scale were able to tune into that\nlonging to seek in each other that basic longing for human connection. A lot of problems could be solved, but of course is difficult because it's a game of chicken is if you open yourself\nup to reveal that longing for connection with others,\npeople can hurt you. - Well, I would go a step farther and I would say that taking\nthe connection away, punishing, penalizing people by\nremoving the connection is a powerful tool. And that's what we see. That's\nwhy we send people to jail. That's why we put economic\nsanctions on countries. That's why we ground our children and send them to their rooms. We are penalizing them,\nwhether we know it or not. We're using punitive damage by taking away that basic human connection,\nthat longing for community. - What was your recruitment\nprocess and training process and things you could speak to in the CIA? - As I was leaving the Air\nForce, all that was on my mind. I don't know what you were like at 27, but I was a total dip shit at 27. I'm not much better now at 42, but yeah... - You owe me both.\n(both laughing) Fake it till you make it. - But I was like, I just wanted to be anything other\nthan a military officer. So I was actually in\nthe process of applying to the Peace Corps through\nthis thing called the internet, which was still fairly\nrudimentary in 2007. I had a computer lab that we went to and it had 10 computers in\nit and you had to log in and log out and slow\ninternet and everything else. But anyways, I was filling\nout an online application to go work in the US Peace Corps. I wanted to grow my hair out. I wanted to stop wearing\nshoes that were shiny. I wanted to meet a hippie chick and have hippie babies in the wild, teaching Nigerian children how to read. So that was the path I was going down. And as I filled in all of my\ndetails, there came this page that popped up and it was\nthis blinking red page and it said, \"Stop here. You may qualify for other\ngovernment positions. If you're willing to put\nyour application on hold for 72 hours, that gives us a\nchance to reach out to you.\" So again, 27-year-old, I was like, sure, I'll put myself on hold if I might qualify for other government opportunities. And then about a day\nlater I got a phone call from an almost unlisted number. It just said 703, which was very strange to see on my flip phone at the time. Just one 703 area code. And I picked it up and it was a person from Northern Virginia telling\nme that I was qualified for a position in national security and if I would be interested,\nthey'll pay for my ticket and fly me up to Langley, Virginia. They didn't say CIA, they said Langley. I put one and one together and I was like, maybe this is CIA. Like this could, how cool is this? Or maybe this is all make-believe\nand this is totally fake. So either way it doesn't\nhurt me at all to say \"Yes\", they already have my phone number. So yes, yes, yes. And then I remember\nthinking, there's no way that happened and this isn't real. And then a day later I got\nFedEx or an overnight delivery of an airplane ticket and a hotel reservation and\na rental car reservation. And then I just kept doing the next thing, which I found out later\non as a form of control. You just do the next thing\nthat they tell you to do. And then before I knew\nit, I was interviewing in a nondescript building with a person who only told me their\nfirst name for a position with the National Clandestine Service. - So you never really got\na chance to think about it because there's a small\nsteps along the way and it kind of just leads you and maybe your personality such that... - [Andrew] That's an adventure. - It's an adventure and because\nit's one step at a time, you don't necessarily see\nthe negative consequences of the adventure. You don't think about any of that. You're just stepping into the adventure one step at a time. - And it's easy. There's no work involved. Somebody else is doing all the work telling me where to be and when. It's a lot like basic\ntraining in the military. Anybody who's ever been through\nbasic training will tell you they hated the first few days. And then by the end it\nwas really comforting because you just did what you were told. They told you when to eat, they made the decision of what to eat. Then you marched when\nthey told you to march, shined your shoes when they\ntold you to shine your shoes. Human beings love being told what to do. - What about the training process for becoming a covert CIA agent? - So the interview process is... - Yeah, the interview process too. How rigorous was that? - It was very rigorous. That was where it became difficult. Everything up to the\nfirst interview was easy, but there's three interviews\nand some people are lucky enough to have four or five interviews if something goes wrong or something goes awry with\nthe first few interviews. And again, this might be dated\nfrom what I went through, but during the interview process is when they do your psychological evaluations. They do personality assessments,\nthey do skills assessments. They'll start sending you back to your, wherever you're living with assignments. Not intel assignments, but actual like homework assignments. Write an essay about\nthree parts of the world that you think will be most impacted in the next three to five years. Or, you know, prioritize the\ntop three strategic priorities for the United States and you know, put it into\n250 words or 2,500 words and whatever else, double spaced in this\nfont, yada, yada, yada. Like super specific stuff. It's kind of stressful, but it's just like going back to college again. So you go through all of those acts and then you submit this\nstuff to some PO box that doesn't have anybody that's\never gonna respond to you. And then you hope you just\nsend it into the ether and you hope that you sent it right. You hope that you wrote well enough. You hope that your assessment was right, whatever else it might be. And then eventually get\nanother phone call that says, \"Hey, we received your package. You've been moved to the\nnext level of interview and now we need you to go to\nthis other nondescript building in this other nondescript city.\" And then you start meeting, you start sitting in waiting rooms with other groups of people who are at the same phase\nof interview with you, which were some of the coolest experiences that I remember still. One of my best friends to\nthis day who I don't get to talk to, 'cause he's still undercover, is a guy I met during\nthose interview processes. And I was like, oh, we met\nand I saw what he was wearing. He saw what I was wearing. I was brown. - So you immediately connected and you liked the people there? - Close. More like we\nimmediately judge each other. 'Cause we're all untrained. So he looked at me and he was like, brown\ndude with crazy hair. And I was wearing, dude, I\nwas dressed like a total ass. I was dressed in like a clubbing shirt. I don't know why I thought\nit would be a good idea to go to a CIA interview in\nlike a clubbing shirt with my buttons unbuttoned down to here. And he was like, after\nwe got in, he was like, \"Yeah dude, you were always\nreally cool to talk to.\" But I was like, there's no\nway that idiot's getting in. And I remember looking\nat him and being like, \"Dude, you were just another\nwhite guy in a black suit. They're not looking for\nyou. But here you are.\" So it was just, those kinds\nof things were so interesting 'cause we were totally wrong\nabout what CIA was looking for. Until you're in, you have no\nidea what they're looking for and you're just shooting in the dark. - Did they have you do\nlike a lie detector test? - Yes. It's called a polygraph. - Polygraph, how\neffective, just interesting Per our previous discussion. How effective are those? - Polygraphs are really interesting. So one of the things that people don't\nunderstand about polygraphs is that polygraphs aren't\nmeant to detect a lie. Like they're called a lie detector, but they're not actually\nmeant to detect a lie. They're built to detect variants from your physiological baseline. So they're essentially meant\nto identify sensitivities to certain types of questions. And then as they identify a\nsensitivity to a question, it gives the interviewer an\nadditional piece of information to direct the next round of questions. So then from there they can kind of see how sensitive you are to a\ncertain level of questions. And your sensitivity could\nbe a sign of dishonesty, but it could also be a\nsign of vulnerability. So the interrogator themselves,\nthe interviewer themselves, they're the one that have to make the judgment call as to which one it is. Which is why you might\nsee multiple interviewers over the course of multiple polygraphs. But that's really what they're all about. So I mean, they're\nextremely uncomfortable, like they're mentally uncomfortable. But then there's also, you sit on a pad because the pad is supposed to be able to tell like your body movements, but also like your sphincter\ncontractions or whatever. So you're sitting on this\npad, you're plugged in, you're strapped in, you're tied up, and it takes so much time to get in there. And then they start asking you questions, baseline questions at first, and then other questions from there. And you're just answering\nthe best you can. And you never know what they're seeing and you don't know what they're doing. And it's really hard not to\nget anxious of that anyways. - Are they the whole time\nmonitoring the readings? - Yeah, from like a big,\nthey've got multiple screens and it's all information superiority. They have information superiority. You're the idiot looking away from them or looking sideways of\nthem and trying not to move because you're afraid\nthat if you like have gas or if you move a little bit's gonna vary you from your baseline. And the whole time you're\nworried your heart's racing and your blood pressure's increasing, which is a variance from baseline. So yeah, I means an interesting art. - Or your baseline.\n- [Andrew] Correct. - Maybe there's some people that are just chilling the whole time and that's their baseline. - But that's what they're doing. They're establishing a baseline. I mean, I guess that means\nthe polygraph is a skill that you develop to do it well. - So when people talk about\nbeating a lie detector, it's not that they're\ntelling an effective lie. That's not hard. It's not hard to tell a\nlie to an interviewer. And the interviewer doesn't\ncare if you're being honest or not honest about a topic. What they're looking for is sensitivity. If they see no sensitivity,\nthat's a big sign for them. That's a big sign that you're\nprobably a pathological liar. If you show sensitivity to\nmany things, then that's a sign that you're probably an anxious person and they can still reset their baseline because they can tell how\nyour anxiety is increasing, you know, in 15 minute increments. It's a unique skill. I mean, a really good polygrapher\nis immensely valuable. But it's the misnomers, the misconceptions about\npolygraphs are vast. - You also mentioned personality tests. That's really interesting. So how effective are personality tests? One for the hiring process, but also for understanding a human being. - So personality is extremely important for understanding human being. And I would say that there's\na thousand different ways of looking at personality. The only one that I count with any significance is the MBTI. And the MBTI is what all\nthe leading spy agencies around the world use as well. - Well, that's kind of\ninteresting to hear. So there's been criticisms\nof that kind of test. - There have been\ncriticisms for a long time. - And you think there's value?\n- Absolutely. Absolutely. And there's a few reasons why, right? So first, MBTI makes the claim that your core personality\ndoesn't change over time. And that's how it's calibrated. And one of the big\narguments is that people say that your personality\ncan change over time. In my experience, the\nMBTI is exactly correct. Your core personality does not change because your core personality is defined as your personality when\nall resources are removed. So essentially your emergency\nmode, your dire conditions, that is your core personality. We can all act a little more extroverted. We can all, you know, be a little more empathetic\nwhen we have tons of time and money and patience. When you strip away all that\ntime, money, and patience, how empathetic are you? How much do you like\nbeing around other people? How much do you like being alone? Do you make judgements or do you analyze information? That's what's so powerful about MBTI, it's talking about what people are like when you strip away resources. And then because it's so consistent, it's also only four codes. It's super easy to be able\nto assess a human being through a dialogue, through\na series of conversations to be able to hone in with high accuracy, what is there four letter code. There's only 16 options and\nit becomes extremely valuable. Is it perfectly precise? And\ndoes everybody do it the same? I mean, the answers to those are no. But is it operationally useful\nin a short period of time? That is a resoundingly powerful yes. - Yeah I only know I\nthink the first letter, it's introvert and extroverted, right? - [Andrew] Yep.\nI've taken the test before, just like a crude version of the test. And that's the same problem\nyou have with IQ tests. There's the right thorough way of doing it and then there's like fun\ninternet way of doing. And do you mind sharing what your personality... - [Andrew] Yeah my type index?\n- Yes. - I'm an ENTP, that's an extrovert, intuitor, perceiver, thinker. ENT thinker, P perceiver. My wife is an ISFJ, which\nis the polar opposite of me. E, I'm extroverted. She's introverted. I'm an intuitive, she's a sensor. I'm a thinker. She's a feeler. I'm a perceiver. She's a judger. - Is there a good science on like long-term successful relationships in terms of the dynamics of that? The 16, I wonder if\nthere's good data on this. - I don't think there's a lot of good data in personalities writ large. Because there's not a lot of money to be made in personality testing. But I would say that with experience with a good MBTI test with a good paid test, a\n400, 500 question test. Once you understand your own code and then you're taught how\nto assess the code of others. With those two things kind of combined 'cause then you have\nexperience in learning. It becomes very useful. And you can have high\nconfidence in the conclusions that you reach about people's professions, about people's relationships with family, about people's relationships\nprofessionally, people's capabilities to deal with stress, how people will perform when pushed outside of\ntheir comfort zones. Really, really powerful useful\nstuff in corporate world and in the espionage world. - So in terms of compressed representation of another human being, you can't do much better\nthan those four letters. - I don't believe you can do much better. In my experience, I have\nnot seen anything better. - Yeah, it's difficult to realize that there is a core personality\nor the degree that's true. It seems to be true. It's even more difficult to\nrealize that there is a stable, or at least the science says so, a stable, consistent intelligence. Unfortunately, you know,\nthe G factor that they call that if you do a barrage\nof IQ test that's going to consistently represent that G factor. And we're all born with\nthat and we can't fix it. And that defines so much\nof who we are. It's sad. - I don't see it as sad because it's, for me,\nthe faster you learn it, the faster you learn what your\nown sort of natural strengths and weaknesses are, the faster\nyou get to stop wasting time on things that you're\nnever gonna be good at. And you get to double down on the things that you're already naturally\nskilled or interested in. So there's always a\nsilver lining to a cloud. But I know now that I\nwill never be a ballerina or a ballerino. I know that I'll never be an artist, I'll never be a musician. I'll never be any of those things. And when I was 18, that\nmight've made me sad. But now at 42, I'm like,\nwell shit, awesome. I can go be something else good instead of always being bad. - You're not gonna be a\nballerina (indistinct)? - Because I'm not graceful. - And you've learned this\nthrough years of experience. - [Andrew] Yeah, exactly. - Well, I don't know if\nthere's an MBTI equivalent for grace of movement. - I think it's called S sensor. Because a sensor is someone\nwho's able to interact with the world around them through their five\nsenses very effectively. Like if you talk to dancers, dancers can actually feel the\ngrace in all of their muscles. They know what position\ntheir finger is in. I don't have any idea, I don't know what position my feet are in right now. I'd have to look to make sure I actually feel the floor right. - Yeah, I definitely have...\nOh, that's good to know. So I don't, you know, I'm not\na dancer, but I do have that. - [Andrew] You're a musician man. - Well the music, I don't\nknow if that correlated - [Andrew] To be able to plug guitar. - Sure, yeah, that's true. There is that physical component, but I think deeper 'cause there's a technical aspect to that that's just like, it's less about feel. But I do know jiujitsu, you know, and grappling I've done all my life. I don't, you know, there's\nsome people who are clumsy and they drop stuff all the time. They run into stuff. I don't. First of all, I don't know\nhow that happens, but to me, I just have an awareness of stuff. Like if there's a little... - [Andrew] Spiritual orientation. - Yeah, like I know that\nthere's a small object I have to step over and I have\na good sense of that. It's so interesting. Yeah, you're just like born\nwith that or something. - My wife is brilliant and\nshe still walks into doors. I mean, she'll walk in a doorway, she'll bang her knee on the same wall that's been there for the last 50 years. - It's for some reason really hilarious. That's good for that.\n(Andrew laughing) You've been asked, I think on Reddit, \"Are there big secrets that you know that could lend you and our\ncountry in terrible trouble if you came out to the public?\" And you answered, \"Yes, I\nwish I could forget them.\" So lemme ask you just\nabout secrecy in general. Are these secrets or just other secrets, ones that the public will never know or will it come out in 10, 20, 50 years? I guess the deeper question is what is the value of\nsecrecy and transparency? - The standard classification for all human intelligence operations is something called 25X2, 25 by 2. So 50 years, 25 years times\ntwo years, or times two rounds. So in essence, anything that\nI've seen has the first chance of becoming public domain\ndeclassified after 50 years, unless there's some\ncongressional requirement for it to be reviewed and assessed earlier. So by then, you know, I'll\nbe 80 something years old or potentially dead, which\nis either way, that's when it can come out according to\nits typical classification. The value of secrets I have seen is that secrets create space. Secrets give opportunity for security. They give opportunity for\nthinking they give space. And space is an incredibly\nadvantageous thing to have. If you know something\nsomebody else doesn't know, even if it's just 15 or\n20 minutes different, you can change the course of fate. So I find secrets to be extremely valuable, extremely useful. Even at the place where\nsecrets are being kept from a large mass, part of what all Americans\nneed to understand is that one of the trade-offs to\nbuilding a system of government that allows us to be first world and wealthy and secure and successful. One of the trade-offs is that we have given up a great\ndeal of personal freedom. And one of the personal freedoms that we give up is the freedom of knowing what we want to know. You get to know what the\ngovernment tells you. You get to know what you need to know or what you've learned yourself, but you don't get to know secrets. People who do get to know\nsecrets know them for a reason. That's why it's called a need to know. - How difficult is it to maintain secrecy? - It's surprisingly difficult\nas technology changes. It's also surprisingly difficult as our culture becomes one\nwhere people want notoriety, people wanna be the person\nwho breaks the secret. 25 years ago, 40 years\nago, that wasn't the case. There was a time in the United States where if someone gave you a secret, it was a point of personal\nhonor not to share the secret. Now we're in a place where\nsomeone tells you a secret like that could turn into a Twitter post that gets you a bunch of thumbs up and a bunch of likes or whatever else. - [Lex] It's an opportunity.\n- Right. So the value of secrets has changed and now there's almost a greater\nvalue on exposing secrets than there is on keeping secrets. That makes it difficult to keep secrets, especially when technology is\ngoing in the same direction. - Where is the line? And by the way, I'm one\nof those old school people with the secrets. I think it's a karma thing. Again, back to the trust. I think in the short term, you can benefit by sharing a secret. But in the long term, if people know they can trust you, like the juicy of the secret, it's a test of sorts, if\nthey know you can keep that secret, that means\nlike you're somebody that could be trusted. And I believe that like, not just effectiveness in this life, but happiness in this\nlife is informing a circle of people you can trust. - Right, we're taught that secrets and lies are similar in that\nthey have a limited shelf life. If you treat them like food. Secrets and lies have a\nvery limited shelf life. So if you cash in on them\nwhile they're still fresh, you beat them before they spoil. You get to take advantage\nof 'em before they spoil. However, trust has no\nlimit to its shelf life. So it's almost like you're\ntrading a short-term victory and losing a long-term victory. It's always better to keep the secret. It's always better to let the lie live because it will eventually come\nto light from somebody else, not from you, because it already\nhas a limited shelf life. But what you win in exchange\nfor not being the one that cashed in on the\nsecret is immense trust. - Let me ask you about\nlying and trust and so on. So I don't believe I've been contacted by or interacted with the CIA,\nthe MI6, the FSB, Massod or any other intelligence agency. I'm kind of offended.\n(Andrew laughing) But would I know if I was? So from your perspective.\n- No. You would not know if you were. For sure you've been on\ntheir radar. Absolutely. You've got a file, you've\ngot a dossier somewhere. - Why would I be on the radar? - [Andrew] Because you're...\n- Who's interesting - It's not necessarily that you are interesting to\nsomeone as a foreign asset or an intelligence collection source, but your network is extremely interesting. - The networks are important too? - Correct, if someone was\nable to clone your phone, every time you cross a border, you go through some sort of security. If you've ever been pulled into secondary and separated from your\nbag, that's exactly when and how people clone computers. They clone phones, they\nmake whatever photocopies of your old school planner,\nwhatever it might be. But for sure, you are\nan intelligence target. It just may be that you're\nnot suitable to be a person who reports foreign intelligence. We've gotta understand that all\npeople are potential sources of valuable information to the national security\ninfrastructure of our host country and any country that we visit. Someone like you with\nyour public footprint, with your notoriety, with your educational background, with your national\nidentifications, becomes a viable and valuable target of information. - Yeah, so to speak to that, you know, I take security\npretty seriously, but not to the degree that, you know, it runs my life, which\nI'm very careful about. - [Andrew] That's good.\nI'm glad to hear that. - So the moment you start\nto think about germs, right, like you start to freak out and you become sort of\nparalyzed by the stress of it. So you have to balance those two things. If you think about all the things that can hurt you in this world and all the risk you can take it can overwhelm your life. That said, the cyber\nworld is a weird world. Because it doesn't have the same... I know not to cross the street\nwithout looking each way because there's a physical\nintuition about it. I'm not sure, you know,\nI'm a computer science guy, so I have some intuition,\nbut it's the cyber world, it's really hard to build up an intuition what is safe and not. I've seen a lot of people, you know, just a logging out of\nyour devices all the time, like regularly, just like\nthat physical access step is, a lot of people don't take, I can just like walk in into\nthe offices of a lot of CEOs and everything's wide open for physical access of those systems, which is kind of incredible for somebody, that sounds really shady, but it's not. I've written key loggers, like things that record\neverything you type and the mouse you moved and like, I did during my PhD, I was recording everything\nyou do on your device and everything you do on\nyour computer to under, like, people sign up to the study,\nthey willingly do this to understand behavior. I was trying to use machine\nlearning to identify who you are based on different biometric and behavioral things, which allows me to study human behavior and to see which is uniquely identifiable. And the goal there was to\nremove the need for a password, but how easy it is to write a thing that logs everything you type. I was like, wait a minute. Like I can probably get a\nlot of people in the world to run this for me. I can then get all of their passwords. I mean, you could do so much. Like I can run the entirety of\nthe CIA just myself if I was, and I imagine there's a lot of\nreally good hackers like that out there, much better than me. So I try to prevent myself from being all the different low\nhanging fruit attack vectors in my life. I try to make it difficult to be that. But then I'm also aware\nthat there's probably people that are like five steps ahead. - You're doing the right thing. What I always advocate is\nthe low hanging fruit is what keeps you from being\na target of opportunity because you're half-assed\nhackers, you're lazy hackers, your unskilled hackers they're looking for low hanging fruit. They're looking for the person\nwho gets the Nigeria email about how you could be getting $5 million if you just gimme your bank account. That's what they're looking for. And the thing that's scary is\nthat if you're not a target of opportunity, if you\nbecome a intentional target, then there's almost nothing you can do. Because once you become\nan intentional target, then your security apparatus, they will create a dedicated,\ncustomized vector of attacking your specific security apparatus. And because security\nis always after, right? There's the leading advantage and the trailing advantage. When it comes to attacks, the leader always has the advantage because they have to create the attack before anybody else can create a way to protect against the attack. So the attack always comes first and that means they\nalways have the advantage. You are always stuck just leaning on this is the best security that I know of. Meanwhile, there's always\nsomebody who can create a way of attacking the best security out there. And once they win, they have a monopoly. They have all that time until a new defensive\ncountermeasure is deployed. - Yeah, I tend to think\nexactly as you said, that the low hanging fruit\nprotects against like yeah, crimes of opportunity. And then I assume that\npeople can just hack in if they really want. - Think about how much\nanxiety we would be able to solve if everybody just accepted that. - Well, there's several things you do. First of all, to be honest, it keeps me honest not to be a douche bag or like not to assume everything could be public and so don't trade in information that could hurt people\nif it was made public. So I try to do that. And the thing I try to make sure is I like home alone style, try... (Andrew laughing)\n- [Andrew] A booby trap. - I really would like\nto know if I was hacked. And so I try to assume\nthat I will be hacked and detect it. - [Andrew] Have a trip wire of some sort. - Yeah, a trip wire through everything. And not paranoid trip\nwires, just like open door. But I think that's probably the future of life on this earth like, everybody of interest\nis going to be hacked. That hopefully inspires, now\nthis is outside of company. These are individuals I mean. There's of course if\nyou're actually operating, like who am I? I'm just a scientist\nperson, podcasting person. So if I was actually running a company or was an integral part of some kind of military operation,\nthen you have to probably have to have an entire team\nthat's now doing that battle of like trying to be ahead of like the best hackers in\nthe world that are attacking. But that requires a team that like full time is their focus. Even then you still get in trouble. - Correct, so what I've\nseen as the norm, well what I've seen is the cutting\nedge standard for corporations and the ultra wealthy and even intelligence organizations is that we have trip wires. If you can't prevent from being hacked, the next best thing is to know\nas soon as you get hacked, because then you can essentially terminate all the information. If you know it fast enough, you can just destroy the information. This is what the ultra wealthy do. They have multiple phones. So as soon as one phone gets\nhacked, the trip wire goes off, the operating system is totally deleted along with all data on the phone. And a second phone is turned on with a whole new separate set of metadata. And now for them, there's\nno break in service. It's just, oh, this phone went black. It's got a warning on it\nthat says it was hacked. So trash it 'cause they don't care about the price of the phone. Pick up the next phone and we move on. That's the best thing that\nyou can do essentially outside of trying to out hack the hackers. And then even in your intelligence and military worlds where\ncyber warfare is active, the people who are aggressing are not trying to create\naggression that beats security. They're trying to find\na aggressive techniques, offensive techniques that have no security built around them yet,\nbecause it's too cost and time intensive to protect against what you know is coming. It's so much more efficient\nand cost effective to go after new vectors. So it just becomes like, it becomes almost a silly\ngame of your neighbor gets a guard dog, so you\nget a bigger guard dog and then your neighbor gets a fence. So you're just constantly\noutdoing each other. It's called the security paradigm. People just one up each other because it's never worth it\nto just get to the same level. You're always trying to outdo each other. - Yeah, then maybe like banks\nhave to fight that fight. But not everybody can... Yeah, no, so you're saying I\noperate at the state of the art with the trip wires, this is good to know. - [Andrew] Absolutely, man. - And also just not using\nanybody else's services, doing everything myself. So that's harder to figure out what the heck this person is doing 'cause if I'm using\nsomebody else's service, like I did with QNAP.\n(Andrew laughing) I have a QNAP NAS I used for cold storage of unimportant things\nthat are large videos. And I don't know if you know, but QNAP is a company that\ndoes now storage devices and they got hacked. And everybody that didn't update as of a week ago from the point of the zero day hack,\neverybody got hacked. It's several thousands of machines. And they asked, you can get your data back if you pay, I forget what it was, but it was as about a couple thousand dollars. And the QNAP can get all the data back for their customers if they\npay, I think $2 million. But that came from me relying on the systems of others for security. I assumed this company would\nhave their security handled. But then those very\nvaluable lessons to me. I now have like layers of security and also an understanding\nwhich data is really important, which is somewhat important,\nwhich is not that important and layering that all together. - So just so you know, the US government, the military woke up to\nthat exact same thing about two years ago. It's still very new. I mean, they were sourcing, take night vision goggles, for example. They were sourcing\ncomponents and engineering and blueprints for night vision goggles from three, four, five\ndifferent subcontractors all over the country. But they never asked themselves\nwhat the security status was of those subcontractors. So, you know, fast forward,\nyou know, a few years and all of a sudden they start\ngetting faulty components. They start having night vision\ngoggles that don't work. They start having supply\nchain issues where they have to change their provider. And the army doesn't know\nthat the provider is changing. I mean, this is a strategy. The idea of going through\nthird party systems is identifying the vulnerability\nin the supply chain. That's a savvy offensive practice for more than just, you\nknow, cyber hackers. - Let me ask you about physical hacking. So I'm now like, I'm a introvert, so I'm a paranoid about\nall social interaction. But how much truth is there? It's kind of a funny question. How suspicious should I be\nwhen I'm traveling in Ukraine or different parts of the world when an attractive female walks up to me and shows any kind of a attention? (Andrew laughing)\nIs that like this kind of James Bond spy movie stuff? Or is that kind of stuff used\nby intelligence agencies? - I don't think it's used.\nIt's absolutely used. It's called sex-spionage. That's the term that we jokingly\ncall it, is sex-spionage. But yeah, the art of attraction, appeal, the manifestation of feelings\nthrough sexual manipulation, all of that is super powerful tool. The Chinese use it extremely well. The Russians use it extremely well. In the United States, we actively train our\nofficers not to use it because in the end, it\nleads to complications in how you professionally run a case. So we train our officers not to use it. However, you can't control\nwhat other people think. So if you're an attractive male or an attractive female officer and you're trying to talk to a, you know, an older general who\njust happens to be gay or happens to be straight and is attracted to you,\nof course they're gonna be that much more willing\nto talk to an American who is also attractive. So it's (indistinct). - Well in all definitions, so it could be all elements of charisma. So, you know, attractiveness\nin a dynamic sense of the word. So it's visual attractiveness. But the smile, the humor,\nthe wit, the flirting, all that kind of stuff that could be used to the art of conversation. - There's also elements of sexuality that people underestimate, right? So physical sexuality, physical attraction is\nthe most obvious one. It's the one that everybody\ntalks about and thinks about. But then there's also sapiosexuality, which is being sexually attracted to thoughts, to intelligence. And then you've got all\nthe various varieties of personal preferences. Some people like people\nof a certain color skin or they like big noses,\nthey like small noses, they like big butts,\nthey like small butts, they like tall guys, they like bald guys. Whatever it might be,\nyou can't ever predict what someone's preferences,\nsexual arousal preferences are going to be. So then you end up\nwalking into a situation where then you discover, you know, and just imagine being an unattractive, overweight, married guy. And you're walking into an asset or a target meeting with\nlike a middle aged female who is also not very\nattractive and also married. But then it turns out that\nthat person is a sapiosexual and gets extremely turned on\nby intelligent conversation. That's exactly what you're there to do. Your mission is to have\nintelligent conversation with this person to find out\nif they have access to secrets. And by virtue of you\ncarrying out your mission, they become extremely\naroused and attracted to you. That is a very complicated situation. - It's hard to know who to trust. Like how do you know your wife\nor how does your wife know that you're not a double\nagent from Russia? - There's a large element of experience and time that goes into that. She's also trained and I\nthink my wife and I also.. - [Lex] So you think,\n- Yeah, my wife and I also have the benefit of being recruited young and together where... - So over time you can\nstart to figure out things that are very difficult to... So you form the baseline, you start to understand the person, it becomes very difficult to lie. - The most difficult thing\nin the world is consistency. It's the most difficult\nthing in the world. Some people say that discipline or self-discipline, what they're really talking about is consistency. When you have someone\nwho performs consistently over long periods of time\nunder various levels of stress, you have high, high confidence that that is the person that you can trust. You can trust again, you can trust them to behave within a certain pattern. You can trust an asshole to be an asshole without trusting the asshole\nto take care of your kids. So I don't ever wanna mix up the idea of personal trust versus\ntrusting the outcome. You can always trust a person to operate within their\npattern of behavior. It just takes time for you to get consistent feedback as to what that baseline is for them - So would form a good\nmodel, predictive model of what their behavior's going to be like. - Right and you know, what's\nfascinating is I think the challenge is building\nthat model quickly. So technology is one of those tools that will be able in the future to very quickly create\na model of behavior. Because technology can pull\nin multiple data points in a very short period of time that the human brain simply can't pull in at the same speed. - Well, that's actually\nwhat I did my PhD on. That's what I did at Google, is forming a good representation,\nunique representation, across the entire world based on the behavior of the person. The specific task there is, so that you don't have\nto type in the password. The idea was to replace the password. But it also allows you to\nactually study human behavior and to think, all right,\nwhat is the unique representation of a person? 'Cause we have very specific patterns and a lot of humans are very\nsimilar in those patterns. What are the unique identifiers within those patterns of behavior? And I think that's, from\na psychology perspective, a super fascinating question. And from a machine learning\nperspective, it's something that you can, as the systems\nget better and better and better, and as we get more and more digital data\nabout each individual, you start to be able to do that kind of thing effectively. - And I mean, when I think of the fact that you could create a\ndossier on somebody in a matter of 24 or 48 hours, if you could wire them for two days, right? Internet of things style. You put it in their\nunderwear or whatever, right? Some chip that just reads everything. How heavy are they walking?\nHow much time do they sleep? How many times do they\nopen the refrigerator? When they log into their\ncomputer, how do they do it? Like which hand do they\nuse when they log in? What's their most common swipe? What's their most visited website? You could collect an enormous amount of normative data in\na short period of time where otherwise we're stuck. The way that we do it\nnow, once or twice a week, we go out for a coffee for two hours. And two hours at a time, over the course of six,\neight weeks, 12 weeks, you're coming up with a 50% assessment on how you think this person\nis going to be behave. Just that time savings is immense. - Something you've also spoken\nabout is private intelligence and the power and the reach and the scale and the importance of private intelligence versus government intelligence. Can you elaborate on the role of what is private intelligence and what's the role of private\nintelligence in the scope of all the intelligence that is gathered and used in the United States? - Yeah, absolutely, it's something that so few people know about, and it became a more mainstream topic with the Trump administration because Trump made it no\nsecret that he was going to hire private intelligence organizations to run his intelligence\noperations and fund them. So that really brought\nit to the mainstream. But going all the way back to 9/11, going all the way back to 2001. When the 9/11 attacks happened,\nthere was a commission that was formed to determine the reasons that 9/11 happened. And among the lists that they determined, of course they found out that\nthe intelligence community wasn't coordinating well with each other. There were fiefdoms and\nthere was infighting and there wasn't good intel sharing. But more than that, they\nidentified that we were operating at Cold War levels, even though we were living\nin a time when terrorism was the new biggest threat\nto national security. So the big recommendation\ncoming outta the 9/11 commission was that the intelligence organizations, the intelligence community\nsignificantly increased the presence of intelligence\noperators overseas and in terms of analytical capacity here in the United States. When they made that decision,\nit completely destroyed, it totally was incongruent with\nthe existing hiring process because the existing\nhiring process for CIA or NSA is a six to nine month process. The only way they could plus\nup their sizes fast enough was to bypass their own hiring and instead go direct to\nprivate organizations. So naturally the government\ncontracted with the companies that they already had secure\ncontracts with, Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman,\nKhaki, you know, you name it. And then over time, from 2001 to now, or I guess that started really in 2004, when they started significantly increasing the presence of private\nintelligence officers. From then until now, it's become a budgetary thing. It's become a continuity\nof operations thing. And now the reason Northern Virginia has become one of the wealthiest\nzip codes in America is because of the incredible concentration of private intelligence that is supporting CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI, and all\nthe slew of IC partners. - By the way, does Palantir\nplay a role in this? - Palantir is one of those\norganizations that was trying to pitch their product to\nan intelligence community because it's a fantastic product on paper. But the challenge was\nthe proprietary services, the proprietary systems that we used in CIA prior to Palantir, continued to outperform Palantir. So just like any other business decision, if you've got homegrown systems that outperform external systems and it's not worth it to share\nthe internal information. - Got it, so the close connection between Peter Thiel and Donald Trump, did that have a role to play in Donald Trump's leveraging\nof private intelligence? Or is that completely disjoint? - I think that they're related,\nbut only circumstantially because remember Donald\nTrump wasn't really investing in CIA, so the last thing\nhe wanted to do was spend his network wasta. Wasta is a term that we call influence. It's an Arabic term for influence. Trump didn't want to use his\nwasta putting Thiel into CIA only to lose Thiel's contract\nas soon as Trump left office. So instead, it was more valuable\nto put Peter Thiel's tool to use in private intelligence. And then of course, I think\nhe nominated Peter Thiel to be his Secretary of\nDefense, Secretary of State. At some point in time, he tried to like presidentially appoint\nPeter Thiel into a position of government authority. - What do you think of\nfigures like Peter Thiel? And I'm sure there's\nfigures of similar scale and reach and power in\nprivate intelligence. What do you think about their role and power in this whole, like without public accountability that you would think\ndirectors of CIA perhaps have? - So this is where private intelligence has both a strength and a weakness. The ultimate law overriding that's overseeing private intelligence is not government legislation. It's the law of economics. If they produce a superior product, then they will have a buyer. If they do not produce a superior product, they will not have a buyer. And that's a very simple\nbusiness principle. Whereas in the current national\nsecurity infrastructure, you can create a crap product, but the taxpayer dollars are\nalways going to be spent. So it's really thrown things for a loop, especially during the\nTrump administration. And this is one of the things\nthat I will always say I liked about the Trump administration. It put a big blazing bright light on all of the flaws within our system. One of those flaws being\nthis executive power over the intelligence organizations and the lack of accountability for intelligence organizations to produce a superior product. When that light got shown down, that's when you also saw\nTrump start to go after. If you remember, there was a period where he was taking\nsecurity clearances away from retiring officers. That became a big, hot issue. That became something that\npeople were very opposed to when they didn't realize that that process of taking security clearances away, that incentivized seasoned senior officers to stay in service. Because with private\nintelligence paying a premium during the Trump administration, because Trump was paying a premium to the private intelligence world. When senior officers found\nthat it was more profitable to retire early, keep their clearance and go work for Raytheon, Trump saw that as bypassing service\nto the American people. You've made a career in CIA,\nyou've made a career in NSA, you should stay there. If you leave, you lose your clearance because you no longer have a need to know. He upset the apple cart with that. And unfortunately, the narrative\nthat came out in many ways was a negative narrative against Trump, when in fact he was actually\ndoing quite a service to the American people trying\nto take away the incentive of senior officials leaving\ntheir service in order to just profiteer in the\nprivate intelligence world. - So in that way, he was\nkind of supporting the CIA in making sure that competent people and experience people stay\nand say are incentivized to stay there. - Correct, I think that\nthere was definitely, he understood incentives. I mean, Donald Trump\nunderstands incentives. So he was trying to\nincentivize them to stay, but I think he was also\nplaying a safety card because he didn't want\nformer CIA officials who were not listening to him to then move into private\nintel organizations that he may be hiring only to then have them undermine\nhim from both sides of the coin. So there was a little bit\nof offensive calculation in there as well. - But do the dynamics and the incentives of\neconomics that you refer to, that the private\nintelligence operates under, is that more or less\nethical than the forces that maybe government\nagencies operate under? Like what's your intuition?\nIs capitalism lead? So you mentioned it leads to\nmaximizations of efficiency and performance, but\nis that correlated with ethical behavior when we're talking about such hairy activities like\ncollection of intelligence? - The question of ethics\nis a great question. So let me start this\nwhole thing out by saying, CIA hires people on a spectrum of our ability to be morally\nflexible, ethically flexible. All people at their heart\nare ethically flexible. I would never punch\nsomebody in the face. Right? Some people out there would say, \"I would never hurt another human being.\" But as soon as a human\nbeing posed a direct threat to their daughter or their son or their mother, now all of\na sudden they're gonna change their ethical stance\nin self-defense. Right? But at the end of the day, it's still hurting another person. So what CIA looks for is people\nwho are able to swing across that spectrum for lesser offenses. More flexibility, I do not\nbelieve that private intelligence and the laws of economics lend themselves to increased ethics or increased ethical\nbehavior in the short term. But what ends up happening\nis that in the long term, in order to scale economic\nbenefits, you are forced to act within norms of your customer base. So as the norms of that customer base dictates certain requirements, the company has to adapt\nto those requirements in order to continue to scale. So if a company tries to ostracize LGBTQ, or if they try to ostracize men or ostracized women, they're\nlimiting their ability to grow economically. They have to adapt to whatever is the prevailing\nethical requirement of their customer base. - That's such an interesting question 'cause you look at big pharma\nand pharmaceutical companies and they have a quite a poor\nreputation in the public eye. And some of it, maybe\nmuch of it is deserved, at least historically speaking. And so you start to wonder,\nwell, can intelligence agencies use some of the same technique\nto manipulate the public, like what they believe about\nthose agencies in order to maximize profit as well,\nsort of finding shortcuts or unethical paths that allow you to not be ultimately responsible to the customer. - Absolutely and I would go\na step further to say that the covert nature of\nintelligence operations is really attractive when it\ncomes to the private sector because now they have\nall the same money with none of the oversight, and all\nthey have to do is deliver. So without the oversight,\nwhat's holding you back? And for anybody who's ever run a business, anybody who's ever started a startup or tried to make something succeed, we all know that there come\nthose times where you have to skirt the boundaries of proprietary or morality or commitments\nor promises to other people. Because at the end of the day, if your business fails, it's on you. So if you promise to deliver\nsomething to a client, you've gotta deliver it to the client. Even if that means you stay up late or if you lie on your\ntaxes, whatever it might be, there's a certain level of do or die. - Yeah, I personally have\na sort of optimistic view that ultimately the best way is to stay within the ethical bounds, kind of like what you suggested,\nif you want to be a company that's extremely successful,\nis win with competence, not with cheating. 'Cause cheating won't, I\nbelieve, win in the long term. But in terms of being publicly responsible to your decisions, I mean, I've already been supposed to talk to Peter Thiel twice on this podcast, and it's just been complicated. (Andrew laughing) If I were to put myself into his shoes, why do podcasts? The risk is too high to\nbe a public person at all. And so I totally understand that. At the same time, I think\nif you are doing things by the book and you're the best in the world at your job, then you have nothing to worry about. And you can advertise that and you help recruit. I mean, that's the work of capitalism is you want to advertise\nthat this is the place where the best people in the\nworld at this thing work. - True. I think that your\npoint of view is accurate. I would also say that the complexities of what\nmakes somebody make a decision can only really be properly\ncalculated with a baseline. So because there is no baseline that you or I have on Peter Thiel, it's difficult to really ascertain why he does or doesn't accept invites or why he does or doesn't appear. - Well, let me ask your opinion on the NSA and then maybe we could\nmention about bulk collection in general in the CIA, but, you know, let's look at some history with the NSA and Snowden. What's your opinion on\nthe mass surveillance that is reported to have been conducted by the NSA? We talked about ethics. Are you troubled from\nof a public perception, the unethical nature of mass surveillance of\nespecially American citizens? - This is a topic that I never\nget tired of talking about, but it's very rare that anyone\never really agrees with me. Just so you know. (both laughing) - I think there's a nuance thing here. Maybe we'll find some agreement. - The truth is that\nthe American experience after 9/11 is nothing like\nthe American experience now. So all the terminology,\nall this talk about privacy and privacy laws and mass surveillance and all this other stuff,\nit was a completely different time then. And that's not to say it was an excuse, because to this day, I will\nstill say mass collection, bulk collection of data that allows for an expedient\nidentification of a threat to national security benefits all of us. But people don't\nunderstand what they want. Like people don't\nunderstand what the value of their own privacy is. First of all, the fact that people think they have personal privacy is laughable. You have no privacy. The cell phone that you\ncarry in your pocket, you're giving permission\nto those apps constantly. You're giving commercial\norganizations, what you and I have already said are less tied to ethical responsibility. You're giving them permission\nto collect enormous amounts of private data from you all the time. And do you know what happens\nif AT&T or Verizon sees some nefarious activity on your account? They do nothing. They might send a note to FBI because they have to\naccording to some checklist. But when NSA was collecting\nintelligence on metadata from around the United States,\nthey were very specifically looking for terrorist threats that would harm American lives. Man, NSA can clone my phone. I will give them my children's phone. I will give them the passwords\nto every one of my accounts if it means that there's a likelihood that my family will be\nsafer from a nefarious actor whose intent on hurting us. NSA doesn't care about your affair. NSA doesn't care if you're\ncheating on your taxes. NSA doesn't care if you\ntalk about shit your boss or if you hate the US President,\nnobody cares about that. Your intelligence community\nis there to find threats to national security. That's what they're there to do. What Snowden did when he\nouted that whole program, the fact that the court,\nthe justice system, the civilian justice system went back and essentially overruled the ruling of the intelligence courts\nbefore them, just goes to show how the general mass community\nreally shouldn't have a say in what happens in the\nintelligence community. They really shouldn't. You have politicians and\nyou have the opportunity to elect people to a position\nand then you trust them. That's what a representative republic is. You vote the people in, you trust them to work on your behalf. They make decisions\nwithout running 'em by you. They make decisions that they believe are in the best interest\nof their constituency. And that's how our form\nof democracy works. It worked. We were safer. Now that we don't have that information and now that there's this giant\nlooming question of whether or not NSA is there to serve people or is collecting mass surveillance against all American people, that's not really a true\naccurate representation of what they were ever doing. They were looking for\nthe needle in a haystack of the series of transactions\nin metadata that was going to lead to American deaths. We are now less secure\nbecause they can't do that. And that bothers me. - So you said a few really\ninteresting things there. So because you are kind of an\ninsider, at war for a time, an insider, meaning you were able to build up an intuition\nabout the good, the bad, and the ugly of these institutions,\nspecifically the good. A lot of people don't have\na good sense of the good. They know the bad and the ugly or can infer the bad and the ugly. You mentioned that the one\nlittle key little thing there at the end saying the NSA doesn't care about whether you hate\nthe president or not. Now that's what people really worry about, is they're not sure they\ncan trust the government to not go into full dictatorial mode. And based on your political\npreference, your oppositions, your basically one of the essential powers the freedom of speech in the United States is the ability to\ncriticize your government. And they worry well, can't the government get ahold of the NSA and start to ask the basic question, well, can you gimme a list of people that are criticizing the government? - So let's just walk through that exact example, right? Because it's a preponderance. It's a preponderance fear. It's a ridiculous fear because you would have to\ntap on multiple elements of government for anything to happen. So for example, let's just say\nthat somebody goes to the NSA and says, \"Hey, can you give\nus a readout on all the people who are tweeting terrible\nthings about the president?\" Okay, cool, here's your\na hundred million people, whatever it is, right? Here's all the people\nsaying negative things about the government. So now they have a list.\nWhat do they do next? Well, let's just make it simple. They stay with NSA and they\nsay, \"Surveil them even more. Tap their phones, tap their computers. I wanna know even more.\" So then they get this\npreponderance of evidence. What do you do with evidence?\nYou take it to a court. Well, guess what? No court is going to support anything that goes against the freedom of speech. So the court is not going to support what the executive is asking them to do. Even before you take somebody to court, you have to involve law enforcement. Essentially you have to send\nsome sort of police force to go apprehend the\nindividual who's in question. Well, guess what doesn't meet criteria for any police force anywhere\nin the United States? Arresting people who say negative things about the president. Now, if somebody poses\na threat to the life of a public figure or the\nthreat to life of a politician, that's a completely different case. Which means the standards\nof evidence are much higher for them to arrest that person. So unless you create\na secret police force, then your actual public police force is never gonna take action. So all these people who are afraid of this exact situation that you're outlying, they need the creation\nof a secret police force. The creation of a secret\ncourt that operates outside the judicial system, the creation of a secret intelligence\nservice that operates outside of foreign intelligence collection. All so that a handful of people\nwho don't like the president get what whisked away,\nassassinated, put in prison, who knows what. Think about the resources,\nthe amount of money and time and how hard would it\nbe to keep that secret, to have all of those things in motion. The reason it worked in\nRussia and Soviet, Germany or Russia and Communist Germany was because everybody knew\nthere was a secret police. Everybody knew that like, that\nthere was a threat to work to speaking out against the government. It's completely different here. - Well, so there's a lot to say. So one is yes, if I was a\ndictator and I wanted to, and just looking at history, let me take myself out of it. But I think one of the more effective ways is you don't need the surveillance. You can pick out a random person and in a public display,\nsemi-public display, you know, basically put 'em in jail for opposing the government,\nwhether they oppose it or not. And the fear that sends a\nmessage to a lot of people. - That's exactly what you\nsee happening in China. What you just laid out. It's genius. And that is the standard bottle. - You don't need the\nsurveillance for that. But that said, if you\ndid do the surveillance, so that's the support, the sort of the incentives aren't aligned. It seems like a lot of work to do for the thing you could do\nwithout the surveillance. But you know, yes, the courts wouldn't, if you were to be able\nto get a list of people, which I think that part you could do. That opposed the government,\nyou could do that just like you said on Twitter publicly, you could make a list. And with that you can start to, especially if you have a\nlot of data on those people find ways in which they\ndid violate the law. Not because they opposed the government, but because in some other\nway the parking tickets or didn't pay the taxes. That's probably a common one. Or like screwed up\nsomething about the taxes. I just happen to know Russia and Ukraine, they're very good at this kind of stuff. Knowing we how the citizens\nscrewed everything up. Because especially in those countries, everybody's breaking the law because in a corrupt nation, you have to bend the law to operate. Like the number of people\nthat pay taxes fully in those nations is just\nvery low, if not zero. And so they then use that\nbreaking of the law to come up with an excuse to actually\nput you in jail based on that. So it is possible to imagine. But yes, I think that's the ugly part of surveillance. But I do think, just like you said, the incentives aren't correct. Like you really don't need to\nget all of the secret police and all of these kinds\nof organizations working. If you do have a\ncharismatic, powerful leader that built up a network\nthat's able to control a lot of organizations to\na level of authoritarianism in a government, they're just able to do the usual thing. One, have propaganda\nmachine to tell narratives. Two, pick out, you know, people\nthat they can put in jail for opposing the state and maybe loud members of the press start silencing the press. There's a playbook to this thing, and that doesn't require the surveillance. The surveillance, you know, what is useful for the surveillance is the\nthing you mentioned in China, which is encourage everybody in the citizenry to watch each\nother to say there's enemies of the state everywhere. And then you start\nhaving children reporting on their parents and that kind of stuff. Again, don't need a\nsurveillance state for that. Now, the good of a surveillance system, if it's operating within\nethical bounds, is that yes, it could protect the populace. So you're saying like the good,\ngiven on your understanding of these institutions, the\ngood outweighs the bad? - Absolutely. So lemme give\nyou just a practical example. So people don't realize this, but there's multiple surveillance\nstates that are out there. There are surveillance states that are close allies\nwith the United States. One of those surveillance states is the United Arab Emirates, the UAE. Now I lived in the UAE from 2019 to 2020. Came back on a repatriation\nflight after Covid broke out. But we were there for a full year. We were residents, we had\nIDs, we had everything. Now, when you get your\nnational ID in the Emirates, you get a chip and that chip\nconnects you to everything. It connects you to\ncameras, it connects you to your license plate on your car, to your passport, to your\ncredit card, everything. Everything is intertwined. Everything is interlinked. When you drive, there are no police, there are no police on the roads. Every 50 to 100 meters you cross a camera that reads your license plate, measures your speed, and if you're breaking the speed limit, it just immediately\ncharges your credit card because it's all tied\ntogether, totally surveillance. That technology was invented by the Israelis who use it in Israel. When I was in Abu Dhabi, and I was rear-ended at high\nspeed by what turned out to be an Emirati official, a senior ranking official\nof one of the Emirates. It was caught on camera. His ID was registered,\nmy ID was registered, everything was tied back to our IDs. The proof and the evidence\nwas crystal clear. Even still, he was Emirati. I was not. So when I went to the police\nstation to file the complaints, it was something that\nnobody was comfortable with because generally speaking, Emiratis don't accept legal claims against their own from foreigners. But the difference was\nthat I was an American and I was there on a contract supporting the Emirati government. So I had these different variances, right? Long story short, in the\nend, the surveillance states is what made sure that justice was played because the proof was incontrovertible. There was so much evidence collected because of the surveillance\nnature of their state. Now why do they have a surveillance state? It's not for people like me. It's because they're constantly afraid of extremist terrorist activity happening inside Abu Dhabi or inside the UAE because they're under\nconstant threat from Islam or from extremists. And they're under\nconstant threat from Iran. So that's what drives the\npeople to want a police state to want a surveillance state. For them, their survival is paramount and they need the surveillance\nto have that survival. For us, we haven't tasted\nthat level of desperation and fear yet, or hopefully never. But that's what makes us\nfeel like there's something wrong with surveillance. Surveillance is all about the purpose. It's all about the intent. - Well, and like you said, companies do a significant\namount of surveillance to provide us with services\nthat we take for granted. For example, just one of\nthe things to give props to the digital efforts of the Zelensky administration in Ukraine, I don't know if you're aware, but they have this digital\ntransformation efforts where you could put, like, it's laughable to say\nin the United States, but they actually did a really good job of having a government app\nthat has your passport on it. It's all the digital information\nyou can get a doctor. It's like everything that you would think America\nwould be doing, you know, like license, like all that kind of stuff. It's in an app, you could pay each other. There's payment to each\nother, and that's all coming. I mean, there's probably\ncontractors somehow connected to the whole thing, but that's like under\nthe flag of government. And so that's an incredible technology. And I didn't, I guess, hear anybody talk about\nsurveillance in that context, even though it is. But they all love it and it's super easy. And frankly already, it's\nso easy and convenient they've already taken for granted that of course, this is what you do. Of course your passport is on your phone. - Yep, for everybody to have, housed in a server that you\nhave no idea where it's at. That could be hacked at\nany time by a third party. - They don't ask these kinds of questions because it's so convenient. As we do for Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Microsoft products we use. - Security and convenience\nare on two opposite sides of another spectrum. The more convenient something\nis, the less secure. And the more secure something\nis the less convenient. And that's a battle that we're always working with as individuals and then we're trying to outsource that battle to our politicians. And our politicians are frankly just more interested in being politicians. - Yeah, that said, I mean,\npeople are really worried about giving any one institution\na large amount of power, especially when it's a\nfederal government institution given some history. First of all, just\nhistory of the corruption, of power corrupting\nindividuals and institutions. And second of all, myth or reality of certain institutions\nlike the CIA misbehaving. Well, let me actually ask\nyou about the Edward Snowden. So outside of the utility\nthat you're arguing for of the NSA surveillance program, do you think Edward Snowden\nis a criminal or a hero? - In terms in the eyes of the law? He's a criminal. He broke the law. He broke the confidence. He was under security obligation. And then when he ran\naway, he ran away to all of the worst villains in the\nworld from the US perspective to basically seek protection. How you act in the face of accusation is in essence part of the case that you build for yourself. So running away to China, Russia, Cuba, there was a Latin Ecuador I think, that just paints a very negative picture that does not suggest that\nyou were doing anything that was ethical and upright and in favor of the American people if you're gonna run to American\nenemies to support yourself. So for sure in the eyes\nof law, he's a criminal. In the eyes of a group of people who are largely ignorant\nto what they lost. To them, he's a hero. To me, he's just kind of a sad case. I personally look at Snowden\nas a sad, unfortunate case. His life is ruined. His\nfamily name is tarnished. He's forever going to be a desperate pawn. And that's all because of\nthe decisions that he made and the order that he made them. - I'm not sure his name is tarnished. I think the case you're making\nis a difficult case to make. And so I think his name represents fighting one man. It's like Tiananmen Square\nstanding before the tank. Is like one man fighting the government. And I think that there is\nsome aspect to which taking that case aside, that\nis the American spirit, which is hold the powerful accountable. So whenever there's somebody in power, one individual can change can... - One man can make a difference. - [Lex] Can make a difference. - It's very \"Night Rider\" of you. (Andrew laughing)\n- It's powerful. Well, I mean that's the\nAmerican individualism. And so he represents that. And I think there's a huge skepticism against large federal institutions. And I think if you look at\nthe long arc of history, that actually is a forcing\nfunction for the institutions to behave their best. So basically hold them accountable. - What's nice about this is\nthat we can agree to disagree and history will be the one that decides. But like there's a reason that Edward Snowden\nneeds to do something new every 16 or 18 months to remain relevant. Because if he didn't, he\nwould just be forgotten. Because he was not a maverick who changed history for the better. He was a man who broke a\nlaw and now he's on the run. And to some people, he is a hero. To other people, he's a criminal. But to the vast majority,\nhe's just a blip on a radar of their everyday life that really makes no difference to them at all. - So actually let's linger on that. So just to clarify, are you making the difficult case that the NSA mass surveillance\nprogram was one, ethical and two, made a better\nworld for Americans? - I am making the case that\nat the time it was exactly what we needed to feel\nsafe in our own homes. - But what about to be\nsafe, actually be safe? - So this is what's difficult because any proof that they collected that actually prevented\nan attack from happening is proof we'll never know about. This is the really unfortunate side of intelligence operations, and I've been at the front end of this. You work your ass off,\nyou take personal risk, you make personal sacrifice to make sure that something terrible doesn't happen. Nobody knows that that ever happens. - Does that have to be that way? Does it have to remain\nsecret every time the NSA or the CIA saves the lives of Americans? - It does for two reasons.\nIt has to be secret first. The mythos, the same thing\nwe were talking about with General Petraeus. You can't brag about your victories if you want to let the myth\nshape itself, you can't do that. The second thing is, once a victory is claimed, the danger comes from\nletting your enemy know that you claimed the victory. Because they can reverse engineer and they can start to\nchange how they did things. If a terrorist cell tries\nto execute an operation, the operation fails. From their point of view,\nthey don't know why it failed. They just know that it failed. But then if the US or if the American government comes in and says, \"We took apart\nthis amazing attack\", now they have more information. The whole power of secrets,\nlike we talked about before, the power of secrets is in knowing that not everybody has them. There's only a shelf life. So take advantage of the shelf life. You get space. So you\ngotta keep it a secret. There is no tactical advantage\nfrom sharing a secret unless you are specifically trying to achieve a certain tactical\nadvantage from sharing that secret, which is\nwhat we've seen so much of with US intel sharing with Ukraine. There's a tactical advantage\nfrom sharing a secret about Russian military movements\nor weaknesses in tanks or, you know, supply chain\nchallenges, whatever it might be. - Well, let me argue that\nthere might be an advantage to share information\nwith the American public when a terrorist attack is averted or the lives\nof Americans are saved. Because what that does... - Is make every American think\nthat they're not that safe. There is no tactical advantage there. - [Lex] You think so?\n- Absolutely. If the Austin PD started\ntelling you every day about these crazy crimes that they prevented, would that make you feel more safe? It would make you feel like\nthey're doing their job. - Is that obvious to you? Make us feel less safe? 'Cause if we see competence that there is extremely competent\ndefenders of this territory, of these people, wouldn't that\nmake us feel more safe or no? - The human nature is\nnot to assign competence. So empirically humans overvalue losses and undervalue gains. That's something that we've seen from finance to betting and beyond. If the Austin Police\nDepartment starts telling you about all these heinous\ncrimes that were avoided because of their hard work, the way that your brain is\nactually going to process that information is you are going to say, if this is all the stuff\nthat they've stopped, how bad must this place be? How much more haven't they stopped? - I take your point. It's a powerful psychological point, but I, looking at the other picture of it, looking at the police force,\nlooking at the CIA, the NSA, those people and now with the police, there's such a negative feeling amongst Americans towards\nthese institutions. Who the hell wants to work for the CIA now and the police force? Like you're gonna be criticized. Like that's really bad for the CIA. - [Andrew] It's terrible. - Like, as opposed to\nbeing seen as a hero. Like for example, currently soldiers are for the most part seen as heroes that are protecting this nation. That's not the case for the CIA - Soldiers weren't seen as\nheroes in the Vietnam War. You've gotta remember that\nwhen you, so first of all, public service is a sacrifice. We oftentimes forget that. We start to think, oh,\ngovernment jobs are cushy and they're easy. And it must be so easy to be the president 'cause then you're basically\na celebrity overnight. Public service is a sacrifice. It's a grind. For all of the soldiers, the\nsubmariners, the missiles, the police officers,\nintelligence specialists, they all know what it's\nlike to give things up to serve a public that\ncan turn its opinion at any given time. And history is what defines it. The more important thing is to understand that if you want a true\nopen and fair democracy, you cannot control a narrative and starting to share\nall of your victories or starting to share\nyour biggest victories with the intent of shaping public opinion, to be supportive of the police\nforce or supportive of CIA or supportive of you name\nit, is shaping a narrative that is intentional,\noperational use of influence to drive public opinion. That is something nobody\nwants to get into. It is much more professional\nto be a silent sentinel, a silent servant, humbly\ncarrying the burden of public service in the United States where we are AU, bear and open democracy. - Why not celebrate\n(Andrew laughing) the killing of Bin Laden?\n- [Andrew] We did. - The search, discovery and the capture and the killing of Bin Laden. Actually the details of that, how much of the details of that, how he was discovered were made public? I think some of it was made public enough. Why not do that? Doesn't that make heroes out of the people that are servants? Do people who serve, do\nservice for this nation, do they always have to operate in a thankless manner in the shadows? - I think that's a very good question. The folks who I left\nbehind when I left CIA, who continue to serve as faceless, nameless heroes every day,\nI am grateful to them. The truth is that if they were motivated by something else, they\nwouldn't be as good as they are at doing what they do. And I see your point about shouldn't we be celebrating our victories? But when celebrating our\nvictories runs the risk of informing our enemies, how we operate, giving away\nour informational advantage, giving away our tactical\nbattlefield advantage, and running the risk of shaping\na narrative intentionally among our own American people. Now all of a sudden we're\nturning into exactly the thing that the American people\ntrust us not to become. - Yeah. but then you\noperate in the secrecy, and then there's corrupt and\ndouchebag people everywhere. So when they, even inside the CIA and criminals inside the CIA, there's criminals in all organizations, in all walks of life. Human nature is such that\nthis is always the case. Then it breeds conspiracy theories. - It does and sometimes\nthose conspiracy theories turn out to be true, but\nmost times they don't. That's just part of the\nrisk of being a myth. - Can you speak to some of\nthe myths? So MKUltra... - Not a myth. - Not a myth, so this is a\nfascinating human experimentation program undertaken by the\nCIA to develop procedures for using drugs like LSD to\ninterrogate people through, let's say, psychological manipulation and maybe even torture. The scale of the program\nis perhaps not known. How do you make sense\nthat this program existed? - Again, you've gotta look\nthrough the lens of time. You've gotta look at where we were historically at that time. There was the peak of the Cold War. Our enemies were doing the\nsame kind of experimentation. It was essentially another space race. What if they broke through\na new weapon technology faster than we did? What would that mean for the safety and security of the American people? So right decision or wrong\ndecision, it was guided by and informed by national\nsecurity priorities. So from this program that\nwas designed to use drugs to drive interrogation and torture people, was born something very\nproductive, Operation Stargate, which was a chance to use remote viewing and metaphysics to try\nto collect intelligence. Now, even though in the\nend the outcome of MKUltra and the outcome of Stargate were mixed, nobody really knows if they did or didn't do what they\nwere supposed to do. We still know that to this\nday, there's still a demand in the US government and in CIA for people who have sensitivities\nto ethereal energies. - By the way, is there any proof that that kind of stuff works? It shows that there's interest, it shows that there's openness to consider those kinds of things. But is there any evidence\nthat that kind of stuff works? - If there's evidence, I haven't seen it. Speaking from a science-based\npoint of view only, if energy and matter\ncan always be exchanged, then a person who can understand and become sensitive to\nenergy is a person who could become sensitive to\nwhat does become matter. - Yeah, I mean, the basics of\nthe physics might be there, but a lot of people\nprobably are skeptical. - I'm skeptical too, but\nI'm just trying to remain... - But you should be open-minded, right? I mean, that's actually, you know, that's what science is\nabout, is remain open-minded, even for the things that are long shots, because those are the things that actually define\nscientific revolutions. What about Operation Northwoods? It was a proposed 1962\nfalse flag operation by the DOD and the CIA to\nbe carried out by the CIA to commit acts of terrorism on Americans and blame them on Cuba. So JFK, the president\nrejected the proposal. What do you make that this was on the table, Operation Northwoods. - So it's interesting. First\nI'm glad that JFK rejected it. That's a good sign. So we have to understand that good ideas are oftentimes\nborn from bad ideas. I had a really good friend\nof mine who actually went on to become a pastor, and he\nused to say all the time that he wanted all the\nbad ideas on the table. Like \"Gimme all your bad ideas\" every time we had any\nkind of conversation. And I was always one of\nthose people who was like, isn't a bad idea just a waste of time? And he was like, \"No 'cause\nthe best ideas oftentimes come from bad ideas.\" So again, Cuban Missile Crisis, mass hysteria in the United\nStates about nuclear war from Cuba, missiles\nblowing up American cities faster than we could even see them coming. It makes sense to me that\na president would go to, especially the part of CIA, which is the special activities division. It makes perfect sense to\nme that a president would go to a division called special activities, whose job it is to create,\nyou know, crazy ideas that have presidential approval, but nobody knows they exist. So it makes sense that he would\nchallenge a group like that to come up with any wacky idea, right? Come up with anything. Just\nlet's start with something. 'Cause we can't bring\nnothing to the table. We have to do something\nabout this Cuban issue. And then that's how an operation like that could reasonably be born. Not because anybody wants to do it, but because they were tasked\nby the president to come up with five ideas. And it was one of the ideas. That still happens to this day. The president will still come in, but it'll basically send out a notice to his covert action arm and he will say, \"I need this and I need it on Wednesday.\" And people have to come back with options for the thing he asked for, a finding. He will issue a presidential finding, and then his covert action\narms have to come back and say, \"Here's how we would do this.\" And hide the hands of the Americans. - How gangster was it of\nJFK to reject it though? - It was baller, right?\n(Lex laughing) That is a mic drop right there. Nope, not doing that. Yep, doing that. - You know, a thing that\ncrosses an ethical line, even in a time where the entirety of human civilization hangs in a balance, still forfeit that power. That's a beautiful thing about the American experiment. A few times throughout its history that's has happened, including with our first President\nGeorge Washington. Well, let me ask about JFK. (Andrew laughing) - 25 times two, and they still\nkeep that stuff classified. - So do you think the CIA had a hand in\nthe assassination of JFK? - I cannot imagine in any\nreasonable point of view that the organization of\nCIA had anything to do with the assassination of JFK. - So it's not possible to infiltrate a small part of the CIA in\norder to attain political or criminal gains or financial? - Yeah, absolutely it's\npossible to infiltrate CIA, there's a long history of\nforeign intelligence services infiltrating CIA from\nAldrich Ames to Jerry Lee, recently with China. So we know CIA can be infiltrated. Even if they are infiltrated, and even if that's interlocutor executes on their own agenda or the agenda as directed\nby their foreign adversary, their foreign handler, that's different than organizational support for an event. So I do think it's possible\nthey could have been infiltrated at the time, especially, it was a massive, a major priority for the\nCubans and the Russians to infiltrate some aspect\nof US intelligence. Multiple moles were caught\nin the years following. So it's not surprising that there would be a priority for that. But to say that the organization of CIA was somehow in cahoots to independently assassinate\ntheir own executive, that's a significant stretch. I've seen no evidence to support that. And it goes contrary to everything I learned\nfrom my time at CIA. - Well, let me ask you, do you think CIA played a\npart in enabling drug cartels and drug trafficking, which is another big kind of shadow that hangs over the CIA. - At the beginning of the drug war, I would imagine the answer is yes. CIA has its own\ncounter-narcotics division. A division that's dedicated to fighting and preventing narcotics from\ncoming into the United States. So when you paint a picture for me, like do you think the CIA was complicit in helping drug trafficking or drug use? When I say yes, my exception\nis I don't think they did that for Americans inside the United States. If the CIA can basically set it up so that two different drug\ncartels shoot each other by assisting in the transaction of a sale to a third country and then leaking that that sale happened to a competing cartel, that's just letting\ncartels do what they do. That's them doing the dirty work for us. So, especially at the\nbeginning of the drug war, I think there was tons of\nspace, lots of room for CIA to get involved in the economics of drugs and then let the inevitable happen. And that was way more efficient, way more productive than us\ntrying to send our own troops in to kill a bunch of cartel warlords. So that makes a ton of sense to me. It just seems efficient,\nit seems very practical. I do not believe that CIA would like, I don't think all the\naccusations out there about how they would\nbuy drugs and sell drugs and somehow make money\non the side from it. That's not how it works. - So do you think, on\nthat point, a connection between Barry Seal, the great governor, and then President Bill\nClinton, Oliver North and vice president, former\nCA director George H.W. Bush in a little town with a little airport called Mena, Arkansas. - So I am outta my element now. This is one I haven't\nheard many details about. - So your sense is any\nof the drug trafficking has to do with criminal operations\noutside the United States and the CIA just leveraging that to achieve its end, but nothing\nto do with American citizens and American politicians - With American citizens, again,\nspeaking organizationally. So that would be my sense. Yes. - Let me ask you about, so\nback to Operation Northwoods, because it's such a powerful tool, sadly powerful tool used by\ndictators throughout history, the false flag operation. So I think there's, and you said the terrorist attacks in 9/11 changed a lot for us, for the United States, for Americans. It changed the way we see the world. It woke us up to the\nharshness of the world. I think there's, to my eyes\nat least, there's nothing that shows evidence that 9/11\nwas a quote \"inside job.\" But is the CIA or the intelligence agencies or the US government capable\nof something like that? (Andrew laughing) I mean, that's the question.\n- I get it, yeah. - So there's a bunch of shadiness about how was reported on. I just can't, that's the\nthing I struggle with. While there's no evidence\nthat there was an inside job, it raises the question to me, well, could something like\nthis be an inside job? 'cause it's sure as heck,\nnow, looking back 20 years, the amount of money that\nwas spent on these wars, the military industrial complex, the amount of interest in terms of power and money involved, organizationally, can\nsomething like that happen? - You know Occam's razor. So the harems razor is that\nyou can never prescribe to conspiracy what could be\nexplained through incompetence. Those are two fundamental guidelines that we follow all the time. The simplest answer is oftentimes the best and never prescribe to conspiracy what can be explained\nthrough incompetence. - Can you elaborate what you\nmean by we? As human beings? - [Andrew] We, as\nintelligence professionals. - So you think there's a deep\ntruth to that second razor? - There us more than a deep truth. There's ages of experience\nfor me and for others. - So in general, people are incompetent. If left to their own means, they're more incompetent\nthan they are malevolent at a large organizational scale. - People are more incompetent\nof executing a conspiracy than they are of competently, yeah, than they are of competently\nexecuting a conspiracy. That's really what it means,\nis that it's so difficult to carry out a complex lie that most people don't have\nthe competency to do it. So it doesn't make any sense\nto lead thinking of conspiracy. It makes more sense to\nlead assuming incompetence. When you look at all of the outcomes, all the findings from 9/11,\nit speaks to incompetence, it speaks brashly and\nopenly to incompetence, and nobody likes talking about it. FBI and CIA to this day\nhate hearing about it. The 9/11 commission is\ngonna go down in history as this painful example\nof the incompetence of the American intelligence community. And it's going to come\nback again and again. Every time there's an intel flap, it's gonna come back again and again. What are you seeing? Even right now, we missed the\nUS intelligence infrastructure misjudged Afghanistan,\nmisjudged Hong Kong, misjudged Ukraine's, and\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine. Those were three massive\nmisjudgments in a few years. - It's just embarrassing to the end. - It's just embarrassing. Exactly right. - So all the sort of\ncoverup looking things around 9/11 is just\npeople being embarrassed by their failures. - If they're taking steps\nto cover anything up, it's just their own. It's a painful reminder of their lack of competency at the time. Now, I understand that\nconspiracy theorists want to take inklings of information and put them together in a way that is the most damning. But that goes back to our\npoint about overvaluing losses and undervaluing gains. It's just predictable human behavior. - Let me ask you about this,\nbecause it comes up often. So I'm from MIT and there's a guy by the\nname of Jeffrey Epstein that still troubles me to this day. That some of the people\nI respect were interacted with this individual and fell into his influence, charm, charisma, whatever the hell he used\nto delude these people. He did so successfully. I'm very open-minded about this thing. I would love to learn more, but a lot of people tell me,\na lot of people outta respect that there's intelligence\nagencies behind this individual. So they were using Jeffrey\nEpstein for getting access to people and then to control and manipulate those powerful people. The CIA, I believe is not\nbrought up as often as Mossad. And so this goes back\nto the original aspect of our conversation is how much each individual\nintelligence agency is willing to go to control, to manipulate, to achieve its means. Do you think there is,\ncan you educate me if obviously you don't know, but you can bet. What are the chances the\nintelligence agencies are involved with the character of Jeffrey Epstein - In some way, shape or form\nwith the character of Epstein? It's 100% guaranteed.\n- [Lex] Ah dammit. - That some intelligence\norganization was involved. But let's talk about why. Let's talk about why, okay? There's multiple types\nof intelligence assets, just like we were talking earlier. There's foreign intelligence\nreporting assets, there's access agents, and then\nthere's agents of influence. Three different categories\nof intelligence, right? One is a, when you talk about foreign intelligence reporters, these are people who\nhave access to secrets and their job is to give you\ntheir secrets in exchange for gold or money or alcohol or prostitution or whatever else, right? Their job is to give you secrets and then you pay them for the secrets. Access agents, their job is\nto give you physical access or digital access to\nsomething of interest to you. So maybe they're the ones that open a door that should have been\nlocked and let you come in and stick your thumb\ndrive in the computer. Or maybe they're the ones that share a phone number with somebody and then they're just like, just don't tell 'em you got\nthe phone number from me. Their job is to give you access. Then you have these agents of influence. An agent of influence's job is to be part of your effort to influence the outcomes in some way that benefits your intelligence\nrequirements, right? Of these three types of people, the least scrupulous and the most shady is\nyour agent of influence. Because your agent of influence understands exactly what they're doing. They know they're working with one guy, and they know they're using the influence to manipulate some other guy. When it comes to powerful people, especially wealthy, powerful people, the only thing that\ninterests them is power. Money is not a challenge anymore. Prestige, notoriety, none of\nthose things are a challenge. The rest of us, we're\nbusy trying to make money. We're busy trying to build a reputation. We're busy trying to build a career, keep a family afloat. At the highest levels, they're bored. They don't need any of that. The only thing that\nthey care about is being able to wield power. So a character like\nJeffrey Epstein is exactly the kind of character that\nthe Chinese would want, the Russians would\nwant, Mossad would want, the French would want. It's too easy because the man had access to a wide range of American influential people\nfor corporate espionage uses, for economic espionage uses, for national security espionage uses. It doesn't make any sense\nthat a person like that wouldn't be targeted. It doesn't. - So the question is who and whether I think the really important distinction here is, was Jeffrey Epstein created,\nor once he's achieved and built his network,\nwas he then infiltrated? And that's a really sort\nof important difference. Like at which stage do you\nconnect a person like that? You start to notice\nmaybe they're effective of building a network and then you start building a relationship to where at some point it's a\njob, they're working for you. Or do you literally\ncreate a person like that? - Yeah, so intelligence organizations have different strategies here. In the United States, we never create, we don't have a budget cycle\nthat allows us to create, I mean, the maximum budget\ncycle in the United States is five years. So even if we were to try to\ninvest in some seed operation or create some character of influence, essentially every year you have to justify why you're spending budget. And that becomes very difficult\nin a democracy like ours. However, Russia and\nChina are extremely adept at seed operations, long-term operations. They are willing to invest and develop and create an agent that\nserves their purposes. Now, to create someone from\nscratch, like Jeffrey Epstein, the probabilities are extremely low. They would've had to start with like a thousand different targets and try to grow a thousand\ndifferent, if you will, influencers, and then\nhope that one of them hits kind of like a venture\ncapital firm, right? Invest in many hope that a few hits. More likely they observed him at some point in his own natural rise. They identified his\npersonal vulnerability, very classic espionage technique. And then they stepped in,\nintroduced themselves mid-career and said, \"Hey, we know you\nhave this thing that you like, that it's frowned upon by your own people, but we don't frown upon it, and\nwe can help you both succeed and, you know, have an endless supply of ladies along the way.\" - I've recently talked to Ryan\nGraves, who's a lieutenant, Ryan Graves, who's a fighter jet pilot about many things. He also does work on autonomous\nweapon systems, drones and that kind of thing, and\nincluding quantum computing. But he also happens to be\none of the very few pilots that were willing to go on record and talk about UFO sightings. Does the CIA and the federal government\nhave interest in UFOs? - In my experience at CIA, that is an area that remains very compartmented. And that could be one of two reasons. It could be because there\nis significant interest and that's why it's so\nheavily compartmented. Or it could be because it's an area that's just not important. It's a distraction. So they compartment it\nso it doesn't distract from other operations. One of the areas that I've\nbeen quite interested in and where I've done a lot of research, and I've done some work in\nthe private intelligence and private investigation\nside, is with UFOs. The place where UFOs really connect with the federal government\nis when it comes to aviation safety and predominance of power. So FAA and the US Air Force and the US military are\nvery invested in knowing what's happening in the skies\nabove the United States. And that's of primary interest to them. When they can rule out the direct threat to national security of UFOs, then they become less interested. That said, when you have\nunexplained aerial phenomenon that are unexplained, that\ncan't directly be tied to anything that is known\nof the terrestrial world, then they're left without\nan answer to their question. They don't know if it's\na threat or not a threat. But I think the scarier concern for the US national government or for the US federal\ngovernment, the scarier concern that nobody talks about is\nwhat if the UFO isn't alien? What if it is actually a cutting edge war machine that we are eons behind ever being able to replicate? - Or the other concern\nis that it's a system, it's a machine from a foreign power that's doing intelligence collection. - [Andrew] Correct.\n- So it's not just military purposes, it's\nactually collecting data. - Well, a lot of times the\nfederal government will see the two as the same. It's a hostile tool from\na foreign government. - Oh, so collection of\ninformation is a hostile act. - Absolutely. That's why\nthe Espionage Act exists. That's why it's a criminal\noffense if you're committing espionage in the United States as a US citizen or a foreign citizen. - So I guess they keep digging until they can confirm it's not a threat. And you're saying that there's not, from your understanding much\nevidence that they're doing, so it could be because\nthey're compartmentalized, but you're saying private\nintelligence institutions are trying to make progress on this? Yeah, it's really difficult\nto know the scale. - Yeah, there's an economic interest in the private intelligence world. Because for example, if you understand why\ncertain aerial phenomenon are happening over a location,\nthen you can use that to inform investors whether\nto invest in that location or avoid investment in that location. But that's not a national\nsecurity concern. So it doesn't matter to\nthe federal government. - Could these UFOs be aliens? Now I'm going into a territory of you as a human being wondering about all the alien\ncivilizations that are out there. The humbling question. - We are not alone. - [Lex] You think we're not alone? - It's an improbability that we are alone. If by virtue of the fact that\nsentient human life exists, intelligent human life\nexists, all the probabilities that would have to be\ndestroyed for that to be true, simply speak over the galaxies that exist that there's no possible way we're alone. It's a mathematical equation.\nIt's a one or a zero. And for me, it has to exist. It's impossible otherwise,\nrationally for me to think that we are truly the\nonly intelligent life form in all of the universe. But to think that an alien life form is anything\nlike us at all, is equally as inconceivable to think\nthat there are carbon-based, bipedal, humanoid, alien\nspecies that just happen to fly around in metal machines and visit alien planets in a\nway that they become observed, it's just silly. It's the world of sci-fi. - [Lex] Well, let me push... - What does every good scientist... 'Cause we always assume that they're superior\nto us in intelligence. When any scientist\ncarries out an experiment, the whole objective of the\nexperiment is to observe without being disclosed\nor being discovered. So why on earth would we think that the superior\nspecies makes the mistake of being discovered over and over again? - So, to push back on\nthat idea, if we were to think about us humans trying\nto communicate with ants. First, we observe for a\nwhile, there'll be a bunch of PhDs written, a bunch of people just sort of collecting data, taking notes, trying to understand about\nthis thing that you detected that seems to be a living thing, which is a very difficult thing to define from an alien perspective. Or from our perspective, we find life on Mars\nor something like that. Okay, so you observe for a while, but then if you want to\nactually interact with it, how would you interact with the ants? If I were to interact with\nthe ants, I would try to infiltrate, I would try\nto put, like, figure out what is the language they used to communicate with each other. I would try to operate at\ntheir physical scale, at like, in terms of the physics of\ntheir interaction, in terms of the information methods,\nmediums of information exchange with pheromones or whatever,\nhowever the heck ants. So I would try to mimic them in some way. So in that sense, it makes sense that the objects we would see,\nyou mentioned bipedal. Yes, of course it's ridiculous that aliens would actually be very similar to us, but maybe they create\nforms in order to be like, here, the humans will understand it. And this needs to be sufficiently\ndifferent from humans to know that there's something weird. I don't know., I think\nit's actually an incredibly difficult problem of figuring\nout how to communicate with a thing way dumber than you. And people assume, like if you're smart, it's easy to talk to the dumb thing. But I think it's actually\nextremely difficult when the gap in intelligence is just\norders of magnitude. And so of course you can observe, but once you notice the thing\nis sufficiently interesting, how do you communicate with that thing? - So this is where one of\nthe things I always try to highlight is how conspiracies are born. Because many people don't\nunderstand how easy it is to fall into the conspiratorial cycle. So the first step to a\nconspiracy being born is to have a piece of evidence that is true. And then immediately\nfollowing the true evidence is a gap in information. And then to fill in\nthe gap of information, people create an idea, and then the next logical\noutcome is based on the idea that they just created, which is an idea that's based on something that was imagined in the first place. So the idea, the factual\nthing is now two steps away, and then three steps away, four steps away as the things go on. And then all of a sudden you\nhave this kernel of truth that turned into this wild conspiracy. So in our example, you talked about humans trying\nto communicate with ants. Ants are not intelligent. Ants are not an intelligent species. They're drone species\nthat's somehow commanded through whatever technology, whatever... - Spoken like a typical human, but yes. - Whatever biological thing\nis in the queen, right? But it's not a fair equivalent. But let's look at gorillas\nor let's look at something in the monkey family, right? Where largely we agree that there is some sort of intelligence there, or dolphins, some sort of intelligence, right? It is A human thing to want to observe and then communicate and integrate. That's a human thing, not\nan intelligent life thing. So for us to even think that a foreign and intelligent alien species would want to engage in communicate at all, is an extremely human assumption. And then from that assumption, then we started going into\nall the other things you said. If they wanted to communicate,\nwouldn't they wanna mimic. If they wanted to mimic, wouldn't they create devices like ours? So now we're three steps\nremoved from the true fact of there's something\nunexplainable in the skies. - Yeah, so the fact is there's\nsomething unexplainable in the skies, and then\nwe're filling in the gaps with our basic human biases. But the thing is... - Now we're getting right\nback to project Northwood. We need some plan. I don't care how crazy the idea\nis, guys, give me some plan. So that's where we come up with, well, maybe it's an alien\nspecies trying to communicate or maybe it's an alien, a\nhostile threat that's trying to take over the world or\nwho knows what, maybe it's... - I mean, but you have to\nsomehow construct hypotheses and theories for anomalies. And then from that amidst giant pile of\nthe ridiculous emerges perhaps a deeper truth over period of decades. And at first that truth is ridiculed and then it's accepted. You know, that whole process. - The earth revolving around the sun. - Yeah, the earth\nrevolving around the sun. But you know, to me it's interesting because it's asks us\nlooking out there with SETI, just looking for alien life is forcing us to really ask questions about\nourselves, about what is life, how special, first of\nall, what is intelligence? How special is intelligence in the cosmos? And I think it's inspiring and challenging to us as human beings, both on a scientific\nand engineering level, but also on a philosophical level. I mean, all of those\nquestions that are laid before us when you start\nto think about alien life. - So you interviewed Joe Rogan recently. And he said something\nthat I thought was really, really brilliant during\nthe podcast interview. He said that you... - He's gonna love hearing that. (both laughing) - Well, go ahead, sorry. - But he said that he\nrealized at some point that the turn in his\nopinion about UFOs happened when he realized how desperately\nhe wanted it to be true. This is the human condition. Our pink matter works the same way as everybody's pink matter. And one of the ways that\nour pink matter works is with what's known as a cognitive bias. It's a mental shortcut. Essentially, your brain\ndoesn't want to process through facts over and over again. Instead, it wants to assume\ncertain facts are in place and just jump right to the conclusion. It saves energy, it saves megabytes. So what Joe Rogan, I feel weird calling him\nJoe, I don't know him. But what Joe identified on his own... - Mr. Rogan,\n- What Mr. Rogan identified on his own was his own cognitive loop. And then he immediately grew\nsuspicious of that loop. That is a super powerful tool. That is something that\nmost people never become self-actualized enough to realize that they have a cognitive loop, let alone questioning\ntheir own cognitive loop. So when it came to this\ntopic specifically, that was just something that\nI thought was really powerful because you learned to not\nnot trust your own mind. - Just for the record,\nafter he drinks one whiskey, all that goes out. I think that was just\nin that moment in time, like, you know... - [Andrew] A moment of brilliance. - A moment of brilliance. Because I think he still is... One of the things that\ninspires me about Joe is how open-minded he is, how curious he is. He refuses to let sort of the conformity and the conventions of any one community, including the scientific\ncommunity, be a kind of thing that limits his curiosity\nof asking what if, like the whole, it's entirely possible. I think that's a beautiful thing, and it actually represents\nwhat the best of science is, that childlike curiosity. So it's good to sort of\nbalance those two things, but then you have to wake up to it, like, is there a chance this is true or do I just really want it to be true? - Like the hot girl that\ntalks to you overseas. - Yeah, yeah.\n(Andrew laughing) For a brief moment.\n(Andrew laughing) There's a actually a\ndeeper explanation for it that I'll tell you off\nthe mic that perhaps a lot of people can kind\nof figure out anyway... - Just to take it one step further 'cause I love this stuff. Personally, I love pink matter stuff. In your interview with Jack Barsky, Jack's a good friend of mine. - A good dude.\n- [Lex] Incredible person. And your conversation with Jack Barsky, he started talking to you about how his recruiters were\nfeeding back to him his own beliefs, his own\nopinions about himself, how smart he was, how good he was, how uniquely qualified he was. That's all pink matter manipulation. Feeding right back to the person, what they already think of themselves is a way to get them to\ninvest and trust you faster, because obviously you value\nthem for all the right reasons, because that's how they see themselves. So that loop that the\nKGB was using with Jack, Jack did not wake up to\nthat loop at the time. He woke up to it later. So\nit happens to all of us. We're all in a loop. It's just, whether it's about oat milk or whether it's about aliens or whether it's about, you\nknow, the Democrats trying to take your guns, whatever\nit is, everybody's in a loop. And we've gotta wake up to ask ourselves, just like you said, is it true or do we just really want it to be true? And until you ask yourself that question, you're just one of the\nmasses trapped in the loop. - That's the Nietzsche\ngaze into the abyss. It's a dangerous thing, hat's the past insanity\nis to ask that question. You wanna be doing it carefully, but it's also the place\nwhere you can truly discover something fundamental about this world that people don't understand and lay the groundwork\nfor progress, scientific, cultural, all that kind of stuff. \"What is one spy trick?\" This is from a Reddit that I really enjoy. What's one spy trick? And you're full of a million spy tricks. People should follow you.\nYou did an amazing podcast. You're just an amazing person. What is the one spy trick\nyou would teach everyone that they can use to improve\ntheir life instantly? Now, you already mentioned quite a few, but what else could jump to mind? - My go-to answer for\nthis is not really changed much over the last few years. So the first, the most important spy trick to change everything\nimmediately is something called perception versus perspective. We all look at the world\nthrough our own perception. My dad used to tell me,\nmy stepdad used to tell me that perception is reality. And I was arguing this with him when I was 14 years old, \"I told you so, dad, you're still wrong.\" But perception is your interpretation of the world around you. But it's unique only to you. There's no advantage in your perception. That's why so many people\nfind themselves arguing all the time trying to\nconvince other people of their own perception. The way that you win any argument, the way that you get ahead in your career, the way that you outsell\nor out race anybody, is when you move off of perception and move into perspective. Perspective is the act or the art of observing the\nworld from outside of yourself. Whether that's outside of yourself as like an entity just observing from a different point of view. Or even more powerful,\nyou sit in the shoes, you sit in the seat of\nthe person opposite you, and you think to yourself,\nwhat is their life like? What do they feel right now?\nYou know, are they comfortable? Are they uncomfortable? Are they afraid? Are they scared? What's the stressor that\nthey woke up to this morning? What's the stressor that they're gonna go to sleep with tonight? When you shift places and get\nout of your own perception and into someone else's perspective, now you're thinking like them, which is giving you an\ninformational advantage, but you know what they're all doing? Everyone else out there is\ntrapped in their own perception. Not thinking about a\ndifferent perspective. So immediately you have\nsuperior information, superior positioning,\nyou have an advantage that they don't have. And if you do that to your boss, if's gonna change your career. If you do that to your spouse, it's gonna change your marriage. If you do that to your kids, it's gonna change your family legacy because nobody else out there is doing it. - It's so interesting\nhow difficult empathy is for people and how powerful it is. Especially for like you said, the spouse, like intimacy. Like stepping outside of yourself and really putting yourself in the shoes of the other person, considering\nhow they see the world. I really enjoy that because how does that\nexactly lead to connection? I think when you start to understand the way the\nother person sees the world, you start to enjoy the\nworld through their eyes. And you start to be able to\nshare, in terms of intimacy, share the beauty they see together because you understand their perspective. And somehow you converge as well. Of course that allows you to gather information better\nand all that kind of stuff. And like that allows you\nto work together better, to share in all different kinds of ways. But for intimacy, that's\na really powerful thing. And also for actually, like\npeople you really disagree with or people on the internet\nyou disagree with and so on. I find empathy is such a powerful way to resolve any tensions there. Even like people like trolls or all that kind of stuff,\nI don't deride them. I just kind of put myself in their shoes and it becomes like an enjoyable comradery with that person. - So I wanna draw a pretty hard line between perspective and empathy. Because empathy is\nfrankly an overused term by people who don't really know what they're saying sometimes. I think you know what you're saying, but the vast majority\nof people listening... - I would argue that, but that's fine. - As soon as you say empathy,\nthey're gonna just be like, oh yeah, I know I've heard\nthis a thousand times. Empathy is about feeling\nwhat other people feel or understanding...\n- It's more about feeling would you say? - It's about feelings. It's about understanding\nsomeone else's feelings. Feeling, it's not the same as sympathy where you feel their feelings. Empathy is about recognizing\nthat they have feelings and recognizing that\ntheir feelings are valid. Perspective is more than just feelings. It's about the brain, it's\nabout the pink matter, on the left side and the\nright side of the brain. Yes, I care about feelings. And this goes directly to\nyour point about connection. Yes, I care about feelings, but I also care about objectives. What is your aspirational goal? What was it like to grow up\nas you, yeah, what was it like to experience this and how did this shape\nyour opinion on that? And you know, what is it\nthat you're going to do next? More than just feelings,\nactual tactical actions. And that becomes extremely\nvaluable in the operational world because if you can get\ninto someone's head, left brain and right\nbrain, feelings and logic, you can start anticipating what actions they're gonna take next. You can direct the actions\nthat they're going to take next because you're basically telling them the story that's in their own head. When it comes to relationships and personal connection,\nwe talked about it earlier, the thing that people want\nthe most is community. They want someone else\nwho understands them. They want to be with people.\nThey don't want to be alone. The more you practice perspective,\nempathy or no empathy, the more you just validate\nthat a person is there. I am in this time and space\nwith you in this moment. Feelings aside, right, that is powerful. That is intimate. And whether you're talking about lovers or whether you're talking\nabout a business exchange or whether you're talking\nabout collaborators in a crime, I'm here\nwith you, ride or die, let's do it. Right? That's powerful. - How much of what you've\nlearned in your role at the CIA transfer over to relationships,\nto business relationship, to other aspects of life? This is something you work closely with powerful people to help them out. What have you learned\nabout the commonalities, about the problems that people face? - Man, I would say about a solid 95% of what I learned at CIA carries\nover to the civilian world, that 5% that doesn't, it would carry over in a disaster, right? Knowing how to shoot on target with my non-dominant hand\nreally only has one purpose. It's not gonna happen day-to-day, right? Knowing how to do a dead\ndrop that isn't discoverable by the local police force isn't\ngonna be useful right now, but it could be useful in a disaster. But the 95% of stuff that's useful, it's all tied to the human condition. It's all tied to being able to understand what someone's thinking, understand what someone's\nfeeling, direct their thoughts, direct their emotions,\ndirect their thought process, win their attention, win their loyalty, win influence with\nthem, grow your network, grow your own circle of influence. I mean, all of that is\nimmensely, immensely valuable. As an example, the disguise\nthing that we talked about earlier, disguise in and\nof itself has mixed utility. If you're Brad Pitt and\nyou don't want anybody to know your Brad Pitt, you\nput on a level one disguise and that's great. Or maybe you call me and I walk you through a level two disguise\nso that you can go to Aruba and nobody's gonna know\nyou're in Aruba, right? Whatever it is. But even there with the\n5% that doesn't apply to everyday life, there's\nstill elements that do. For example, when a person\nlooks at a human being's face, the first place they look\nis the same part of the face as if they were reading a piece of paper. So in English, we start from the top left and we read left to right, top to bottom. So when an English\nspeaking person interacts with another person, the\nfirst thing they look at isn't their eyes, it's the upper left,\nfrom their point of view, corner of their face. They look there and the\ninformation they get is hair color, hair pattern, skin color, right? That's it, before they know\nanything else about the face. This is one of the reasons\nwhy somebody can look at you and then you ask them,\n\"What color are my eyes?\" I don't really remember. Because the way they read the face, they read it from left\nto right, top to bottom. So they're paying a lot of attention to the first few things they see, and then they're paying less attention as they go down the face. The same scrolling behavior\nthat you see on the internet. So when you understand that\nthrough the lens of disguise, it allows you to make a\nvery powerful disguise. The most important part\nof your disguise is here, if you're English speaking. Right here, if you're speaking\nsome foreign languages that read right to left, right? If it's Chinese, you know that they're gonna look from here down 'cause they read left down. - So it's so interesting. So yeah, knowing that really\nhelps you sort of configure the things in terms of\nphysical appearance. That's interesting.\n- Correct. Correct. So when it comes to\nhow to make a disguise, not so useful to the\nultra wealthy usually. But when it comes to how to read a face or more importantly how people\nare going to read your face, that's extremely important because now you know\nwhere to find the first signs of deception in a\nbaseline or anything else. - You mentioned that the\nidea of having privacy is one that we think we\ncan, but we really don't. Is it possible for maybe somebody like me or a regular person to\ndisappear from the grid? - Absolutely and it's not\nas hard as you might think. It's not convenient. Again, convenience and security. You can disappear tomorrow, right? I can walk you through\nthree steps right now that's gonna help you disappear tomorrow. But none of them are convenient. They're all extremely secure, right? The first thing you do is every piece of digital technology you\nhave that is connected to you in any way, is now dead. You just let the battery run out. - [Lex] forever.\n- Forever. You never touch it again.\nStarting at this moment. What you have to do is go\nout and acquire a new one. Realistically, you will not be able to acquire a new one in the\nUnited States by buying it because to do so, you would\ntie it to your credit card, you would tie it to a\nlocation, a time, a place, a registered name, whatever else. So you would have to acquire\nit essentially by theft or through the black market. So you would want something because you're gonna need\nthe advantage of technology without it being in your name. So you go out and you steal a phone or you steal a laptop, you\ndo whatever you have to do to make sure that you can\nget on with the password and whatever else that might be, As dirty or as clean\nas you want that to be, we're all morally flexible here. But now you have a technological device that you can work with,\nand then from there on, you're just doing whatever you have to do. Whether you're stealing\nevery step of the way or whether you run a massive con. Keep in mind that we often\ntalk about conmen and cons. Do you know the word that con\nis a root word for confidence. That's what a conman is. A conman is a confidence man. Just somebody who is so brazenly\nconfident that the people around them living in\ntheir own perception, not perspective and their perception, they're like, \"Well, this guy really knows what he's talking about, so\nI'm gonna do what he says.\" So you can run a massive con and that can take care of your\nfinances, that can take care of your lodging, whatever\namount, whatever else it is. You are whoever you\npresent yourself to be. So if you wanna be Bill for the afternoon, just go tell people your name is Bill. They're not gonna question you. - So the intelligence, the natural web of\nintelligence gathering systems we have in the United\nStates and in the world, are they going to believe\nfor long that your Bill? - Until you do something that\nmakes them think otherwise. If you are consistent, we talked about consistency\nbeing the superpower. If you are consistent, they\nwill think your Bill forever. - How difficult is that to do? - It's not convenient. It's quite difficult. - Does that like require training? - It does require training. - Because why do criminals\nalways get caught? - Because they stop being consistent. I never hesitate to admit this, but people tell me I should\nhesitate to admit it. So now I hesitate because of the guidance I've gotten to hesitate, right? I like criminals. I'm friends with a number of criminals because the only people\nwho get me like right away who get me, are criminals because we know what it's like to basically abandon all\nthe rules, do our own thing our own way, and watch the\nworld just keep turning. Most people are so stuck in the trap of normal thought and behavior that when I tell them, they just don't just go tell\npeople your name is Bill. Most people are gonna say,\n\"Psh, that's not gonna work.\" But a criminal will be like,\n\"Oh yeah, I did that once. I just told everybody my name is Nancy. I'm a dude and they still believe me.\" Criminals just get it, right? So what happens with criminals is they go to the school of hard knocks. They learn criminal behavior on the job. Spies go to school, we go to the best spy school in the world. We go to Langley's, the farm, right? What's known as Field\nTradecraft Course, FTC, in a covert location for\na covert period of time. And covert, covert, covert. So if anybody from CIA is watching, I'm not breaking any rules, it's all in Wikipedia, but\nit's not coming from me. But that's how we do it. They train us from a\nhundred years of experience in the best ways to carry\nout covert operations, which are all just criminal\nactivities overseas. We learn how to do it the right way so that we don't get caught. We learn how to be consistent. More importantly, we learn\nhow to create an operation that has a limited lifespan because the longer it lives,\nthe more at risk you are. So you want operations to be short, concise on the X, off the X,\nlimit your room for mistakes. Criminals, they default to wanting these long-term operations 'cause they don't wanna\nhave to recreate a new way to make money every 15 days. - You mentioned if anybody\nfrom the CIA is watching, so I've seen you talk about\nthe fact that sort of people that are currently working\nat the CIA would kind of look down at the people\nwho've left the CIA and they deride them. Especially if you go public, especially if there's a book\nand all that kind of stuff. Do you feel the pressure\nof that to be quiet, to not do something like this conversation that we're doing today? - I feel the silent\njudgment. That's very real. I feel it for myself and\nI feel it for my wife who doesn't appear on camera very often, but who's also former CIA,\nwe both feel the judgment. We know that right now, three\ndays after this is released, somebody's gonna send an email\non a closed network system inside CIA headquarters, and there's a bunch of people\nwho are gonna laugh at it. A bunch of people who are gonna say that, who knows what, it's\nnot gonna be good stuff. - A bunch of people you respect probably. - A bunch of people who I'm\ntrying to bring honor to, whether I know them or\nrespect them is irrelevant. These are people who are out\nthere doing the deed every day, and I wanna bring them honor, and I wanna do that in a\nway that I get to share what they can't share and what they won't share when they leave, because they will also\nfeel the silent pressure, the pressure, the shame,\nthe judgment, right? But the truth is that I've\ndone this now long enough. The first few times that\nI spoke out publicly, the response to being a positive voice for what the sacrifices\nthat people are making, it's so refreshing to be an honest voice that people don't normally hear that it's too important. One day I'm gonna be gone and my kids are gonna\nlook back on all this and they're gonna see their dad trying to do the right thing\nfor the right reasons. And even if my son or\ndaughter ends up at CIA and even if they get ridiculed for being, \"Oh, you're the Bustamante kid, right? Your dad's a total sellout.\" Whatever it might be. Like, I want them to know,\nyou know, dad was doing what he could to bring\nhonor to the organization even when he couldn't stay\nin the organization anymore. - So you said when you were 27, I think, you didn't know what\nthe hell you're doing. So now that you're a few\nyears older and wiser, let me ask you to put\non your wise sage hat and give advice to other 27 year olds or even younger, 17, 18 year olds that are just outta high\nschool, maybe going to college, trying to figure out this life, this career thing that they're on. What advice would you give\nthem about how to have a career or how to have a life\nthey can be proud of? - That's a powerful question, man. - [Lex] Have you figured\nit out yet yourself? - No, I'm a grand total\nof seven days smarter than I was at 27. Not a good average. - [Lex] Progress.\n(both laughing) - There's still time.\n- There's still time. So for all the young people\nout there deciding what to do, I would just say the same thing that I do say, and I\nwill say to my own kids, you only have one life. You only have one chance. If you spend it doing what\nother people expect you to do, you will wake up to your\nregret at some point. I woke up when I was 38 years old. My wife, in many ways\nis still waking up to it as she watches her grandparents pass and an older generation pass away. The folks that really have a blessed life are the people who learn early on to live with their own rules, live their own way, and live every day as\nif it's the last day. Not necessarily to waste it\nby being wasteful or silly, but to recognize that today\nis a day to be productive and constructive for yourself. If you don't want a\ncareer, today's not the day to start pursuing a career just because someone else told you to do it. If you wanna learn a language,\ntoday's the day to find a way to buy a ticket to another country and learn through immersion. If you want a date, if\nyou wanna get married, if you want a business, today\nis the day to just go out and take one step in that direction. And as long as every day,\nyou just make one new step, just like CIA recruited\nme, just do the next thing. If the step seems like it's too big, then there's probably two other steps that you can do before that. Just make constant\nprogress, build momentum, move forward and live on your own terms. That way you don't ever\nwake up to the regret. - And it'll be over before you know it. - Whether you regret it or not, it's true. - What do you think is the\nmeaning of this whole thing? What's the meaning of life? - Self-respect. That's a fast answer. There's a story behind\nit, if you want the story. - I would love to have the story. - There's a covert training\nbase in Alabama in the south and far south in like\nthe Armpit of America, where elite tier one operators go to learn human intelligence stuff. And there's a bar inside this base. And on the wall it's scribbles of opinions. And the question in the\nmiddle of the wall says, \"What's the meaning of life?\" And all these elite operators\nover the last 25 or 30 years, they all go, they get drunk\nand they scribble their answer and they circle it with a Sharpie, right? Love, family, America\nFreedom, right, whatever. And then the only thing they have to do is if they're gonna\nwrite something on there, they have to connect it with\nsomething else on the wall, at least one other thing. So if they write love, they can't just leave it floating there. They have to write love in a little bubble and connect it to something else, connect it to family, whatever else. When you look at that wall, the word self-respect is on the wall and it's got a circle around it, and then you can't see any other word because of all the things\nthat connect to self-respect. Just dozens of people have written over, have written their words\ndown and been drawn and scribbled over\nbecause of all the lines that connect self-respect. So what's the meaning of life? From my point of view, I've\nnever seen a better answer. It's all self-respect. If you don't respect yourself, how can you do anything else? How can you love someone else if you don't have self-respect? How can you build a\nbusiness you're proud of if you don't have self-respect? How can you raise kids? How\ncan you make a difference? How can you pioneer anything? How can you just wake up and have a good day if you\ndon't have self-respect? - The power of the individual. That's what makes this country great. I have to say, after traveling\nquite a bit in Europe and especially in a\nplace of war, coming back to the United States\nmakes me really appreciate about the better angels of this nation, the ideals it stands for,\nthe values it stands for. And I'd like, like to thank\nyou for serving this nation for time and humanity for time, and for being brave enough and bold enough to still talk about it and to inspire others, to educate others, for having many amazing conversations and for honoring me by having\nthis conversation today. You're an amazing human. Thanks so much for talking today. - Lex, I appreciate the\ninvite, man, and it was a joy. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Andrew Bustamante.

And now let me leave you some words from Sun Tzu in the \"Art of War.\" \"Let your plans be dark\nand impenetrable as night and when you move, fall\nlike a thunderbolt.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
