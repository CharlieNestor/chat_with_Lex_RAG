      "text": "- I would run outside and just lay on the ground\nunder the southern Milky Way; beautiful, right, up there. And I would just lay\nthere like the snow angel and just kind of let my thoughts sort of pass through my brain. And this is when I\npersonally have the feeling that I'm apart of it, I belong here, rather than feeling kind of small. Yes, I'm small, but there are many other small things. And lots of small things\nmake one big whole. - The following is a\nconversation with Anna Frebel, an astrophysicist at MIT studying the oldest stars\nin the Milky Way galaxy in order to understand the chemical and physical conditions\nof the early universe and how from that our\ngalaxy formed and evolved to what it is today, the place we humans call home. This is the \"Lex Fridman\nPodcast\"; to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Anna Frebel. Let's go back to the early days. What did the formation of the\nMilky Way galaxy look like? Or maybe we wanna start even before that. What did the formation of\nthe universe look like? - Well, we, scientists,\nbelieve there was the Big Bang, some big beginning. (chuckles) But what is important for my work, and I think that's what\nwe're going to talk about, is what kind of elements\nwere present at that time. So the Big Bang left a universe behind that was made of just hydrogen helium and tiny little sprinkles of lithium, and that was pretty much it. And, as it turns out, it's actually quite hard to make stars or any structure from\nthat, that very hot gas. And so the very first stars that formed prior to any galaxies were\nvery massive stars, big stars, 100 times the mass of the sun, and they were made from\njust hydrogen and helium. So big stars explode pretty fast, after a few million years only. That's very short on cosmic time scales. And in their explosions, they provided the first heavier\nelements to the universe because, in their course, all stars fuse lighter elements like hydrogen and helium\ninto heavier ones, and then that goes all the way up to iron. And then all that material gets ejected in these massive supernova explosions. And that marked a really, really important\ntransition in the universe. Because after that first explosion, it was no longer chemically pristine. And that set the stage for\neverything else to happen, including us here talking today. (laughs) - So what do you mean by pristine? So there's a whole complex soup of elements now as opposed to just hydrogen helium and a little bit of lithium. - Yeah, so after the Big Bang,\njust hydrogen and helium. We don't really need to\ntalk too much about lithium because the amount was so small. And after these very first\nstars formed and exploded, the heavier elements like\ncarbon, oxygen, magnesium, iron, all of that stuff was suddenly\npresent in the gas clouds in tiny amounts only,\nonly very tiny amounts. But that actually helped, especially the carbon and the oxygen, to make the gas cool. These atoms are more\ncomplicated than hydrogen, that's just a proton, and so it has cooling properties, can send out photons\noutside of the gas cloud so the gas can cool. And when you have gas that\ngets colder and colder, you can make small and smaller stars, so you can fragment it and clump it and turn it into stars like the sun. And the cool thing about that is that when you have\nsmall stars like the sun, they have a really long lifetime. So those first low-mass\nstars that formed back then are still observable today. That is actually what I do. I try to find these early survivors because they tell us what the\ngas looked like back then. They have preserved that composition of these early gas cloud, the,\nthe chemical compositions, until today. So I don't need to look\nvery far into the universe to study all the beginnings, I can just chemically\nanalyze the oldest stars. And it's like unpacking everything\nthat happened back then. It's very exciting. - So to just reiterate. So in the very early days, in\nthe first few million years, there was giant stars that's\nmostly hydrogen and helium. And then they exploded in\nthese supernova explosions and then they made these clumps- - [Anna] Yeah, so the first stars- - Not pristine. Not pristine clumps? - Yeah, pretty much.\n- Fun. - So it took a few hundred million years for the first stars to emerge and then they exploded\nafter a few million years. Kaboom. And then it's like I always\nconsider the universe like a, you know, a nice soup. And then these first supernova explosions kind of provided the salt, you know, just a little sprinkle\nof heavier elements, and that made it really tasty. (chuckles) It just changed it completely, right? And that changed the physics of the gas. So that meant that these gas\nclouds that were, you know, surrounding the former first stars, they could now cool down and clump and form the next generation of stars that now included also little stars. And, as I just mentioned, the small stars have these\nreally long lifetimes. The sun has a lifetime\nof 10 billion years. Any star that is even less massive will have an even longer lifetime. So that gives us a chance to\nstill observe some of the stars that formed back then. So we are testing the conditions, the chemical and physical conditions, of the early universe even\nbefore the galaxy formed. - So what's the timeline\nthat we're talking about? What is the age of the universe? And what is the earliest\ntime we got those salty, delicious soup, clump soups\nwith heavier elements? - Well, the universe is\n13.8 billion years old. - Allegedly, yeah. Is it? So-\n- Yes. - Okay, 13.8-\n- Well, you know, when I was in high school, the universe was 20 billion years old. - [Lex] Oh, yeah? So the estimate-\n- Things have changed. - Do you think that estimate will evolve in interesting ways or no? Is it pretty stable at this point?\n- I think we have have mostly converged, yes, because the techniques\nare very different now, much more precise. The whole business of precision cosmology by mapping out the cosmic\nmicrowave background, you know, that's a marvelous feat. Maybe, you know, the digits will still\nmove around a little bit, but that's all right. - Plus the gravitational\nwaves and all that, so all the different sources of data kind of mapping out this detailed picture of the early universe. Yeah.\n- Totally. And so we think the earliest\nlittle stars formed, I don't know, maybe 1/2 billion years\nafter the Big Bang, right? Again, a few hundred million years for the first stars to emerge and then, you know, took some time, so give or take 1/2 billion years. And that was the time when sort of the very\nfirst protogalaxies formed, early stellar structures, stellar systems, from which the Milky Way\neventually formed, right? So it was... The Milky Way was probably\na slightly bigger one. And we know today that\ngalaxies grow hierarchically, which means the eat\ntheir smaller neighbors. So if you are the bigger one and have a few friends around, you're just gonna eat them, absorb them, and then you grow bigger. And so all these little\nearly stars, you know, kind of came into the Milky Way through that kind of process, and that's why we find them in the outer parts of the galaxy today, because they're just kind of (indistinct) and just left there since. - So the old stuff is on\nthe outskirts of the galaxy and the new stuff is closer to the middle? Is there-\n- Broadly speaking. - Okay.\n- Yes, yes. - So that's where you would look for it. So maybe just a step back. Like, what is a galaxy? What is a protogalaxy? - I love that question. So the galaxy is a huge assembly of stars. The Milky Way contains something like 200 to 400 billion stars. And most of the material and\nthe stars are in the disc. And when we look at the night sky, what we see as the Milky\nWay band on the sky, that is actually the inner, the next inner spiral arm, because we actually live\nin a spiral disc galaxy. The Milky Way is spiral disc galaxy. And we are looking... Actually it depends a little bit. In the Northern Hemisphere, we're looking out of the galaxy, so we are seeing the\nnext outer spiral arm. And as you can imagine, there's only dark space behind that. So we don't see it all\nthat nice on the sky. But if you travel to\nthe Southern Hemisphere, let's say South America, you see the Milky Way and it\nlooks so different on the sky because that's the next inner spiral arm, and that's back lit by\nthe galactic center. The galactic center is a\nvery big, puffy, you know, region of gas, there's\na lot of star formation. The galactic party is happening there, so it's very bright and it makes for this\nvery beautiful Milky Way on the night sky that we see. So actually if you ever get\nthe chance to experience that, I encourage you to almost\nlike close your eyes while seeing this and\nimagining that you are sitting in this kind of disc, in this pancake, and you're just kind of\nlooking right into it. And you can really feel\nthat we are in this 2D disc. And then you can imagine that\nthere's a top and a bottom and that we're really part of the galaxy. You can really experience that. We're not just lost in space somewhere, but we're really a part of it. And, you know, knowing a little bit about the structure of the Milky Way really helps. - Do you feel small when\nyou think about that, when you look on that spiral on the inside of the Milky Way and then you look out to the outside? Like, how are we supposed to feel? - I don't know. I don't feel small, necessarily. I feel in awe and I feel I'm a part of it because I can really feel\nthat I'm a part of it. I think for many people\nthey think like, oh, there's just the planet\nand then there's nothing, and that's almost a little bit sad. But that's really not the case, right, because there's so much more. And I really like to imagine, \"Wow, I'm sitting in this\nbig galactic merry-go-round and we're going around the center.\" And I can see the center above me, right? And I can almost feel like we're going, going there. (chuckles) Of course we can't really feel that, but the sun does circle\nthe galactic center. - But there's a kind of sadness to... Like looking at pictures\nof a nice vacation place, all we get is that light, an old light. Do you feel, like, sad\nthat we don't get to travel or you and I will not get to travel there and maybe humans will\nnever get to travel there? - Yeah, I always wanted\nto travel into space and see the Earth and\nother things from up there. There's certainly that. But I don't know. It's also okay to just\nbe at our vantage point and see it from here. - With the sensors, with\nthe telescopes that we have, and explore the possibility. I mean, there is a kind of\nwonder to the mystery of it all, what's out there, what interesting things that\nwe can't possibly imagine. You know, there could be all\nkinds of life forms, bacteria, all this kind of stuff. I tend to believe that... You know, it depends on the day. I tend to believe there's just a lot of\nvery primitive organisms just spread out throughout, and they build their little things, like bacteria-type organisms; and just to think what\nkind of worlds there are. 'Cause they're probably really\ncreative living organisms 'cause the conditions... I guess the question\nI'm wondering to myself when I look out there to the stars, how different are the conditions on the different planets\nthat orbit those stars? - It will definitely be very different. I mean, the variety out there is is huge. We know now that... I think it's about every other\nstar has at least one planet. I already mentioned the\nnumber of stars in the galaxy. I mean, you know, it's a huge\nnumber of planets out there. So who knows what that looks like? All we know is that there\nis a lot of variety. We don't quite yet\nunderstand what drives that, what governs that, why that is the case. Why is it not all one size fits all? - Oh, you mean the dynamics\nof planet formation, like exoplanet formation\nor star formation, the whole shebang?\n- All of it, all of it. Star formation remains\na much researched topic. We kind of, we definitely\nknow that it works because all the stars are\nthere, same for the planets, but the details are so\nvaried per gas cloud, right? It's very hard to come up with\nvery detailed prescriptions. Broadly, we have figured it out. You need a gas cloud, you need to cool it, something clumps and fragments and somehow it makes a star\nwith planets or without. - But the dynamics of the clumping process is not fully understood. - No, no. And the local conditions\nare so varied, right? I mean, it's the same with, you know, all people look like people, but individually we look very different. - So even the subtle diversity\nof the formation process creates all kinds of fun differences.\n- Yes. So we just don't know how this turned out in an individual case, and it's kind of hard\nto figure it all out. And to take a look, certainly\nwith planets, right, the chance to ever actually\ntake a picture of a planet is minuscule because they don't shine, so they're really dark. (laughs) So I'd say there's a lot\nof possibility out there, but we have to be a little\nbit more patient before we- - Or come up with technologies where patience becomes less necessary by extending our lifetimes or increasing the speed of space travel, all the kind of stuff. Humans are pretty, pretty intelligent, they're pretty-\n- Sometimes, yeah. - Sometimes sometimes. For the most part, I hope, on the optimistic days. Well, maybe just to linger\non the, what a galaxy is. What should we know about our\nunderstanding of black holes and their formation? Is that an important thing to understand in the formation of a galaxy? Like, so all the orbiting, all the spiraling that's going on, how important is that to understand? - All of the above. That's what makes astronomy really hard but also really interesting, right? No day is like another because\nwe always find something new. I wanna come back to the\nidea of the protogalaxy because that actually\nmatches or, you know, relates to the black hole formation. So most large, well, pretty much all large galaxies have a supermassive\nblack hole in the center. And we don't actually know, we don't really know where they come from. Again, we know that they're there, but how do we get there? So if we go back to the\nearly universe, right? We had a little galaxy that just sort of, you know, I don't know, had some small number of stars. It was the first\ngravitationally bound structure that was held together by dark matter, because dark matter actually\nkind of structured up, you know, first before\nthe luminous matter could because that's what dark\nmatter kind of does, and it started to hold gas and\nthen stars sort of together in these first very shallow, what we call potential wells, so these gravitationally bound systems. And then the mice grew from\nabsorbing neighboring, smaller, even smaller systems. And somewhere in that process there must have been a seed for one of these supermassive black holes. And I'm not actually sure\nthat it's clear right now kind of what was there first, the supermassive black hole or the galaxy. So lots of people are\ntrying to study that. And of course the black hole\nwasn't as massive back then as it is these days, but it's a big area of research. And the new James Webb,\nthe JWST, the telescope, the infrared telescope in\nspace, is working on... Many people are working on that to figure out exactly what happened. And there are some surprising results that we really don't\nunderstand right now, so... - So to solve the chicken\nor the egg problem of: Do you need the supermassive\nblack hole to form a galaxy or does the galaxy naturally create the\nsupermassive black hole? - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think to some\ndegree we can answer that because there are lots of\nlittle dwarf galaxies out there. You know, the Milky Way remains surrounded by many dozens of small dwarf galaxies; I have studied a bunch of them. And to the extent that we can tell, they do not contain black holes. So there certainly were\ngravitationally bound structures, so either you can call them protogalaxies or dwarf galaxies or first galaxies, they were definitely there. But there must have been bigger things, like the proto Milky Way, where something was different, right, what made them more\nmassive so that, you know, they would gravitationally\nattract these smaller systems to integrate them. So we'll have to see. - How do we look into that, into the dynamics of the formation, the evolution of the protogalaxies? Is it possible? Did they shine? I mean, what are the set of data that we can possibly look at? So we've got gravitational waves, which is really insane that\nwe can even detect those. There's light. What else can we- - So that would fall into the category of observational cosmology. And the JWST is the prime\ntelescope right now to... And it promises big steps forward. This is in its early days\nbecause it's only been online like a year or so. But that collects the infrared\nlight from the furthest, like literally protogalaxies, earliest galaxies that light has traveled some 13 billion years to us, and they're observing these\nfaint little blobs. (laughs) And folks are trying to, you\nknow, again, study the early, the onset of these early\nsupermassive black holes, how they shape galaxies. So they're seeing that\nthey were there, you know, surrounded by already bigger galaxies. Ideally I'd like for my colleagues to push a little bit further, hopefully that will\neventually happen. (laughs) - [Lex] In terms of looking towards the older and older ones? - Yeah. Yeah. And more and more sort of primitive in terms of the structure. But, of course, as you can imagine, if you make your system\nsmaller and smaller, it becomes dimmer and dimmer and it's further and further away. So we're reaching the end of the line from a technical\nperspective pretty quickly. - But it's dimmer and dimmer\nmeans older and older? - Yes, in a sense, because\nit all started really small. All right? - [Lex] Because it's smaller and smaller, which correlates to older and older. - In that phase of the universe, it would, otherwise it doesn't, yeah. - Just to take a small\ntangent about black holes, and, you know, because you do quite a bit\nof observational cosmology and maybe experimental astrophysics. What's the difference to you between theoretical\nphysics and experimental? So there's a lot of really\ninteresting explorations about paradoxes around black holes and all this kind of stuff, about black holes destroying information. Do those worlds intermix to you especially when you\nstep away from your work and kind of think about\nthe mystery of it all? - Well, at first glance there\nisn't actually much crosstalk. Personally, I mostly observe stars. So I don't usually actually think too much about black holes. - And stars is a fundamentally kinda chemical physical\nphenomena that doesn't- - That's right. The physics\nis kind of different. It's not extreme. - I mean, you know, you could consider a nuclear fusion sort of be perhaps extreme. You need to tunnel. There's some interesting physics there, but it's a different flavor. I don't do these kinds of\ncalculations myself either. I very much like to talk\nwith my theory colleagues about these things, though, because I find there's always\nan interesting intersection. And often it's just... I've written a number of papers with colleagues who do like\nsimulations about galaxies. And so they're not quite as\nfar removed as, let's say, the black hole, you know,\npen-and-paper folks. But even in those cases, we had the same interests\nin the same topics, but it was almost like we were speaking two different languages. And we weren't even that\nfar removed, you know, both astronomers and all. And it was really interesting\njust to take the time and really try to talk\nto each other. (chuckles) And it's amazing how hard that is. You know, even amongst scientists, we already have trouble\ntalking to each other. Imagine how hard it's to\ntalk to non-scientists and other people to try, you know, to... We are all interested in the same things as humans at the end of the day, right? But everyone has sort of\na different angle about it and different questions and\nway of formulating things. And sometimes it really\ntakes a while to converge and to get, you know,\nto the common ground. But if you take the time, it's so interesting to\nparticipate in that process. And it feels so good\nin the end to say like, \"Yes, we tackled this together,\" right? \"We overcame our differences, not so much in opinion but just in expressing\nourselves about this and how we go about solving a problem.\" And these were some of my\nmost successful papers, and I certainly enjoyed them the most. - And it could also\nlead to big discoveries. I mean, there's a... I think you put it really well in saying that we're all kind of studying the same kind of mysteries and problems. I mean, I see this in the space\nof artificial intelligence. You have a community, maybe\nit seems very far away, artificial intelligence and neuroscience. You know, you would think\nthat they're studying very different things. But one is trying to\nengineer intelligence, and in so doing trying to\nunderstand intelligence. And the other is trying\nto understand intelligence and cognition in the human mind. And they're just doing it\nfrom a different set of data, different set of backgrounds, and the researchers that\ndo that kind of work. And probably the same is true in observational cosmology and simulation. So it's like a fundamentally\ndifferent approach to understanding the universe. For simulation: \"Let me use the things I know to create a bunch of\nparameters and create some, just play with it, play\nwith the universe, play God, create a bunch of universes and see in a way that\nmatches experimental data.\" It's a fun, it's like playing\nSims but at the cosmic level. - [Anna] Yes, yes. (Laughs) - And then probably the set\nof terminology used there is very different. And maybe you're allowed\nto break the rules a little bit more. Let's have... You know, yeah... It's like the Drake equation. Yeah, you don't really know. You kind of come up with a\nbunch of values here and there and just see how it\nevolves and, from that, kind of intuit the\ndifferent possibilities, the dynamics of the evolution\nof a galaxy, for example. Yeah, but it's cool to\nplay between those two. 'Cause it seems like\nwe understand so little about of our cosmos, so it's good to play. - Yes, it's like a big sandbox, right? And everyone kind of\nhas their little corner and they do things, but we we're all in the\nsame sandbox together at the end of the day. - And that sandbox does\nhave super powerful and super expensive telescopes\nthat everybody's also, all the children are\nfighting for the resources to make sure they get to\nask the right questions using that big, cool tool. Well, can we actually\nstep back on the big field of stellar archeology? What is this process? Can you just speak to it again? You've been speaking to it, but what is this process of\narcheology in the cosmos? - Yeah, it's really fascinating. So I mentioned the lesser the mass of the star, the longer it lives. And, again, for reference\nfor the next dinner party, the sun's lifetime is 10 billion years. So if you have a star that's\n0.6 or 0.8 solar masses, then its lifetime is going\nto be 15 to 20 billion years. And that's an important\nrange for our conversation, Because, again, if you assume that such\na small star formed soon after the Big Bang, then it is still observable today. You mentioned old light before, yeah, that light is like a\nfew thousand years old, but compared to the age of\nthese stars it's nothing. So to me, that's young. (chuckles) It comes straight from\na galaxy or, you know, it's not far. These stars are not far away, they're in our galaxy in the outskirts. They probably did not form\nin the galaxy because, again, hierarchical assembly of our Milky Way meant-\n- They were eaten. - Exactly. They formed in a little\nother galaxy in the vicinity and at some point the Milky Way ate that, which means absorbed all the stars, including, you know, these little old stars that are now in the\noutskirts of the Milky Way that I use to point my telescope to. So what can we learn from these stars? Why should we study them? Now, these little stars are really, really efficient with\ntheir energy consumption. They're still burning, for the experts, just burning hydrogen to\nhelium in their cores, and they have done so for the\npast 12, 13 billion years, however old they are. And they're gonna keep doing that for another few billion years; same as the sun. The sun also just does\nhydrogen to helium burning and will continue that for a while. Which means the outer\nparts of the star, well, pretty much actually most of the star, that gas doesn't talk to the core. So whatever composition that\nthat star has, you know, in its outer layers is exactly the same as the gas composition\nfrom which the star formed, which means it has perfectly preserved that information from way back then all the way to today and going forward. So I'm a stellar archeologist because I don't dig in the dirt to find remnants of past\ncivilization and whatnot. I dig for the old stars in the sky because they have\npreserved that information from these first billion years in their outer stellar atmosphere, which is what I'm\nobserving with telescopes. So I'm getting the best look at the chemical composition early on that you could possibly wish for. - What kind of age are\nwe talking about here? Are talking about something\nthat's close to that, you know, like a 13 billion, 12, 13 billion age range?\n- Yeah. That's what we think. Now, there's a small caveat here. We cannot accurately date these stars, but we use a trick to say, \"Oh, these stars must have formed as some of the earliest\ngenerations of stars,\" because we need to talk\nabout the chemical evolution of the universe and the\nMilk Way for a second. So I already mentioned the pristine-ness of the universe\nafter the Big Bang, right, just hydrogen and helium. Then the first stars formed, they produced a sprinkle of\nheavier elements up to iron. Then the next generation of stars formed. That included, again, massive stars that they\nwould explode again, but also the little ones\nthat keep on living, right? And then the massive ones,\nagain, explode as supernova, so they provide, again, another sprinkle of heavier elements. And so over time, all the elements in the periodic\ntable have been built up. There have been other\nprocesses, for example, neutron star mergers and\nother exotic supernovae, that have provided\nelements heavier than iron, all the way up to uranium, from very early on. We're still trying to\nfigure out those details. But I always say pretty\nmuch all the elements were done from like day three. - So iron is where... Like, once you get to iron, you got all the fun you\nneed, most of the fun. - Yes and no. I really like the heavier\nelements, you know, gold, silver, platinum, that kind of stuff. (both laugh) - For personal reasons\nor for star formation? - [Anna] Well, both. (Lex and Anna laughing) - I mean, like, what's the importance\nof these heavier metals in the evolution of the stars? - So they're the spice of life, right? So every supernova gives\nyou elements up to iron. That's cool, but at some point it\ngets a little bit boring because that always works. But that's the baseline; we need that. And that's certainly what\ncame out of the first stars and then all the other supernova\nexplosions that, you know, followed with every generation. And it took about a thousand\ngenerations, give or take, until the sun was made. So the sun formed from a gas cloud that was enriched by\nroughly thousand generations of supernova explosions, and that's why the sun has\nthe chemical composition that it has, including, you know, and somehow the planets where\nwere made from that as well. - So the supernova explosions,\nthe many generations, are creating more and\nmore complex elements. - No, it just goes all the way up to iron. And then it just, it's a little bit more\nof all of these elements. - Just more?\n- Yeah. It's one sprinkle, then another, and it just kind of adds up, right? Now, the heavy elements\nform in very different ways. They're not fusion made. They are made typically through\nneutron-capture processes, but for that you need seed\nnuclei, ideally, you know, iron or carbon or something. So the supernova-made elements are very good seed nuclei\nfor other processes that then create heavy elements. And because they cannot be\nmade everywhere, when... You know, some of my\nstars have huge amounts of these heavy elements in them, and they tell us, in much more detail, something really interesting\nhappened somewhere. - Well, wait. I thought I thought the really\nold ones we would not have. So what does that mean if the old- - Ah, yes, important clarification. So the stars that we are\nobserving today, these old ones, they formed from the gas. And the question is:\nWhat enriched that gas? So it could have been just a first star dumping their elements into\nthat gas all the way up to iron. And we have found some stars that we think are second-generation stars, so they form from gas enriched\nby just one first star. That's super cool. Then we find other old stars that have a much more complicated\nheavy element signature, and that means, okay, they're probably formed in a gas cloud that had a few things going on such as maybe a first star, maybe another more normal supernova, and maybe some kind of special process, like a neutron star merger, that would make heavy elements. And so they created a\nlocal chemical signature from which the next\ngeneration star then informed, and that is what we're observing today. So all these old stars\nbasically carry the signature from all these progenitor events. And it's our job then to unravel, okay, which processes and which\nevents and how many, you know, may have occurred in the early universe that led to exactly that signature that we observe 13 billion years later? - Is it possible to figure out like the number of generations\nthat resulted in these stars? - Well, we can... We think we can sort of say, \"Okay, this was like second\ngeneration or third,\" because the amounts of heavy elements in the stars that we observe is so tiny. One normal supernova explosion is actually already basically too much, it would give us too much of it. And the thing you can\nnever take away things in the universe, you can only add, there's no cosmic vacuum cleaner going around sucking things away. The black holes are probably\nthe closest to that, but they would have taken the whole star. - [Lex] Yeah, they'd take the whole thing, not just a little bit-\n- They wouldn't take stuff out of the gas, you know? So we have maybe 10 stars or so now where we are saying they contained so little of these heavy elements that they must be second generation, because how else would you have made them? And, again, I wanna\nstress that the elements that we observe in these stars were not made by the stars\nthemselves that we observe, that's just a reflection of the gas cloud. So we don't actually... I had to say that 'cause I love stars. At the end of the day, we don't really care for the\nstars that we're observing, we care for the story\nthat they're telling us about the early universe. - Yeah, so the stars are\na kinda small mirror. into the early universe. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - And so what are you\ndetecting about those stars? Can you tell me about the\nprocess of archeology here? Like, what kind of data\ncan we possibly get to tell the story about these\nheavy elements on these stars? - Yeah, it depends really\non what star you find. There are many different\nchemical signatures. We actually pair up, these days, our element signatures with\nalso kinematic information, how the star moves about the galaxy, that actually gives us clues as to where the star might have come from. Because, again, all these\nold stars are in the galaxy, but they're not off the galaxy. That's a small but important distinction. So they all came from somewhere else. - So you can rewind back in time to kind of estimate where it came from. - Yeah. So we can't really say, \"Oh, it came from that\nand that dwarf galaxy.\" But interestingly enough... Just a few days ago I submitted a paper with three women undergrads, it was so good to work together, and we found a sample\nof stars that have very, very low abundances in\nstrontium and barium, so very heavy elements. And I had a hunch for a while that these stars would\nprobably be some of the oldest. Because, as I said, heavy elements give you extra information about special events. And, again, finding\nsomething that's really low means that must have happened either really early on or in a very special environment, right, because we can only ever add. So if you find something\nthat's incredibly low in terms of the abundance, maybe just one event\ncontributed that, max. So we looked at the kinematics: How are these stars moving? And they're all going the\nwrong way in the galaxy. How is that possible? Well, it is possible because consider... Well, now we come back to the protogalaxy. The protogalaxy was like a beehive. It just didn't really know what it was or what it wanted to\nbecome when it grew up and it was absorbing all these\nlittle galaxies to grow fast. Some galaxies, some absorbed galaxies were\nthrown in going the main way and some came in the wrong way, huh? Happens.\n- It happens. - But this could only happen\nearly on when, you know, there wasn't left and\nright and up and down, so stuff would come in from always. So now, 13 billion years later, we're looking-\n- They're still doing it. - Yeah, A they're still doing it. And, B, we just looked for stars that have low strontium\nand barium abundances and then we look at the\nkinematics, and, lo and behold, they're all at hundreds\nof kilometers per second going the wrong way. It's like, \"Dude, you must\nhave come in really early on from somewhere else.\" So we call this retrograde motion. That's a clear sign of accretion, so something that has\ncome into the galaxy. And because they're so fast\nand it's really all of them, that must have happened early on, right? You can't throw a galaxy\ninto the Milky Way right now the wrong way, it eventually will turn around. - Can you actually,\njust on a small tangent, speak to the three women undergrads, like this little... It's pretty cool that you\nwere able to use a hunch to find this really cool little star. Yeah, what's the process like, especially with undergrads? I think that would be very interesting and inspiring to people. - Yes, it was a wonderful\nlittle collaboration that actually emerged in the fall. So I really like working with\nundergrads and, you know, grad students, postdocs. And I came up with a new\nconcept for a class at MIT where I wanted to integrate\nthe research process into the classroom because sometimes people\nfind it really hard to cold email a professor, \"Hey,\" you know, \"I'm this and that person, and I'm interested in your research. Could I possibly, you know, come?\" And I wanted to streamline that and give, and, you know, just trial how it would work to provide sort of the safe\nconfines of a classroom where you just sign up and do research in a very structured way. And I developed, it was a lot of work, a little bit more than I thought, to map up an entire research project basically from scratch in 10 worksheets so that they could do it, again, in a very structured\nand organized fashion. - Oh, so you created this whole framework for them to do it?\n- Yeah, the whole thing. But the promise was, \"You come sign up for my\nclass in teams of two. You each get your own old star that has not been analyzed before. I don't know what the solution is.\" Because in research we\ndon't look up the solution at the end of the book, we do not know what we're going to find, our job is to do the work and then to interpret the numbers because our job as scientists\nis to find the story. Anyone can crunch numbers, anyone. It's complicated sometimes, but it's doable, right?\n- Yes. - But coming up with a story when you only have three puzzle pieces, what does the puzzle look like? You have to be a little bit bold, you need to have some experience, and you need to kinda\nsee the universe in 3D. You just need to kinda go for it. And that's the beautiful thing. I really love that. - And so this was a\nstory of weird kinematics going the wrong way combined with this\nparticular weird signature in terms of the heavy elements. - [Ann] Yeah, exactly. - And you have to come up\nwith a story of all that. - Yes, and so the story\nof that paper is now... Usually I don't say I\nfind the oldest stars. You know, when I talk to\nmy research colleagues, I talk to them about we find the chemically\nmost pristine stars because that's actually what we measure, the chemical abundance\nthat tells us, okay, it must have been second or third or fifth generation of stars, right? But these low strontium stars\nthat go in the wrong way like they're getting paid for it, they must be the oldest stars\nthat came into the galaxy because they formed before the galaxy was\nthe Milky Way, right? And it's so cool and it was so wonderful. So this class, it went\nso well in the fall. I had nine people sign up. That's not unusual for a\nspecialty class at MIT, so a small number. It was eight women. And they were so into it that I said, \"Okay, let's use this opportunity. You're gonna do some extra work with me and we're gonna publish this.\" - Try to publish.\n- Yes. I also like that you're\nusing the terminology of chemically more pristine. When I'm talking to younger people, I'll just say that I'm more\nchemically pristine than them. I like that description of age. So there's this term of metal-poor stars. So most of these old stars\nare going to be metal poor? - [Lex] Yes, I search for\nthe most metal-poor stars. - And what does that... Can we just define what does that mean?\n- Yeah, what does that mean? I don't know who came up with this; I would love to know. But the universe is a complicated place. So many decades ago-\n- That's a good start. - someone clever came\nup with the idea to say, \"Let's simplify things a little bit. Let's call hydrogen X, helium Y, and all the other elements\ncombined metals, Z.\" (Lex and Anna laugh) When I give public talks, I always ask, \"Is there a chemist in the audience?. Let me just tell you, neon is a wonderful metal.\" And they're like, \"Oh, my\ngod, what is she's saying?\" But I'm an astronomer, I'm not a chemist, so I'll get away with it. So if you just roll with it for a moment, all the elements except\nhydrogen and helium are called metals. Now, if we look again at chemical or the concept of chemical evolution, it means more and more\noff all the elements, everything heavier than\nhydrogen and helium, gets produced slowly but surely by different types of source and events. So that's, you know, a\nmonotonously increasing function. And so we look for the stars that have the least amounts\nof heavy elements in them because that means we are going further and further back in\nthis process, in that function, almost all the way to the very beginning. And that is the first stars, right? They started that process. That's why I said it was such\nan important transition phase because things were... We call, you know, the post-Big Bang universe pristine, just hydrogen and helium, and after that the mess started. As soon as you add elements to it, things kinda get a little out of hand. That ends in this beautiful variety that we have everywhere these days. - Yeah, and you're looking\nat the very early days in the introduction of the variety. - Yes, exactly, when it was still a little bit\nmore organizable. (chuckles) But he variety of different types of metal-poor stars we have is stark. Many different types of stars, many patterns we have sort of identified, but there are still crazy ones out there that we're still trying to kind of fit in. - So what kind of stars\nhave been discovered? So you've already, a while ago, helped discover the star HE 1327-2326. Great name.\n- Yes. - And HE 1523-0901. What can you say about these stars and others that have been found? - I love them. They're my baby stars. - What do you call your baby stars? Is there cute names?\n- Well, I'm probably the only one who can, you know, spit out these names without cheating. - [Lex] Are there nicknames?\n- Well, no, that's their names.\n- That's not allowed? Okay.\n- Well, some colleagues at conferences have just called them\nAnna star or Frebel star because they didn't wanna learn\nthe phone number, you know, I get it.\n- The phone number. Yeah. - These numbers are actually based on older sets of\ncoordinates for these stars. So, yes, the minus in the middle means that they're in\nthe Southern Hemisphere. So negative is in the Southern Hemisphere, positive is in the Northern. And then 13 and 15 means\nthey're sort of observable in the middle of the year. - Okay, so it's the do\nwith the observation and where it was observed and that kinda stuff.\n- Yes, yes. But they are very different stars. Both absolutely significant, career defining, actually, for me, but really pushed the envelope\nin very different ways. So HE 1327, the first\none that you mentioned, that was the second\nsecond-generation star that we found. And, you know, usually people say like, \"Oh, the first one is a\nbig one and the rest is... Nobody cares.\" But to us it proved\nthat, yes, we can do it. Because, one, astronomers\nlive in this sort of way of... You know, there are a lot of\nserendipitous discoveries, and that's really great, but we need to show\nthat we can do it again. - [Lex] Mm-hmm, reliably. - Because then we're onto something and it's not just some\nkind of weird quirk. And there are a lot of\nquirks in the universe, but we wanna know: Is is that a real thing? Does that happen regularly? Is there something that we can learn? Is that a piece of the story? And so finding the second one that was even a little bit\nmore extreme than the first one really showed, yes, our\nsearch techniques work, we can find these stars. They provide an important\npart to the story in the sense that if we\nhad more than two stars, and by now we have about 10-ish or so, what do they tell us about the nature of the very first stars? And what we found, again,\nworking with the theorists, of course, who run these\nsupernova models, is that... So actually let me... Before I get into this, these two stars had huge amounts\nof carbon relative to iron. So we usually use iron\nas a reference element for what we call the metallicity, so the overall metal content, the overall amount of\nheavy elements in it. - So that's why it's called\nan iron-deficient star? - That's right. So these stars are\nincredibly iron deficient, which means there must be\nof the second generation, because there was... And interestingly enough,\nthere was this discrepancy. A normal supernovae, until then, we thought would get us\nso much iron, you know, and you would distribute\nthat in the gas cloud and then you would form this little star that we're observing. But the iron abundance that we measured was actually much lower than that. And I already mentioned,\nyou can't take things away. That must mean these\nearly massive Pop III, we call them Population\nIII, the first stars, they must have exploded in a different way than we previously thought. They can't output as much iron because they just can't, (laughs) otherwise it wouldn't\nmatch our observations. - [Lex] Got it. - And so that's when we started to work with several theory groups on supernova yields, so what comes out of- - From explosion of the supernova? - Yes.\n- That's cool, supernova yields. And so this one was\nnot yielding much iron. - Well, we needed to concoct\na theoretical supernova that made less. (chuckles) And it's actually surprisingly difficult. Because you can always add\nmore in the universe, right, but you can't take stuff away. So our Japanese colleagues\nkind of came up with the idea of a fainter supernova that\njust doesn't have a much, has enough oomph, you\nknow, when it explodes, so somehow there's less iron coming out. But at the same time, then these stars showed huge\nover abundances of carbon, you know, 1,000 times more carbon. So how do you now get\n1,000 times more carbon out of these poor first supernovae, right? That was the theoretical challenge. And because we didn't have\njust one star, but two, that really spurred the\nfield to think about: What was the nature of the first stars? How did they explode? What are the implications? Because if they're not as\nluminous and bright and energetic, that has consequences for\nthese early protogalaxies in which, you know, they must have been located\nin terms of, you know, blowing the gas out, let's say, and disrupting the system. So much higher chance\nfor the earlier system to stay intact for longer, right? So there's a whole tail of consequences. And this is what I mean with: We need to find the story, because you do you one thing\nand (mimics explosion), it's like the dominoes, there are consequences everywhere, and sudden you have a\ndifferent universe, right? - What could possibly\nbe a good explanation for something that yields a lot of carbon and doesn't yield a lot of iron? - Well, it's not so much an explanation, more like finding a\nmechanism for what happens in supernovae. And the official term, what was sort of, as I said, cooked up in order to\nexplain the observations... And we have, by the way, found a whole bunch more of these stars, so that holds. And it's called a fallback mechanism. So, actually, during\nthe supernova explosion, a massive black hole emerges. And so some of the material falls back onto the black hole. - Oh boy.\n- So here is a vacuum cleaner now plopped into the middle, right? - [Lex] Like a temporary\none that just cleans up some of the elements?\n- Well, sort of, right? Because if you think of the... We haven't talked about this yet, but if you know what a star looks like, a massive star looks like in its interior before it explodes, you have hydrogen and helium\nstill on the outskirts and then layers of heavier\nand heavier elements all the way up to iron. So you have an iron core in the center. And because you can't get\nany energy out of iron when you wanna fuse to\niron atoms anymore, right, that's when the supernova\nexplodes, occurs really. It's actually an implosion first and then you have a bounce of\nthe sort of neutron star phase that occurs in the process\nand then, you know, star gets disrupted.\n- That is so awesome. - Yeah, it's like this giant, you know, basketball (mimics implosion) and then (mimics explosion) it all goes out.\n- So implosion first, explosion after.\n- Yeah. And so in the process, right, if you make your black\nhole basically big enough, it will suck away some of the iron because that's the closest\nin terms of the layers; you hold onto it, you don't let it escape. And carbon is much further\nout, you let it all go. - Nice.\n- And so- - [Lex'] So that explains\nwhy you can have a big oomph and not much iron yield. - Yes. Yes. - So does explained the HE 1327- - Correct.\n- and others like it? - Yes. So there's a... It's well established now that the lower the iron\nabundance of the stars are, the higher the carbon sort of gets. And carbon is such an interesting\nelement in that regard. If we come back to the formation of the first low-mass stars, right? So we had the hotter gas,\njust hydrogen and helium, that made the first stars, there were hundred solar masses or so because the gas couldn't cool enough, so they were big and puffy. Carbon then, coming from the first stars, probably led to enough\ncooling in these gas clouds that enabled the formation\nof the first low-mass stars. So think about what happened if there wouldn't have been any carbon or the properties of the\ncarbon atom would be different, it would not have cooled the gas in such significant ways, perhaps, there wouldn't be any low-mass stars. We wouldn't be here today, right? And we're carbon based. And so I think carbon is really\nthe most important element in the universe for a variety of reasons, because it just enabled\nthis whole evolution that we are now observing and literally seeing in the sky. And it's really fascinating. - So combined with the fact that you have the iron-deficient, so all of that is probably\nimportant to creating humans. - Yeah. Yeah. We need all the elements. But if you don't have stars,\nyou know, like the sun, small stars, that can\nactually host planets, that have long lifetimes... You need long, long lifetimes if you want\nto have a stable planet and develop humans. - [Lex] So carbon is kind\nof important in many ways. - Yes, yes. - This is perhaps a interesting tangent. If I could just mention that you interviewed Mildred Dresselhaus of \"Carbon Queen: The Remarkable Life of\nthe Nanoscience Pioneer.\" Is there something you could say about the magic of carbon\nand the magic of Millie? (Anna laughs) - Well, Millie was certainly magic. She was a professor at\nMIT for many decades. I met her a number of times. Her photograph actually... A young and an older\nMillie is still on the wall every time I step out of the elevator in one of the buildings, I see it. She pioneered all sorts\nof carbon nano work. So she was a material scientist, very far removed from what\nI do on a daily basis. But, yes, carbon has amazing\nproperties when you study it. And, again, that's indeed another aspect of why carbon is so fascinating, not just in the cosmos\nbut also for us, you know, making us, creating us, in\nthe way that we can use it. It's wonderful. - Do you sometimes think\nabout this chemical evolution in this big philosophical way, that we're the results of\nthat chemical evolution, like we're made of this stuff, like we're made of carbon. - Yes. We're made of star stuff. Carl Sagan got it right. (laughs) - I mean , it's almost\nlike a cliche statement, but it's also a materials, a chemical, a physics statement, that we came from hydrogen and helium and somehow these formations created this interesting\ncomplexity of soup that made us. What are we supposed to make of that? Like, what? Did we just get really lucky? Why do we get all this cool stuff? - [Anna] Yeah, that's a\ngood question. (laughs) - I don't think it's a\nquestion that has an answer. I keep just asking why. But it is just this incredible mystery. So much cool stuff had to happen. So much, sorry, hot stuff had to happen to create us.\n- Well, right. And so much could have gone wrong and there would've been\nanother outcome, you know? And it's actually amazing how many things kind of fell in place. I mean, maybe that's all\nsort of self deterministic in some ways, right? We are who we are because\nthat was the path. (laughs) Maybe we would've ended up\nbeing robots, I don't know. But it's certainly wonderful\nto, you know, as scientists, for us to help contribute unraveling our cosmic history, right? I always say the biological evolution on Earth was, you know, absolutely facilitated\nby the chemical evolution of the universe, right? And one doesn't go without the other, certainly from a human perspective. - That evolution seems to be creating more and more complexity. The kind of interesting\nclumping of cool stuff seems to be accelerating and increasing. And it's hard not to see, as humans, that there's some kind of purpose to it, like a momentum towards\ncomplexity and beauty, you know? - Well, beauty is in the eye\nof the beholder. (laughs) But, yes, everything\ngets more complicated. - But there's also a beauty to the chemically pristine\nuniverse in the early days. - Certainly is, yes. I love the desert with it's nothingness; it has much aesthetics and appeal. - We came from nothing,\nwe'll return to nothing. So what about HE 1523? What's exciting? A red giant star. - [Anna] Yes. - That's another one of your babies. - [Anna] Yes. - 13.2 billion years old. - Yeah. So that one isn't quite as iron\ndeficient as the other one, so probably not a second-generation star, but easily second, third, sorry, third, fourth, fifth or so. We can't really pin it down. But it's also not super important for us. What is important is that that star has a very different chemical composition in the sense that, yes, we have all the elements up to iron there. They have sort of normal ratios, which means kind of the\nsame as most other old stars and not too different from the\nsun, or, at least, you know, different in quantifiable ways. But it has this huge overload\nof very heavy elements. And what was so nice about\nthat star in particular was that I could measure the thorium and the uranium abundance. And, again, that was\nthe second of its kind. But the uranium abundance\ncould be more well determined, so we had a better grasp on that. Now, why are thorium\nand uranium interesting? They are radioactive elements, they decay. Thorium has a half life of\n14 billion years, I believe., and uranium of 4.7, which, you know, to folks and us on Earth\nis a really long time. But those kind of\ntimelines are really good when you wanna explore the\nearly universe. (laughs) So there are two questions\nnow that kind of come to mind. Where do these elements come from? And what do they tell us? Right? And these, as we know, these heavy elements are\nmade in a specific process. It's a neutron-capture process usually referred to as the r-process, for rapid neutron-capture process. We talked about seed nuclei before, right? So we still don't exactly know where this process can occur. So you have, let's say, a\nlone iron atom somewhere, and it is in an environment where you have a strong neutron flux, which means there must be\nlots of neutrons around. And,.again, when we talk about the site, we can surmise and ponder\nwhere that might be the case. But you have this iron atom and you bombard it with neutrons, and you do it incredibly fast. Now, what happens in the process? That iron atom, you know, you collect lots of neutrons, it becomes really big and unstable. So it's a heavy neutron-rich nucleus that wants to decay (laughs) because it's not stable, it's way too big. And so let's say you add\nonly one neutron to it, that would already make it unstable, so it will then... It has a characteristic decay time that's called the beta decay timescale, so it will decay to a stable nucleus. So the neutron will convert to a proton, and that makes it stable. If you now bombard lots and\nlots and lots of neutrons onto that seed nucleus within that timescale of the beta decay, that's how you get to this huge, fat neutron-rich nucleus that\nthen wants to decay, right? So the rapid process, as you have your seed\nnuclei, they get bombarded, you create these really\nheavy neutron-rich nuclei, they're heavier than uranium even. The neutron flux stops and then all these heavy nuclei, they decay and they make\nall these stable isotopes that we know of, all the way up to thorium and uranium. - So that rapid nuclei decay is what creates all the- - Correct. And the whole thing is done\nwithin two seconds. (chuckles) So just to add to the rapid here, (fingers snap) in literally the snapping\nof my hand, it's all there. In my talks, I often, I have this nice simulation\nthat illustrates, you know, this creation of these heavy nuclei. And I always say, \"This is the only\nsimulation you will ever see that's slower than real time.\" Because in astronomy, you know, we show, \"Oh, this is how a galaxy forms,\" 13 billion years in 30 seconds. Really short, right? This is the opposite. Me showing you this, the\nelements are long made. - So where and when does this happen, does this process happen? - So you need the strong neutron flux. - [Lex] That's the\nclumping of the neutrons at the nuclei?\n- Yes, that's right. And so there are not\nthat many options, right? So where do you find lots\nof neutrons in the universe? So it's neutron stars, right? Neutron stars form in\nthe making of supernovae, of the explosions. Okay, so maybe some of this heavy material gets sort of made in the making\nof the supernova explosion and then gets expelled. Or you have neutron stars, so, you know, if the neutron star... I mean, usually that's the\nleftover of the supernova. If you have two from a binary pair... So stars usually actually\nshow up in pairs, and so it's not too unusual to create a pair of neutron stars that will still orbit each other after both of their progenitor\nstars have exploded. And those two neutron stars will orbit each other diligently. But as we know now, thanks to LIGO, the gravitational wave observatory, I mean, we know already that before, but now it's been measured by LIGO, is that these two neutron stars, they will orbit each\nother for like forever, but in the process they will lose energy. So that orbit is what\nwe call the orbit decays and eventually the two\nneutron stars will merge. And that results in an explosive event that has roughly the\nenergy of a supernova, but the process is completely different. And the cool thing is when\nthese two neutron stars collide, they produce a\ngravitational wave signature because neutron stars\nare super dense objects, they're like giant atomic nucleuses. So there's a lot of interesting\nphysics happening already. And so if you basically\nform a super neutron star by smashing two into each other, more interesting physics happens. And that means that there's\nthis ripple sent out, you know, into the space time continuum,\nbasically, you know, the... What do people say? The ripples of space time, you know? It's like you drop a\nrock into water, right, you see the waves coming. So that's exactly what happens when two neutron stars merge. And this is neutrons galore, right? It's really violent to smash\ntwo neutron stars, you know, that are so dense already into each other. And in 2017, one of these events occurred. And the LIGO and Virgo\ngravitational wave observatories, they detected that. And then the astronomers pointed their telescopes in that direction and they indeed observed what we call the\nelectromagnetic counterpart. So there was something seen in the sky that faded over the course of two weeks. And that light curve, that light, was exactly what you get when you create all these heavy neutron-rich\nnuclei in the r-process. And then the neutron flux stops and then it takes about two or three weeks for most of them, of these nuclei, to decay to stability. So we saw, the astronomer saw,. in this\nelectromagnetic counterpart, the nuclear synthesis of\nheavy elements occurring. And that's just awesome.\n- That's amazing. - It's so awesome. - That's electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational\nwaves that were detected with two neutron stars colliding aggressively, violently, to create a super neutron star. And that's where you get all the neutrons and neutron flux somehow. And then the whole shebang, that happens in two seconds and creates a bunch of heavy elements. - So that confirmed that\none of the sites, for sure, for the r-process to occur\nis neutron star mergers. Interestingly enough, I\nhave to mention this here, a year prior, in 2016, my former grad student Alex Ji and I, we discovered a small dwarf galaxy that is currently orbiting the Milky Way, it's called Reticulum II, that was full of ancient\niron-deficient stars that also had a strong signature of these heavy elements\nexactly like HE 1523. We weren't looking for that. I actually wanted to prove that they had really low\nlevels of heavy elements because that's what we had seen in all the other dwarf galaxies. And I was dead set on showing that that is yet the case again and that that is a typical signature of early star formation. We already talked about low\nstrontium and barium abundances in the oldest stars, right? This is what we had seen anecdotally in the ancient dwarf galaxies\nthat are surrounding us. - So that's an ancient dwarf galaxy? That dwarf galaxy has a\nbunch of ancient stars in it. - Yes. Yes. And so now we find Reticulum\nII, and it has these, the stars show the signature of the rapid neutron-capture\nprocess, the r-process. And we are like, \"Okay, these stars are located in\na dwarf galaxy right now. We have environmental information. They're not lost in the galaxy where we don't know where\nthey actually came from. No, we know these stars who\nwere formed in that galaxy because they're still in it.\" And we already deduced from that that it must have been\na neutron star merger that went off in Reticulum\nII at early times that polluted the gas from which all our little stars formed. - Can you speak to what a dwarf galaxy is? Can you speak to what this\nReticulum II dwarf galaxy is that is orbiting the Milk Way galaxy? It's going to be eaten by it, presumably- - It totally is going\nto be eaten. (laughs) I can't tell you exactly when. Yeah, the Milky Way remains surrounded by dozens of small dwarf galaxies. They're collections of stars. Some of them, we call them ultra-faint dwarf galaxies because they now only\ncontain, I don't know, a few thousand stars; very, very faint. - [Lex] But still detectable? - Yes, because they're fairly close. And we detect actual\nindividual stars in them. So I've observed some of the\nfaintest stars, you know, you can possibly observe\nwith current telescopes in these dwarf galaxies\nbecause I was like, \"I need to know what the\nchemical composition is,\" because there are leftovers\nfrom the early universe, right? They did not get eaten. So they're still in their\nnative surroundings. It's like getting the\nlions in the wild, right? I gotta study those and compare to the counterparts that got eaten and are\nnow in the Milky Way. And so I- - So presumably most of those stars, it's not all of those\nstars in that dwarf galaxy that are really ancient. - They're all really ancient, because actually, as it turns out, if you have a small galaxy... There was a process\nearly on in the universe called re-ionization that\nkind of heated up everything. And together with some\nsupernova explosions in an early, shallow,\nyou know, bound system, all these little systems lost their gas. It was sort of blown out or\nit simply evaporated, or both, probably both. And so these systems have been unable to continue to form stars since. So it's the best, for us\nstellar archeologists, that you could hope for, because it's a whole bunch\nof stars still sitting there, it's not just one, it's a whole bunch of them\nstill sitting there ever since. And nothing has, literally nothing has happened to them. They've just been waiting there for us. - So from a stellar\narcheology perspective, what is like juicier more interesting, the old stars in the outskirts\nthat have been eaten, on the outskirts of Milky Way, or the stars in the dwarf galaxies? Of all the things you love about the... You said you love stars, so which do you love\nmore of your children? - Hmm, oh, that's a hard one. I mean, I love them all, of corse. They serve different purposes. The stars in the Milky\nWay, I can get much, much, much better data for them\nbecause they're brighter. They're closer, so they're brighter. And that tickles my fancy. (chuckles) - And they have interesting\nkinematics, presumably. - Yes, and we can get that. And so HE 1523, for example, you know, that one is really bright. Only it's a red giant, so it's intrinsically bright\nand it's fairly close. And so the data I got for\nthat was insanely good and that yielded this uranium detection and thorium detection. I can never get that kind of data for a dwarf galaxy star, so that's a big trade off. But the environmental information that we get along with\nthe basic information about these stars in each\ndwarf galaxy is really, really valuable in establishing,\nyou know, for example, the site information, right? Because the galaxy is still there, so nothing crazy could have happened. So actually to close that loop, probably some heavy elements come out of supernovae here and there, but somehow my theory colleagues tell me that a normal supernova just\ndoesn't have enough oomph to really get an r-process\ngoing and doing it all. - So you need these orbiting supernova. - We need probably the\nneutrons star mergers or we need a special kind of supernova that's maybe extremely massive or heavily rotating or does\nsomething else funny, right, to really kinda get that\nparticular process going. But the normal supernovae\ndon't do it, right, so only a little bit comes out. But you could come along and say like, \"Anna, why don't you just\ntake 100 supernovae together to build up the yield?\" Right?\n- Mm-hmm. - But then I come along and say like, \"Look, this dwarf galaxy\nis still intact today. If you would've plugged in 100 supernovae into this little system early on, it would've blown apart.\" It would have blown apart\npast 5 supernovae or 10. So that's a really important\nconstraint that we have, that these systems are still alive, right? So it helps us to pin down where certain processes\ncould have possibly happened. And so it's just a different\ntype of information that we get. - It'd be amazing if we could talk about the observational aspect of this, the tools of observation. So what telescopes have\nyou used, do you use? And what does the data look like? And I think I've read a\nfew interesting stories about the actual process\nof day-to-day observation, a bunch of probably late nights. - Well, yeah, astronomers\nare doing it all night long, so we have lots of late nights. (laughs) - Can you explain the\nall-night-long aspect of it? - Well, let me start by\nsaying I mostly, these days, use the Magellan Telescopes in Chile. There are 6.5-meter telescope, which means the mirror\ndiameter is 6.5 meter. That's not the largest\nthat there is out there, but it's among the largest. And I use a spectrograph\nbecause I'm a spectroscopist. I don't take pictures. (laughs) And that particular\nspectrograph at that telescope is actually unusually efficient, so it kind of makes up for\nthe fact that the mirror isn't as large, you know, let's say the eight-meter telescopes from the Europeans or so. So I'm very happy with that. - Efficiency meaning? - How many photons get\ncollected sort of per time unit because that's always the limiting factor. Prior to the pandemic, we would travel to Chile\nto do our observations. Those telescopes are the... That's the last observatory where people were sort of supposed to travel there and take their own observations. Most other observatories basically have staff there by now who take the observations for you. - So there's the... Directly the scientists are specifying where to point the telescope and they're sitting there\nand collecting the data, making sure the data is collected well, the cleaning of the data,\nthe offloading of the data, all that kind of stuff? - Yeah, so it's mostly done for them. Obviously that's super\nconvenient, (chuckles) but it also takes away a central part of what the work of an astronomer is, which is data collection, right? We don't have an\nexperiment in the basement where we can go day and night or whenever we please and ask a certain question\nof the apparatus, right? \"Let's turn this knob\nand see what happens. Let's turn that knob up\nand see what happens.\" No, you know, we only have one experiment, which is the universe.. And what we see is what we get. (chuckles) And I think it's so important to take an active role in that. So I really love going to the observatory. I've taken many students\nthere over the years to teach them and to just show them what\nit means to be an astronomer. Because you go to these\nremote mountaintops, and it's such a magical environment. And you wait there, you know, for the sun to go down\nand then you get ready. And you look outside and it's\nsuch a serene environment. It's a little bit out of\nthis world. (chuckles) - You're sitting there. So the sun goes down, it's\nevening, late evening, and what does it look like? What are some of the\nmost magical experiences of that process? - Well, you know, when you're\non top of a mountain... You know, climbers, I guess, get to see that probably otherwise. It's very calm and the\ncolors are so beautiful. And I always become much\ncalmer when I'm there, A, because I'm just there\nfor one purpose only, that's data collection. I can say no to my emails, I can say no to everything\nelse because I'm observing. So there's literally less\ndistractions because, you know, you're just there to do one thing. - And also the emails\nsomehow seem less significant when you're looking up at the stars. - It's just you can afford\nto focus on this one thing, and it just kind of does something to you. It's a little hard to describe. But, you know, if you then fast forward, maybe I can speak a little bit about that. I have done a lot of\nastrophotography there as well, so... And observing faint dwarf\ngalaxy stars, you know, these are like 45 minutes,\n55-minute exposures, so you actually have a lot of time. So I would run outside\nand just lay on the ground under the southern Milky Way; beautiful, right, up, you know, there. And I would just lay there\nlike the snow angel, you know, (Anna laughs) and just stare up there and just kind of let my thoughts sort of pass through\nmy brain and just like, \"I'm one of it,\" right? We talked about this in the beginning. This is when I personally have the feeling that I'm a part of it, I belong here, rather than feeling kind of small. Yes, I'm small, but there are many other small things. And lots of small things\nmake one big whole, right? - And we're part of that big whole. So that's looking at the inner spirals of the Milky Way galaxy. - And just, you know, this\ndark sky with the bright stars. And I have described this\nin my book years ago. If the Milky Way is all bright above you, you don't need a moon or anything, you can walk in the starlight\nand you will find your way. There are no trees there\nfor safety reasons, but you wouldn't even\nrun into a tree, right? I mean, you can see... You can almost see the shadow, you know, from the starlight because\nit's such a dark site and the stars are so bright. And these are kind of moments that kind of change you a little bit. And it's-\n- You see the unity of it all. - Yeah, and it's just you and nature. And, you know, with modern\ncivilization and all of that, I think we often try a little bit too hard to be removed from nature, you know, to be independent of it\nand figuring it all out; but at the end of the day,\nwe're just a part of it. And that really helps me\nto remember that, you know, we're one and the same. - Well, that fills me with hope that... 'Cause I tend to think of us humans as in the very early days\nof whatever the heck we are. And so that makes me think\nthousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years from now, that we'll be reaching... Whatever we become will\nbe traveling out there to explore more and more and more. So what you're doing is the\nearly days of exploration with the tools we have. - Yes, the early seafarers\nlooking at the sky for navigation. (laughs) - Coming up with different theories of what's on the other\nside, that the Earth, starting to gain an intuition\nthat the Earth may be around and that we might be able to\nnavigate all the way around to get to the financial benefits of getting spices from India\nor whatever the reason, whatever the grant funding\nprocess is all about. But ultimately it actually results in a deep understanding of the\nmystery that's all around us. And, I mean, just to travel out there... I mean, to me, the discovery\nof life in the solar system, I really hope to see that in my lifetime, some kind of life, bacteria,\nsomething, maybe dead, because that means\nthere's life everywhere, and that's just the kind of stuff that might be out there, all the different\nenvironmental conditions, chemically speaking, that are out there. And it just seems like\nwhen you look at Earth, life finds a way to survive, to thrive, in whatever conditions. And so maybe that process\njust kinda humbles you. And it's super exciting to know\nthat there is life out there of different forms. And of course that raises the question of: What is life even? We tend to have a very\nhuman-centric perspective of what is a living organism and what is intelligence and\nall these kinds of stuff. And all the work in\nartificial intelligence now is starting to challenge our ideas of what makes human beings special. And I think we're doing that\nthrough all kinds of ways, and I think you're working\nsome part doing that as well. Like, the unity you feel is realizing we're part of this big\nmechanism of nature, whatever that is, that's creating all kinds of\ncool stuff from the humble, pristine origins to today. So what is... If you could just kinda linger\non the process of the data, what does the data look like? And how does the raw\ndata lead to a discovery of an ancient star? - Well, as a spectroscopist, we have to, I guess, talk for a brief moment\nabout what a spectrum is. Everyone, I hope, has\nseen a rainbow in the sky. That is basically what we're doing. We don't send the starlight\nthrough a raindrop that then gets bounced around and splits up the light\ninto the rainbow colors, we do it with a spectrograph, so basically a prism. So we send the starlight\nthrough a prism of sorts and that splits it up and\nthen we record exactly that. So it's a little 2D picture\nactually of a spectrum. Now, it's not gonna look\ncolorful, just black and white. Different colors have, of\ncourse, different energies, that's what we record. More specifically, we\nrecord as wavelengths. So wavelengths and frequency and energy, it's all the same at the end of the day. We process that little image in a sense that we do a cross cut and then sum up a few columns so that we get all the\ndata that we recorded. And what we see is a, (laughs) it's a bit funny to\ndescribe just with words, but a wriggly line with lots of dips. So the 2D process spectrum,\nwe call it continuum, so it's just a flat line, basically, and then there are dips. So the interesting things are the dips. If you think back of the rainbow, what we actually see in our\nstars is not just a rainbow, but it would be a rainbow with\nlots of black lines in it, which means certain little pieces of color have been eaten away by a certain amount and so we can no longer see\nit as well or not at all. Why is that happening? So if we come back to our stars, what we're observing, we're observing the stellar surface. We can actually never peer\nwith our telescopes inside, we only ever can go after the surface. And the surface contains, or the surface layer contains\ndifferent kinds of elements. Every one of those types of atoms, so elements are just\ndifferent types of atoms, they absorb different photons that are coming from the hot core where the fusion is occurring. And so that means that if you\nare the observer, you know, with a spectrograph or without, you will see the starlight. But certain frequencies, certain energies of that\nlight will have been absorbed by all the different atoms in the gas, so you see less of them. And so those are the dips. And the strength of the\ndips tell us, you know, which element was it and\nhow much of that element was or is in the star. So we have many, many, many dips. The solar spectrum, for\nreference, you know, all the dips are overlapping because the abundance of\nall the elements is so high, it's actually very complicated spectrum. My spectra really look\nlike a straight line and then there's a dip here and then you have the straight line, again there's a dip there. The sun doesn't have\nstraight lines, I mean, it's just all absorbed\nin some form or another. But the old stars have so\nlittle of all the elements that only occasionally these\ndips that then indicate, \"Okay, that one at that\nwavelength was iron. And here we have carbon, and\nthere's magnesium, and sodium. And, oh, there's a little\nstrontium line here.\" So we have a much easier\nway to map out this barcode that the spectrum, you know, pretty much is at the end of the day and to then measure the strength of these, we call it absorption\nlines, to then calculate, with existing codes that mimic the physics of the sellar atmospheres, like how much was absorbed, how many, what kind of elements were present in the stellar atmosphere. And so this is how we get to\nour abundance measurements and then altogether that gives\nus the chemical composition and that particular\nsignature in that star. - Do you ever look at\nlike the raw spectrograph and the absorption line\nand your able to see, intuit some interesting, non-standard outlier kind of patterns? Or does this have to do\nheavy amount of processing? - We actually process our... It's fairly straightforward\nto do our processing. We do it at the telescope. So I often take a shorter exposure first, let's say 10 or 15 minutes. So mostly when I do discovery work, we would just take a quick-look spectrum, then we process it while\nwe observe the next star, then we take a quick look. We have what I call the summary plot. It's a collection of little\nareas in the spectrum that have the key positions, the positions of the key elements in it. And it's kinda like reading\nthe tea leaves. (laughs) I have stared at so many spectra, I just need to know, I just need to see our summary plot and I can tell you exactly what the numbers are going to be. - And also to tell if\nit's going to be promising to look at further?\n- Yes, exactly. And so it's thumbs up,\nthumbs down. (laughs) Are you worth my time or not? In most cases, it's not. Or it's good enough, we\ncan do a basic analysis, maybe publish this as\npart of a larger sample, just so, you know, we output that we have observed the star and their basic nature. That's an important\npart to publish as well. And, yeah, I had a run... So now we do remote observing. I do all of this now from my\nhome, from my living room, all night long. (laughs) And I often work with colleagues. So we do it over Zoom\nand we process the data, we look at it, same thing still. And we just found a star that\nhad a very low iron abundance and then we decided, \"Okay,\nthat looks interesting. We're just gonna keep exposing.\" So we took more data on it on the spot and we're writing up the paper right now. - How do you know where\nto point the telescope? - It's not random. There's a lot of work that goes into that. I began my career by trying\nto answer that question, as in like doing the search process. That's why I called my book, that I've written some time ago, \"Searching for the Oldest Stars,\" because searching is one thing,\nit's very time consuming. And then on top of that,\nnot everyone finds, right? And I often don't find, but I keep searching because, you know, our techniques have established that, yes, we can do it if we're just patient enough and keep going because\nit's a numbers game. And that's often the case in science. And that's something that... Not enough is talked\nabout how tedious it is and how long it takes to get\nto that one discovery, right, that moves the field further. - And how difficult it is to believe that there is a thing to be discovered. - Yes, yes. We have this saying, I learned this, I think,\nfrom my supervisor, \"One star is a discovery, two is a sample, and three is a population.\" So as soon as you found three\nof roughly the same kind, you are done, but you need to get there. (chuckles) - [Lex] Yeah. Probably the\nfirst is the hardest, right? - Yes. But it kind of remains really hard. But the thing is then at past three, many of us are like, \"Okay,\nwe've solved that problem. We've shown it three\ntimes, so we can do it.\" That's a thing, right? That's a population. Three iron-deficient\nstars, let's say, right, that's one puzzle piece, now we can move on to the next thing. - That's an indicator that\nthere's many more of them, potentially.\n- Yes, yes, yes. So to cut a long story\nshort about the searching, we started early on with what's called\nlow-resolution spectroscopy of many stars. So, for example, my thesis\nwork, almost 20 years ago, was piggybacking off a quasar survey that had collected. So quasars are basically\ngiant supermassive black holes that are really far away. So you only see a one\nbig bright light point. So it looks like a star, but it's actually just a\ngiant supermassive black hole that out shines its own galaxy. And people have been trying to study those and they had taken little\nspectra of, you know, all things in the sky. And it turns out, oh, you can fish out the\nactual stars from that and look for certain signatures that might indicate low-metallicity stars, so stars with low abundances. And so it was painstaking work to then take\nmedium-resolution spectroscopy to get a little bit more information and to use approximations\nand to kind of get candidates that we can then eventually take to the big glass like Magellan to get a high resolution spectrum so we really see the dips of\nall the individual elements that then give us a final answer: Is it yay or a nay? (chuckles) These days, with another grad student, I developed a new technique to use images actually of\nall the stars in the sky taken with very narrow filters. So it's like you're wearing\nvery specific glasses that only lets so much light through. And so we can do similar things through having several\nnarrow-band filters, what we call it, to fish out things that have, you know, no absorption over here,\nso just the straight line, and then a little dip here,\nso a little something there. And that has proven fairly\nsuccessful in recent years. - So looking at the entire, looking at broader regions of space? - That's right. Because these stars are a little bit like the needle in the haystack, right? There are not that many left over. And certainly the galaxy has made plenty of stars in between; we need to comb through all\nof those to get to the goods. So we always start with millions\nand then work our way down, and in the end we have\nlike three good candidates. - I wonder how those ancient stars feel that they were noticed. They probably know that\nnobody pays attention. No, I'm just kidding.\n- We're all special, right? So are the stars. - It's good, it's inspiring, even if you're the outcast. In your pristine nature, you still might nevertheless be noticed. I'm hoping the same about humans, if somebody's observing us. Is there something else you could say that's about the challenges of this kind of high-precision measurement that you're doing, so this kind of collection\nof data, looking, trying to kinda pull out the signal from the noise out there? - Well, that's literally what we are doing in multiple ways actually. So we're trying to find\na needle in the haystack and then we find something and then it turns out it's\njust a little bit too faint to actually get the kind\nof data quality on it that we would like or that would be warranted given the potential of the star, right? It's like (groans). - So there's always noise, there's always a little bit of noise, and you have to try to say like, yeah, \"How special is this,\" when you're looking at\nthe absorption line? How-\n- Yeah. So the most iron-poor stars, their iron lines are so tiny that they're literally, you\nknow, almost in the noise. So you need incredibly good\ndata to make detections. And the funny thing is we're looking for the nothingness of,\nlet's say, the iron lines, but then we don't want nothing because if there's\nnothing in the spectrum, we can't measure anything, we can only get an upper limit. But we'd really like a measurement. So we are looking for the last little bit that you could possibly detect, and that's a strong function\nof the brightness of the star because the telescopes have\nthe size that they do that, that's not gonna change for a while; hopefully eventually it will, but it's gonna be at least 10 years out. And so, yes, we're often literally stuck in the noise because we can't make the measurement. So actually the record holder for the most iron-poor star\nonly has an upper limit. We can't get enough data on this to actually pinpoint a measurement to then take it to our theory\ncolleagues and say like, \"Give me this little iron\nout of your first star.\" (Anna laughs) So it's a bit frustrating, but also super exciting at the same time. - So let's go to both\nside of that spectrum. What's like the most exciting\ndiscovery to you personally? Is there a moment you remember\nthat you saw a piece of data and you kind of, your heart skipped a bit? - Yeah, yeah, of course. - Is it HE 1327? - That was definitely\none of those moments. I wasn't actually\npresent at the telescope, but we were sent the data\nimmediately from our colleague. And we just looked at it and our eyes got really wide and was like, \"Oh, my god. (laughs) Is this really what we think it is?\" So we had to run some numbers and it was. And these are magical little moments. The thing is, you know, often\nwe have false positives. And so there's always this kind of period, and often it's, I don't know, 10, 15 minutes where you\nneed to make some tests to kind of make the decision: \"Is this really something I\nshould keep observing now? Is this really as good as I think or am I being fooled by something?\" Right? So, actually, if you take a\nspectrum of a white dwarf... A white dwarf is the leftover core of a star like the sun\nthat has gone extinct. And white dwarfs have lost\nall their a outer atmosphere, so it's just a hydrogen and helium core. So they look like a metal-poor style because there's only\nhydrogen helium left, right? But the hydrogen lines that\nyou can see in the spectrum of our stars and of the white dwarfs are a little bit wider than normal. So you need to have a good\neye just to check, you know, \"Does this look a little\nbit wider than it does? Is this a white dwarf\nwho's fooling me here?\" Right? And so it's like this moment,\nit's like, \"Oh, my god.\" - [Lex] It's just minutes of nervousness. - Yes. Yes. And sometimes, you know, it's a dud and sometimes it's not. - What's been a big, that\nyou remember, heartbreak, like a painful low point? Is it all leading up to\nthe first... (laughs) Is it all about HE 1327 again, just the leading up to it? Or has there been like a... Yeah, has there been like\nlow points in the search? - That's a good question. I mean, you know, it starts with mundane things as in like you won your telescope time, you traveled there, and the weather is\ncompletely cloudy, it rains, and you had three nights, which is a lot, and you go home empty-handed. So that's definitely a low point. (laughs) Probably not what you were thinking of, but there is a certain\noccupational hazard to it. - Which requires a kinda\nresilience and a patience. - Yeah. And you just gotta\nlearn to live with it. Coming back to Reticulum\nII, actually, you know, that little dwarf galaxy, that was a run that we had and the weather was incredibly bad. And I had sent my student there. And I was at home, and he calls me at 2:00\nAM and he was like, \"Anna, I think I observed the wrong star. I'm so sorry. There is this line there,\nthis europium line, and it looks like a metal-rich star.\" And I was like, \"It's cool. We all make mistakes. Send me the data, send\nme that summary plot.\" And so I look at it, you know, I was like super tired, and it's like, \"I can't really tell. It doesn't look wrong, but I can't tell you right\nnow that it's right either.\" So why don't you go to the next target? And he calls me back an hour later, \"Anna, it looks just the same. What am I supposed to do?\" And then I joked, \"Well, maybe\nwe found an r-process galaxy. Let's go to the next one.\" And the weather was degrading. And so to cut a long story\nshort, we had to come... So he was observing the right stars. It was an r-process galaxy, the first one we had ever discovered. Totally, I mean, unpredicted. We had no idea that this was a thing. I mean, you know, of course\nwe thought that, you know, such a thing might possibly\nexist because why not, right? Neutron star mergers happen somewhere, crazy supernovae probably too. But we were not prepared in\nthat moment to find this thing. And in the end, the weather\nwas getting worse and worse. And we wanted to see\nhow many r-process stars are in this galaxy. So we managed, by a hairline, to observe the nine brightest stars, but the data quality was atrocious. - [Lex] And the weather\naffects the data quality? - Yes, absolutely. Because these were really faint stars. And so we were really lucky by making a very tight strategy of getting the absolute bare\nminimum for all the stars so we could at least\ntake a very crude look: \"Is it a yay or it's a nay?\" We couldn't even say yes or no, just to get an idea\nbecause we needed to know. Why was that important? Because we could only\nobserve this system again nine months later. - [Lex] So there's always\na window of observation. - Yes, it was setting. This was our chance. And it was going away\nwith the clouds, you know? - [Lex] That was super high stakes. - But we just made it, like, really, it was almost impossible. And it was just... The thing is... This is such a serendipitous moment in a serendipitous moment. The enhancement of these\nheavy elements was so strong that even in this really crappy data, we could still see the enhancement, right? The absorption was so strong that it stuck out of the noise. If the enhancement wouldn't\nhave been as strong, we would not have been\nable to say anything because we wouldn't\nhave been able to tell. But because it was so extreme, it lend us a hand, despite\nthe weather and all, to say like, \"Yes, this is it.\" So that was quite the night. (laughs) - Luck. I mean, a lot\nof this is just luck. So that was the first\nr-process galaxy discovered? - Yes. I didn't sleep all that\nmuch that night. (laughs) - Do you have hope... Are you excited about\nJames Webb Space Telescope and other telescopes in the future that increase the resolution and the precision of what\ncan be detected out there? - Absolutely. JWST is fantastic already. I am not planning to use it personally, although I think I'm on one or two observing proposals actually. Because similar to what\nwe already spoke about, we're interested in the same thing, we are just kind of looking at different sides of the fence, right? I have my old surviving stars and I concoct these little stories about what the earliest\ngalaxies may have looked like, what the objects were that\ncontributed, you know, energy and elements and all these things. And my JWST colleagues, they try to detect some\nof these earliest photons from these earliest systems to look at the energetics\nand other things, you know, what was there, how many, these kinds of things, right? So together we're trying to explore this first billion years, but we do it in very complimentary ways. And so I'm very excited to\nsee what they can come up with and how that helps me to\ninform my stories better and more comprehensively. - What do you think is the future of the field of stellar archeology? How much can we... Maybe what are the limits\nof our understanding of this first billion\nyears of our universe? - Well, obviously lots of limitations in the sense that I always say, \"I have a metal-poor star\nfor any of your questions,\" because there are so many\ndifferent kinds out there. And we still find new\npatterns sometimes, right, and there needs to be an explanation. The question is: Is it ultimately just one quirky star or is it two or it three? Right? Is it a sample? Is it a population? So we haven't concluded\nthat kind of work yet. - So every metal-poor star\nis a kind of data point that you can use to improve\nthe quality of your model of the evolution of the early universe. - Yes, yes. And I would say we've made huge progress over the last 20 years. When I joined that field, it was in its infancy and there was this serendipitous discovery of that first second-generation star. And we have filled in the\ncanvas a great deal since then. And this is what I have\ngreatly enjoyed about doing so because there was so\nmuch discovery potential. And it's been dying down a little bit because of all the progress. It's on the up and coming again because there's so many\nlarge spectroscopic surveys in the works now that will just provide a\ndifferent level of data that we haven't had before. I'm sort of this of older generation. I have only very few colleagues,\nI work in small teams, and I observe every single\nstar myself that, you know... Whatever I can, I do myself. I don't generally take\nother people's data, at least certainly not in the end stage. And, you know, I'm not a\nbig data kind of person, although we're all headed that way. I certainly use data from the\nGaia astrometric satellite for the kinematics, for example. But that's personally a new thing for me to use sort of big-sky\nsurveys that are available. So it's still very sort of\nhand-grown field, you know, where we do our individual observations. I have enjoyed that a lot, but that's about to change. - So one star at a time.\n- Yes. - I mean, there's power to that, to build up intuition of\nthe absolutely universe by looking one star at a time. - Yeah. And this is how you can really drill down on the questions that you have, right, because you control what data you get, otherwise you have the\ndata that you have, right, you get what you get\nand you don't get upset. (Anna laughs) I don't like that. I'm a little bit snobby. I really like to formulate my questions, go to the telescope, and then come what may\nI will try to get it. - And also develop the intuition of where the data can be\nrelied upon and where it can't, and all the different quirks of the data and all that kind of stuff. - Sometimes a lot is lost in the aggregation of the noisy data. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And there always the danger, if you have someone else's data, that you just don't really\nunderstand, you know, the limitations, completeness things, how certain things were set up. And, you know, you get\nout what you put in, so I'm really particular about that. And it's certainly paid off for me. That's one of the main notions that I try to teach in my\nclasses and to my students, that you need to be able to formulate your question really well because otherwise you're\ngonna get an answer to a different question but you won't notice that the goalpost has shifted in the meantime, right? So your interpretation can only\nbe as good as the question. If you need to change your\nquestion, that's cool, do it, but then, you know, it needs to pair up with\nyour interpretation again. And so knowing, really being in the know about\nevery step of what happens, that leads to quality results, I think. That's why I have sometimes little trouble with sort of big data\nand statistical analysis. Yes, on average, that's true, I'm not debating that. But I'm the kind of person, I like to look at the outliers, so not the bulk, but, you\nknow, the special ones, and they just need to be\ntreated in a different way. And there needs to be an\nacknowledgement of that; different ways for different things. - So big data can look at divorce rates, and perhaps you and I are more interested in the individual love stories. - Yes. (Lex and Anna laughing) That works for me. - So I don't know if it's possible to say, but where do you think\nis the big discoveries that are waiting? Is it on the different\ndynamics of the yield, the common narrative, the common story of how some\nof these metal-poor stars are formed? Where are the discoveries in this field that you think will come? - I think the individual\ndiscoveries are actually... We've made most of those, certainly through individual stars. Finding yet another second-generation star is incredibly important for me but isn't really going to move the needle. Finding 50 of them or 100 of them, that would move the needle; but that's in order or two magnitudes up. And new search techniques and new surveys may enable that. But would you still call that a discovery? Right? - [Lex] So that's just a scale, that's a scale-\n- Yes. So I think about it more\nlike literally of the puzzle. Let's say you have a thousand-piece\npuzzle and, you know, you have 900 pieces in there. If you are a person like me, I wanna get to the last ones. I'm not gonna leave it just like, \"Okay, I see broadly what this\nis gonna look like,\" right? \"I'm done now.\" No, I wanna get to the last one. So is the picture\nglobally going to change? No. Are we gonna figure out all the details and how it really works? Yes, right? - So really careful, detailed map out-\n- Getting into it. - the ancient stars of our universe. - Yeah, because I think that's what... Many of the scientists are a\nlittle bit detailed obsessed. But I think that's our job too, right, to really kind of make it airtight, to really walk away saying,\n\"I fully understand this,\" not just broadly, but,\nyou know, I really know, we really know now. And so more and more of\nthat is going to happen. And so I think this is\nprobably true across astronomy, these individual 10-sigma\ndiscoveries become less and less. If they were easy, we would've\nmade them already, right? Which means we have made many of them. But really filling in the details is the next sort of level of discovery? Maybe we need to find a new word for that. The hopes and expectations that go along with the word\ndiscovery are so enormous. We may not always be\nable to live up to that. But it doesn't mean that we're\nnot finding out new things, it's just a different kind of quality because the questions have shifted. You close one door, suddenly there are 10 new open doors that we wanna explore and march through. And that's the, you know, finding these last puzzle\npieces here and there that really make it airtight. - And so there's a lot of value and a lot of power and\nbeauty to the discovery in the big picture of our\nuniverse and in the details. So both are really important.\n- Yes, we need both. Absolutely. - Perhaps drifting into the philosophical, let me ask about the Big Bang as we kinda encroach onto it. So your work is kind of taking\nsteps back through time, in a weird way. Do you think we'll get to\ndeeper and deeper understand the really, really early\ndays of the Big Bang? And the philosophical question: Do you think we'll be able to understand what was before the Big Bang or why the Big Bang happened? Do you think about that stuff? - Not with stars, for better or for worse, because, you know, stars only probe the time\nwhen they were formed, and the Big Bang is surely before then. I mean, I often talk to my students about the difference\nbetween math and physics. Let me give you an example. We talked earlier about\nHE 1523, and, you know, I was happy to share with you that I measured thorium and uranium, but I actually didn't\nquite close that loop. So we did this to try to attempt to calculate an age\nfor these stars, right? But they rely on us knowing\nhow the r-process works, how these elements are\ncreated, where it happens, and then how those elements get dispersed into the gas and end up in\nthe next generation star. So quite a few question marks. So that's how we got to the\nage of 13.2 billion years. This is probably not accurate, but this is the best\ncalculation we could do. And the reason why I'm bringing this up is that that was actually the average of multiple elemental ratios\nthat each gave a certain age, and then we averaged that, because, for better or for worse, this is the best we can do. So some of these numbers said, \"Oh, this star is 15 billion years old,\" and then others said, \"Oh,\nthis is 10 billion years old.\" And so I often use that\nin my class to say like, \"What's the good news and\nwhat's the bad news here? Some ratios say 15 some 10, right? Is 15 correct.\" And then I ask them and some\npeople will say something. And so the thing here is that it's an absolutely\ncorrect calculation given the mathematical and physical model that we constructed, but does it make sense? No, it doesn't. If we believe the universe\nis 13.8 billion years old, 15 is ridiculous, yet it is correct. Isn't that interesting? - [Lex] Correct from a\nmathematics perspective. - Yes, it is not incorrect because this is what I calculated. Nobody made a mistake. Now, we can question\nwhether that's a good model, but that's a separate issue. - So you're saying physicists\nare much closer to truth than mathematicians? - Well, it depends.\n- I'm just kidding. - Sometimes yes and sometimes no, right? So what our job as physicists is, is to take the mathematical\nmodel, calculate our numbers, and then ask the question,\n\"Does this make sense?\" right? Now, in the case of 15 it doesn't. But we took the average anyway because that was the\nbest we could do, right? So, all right, let's put that aside. Let's apply the same sort of thinking to the Big Bang, right? Math can tell us things that\nwe as physicists cannot grasp because it doesn't make sense to us. Now, in the case of the Big Bang, that's a special case because\nwe don't actually know what's supposed to make sense. (laughs) And this is where things get interesting, but this is where math will\nultimately be the winner because we can no longer\nsay this makes sense or this doesn't make sense because the physics is broken down. - But math breaks down too\nat the singularity of things. - Well-\n- Or no. - depending on who you ask. - [Lex] Okay. Sure, sure. - This is the current question, right? How much further can we\npush math, let's say, to the front of the Big Bang? If there is such a thing. - What's the front and the back? What's the front? The front is the-\n- Well, before the Big Bang. - Oh, before the Big Bang? The front, okay. (Anna laughs) Just to clarify all the\ndoorways and the entrances. - So how far can we let the math go before that stops to make sense, right? And I don't know what\nthe answer is to that, but it's really cool\nbecause math doesn't have, is not limited by our physical nature, it can probably go a little\nbit further than the physics. - Yeah.\n- Right? - And math can go into more dimensions than four dimensions comfortably. - And it's judgment free because it just calculates\nthings on its own, whereas, as physicists,\nwe are so judgmental: \"This makes sense. This doesn't make sense,\" right? It doesn't get any worse. - It's such a beautiful dance. It's so amazing that through this dance you can explore the\norigins of the universe. Like, doesn't the Big\nBang just blow your mind, that this thing just started from a point and now we're here? - [Anna] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Hydrogen and helium and then all the stuff you're studying. I mean, this evolution of chemistry created humans and we're here talking. And here's a lot more to the story. It's amazing. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And this kind of march that you're doing is observing data. And is there... You're looking at old light and old data. - But only a few thousand years, right? - [Lex] Just a few thousand years. - That's the difference between\nme and my JWST colleagues. Their objects, that light has traveled 13 billion years, or whatever it was, to us, and they're observing that now. My light has only traveled\na few thousand years It's nothing. - So whatever you observe now is likely still going on. - Yes. These stars are alive and\nkicking and having a blast. - A thousand years, just a few thousand years is all it takes. If we can travel close\nto the speed of light maybe we can reach out there. - We wouldn't have any planets\naround those stars, though. - Is that a definitive intuition? - Well, what a planets made of? Elements, right? Take the Earth, it has all heavy elements, right? The universe needed to\nreach a certain stage first to have produced enough\nof all these elements to actually make a planet. - So on average you're... So, okay, right.\n- So that took quite a few billion years. - So they're not going to have a mechanism for forming planets. You could have visitors probably, but the kinematics of that\nare weird, are unlikely. - Yeah, I would say so. - Okay. So they're interesting in that they reveal the early chemical\nevolution of the universe? - [Anna] Yes. - Not that they're... They could be good\nvacation spots, but not... Well, if you like it warm. (laughs) Just no planet islands to go to to chill. - In your book, you highlight the major contributions in the field by many women. Some of these women were\nnot, as you describe, immediately credited\nfor their discoveries. So for me, from a computer\nscience perspective, the story you also tell\nis Harvard Computers. Who were these women? And what can you just say about the nature of science and humanity? - Discovering things is part\nof the human nature, right? And so it's happened for the longest time, not just by men but also\nby many women. (laughs) The field of stellar\nastronomy, which is my field, has particularly benefited from many discoveries made by women. You mentioned the Harvard Computers, that's a term used for women who worked about 100 years ago at the Harvard College Observatory. And they were hired for their low wages and willingness to do\ndiligent and patient work to comb through the big data of the day. So the observatory director, they were carrying out large\nsky service at the time, and they needed, that data needed to be processed and looked at and analyzed. And so many women, or several dozens, or, well, one or two dozen women over the years, were hired to do this work. And in the process, because they were looking\nat the actual data and they were smart, even though they had\noften no formal education, they made a lot of discoveries simply by being in tune\nwith what they were doing. So they weren't robots as, you know, the term computer would perhaps lead on. So Annie Jump Cannon classified thousands\nand thousands of spectra and found out that you can, you know, stars have different temperatures and their spectra look according. We still use that\nclassification sequence today. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin,\nlater on in, I think, 1925, was one of the first women to obtain a PhD in stellar astronomy. And she figured out, she calculated that the sun is mostly made of hydrogen and helium. That seems normal to\nmany of us these days, but at the time it was\nthought that celestial objects are made of the same thing as the Earth. - That's a gutsy, amazing discovery. - Yes. It was later termed the most\nimportant thesis of humankind or something like that. (laughs) What a revelation to realize that stars are made of\nhydrogen and helium, right? And this was exactly the time when people figured out\nwhy stars are shining, namely because of nuclear fusion and that it's protons and, you know, the tunneling effect that\nleads to the actual fusion, otherwise, you know, the protons repulse each other, they don't come together. And so what an incredible\ntime it was back then. And so stars and nuclear physics\nwere very closely related, and it remains, now it's called nuclear astrophysics. And so many women had many\ncontributions to that. Of course prior to that Marie Curie discovered two new elements. Ah, so awesome. (laughs) Radium and polonium. Lise Meitner discovered nuclear fission, that is the basis for\nunderstanding the r-process. This is exactly what\nhappens in the r-process. You know, the heavy\nnuclei, let's say uranium, if you bombard it with a neutron, we talked at length about\nit, it will decay... Well, not decay, actually. It will fission, it will split into barium\nand krypton, let's say, so two lighter elements. That's exactly what we observe. I have always a higher abundance of barium than the heavier elements\nbecause of this fission cycling that she calculated in 1938, 1939. So, many, many contributions. And it's just so remarkable. I you just take that body of work, that changed how we do things, how we see the universe,\nhow we understand things, has led to so many subsequent discoveries, good ones and bad. - Well, all of it just taken together, ultimate progress.\n- That's progress, right? Science is what it is, we have to decide what we do\nwith that knowledge, right? We can always use things\nfor good or for bad. That's part of the human endeavor as well. - And also part of the human endeavor and the human nature is the issues with corruption and credit assignment and all these kinds of things that make this whole\nride so damn interesting, about what's right and wrong and about the nature of good and evil. And that seems to surface itself in all kinds of places all the time still. - Yes, yes. Lise Meitner was nominated\nfor the Nobel Prize 40 times, more than that even. It's amazing. She holds the record for that. She never received it, so case in point. - Yeah. And, of course, the Nobel\nPrize has its complexities. One is the credit assignment; but two, even in astronomy, sort of assigning credit\nto a handful of folks when so many more contributed\nis a complicated story also. - [Anna] Yeah, it's very complex. - Okay, sorry for the romantic question, but what to you is the most\nbeautiful idea in astronomy, in stellar astronomy? - Well, so early on, you know, when I was in high school, I was thinking like, \"Okay, what do I wanna do when I grow up?\" Right? (chuckles) I knew I wanted to do astronomy, but I was a little bit torn because my interests\nwere definitely stars, stellar astronomy, but also chemistry. I always had a fascination\nabout the elements, so Marie Curie was a big role model. My friend actually made a beautiful, produced a beautiful movie about the discovery of the elements. It's a theater play, but digitized. When I saw it, I could actually kind of relive the sort of discovery\nmoment that Marie Curie had. It sent shivers down my spine. It was fantastic. I mean, this is the kind of thing that I wanted to experience. But, yeah, so nuclear physics and element creation and formation was really\ninteresting to me, chemistry, the elements,\nstars, and all of that. And I was like, \"I don't know if I ever find something that combines all of these things.\" And then I ended up in Australia, and met this person and he\nwas working on old stars. And as I was sitting in his talk, hearing about this for the\nfirst time, it kind of, it clicked all over my head and it's like, \"Oh, my god.\" It all fell in place because\nwe can use these old stars to study the elements, to learn how they're formed. We can get these clean\nsignatures that help us inform the nuclear synthesis processes, you know? And, of course, I need to\nknow a lot about stars too. So it's like all together. And that was sort of a moment of magic. And then the fact that I have\nnow done that for 20 years is just like I won the lottery. - It all clicked into place. And so in some sense it's an\nongoing love story for me, if I could say it like\nthat, where, you know, I found my stars, my thing, and I am fortunate enough to\nbe able to keep doing that. And I'm happy to see\nwhere it will take me. You know, it's an evolution. As with every relationship, if you don't march forward,\nyou move backwards. I'm not interested in moving backwards, so I'm letting the field\nand the discoveries and the findings lead me to... You know, and I'm often... It's not hard for me to\nfollow sort of my hunches. And sometimes even at\nthe telescope, it's like, \"Hmm, let's take a look at this one. I have a good feeling.\" And then usually something\ngood or, you know, not bad pop pops out at the end. And I really like that, A, that I have the freedom to do that, that I'm allowed to follow my hunches. Too many people, I think, are sort of boxed in with their job or their life that they don't\nhave that kind of freedom. That's really important to me, and I certainly try to make use of that. I also try to teach that to others, to trust them, to learn... You need to learn your things, but then you need to\nalso trust that knowledge and that you have a grasp on it, right? You get out what you put in. And being able to contribute\nin meaningful ways to our knowledge about\nour cosmic ancestry, our cosmic history, that's a wonderful thing. (laughs) - And in this way, your personal love story\nwith the stars evolves. What advice, you've already\nspoken to it a little bit, but what advice would\nyou give to young people that are trying to find\nthe same kind of love story in their career, in their life? - It seems increasingly\nhard for folks to find that. Sometimes I feel that, you know, young people have all the\nopportunities these days, and that's wonderful. But it's almost like that leads to some... What's the right word? They're a little bit too tired\nto make all the decisions because at some point you need\nto put your eggs in a basket and you need to be okay with that. We can't do all the things even though we're often told, \"You can be president too.\" And I think that's really\nimportant to convey. But at the end of the day, we can only have sort of one\njob or one type of profession. I'm not saying, you know,\nyou need to be locked in, but it's hard to change 180 degrees. And so lots of people, I think, are often afraid to really dig in at least for some time and\nget the hands real dirty and really learn from the bottom up. - [Lex] One thing. - On one thing, because they're afraid they're missing out on 99 other things. But life is a little bit\nmissing out on 99 other things because we only have 24 hours in a day. I have that feeling very often. There are so many things\nI would like to do, many things I would like\nto try to be good at. Sometimes I wish I had a\ndifferent job, you know, because I have other\ninterests too, but I realized, \"Okay, I can only do one thing.\" So I have no regrets. But this is a general feeling that I would think most of us have. But if it stops you from really digging, drilling down on one thing, to become an expert in one thing, to become really good at one\nthing that you call your own, then it just makes it difficult. - And so a fulfilling life is in part likely to be discovered in a singular pursuit of a thing, of one thing. - [Anna] Well, yeah or- - At least for a time. - Yeah, for some time, with your heart and your hands. Because I think most people\nlong to own something. You know, we all, I think, wanna leave some legacy of some sorts, you know, for our children, for humanity, for this planet. (laughs) And I think it's really important for young people to strive\nfor that and not lose sight or trade that for all the opportunities because an opportunity is nothing if you don't do anything. You need to do something\nat the end of the day. So I chat with lots of people about this, and I often start by just saying, \"Hey, tell me what you don't like,\" because it's often much easier to- - [Lex] Just narrow down,\nnarrow down, narrow down. - let out what's not on your plate, and then this way we\nget a little bit closer. And then it's like, \"Well,\nwhy don't you take a risk and just sign up for\nsomething for three months? You can afford that.\"\n- But that's what it feels like. That's what it feels like;\nand it is that, it's a risk. Commitment is a risk.\n- Yes. - Because it's you're\nbasically sacrificing all the other possible options. But then I guess you have to trust the magic you noticed in that thing. If you notice one thing,\njust stick with it. And then maybe there's something there. - Right, right. And this moment of kind of feeling it in your entire body and mind that this is the right thing, you know, getting there is probably really hard. But if you don't try, you won't find out. - The hard stuff is the fun stuff, that's also another thing to find out. - And then there is that. Yes. - Somehow, it doesn't make sense. You also mentioned that you\nhave taken a little stroll into the artistic\nrepresentation of yourself. Can you speak to that for a little bit? - Yes. Well, I already just mentioned\nsometimes I wish I, you know, had more time to do other things. So I find little sideways, I guess, to pursue things that I\nlike besides astronomy, or at least I try to find connections. And so some years ago, I, again, with the help of my friend who\nmade this Marie Curie movie, she and I wrote a one-woman play where I actually portray Lise Meitner who was an Austrian\nGerman nuclear physicist. I'm from Germany, so I have\nthe right accent for that. (Anna laughs) And we wrote this play about this moment of\ndiscovery of nuclear fission. Again, this is an\nabsolutely critical piece that explains my work today. And we all stand on\nthe shoulder of giants, she was one of those giants. And in some ways it's, of course, a way for me to acknowledge\nother people's work that have come before me. It's a wonderful way to highlight the contribution by a prominent woman. And the way I do it is it's a 25-minute play in costume where I re-live, for people,\nthe moment of discovery, then I turn into myself and then I give a 30-minute presentation on the r-process and the\ncreation of heavy elements because the audience can now\nperfectly understand that, the public audience, given the historic\nbackdrop of this discovery that they just lived, through my presentation. And it's a wonderful compliment that almost spans 100 years\nfrom one woman to the next passing on the torch. And, you know, when we write up our\nresults, let's say, you know, in magazines like \"Nature and Science,\" it's always about the results\non the golden platter, perfectly prepared. The discovery is never described, only ever the results. You asked me beforehand, right, \"What does it feel to be at\nthe telescope in this moment?\" Right? I'm happy to talk about this, but it's nowhere written ever, nobody really talks about it. And so having a form of, you know, theater of the arts to\nbring this exciting moment, that is what we all want to\nexperience as scientists, to a wider audience is so\nprofound and so rewarding. And they all love it because everyone can understand\na moment of discovery. I was looking for something\nand then I found it. It's like you misplaced\ncar keys, right? (laughs) - Or love.\n- Yes, yes. Everyone can understand that.\n- Both are glorious experiences, yes. - The implications and the findings, that is much harder to\nunderstand for anyone. this is where the\nscientists' work truly lies, this is our job. But the moment of discovery\nis easy and it's beautiful and it needs to be said. And so taking my audience on this journey: What is the perils? What are my worries? And then, \"Ah, here is\nthe moment of discovery. Let me tell you about it. It profoundly transformed me. And here's how it went,\" right? It's so good. - And art is a way to reveal this fundamental human side of science. - Yes, it's... The problem with science is\nthat it's people doing it. Maybe not a problem, but that is it.\n- That's also what makes it beautiful, right? I mean, humans are fascinating in that we're able to\ncome up with these ideas through all the struggle, through all the hardship,\nthrough all the hope, through all the search we find- - And so the art is a\ngreat way to portray that and to broadcast that, right? I think this is how the audience really should be\ninteracting with scientists, much less about the findings but really more about this\nyearning for answers, right? \"I need to find these car keys. I need it because I need to go,\" right? It's like, \"Now, now!\" (chuckles) And then, \"Oh, God, here it is. Now I can go my merry ways.\" It's so relatable. We just need to find more\nand better ways to do that. So I hope to turn this into\nalso a digitized version at some point to, again,\nmake it more accessible. - [Lex] I hope so too. I would love to see it\n- So far I'm just doing it in person, (laughs) but it's really nice. - I would love it. I think a lot of people\nwould love to see it, so hope you do just that. Let me ask you a big, ridiculous question. You look up at the stars, you\nlook up at the early, early, early stars. So let me ask the big question that we humans often ask\nand struggle to answer. What's the meaning of this whole thing? Why are we here? - We talked about, you know, the biological evolution\nrequires the chemical evolution for all of this to kind of play out, and carbon played this important role. And, you know, in some sense we're just a consequence of all of these things being\nthe way they are, right? So maybe this is just where we are supposed\nto be because, you know, the laws of physics sort\nof work the way they do. And we talked much about the\nvariety of everything, really, certainly, you know, from over here to over there, and things in the\nvicinity of where the sun and the solar system formed, they were the way they were and life maybe was a\nnecessary consequence of that. In some sense, I like to believe that because\nthen it becomes reproducible and we can apply that\nsame argument elsewhere. If it's total chance, right, that makes it harder. That's not truly\nsatisfying to a scientist. - So it's a consequence of\npsychological evolution, which is a consequence\nof biological evolution, which is a consequence\nof chemical evolution, consequence of physical\nevolution, whatever, whatever disciplines. It's turtles on top of turtles. - Turtles all the way\ndown, yes. (chuckles) - And you have studied some\nof the most ancient turtles at the very bottom of the thing. (Anna and Lex laughing) - That's right. That's right. They live for quite a while. - Yeah, they do. Well, thank you for your incredible work. Thank you for highlighting\nboth the human side and the deep scientific side. It's just, I'm a huge fan of your work. And thank you for everything you do. And thank you for talking today. This was awesome. - Of course. It was wonderful. Thank you. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Anna Frebel. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with\nsome words from Douglas Adams in \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\": \"Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end\nof the western spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small\nunregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance\nof roughly 92 million miles is an utterly insignificant\nlittle blue-green planet whose ape-descendant life forms\nare so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.\" Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time."

And I would just lay\nthere like the snow angel and just kind of let my thoughts sort of pass through my brain. And this is when I\npersonally have the feeling that I'm apart of it, I belong here, rather than feeling kind of small. Yes, I'm small, but there are many other small things. And lots of small things\nmake one big whole. - The following is a\nconversation with Anna Frebel, an astrophysicist at MIT studying the oldest stars\nin the Milky Way galaxy in order to understand the chemical and physical conditions\nof the early universe and how from that our\ngalaxy formed and evolved to what it is today, the place we humans call home. This is the \"Lex Fridman\nPodcast\"; to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Anna Frebel. Let's go back to the early days. What did the formation of the\nMilky Way galaxy look like? Or maybe we wanna start even before that. What did the formation of\nthe universe look like? - Well, we, scientists,\nbelieve there was the Big Bang, some big beginning. (chuckles) But what is important for my work, and I think that's what\nwe're going to talk about, is what kind of elements\nwere present at that time. So the Big Bang left a universe behind that was made of just hydrogen helium and tiny little sprinkles of lithium, and that was pretty much it. And, as it turns out, it's actually quite hard to make stars or any structure from\nthat, that very hot gas. And so the very first stars that formed prior to any galaxies were\nvery massive stars, big stars, 100 times the mass of the sun, and they were made from\njust hydrogen and helium. So big stars explode pretty fast, after a few million years only. That's very short on cosmic time scales. And in their explosions, they provided the first heavier\nelements to the universe because, in their course, all stars fuse lighter elements like hydrogen and helium\ninto heavier ones, and then that goes all the way up to iron. And then all that material gets ejected in these massive supernova explosions. And that marked a really, really important\ntransition in the universe. Because after that first explosion, it was no longer chemically pristine. And that set the stage for\neverything else to happen, including us here talking today. (laughs) - So what do you mean by pristine? So there's a whole complex soup of elements now as opposed to just hydrogen helium and a little bit of lithium. - Yeah, so after the Big Bang,\njust hydrogen and helium. We don't really need to\ntalk too much about lithium because the amount was so small. And after these very first\nstars formed and exploded, the heavier elements like\ncarbon, oxygen, magnesium, iron, all of that stuff was suddenly\npresent in the gas clouds in tiny amounts only,\nonly very tiny amounts. But that actually helped, especially the carbon and the oxygen, to make the gas cool. These atoms are more\ncomplicated than hydrogen, that's just a proton, and so it has cooling properties, can send out photons\noutside of the gas cloud so the gas can cool. And when you have gas that\ngets colder and colder, you can make small and smaller stars, so you can fragment it and clump it and turn it into stars like the sun. And the cool thing about that is that when you have\nsmall stars like the sun, they have a really long lifetime. So those first low-mass\nstars that formed back then are still observable today. That is actually what I do. I try to find these early survivors because they tell us what the\ngas looked like back then. They have preserved that composition of these early gas cloud, the,\nthe chemical compositions, until today. So I don't need to look\nvery far into the universe to study all the beginnings, I can just chemically\nanalyze the oldest stars. And it's like unpacking everything\nthat happened back then. It's very exciting. - So to just reiterate. So in the very early days, in\nthe first few million years, there was giant stars that's\nmostly hydrogen and helium. And then they exploded in\nthese supernova explosions and then they made these clumps- - [Anna] Yeah, so the first stars- - Not pristine. Not pristine clumps? - Yeah, pretty much.\n- Fun. - So it took a few hundred million years for the first stars to emerge and then they exploded\nafter a few million years. Kaboom. And then it's like I always\nconsider the universe like a, you know, a nice soup. And then these first supernova explosions kind of provided the salt, you know, just a little sprinkle\nof heavier elements, and that made it really tasty. (chuckles) It just changed it completely, right? And that changed the physics of the gas. So that meant that these gas\nclouds that were, you know, surrounding the former first stars, they could now cool down and clump and form the next generation of stars that now included also little stars. And, as I just mentioned, the small stars have these\nreally long lifetimes. The sun has a lifetime\nof 10 billion years. Any star that is even less massive will have an even longer lifetime. So that gives us a chance to\nstill observe some of the stars that formed back then. So we are testing the conditions, the chemical and physical conditions, of the early universe even\nbefore the galaxy formed. - So what's the timeline\nthat we're talking about? What is the age of the universe? And what is the earliest\ntime we got those salty, delicious soup, clump soups\nwith heavier elements? - Well, the universe is\n13.8 billion years old. - Allegedly, yeah. Is it? So-\n- Yes. - Okay, 13.8-\n- Well, you know, when I was in high school, the universe was 20 billion years old. - [Lex] Oh, yeah? So the estimate-\n- Things have changed. - Do you think that estimate will evolve in interesting ways or no? Is it pretty stable at this point?\n- I think we have have mostly converged, yes, because the techniques\nare very different now, much more precise. The whole business of precision cosmology by mapping out the cosmic\nmicrowave background, you know, that's a marvelous feat. Maybe, you know, the digits will still\nmove around a little bit, but that's all right. - Plus the gravitational\nwaves and all that, so all the different sources of data kind of mapping out this detailed picture of the early universe. Yeah.\n- Totally. And so we think the earliest\nlittle stars formed, I don't know, maybe 1/2 billion years\nafter the Big Bang, right? Again, a few hundred million years for the first stars to emerge and then, you know, took some time, so give or take 1/2 billion years. And that was the time when sort of the very\nfirst protogalaxies formed, early stellar structures, stellar systems, from which the Milky Way\neventually formed, right? So it was... The Milky Way was probably\na slightly bigger one. And we know today that\ngalaxies grow hierarchically, which means the eat\ntheir smaller neighbors. So if you are the bigger one and have a few friends around, you're just gonna eat them, absorb them, and then you grow bigger. And so all these little\nearly stars, you know, kind of came into the Milky Way through that kind of process, and that's why we find them in the outer parts of the galaxy today, because they're just kind of (indistinct) and just left there since. - So the old stuff is on\nthe outskirts of the galaxy and the new stuff is closer to the middle? Is there-\n- Broadly speaking. - Okay.\n- Yes, yes. - So that's where you would look for it. So maybe just a step back. Like, what is a galaxy? What is a protogalaxy? - I love that question. So the galaxy is a huge assembly of stars. The Milky Way contains something like 200 to 400 billion stars. And most of the material and\nthe stars are in the disc. And when we look at the night sky, what we see as the Milky\nWay band on the sky, that is actually the inner, the next inner spiral arm, because we actually live\nin a spiral disc galaxy. The Milky Way is spiral disc galaxy. And we are looking... Actually it depends a little bit. In the Northern Hemisphere, we're looking out of the galaxy, so we are seeing the\nnext outer spiral arm. And as you can imagine, there's only dark space behind that. So we don't see it all\nthat nice on the sky. But if you travel to\nthe Southern Hemisphere, let's say South America, you see the Milky Way and it\nlooks so different on the sky because that's the next inner spiral arm, and that's back lit by\nthe galactic center. The galactic center is a\nvery big, puffy, you know, region of gas, there's\na lot of star formation. The galactic party is happening there, so it's very bright and it makes for this\nvery beautiful Milky Way on the night sky that we see. So actually if you ever get\nthe chance to experience that, I encourage you to almost\nlike close your eyes while seeing this and\nimagining that you are sitting in this kind of disc, in this pancake, and you're just kind of\nlooking right into it. And you can really feel\nthat we are in this 2D disc. And then you can imagine that\nthere's a top and a bottom and that we're really part of the galaxy. You can really experience that. We're not just lost in space somewhere, but we're really a part of it. And, you know, knowing a little bit about the structure of the Milky Way really helps. - Do you feel small when\nyou think about that, when you look on that spiral on the inside of the Milky Way and then you look out to the outside? Like, how are we supposed to feel? - I don't know. I don't feel small, necessarily. I feel in awe and I feel I'm a part of it because I can really feel\nthat I'm a part of it. I think for many people\nthey think like, oh, there's just the planet\nand then there's nothing, and that's almost a little bit sad. But that's really not the case, right, because there's so much more. And I really like to imagine, \"Wow, I'm sitting in this\nbig galactic merry-go-round and we're going around the center.\" And I can see the center above me, right? And I can almost feel like we're going, going there. (chuckles) Of course we can't really feel that, but the sun does circle\nthe galactic center. - But there's a kind of sadness to... Like looking at pictures\nof a nice vacation place, all we get is that light, an old light. Do you feel, like, sad\nthat we don't get to travel or you and I will not get to travel there and maybe humans will\nnever get to travel there? - Yeah, I always wanted\nto travel into space and see the Earth and\nother things from up there. There's certainly that. But I don't know. It's also okay to just\nbe at our vantage point and see it from here. - With the sensors, with\nthe telescopes that we have, and explore the possibility. I mean, there is a kind of\nwonder to the mystery of it all, what's out there, what interesting things that\nwe can't possibly imagine. You know, there could be all\nkinds of life forms, bacteria, all this kind of stuff. I tend to believe that... You know, it depends on the day. I tend to believe there's just a lot of\nvery primitive organisms just spread out throughout, and they build their little things, like bacteria-type organisms; and just to think what\nkind of worlds there are. 'Cause they're probably really\ncreative living organisms 'cause the conditions... I guess the question\nI'm wondering to myself when I look out there to the stars, how different are the conditions on the different planets\nthat orbit those stars? - It will definitely be very different. I mean, the variety out there is is huge. We know now that... I think it's about every other\nstar has at least one planet. I already mentioned the\nnumber of stars in the galaxy. I mean, you know, it's a huge\nnumber of planets out there. So who knows what that looks like? All we know is that there\nis a lot of variety. We don't quite yet\nunderstand what drives that, what governs that, why that is the case. Why is it not all one size fits all? - Oh, you mean the dynamics\nof planet formation, like exoplanet formation\nor star formation, the whole shebang?\n- All of it, all of it. Star formation remains\na much researched topic. We kind of, we definitely\nknow that it works because all the stars are\nthere, same for the planets, but the details are so\nvaried per gas cloud, right? It's very hard to come up with\nvery detailed prescriptions. Broadly, we have figured it out. You need a gas cloud, you need to cool it, something clumps and fragments and somehow it makes a star\nwith planets or without. - But the dynamics of the clumping process is not fully understood. - No, no. And the local conditions\nare so varied, right? I mean, it's the same with, you know, all people look like people, but individually we look very different. - So even the subtle diversity\nof the formation process creates all kinds of fun differences.\n- Yes. So we just don't know how this turned out in an individual case, and it's kind of hard\nto figure it all out. And to take a look, certainly\nwith planets, right, the chance to ever actually\ntake a picture of a planet is minuscule because they don't shine, so they're really dark. (laughs) So I'd say there's a lot\nof possibility out there, but we have to be a little\nbit more patient before we- - Or come up with technologies where patience becomes less necessary by extending our lifetimes or increasing the speed of space travel, all the kind of stuff. Humans are pretty, pretty intelligent, they're pretty-\n- Sometimes, yeah. - Sometimes sometimes. For the most part, I hope, on the optimistic days. Well, maybe just to linger\non the, what a galaxy is. What should we know about our\nunderstanding of black holes and their formation? Is that an important thing to understand in the formation of a galaxy? Like, so all the orbiting, all the spiraling that's going on, how important is that to understand? - All of the above. That's what makes astronomy really hard but also really interesting, right? No day is like another because\nwe always find something new. I wanna come back to the\nidea of the protogalaxy because that actually\nmatches or, you know, relates to the black hole formation. So most large, well, pretty much all large galaxies have a supermassive\nblack hole in the center. And we don't actually know, we don't really know where they come from. Again, we know that they're there, but how do we get there? So if we go back to the\nearly universe, right? We had a little galaxy that just sort of, you know, I don't know, had some small number of stars. It was the first\ngravitationally bound structure that was held together by dark matter, because dark matter actually\nkind of structured up, you know, first before\nthe luminous matter could because that's what dark\nmatter kind of does, and it started to hold gas and\nthen stars sort of together in these first very shallow, what we call potential wells, so these gravitationally bound systems. And then the mice grew from\nabsorbing neighboring, smaller, even smaller systems. And somewhere in that process there must have been a seed for one of these supermassive black holes. And I'm not actually sure\nthat it's clear right now kind of what was there first, the supermassive black hole or the galaxy. So lots of people are\ntrying to study that. And of course the black hole\nwasn't as massive back then as it is these days, but it's a big area of research. And the new James Webb,\nthe JWST, the telescope, the infrared telescope in\nspace, is working on... Many people are working on that to figure out exactly what happened. And there are some surprising results that we really don't\nunderstand right now, so... - So to solve the chicken\nor the egg problem of: Do you need the supermassive\nblack hole to form a galaxy or does the galaxy naturally create the\nsupermassive black hole? - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think to some\ndegree we can answer that because there are lots of\nlittle dwarf galaxies out there. You know, the Milky Way remains surrounded by many dozens of small dwarf galaxies; I have studied a bunch of them. And to the extent that we can tell, they do not contain black holes. So there certainly were\ngravitationally bound structures, so either you can call them protogalaxies or dwarf galaxies or first galaxies, they were definitely there. But there must have been bigger things, like the proto Milky Way, where something was different, right, what made them more\nmassive so that, you know, they would gravitationally\nattract these smaller systems to integrate them. So we'll have to see. - How do we look into that, into the dynamics of the formation, the evolution of the protogalaxies? Is it possible? Did they shine? I mean, what are the set of data that we can possibly look at? So we've got gravitational waves, which is really insane that\nwe can even detect those. There's light. What else can we- - So that would fall into the category of observational cosmology. And the JWST is the prime\ntelescope right now to... And it promises big steps forward. This is in its early days\nbecause it's only been online like a year or so. But that collects the infrared\nlight from the furthest, like literally protogalaxies, earliest galaxies that light has traveled some 13 billion years to us, and they're observing these\nfaint little blobs. (laughs) And folks are trying to, you\nknow, again, study the early, the onset of these early\nsupermassive black holes, how they shape galaxies. So they're seeing that\nthey were there, you know, surrounded by already bigger galaxies. Ideally I'd like for my colleagues to push a little bit further, hopefully that will\neventually happen. (laughs) - [Lex] In terms of looking towards the older and older ones? - Yeah. Yeah. And more and more sort of primitive in terms of the structure. But, of course, as you can imagine, if you make your system\nsmaller and smaller, it becomes dimmer and dimmer and it's further and further away. So we're reaching the end of the line from a technical\nperspective pretty quickly. - But it's dimmer and dimmer\nmeans older and older? - Yes, in a sense, because\nit all started really small. All right? - [Lex] Because it's smaller and smaller, which correlates to older and older. - In that phase of the universe, it would, otherwise it doesn't, yeah. - Just to take a small\ntangent about black holes, and, you know, because you do quite a bit\nof observational cosmology and maybe experimental astrophysics. What's the difference to you between theoretical\nphysics and experimental? So there's a lot of really\ninteresting explorations about paradoxes around black holes and all this kind of stuff, about black holes destroying information. Do those worlds intermix to you especially when you\nstep away from your work and kind of think about\nthe mystery of it all? - Well, at first glance there\nisn't actually much crosstalk. Personally, I mostly observe stars. So I don't usually actually think too much about black holes. - And stars is a fundamentally kinda chemical physical\nphenomena that doesn't- - That's right. The physics\nis kind of different. It's not extreme. - I mean, you know, you could consider a nuclear fusion sort of be perhaps extreme. You need to tunnel. There's some interesting physics there, but it's a different flavor. I don't do these kinds of\ncalculations myself either. I very much like to talk\nwith my theory colleagues about these things, though, because I find there's always\nan interesting intersection. And often it's just... I've written a number of papers with colleagues who do like\nsimulations about galaxies. And so they're not quite as\nfar removed as, let's say, the black hole, you know,\npen-and-paper folks. But even in those cases, we had the same interests\nin the same topics, but it was almost like we were speaking two different languages. And we weren't even that\nfar removed, you know, both astronomers and all. And it was really interesting\njust to take the time and really try to talk\nto each other. (chuckles) And it's amazing how hard that is. You know, even amongst scientists, we already have trouble\ntalking to each other. Imagine how hard it's to\ntalk to non-scientists and other people to try, you know, to... We are all interested in the same things as humans at the end of the day, right? But everyone has sort of\na different angle about it and different questions and\nway of formulating things. And sometimes it really\ntakes a while to converge and to get, you know,\nto the common ground. But if you take the time, it's so interesting to\nparticipate in that process. And it feels so good\nin the end to say like, \"Yes, we tackled this together,\" right? \"We overcame our differences, not so much in opinion but just in expressing\nourselves about this and how we go about solving a problem.\" And these were some of my\nmost successful papers, and I certainly enjoyed them the most. - And it could also\nlead to big discoveries. I mean, there's a... I think you put it really well in saying that we're all kind of studying the same kind of mysteries and problems. I mean, I see this in the space\nof artificial intelligence. You have a community, maybe\nit seems very far away, artificial intelligence and neuroscience. You know, you would think\nthat they're studying very different things. But one is trying to\nengineer intelligence, and in so doing trying to\nunderstand intelligence. And the other is trying\nto understand intelligence and cognition in the human mind. And they're just doing it\nfrom a different set of data, different set of backgrounds, and the researchers that\ndo that kind of work. And probably the same is true in observational cosmology and simulation. So it's like a fundamentally\ndifferent approach to understanding the universe. For simulation: \"Let me use the things I know to create a bunch of\nparameters and create some, just play with it, play\nwith the universe, play God, create a bunch of universes and see in a way that\nmatches experimental data.\" It's a fun, it's like playing\nSims but at the cosmic level. - [Anna] Yes, yes. (Laughs) - And then probably the set\nof terminology used there is very different. And maybe you're allowed\nto break the rules a little bit more. Let's have... You know, yeah... It's like the Drake equation. Yeah, you don't really know. You kind of come up with a\nbunch of values here and there and just see how it\nevolves and, from that, kind of intuit the\ndifferent possibilities, the dynamics of the evolution\nof a galaxy, for example. Yeah, but it's cool to\nplay between those two. 'Cause it seems like\nwe understand so little about of our cosmos, so it's good to play. - Yes, it's like a big sandbox, right? And everyone kind of\nhas their little corner and they do things, but we we're all in the\nsame sandbox together at the end of the day. - And that sandbox does\nhave super powerful and super expensive telescopes\nthat everybody's also, all the children are\nfighting for the resources to make sure they get to\nask the right questions using that big, cool tool. Well, can we actually\nstep back on the big field of stellar archeology? What is this process? Can you just speak to it again? You've been speaking to it, but what is this process of\narcheology in the cosmos? - Yeah, it's really fascinating. So I mentioned the lesser the mass of the star, the longer it lives. And, again, for reference\nfor the next dinner party, the sun's lifetime is 10 billion years. So if you have a star that's\n0.6 or 0.8 solar masses, then its lifetime is going\nto be 15 to 20 billion years. And that's an important\nrange for our conversation, Because, again, if you assume that such\na small star formed soon after the Big Bang, then it is still observable today. You mentioned old light before, yeah, that light is like a\nfew thousand years old, but compared to the age of\nthese stars it's nothing. So to me, that's young. (chuckles) It comes straight from\na galaxy or, you know, it's not far. These stars are not far away, they're in our galaxy in the outskirts. They probably did not form\nin the galaxy because, again, hierarchical assembly of our Milky Way meant-\n- They were eaten. - Exactly. They formed in a little\nother galaxy in the vicinity and at some point the Milky Way ate that, which means absorbed all the stars, including, you know, these little old stars that are now in the\noutskirts of the Milky Way that I use to point my telescope to. So what can we learn from these stars? Why should we study them? Now, these little stars are really, really efficient with\ntheir energy consumption. They're still burning, for the experts, just burning hydrogen to\nhelium in their cores, and they have done so for the\npast 12, 13 billion years, however old they are. And they're gonna keep doing that for another few billion years; same as the sun. The sun also just does\nhydrogen to helium burning and will continue that for a while. Which means the outer\nparts of the star, well, pretty much actually most of the star, that gas doesn't talk to the core. So whatever composition that\nthat star has, you know, in its outer layers is exactly the same as the gas composition\nfrom which the star formed, which means it has perfectly preserved that information from way back then all the way to today and going forward. So I'm a stellar archeologist because I don't dig in the dirt to find remnants of past\ncivilization and whatnot. I dig for the old stars in the sky because they have\npreserved that information from these first billion years in their outer stellar atmosphere, which is what I'm\nobserving with telescopes. So I'm getting the best look at the chemical composition early on that you could possibly wish for. - What kind of age are\nwe talking about here? Are talking about something\nthat's close to that, you know, like a 13 billion, 12, 13 billion age range?\n- Yeah. That's what we think. Now, there's a small caveat here. We cannot accurately date these stars, but we use a trick to say, \"Oh, these stars must have formed as some of the earliest\ngenerations of stars,\" because we need to talk\nabout the chemical evolution of the universe and the\nMilk Way for a second. So I already mentioned the pristine-ness of the universe\nafter the Big Bang, right, just hydrogen and helium. Then the first stars formed, they produced a sprinkle of\nheavier elements up to iron. Then the next generation of stars formed. That included, again, massive stars that they\nwould explode again, but also the little ones\nthat keep on living, right? And then the massive ones,\nagain, explode as supernova, so they provide, again, another sprinkle of heavier elements. And so over time, all the elements in the periodic\ntable have been built up. There have been other\nprocesses, for example, neutron star mergers and\nother exotic supernovae, that have provided\nelements heavier than iron, all the way up to uranium, from very early on. We're still trying to\nfigure out those details. But I always say pretty\nmuch all the elements were done from like day three. - So iron is where... Like, once you get to iron, you got all the fun you\nneed, most of the fun. - Yes and no. I really like the heavier\nelements, you know, gold, silver, platinum, that kind of stuff. (both laugh) - For personal reasons\nor for star formation? - [Anna] Well, both. (Lex and Anna laughing) - I mean, like, what's the importance\nof these heavier metals in the evolution of the stars? - So they're the spice of life, right? So every supernova gives\nyou elements up to iron. That's cool, but at some point it\ngets a little bit boring because that always works. But that's the baseline; we need that. And that's certainly what\ncame out of the first stars and then all the other supernova\nexplosions that, you know, followed with every generation. And it took about a thousand\ngenerations, give or take, until the sun was made. So the sun formed from a gas cloud that was enriched by\nroughly thousand generations of supernova explosions, and that's why the sun has\nthe chemical composition that it has, including, you know, and somehow the planets where\nwere made from that as well. - So the supernova explosions,\nthe many generations, are creating more and\nmore complex elements. - No, it just goes all the way up to iron. And then it just, it's a little bit more\nof all of these elements. - Just more?\n- Yeah. It's one sprinkle, then another, and it just kind of adds up, right? Now, the heavy elements\nform in very different ways. They're not fusion made. They are made typically through\nneutron-capture processes, but for that you need seed\nnuclei, ideally, you know, iron or carbon or something. So the supernova-made elements are very good seed nuclei\nfor other processes that then create heavy elements. And because they cannot be\nmade everywhere, when... You know, some of my\nstars have huge amounts of these heavy elements in them, and they tell us, in much more detail, something really interesting\nhappened somewhere. - Well, wait. I thought I thought the really\nold ones we would not have. So what does that mean if the old- - Ah, yes, important clarification. So the stars that we are\nobserving today, these old ones, they formed from the gas. And the question is:\nWhat enriched that gas? So it could have been just a first star dumping their elements into\nthat gas all the way up to iron. And we have found some stars that we think are second-generation stars, so they form from gas enriched\nby just one first star. That's super cool. Then we find other old stars that have a much more complicated\nheavy element signature, and that means, okay, they're probably formed in a gas cloud that had a few things going on such as maybe a first star, maybe another more normal supernova, and maybe some kind of special process, like a neutron star merger, that would make heavy elements. And so they created a\nlocal chemical signature from which the next\ngeneration star then informed, and that is what we're observing today. So all these old stars\nbasically carry the signature from all these progenitor events. And it's our job then to unravel, okay, which processes and which\nevents and how many, you know, may have occurred in the early universe that led to exactly that signature that we observe 13 billion years later? - Is it possible to figure out like the number of generations\nthat resulted in these stars? - Well, we can... We think we can sort of say, \"Okay, this was like second\ngeneration or third,\" because the amounts of heavy elements in the stars that we observe is so tiny. One normal supernova explosion is actually already basically too much, it would give us too much of it. And the thing you can\nnever take away things in the universe, you can only add, there's no cosmic vacuum cleaner going around sucking things away. The black holes are probably\nthe closest to that, but they would have taken the whole star. - [Lex] Yeah, they'd take the whole thing, not just a little bit-\n- They wouldn't take stuff out of the gas, you know? So we have maybe 10 stars or so now where we are saying they contained so little of these heavy elements that they must be second generation, because how else would you have made them? And, again, I wanna\nstress that the elements that we observe in these stars were not made by the stars\nthemselves that we observe, that's just a reflection of the gas cloud. So we don't actually... I had to say that 'cause I love stars. At the end of the day, we don't really care for the\nstars that we're observing, we care for the story\nthat they're telling us about the early universe. - Yeah, so the stars are\na kinda small mirror. into the early universe. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - And so what are you\ndetecting about those stars? Can you tell me about the\nprocess of archeology here? Like, what kind of data\ncan we possibly get to tell the story about these\nheavy elements on these stars? - Yeah, it depends really\non what star you find. There are many different\nchemical signatures. We actually pair up, these days, our element signatures with\nalso kinematic information, how the star moves about the galaxy, that actually gives us clues as to where the star might have come from. Because, again, all these\nold stars are in the galaxy, but they're not off the galaxy. That's a small but important distinction. So they all came from somewhere else. - So you can rewind back in time to kind of estimate where it came from. - Yeah. So we can't really say, \"Oh, it came from that\nand that dwarf galaxy.\" But interestingly enough... Just a few days ago I submitted a paper with three women undergrads, it was so good to work together, and we found a sample\nof stars that have very, very low abundances in\nstrontium and barium, so very heavy elements. And I had a hunch for a while that these stars would\nprobably be some of the oldest. Because, as I said, heavy elements give you extra information about special events. And, again, finding\nsomething that's really low means that must have happened either really early on or in a very special environment, right, because we can only ever add. So if you find something\nthat's incredibly low in terms of the abundance, maybe just one event\ncontributed that, max. So we looked at the kinematics: How are these stars moving? And they're all going the\nwrong way in the galaxy. How is that possible? Well, it is possible because consider... Well, now we come back to the protogalaxy. The protogalaxy was like a beehive. It just didn't really know what it was or what it wanted to\nbecome when it grew up and it was absorbing all these\nlittle galaxies to grow fast. Some galaxies, some absorbed galaxies were\nthrown in going the main way and some came in the wrong way, huh? Happens.\n- It happens. - But this could only happen\nearly on when, you know, there wasn't left and\nright and up and down, so stuff would come in from always. So now, 13 billion years later, we're looking-\n- They're still doing it. - Yeah, A they're still doing it. And, B, we just looked for stars that have low strontium\nand barium abundances and then we look at the\nkinematics, and, lo and behold, they're all at hundreds\nof kilometers per second going the wrong way. It's like, \"Dude, you must\nhave come in really early on from somewhere else.\" So we call this retrograde motion. That's a clear sign of accretion, so something that has\ncome into the galaxy. And because they're so fast\nand it's really all of them, that must have happened early on, right? You can't throw a galaxy\ninto the Milky Way right now the wrong way, it eventually will turn around. - Can you actually,\njust on a small tangent, speak to the three women undergrads, like this little... It's pretty cool that you\nwere able to use a hunch to find this really cool little star. Yeah, what's the process like, especially with undergrads? I think that would be very interesting and inspiring to people. - Yes, it was a wonderful\nlittle collaboration that actually emerged in the fall. So I really like working with\nundergrads and, you know, grad students, postdocs. And I came up with a new\nconcept for a class at MIT where I wanted to integrate\nthe research process into the classroom because sometimes people\nfind it really hard to cold email a professor, \"Hey,\" you know, \"I'm this and that person, and I'm interested in your research. Could I possibly, you know, come?\" And I wanted to streamline that and give, and, you know, just trial how it would work to provide sort of the safe\nconfines of a classroom where you just sign up and do research in a very structured way. And I developed, it was a lot of work, a little bit more than I thought, to map up an entire research project basically from scratch in 10 worksheets so that they could do it, again, in a very structured\nand organized fashion. - Oh, so you created this whole framework for them to do it?\n- Yeah, the whole thing. But the promise was, \"You come sign up for my\nclass in teams of two. You each get your own old star that has not been analyzed before. I don't know what the solution is.\" Because in research we\ndon't look up the solution at the end of the book, we do not know what we're going to find, our job is to do the work and then to interpret the numbers because our job as scientists\nis to find the story. Anyone can crunch numbers, anyone. It's complicated sometimes, but it's doable, right?\n- Yes. - But coming up with a story when you only have three puzzle pieces, what does the puzzle look like? You have to be a little bit bold, you need to have some experience, and you need to kinda\nsee the universe in 3D. You just need to kinda go for it. And that's the beautiful thing. I really love that. - And so this was a\nstory of weird kinematics going the wrong way combined with this\nparticular weird signature in terms of the heavy elements. - [Ann] Yeah, exactly. - And you have to come up\nwith a story of all that. - Yes, and so the story\nof that paper is now... Usually I don't say I\nfind the oldest stars. You know, when I talk to\nmy research colleagues, I talk to them about we find the chemically\nmost pristine stars because that's actually what we measure, the chemical abundance\nthat tells us, okay, it must have been second or third or fifth generation of stars, right? But these low strontium stars\nthat go in the wrong way like they're getting paid for it, they must be the oldest stars\nthat came into the galaxy because they formed before the galaxy was\nthe Milky Way, right? And it's so cool and it was so wonderful. So this class, it went\nso well in the fall. I had nine people sign up. That's not unusual for a\nspecialty class at MIT, so a small number. It was eight women. And they were so into it that I said, \"Okay, let's use this opportunity. You're gonna do some extra work with me and we're gonna publish this.\" - Try to publish.\n- Yes. I also like that you're\nusing the terminology of chemically more pristine. When I'm talking to younger people, I'll just say that I'm more\nchemically pristine than them. I like that description of age. So there's this term of metal-poor stars. So most of these old stars\nare going to be metal poor? - [Lex] Yes, I search for\nthe most metal-poor stars. - And what does that... Can we just define what does that mean?\n- Yeah, what does that mean? I don't know who came up with this; I would love to know. But the universe is a complicated place. So many decades ago-\n- That's a good start. - someone clever came\nup with the idea to say, \"Let's simplify things a little bit. Let's call hydrogen X, helium Y, and all the other elements\ncombined metals, Z.\" (Lex and Anna laugh) When I give public talks, I always ask, \"Is there a chemist in the audience?. Let me just tell you, neon is a wonderful metal.\" And they're like, \"Oh, my\ngod, what is she's saying?\" But I'm an astronomer, I'm not a chemist, so I'll get away with it. So if you just roll with it for a moment, all the elements except\nhydrogen and helium are called metals. Now, if we look again at chemical or the concept of chemical evolution, it means more and more\noff all the elements, everything heavier than\nhydrogen and helium, gets produced slowly but surely by different types of source and events. So that's, you know, a\nmonotonously increasing function. And so we look for the stars that have the least amounts\nof heavy elements in them because that means we are going further and further back in\nthis process, in that function, almost all the way to the very beginning. And that is the first stars, right? They started that process. That's why I said it was such\nan important transition phase because things were... We call, you know, the post-Big Bang universe pristine, just hydrogen and helium, and after that the mess started. As soon as you add elements to it, things kinda get a little out of hand. That ends in this beautiful variety that we have everywhere these days. - Yeah, and you're looking\nat the very early days in the introduction of the variety. - Yes, exactly, when it was still a little bit\nmore organizable. (chuckles) But he variety of different types of metal-poor stars we have is stark. Many different types of stars, many patterns we have sort of identified, but there are still crazy ones out there that we're still trying to kind of fit in. - So what kind of stars\nhave been discovered? So you've already, a while ago, helped discover the star HE 1327-2326. Great name.\n- Yes. - And HE 1523-0901. What can you say about these stars and others that have been found? - I love them. They're my baby stars. - What do you call your baby stars? Is there cute names?\n- Well, I'm probably the only one who can, you know, spit out these names without cheating. - [Lex] Are there nicknames?\n- Well, no, that's their names.\n- That's not allowed? Okay.\n- Well, some colleagues at conferences have just called them\nAnna star or Frebel star because they didn't wanna learn\nthe phone number, you know, I get it.\n- The phone number. Yeah. - These numbers are actually based on older sets of\ncoordinates for these stars. So, yes, the minus in the middle means that they're in\nthe Southern Hemisphere. So negative is in the Southern Hemisphere, positive is in the Northern. And then 13 and 15 means\nthey're sort of observable in the middle of the year. - Okay, so it's the do\nwith the observation and where it was observed and that kinda stuff.\n- Yes, yes. But they are very different stars. Both absolutely significant, career defining, actually, for me, but really pushed the envelope\nin very different ways. So HE 1327, the first\none that you mentioned, that was the second\nsecond-generation star that we found. And, you know, usually people say like, \"Oh, the first one is a\nbig one and the rest is... Nobody cares.\" But to us it proved\nthat, yes, we can do it. Because, one, astronomers\nlive in this sort of way of... You know, there are a lot of\nserendipitous discoveries, and that's really great, but we need to show\nthat we can do it again. - [Lex] Mm-hmm, reliably. - Because then we're onto something and it's not just some\nkind of weird quirk. And there are a lot of\nquirks in the universe, but we wanna know: Is is that a real thing? Does that happen regularly? Is there something that we can learn? Is that a piece of the story? And so finding the second one that was even a little bit\nmore extreme than the first one really showed, yes, our\nsearch techniques work, we can find these stars. They provide an important\npart to the story in the sense that if we\nhad more than two stars, and by now we have about 10-ish or so, what do they tell us about the nature of the very first stars? And what we found, again,\nworking with the theorists, of course, who run these\nsupernova models, is that... So actually let me... Before I get into this, these two stars had huge amounts\nof carbon relative to iron. So we usually use iron\nas a reference element for what we call the metallicity, so the overall metal content, the overall amount of\nheavy elements in it. - So that's why it's called\nan iron-deficient star? - That's right. So these stars are\nincredibly iron deficient, which means there must be\nof the second generation, because there was... And interestingly enough,\nthere was this discrepancy. A normal supernovae, until then, we thought would get us\nso much iron, you know, and you would distribute\nthat in the gas cloud and then you would form this little star that we're observing. But the iron abundance that we measured was actually much lower than that. And I already mentioned,\nyou can't take things away. That must mean these\nearly massive Pop III, we call them Population\nIII, the first stars, they must have exploded in a different way than we previously thought. They can't output as much iron because they just can't, (laughs) otherwise it wouldn't\nmatch our observations. - [Lex] Got it. - And so that's when we started to work with several theory groups on supernova yields, so what comes out of- - From explosion of the supernova? - Yes.\n- That's cool, supernova yields. And so this one was\nnot yielding much iron. - Well, we needed to concoct\na theoretical supernova that made less. (chuckles) And it's actually surprisingly difficult. Because you can always add\nmore in the universe, right, but you can't take stuff away. So our Japanese colleagues\nkind of came up with the idea of a fainter supernova that\njust doesn't have a much, has enough oomph, you\nknow, when it explodes, so somehow there's less iron coming out. But at the same time, then these stars showed huge\nover abundances of carbon, you know, 1,000 times more carbon. So how do you now get\n1,000 times more carbon out of these poor first supernovae, right? That was the theoretical challenge. And because we didn't have\njust one star, but two, that really spurred the\nfield to think about: What was the nature of the first stars? How did they explode? What are the implications? Because if they're not as\nluminous and bright and energetic, that has consequences for\nthese early protogalaxies in which, you know, they must have been located\nin terms of, you know, blowing the gas out, let's say, and disrupting the system. So much higher chance\nfor the earlier system to stay intact for longer, right? So there's a whole tail of consequences. And this is what I mean with: We need to find the story, because you do you one thing\nand (mimics explosion), it's like the dominoes, there are consequences everywhere, and sudden you have a\ndifferent universe, right? - What could possibly\nbe a good explanation for something that yields a lot of carbon and doesn't yield a lot of iron? - Well, it's not so much an explanation, more like finding a\nmechanism for what happens in supernovae. And the official term, what was sort of, as I said, cooked up in order to\nexplain the observations... And we have, by the way, found a whole bunch more of these stars, so that holds. And it's called a fallback mechanism. So, actually, during\nthe supernova explosion, a massive black hole emerges. And so some of the material falls back onto the black hole. - Oh boy.\n- So here is a vacuum cleaner now plopped into the middle, right? - [Lex] Like a temporary\none that just cleans up some of the elements?\n- Well, sort of, right? Because if you think of the... We haven't talked about this yet, but if you know what a star looks like, a massive star looks like in its interior before it explodes, you have hydrogen and helium\nstill on the outskirts and then layers of heavier\nand heavier elements all the way up to iron. So you have an iron core in the center. And because you can't get\nany energy out of iron when you wanna fuse to\niron atoms anymore, right, that's when the supernova\nexplodes, occurs really. It's actually an implosion first and then you have a bounce of\nthe sort of neutron star phase that occurs in the process\nand then, you know, star gets disrupted.\n- That is so awesome. - Yeah, it's like this giant, you know, basketball (mimics implosion) and then (mimics explosion) it all goes out.\n- So implosion first, explosion after.\n- Yeah. And so in the process, right, if you make your black\nhole basically big enough, it will suck away some of the iron because that's the closest\nin terms of the layers; you hold onto it, you don't let it escape. And carbon is much further\nout, you let it all go. - Nice.\n- And so- - [Lex'] So that explains\nwhy you can have a big oomph and not much iron yield. - Yes. Yes. - So does explained the HE 1327- - Correct.\n- and others like it? - Yes. So there's a... It's well established now that the lower the iron\nabundance of the stars are, the higher the carbon sort of gets. And carbon is such an interesting\nelement in that regard. If we come back to the formation of the first low-mass stars, right? So we had the hotter gas,\njust hydrogen and helium, that made the first stars, there were hundred solar masses or so because the gas couldn't cool enough, so they were big and puffy. Carbon then, coming from the first stars, probably led to enough\ncooling in these gas clouds that enabled the formation\nof the first low-mass stars. So think about what happened if there wouldn't have been any carbon or the properties of the\ncarbon atom would be different, it would not have cooled the gas in such significant ways, perhaps, there wouldn't be any low-mass stars. We wouldn't be here today, right? And we're carbon based. And so I think carbon is really\nthe most important element in the universe for a variety of reasons, because it just enabled\nthis whole evolution that we are now observing and literally seeing in the sky. And it's really fascinating. - So combined with the fact that you have the iron-deficient, so all of that is probably\nimportant to creating humans. - Yeah. Yeah. We need all the elements. But if you don't have stars,\nyou know, like the sun, small stars, that can\nactually host planets, that have long lifetimes... You need long, long lifetimes if you want\nto have a stable planet and develop humans. - [Lex] So carbon is kind\nof important in many ways. - Yes, yes. - This is perhaps a interesting tangent. If I could just mention that you interviewed Mildred Dresselhaus of \"Carbon Queen: The Remarkable Life of\nthe Nanoscience Pioneer.\" Is there something you could say about the magic of carbon\nand the magic of Millie? (Anna laughs) - Well, Millie was certainly magic. She was a professor at\nMIT for many decades. I met her a number of times. Her photograph actually... A young and an older\nMillie is still on the wall every time I step out of the elevator in one of the buildings, I see it. She pioneered all sorts\nof carbon nano work. So she was a material scientist, very far removed from what\nI do on a daily basis. But, yes, carbon has amazing\nproperties when you study it. And, again, that's indeed another aspect of why carbon is so fascinating, not just in the cosmos\nbut also for us, you know, making us, creating us, in\nthe way that we can use it. It's wonderful. - Do you sometimes think\nabout this chemical evolution in this big philosophical way, that we're the results of\nthat chemical evolution, like we're made of this stuff, like we're made of carbon. - Yes. We're made of star stuff. Carl Sagan got it right. (laughs) - I mean , it's almost\nlike a cliche statement, but it's also a materials, a chemical, a physics statement, that we came from hydrogen and helium and somehow these formations created this interesting\ncomplexity of soup that made us. What are we supposed to make of that? Like, what? Did we just get really lucky? Why do we get all this cool stuff? - [Anna] Yeah, that's a\ngood question. (laughs) - I don't think it's a\nquestion that has an answer. I keep just asking why. But it is just this incredible mystery. So much cool stuff had to happen. So much, sorry, hot stuff had to happen to create us.\n- Well, right. And so much could have gone wrong and there would've been\nanother outcome, you know? And it's actually amazing how many things kind of fell in place. I mean, maybe that's all\nsort of self deterministic in some ways, right? We are who we are because\nthat was the path. (laughs) Maybe we would've ended up\nbeing robots, I don't know. But it's certainly wonderful\nto, you know, as scientists, for us to help contribute unraveling our cosmic history, right? I always say the biological evolution on Earth was, you know, absolutely facilitated\nby the chemical evolution of the universe, right? And one doesn't go without the other, certainly from a human perspective. - That evolution seems to be creating more and more complexity. The kind of interesting\nclumping of cool stuff seems to be accelerating and increasing. And it's hard not to see, as humans, that there's some kind of purpose to it, like a momentum towards\ncomplexity and beauty, you know? - Well, beauty is in the eye\nof the beholder. (laughs) But, yes, everything\ngets more complicated. - But there's also a beauty to the chemically pristine\nuniverse in the early days. - Certainly is, yes. I love the desert with it's nothingness; it has much aesthetics and appeal. - We came from nothing,\nwe'll return to nothing. So what about HE 1523? What's exciting? A red giant star. - [Anna] Yes. - That's another one of your babies. - [Anna] Yes. - 13.2 billion years old. - Yeah. So that one isn't quite as iron\ndeficient as the other one, so probably not a second-generation star, but easily second, third, sorry, third, fourth, fifth or so. We can't really pin it down. But it's also not super important for us. What is important is that that star has a very different chemical composition in the sense that, yes, we have all the elements up to iron there. They have sort of normal ratios, which means kind of the\nsame as most other old stars and not too different from the\nsun, or, at least, you know, different in quantifiable ways. But it has this huge overload\nof very heavy elements. And what was so nice about\nthat star in particular was that I could measure the thorium and the uranium abundance. And, again, that was\nthe second of its kind. But the uranium abundance\ncould be more well determined, so we had a better grasp on that. Now, why are thorium\nand uranium interesting? They are radioactive elements, they decay. Thorium has a half life of\n14 billion years, I believe., and uranium of 4.7, which, you know, to folks and us on Earth\nis a really long time. But those kind of\ntimelines are really good when you wanna explore the\nearly universe. (laughs) So there are two questions\nnow that kind of come to mind. Where do these elements come from? And what do they tell us? Right? And these, as we know, these heavy elements are\nmade in a specific process. It's a neutron-capture process usually referred to as the r-process, for rapid neutron-capture process. We talked about seed nuclei before, right? So we still don't exactly know where this process can occur. So you have, let's say, a\nlone iron atom somewhere, and it is in an environment where you have a strong neutron flux, which means there must be\nlots of neutrons around. And,.again, when we talk about the site, we can surmise and ponder\nwhere that might be the case. But you have this iron atom and you bombard it with neutrons, and you do it incredibly fast. Now, what happens in the process? That iron atom, you know, you collect lots of neutrons, it becomes really big and unstable. So it's a heavy neutron-rich nucleus that wants to decay (laughs) because it's not stable, it's way too big. And so let's say you add\nonly one neutron to it, that would already make it unstable, so it will then... It has a characteristic decay time that's called the beta decay timescale, so it will decay to a stable nucleus. So the neutron will convert to a proton, and that makes it stable. If you now bombard lots and\nlots and lots of neutrons onto that seed nucleus within that timescale of the beta decay, that's how you get to this huge, fat neutron-rich nucleus that\nthen wants to decay, right? So the rapid process, as you have your seed\nnuclei, they get bombarded, you create these really\nheavy neutron-rich nuclei, they're heavier than uranium even. The neutron flux stops and then all these heavy nuclei, they decay and they make\nall these stable isotopes that we know of, all the way up to thorium and uranium. - So that rapid nuclei decay is what creates all the- - Correct. And the whole thing is done\nwithin two seconds. (chuckles) So just to add to the rapid here, (fingers snap) in literally the snapping\nof my hand, it's all there. In my talks, I often, I have this nice simulation\nthat illustrates, you know, this creation of these heavy nuclei. And I always say, \"This is the only\nsimulation you will ever see that's slower than real time.\" Because in astronomy, you know, we show, \"Oh, this is how a galaxy forms,\" 13 billion years in 30 seconds. Really short, right? This is the opposite. Me showing you this, the\nelements are long made. - So where and when does this happen, does this process happen? - So you need the strong neutron flux. - [Lex] That's the\nclumping of the neutrons at the nuclei?\n- Yes, that's right. And so there are not\nthat many options, right? So where do you find lots\nof neutrons in the universe? So it's neutron stars, right? Neutron stars form in\nthe making of supernovae, of the explosions. Okay, so maybe some of this heavy material gets sort of made in the making\nof the supernova explosion and then gets expelled. Or you have neutron stars, so, you know, if the neutron star... I mean, usually that's the\nleftover of the supernova. If you have two from a binary pair... So stars usually actually\nshow up in pairs, and so it's not too unusual to create a pair of neutron stars that will still orbit each other after both of their progenitor\nstars have exploded. And those two neutron stars will orbit each other diligently. But as we know now, thanks to LIGO, the gravitational wave observatory, I mean, we know already that before, but now it's been measured by LIGO, is that these two neutron stars, they will orbit each\nother for like forever, but in the process they will lose energy. So that orbit is what\nwe call the orbit decays and eventually the two\nneutron stars will merge. And that results in an explosive event that has roughly the\nenergy of a supernova, but the process is completely different. And the cool thing is when\nthese two neutron stars collide, they produce a\ngravitational wave signature because neutron stars\nare super dense objects, they're like giant atomic nucleuses. So there's a lot of interesting\nphysics happening already. And so if you basically\nform a super neutron star by smashing two into each other, more interesting physics happens. And that means that there's\nthis ripple sent out, you know, into the space time continuum,\nbasically, you know, the... What do people say? The ripples of space time, you know? It's like you drop a\nrock into water, right, you see the waves coming. So that's exactly what happens when two neutron stars merge. And this is neutrons galore, right? It's really violent to smash\ntwo neutron stars, you know, that are so dense already into each other. And in 2017, one of these events occurred. And the LIGO and Virgo\ngravitational wave observatories, they detected that. And then the astronomers pointed their telescopes in that direction and they indeed observed what we call the\nelectromagnetic counterpart. So there was something seen in the sky that faded over the course of two weeks. And that light curve, that light, was exactly what you get when you create all these heavy neutron-rich\nnuclei in the r-process. And then the neutron flux stops and then it takes about two or three weeks for most of them, of these nuclei, to decay to stability. So we saw, the astronomer saw,. in this\nelectromagnetic counterpart, the nuclear synthesis of\nheavy elements occurring. And that's just awesome.\n- That's amazing. - It's so awesome. - That's electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational\nwaves that were detected with two neutron stars colliding aggressively, violently, to create a super neutron star. And that's where you get all the neutrons and neutron flux somehow. And then the whole shebang, that happens in two seconds and creates a bunch of heavy elements. - So that confirmed that\none of the sites, for sure, for the r-process to occur\nis neutron star mergers. Interestingly enough, I\nhave to mention this here, a year prior, in 2016, my former grad student Alex Ji and I, we discovered a small dwarf galaxy that is currently orbiting the Milky Way, it's called Reticulum II, that was full of ancient\niron-deficient stars that also had a strong signature of these heavy elements\nexactly like HE 1523. We weren't looking for that. I actually wanted to prove that they had really low\nlevels of heavy elements because that's what we had seen in all the other dwarf galaxies. And I was dead set on showing that that is yet the case again and that that is a typical signature of early star formation. We already talked about low\nstrontium and barium abundances in the oldest stars, right? This is what we had seen anecdotally in the ancient dwarf galaxies\nthat are surrounding us. - So that's an ancient dwarf galaxy? That dwarf galaxy has a\nbunch of ancient stars in it. - Yes. Yes. And so now we find Reticulum\nII, and it has these, the stars show the signature of the rapid neutron-capture\nprocess, the r-process. And we are like, \"Okay, these stars are located in\na dwarf galaxy right now. We have environmental information. They're not lost in the galaxy where we don't know where\nthey actually came from. No, we know these stars who\nwere formed in that galaxy because they're still in it.\" And we already deduced from that that it must have been\na neutron star merger that went off in Reticulum\nII at early times that polluted the gas from which all our little stars formed. - Can you speak to what a dwarf galaxy is? Can you speak to what this\nReticulum II dwarf galaxy is that is orbiting the Milk Way galaxy? It's going to be eaten by it, presumably- - It totally is going\nto be eaten. (laughs) I can't tell you exactly when. Yeah, the Milky Way remains surrounded by dozens of small dwarf galaxies. They're collections of stars. Some of them, we call them ultra-faint dwarf galaxies because they now only\ncontain, I don't know, a few thousand stars; very, very faint. - [Lex] But still detectable? - Yes, because they're fairly close. And we detect actual\nindividual stars in them. So I've observed some of the\nfaintest stars, you know, you can possibly observe\nwith current telescopes in these dwarf galaxies\nbecause I was like, \"I need to know what the\nchemical composition is,\" because there are leftovers\nfrom the early universe, right? They did not get eaten. So they're still in their\nnative surroundings. It's like getting the\nlions in the wild, right? I gotta study those and compare to the counterparts that got eaten and are\nnow in the Milky Way. And so I- - So presumably most of those stars, it's not all of those\nstars in that dwarf galaxy that are really ancient. - They're all really ancient, because actually, as it turns out, if you have a small galaxy... There was a process\nearly on in the universe called re-ionization that\nkind of heated up everything. And together with some\nsupernova explosions in an early, shallow,\nyou know, bound system, all these little systems lost their gas. It was sort of blown out or\nit simply evaporated, or both, probably both. And so these systems have been unable to continue to form stars since. So it's the best, for us\nstellar archeologists, that you could hope for, because it's a whole bunch\nof stars still sitting there, it's not just one, it's a whole bunch of them\nstill sitting there ever since. And nothing has, literally nothing has happened to them. They've just been waiting there for us. - So from a stellar\narcheology perspective, what is like juicier more interesting, the old stars in the outskirts\nthat have been eaten, on the outskirts of Milky Way, or the stars in the dwarf galaxies? Of all the things you love about the... You said you love stars, so which do you love\nmore of your children? - Hmm, oh, that's a hard one. I mean, I love them all, of corse. They serve different purposes. The stars in the Milky\nWay, I can get much, much, much better data for them\nbecause they're brighter. They're closer, so they're brighter. And that tickles my fancy. (chuckles) - And they have interesting\nkinematics, presumably. - Yes, and we can get that. And so HE 1523, for example, you know, that one is really bright. Only it's a red giant, so it's intrinsically bright\nand it's fairly close. And so the data I got for\nthat was insanely good and that yielded this uranium detection and thorium detection. I can never get that kind of data for a dwarf galaxy star, so that's a big trade off. But the environmental information that we get along with\nthe basic information about these stars in each\ndwarf galaxy is really, really valuable in establishing,\nyou know, for example, the site information, right? Because the galaxy is still there, so nothing crazy could have happened. So actually to close that loop, probably some heavy elements come out of supernovae here and there, but somehow my theory colleagues tell me that a normal supernova just\ndoesn't have enough oomph to really get an r-process\ngoing and doing it all. - So you need these orbiting supernova. - We need probably the\nneutrons star mergers or we need a special kind of supernova that's maybe extremely massive or heavily rotating or does\nsomething else funny, right, to really kinda get that\nparticular process going. But the normal supernovae\ndon't do it, right, so only a little bit comes out. But you could come along and say like, \"Anna, why don't you just\ntake 100 supernovae together to build up the yield?\" Right?\n- Mm-hmm. - But then I come along and say like, \"Look, this dwarf galaxy\nis still intact today. If you would've plugged in 100 supernovae into this little system early on, it would've blown apart.\" It would have blown apart\npast 5 supernovae or 10. So that's a really important\nconstraint that we have, that these systems are still alive, right? So it helps us to pin down where certain processes\ncould have possibly happened. And so it's just a different\ntype of information that we get. - It'd be amazing if we could talk about the observational aspect of this, the tools of observation. So what telescopes have\nyou used, do you use? And what does the data look like? And I think I've read a\nfew interesting stories about the actual process\nof day-to-day observation, a bunch of probably late nights. - Well, yeah, astronomers\nare doing it all night long, so we have lots of late nights. (laughs) - Can you explain the\nall-night-long aspect of it? - Well, let me start by\nsaying I mostly, these days, use the Magellan Telescopes in Chile. There are 6.5-meter telescope, which means the mirror\ndiameter is 6.5 meter. That's not the largest\nthat there is out there, but it's among the largest. And I use a spectrograph\nbecause I'm a spectroscopist. I don't take pictures. (laughs) And that particular\nspectrograph at that telescope is actually unusually efficient, so it kind of makes up for\nthe fact that the mirror isn't as large, you know, let's say the eight-meter telescopes from the Europeans or so. So I'm very happy with that. - Efficiency meaning? - How many photons get\ncollected sort of per time unit because that's always the limiting factor. Prior to the pandemic, we would travel to Chile\nto do our observations. Those telescopes are the... That's the last observatory where people were sort of supposed to travel there and take their own observations. Most other observatories basically have staff there by now who take the observations for you. - So there's the... Directly the scientists are specifying where to point the telescope and they're sitting there\nand collecting the data, making sure the data is collected well, the cleaning of the data,\nthe offloading of the data, all that kind of stuff? - Yeah, so it's mostly done for them. Obviously that's super\nconvenient, (chuckles) but it also takes away a central part of what the work of an astronomer is, which is data collection, right? We don't have an\nexperiment in the basement where we can go day and night or whenever we please and ask a certain question\nof the apparatus, right? \"Let's turn this knob\nand see what happens. Let's turn that knob up\nand see what happens.\" No, you know, we only have one experiment, which is the universe.. And what we see is what we get. (chuckles) And I think it's so important to take an active role in that. So I really love going to the observatory. I've taken many students\nthere over the years to teach them and to just show them what\nit means to be an astronomer. Because you go to these\nremote mountaintops, and it's such a magical environment. And you wait there, you know, for the sun to go down\nand then you get ready. And you look outside and it's\nsuch a serene environment. It's a little bit out of\nthis world. (chuckles) - You're sitting there. So the sun goes down, it's\nevening, late evening, and what does it look like? What are some of the\nmost magical experiences of that process? - Well, you know, when you're\non top of a mountain... You know, climbers, I guess, get to see that probably otherwise. It's very calm and the\ncolors are so beautiful. And I always become much\ncalmer when I'm there, A, because I'm just there\nfor one purpose only, that's data collection. I can say no to my emails, I can say no to everything\nelse because I'm observing. So there's literally less\ndistractions because, you know, you're just there to do one thing. - And also the emails\nsomehow seem less significant when you're looking up at the stars. - It's just you can afford\nto focus on this one thing, and it just kind of does something to you. It's a little hard to describe. But, you know, if you then fast forward, maybe I can speak a little bit about that. I have done a lot of\nastrophotography there as well, so... And observing faint dwarf\ngalaxy stars, you know, these are like 45 minutes,\n55-minute exposures, so you actually have a lot of time. So I would run outside\nand just lay on the ground under the southern Milky Way; beautiful, right, up, you know, there. And I would just lay there\nlike the snow angel, you know, (Anna laughs) and just stare up there and just kind of let my thoughts sort of pass through\nmy brain and just like, \"I'm one of it,\" right? We talked about this in the beginning. This is when I personally have the feeling that I'm a part of it, I belong here, rather than feeling kind of small. Yes, I'm small, but there are many other small things. And lots of small things\nmake one big whole, right? - And we're part of that big whole. So that's looking at the inner spirals of the Milky Way galaxy. - And just, you know, this\ndark sky with the bright stars. And I have described this\nin my book years ago. If the Milky Way is all bright above you, you don't need a moon or anything, you can walk in the starlight\nand you will find your way. There are no trees there\nfor safety reasons, but you wouldn't even\nrun into a tree, right? I mean, you can see... You can almost see the shadow, you know, from the starlight because\nit's such a dark site and the stars are so bright. And these are kind of moments that kind of change you a little bit. And it's-\n- You see the unity of it all. - Yeah, and it's just you and nature. And, you know, with modern\ncivilization and all of that, I think we often try a little bit too hard to be removed from nature, you know, to be independent of it\nand figuring it all out; but at the end of the day,\nwe're just a part of it. And that really helps me\nto remember that, you know, we're one and the same. - Well, that fills me with hope that... 'Cause I tend to think of us humans as in the very early days\nof whatever the heck we are. And so that makes me think\nthousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years from now, that we'll be reaching... Whatever we become will\nbe traveling out there to explore more and more and more. So what you're doing is the\nearly days of exploration with the tools we have. - Yes, the early seafarers\nlooking at the sky for navigation. (laughs) - Coming up with different theories of what's on the other\nside, that the Earth, starting to gain an intuition\nthat the Earth may be around and that we might be able to\nnavigate all the way around to get to the financial benefits of getting spices from India\nor whatever the reason, whatever the grant funding\nprocess is all about. But ultimately it actually results in a deep understanding of the\nmystery that's all around us. And, I mean, just to travel out there... I mean, to me, the discovery\nof life in the solar system, I really hope to see that in my lifetime, some kind of life, bacteria,\nsomething, maybe dead, because that means\nthere's life everywhere, and that's just the kind of stuff that might be out there, all the different\nenvironmental conditions, chemically speaking, that are out there. And it just seems like\nwhen you look at Earth, life finds a way to survive, to thrive, in whatever conditions. And so maybe that process\njust kinda humbles you. And it's super exciting to know\nthat there is life out there of different forms. And of course that raises the question of: What is life even? We tend to have a very\nhuman-centric perspective of what is a living organism and what is intelligence and\nall these kinds of stuff. And all the work in\nartificial intelligence now is starting to challenge our ideas of what makes human beings special. And I think we're doing that\nthrough all kinds of ways, and I think you're working\nsome part doing that as well. Like, the unity you feel is realizing we're part of this big\nmechanism of nature, whatever that is, that's creating all kinds of\ncool stuff from the humble, pristine origins to today. So what is... If you could just kinda linger\non the process of the data, what does the data look like? And how does the raw\ndata lead to a discovery of an ancient star? - Well, as a spectroscopist, we have to, I guess, talk for a brief moment\nabout what a spectrum is. Everyone, I hope, has\nseen a rainbow in the sky. That is basically what we're doing. We don't send the starlight\nthrough a raindrop that then gets bounced around and splits up the light\ninto the rainbow colors, we do it with a spectrograph, so basically a prism. So we send the starlight\nthrough a prism of sorts and that splits it up and\nthen we record exactly that. So it's a little 2D picture\nactually of a spectrum. Now, it's not gonna look\ncolorful, just black and white. Different colors have, of\ncourse, different energies, that's what we record. More specifically, we\nrecord as wavelengths. So wavelengths and frequency and energy, it's all the same at the end of the day. We process that little image in a sense that we do a cross cut and then sum up a few columns so that we get all the\ndata that we recorded. And what we see is a, (laughs) it's a bit funny to\ndescribe just with words, but a wriggly line with lots of dips. So the 2D process spectrum,\nwe call it continuum, so it's just a flat line, basically, and then there are dips. So the interesting things are the dips. If you think back of the rainbow, what we actually see in our\nstars is not just a rainbow, but it would be a rainbow with\nlots of black lines in it, which means certain little pieces of color have been eaten away by a certain amount and so we can no longer see\nit as well or not at all. Why is that happening? So if we come back to our stars, what we're observing, we're observing the stellar surface. We can actually never peer\nwith our telescopes inside, we only ever can go after the surface. And the surface contains, or the surface layer contains\ndifferent kinds of elements. Every one of those types of atoms, so elements are just\ndifferent types of atoms, they absorb different photons that are coming from the hot core where the fusion is occurring. And so that means that if you\nare the observer, you know, with a spectrograph or without, you will see the starlight. But certain frequencies, certain energies of that\nlight will have been absorbed by all the different atoms in the gas, so you see less of them. And so those are the dips. And the strength of the\ndips tell us, you know, which element was it and\nhow much of that element was or is in the star. So we have many, many, many dips. The solar spectrum, for\nreference, you know, all the dips are overlapping because the abundance of\nall the elements is so high, it's actually very complicated spectrum. My spectra really look\nlike a straight line and then there's a dip here and then you have the straight line, again there's a dip there. The sun doesn't have\nstraight lines, I mean, it's just all absorbed\nin some form or another. But the old stars have so\nlittle of all the elements that only occasionally these\ndips that then indicate, \"Okay, that one at that\nwavelength was iron. And here we have carbon, and\nthere's magnesium, and sodium. And, oh, there's a little\nstrontium line here.\" So we have a much easier\nway to map out this barcode that the spectrum, you know, pretty much is at the end of the day and to then measure the strength of these, we call it absorption\nlines, to then calculate, with existing codes that mimic the physics of the sellar atmospheres, like how much was absorbed, how many, what kind of elements were present in the stellar atmosphere. And so this is how we get to\nour abundance measurements and then altogether that gives\nus the chemical composition and that particular\nsignature in that star. - Do you ever look at\nlike the raw spectrograph and the absorption line\nand your able to see, intuit some interesting, non-standard outlier kind of patterns? Or does this have to do\nheavy amount of processing? - We actually process our... It's fairly straightforward\nto do our processing. We do it at the telescope. So I often take a shorter exposure first, let's say 10 or 15 minutes. So mostly when I do discovery work, we would just take a quick-look spectrum, then we process it while\nwe observe the next star, then we take a quick look. We have what I call the summary plot. It's a collection of little\nareas in the spectrum that have the key positions, the positions of the key elements in it. And it's kinda like reading\nthe tea leaves. (laughs) I have stared at so many spectra, I just need to know, I just need to see our summary plot and I can tell you exactly what the numbers are going to be. - And also to tell if\nit's going to be promising to look at further?\n- Yes, exactly. And so it's thumbs up,\nthumbs down. (laughs) Are you worth my time or not? In most cases, it's not. Or it's good enough, we\ncan do a basic analysis, maybe publish this as\npart of a larger sample, just so, you know, we output that we have observed the star and their basic nature. That's an important\npart to publish as well. And, yeah, I had a run... So now we do remote observing. I do all of this now from my\nhome, from my living room, all night long. (laughs) And I often work with colleagues. So we do it over Zoom\nand we process the data, we look at it, same thing still. And we just found a star that\nhad a very low iron abundance and then we decided, \"Okay,\nthat looks interesting. We're just gonna keep exposing.\" So we took more data on it on the spot and we're writing up the paper right now. - How do you know where\nto point the telescope? - It's not random. There's a lot of work that goes into that. I began my career by trying\nto answer that question, as in like doing the search process. That's why I called my book, that I've written some time ago, \"Searching for the Oldest Stars,\" because searching is one thing,\nit's very time consuming. And then on top of that,\nnot everyone finds, right? And I often don't find, but I keep searching because, you know, our techniques have established that, yes, we can do it if we're just patient enough and keep going because\nit's a numbers game. And that's often the case in science. And that's something that... Not enough is talked\nabout how tedious it is and how long it takes to get\nto that one discovery, right, that moves the field further. - And how difficult it is to believe that there is a thing to be discovered. - Yes, yes. We have this saying, I learned this, I think,\nfrom my supervisor, \"One star is a discovery, two is a sample, and three is a population.\" So as soon as you found three\nof roughly the same kind, you are done, but you need to get there. (chuckles) - [Lex] Yeah. Probably the\nfirst is the hardest, right? - Yes. But it kind of remains really hard. But the thing is then at past three, many of us are like, \"Okay,\nwe've solved that problem. We've shown it three\ntimes, so we can do it.\" That's a thing, right? That's a population. Three iron-deficient\nstars, let's say, right, that's one puzzle piece, now we can move on to the next thing. - That's an indicator that\nthere's many more of them, potentially.\n- Yes, yes, yes. So to cut a long story\nshort about the searching, we started early on with what's called\nlow-resolution spectroscopy of many stars. So, for example, my thesis\nwork, almost 20 years ago, was piggybacking off a quasar survey that had collected. So quasars are basically\ngiant supermassive black holes that are really far away. So you only see a one\nbig bright light point. So it looks like a star, but it's actually just a\ngiant supermassive black hole that out shines its own galaxy. And people have been trying to study those and they had taken little\nspectra of, you know, all things in the sky. And it turns out, oh, you can fish out the\nactual stars from that and look for certain signatures that might indicate low-metallicity stars, so stars with low abundances. And so it was painstaking work to then take\nmedium-resolution spectroscopy to get a little bit more information and to use approximations\nand to kind of get candidates that we can then eventually take to the big glass like Magellan to get a high resolution spectrum so we really see the dips of\nall the individual elements that then give us a final answer: Is it yay or a nay? (chuckles) These days, with another grad student, I developed a new technique to use images actually of\nall the stars in the sky taken with very narrow filters. So it's like you're wearing\nvery specific glasses that only lets so much light through. And so we can do similar things through having several\nnarrow-band filters, what we call it, to fish out things that have, you know, no absorption over here,\nso just the straight line, and then a little dip here,\nso a little something there. And that has proven fairly\nsuccessful in recent years. - So looking at the entire, looking at broader regions of space? - That's right. Because these stars are a little bit like the needle in the haystack, right? There are not that many left over. And certainly the galaxy has made plenty of stars in between; we need to comb through all\nof those to get to the goods. So we always start with millions\nand then work our way down, and in the end we have\nlike three good candidates. - I wonder how those ancient stars feel that they were noticed. They probably know that\nnobody pays attention. No, I'm just kidding.\n- We're all special, right? So are the stars. - It's good, it's inspiring, even if you're the outcast. In your pristine nature, you still might nevertheless be noticed. I'm hoping the same about humans, if somebody's observing us. Is there something else you could say that's about the challenges of this kind of high-precision measurement that you're doing, so this kind of collection\nof data, looking, trying to kinda pull out the signal from the noise out there? - Well, that's literally what we are doing in multiple ways actually. So we're trying to find\na needle in the haystack and then we find something and then it turns out it's\njust a little bit too faint to actually get the kind\nof data quality on it that we would like or that would be warranted given the potential of the star, right? It's like (groans). - So there's always noise, there's always a little bit of noise, and you have to try to say like, yeah, \"How special is this,\" when you're looking at\nthe absorption line? How-\n- Yeah. So the most iron-poor stars, their iron lines are so tiny that they're literally, you\nknow, almost in the noise. So you need incredibly good\ndata to make detections. And the funny thing is we're looking for the nothingness of,\nlet's say, the iron lines, but then we don't want nothing because if there's\nnothing in the spectrum, we can't measure anything, we can only get an upper limit. But we'd really like a measurement. So we are looking for the last little bit that you could possibly detect, and that's a strong function\nof the brightness of the star because the telescopes have\nthe size that they do that, that's not gonna change for a while; hopefully eventually it will, but it's gonna be at least 10 years out. And so, yes, we're often literally stuck in the noise because we can't make the measurement. So actually the record holder for the most iron-poor star\nonly has an upper limit. We can't get enough data on this to actually pinpoint a measurement to then take it to our theory\ncolleagues and say like, \"Give me this little iron\nout of your first star.\" (Anna laughs) So it's a bit frustrating, but also super exciting at the same time. - So let's go to both\nside of that spectrum. What's like the most exciting\ndiscovery to you personally? Is there a moment you remember\nthat you saw a piece of data and you kind of, your heart skipped a bit? - Yeah, yeah, of course. - Is it HE 1327? - That was definitely\none of those moments. I wasn't actually\npresent at the telescope, but we were sent the data\nimmediately from our colleague. And we just looked at it and our eyes got really wide and was like, \"Oh, my god. (laughs) Is this really what we think it is?\" So we had to run some numbers and it was. And these are magical little moments. The thing is, you know, often\nwe have false positives. And so there's always this kind of period, and often it's, I don't know, 10, 15 minutes where you\nneed to make some tests to kind of make the decision: \"Is this really something I\nshould keep observing now? Is this really as good as I think or am I being fooled by something?\" Right? So, actually, if you take a\nspectrum of a white dwarf... A white dwarf is the leftover core of a star like the sun\nthat has gone extinct. And white dwarfs have lost\nall their a outer atmosphere, so it's just a hydrogen and helium core. So they look like a metal-poor style because there's only\nhydrogen helium left, right? But the hydrogen lines that\nyou can see in the spectrum of our stars and of the white dwarfs are a little bit wider than normal. So you need to have a good\neye just to check, you know, \"Does this look a little\nbit wider than it does? Is this a white dwarf\nwho's fooling me here?\" Right? And so it's like this moment,\nit's like, \"Oh, my god.\" - [Lex] It's just minutes of nervousness. - Yes. Yes. And sometimes, you know, it's a dud and sometimes it's not. - What's been a big, that\nyou remember, heartbreak, like a painful low point? Is it all leading up to\nthe first... (laughs) Is it all about HE 1327 again, just the leading up to it? Or has there been like a... Yeah, has there been like\nlow points in the search? - That's a good question. I mean, you know, it starts with mundane things as in like you won your telescope time, you traveled there, and the weather is\ncompletely cloudy, it rains, and you had three nights, which is a lot, and you go home empty-handed. So that's definitely a low point. (laughs) Probably not what you were thinking of, but there is a certain\noccupational hazard to it. - Which requires a kinda\nresilience and a patience. - Yeah. And you just gotta\nlearn to live with it. Coming back to Reticulum\nII, actually, you know, that little dwarf galaxy, that was a run that we had and the weather was incredibly bad. And I had sent my student there. And I was at home, and he calls me at 2:00\nAM and he was like, \"Anna, I think I observed the wrong star. I'm so sorry. There is this line there,\nthis europium line, and it looks like a metal-rich star.\" And I was like, \"It's cool. We all make mistakes. Send me the data, send\nme that summary plot.\" And so I look at it, you know, I was like super tired, and it's like, \"I can't really tell. It doesn't look wrong, but I can't tell you right\nnow that it's right either.\" So why don't you go to the next target? And he calls me back an hour later, \"Anna, it looks just the same. What am I supposed to do?\" And then I joked, \"Well, maybe\nwe found an r-process galaxy. Let's go to the next one.\" And the weather was degrading. And so to cut a long story\nshort, we had to come... So he was observing the right stars. It was an r-process galaxy, the first one we had ever discovered. Totally, I mean, unpredicted. We had no idea that this was a thing. I mean, you know, of course\nwe thought that, you know, such a thing might possibly\nexist because why not, right? Neutron star mergers happen somewhere, crazy supernovae probably too. But we were not prepared in\nthat moment to find this thing. And in the end, the weather\nwas getting worse and worse. And we wanted to see\nhow many r-process stars are in this galaxy. So we managed, by a hairline, to observe the nine brightest stars, but the data quality was atrocious. - [Lex] And the weather\naffects the data quality? - Yes, absolutely. Because these were really faint stars. And so we were really lucky by making a very tight strategy of getting the absolute bare\nminimum for all the stars so we could at least\ntake a very crude look: \"Is it a yay or it's a nay?\" We couldn't even say yes or no, just to get an idea\nbecause we needed to know. Why was that important? Because we could only\nobserve this system again nine months later. - [Lex] So there's always\na window of observation. - Yes, it was setting. This was our chance. And it was going away\nwith the clouds, you know? - [Lex] That was super high stakes. - But we just made it, like, really, it was almost impossible. And it was just... The thing is... This is such a serendipitous moment in a serendipitous moment. The enhancement of these\nheavy elements was so strong that even in this really crappy data, we could still see the enhancement, right? The absorption was so strong that it stuck out of the noise. If the enhancement wouldn't\nhave been as strong, we would not have been\nable to say anything because we wouldn't\nhave been able to tell. But because it was so extreme, it lend us a hand, despite\nthe weather and all, to say like, \"Yes, this is it.\" So that was quite the night. (laughs) - Luck. I mean, a lot\nof this is just luck. So that was the first\nr-process galaxy discovered? - Yes. I didn't sleep all that\nmuch that night. (laughs) - Do you have hope... Are you excited about\nJames Webb Space Telescope and other telescopes in the future that increase the resolution and the precision of what\ncan be detected out there? - Absolutely. JWST is fantastic already. I am not planning to use it personally, although I think I'm on one or two observing proposals actually. Because similar to what\nwe already spoke about, we're interested in the same thing, we are just kind of looking at different sides of the fence, right? I have my old surviving stars and I concoct these little stories about what the earliest\ngalaxies may have looked like, what the objects were that\ncontributed, you know, energy and elements and all these things. And my JWST colleagues, they try to detect some\nof these earliest photons from these earliest systems to look at the energetics\nand other things, you know, what was there, how many, these kinds of things, right? So together we're trying to explore this first billion years, but we do it in very complimentary ways. And so I'm very excited to\nsee what they can come up with and how that helps me to\ninform my stories better and more comprehensively. - What do you think is the future of the field of stellar archeology? How much can we... Maybe what are the limits\nof our understanding of this first billion\nyears of our universe? - Well, obviously lots of limitations in the sense that I always say, \"I have a metal-poor star\nfor any of your questions,\" because there are so many\ndifferent kinds out there. And we still find new\npatterns sometimes, right, and there needs to be an explanation. The question is: Is it ultimately just one quirky star or is it two or it three? Right? Is it a sample? Is it a population? So we haven't concluded\nthat kind of work yet. - So every metal-poor star\nis a kind of data point that you can use to improve\nthe quality of your model of the evolution of the early universe. - Yes, yes. And I would say we've made huge progress over the last 20 years. When I joined that field, it was in its infancy and there was this serendipitous discovery of that first second-generation star. And we have filled in the\ncanvas a great deal since then. And this is what I have\ngreatly enjoyed about doing so because there was so\nmuch discovery potential. And it's been dying down a little bit because of all the progress. It's on the up and coming again because there's so many\nlarge spectroscopic surveys in the works now that will just provide a\ndifferent level of data that we haven't had before. I'm sort of this of older generation. I have only very few colleagues,\nI work in small teams, and I observe every single\nstar myself that, you know... Whatever I can, I do myself. I don't generally take\nother people's data, at least certainly not in the end stage. And, you know, I'm not a\nbig data kind of person, although we're all headed that way. I certainly use data from the\nGaia astrometric satellite for the kinematics, for example. But that's personally a new thing for me to use sort of big-sky\nsurveys that are available. So it's still very sort of\nhand-grown field, you know, where we do our individual observations. I have enjoyed that a lot, but that's about to change. - So one star at a time.\n- Yes. - I mean, there's power to that, to build up intuition of\nthe absolutely universe by looking one star at a time. - Yeah. And this is how you can really drill down on the questions that you have, right, because you control what data you get, otherwise you have the\ndata that you have, right, you get what you get\nand you don't get upset. (Anna laughs) I don't like that. I'm a little bit snobby. I really like to formulate my questions, go to the telescope, and then come what may\nI will try to get it. - And also develop the intuition of where the data can be\nrelied upon and where it can't, and all the different quirks of the data and all that kind of stuff. - Sometimes a lot is lost in the aggregation of the noisy data. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And there always the danger, if you have someone else's data, that you just don't really\nunderstand, you know, the limitations, completeness things, how certain things were set up. And, you know, you get\nout what you put in, so I'm really particular about that. And it's certainly paid off for me. That's one of the main notions that I try to teach in my\nclasses and to my students, that you need to be able to formulate your question really well because otherwise you're\ngonna get an answer to a different question but you won't notice that the goalpost has shifted in the meantime, right? So your interpretation can only\nbe as good as the question. If you need to change your\nquestion, that's cool, do it, but then, you know, it needs to pair up with\nyour interpretation again. And so knowing, really being in the know about\nevery step of what happens, that leads to quality results, I think. That's why I have sometimes little trouble with sort of big data\nand statistical analysis. Yes, on average, that's true, I'm not debating that. But I'm the kind of person, I like to look at the outliers, so not the bulk, but, you\nknow, the special ones, and they just need to be\ntreated in a different way. And there needs to be an\nacknowledgement of that; different ways for different things. - So big data can look at divorce rates, and perhaps you and I are more interested in the individual love stories. - Yes. (Lex and Anna laughing) That works for me. - So I don't know if it's possible to say, but where do you think\nis the big discoveries that are waiting? Is it on the different\ndynamics of the yield, the common narrative, the common story of how some\nof these metal-poor stars are formed? Where are the discoveries in this field that you think will come? - I think the individual\ndiscoveries are actually... We've made most of those, certainly through individual stars. Finding yet another second-generation star is incredibly important for me but isn't really going to move the needle. Finding 50 of them or 100 of them, that would move the needle; but that's in order or two magnitudes up. And new search techniques and new surveys may enable that. But would you still call that a discovery? Right? - [Lex] So that's just a scale, that's a scale-\n- Yes. So I think about it more\nlike literally of the puzzle. Let's say you have a thousand-piece\npuzzle and, you know, you have 900 pieces in there. If you are a person like me, I wanna get to the last ones. I'm not gonna leave it just like, \"Okay, I see broadly what this\nis gonna look like,\" right? \"I'm done now.\" No, I wanna get to the last one. So is the picture\nglobally going to change? No. Are we gonna figure out all the details and how it really works? Yes, right? - So really careful, detailed map out-\n- Getting into it. - the ancient stars of our universe. - Yeah, because I think that's what... Many of the scientists are a\nlittle bit detailed obsessed. But I think that's our job too, right, to really kind of make it airtight, to really walk away saying,\n\"I fully understand this,\" not just broadly, but,\nyou know, I really know, we really know now. And so more and more of\nthat is going to happen. And so I think this is\nprobably true across astronomy, these individual 10-sigma\ndiscoveries become less and less. If they were easy, we would've\nmade them already, right? Which means we have made many of them. But really filling in the details is the next sort of level of discovery? Maybe we need to find a new word for that. The hopes and expectations that go along with the word\ndiscovery are so enormous. We may not always be\nable to live up to that. But it doesn't mean that we're\nnot finding out new things, it's just a different kind of quality because the questions have shifted. You close one door, suddenly there are 10 new open doors that we wanna explore and march through. And that's the, you know, finding these last puzzle\npieces here and there that really make it airtight. - And so there's a lot of value and a lot of power and\nbeauty to the discovery in the big picture of our\nuniverse and in the details. So both are really important.\n- Yes, we need both. Absolutely. - Perhaps drifting into the philosophical, let me ask about the Big Bang as we kinda encroach onto it. So your work is kind of taking\nsteps back through time, in a weird way. Do you think we'll get to\ndeeper and deeper understand the really, really early\ndays of the Big Bang? And the philosophical question: Do you think we'll be able to understand what was before the Big Bang or why the Big Bang happened? Do you think about that stuff? - Not with stars, for better or for worse, because, you know, stars only probe the time\nwhen they were formed, and the Big Bang is surely before then. I mean, I often talk to my students about the difference\nbetween math and physics. Let me give you an example. We talked earlier about\nHE 1523, and, you know, I was happy to share with you that I measured thorium and uranium, but I actually didn't\nquite close that loop. So we did this to try to attempt to calculate an age\nfor these stars, right? But they rely on us knowing\nhow the r-process works, how these elements are\ncreated, where it happens, and then how those elements get dispersed into the gas and end up in\nthe next generation star. So quite a few question marks. So that's how we got to the\nage of 13.2 billion years. This is probably not accurate, but this is the best\ncalculation we could do. And the reason why I'm bringing this up is that that was actually the average of multiple elemental ratios\nthat each gave a certain age, and then we averaged that, because, for better or for worse, this is the best we can do. So some of these numbers said, \"Oh, this star is 15 billion years old,\" and then others said, \"Oh,\nthis is 10 billion years old.\" And so I often use that\nin my class to say like, \"What's the good news and\nwhat's the bad news here? Some ratios say 15 some 10, right? Is 15 correct.\" And then I ask them and some\npeople will say something. And so the thing here is that it's an absolutely\ncorrect calculation given the mathematical and physical model that we constructed, but does it make sense? No, it doesn't. If we believe the universe\nis 13.8 billion years old, 15 is ridiculous, yet it is correct. Isn't that interesting? - [Lex] Correct from a\nmathematics perspective. - Yes, it is not incorrect because this is what I calculated. Nobody made a mistake. Now, we can question\nwhether that's a good model, but that's a separate issue. - So you're saying physicists\nare much closer to truth than mathematicians? - Well, it depends.\n- I'm just kidding. - Sometimes yes and sometimes no, right? So what our job as physicists is, is to take the mathematical\nmodel, calculate our numbers, and then ask the question,\n\"Does this make sense?\" right? Now, in the case of 15 it doesn't. But we took the average anyway because that was the\nbest we could do, right? So, all right, let's put that aside. Let's apply the same sort of thinking to the Big Bang, right? Math can tell us things that\nwe as physicists cannot grasp because it doesn't make sense to us. Now, in the case of the Big Bang, that's a special case because\nwe don't actually know what's supposed to make sense. (laughs) And this is where things get interesting, but this is where math will\nultimately be the winner because we can no longer\nsay this makes sense or this doesn't make sense because the physics is broken down. - But math breaks down too\nat the singularity of things. - Well-\n- Or no. - depending on who you ask. - [Lex] Okay. Sure, sure. - This is the current question, right? How much further can we\npush math, let's say, to the front of the Big Bang? If there is such a thing. - What's the front and the back? What's the front? The front is the-\n- Well, before the Big Bang. - Oh, before the Big Bang? The front, okay. (Anna laughs) Just to clarify all the\ndoorways and the entrances. - So how far can we let the math go before that stops to make sense, right? And I don't know what\nthe answer is to that, but it's really cool\nbecause math doesn't have, is not limited by our physical nature, it can probably go a little\nbit further than the physics. - Yeah.\n- Right? - And math can go into more dimensions than four dimensions comfortably. - And it's judgment free because it just calculates\nthings on its own, whereas, as physicists,\nwe are so judgmental: \"This makes sense. This doesn't make sense,\" right? It doesn't get any worse. - It's such a beautiful dance. It's so amazing that through this dance you can explore the\norigins of the universe. Like, doesn't the Big\nBang just blow your mind, that this thing just started from a point and now we're here? - [Anna] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Hydrogen and helium and then all the stuff you're studying. I mean, this evolution of chemistry created humans and we're here talking. And here's a lot more to the story. It's amazing. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And this kind of march that you're doing is observing data. And is there... You're looking at old light and old data. - But only a few thousand years, right? - [Lex] Just a few thousand years. - That's the difference between\nme and my JWST colleagues. Their objects, that light has traveled 13 billion years, or whatever it was, to us, and they're observing that now. My light has only traveled\na few thousand years It's nothing. - So whatever you observe now is likely still going on. - Yes. These stars are alive and\nkicking and having a blast. - A thousand years, just a few thousand years is all it takes. If we can travel close\nto the speed of light maybe we can reach out there. - We wouldn't have any planets\naround those stars, though. - Is that a definitive intuition? - Well, what a planets made of? Elements, right? Take the Earth, it has all heavy elements, right? The universe needed to\nreach a certain stage first to have produced enough\nof all these elements to actually make a planet. - So on average you're... So, okay, right.\n- So that took quite a few billion years. - So they're not going to have a mechanism for forming planets. You could have visitors probably, but the kinematics of that\nare weird, are unlikely. - Yeah, I would say so. - Okay. So they're interesting in that they reveal the early chemical\nevolution of the universe? - [Anna] Yes. - Not that they're... They could be good\nvacation spots, but not... Well, if you like it warm. (laughs) Just no planet islands to go to to chill. - In your book, you highlight the major contributions in the field by many women. Some of these women were\nnot, as you describe, immediately credited\nfor their discoveries. So for me, from a computer\nscience perspective, the story you also tell\nis Harvard Computers. Who were these women? And what can you just say about the nature of science and humanity? - Discovering things is part\nof the human nature, right? And so it's happened for the longest time, not just by men but also\nby many women. (laughs) The field of stellar\nastronomy, which is my field, has particularly benefited from many discoveries made by women. You mentioned the Harvard Computers, that's a term used for women who worked about 100 years ago at the Harvard College Observatory. And they were hired for their low wages and willingness to do\ndiligent and patient work to comb through the big data of the day. So the observatory director, they were carrying out large\nsky service at the time, and they needed, that data needed to be processed and looked at and analyzed. And so many women, or several dozens, or, well, one or two dozen women over the years, were hired to do this work. And in the process, because they were looking\nat the actual data and they were smart, even though they had\noften no formal education, they made a lot of discoveries simply by being in tune\nwith what they were doing. So they weren't robots as, you know, the term computer would perhaps lead on. So Annie Jump Cannon classified thousands\nand thousands of spectra and found out that you can, you know, stars have different temperatures and their spectra look according. We still use that\nclassification sequence today. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin,\nlater on in, I think, 1925, was one of the first women to obtain a PhD in stellar astronomy. And she figured out, she calculated that the sun is mostly made of hydrogen and helium. That seems normal to\nmany of us these days, but at the time it was\nthought that celestial objects are made of the same thing as the Earth. - That's a gutsy, amazing discovery. - Yes. It was later termed the most\nimportant thesis of humankind or something like that. (laughs) What a revelation to realize that stars are made of\nhydrogen and helium, right? And this was exactly the time when people figured out\nwhy stars are shining, namely because of nuclear fusion and that it's protons and, you know, the tunneling effect that\nleads to the actual fusion, otherwise, you know, the protons repulse each other, they don't come together. And so what an incredible\ntime it was back then. And so stars and nuclear physics\nwere very closely related, and it remains, now it's called nuclear astrophysics. And so many women had many\ncontributions to that. Of course prior to that Marie Curie discovered two new elements. Ah, so awesome. (laughs) Radium and polonium. Lise Meitner discovered nuclear fission, that is the basis for\nunderstanding the r-process. This is exactly what\nhappens in the r-process. You know, the heavy\nnuclei, let's say uranium, if you bombard it with a neutron, we talked at length about\nit, it will decay... Well, not decay, actually. It will fission, it will split into barium\nand krypton, let's say, so two lighter elements. That's exactly what we observe. I have always a higher abundance of barium than the heavier elements\nbecause of this fission cycling that she calculated in 1938, 1939. So, many, many contributions. And it's just so remarkable. I you just take that body of work, that changed how we do things, how we see the universe,\nhow we understand things, has led to so many subsequent discoveries, good ones and bad. - Well, all of it just taken together, ultimate progress.\n- That's progress, right? Science is what it is, we have to decide what we do\nwith that knowledge, right? We can always use things\nfor good or for bad. That's part of the human endeavor as well. - And also part of the human endeavor and the human nature is the issues with corruption and credit assignment and all these kinds of things that make this whole\nride so damn interesting, about what's right and wrong and about the nature of good and evil. And that seems to surface itself in all kinds of places all the time still. - Yes, yes. Lise Meitner was nominated\nfor the Nobel Prize 40 times, more than that even. It's amazing. She holds the record for that. She never received it, so case in point. - Yeah. And, of course, the Nobel\nPrize has its complexities. One is the credit assignment; but two, even in astronomy, sort of assigning credit\nto a handful of folks when so many more contributed\nis a complicated story also. - [Anna] Yeah, it's very complex. - Okay, sorry for the romantic question, but what to you is the most\nbeautiful idea in astronomy, in stellar astronomy? - Well, so early on, you know, when I was in high school, I was thinking like, \"Okay, what do I wanna do when I grow up?\" Right? (chuckles) I knew I wanted to do astronomy, but I was a little bit torn because my interests\nwere definitely stars, stellar astronomy, but also chemistry. I always had a fascination\nabout the elements, so Marie Curie was a big role model. My friend actually made a beautiful, produced a beautiful movie about the discovery of the elements. It's a theater play, but digitized. When I saw it, I could actually kind of relive the sort of discovery\nmoment that Marie Curie had. It sent shivers down my spine. It was fantastic. I mean, this is the kind of thing that I wanted to experience. But, yeah, so nuclear physics and element creation and formation was really\ninteresting to me, chemistry, the elements,\nstars, and all of that. And I was like, \"I don't know if I ever find something that combines all of these things.\" And then I ended up in Australia, and met this person and he\nwas working on old stars. And as I was sitting in his talk, hearing about this for the\nfirst time, it kind of, it clicked all over my head and it's like, \"Oh, my god.\" It all fell in place because\nwe can use these old stars to study the elements, to learn how they're formed. We can get these clean\nsignatures that help us inform the nuclear synthesis processes, you know? And, of course, I need to\nknow a lot about stars too. So it's like all together. And that was sort of a moment of magic. And then the fact that I have\nnow done that for 20 years is just like I won the lottery. - It all clicked into place. And so in some sense it's an\nongoing love story for me, if I could say it like\nthat, where, you know, I found my stars, my thing, and I am fortunate enough to\nbe able to keep doing that. And I'm happy to see\nwhere it will take me. You know, it's an evolution. As with every relationship, if you don't march forward,\nyou move backwards. I'm not interested in moving backwards, so I'm letting the field\nand the discoveries and the findings lead me to... You know, and I'm often... It's not hard for me to\nfollow sort of my hunches. And sometimes even at\nthe telescope, it's like, \"Hmm, let's take a look at this one. I have a good feeling.\" And then usually something\ngood or, you know, not bad pop pops out at the end. And I really like that, A, that I have the freedom to do that, that I'm allowed to follow my hunches. Too many people, I think, are sort of boxed in with their job or their life that they don't\nhave that kind of freedom. That's really important to me, and I certainly try to make use of that. I also try to teach that to others, to trust them, to learn... You need to learn your things, but then you need to\nalso trust that knowledge and that you have a grasp on it, right? You get out what you put in. And being able to contribute\nin meaningful ways to our knowledge about\nour cosmic ancestry, our cosmic history, that's a wonderful thing. (laughs) - And in this way, your personal love story\nwith the stars evolves. What advice, you've already\nspoken to it a little bit, but what advice would\nyou give to young people that are trying to find\nthe same kind of love story in their career, in their life? - It seems increasingly\nhard for folks to find that. Sometimes I feel that, you know, young people have all the\nopportunities these days, and that's wonderful. But it's almost like that leads to some... What's the right word? They're a little bit too tired\nto make all the decisions because at some point you need\nto put your eggs in a basket and you need to be okay with that. We can't do all the things even though we're often told, \"You can be president too.\" And I think that's really\nimportant to convey. But at the end of the day, we can only have sort of one\njob or one type of profession. I'm not saying, you know,\nyou need to be locked in, but it's hard to change 180 degrees. And so lots of people, I think, are often afraid to really dig in at least for some time and\nget the hands real dirty and really learn from the bottom up. - [Lex] One thing. - On one thing, because they're afraid they're missing out on 99 other things. But life is a little bit\nmissing out on 99 other things because we only have 24 hours in a day. I have that feeling very often. There are so many things\nI would like to do, many things I would like\nto try to be good at. Sometimes I wish I had a\ndifferent job, you know, because I have other\ninterests too, but I realized, \"Okay, I can only do one thing.\" So I have no regrets. But this is a general feeling that I would think most of us have. But if it stops you from really digging, drilling down on one thing, to become an expert in one thing, to become really good at one\nthing that you call your own, then it just makes it difficult. - And so a fulfilling life is in part likely to be discovered in a singular pursuit of a thing, of one thing. - [Anna] Well, yeah or- - At least for a time. - Yeah, for some time, with your heart and your hands. Because I think most people\nlong to own something. You know, we all, I think, wanna leave some legacy of some sorts, you know, for our children, for humanity, for this planet. (laughs) And I think it's really important for young people to strive\nfor that and not lose sight or trade that for all the opportunities because an opportunity is nothing if you don't do anything. You need to do something\nat the end of the day. So I chat with lots of people about this, and I often start by just saying, \"Hey, tell me what you don't like,\" because it's often much easier to- - [Lex] Just narrow down,\nnarrow down, narrow down. - let out what's not on your plate, and then this way we\nget a little bit closer. And then it's like, \"Well,\nwhy don't you take a risk and just sign up for\nsomething for three months? You can afford that.\"\n- But that's what it feels like. That's what it feels like;\nand it is that, it's a risk. Commitment is a risk.\n- Yes. - Because it's you're\nbasically sacrificing all the other possible options. But then I guess you have to trust the magic you noticed in that thing. If you notice one thing,\njust stick with it. And then maybe there's something there. - Right, right. And this moment of kind of feeling it in your entire body and mind that this is the right thing, you know, getting there is probably really hard. But if you don't try, you won't find out. - The hard stuff is the fun stuff, that's also another thing to find out. - And then there is that. Yes. - Somehow, it doesn't make sense. You also mentioned that you\nhave taken a little stroll into the artistic\nrepresentation of yourself. Can you speak to that for a little bit? - Yes. Well, I already just mentioned\nsometimes I wish I, you know, had more time to do other things. So I find little sideways, I guess, to pursue things that I\nlike besides astronomy, or at least I try to find connections. And so some years ago, I, again, with the help of my friend who\nmade this Marie Curie movie, she and I wrote a one-woman play where I actually portray Lise Meitner who was an Austrian\nGerman nuclear physicist. I'm from Germany, so I have\nthe right accent for that. (Anna laughs) And we wrote this play about this moment of\ndiscovery of nuclear fission. Again, this is an\nabsolutely critical piece that explains my work today. And we all stand on\nthe shoulder of giants, she was one of those giants. And in some ways it's, of course, a way for me to acknowledge\nother people's work that have come before me. It's a wonderful way to highlight the contribution by a prominent woman. And the way I do it is it's a 25-minute play in costume where I re-live, for people,\nthe moment of discovery, then I turn into myself and then I give a 30-minute presentation on the r-process and the\ncreation of heavy elements because the audience can now\nperfectly understand that, the public audience, given the historic\nbackdrop of this discovery that they just lived, through my presentation. And it's a wonderful compliment that almost spans 100 years\nfrom one woman to the next passing on the torch. And, you know, when we write up our\nresults, let's say, you know, in magazines like \"Nature and Science,\" it's always about the results\non the golden platter, perfectly prepared. The discovery is never described, only ever the results. You asked me beforehand, right, \"What does it feel to be at\nthe telescope in this moment?\" Right? I'm happy to talk about this, but it's nowhere written ever, nobody really talks about it. And so having a form of, you know, theater of the arts to\nbring this exciting moment, that is what we all want to\nexperience as scientists, to a wider audience is so\nprofound and so rewarding. And they all love it because everyone can understand\na moment of discovery. I was looking for something\nand then I found it. It's like you misplaced\ncar keys, right? (laughs) - Or love.\n- Yes, yes. Everyone can understand that.\n- Both are glorious experiences, yes. - The implications and the findings, that is much harder to\nunderstand for anyone. this is where the\nscientists' work truly lies, this is our job. But the moment of discovery\nis easy and it's beautiful and it needs to be said. And so taking my audience on this journey: What is the perils? What are my worries? And then, \"Ah, here is\nthe moment of discovery. Let me tell you about it. It profoundly transformed me. And here's how it went,\" right? It's so good. - And art is a way to reveal this fundamental human side of science. - Yes, it's... The problem with science is\nthat it's people doing it. Maybe not a problem, but that is it.\n- That's also what makes it beautiful, right? I mean, humans are fascinating in that we're able to\ncome up with these ideas through all the struggle, through all the hardship,\nthrough all the hope, through all the search we find- - And so the art is a\ngreat way to portray that and to broadcast that, right? I think this is how the audience really should be\ninteracting with scientists, much less about the findings but really more about this\nyearning for answers, right? \"I need to find these car keys. I need it because I need to go,\" right? It's like, \"Now, now!\" (chuckles) And then, \"Oh, God, here it is. Now I can go my merry ways.\" It's so relatable. We just need to find more\nand better ways to do that. So I hope to turn this into\nalso a digitized version at some point to, again,\nmake it more accessible. - [Lex] I hope so too. I would love to see it\n- So far I'm just doing it in person, (laughs) but it's really nice. - I would love it. I think a lot of people\nwould love to see it, so hope you do just that. Let me ask you a big, ridiculous question. You look up at the stars, you\nlook up at the early, early, early stars. So let me ask the big question that we humans often ask\nand struggle to answer. What's the meaning of this whole thing? Why are we here? - We talked about, you know, the biological evolution\nrequires the chemical evolution for all of this to kind of play out, and carbon played this important role. And, you know, in some sense we're just a consequence of all of these things being\nthe way they are, right? So maybe this is just where we are supposed\nto be because, you know, the laws of physics sort\nof work the way they do. And we talked much about the\nvariety of everything, really, certainly, you know, from over here to over there, and things in the\nvicinity of where the sun and the solar system formed, they were the way they were and life maybe was a\nnecessary consequence of that. In some sense, I like to believe that because\nthen it becomes reproducible and we can apply that\nsame argument elsewhere. If it's total chance, right, that makes it harder. That's not truly\nsatisfying to a scientist. - So it's a consequence of\npsychological evolution, which is a consequence\nof biological evolution, which is a consequence\nof chemical evolution, consequence of physical\nevolution, whatever, whatever disciplines. It's turtles on top of turtles. - Turtles all the way\ndown, yes. (chuckles) - And you have studied some\nof the most ancient turtles at the very bottom of the thing. (Anna and Lex laughing) - That's right. That's right. They live for quite a while. - Yeah, they do. Well, thank you for your incredible work. Thank you for highlighting\nboth the human side and the deep scientific side. It's just, I'm a huge fan of your work. And thank you for everything you do. And thank you for talking today. This was awesome. - Of course. It was wonderful. Thank you. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Anna Frebel. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with\nsome words from Douglas Adams in \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\": \"Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end\nof the western spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small\nunregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance\nof roughly 92 million miles is an utterly insignificant\nlittle blue-green planet whose ape-descendant life forms\nare so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.\" Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time."
