He's one of the most influential\nand effective presidential advisors in modern history, helping conduct negotiations\nwith some of the most powerful leaders in the world and\ndeliver results on trade, criminal justice, reform, and historic progress towards\npeace in the Middle East. On Thursday, October 5th, we recorded conversation\non topics of war and peace, history and power in the\nMiddle East and beyond. This was about a day and a\nhalf before the Hamas attack on Israel, and then we felt we must sit down again\non Monday, October 9th, and add a discussion on\nthe current situation. We open the podcast with a\nsecond newly recorded part. My heart goes out to everyone\nwho has and is suffering in this war. I pray for your strength\nand for the long-term peace and flourishing of the Israeli\nand Palestinian people. I love you all. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" And now, dear friends,\nhere's Jared Kushner."

      "text": "We did a lot of this conversation\nbefore the Hamas attack on Israel, and we decided\nto sit down again, and finish the discussion to address the current situation,\nwhich is still developing. If I may, allow me to summarize\nthe situation as it stands today, it's morning Monday,\nOctober 9th, on Saturday, October 7th at 6:30 AM Israel time, Hamas fired thousands of\nrockets into Southern Israel. The rocket attacks served\nas cover for a multi-pronged infiltration of Israel\nterritory by over 1000 Hamas militants, this is\nshortly after at 7:40 AM. The Hamas militans went door to door in border towns killing\ncivilians and taking captives, including women and children. In response to this, Israeli Air Force began\ncarrying out strikes in Gaza, also fighting on the ground\nin Israel to clear out Hamas militans from Israel territory\nand preparing to mobilize Israeli troops for a potential\nground attack on Hamas and Gaza. Now, of course, this is what\nit appears to be right now, and this along with other\nthings might change, because the situation is still developing. The IDF is ordering civilian\nresidents of Gaza to evacuate their homes for their safety. Benjamin Netanyahu declared\nwar in several statements, and warned Israelis to brace themselves for a long and difficult war. Just today, Israeli\nministers ordered a quote, \"Complete siege of Gaza,\" interrupting supplies of electricity, food, water, and fuel from Israel to Gaza. As of now, October 9th, the death toll is over 1200\npeople and over 130 hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas. So, as I said, the events\nare rapidly unfolding, so these numbers will sadly increase. But hopefully our words\nhere can at least in part, speak to the timeless underlying\ncurrents of the history, and as you write about the\npower dynamics of the region. So for people who don't know,\nGaza is a 25 miles long, six miles wide strip of territory along the Mediterranean Sea. It borders Israel on the\neast and north and Egypt, on the southwest. It's densely populated,\nabout 2.3 million people. And there's been a blockade\nof Gaza by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took power. I could just summarize that\nHamas is a Palestinian militant group, which rules the Gaza Strip. It originated in 1988, and it\ncame to power in Gaza in 2006. As part of its charter, it's sworn to the destruction of Israel, and it is designated by the\nUnited States, European Union, UK, and of course, Israel\nas a terrorist group."

      "text": "- So given that context, what are your feelings as a human being, and what is your analysis\nas the former senior advisor to the president under\nthe Trump administration of the current situation\nin Israel and Gaza? - So, I think you did an\nexcellent job of summarizing a lot of the context, but watching what's unfolded\nover the last 48 hours has been truly heartbreaking to see. We're still in the early\nstages of what's developing, but seeing the images on\nX of, you know, militants, terrorists going door to\ndoor with machine guns, gunning down innocent civilians, seeing beheaded Israeli soldiers, seeing young 20 year olds at a rave, a dance party to celebrate\npeace with militants flying in, and then, you know, shooting machine guns to kill people indiscriminately, seeing young children captive,\nand then held prisoner, seeing 80-year-old grandmothers, a Holocaust survivor,\nalso being taken captive. These are just images and actions that we have not seen in\nthis world since 9/11. This is a terror attack on\nthe scale of which we have not seen, and it's been incredibly\nhard for a lot of people to comprehend. My heart goes out, obviously,\nto all of the families of the victims, to the families of those\nwho are held in captive now, and to all of Israel, because one of the beautiful\nthings about the state of Israel, is that when\none Israeli is hurting, the entire nation comes together. It's a shame that it's taking\nan action like this to unify the nation, but I have seen incredibly\nbeautiful signs over the last 48 hours of a country coming together. The Jewish people have been\nunder oppression before, the Jewish people know what it's like. And seeing people rally together\nto fight for their homeland to try to reestablish safety is a very beautiful thing to watch. I wish it wasn't something\nwe had to watch, but it is. With that being said,\nthough, the backdrop, I've been speaking to friends\nover the last couple days. One friend I spoke with last\nnight who was saying that, a good friend messaged\nhim saying, \"I'm going in. We're gonna do some\noperations to try to free some of the hostages held\nin one of the kibbutz,\" messaged him the next morning. He was one of the first\nthrough the door to try to free these hostages, and he was\nkilled by a Hamas militant. And sadly, we're gonna\nbe hearing many, many more stories of brave Israeli\nsoldiers trying to get these terrorists out of Israel, trying to free innocent\ncivilians who unfortunately are risking their lives to do it. And, you know, they're all heroes, but some will have a less\ngood faith than others, sadly. So it's a very, very heartbreaking moment. And I do think that it's\nvery important at this moment in time for the entire world\nto stand behind Israel. I think that Hamas has shown\nthe entire world who they really are. I think what their aim is,\nwhat they're willing to do, and, all of the strong security that Israel's put in place over the last years, which in some\ninstances was criticized, I think is now being validated, that there was a real\nthreat that they were looking to deter. So, short answer is, my heart\nis broken, praying for peace, praying for strength, praying for praying for Israel\nto do what it needs to do to avoid being in this situation again, which is either eliminating\nor severely degrading Hamas' capabilities. There cannot be peace in\nIsrael and in the Middle East, while there's a terror group\nthat is being funded by Iran that is allowed to flourish\nand is allowed to plan operations that are gonna aim\nto kill innocent civilians. And so, as somebody who was\nformally in this position, who was intimately involved with Israel, with the strategies to\nminimize attacks from Hamas, and to try to turn the region around, and I think we did do\na very substantial job under President Trump. The Middle East went from one\nof the most chaotic regions in the world. You had ISIS in 2016, ISIS had to caliphate the size of Ohio. They were beheading journalists. They were killing Christians. They controlled 8 million people. They were planning\nattacks all over the world from their caliphate. They were using the internet\nto radicalize people. We had the San Bernardino\nshooting in America. We had the Pulse nightclub\nshooting in Orlando, and there was real threat. And then you had Iran, which was given $150\nbillion in a glide path to a nuclear weapon. And they were using their\nnewfound riches to fund Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis,\ndifferent rebels all over the region that were looking\nto destabilize further. Syria was in a civil war where\n500,000 people were killed. Yemen was destabilized,\nLibya was destabilized, and it was just a mess. And all of America's\nallies had felt betrayed. President Trump came into power. We rebuilt the trust and the relationships with all of our traditional allies. We were able to eliminate ISIS,\nthe territorial caliphate, and then we're able to project\nstrength in the region, really go after Iran's wallet. We were able to stop\nthrough crushing sanctions, a lot of their financial resources, which they were using to\nfund all these terror groups. And so we left the Middle\nEast with six piece deals, and a fairly peaceful world. So seeing what's happening, I think it was completely avoidable. I think it's horrible to\nsee that it's occurring, and I pray that those in power\nwill make the right decisions to restore safety, but also to potentially create\na better paradigm for peace in the future."

      "section": "History of Hamas",
      "text": "- So I have a lot of\nquestions to ask you about. The journey towards this historic progress towards peace with Abraham, of course. But first on this situation, to step back and some of the history, is there things about the\nhistory of Hamas and Gaza that's important to understand\nwhat is happening now? Just your comments, your thoughts, your understanding of Hamas. - I think you did an excellent job, Lex, of really giving the summary. Just a couple things,\nmaybe I'll add to it, is that Hamas was originally\nfounded from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, which is a group that's\ncaused a lot of issues in the region. They've, they've attacked\nIsrael many times in the past. There's a lot of discussion\nabout how Israel is an occupying power, well, in Gaza, in 2005, they withdrew from all the\nland, and then they say, \"Israel's an apartheid state.\" Well, Israel then gave\ngovernance of the region to the Palestinians. And then what's happened is, is the Palestinian people's\nlives have now gone down, not up since then. I will say that under Hamas'\nleadership in, in Gaza, the people who have suffered the most are the Palestinian people. I've watched cries throughout\nmy time in government from people saying, \"We wanna see the Palestinian\npeople live a better life.\" I agree with those people. I think that the Palestinian\npeople in Gaza are essentially hostages. In Gaza, you have basically, you know, 2 million people that are\nbeing held to hostage by 30,000 Hamas terrorists, and\nthat's really the problem. And I would just encourage people to push their attention\nand energy in this moment, and their anger towards Hamas, those are the people who are\nkilling innocent civilians, who are murdering indiscriminately. And those are the people who\nhave held back the Palestinians from having a better life. And just finally, what I\nwould say is, you know, what we saw with Hamas was\nthat if you go back to 2007, they basically had just\none plan that they did over and over. And, you know, we were very careful to try to\nmonitor very closely and stop the Iranian money and the\nresources from coming in. And again, we took a\nlittle bit of criticism from the international community for keeping the border tight. But unfortunately, every time you'd allow\nconstruction materials to go into Gaza, they'd use 'em to\nbuild tunnels, not homes. You would have equipment that\nwould come in to build pipes, they'd turn it into bombs. So it was very, very hard to figure out how do you get the resources into Gaza to help people live a better life, while at the same, time\nthe leadership in Gaza was taking all those resources, and turning it into military\nequipment to attack Israel."

      "section": "Iran",
      "text": "- What role does Iran play in this war in this connection to Hamas? Can you speak to the connection\nbetween Hamas and Iran that's important to understand, especially as this most\nrecent attack unfolds? - Sure. So the correlation, I mean, there's reports that Iran\nis behind the attack. Hamas has thanked Iran for their support. And it's been very well\nknown that Iran supports the destruction of the state of Israel. And I won't say Iran as a country, I'll talk about Iran in the leadership. There's actually a beautiful\nthing I saw on the internet, where one of the soccer games\nin Iran, they were trying to, you know, rally support for\nthe Hamas terror attacks. And a lot of people in\nthe crowds were chanting, FU to the regime, because\nI think the Iranian people, the Persian people generally\nare peace-loving people, who don't wanna see this focus on destruction and annihilation. But you saw this in 2015, 2016, when the Iranian government had resources, the region was less safe. And since, now, there's\nbeen more resources allowed to go to the Iranian regime by lack of enforcement\nof sanctions, and as a result, Iran is funding Hezbollah, Hamas, they were funding the Houthis. Now there's a little bit of a\ndeante between Saudi and Iran, which has led to that going down, which only further proves that\nIran was behind the Houthis, which is what the Saudis\nhad been saying for years, and Iran was denying. So there's a very strong\nrelationship between the two. And we always knew that the\nway that Iran fights wars or fights conflicts is never directly, it's usually through its proxies. And in this case, a Hamas has been a proxy for Iran who\nwanted to obviously see the destruction of Israel, but also does not wanna see the\nIsraelis and the Saudis come together for a peace agreement."

      "section": "Al-Aqsa Mosque",
      "text": "- So the name of this operation of the Hamas operation is Al-Aqsa Flood, referring to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. How much of this attack is\nabout the Al-Aqsa Mosque? - In actuality, I don't\nthink any of it is, but the Al-Aqsa Mosque is something that all of the\nShia Jihadists have used for years in order to justify their\nactions that are aggressive towards Israel. So this is something I'll\nmaybe even take a step back and go through. When I was working\ninitially in my first year on the peace plan, I was\ndoing a lot of listening. And quite frankly, a lot of what people were\nsaying to me didn't make sense. And the reason why I was\ntrying to figure out, they were talking about\nsovereignty over Al-Aqsa Mosque. The Al-Aqsa Mosque is\na mosque that's built in the Holy of Holies, the\nHaram ash-Sharif in Israel, where the Jewish beam ash, the holy temple was built\nin a very religious place. After the temple was\ndestroyed, then there was a big mosque built there. And it's one of the more\nholy places in Islam now. So the big thing everyone was saying is, \"What do you do with this land\nwhere you have a mosque built over a very big Jewish site?\" And I was hearing all of\nthe experts, and you know, I always say experts with quotes, because only in Washington\ncan you work on something for a decade and continue to fail, and then you basically leave,\nand are considered an expert. But that's one of the\nproblems with Washington, which maybe we could talk about later. But the notion here was I went and I said, let me try to understand what the issue is with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with the people, right? I always felt the politicians\nwere a little disconnected, so I commissioned several\nfocus groups, one in Oman, one in Cairo, one in\nDubai, and one in Ramallah. And I asked people, Muslims, \"What is the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict about?\" And time and time again, the most popular thing that\nthey said was that Israel was not allowing access to the\nmosque for Muslims to pray. And what was interesting was, is that Israel's policy is to\nallow anyone who wants to come and pray peacefully at the\nsites to come and pray. Sometimes they have security issues when there's provocations. But by and large, since 1967, when Israel was able to take\nback Jerusalem in a defensive war, just to be very clear, they were attacked in the\nSouth and they were attacked from the East. And they basically were able\nto beat back the Jordanians and the Egyptians, and then re-conquer the\nold city of Jerusalem. And during that time, immediately after, Israel then passed the Protection of Holy Places Law, which was, they basically took\nresources they didn't have. And they said, \"We're gonna\nrestore the Christian sites, the Muslim sites, the Jewish sites.\" And they've worked to allow\neveryone access to the mosque. So today, any Muslim who\nwants to come can come and pray at the mosque. The mosque is Israel's\nacknowledge that King Abdullah, the king of Jordan is the\ncustodian of the mosque. And as long as people want to\ncome to the country and pray peacefully, they're able to do that. But if you look at a lot of\nthe propaganda that's been used by ISIS or Iran to recruit terrorists, or to justify their incursions, they often say they're doing\nit in the name of liberating the Al-Aqsa Mosque. But from an operational and\npragmatic perspective today, any Muslim who wants to go to the mosque, you can book a flight to\nIsrael now through Dubai, because there's flights\nbetween Israel and Dubai. And if as long as your country\nhas relations with Israel, and they'll accept your passport in there, you can come and pray, and\nthat's what Israel wants. Israel wants Jerusalem to be a\nplace where all religions can come and celebrate together. But you have a lot of actors\nthat look to find ways to use these religious tensions\nin order to sow division, and justify violent behavior. - I wonder how it's possible\nto lessen the effectiveness of that propaganda message\nthat a lot of the war, a lot of the attacks are about\naccess to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Is there something you can\nspeak to why that message hasn't disseminated across the Arab world? - So Israel's good at a lot of things. They're not very good traditionally\nwith public relations. You know, after the\nAbraham Accords, you know, we made the first Abraham\nAccords deal in August, 2020, and then we made five other deals. We first did United Arab Emirates, then we did a deal with Bahrain, then we did deal with Kosovo,\nthen we did a deal with Sudan, then we did a deal with Morocco, and then we got the GCC deal done as well. The tension between Qatar,\nSaudi, UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain. And that was allowing us to\ncreate a pathway to then pursue the Israeli Saudi normalization. So we had so much momentum then\nthat the goal was just keep getting more countries to\nnormalize relations with Israel. Once you create the connection\nbetween people and create the ability for people\nto do business together, the ability for flights to fly between, then you would just start\nnaturally having people coming. And everyone has a smartphone today. So they can then post and combat the misinformation that's been out there. But the way this misinformation\nis not something that's new. You know, one of the characters who played a very big role in\nspreading the antisemitism, and the violence in Israel in the 1920s was a guy named Hajj Amin al-Husseini, who was known as the\nGrand Mufti of Jerusalem. He was very close with\nHitler and Mussolini, and he was working with them\nto try to get some claims to the Middle East once the\nJewish people were annihilated. And what he did for a very\nlong time was he did the same shtick, only it was before\nyet smartphones and YouTube, where he would say, \"The\nmosque is under attack. These imperialist Zionists are\ncoming in to try to destroy the mosque.\" And he would use that to\nraise money from Indonesia, from Pakistan, from all\nover the world, and then use that threat to justify\nrecruiting groups of young, vulnerable Muslim men, and then, you know, getting them in the\nname of religious rights to go and kill people, which really is more of a\nperversion of the religion than I think the true\nessence of what Islam is. I think Islam at as core,\nis a peaceful religion, and I think that's where a lot\nof the great leaders in Islam wanna take it. But the people who use Islam or the mosque as a justification for violence, those are people who I\nthink are, are really, they're disrespecting the Islam religion."

      "section": "Abraham Accords",
      "text": "- As you said, you helped make major\nstrides towards peace in the Middle East with\nthe Abraham Accords. Can you describe what it\ntook to accomplish this? And maybe this will help us\nunderstand what broke down, and led to the tragedy this week? - Yeah, so, you know, I always\nbelieved in foreign policy. I learned very quickly\nthat the difference between a political deal and a business\ndeal is that in a business deal, you have a problem set,\nyou come to a conclusion, and then if you buy or sell\nsomething, you either have, you know, more cash or you have a company. So a bit more to do, less to do. Political problem set is very different, where the conclusion of a problem set is essentially the beginning of a new paradigm. So when I would think about how do you move pieces around the\nboard, you couldn't say, \"Let me just solve the problem.\" You have to think about what happens the day after the signing, and how do you create a paradigm\nthat has positivity to it. So the biggest piece of what\nPresident Trump did during his four years in office was\nhe really strengthened the relationship with Israel, number one. And he did things like recognizing\nJerusalem as the capital of Israel. He moved the embassy to Jerusalem, he recognized the Golan Heights, he got out of the Iran deal. We did an economic conference\nin Bahrain, where we brought Israelis to meet with Saudi, and Emirati, and Qatari businessmen,\nand everyone came together. And each one of these instances\nwere unthinkable previously. And everyone said that if you did it, the world was gonna end. And every time President Trump\ndid one, the next morning, the sun rose, the next\nevening, the sun set, and things moved on. And so by doing that,\nwhat President Trump did, was he slaughtered a\nlot of the sacred cows of these false barriers that\npeople had erected and showed people that the vast\nmajority of the people in the Middle East,\nwhether they're Jewish, Muslim, Christian,\nwhatever religion they are, they just wanna live better lives. And so what we basically\ndid was create a paradigm where the voices for peace, the voices for together now\nfinally had a forum where they were able to do it, and\nwe did that in the backdrop. The way we're able to be successful, was we severely limited\nthe resources of Iran, and they were focused more internally, and they couldn't cause the\ntrouble that they were causing everywhere else. Since we've left, obviously,\nthe dynamics have changed, but the way you get to peace\nis obviously number one, through strength, and number two, by finding a way for people\nto be better off tomorrow than they are today. And what I found, was that\nmost of the voices looking for violence or trouble were\npeople who were just focused on what happened two years ago,\n20 years ago, 70 years ago, 1,000 years ago. People who are trying to\nso solve those problems in that context, often\nwe're looking more to use those past grievances as a justification for their power and for the bad behavior that they were looking to perpetuate. - So managing, as we have\ntalked about, extensively, managing the power dynamics of the region, and providing a plan. This is something you did\nwith the economic plan titled, \"Peace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian\nand Israeli People.\" Can you first of all\ndescribe what's in the plan? - Sure. So this was something I took on. I was working on the\npolitical framework between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and trying to understand\nwhat were the issues. And the issues were not very many. It basically was you had a land dispute, so you had to figure out where do you put borders ultimately. You had a security paradigm, which I was much more favorable\nto Israel's perspective on. And obviously the events of\nthe past 48 hours have fully justified that bias. And then in addition to that, you had to deal with the religious sites, but I felt operationally that\nwasn't actually as complicated as people made it, because you wanted to just\nleave it open for everybody. Then I went through, and I,\nI felt that the Palestinian leadership was fairly\ndisincentivized to make a deal, because there was just this paradigm, where for they had billions\nof dollars coming in from the international community. And I think that they feared\nthat if they made a deal, they would lose their\nrelevancy internationally, and the money would stop\nflowing into the country. So what I tried to do is to say, you know, my approach when I would get\ninto a hard problem and say, \"How do I understand all the\ndifferent escape patches? How do I try to eliminate them, and then build a golden\nbridge that becomes really, the only, but also the\nmost desirable pathway for the decision makers to walk through?\" And it wasn't always hard, and sometimes you have to\ngo and hold their hand, or you try to pick 'em\nup and walk 'em across. But, lot of these leaders\nare very reluctant to change. And the dynamics of the\nPalestinians also were such that I think they were fairly\nstuck where they were. So we developed a business\nplan for Gaza, the West Bank. We threw in some improvements\nfor Jordan and Egypt as well. I based it off of the\nvision 2030 that they did in Saudi Arabia, which I thought\nwas a visionary document. I went back through this\nprocess and I studied basically every economic project in\nthe post World War II period. So we looked at what\nthey did in South Korea, why it was successful with some\nstrong industrial planning. We looked at Japan, we\nlooked at Singapore, we looked at Poland,\nwhy it was successful. We spent a lot of time on the\nUkraine plan for the country, and why it wasn't successful. And that was mostly because\nof governance and corruption, which actually resembles\na lot of what's gone wrong with the Palestinians, where\nthere's no property rights, there's no rule of law. And what we did is we built\na plan to show, you know, it's not that hard, right? In the sense that between\nthe West Bank and Gaza, you had 5 million people. And we put together a plan, I think it was about $27 billion. We got together a conference. I had the head of AT&T, we had Steve Schwarzman\nfrom Blackstone came, which was very gracious of them. We had all the leading Arabic businessmen, the leading builders, leading developers. And the general consensus\nof that conference was that this is very doable. You know, we think that\nfor Gaza in particular, it would cost maybe maybe\nseven to to $8 billion to rebuild the entire place. We felt we could reduce\nthe poverty rate in half, we can create over a million jobs there. The only thing that people\nsaid was holding it back wasn't Israel, what was\nholding it back was governance. And eople wouldn't have\nconfidence investing there with the role that that\nHamas was perpetuating. So I encourage people\nactually to look at the plan. It was very thoughtful. It was 181 pages. We went project by project. Each project is costed out. It's a real plan that\ncould be implemented, but you need the right governance. And all of the different Arabic countries are willing to fund it. The international community's\nwilling to fund it, because they've just been\nthrowing so much money at the Palestinians for years, that's never been outcomes\nbased or conditions based. It's just been, you\nknow, entitlement money. And unfortunately, it hasn't\nreally achieved any outcomes that have been successful. So it's a great business plan. It just shows too rebuilding\nGaza, you know, could be easy. But like I said, you know, the problem that's held the\nPalestinian people back, and that's made their\nlives terrible in Gaza, has not been Israel. It's really been Hamas'\nleadership, or lack of leadership, and their desire to focus\non trying to kill Israelis, and start war with Israel over improving the lies\nof the Palestinian people. - And the current approach of Hamas, the more violence they perpetrate, the more they can hold onto power versus improving the lives of people. So they, as you said,\nmaybe you can comment on, they do not propose an economics plan. - I mean, Hamas has been running it now for 16 years and they don't\nhave a lot to show for it. And you know, our posture with them was basically a very simple deal. You know, if you think about\nwhat's the end state in Gaza, it's actually not that complicated. You know, there's no\nterritorial disputes, right? The border's the border. There's no religious issues there as well. You're not dealing with Jerusalem, you're basically just dealing\nwith the fact that, you know, Israel wants to make sure that\nthere's no threat from Gaza. So it's a demilitarization\nor some kind of security guarantee from a credible\nsource where Israel doesn't feel like Gaza can be used to\nstage attacks into Israel, or to fire rockets into Israel. And by the way, these\nare things I was saying, you know, three, four years ago\nthat that was the objective, and that was really the fear, now, that's been proven. Unfortunately, the fear has manifested, and in exchange, you\ncan rebuild the place, and you can give the\npeople a much better life. But Hamas has not shown desire for that, or a capability for that. And I don't think there's enough trust to allow them to do that,\nwhich is why, you know, under the current circumstances, if you do wanna have peace there, Hamas has to be either\neliminated or severely degraded, in terms of their military capabilities."

What has the current administration, the Biden administration\ndone different than the Trump administration, as you understand, that may have contributed to\nthe events we saw this week. - So all I can talk about are\nwhere we left them, right? We left them a place where\nthey had tremendous momentum in the Middle East. I met with them during the\ntransition and said, you know, look, you know, we even got\nthe Qatar-Saudi conflict done, no peace between Israel and Saudi would've been possible without that. So we even got that done\nin our lame duck period. And they came in and they said, \"Look, we wanna focus on the three Cs, which is COVID, climate change, and China.

We put such crippling sanctions on Iran that they went from about, I think it was 2.6 million\nbarrels a day of oil they were selling to\nabout 100,000 under Trump. So their foreign currency\nreserves were basically depleted, and they were broke. Same with the Palestinians. We stopped the funding\nto to ra the UN agency, which is totally corrupt. We've put $10 billion in there over time. I did a poll in the Middle\nEast in Gaza to say, \"Okay, we've invested $10\nbillion here as a country. Are we popular? Right? The US had a 7% approval rating. USAID had a 70% approval rating, but it just felt like a waste\nof our taxpayer dollars. And again, we wanted to\nmake it conditions based. The Biden administration\ncame in, number one, they, they started insulting,\nyou know, Saudi and Russia. Oil prices went up at the same time. What they did was they stopped\ndomestic production of oil. They disincentivized a lot\nof oil and shale production with regulations. They stopped pipelines,\noil prices went up. They stopped enforcing the\nsanctions against Iran, probably to get the oil prices lower to make up for what they were doing. They ran to Iran to try to make a deal. They started funding the\nPalestinians again right away. And I even said, you know,\nif you're gonna fund them, if that's your policy,\nI respect that, again, elections have consequences, and you can take a different policy. But what I would recommend\nis get some conditions, make them do some reforms, make them give property\nrights to people, make them, you know, do real economic\ninvestments for people. But they just went right away. So they were funding the Palestinians, not enforcing the sanctions. And then overall, just\nprojecting a lot of weakness in the region. So one of the most embarrassing examples is what happened in the\nUnited Arab Emirates. Again, an amazing, probably one of America's best allies over\nthe last 20, 30 years. They fought with us in Afghanistan. They were the first Muslim\ncountry to stand up and do that after 9/11 because they\ndidn't want it to be a war of the west against the Muslim religion. So they joined the fight, because they saw it as a\nfight between right and wrong. They have rockets shot into their country from from the Houthis. And they basically don't get a\ncall from the US for 17 days. They need their equipment\nthat they buy from the US, which creates job in the US. They need it restocked, we don't call. So they've severely degraded the trust that we had to rebuild with our allies. I think they've been\nworking now to get it back. They, after two years, started working with Saudi and Israel, which I think was good. I think that they realized after a stint, that maybe the process\nthat President Trump had created in the region\nwas the right policy. And keep in mind, you know, President Trump's policy\nthat I was working on, was very strongly criticized\nduring the first three years before we were able to\nachieve the results, because it was departure\nfrom the failed policies of the past. And so first there was\nreturn to those policies, appease Iran, let's\ncriticize Saudi Arabia. Then they started embracing\nand working on the Israel-Saudi deal, which was really exciting. I think we're all very excited about it, but they did it in public. And I think that that also was something, and I didn't have access\nto their intelligence. So I assumed that by doing it so publicly, they thought that they'd\neither had a deal with Iran, 'cause they were letting 'em\nget all this revenue where Iran wouldn't be a problem. But one of the reasons\nwith the Abraham Accords, we kept it so quiet during the whole time, was 'cause we always felt\nlike the troublemakers in the region, particularly\nIran, who we thought would be disadvantaged by having UAE, Saudi, Israel, altogether. Israel's a nuclear power. You have, you know,\nother strong economies. Iran seeks instability. They seek looking to create\ndivision in the region. And if you can create that\neconomic sphere where you have security from Haifa to Muscat, from Israel to Oman all the\nway through with Saudi, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, Egypt, that's an incredibly powerful\nblock, if you can make it secure and then get economic\nintegration that really could be a Middle East that thrive. So Iran obviously wanted\nnothing to do with that, and that's why they've\nbeen working to disrupt. So I think the administration has, they took an incredibly stable\nsituation with momentum. I think they underestimated\nthe way that Iran would approach the region to undermine, I think they gave way\ntoo much rope to Iran. And I think that they didn't\nseize when they had an opportunity of strength with\nthe Palestinians to try to drive to a conclusion that I\nbelieve could have prevented us being where we are today. Not to mention that, you know, even just three weeks ago, I mean, it's a bad look that they,\nthey just basically gave $6 billion to Iran in\nexchange for hostages. And then Iran's basically\nfunding these terror attacks are killing American\ncitizens you have in Israel. And it's a heartbreaking situation. Again, totally avoidable, and one that I think has been\nvery badly mismanaged to date. - If Trump was currently president, you were still working with\nhim on this part of the world, what actions would you take? What conversations would you have? What ideas would you be working with in order to unite the various allies that you mentioned in the Middle East over this tragedy, and\nnot let it be a thing that divides the Middle East, but make it a thing that\ncatalyzes progress towards peace, further progress towards peace? - So I wanna say one thing, Lex, I have a lot of friends\nwho are fans of Trump, who are not fans of Trump. But one thing I wanna say with\nabsolute certainty is that if President Trump was in office, this never would've happened. And when President Trump was in office, anyone who supports Israel or\nwho wants to see, you know, Jewish people not be\ninnocently slaughtered, he would never have\nallowed that to happen. It did not happen when he was in power. And I hope people\nrecognize that as something that's very, very true. How I would play the ball\nwhere it lies right now. Keep in mind we, we transferred the ball, it was on the green, now it's\nalmost like it's gone back, you know, 150 yards and\nit's in a sand trap. I think the way that I would\nplay the ball right now is, number one, is you have to show strength. I actually think President Biden's words were the right words. I see that they're moving\naircraft carriers to the region. Again, the purpose of having\na strong military, I believe, obviously, you know,\nif you get into a war, you wanna win the war. But the purpose of a very strong military, primarily, is to avoid a war. I don't know what kind\nof credibility the Biden administration has to show the strength, but right now, you have to\nsupport Israel completely. You have to really let\npeople in the region know that there'll be consequences\nif they try to escalate again. Again, we saw a little bit of\nrocket skirmish from Lebanon, from Hezbollah. But again, this is the type of\nthing that they have to know there'll be severe\nconsequences if they make this a multi-party fight. And I think sending a\nstrong message to Iran, I think that they have to see\nsome consequences from this, and know that they're not\ngonna be allowed to have a free reign to cause instability\nin that, you know, Iran doesn't usually fight face-to-face. They usually do it through proxies, but let's just all be honest\nabout where this is coming from and let them know that\nthere will be a consequence if they instigate these actions. And again, at least with\nthe Biden administration, they've had contact with Iran, they've been talking with\nIran, but they've allowed Iran, I mean, again, the number I saw last year, I think under Trump, the\nnumber was maybe, like, four or $5 billion of\noil revenue in total. I think last year it was\nsomething like $45 billion in revenue. This year, I think it'll be even more. That's a combination of\nthem driving up oil prices, but also allowing much more sales. You would think that they\nwould find a way to get them to behave and allow them\nto have this happen. Or if that's not the case, then be tough, go back to being tough,\nthat's what you have to do."

      "text": "- Building off of Abraham\nAccords, as you mentioned, Israel, Saudi normalization, there's been a lot of promising\nprogress towards this. What does it take to not\nallow this tragedy damage the progress towards\nIsrael Saudi normalization? - I think right now, it's probably not the best to think about that. I think that we want to think about that after whatever's gonna\nhappen is gonna happen now. I think right now the number\none priority for Israel has to be to fully regain\nsecurity in the country. And then number two is to\nfigure out how you can, like I said, eliminate or degrade the Hamas\ncapability, or other Iranian threats to make sure that you\nhave your security apparatus. I think that the Israeli\nleadership right now should proceed with that. And I don't think that they\nshould be thinking about normalization with Saudi at this moment. My instinct, and I've been watching this\nIsraeli Saudi normalization play out, obviously, just speaking with people, and seeing what I've been reading, and watching with great excitement, I think it would be a game\nchanger for the region. I think it's one of\nIran's worst nightmares to have Israel and Saudi\ninterlinked together. I think it'd be great\nfor the Saudi people, from a security perspective. What they're discussing with\nAmerica would be very strong. The ability to, you know, get different elements\nacross would be incredible. So what I would say with it\nis that the industrial logic held yesterday, and I think\nit will hold again tomorrow. So, you know, I always expect countries\nto act in their interests. I think that the deal that's\non the table right now between Saudi, Israel, and America\nis in Saudi's interests, It's in America's interests,\nand it's in Israel's interest. What's gonna happen now though, is the political dynamics are gonna shift. And I think that, you know, as we've seen with political dynamics, they come and go, I think\nlet's get through this moment, and then I hope at the right time, that those talks will be able to resume, and conclude in an appropriate way. And you know, it's funny, Lex, when I was working on the\nUS-Mexico agreement for the trade, you know, we would have,\nevery day there'd be a tweet that would go out, or\nthere would be an issue. I mean, people forget how intense it was between America and Mexico. And I would speak to my\ncounterpart of Mexico, after a rough day and you know, we were\nworking on something, we were making progress,\nit'd get blown up, and I'd speak to 'em and say, \"You know what, look,\nthey're not moving America. They're not moving Mexico. Let's just, let's stop for today. Let's pick up tomorrow, and let's find a new way\nto bring this forward.\" So I would just encourage\neveryone working on that, not to give up, to keep working hard at\nit, and to find a way. But like I said, I would take a little bit of\na pause for the time being. Let's let the current\nsituation play out, and then, hopefully, there'll be a\nway for it to move forward. - I just hope there's still\npeople on the US side picking up the phone and calling UAE, Saudi Arabia, just as human beings,\nas friends, as allies, and just keeping that channel\nof communication going. Maybe you can correct me, but I just feel like there's\njust simple human dynamics that play out here,\nthat divisions can form, and just run away from you\nover simple misunderstandings, over just the inability to see a tragedy from the same perspective\nbecause of conversations that could have happened,\nbut didn't happen. - I think there'll\ndefinitely be communication, but you know, words on phone\ncalls is worth so much. It's really, you know, trust between people and power. And obviously when you're\nin a position of power, you represent your country\nand your country's interests. But the ability to have trusting\nrelationships where people feel like they're okay taking\nmore risks to help each other, that's actually what's most important. So communication, I\nhope for, but you know, deepening and trusting relationships, that's what I believe makes\nprogress and keeps people safe. - And we talk quite\nextensively about the value of trust and negotiation and just working with leaders, which I\nthink is a fascinating conversation, and you've\ntaught me a lot about that."

      "text": "Let me ask you about the end here. What are the various\ntrajectories this work can take? In your view, what are\nsome of the end states, as you've said, which are\ndesirable and are achievable? - I mentioned this earlier, but whenever I would get a\nproblem set in government, I'd always think through\nfrom a first principle's perspective, what's the\nlogical outcome, right? And forget about all the\nreasons why it can't happen. That's what everyone in\ngovernments always rush to talk about. But I do think here, number one, Israel has to have a secure\nenvironment where they don't feel threatened from Gaza. And number two, is the\npeople in Gaza need to have an environment where\nthey feel like they can live a better life and have opportunities. So that's the end state. And so I think that the\ninternational community should come together. I do think that the people\nwho are usually putting blame on Israel should now realize that maybe they've been\na little bit harsh here, and that Hamas has been as big a threat, if not an even bigger threat\nthan Israel has been saying. And I do think that if the\ninternational community comes together and unites behind Israel, and really forces Hamas,\nand their Iranian backers to stop hostilities,\nto stop saber rattling, to stop misrepresenting the\nhistory in order to justify their violent behavior. And if they say, instead, \"We wanna hold you\naccountable, no more money.\" And they all say that\nthey're gonna stand behind Israel's efforts to eliminate their national security threats, and then we will all come\ntogether and only fund again into a framework that we believe\ncan be a long-term solution where the Palestinian people\nreally have a chance to live a better life, that's really\nthe best way to get there. There's tons of complicated factors, but that's the end state\nthat the global community should be looking to come together. And it's very achievable. It's very, very achievable. - As we stand here today, there's a lot of different\nways that this war can evolve. If a ground invasion happens\nby Israeli forces of Gaza, and if the number is correct\nof 100,000 Israeli soldiers, do you worry about various trajectories that can take of the\nconsequences that might have of an unprecedented ground troop attack? - Yeah, so I think as a leader, you know, you can't change yesterday, but you have the ability\nto change tomorrow. And that's a very important fundamental, I mean, that's true for all\nof us, not just leaders. But, you know, we saw with 9/11, how America was caught off\nguard by a terrorist attack. We acted somewhat rationally,\nsomewhat emotionally, which led to a 20-year war\nwith trillions of dollars lost, I think almost a million lives lost, not just American, but all lives. And it was a total tragedy what occurred. I think, right now, the\ntemptation is to be strong. I think that that's a necessity. I do think eliminating risk\nis the right objective. I think the goal should be\nto stay very clear about what the objective is, but also this attack\nwas very well planned. Not to walk into another trap. I think you have to be\nvery smart, very cautious. I've been happy to see that\nwhat they've been doing in retaliation so far has\nbeen somewhat measured, and they've taken their time to try to assess what's achievable. Again, I don't have access\nto the intelligence, and you know, we're talking\nat a very early stage in this conflict, so a lot could happen even by\nthe time this is published. But my hope is that they'll just stay very focused on what the objective is, and try to make sure that they're acting appropriately in order to do that. And I will say this too, that this has been different\nthan what I've seen in the past in that the\nattacks were so heinous, and so disgusting that I've\nseen the international community rally around Israel more\nso than I ever have. And I hope that Israel\ncontinues to keep the moral high ground and continue to\ncommunicate what they're fighting for, why they're fighting. And I do hope that the\ninternational community supports the objective, and they can\nwork together to achieve it."

      "text": "- BBenjamin Netanyahu, Bibi, somebody you've gotten to\nknow well in negotiation, in conversation, he has made statements, he has declared war, he has spoken about this\npotentially being a long and difficult war. What have you learned about\nthe mind in Benjamin Netanyahu that might be important to understand here in this current war? - Bibi is definitely a historic figure. You know, I'd meet with a lot\nof different world leaders, and some of 'em, I would say they're very, very special transformational figures. And some, I would say, \"How\nthe hell is this person running a country?\" And Bibi's somebody who has done a lot for the state of Israel. He has a tremendous understanding\nof the security apparatus. He has tremendous global relations. So for a crisis like this, I think Bibi's the leader you want, if you're Israel to be in that seat. I think he's ambitious in what\nhe's gonna look to achieve. He understands his role in\nhistory as somebody who's helped strengthen Israel\neconomically, militarily. And I don't think he wants to\nsee his legacy be somebody who left Israel more vulnerable\nthan it had to be. So I think in that regard,\nhe'll be incredibly strong, but I also think that he'll\nhopefully be calculating in the risks that he takes\nand not create more risk than is needed, and that's\neasy to say, you know, the two of us sitting here\nhaving a conversation, when you're sitting in that chair as a leader in the fog of war, it's a very hard decision to make. He's been here before. He knows the weight of the situation. I'm sure he knows the moment. And I pray that he'll do what's right here to bring the best outcome possible. - I wonder if you can comment on the internal political turmoil that Bibi has been operating in, and how that relates to\nthe tragedy that we saw. - On the one hand, the\npolitical turmoil is, it's a sign of a vibrant democracy. I think it's been actually\nnice to see how people have fought for their country and their beliefs in a democratic way. You compare that to the\nPalestinians where there's no democracy, there's no free\nspeech, there's no free press, you know, you can't disagree\nwith the leadership. You know, in Israel, if you wanna be homosexual, you can have a go to a\nparade and live your life. In Gaza, they'll throw you\noff a building and kill you. So in Israel you have the freedoms, which I think make it a special\nplace and you have a very vibrant democracy. With that being said, you know, the times in Jewish history\nwhere the Jewish people have been most vulnerable have been\nwhen there's been division, and that's when the temple is destroyed. But that's not just with the\nJewish people and with Israel, that's in all societies. So I definitely believe that\nthis division has left them less prepared for the\nsituation than it would. I do think there's real lessons\nwe should be taking from this here in America where we're in a time where we're very divided. But I do think that it'd be\nvery wise for our leaders to find the areas where we do agree and find ways to, you know, secure our southern border\nto make sure that we know who's in our country,\nwhat risks we all face. And I do think that that\ndivision definitely creates risk for countries."

      "text": "- Let me switch gears here and\njust zoom out and look at our society and our public\ndiscourse at the moment. What do you make of the scale\nand nature of the Palestinian support online in response\nto this situation? - This is something I've\nobserved over the years since I got involved with the\nIsraeli-Palestinian issue. With a lot of interest, I think a lot of the people\nwho are pledging support for the Palestinian people, I think that they wanna\nsee the Palestinian people live a better life. And I actually agree\nwith them in that regard. Unfortunately, I think many of them are\nincredibly ill-informed as to the facts on the ground. I think all of the people\nwho are advocating online for the Palestinian people, who are going to these\nmarches in support of them, I think they'd be best served\nif they really care about effectuating the outcome of\njoining with Israel right now and directing their anger\ntowards the Hamas leadership. I think that it's very\nclear that the group that's responsible for\nthe Palestinian people living the lives that all of\nthese people are angry about is Hamas. And if they direct their\nanger towards Hamas, and put the attention on\nthe failings of Hamas, and put forth a vision for what they'd like to\nsee leadership in Gaza do, and they respect that there's\na real fear that Israel has, and any country would have of\nhaving a group of terrorists next to them that's calling\nfor their destruction. I think that that recognition\nof finding a way for Israel to be secure and then\nhaving an opportunity for the Palestinian people\nto live a better life is the right pathway to try and pursue. - So to you, there's a clear distinction between Hamas and the Palestinian people. In that Hamas is the enemy of progress, and the flourishing of\nthe Palestinian people. - 100%. It's very, very clear. And I think that if people were\nhonest about the situation, if they spent the time to\nreally understand it, again, you know, if you follow the\nconference I did in Bahrain, we had all the leading\nbusinessmen there, and they said, \"We can rebuild Gaza very\neasily, we all want to.\" The leading Arab businessmen, the leading American\nbusinessmen, everyone wants to, they're just held back by Hamas. And so I do think having an\nhonest conversation about this at this point in time has\nreally only one logical conclusion. And my hope is that maybe\nthis conflict leads to that conversation being had. And if it is, then maybe that brings more\nunity and understanding, and we kind of get to a conclusion better that could improve the lives of the Palestinian people."

      "text": "- Pragmatic question about the future. Do you hope Donald Trump wins in 2024? And how can his administration help bring peace to the Middle East? - I think when Donald Trump was president, we had a peaceful world. Everyone said if he was elected, we would have World War III. Meanwhile, he gets elected, and he not only is the\nfirst president in decades to not start any wars,\nhe's making peace deals, he's making trade deals,\nhe's working with our allies, getting them to pay\ntheir fair share in NATO. He's having a dialogue\nwith China, with Russia, he's weakening Iran. And so I do think that the\njob he did as a foreign policy president was tremendous. I think, you know, now,\nmore and more people are starting to recognize that. Again, under President Biden this is the second war that's\nbroken out in the world. And when you have a weak\nAmerican leadership, the world becomes a less safe place. And so my hope and prayers\nare that President Trump is reelected and that he's able to then restore order, and calm,\nand peace, and prosperity to the world. - [Lex] From a place of strength. - That's the only way\nhe knows how to do it. - What gives you hope about\nthe future of this region of Israel and of the Middle East? - The Middle East for 20\nyears was an area of conflict. They spent all their money\non bullets and bombs. - You have young leadership\nnow in Saudi Arabia and UAE, and Qatar, and there's a\nmuch more ambitious agenda now for the region to make\nit an economic superpower, and hub of the world. Israel is one of the most\nburgeoning and exciting tech economies in the world. And if you think about it, it's almost like having Silicon Valley not connected to California. The thing that's held the\nregion back for all these years has just been the\nconflict and the division, and the lack of connectivity. But if you have that region, and if it can all come together, if you can create a security architecture, you have an incredibly young population, you have a lot of wealth and resources, and a lot of capabilities and know-how. And so I think that if\nit's managed correctly, and if Iran is, is, is\nable to be restrained, and suppressed with\ntheir ambitions to cause destabilization. I don't mean Iran, the country,\nI mean the Iranian regime. Because actually once you\nhave this economic sphere, if you could bring Iraq into it, if you could bring Iran into it, that makes it even bigger and stronger. And the Persian people are\nincredibly entrepreneurial, and incredibly industrious. So I do think that the region\nhas tremendous potential. It's just been held back by\nbad policy, bad leadership, bad objectives. And again, you know, when President Trump left office in 2021, the Middle East was really on a very, very positive trajectory. And if the right things happen,\nit can continue to be so. So, I'm praying at this moment\nin time that we navigate the current crisis, that the important objectives\nare achieved of eliminating the terrorists and their threats, and then allowing the leaders\nwho are focused on giving their citizens and their\nneighbors the opportunity to live a better life, are able to work together, and really dream, and be ambitious, and find ways to create a paradigm where humans can flourish."

      "text": "- What is the best way to\ndefeat hate in the world? - Hate is is a very powerful force, and it's much easier to\nhate people you don't know. It's funny, when I was\nworking on prison reform, one of the most interesting\npeople I met was a reverend, actually down in Texas who\nnegotiated the first truce between the bloods and the Crips, two of the notorious gangs\nin America, in prison. And I was very excited to meet him. And when I met him, I said,\n\"Well, how'd you do it?\" And he said, \"It was very simple.\" He says, \"I got all the guys together, and I had a tremendous amount\nof barbecue brought in. He says, \"And I got them meeting.\" He says, \"No drinking.\" Says, \"Drinking sometimes gets people a little bit more against\neach other,\" he says, but I got a meeting, and they\nstarted sitting down together and they started saying, \"You know what? You're just like me.\" And all of a sudden, they\nstarted finding areas where they were more together. Look, I've traveled\nall over the world now. I've been very fortunate to\nmeet people from different states in America. I have different political persuasions, different ages, different classes. And what I found is that\nthere's a fundamental driving amongst all of us where we\nall wanna live a better life. And, you know, people don't\nwanna fight naturally, but it's easy to fight\nwhen you feel wronged, or you feel like somebody\ndisrespected you, or somebody did something from hatred. And hatred leads to more hatred, which sometimes just pushes\nthat cycle further and further. So I believe that each and\nevery one of us has the power to stop that cycle. And we don't do it by being on Twitter, and yelling at people. We don't do it by just being critical. We do it by finding the\npeople we disagree with, by listening to them, by asking questions, by sitting with them. And then if we each take\nresponsibility to try to make the world better, then I think that there's no\nlimits to the incredible place that this world can be. - So as, as you've said, you've traveled all across the world. Do you think most people are good? Most people have love in their heart. - I do believe that, yeah. And you have some bad people. I mean, you have some real evil people. I mean, a big part of the work\nI did was on prison reform, you know, previously, the mentality was, is that the prison should\nbasically be a warehouse for human trash. And if you've made a\nmistake in this world, then we're gonna throw you out, and we're gonna make the\nrest of your life incredibly difficult because you're\ngonna have a criminal record, you're not gonna have access to jobs. But what I found is when I\nwould sit with people in prison, the people I've met through\nmy father's experience, and who I met along the\nway is that, you know, people make mistakes. We're all human. I think it's the right thing\nfrom a religious perspective to give people second chances. I always believe you shouldn't\njudge people by the worst mistake they make in their life. Unfortunately now, in\nthe era of social media, people will say one wrong thing, it sticks with them forever. They get canceled or they get put out. We're all humans, we\ngrow from our mistakes, we learn from our mistakes. And I think that some\npeople are just just evil. There are some evil people,\nbut I do think the vast, vast, vast majority of people are good. And I do think that people\nsometimes also can be in a bad place and then society can\npush 'em to a worse and worse place, but we all have the\npower to make them feel loved, make them feel heard. And and I think there's also\ntremendous power that we have as people to help people\nget to a better place. And so, you know, my wife and I, we've always tried to be a force for good. We've always tried to be, you know, we've always tried to provide\na place where people can discuss with each other. When we were in Washington, we would host dinners at\nour house all the time, or we would have Democrats and\nRepublicans sitting together. I saw a Senator Feinstein\njust passed away. We had a great dinner at her\nhouse when she was senator with her and her husband and Mark Meadows, when he\nwas on the Freedom Caucus. And we had actually a fascinating\ndiscussion about Iran. Mark was much more hard line than me. I had to actually bite my tongue. I was impressed at how much he did. Whereas, you know,\nFeinstein and her husband were like super into, you know,\nthey knew the Iranians well. They thought they were peace loving, and it was an incredibly\nrobust and respectful debate. And so I don't think we maybe\nconcluded anything that night, but it was interesting for\npeople to get together. Having a dinner at my house\nwhere I had Dick Durbin, you know, the number two\nranking Democrat in the Senate, Lindsey Graham, and Steven Miller, who's known to be a very\nhard line on immigration, discussing what an immigration\nreform could look like. I mean, they left that\ndinner saying, \"Wow. We hadn't spoken to\npeople on the other side. And we actually agree\non like 85% of things. Maybe something is possible.\" And so I believe that we should always be trying to push to make\nthe world a better place. And you only do that\nby listening to people, and connecting with people,\nand by respecting people. And, finally, I'll just say\non this is that, you know, I meet people all the time\nwho have so much confidence in their perspectives,\nand I'm very jealous that these people are able to\nbe so confident about every single thing, because\nfor me, I have, you know, some degree of confidence in\nthe things that I've studied and what I've learned, but\nI'm always trying to find people who disagree to kind\nof sharpen my perspectives, and to help me grow, and\nto help me learn further. And so I think that's kind\nof the beauty of the world, is that, you know, the knowledge\nbase continues to grow, the facts continue to change, and what's possible tomorrow\ncontinues to become different. And so as humans, we have\nto continue to thrive, to learn, and to grow, and to\nconnect, and if we do that, everything's possible. - Well, Jared, thank you for\nyour compassion, first of all, but also your wisdom today\non this very difficult, this tragic set of events, these difficult days for the world. It's a big honor to speak with you again. Every time I speak to you, I learned a lot about the world, and I deeply appreciate, like I said, your humility, and your\nunderstanding of the details of all the complex power dynamics, and human dynamics that\nare going on in the world. Once again, thank you for talking today. - Thank you. And Lex, if I could say\njust one final thing, which is that my thoughts and\nprayers are really with all of the people in Israel,\nand the innocent civilians as well from the Palestinian side. And my prayers are with the\nIDF soldiers that they should be safe and they should\nbe really watched by God to accomplish whatever mission will enable to make the world a safer place. Thank you for listening to\nthis newly recorded segment of the conversation that\naddresses the current situation in Israel and Gaza. And now, we go on to the\nsecond part of the conversation recorded on Thursday, October 5th."

      "section": "Geopolitics and negotiation",
      "text": "Given your experience in\nnegotiating with some of the most powerful and influential\nleaders in the world, what's the key to negotiating\ndifficult agreements in geopolitics? Start with a big question. - If I look back on the\ndifferent negotiations I had when I was in government, either\nwith leaders of countries, with representatives of leaders, or even with members of\nCongress to pass legislation, the most important thing\nI would draw back to would be trust. I think getting to know each other, understanding what was motivating\nthe other party to get to the outcome and making\nthem feel like you weren't going to use whatever information they gave you to benefit yourself at the expense of them is\nprobably what I would call table stakes, to have a shot\nat accomplishing anything that was hard in negotiation. After that, I would say taking maybe a first\nprinciples approach to what the outcome of whatever\nproblem you're looking to solve should be. Now you have different\nkinds of negotiations. I always try to create a\nframework in the negotiation where it wasn't me against you, it was always let's agree\non what the outcome is that we're trying to accomplish. Let's all sit on the same\nside of the table and say, \"We want to get to this outcome. How do we get there?\" Really trying to create a roadmap. And so once you understand the\ndestination you want to get to the endpoint, then you'd have to work\nbackwards and really try to put yourself in their shoes and\ntry to understand what were their motivations macro. Most of the time you had to\nassume that a leader's primary objective was to stay in power. And so all decisions made\nwould be made through the framework of what it\nwould take to do that, and how it would impact\ntheir ability to do that. And then finally, I would just\nsay that in any negotiation, you have to understand the\npower dynamics as well. And you have to then wait your\napproach in order to maneuver pieces to accomplish the objective. And so in areas where we\nhad stronger power dynamics, I'd always look at it and say, \"What are the potential escape\nroutes where a politician would say, 'This is just the reason why we can't get there.'\" And I'd always think, \"How can you try to eliminate\nthose escape routes, or make them much harder to accomplish?\" And then, ultimately, think\nabout what's the golden bridge that you wanna create for them\nin order to get to the other side where they were\nmotivated to get there, because it was in their\nself-interest to get there, but also because it helped accomplish the different objective. And I have many examples that\nI lived through with that. Obviously, negotiating in\ncongress for prison reform, I had to form a lot of\ntrust with Democrats, whether it was Hakeem\nJeffries or Dick Durbin. And then also on the Republican\nside with, I had Mike Lee, I had Lindsey Graham, I had\nTim Scott, Senator Grassley, and then also Doug Collins\nin the house was tremendous. And you know, every time\nwe maneuvered something, we would get attacked\neither from the left. There's a time we were being\nattacked by Nancy Pelosi, John Lewis, for not being,\nyou know, inclusive enough. And then there were times\nthat we maneuvered it, we'd be attacked from the\nright for maybe going too far. And ultimately we had to\nfind just the right place where we can get it done. And the same thing happened with USMCA, where we were negotiating\nthe biggest trade deal in the history of the world, which was $1.3 trillion in\nannual trade between Mexico, Canada, the United States of America. And we were able to form good\ntrust with the other side, and try to say, \"How do we\ncreate win-win outcomes?\" And ultimately we're able to\ndo something in a record time that people thought was very hard to do. And both of them in a\ndivided time of the Trump administration were bipartisan wins, with big, big votes in\nthe Senate and the house. - You have a lot of stories of this kind, sometimes a soft approach,\nsometimes a hard approach. There's, I think a story where would Bibi, there was a potential, like,\na dramatic election coming up, and you have to say, no, no excuses, no delaying, we\nhave to make this agreement.\" I know Bibi caress about\nIsrael more than the particular dynamics of the election. Like you have to draw a hard line there. - But in fairness too,\nlike, you know, for him, during the time that we\nwere dealing with him, he was always an election versus election, and then election and you know, what he was saying wasn't wrong. And I think he was more\nexpressing his concerns, given the dynamics. And you know, we never held\nthose concerns against him. We just said those are\nreal concerns he had. We respected those concerns, but then we helped him\nprioritize to help accomplish the right things. And that's ultimately what\nthe partnership is, right? My job was to represent America. His job was to represent Israel, and you had other parties\nrepresenting their own interests. And as long as you assume that, you know, people were acting mostly in good faith, you were able to navigate\nareas where you didn't have complete overlap of\npriorities and objectives. - Just to go back to the trust thing, you sometimes see that with leaders, where it looks like they're\ntrying to screw over the other person when they're talking. And so not having that I think\nis a really powerful thing for earning trust. People actually can\nbelieve that results driven are working towards a certain end. Is there a skill to that? Is that genetics, you're born with that, or is that something you develop? So basically, it requires\nyou to look at the game of politics and not have a\nkind of cynicism about it, to where everybody's\ntrying to manipulate you, and actually just go in\nwith a kind of open mind, and open heart and actually\nspeak truthfully to people, like, on of basic human level. - I would say that I always\nwould think about, \"How can I be a partner to others, like I would want somebody\nto be a partner to me?\" And a lot of it comes from\njust my different experiences in business. I've had great partners, I've had terrible partners. My father, you know, again,\na lot of my childhood was I was exposed to business. My father, on Sundays he\nwould take us job sites, and to the office with him\ninstead of to football games, like my friends' fathers would do. And so we were exposed to business. And what he would say about his father who was an immigrant to America, came over with nothing,\nhad no formal education, but he would always say, \"A good deal with a bad partner will always be a bad deal. And a bad deal, good partner,\nyou'll figure it out.\" And so, going through\nsome of the challenges, and that I had in my life\nearly on, whether it was the issue with my father that\nI'm sure we'll talk about, or even going through some\ntougher financial times during the great financial crisis, I really learned a lot about partnership. And I always thought, \"How can I act in a way where\nI could be the type of partner or friend to others that I\nwish others would be to me?\" - So when you look for a good partner, don't you think there's the\ncapacity for both good and bad in every person? So when you talk, when you negotiate with\nall of these leaders, aren't there like multiple\npeople you're speaking to inside one person that you're\ntrying to encourage, catalyze, like, the goodness in the human? - Yeah. So, leaders are generally\nchosen by their country. And so my view was, if I had an objective, I didn't get to choose who was the leader of other countries. My job was to deal with that leader, understand their strengths,\nunderstand their weaknesses, understand their power dynamics as well. You know, one of my greatest\ntakeaways when I grew up, I'd read the newspapers\nabout all these powerful, famous people. And then as I got older and\nhad the chance to meet them, and do business with them,\nand then ultimately, you know, interact with them in government, as I realized that they're\njust like you and me, they wake up every morning,\ntheir kids are pissed at them, their wife doesn't want to talk with them. And they've got a set\nof advisors around them, one saying, \"Let's go to war,\" one saying, \"Let's make peace.\" One saying \"Do the deal.\" One saying \"Don't do the deal.\" And they're all thinking,\n\"Where do I get advice? How do I make decisions?\" And so understanding the true\nhuman nature of them and then the different power dynamics around them, I thought was very key. And so I didn't have a choice,\ndo I deal with them or not, it was a function of how do\nyou deal with them effectively, in order to find areas where\nyou have common interests, and then work well together to pursue those common interests in order\nto achieve a certain goal. - First of all, you're\nincredibly well read. I've gotten to know you and\nI've gotten to know Ivanka, and the book recommendation\nlist is just incredible. So first of all, thank you for that."

      "section": "North Korea",
      "text": "You told me about \"The Guns\nof August\" by Barbara Tuckman. It's a book on World War I, and I went down a whole rabbit hole there. She's, like, an incredible historian. But anyway, there's a bunch of\nstuff you learned from that, but one of the things you\ntold me is it influenced your general approach to diplomacy of just picking up the\nphone, and giving it a try. So as opposed to planning\nand strategizing, just pick up the phone. - So this was a book I read way before the notion\nof serving in government was ever even on my mind or reality. And I remember thinking\nabout it, reading it, and thinking how World War I started, where you had, somebody was assassinated, and then you had all\nthese different alliances that were created. And then in order to\naccomplish objectives, it triggered all of these\npeople getting in bed with everyone else because of documents that were created without the intent of going to a massive war. And I think in the course of World War I, it was one of the greatest\natrocities that we've seen as humanity. We've had 16 million\npeople killed in that war. And I was reading the book, I remember thinking to\nmyself, even though, you know, things are set in a certain\nway, go sit with somebody, go talk to them and say,\n\"This doesn't make sense. This is wrong. How do we create a better pathway?\" And as a civilian all my life, you know, I would read the newspapers, I would observe how\ndifferent leaders would act. But when we had the opportunity\nto serve in government, and have the position, you\nrealize you're not a civilian. You don't have the luxury of sitting back, and letting the world happen\nthe way it's happening. You have agency and you have\nthe potential to influence the outcome of things. And one thing I've seen is, you know, most political prognosticators are wrong. Anyone who tells you what's\ngonna happen really has no clue. And it's not because they're\nbad or they're not intelligent, it's because nobody knows.\nAnd at the end of the day, the outcomes in the\nworld are usually driven by the decisions of humans. And if you're able to come\ntogether, form relationships, listen to each other, you can do that. And one of the great examples\nthat I speak about in the book is with North Korea, whereas\nif you remember in 2017, it was very intense when President\nObama was leaving office, he told President Trump\nthat the single biggest fear that he had, and this is a\ntime when the world was a mess. The Middle East was on fire, ISIS was beheading journalists\nand killing Christians. They had a caliphate the size of Ohio. Libya was destabilized,\nYemen was destabilized, Syria was in a civil war where\n500,000 people were killed. Iran was on a glide path\nto a nuclear weapon. Yet the single biggest fear\nhe had was North Korea. And then it got compounded\nby the fact that we get into office and President Trump\nbrings his generals around, and he's learning how to interact with all the generals and says, \"Okay, what are my options?\" And they said, \"Calm down. We've been using all of our\nammunition in the Middle East, we don't have enough ammunition\nto go to war over there.\" And he says, \"Let's not\nlet that be too public. Let's try to restock,\nand come up with a plan.\" At the time, there was a lot\nof banter back-and-forth. I got a call from a friend\nwho was an old business contact who actually had\ndone business in North Korea. And he said, \"I'd love to\nfind a way to solve this.\" And I was getting calls from\nfriends at the time saying, \"I'm trying to go to Hawaii for vacation. Should I not be going, is it not safe?\" I mean, forget this\npsychology of how intense that was at the time. And then through that interaction, he called some of his\ncontacts in North Korea. And then we were able with the CIA, to open up a back channel\nthat ultimately led to the deescalation, the meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un which led to a deescalation. So that was really the mindset, which was, whenever there's a problem, just pick up the phone and try. And I think President Trump\nhad a very similar approach, which was, let's give it a shot. And he wasn't afraid to go\nafter the hard ones too. And I'll say one final thing on this, which is that in politics, the incentive structure\nis just much different than in the real world, right? In the sense that you have a hard problem, than if you try to solve a hard problem, the likelihood of failure is great. Whereas in the business world, if you're going after a hard problem, we celebrate those people, right? We want our entrepreneurs\nand our great people. to go after solving the big hard problems. But in politics, if you try\nto take on a hard problem, you have a high likelihood of failure, you'll get a lot of\ncriticism on your pathway to trying to accomplish that if you fail. And then if you fail, it has a higher probability\nof leading to you losing your opportunity to serve. And so it's just one of these\nthings where people wanna play it safe, which is not the\nnotion that really was taken during the time that\nPresident Trump was in office. - Do you think it has to be that way? I think there's something\nin the human spirit, like, in the public\nthat desires politicians to take on the big, bold problems, right? Why is it that politicians need\nto be so afraid of failure? - I don't think it has to be that way. And that's, I think,\none of the great lessons from the time and of the\nTrump administration. He brought a lot of people from the business world into government. The business people have\na much different mindset than government people. And there was a lot of resistance. And I think part of why\nthere was so much resistance was because, I think about\nit from my personal sense, was that if I was successful\nwith no traditional qualifications to do diplomacy, it meant that all the people\nwith traditional qualifications and diplomacy didn't necessarily\nneed those qualifications in order to be successful. And that same sentiment\nmanifested itself in many areas in government. And I think that in the business world, it's outcome oriented,\nit's results oriented. And you know, what we would\nsee in New York, is there, they would stab you in the eye, in DC they would stab you in the back, and it just became a whole different-\n- Good line. - Dynamic of how you work\nthrough these different areas. So the answer is it doesn't\nhave to be that way. You just need the right courageous leader. And that's why I'm so\noptimistic about what the future of America and the world could be, if you have the right people in power, who are willing to take\non the right challenges, and do it in the right way. - If we just linger on the\nNorth Korea and the deescalation and the meeting, what's\nthe trajectory from this could be the most catastrophic thing that destroys the world,\nto you find back channels, you start talking, and\nstart arranging the meeting. Is there some insights you\ncan give to how difficult that is to do in that,\nin the North Korea case, which seems like to be one\nof the more closed off parts of the world, and in the other\ncases that you worked on? - Yeah, it's always very challenging, and especially when you're\ngoing against the grain of what's established, right? We did something different\nto think that an old business contact that I had could then do it. I mean, that's the type\nof thing that, you know, if the press knew what we were doing, they would've derided it, and criticized it in every which way. But that was one of the\nbenefits of operating very much below the radar, is that we were able to try\nall these different things. And not all of them worked,\nbut some of them did. But that is what's amazing\nabout the world, right? This could be the biggest story\non the front page of every paper, and they're\ninciting fear in everyone, and it's not illegitimate fear. I mean, there were\nmissile tests over Japan. You had a lot of very big\nchallenges with that file. And then all of a sudden we make contact, we go through a negotiations\nto set a meeting, there's a meeting between\nPresident Trump and Kim Jong Un. And then all of a sudden, there's a framework to try\nand move things forward. And again, I think that there's a lot\nof possibility there for what could happen if it's\nworked in the right way. - I just wanna know how\nyou worded that first email or text message, like\nwhat emojis to use, like, the hugging emoji. It's just personally I've\ngotten to know a lot of powerful and rich people and just, it's\nfunny that they're all human, just like you're saying. - And a lot the drama,\na lot of the problems can be resolved with just\nlike a little comradery, a little kindness, a little, like, just actually\njust reaching out and talk. - We're all human beings, and people wanna be successful,\nand people wanna be good. And and you're right too. there's way more emojis involved\nin diplomacy than I ever would've expected, but-\n- And every leader I'm sure has their favorite emoji. This is what I learned about people, everybody has their go-to emoji. I usually go to the heart\nvery quickly, emoji. There's some people who go\nthe hugging, whatever that, where you're, like,\ndoing the hugging thing. Anyway, this conversation\nquickly turned to the ridiculous, but to do another book reference,"

      "section": "Personalities of leaders",
      "text": "you mentioned the book\n\"Thirteen Days in September\" by Lawrence Wright in\ndiscussing all the work you've done in in Israel\nand the Middle East. I just wanna ask you sort\nof the interesting aspect of that book, which is the influence of the personalities and\npersonal relationships on these negotiations. You kind of started to allude\nto that with the trust, but how much do the\npersonalities matter in this? So going from North Korea\nto the Middle East here, to within Congress, and\nall that kind of stuff. - Yeah, completely in every way. I mean, that's an incredible book, and it's a very entertaining read. It has, obviously, a lot\nof good historical context on some of the key players, whether it was Anwar Sadat, or Manam , or Jimmy Carter and, and, and Sance and, and a lot of the others who were involved with those negotiations. And the thing that I kind\nof took from that experience was just how personal it was. And again, one of my favorite stories from that book was how Anwar Sadat, who was a big, big\nleader, he had a mystic, who was, according to\nthis book, again, history, I like reading it, but I always, you know, realize that you have to\nnotice that this is just the perspective of a given\nauthor that's writing it. But the way that they write this book, was that he had an\nadvisor who was a mystic, and the mystic was having a\nback channel with the Israelis, and the mystic told Sadat, if you go to Israel and you\nmake a speech at the Knesset, bacon is ready to give you the Sinai. And so he goes to Israel,\nthey set this whole thing up, he goes and gives the Knesset, they go for their meeting\nafter, and Sadat says, \"Okay, well, are we gonna do this thing? And Vegas says, \"What\nare you talking about? I'm not giving you an inch of our land.\" And it was just one of\nthese things where it was a miscommunication that brought about the symbolic visit of\nAnmar Sadat to Israel. And that was one of these\nnotions that just made everyone think that something was\npossible that they thought was impossible a moment before. And actually, we had an example\nlike that during our time in government, when we\ndid the Abraham Accords. The first step of the accords\nwas really a phone call between President Trump,\nPrime Minister Netanyahu, and Mohamed bin Zayed, who at that point, was the crown prince and\nde facto ruler of the UAE. But all we had was a phone call, and then a statement that was released. And what was interesting\nafter that is we said, \"Okay, well how do we integrate countries? Nobody's done this in a long time.\" And we were trying to\nfigure out all the issues, and there's big miscommunications\nbetween Israel and UAE, and we were navigating\nthrough all the issues. And so after a couple weeks,\nI said, \"You know what? I've gotta go over there and try to sort through these issues.\" So we make a plan to go to Israel, then we can go to UAE. And then a young gentleman\nwho worked with me, named Avi Berkowitz, says, \"Well, if we're\nflying from Israel to UAE, instead of flying on a government plane, why don't we see if we\ncan get an LL plane, and we'll do the first\nofficial commercial flight?\" And so I said, \"That's a great idea.\" Let's call, you know,\nambassador Otaiba Yousef, who was a tremendous player\nin the Abraham Accords working behind the scenes, day and night, and was really a big catalyst. So he calls Yussef and he\nsays, \"Sure, no problem. Let's give it a shot.\" So we go and we do it and he says, \"If we can work at these\nissues, we'll do it.\" So we go to Israel, we do our meetings, we get everything back into a good place. We set up this trip over, we fly on an LL plane, we fill it up. At the time, it was during\nCOVID with a health delegation. We had the financial ministry, because we had to open up, you\nknow, banking relationships, they could wire money between countries. We wanted to get health partnerships. Then we just had a lot of legal\nthings and national security things we wanted to\nstart putting together. So we do this flight and\nwe end up landing in UAE, and the picture of us coming\noff the plane being greeted by, Emiratis and Thobs with a LL plane, with an Israeli flag on it just captured everyone's imagination. And so it was one of these\nthings where it's like you work so hard on the details\nand the negotiation, I mean hundreds of hours\nto kind of make sure everything's perfect. And the one thing that\nyou do kind of, you know, \"Yeah, let's give it a shot.\" That image ended up\ncapturing everyone's heart. So going back to Sadat, that\nvisit was very critical. And what was interesting was,\nis according to this book, it happened because of a miscommunication. That was the first part,\nthe second part of the book, that's just amazing theater. And actually the book was based on a play. It was just going back=and-forth with all of the the different methodologies that they tried that failed, but they kept trying at it. And then ultimately seeing how\nthe personalities were able to find ways to make the\ncompromise that ultimately was a very, very big\nthing for more stability in the Middle East. And so, amazing book, I\nwould highly recommend it, a very entertaining read, and something that at\nleast gave me encouragement to keep going when the\ntask I was pursuing seemed so, so large. - I mean, if you could just linger on the personalities, you write in the book that words matter, or you write in the context\nof saying in the diplomacy business, words matter. And then you said that \"We're\nin the results business\" is a badass line. But if we just stick to\nthe diplomacy business, and words mattering, it seems like one of the\nthings you really highlight, that individual words can really have, like, you can fight over individual words. So, like, how do you operate in a world where like single words matter? - I think you have to be\nrespectful to the craft that you're in where words matter, but then realize that\nthey don't matter as much. And then also focus on\nthe fact that, you know, the actions are actually\nwhat's gonna matter more than the words. And so you have a difference between leaders and politicians. You know, politicians are there to say the right thing\nand to hold the power. Leaders are people who are\nwilling to do things that will be transformational, from my perspective. And so when I would think about diplomacy, words without actions, or\nwithout the threat of actions, and that was something that\nPresident Trump did very well, was that people knew that he\nwas willing to take action. He was very unpredictable\nand how he would act. And that made our words\nmuch more effective in what they did. So it's all a combination, but you know, coming from the private sector, we are all about results, right? If you're in government, you can work on something\nfor 10 years and fail, and then retire, and they\nconsider you an expert. In the private sector, if you work on something for 10 weeks, and you don't have a success,\nthen you're unemployed. You know? So it's a different kind of notion. And it was just\nunderstanding the mentality, and trying to adjust, and bridging the divides\nbetween the different trainings."

      "section": "Government bureaucracy",
      "text": "- Is that the biggest thing\nyou took from your business background, is that just\nbe really results-focused? - It was just the only way to be. I mean, if I was giving up, you know, a nice life in New York, and if I was giving up the\nstuff that I really enjoyed, the company that I'd help build, and the life that I was enjoying in order to do government. I was going there to make a difference, and, you know, we had to focus on it. The other skillset, so there was a couple skill\nsets that I found were quite deficient in government. First of all, there was\na ton of amazing people. I mean, people talk about the bureaucracy. What I found was is you\nhad incredibly committed, passionate, intelligent, capable people all\nthroughout the government. And what they were waiting\nfor though was direction, and then cover in order to get there. And so there were a lot\nof tasks that I worked on, whether it was, building the\nwall at the southern border, where I was able to work\nwith Customs, Border Patrol, Army Corps of Engineers,\nmilitary, DHS professionals, DOD. And we basically all came together. And then once we had a good\nproject management plan, we were able to kind of\nmove very, very quickly. I think we built about 470\nmiles of border barrier in about two years, basically. And that worked very well, because we basically\nbrought private sector project management skillsets, which were quite often\nmissing in government. The second one is just, you know, we spoke about negotiation earlier. I would say that most\npeople in government, it's just a different form of\nnegotiation than you see in the private sector and way\nless effective in that regard, which is why I think it's\ngood the more we can encourage more people with private sector\nexperience to do a stint in government and to really try to contribute and serve their country. That's how our founders, I mean, George Washington and all\nthe, the founding fathers, they're working on their farms. They left their farms serving government, then they went back to the farm. And that was kind of the design of the representative government. It wasn't a career political\nclass, it was, you know, people coming in to, you know, show gratitude for the\nfreedoms and the liberties that they enjoyed and\nthen do their best to kind of help others have\nthose same opportunities that they had, and then they'd go back\nand live their lives. And so I think that there's\na lot of opportunity with our government of people with\nmore business mindsets who are gonna think about things\nfrom a solutions perspective, go and serve. - Is that one of the main problems here? So you also mentioned the book, \"The Great Degeneration\"\nby Niall Ferguson, an awesome historian,\nhe's been on this podcast, it helped you understand the\ninefficiencies of government regulation. I'd love it if you can give\nan insight into why government is so inefficient at times. Like, when it is inefficient,\nwhen it doesn't work, why is that the case? The bureaucracy that you spoke to, the negative aspects of the bureaucracy. - So we don't have enough\ntime on this podcast to go into it, but it's, look, there's a lot of aspects\nthat work as well, right? But I do think we've\ngotten too big, you know? Niall's book that you mentioned, you know, one of the things that I took from that, I read it I think in 2012, right kind of in the middle\nof the great financial crisis, was he was talking about how\ngovernment regulation often was put in place to deal\nwith old crises, right? So it was never gonna\nsolve future problems, it was more to kind of create, to solve for problems that\nhad happened in the past. And I remember thinking about that. One thing I was very proud of, of the work of the Trump\nadministration was that you had four years consecutively where there was a net decrease\nin the cost of regulations. So to give you a context, in\nthe last year of Obama in 2016, there was 6 million man hours\nspent by the private sector complying with new federal regulations. And that's not really what\nthe intent of our government was, right? If we have rules or regulations, those should be legislated by Congress. They shouldn't be put in by bureaucrats, who are basically saying, \"I wanna follow this objective.\" So using kind of the power of\nthe pen in order to do that. So the deregulatory effort\nwas actually very critical to Trump's economic success that happened at the beginning of the administration. And then what I saw with\nregulation was anytime either there was legislation or regulation coming, the people pushing for it were\nusually the people who would benefit from the regulatory captures. You had these, you look at\nthe great financial crisis, where you had this big banking reforms. Well, what happened during\nthe big banking reforms? Then you had a big reduction\nin the amount of banks that occurred, and the big\nbanks became even bigger. Whereas I don't think\nthat was the intention of the legislation, but the people who were\nwriting the legislation, and influencing it had a\nlot of the constituencies from those larger institutions. And then what happened\nas a result of that? A lot of these smaller institutions\ndidn't have the ability to be as competitive. They had more restrictions, more costs. They became less profitable. But these were the banks that\nwere serving small business, which is the biggest creator\nof jobs in our country. And then as a result, the bigger banks got more powerful, and what happened in\nthe country as a result of he regulations that they put in place? The wealth gap in the country\ngrew, it didn't shrink. And so I think you'll oftentimes, what they say these\nregulations are intended to be, the result often becomes the opposite. And so, you know what President Trump did in his administration was they did a massive deregulatory effort. And I think they pledged that\nfor every one regulation they put on, because you do need some\nregulation in an economy, and in a society, they would take off two. And in the first year they\neliminated eight regulations for everyone. And so that was just\nsomething I took from it, which was I thought, very interesting. And you had to really, I think you just have to\nthink through what are the consequences gonna be of\nthe different actions you take. And often, government gets\nit wrong by taking an action that feels right, but has big negative\nconsequences down the road."

      "section": "Accusations of collusion with Russia",
      "text": "- Let's go to some difficult topics. You wrote in the book about\nyour experience with some very low points in government. You've been attacked quite a bit, one of the ones that stands\nout as the accusations of collusion with Russia. And you tell in the book in\ngeneral, this whole story, this whole journey on a personal level, on a sort of big political level. Can you tell me some\naspects of this story? - Sure. So to give the\nlisteners some context, and people remember this now, it's been kind of swept away\nbecause it turned out not to be true, was that after President\nTrump won the election in 2016, instead of the media\nsaying, \"Oh, we were wrong.\" 'Cause again, everyone\nthought he had zero chance of winning. They said, \"Okay, well we\ncouldn't have been wrong. It must have been the\nRussians who worked with him.\" And so at first, when\nthis started coming up, I thought this was ridiculous. I mean, I was very intimately involved with the operations of the campaign. I was running the finance of the campaign, I was running the digital\nmedia of the campaign. I was running the\nschedule for the campaign. And I knew that on most\ndays we had trouble, like, working, coordinating\nwith ourselves, let alone collaborating with another government, or colluding as they called it. And so we did a great job, I\nthink as an underdog campaign, very leanly staffed. And then they said that we\nwere working with the Russians. And so, at the time, I didn't take it too seriously\nbecause I knew there was no truth to it. But it was amazing to me to\nstart seeing all of these institutions, whether it was\nCNN, The Washington Post, New York Times, these\nwere news organizations that I grew up having\na lot of respect for, taking these accusations so seriously, and then working themselves\nup in order to just cover it for two years. And then as a result, you\nhad a special counsel, you had a house investigation,\na senate investigation. And I personally spent\nabout, I think over 20 hours just testifying before\nthese different committees. Again, spent millions of\ndollars outta my own pocket on my legal fees to make\nsure I was well represented. And the reason I did that was\nbecause I saw in Washington, it was like a sick game, right? It's almost like, even though there was no underlying problems to the accusation, I felt like this is one of\nthose things where they're gonna try to catch you, and then\nif you step on the line, they catch you with one misrepresentation, they're gonna try to put you\nin jail or worst of, you know? And so for me, that was a big concern. So, you know, it was amazing. I mean, my poor mom, I told\nher to stop reading whatever. I said, \"Ma, I promise you,\nwe didn't do anything wrong, it's good.\" But, you know, she'd\ncall me and say, \"Well, our friends were on the Upper East Side we're talking with Chuck Schumer, says, \"Jared's going to jail. You know, know for sure that\nhe colluded with the Russians.\" And this is like a leading\nsenator saying things like this. And so it was just interesting\nfor me to see how the whole world could believe something\nand be talking about it that I knew with 1000%\ncertainty was just not true. And so seeing that play\nout was very, very hard. Obviously, you know, I was\naccused of a lot of things. There were times in\nWashington, I was radioactive. I remember one weekend, you\nknow, it was all over CNN. The people, they had panels on CNN, like the news organization\nthat I grew up thinking was, like, the number one trusted name for news in the world, talking about how I'd committed\ntreason because I met with an ambassador and said, \"We'd like to hear your\nperspective on what you think the policy should be in Syria,\" where there was a big civil\nwar happening and ISIS, and a lot of different things. So it was quite a crazy\ntime in that regard. But luckily, again, we were\nable to fight through it. It was a major distraction\nfor our administration, and I think we were able\nto kind of stay focused on the objectives and the policies. But it was a crazy time. And I learned a lot from that experience. - It's crazy how just an accusation can be viral and can just go. One of the things that worries\nme is the effect on your mind, the psychology of it, to make sure it doesn't make you cynical, like people that are trying to do stuff, those kinds of stories that\ncan destroy their mind. So one of the things I'd\nlove to sort of understand, you kind of rolled in\nfrom the business world, and all of a sudden, the\nentire world from CNN to everybody's accusing you of\ncolluding with the Russians. Like, when you're sitting at home, how do you keep a calm mind, a clear mind, an optimistic one that\ndoesn't become cynical, and actually just keep trying to push on, and do stuff in the world? - Yeah. So it was a surreal experience. I would say number one,\nis I felt very confident that I hadn't done anything wrong. I'd always tell my lawyer like, \"The good news is I've got\na good fact problem,\" right? Like, I need a good lawyer\nto get me through it. But it's much easier to be a\ngood lawyer if you have a very innocent client. And so the fact that I\nknew that I didn't believe that I had any legal liability, helped me kind of intellectually\nseparate the challenge I needed to do to fight\nthrough it from it. And then I just basically\nsaid like, you know, I'd had hardship earlier in\nmy life where I dealt with the situation with my father. And what I realized there is\nthat you can't really spend energy on the things\nthat you don't control. All you can do is spend your\ntime and energy worrying about what you can control and then\nhow you react to the things that you have there, and so\nit took a lot of discipline, it took a lot of strength. And again, I give my wife\nIvanka and, and even Donald, a lot of credit for, you know, for kind of having my\nback during that time, and encouraging me just to\nkind of fight through it. And then I also had to make\nsure that I didn't allow that to distract me from my job. I felt like I had an amazing\nopportunity in the White House to make a difference in the world. And if I would've spent all\nmy time playing defense, you know, in politics,\nit's a time duration game. In business, you have whatever duration you set for yourself. In politics, it's time duration. We had four years. Every day was sand through an hourglass. My mindset was I need to\naccomplish as much as I can in these four years. And I guess the traditional\ngame that's played in Washington is whether it's the media, the opposition, their job is to distract you\nand then try to stop you from being as successful as you want to be. And so just fought through\nit and wasn't always fun, but we got through and, and thank God, it's something people don't talk about. And it has been amazing to me just the lack of\nself-awareness and reflection of a lot of the people who\nhyped this up for two years. They don't think there was\nanything wrong with it. And that's interesting. But, you know, my view is we\ngot through it, it's good. So it's in the past, and then I started moving to\nthe future and that's really where I spend my time.\n- Yeah, but I wanna linger on it because to me, that has\na really discouraging effect on anyone who's trying to\ndo positive in the world. Like, these kinds of attacks are intense. - Yeah.\n- I mean, you you say kind of one\nof the lessons you learned is that you really have to be perfect. But I hate that to be the lesson. I feel like you should be\nable to do stupid stuff, take big risks, and people\ncelebrate the big risks, and not try to weave gigantic\nstories over nothing. I just wanna kind of understand\nthe two aspects of this, how not to have such\nstores have so much legs, and the other is how to\nstay psychologically strong. So you kind of waved it off\nthat you didn't have a fact problem, but it can just\nhave a effect in your psyche. You seem to be pretty stoic\nabout the whole thing, but how, I mean, just\non the psychology side, how did you stay calm\nand not become cynical, where you can continue to\ndo stuff and take big risks? - I didn't have a choice.\n- What do you mean? - I mean, I could have spent every day feeling sorry for myself or complaining, or saying things aren't fair. But the general way I looked\nat it was that in life, every opportunity has a cost. And, you know, you could look at it and say,\nmaybe this was a massive cost, either in dollars, or in\ntime, or in reputation, or an emotional drain. But you could also say that, you know, I had an opportunity to\nwork in the White House, and I had an opportunity to work on some of the hardest challenges. And you talk about how\nthat's not celebrated, that is something very\ndifferent in the private sector. When you take on big\nchallenges, that is celebrated. In government, when you\ntake on big challenges, people wanna see it fail or\nthey want to criticize those people who are trying to take that on. And I think that's wrong. And I think that as a country,\nwe should be thinking big, we should be dreaming big, and we should be encouraging\nour politicians to try, and to fail more, and to go\nand to take on big things, knowing that there's risk of failing. Obviously, we want them\nto succeed, not to fail, but let's take on the big\nthings, let's try to do that. So I think it's just very\nbasic that, you know, you're in a situation,\nI've made decisions. I can't go back and change\ndecisions in the past. I still felt very blessed to\nbe in the position I was in. And I knew that I just\nhad to work through it. And like I said, I was very\nlucky to have, you know, support from my wife, and from my family, and from good friends. Again, I think I'd\nchosen very good friends in life, and my friends were with me. I had one friend who, you know, my lowest moment, you\nknow, got on the plane, he lived in Arizona, got on a plane, and came just have dinner with me to say, \"Just pick your head up. I know you're down now,\nyou're gonna be fine. Just fight through.\" That meant a lot to me. And again, I always think\nin my life, you know, you don't learn as much\nfrom your successes. You don't learn as much\nfrom your high points. You learn the most about who\nyou wanna be and how the world works from your lowest moments. And at those lowest\nmoments, it made me better. And it taught me how to be a better friend to people who are in tough situations. And I tried to just get tougher, and I tried to just get\nbetter, and work through it."

      "text": "- Yeah. You said that you and Ivanka, this intense time\nbrought you two together, and helped you kind of\ndeal with the intensity of the chaos of it all. - So I think it was just number one, knowing that you had a partner\nand knowing that you had somebody who loved you\nand believed in you. I think that was definitely by\nfar the biggest of anything. - Love is the answer.\n- Love is very important. But then there's also a lot\nthat I've learned from her. Always getting me to read different books, or learn different things, which I love. But she's also, I think,\nan amazing role model. And I go through our time in Washington, where there were so many people who were, I thought\nvery nasty to her unfoundedly. And I'm not talking about\nindividually. 'cause again, you know, most people interacted\nwith her, were super kind. But I would see people, you know, on Twitter or different\nplaces go after her. And she always stayed elegant. I felt like that was something\nthat she never stooped down to a lower level, she kept\nher elegance the whole time. And she really went to\nWashington wanting to be a force of good. And I see all the time\nthat she follows her heart. She does what's right and\nshe has a very strong moral compass. And, and I feel very lucky\nto have her as a partner. And I respect her tremendously. - Yeah, she walks through the\nfire with grace, I would say. And she's recommended a\nbunch of amazing books to me. And she has an in an\nincredible, a fascinating mind. But one thing that jumped out\nto me is you both love diners, Jersey Diners. So I lived in Philly for a while. And I traveled quite a bit. And traveling from Boston\ndown to Philly, maybe to DC. You can drive through Jersey. There's something about Jersey, I dunno what it is.\n- It's the best. - You listen to Bruce Springsteen. Lucy K has this bit where, I think it's part of\ncriticizing cell phones today, where people are too much on their phone. They don't just sit there, be bored, but he's uses that story to\ntell where he's just driving, and Bruce Springsteen's song comes on, and he just wants to pull\nover to the side of the road, and just like weep for\nno unexplainable reason. And I think that's true,\n'cause life is difficult. Life is full of suffering,\nor struggle, or challenges. Sometimes, it's always Bruce Springsteen, but some kind of song like\nthis can really make you reflect on life, that melancholy feeling. But that melancholy\nfeeling is the other side of the happiness coin, where if you just allow\nyourself to feel that pain, you can also feel the highest joys. That's the sort of the\npoint Lucy came makes. And there's something about\nJersey with the diners, often late at night. There's several diner\nexperiences, I should say. Okay. There's like the family friendly, there's a nice waitress,\nand there's a sweetness, a kindness, like, \"Hello,\nsweetheart,\" that kind of thing. There's also like the 3:00 AM diner, the ones that are open 24 hours, that has a romantic element\nwhen you're a young man or young woman, you're traveling,\nthe loneliness of that. It's all of it. The American diner is like\nfrom like Jack Kerouac on, represents something, I'm\nnot sure what that is, but it's like a real beautiful experience. And the food itself too.\n- Always fresh, yeah. The thing with diners, there's so much to love about it. When I grew up, obviously, in New Jersey, when I'd go with my father to\nbusiness, he'd always stop. We'd eat at a diner. Late night, I'd be come\nback with my friends, we'd stop at a diner. And it's a tradition that Ivanka and I had loved doing as well. And I think there's a notion of, it's very egalitarian in that, you know, people from all places are there. You could order basically\nwhatever you want. I mean, the, the menus at the diners look like the phone book.\n- That's great. - And it's amazing how they keep so much fresh ingredients to do it. At least the good ones do. I'd love as a jersey guy,\nyou get mozzarella stick, and an omelet, at any hour of the day, 'cause most of 'em are open 24 hours. And that's basically\nmy Ivanka and my go-to, we'll throw in a milkshake or two as well. Nice.\n- But for me as a kid, you know, my father would take me, sometimes I'd sit with him in the meeting, sometimes I'd be at the table next to him. He'd give me a bunch of quarters to put in the music machine that\nthey would have on the wall. And it was always just a great experience doing it in Jersey. And I joke that, you know,\nif you grow up in Jersey, you grow up with just enough\nof a chip on your shoulder that you have to go and make\nsomething of yourself in life. It's a special place. I had an amazing childhood there, and very, very proud to be from the state. And I will just give a\nlittle bit of a plug now, because the state has now\nactually turned the corner, and they had a $10 billion\nbudget surplus for many years. You know, it was a state\nthat was basically bankrupt, and now actually under a\npretty progressive Democrat, governor Phil Murphy, he's turned the state around\nand it's actually has a very bright future ahead. And it's probably one of the best places to raise a family in the country, right? It's got very low crime, one of the best public school\nsystems in the country. Pretty good healthcare\nsystem, a lot of green parks. People know the turnpike,\nbut it's got a lot to it. That's really great. So I'm a big, big fan of Jersey. - I like how this is a first\nfor this particular podcast, you literally gave a plug to a state. So New Jersey, everybody. - [Jared] It's where it's at. - There's South Jersey,\nthere's North Jersey. I mean there all, there's\nall kinds of jerseys too. I mean, the whole thing, it just, I- - [Jared] And don't get me started on the \"Jersey Shore,\" Lex. - \"Jersey Shore\" is a whole thing- - And I'm not talking\nabout the Snooki part, I'm talking about the real nice parts, where there's great food, great people. - What do you mean, nice parts? It's all beautiful. The full range of human\ncharacters that are in New Jersey are all beautiful.\n- I agree with that. - And every time I\ntravel across the world, there's always to meet\nsome from New Jersey, and you kind of give a\nnod of deep understanding. It's the cradle of civilization many ways. So, back, I don't know how we got there. Oh, all right. Going back to the low points."

      "section": "Father",
      "text": "You mentioned your father, if\nwe could just return there. Even just the personal\nstory of your father, that you write about that, of the betrayal that happened\nin his life and then how he responded to that betrayal and\nhe was after that arrested. Can you just tell the story? - Sure. So my father is an amazing person, and we grew up in New Jersey. My father was a big developer, a great entrepreneur,\nbuilt an amazing business. He got into a dispute\nwith two of his siblings. And through that dispute, they basically took all of\nthe documents in his company, went to the US attorney's office, and turned into, from a civil dispute into a real public dispute. My father did something\nwrong in that process. And when he got arrested for that, he basically said, \"You know what? What I did was wrong.\" And he, he took his medicine\nand he did it like a man. And he said, \"I'm gonna go to prison.\" And he did that for a year. And so for me that was\na very challenging time in the family, obviously. You know, it was a shock. It was a total change. I grew up, my childhood was I think a very nice childhood. You know, my parents always\nsaid, \"Do good in school. Work hard.\" I was very, very focused on my athletics. I was captain of the basketball team, captain of the hockey team. I ran a marathon with my father, and it was always about pursuing. Went to Harvard, graduated with honors, and I was in NYU pursuing a law degree, and a business degree. And I was working at the\nManhattan District Attorney's office at the time, actually thinking I wanted\nto go into public service. 'cause my father always taught us, we were always surrounded by politicians. And he always said, you know,\n\"My parents came to America. They lived in the land of\nopportunity and they had these opportunities because\nthis is the best country in the world. And so you should be\nsuccessful, work hard, don't ever let your opportunities\nbecome your disadvantages, because you have advantages in life. You have to work harder.\" And that's what he instilled\nin myself and my brother. And he always pushed us to\nmake the most of ourselves. And when we did that, you know, everything changed overnight\nwhen my father got arrested. Obviously, it's very\nembarrassing for a family when you're on the front\npage of the papers. I would see the newspapers\nwriting all these things about my father that I didn't think were\nrepresentative of the person that I knew. It was a big change for our family. And, you know, I was angry. I was angry. I said, you\nknow, I could be angry at the prosecutor. I could be angry at my father's brother. I could be angry at my father's lawyers. I could be angry at my father\nfor making this mistake. And then I kind of said, that's\nnot gonna change anything. And I had a real shift. I do think that that was a\nturning point in my life, where I basically said, let me focus on the things I can control, Let me focus on the\npositive things I can do, and from that moment forward, I said, \"How can I be a great son to my father? How could I be a great older\nbrother slash substitute father for my two sisters and my younger brother? How could I be there for my mother? How could I be there for\nmy father's business?\" And I just went into battle mode. And I put my armor on and I\njust, you know, ran into it. And for the next two years,\nit was, every day was painful. I mean, I was dealing with banks. The company still had subpoenas.\nI was still in law school. I did tell my father I wanted\nto drop out of law school and business school, but\nhe said, \"Please don't.\" So I would basically go to\nlaw school one day a week or maybe I'd skip it most days. And I'd go to his office every day. And my friends would joke\nthat if my professors wanted to fail me, the law professor\nwould have to gimme a test that had four pictures and say, \"Circle who your professor is,\" you know? But I would basically take a week off, I'd read the books, and I did\nwell, and I got my degrees. And it was just a very,\nvery challenging time. But like I said to you before\nis that you learn the most about life and you learn\nthe most about humanity, and yourself when you're in\nyour most challenging periods. And I'll say that, you know,\nthat experience also changed the people I interacted with, spending weekends with my\nfather down in a prison in Alabama, I met the other inmates, I met their families. I spent time then trying to\nadvise the children of other people who were going\nthrough the same experience that I'd gone through on how\nto navigate it correctly. And you just learn a lot about the world. And you see that in life, everything could get taken from you, your status, your money, your friends. I saw that certain people were\nvery disloyal to my father at the time, who he thought were friends. It was only a handful. But again, I learned from those people, how can I be a true friend to people? How can I be better? And I learned a tremendous\namount through that experience. - You're right, that your father told\nyou about being humble. I'd love to ask you about this, that in life sometimes you get so powerful that we start to think we're\nthe dealers of our own fate. We're not the dealers, God is the dealer. Sometimes we have to be brought\nback down to earth to get perspective on what is really important. What do you think he meant by that? What did you learn from that experience? - The way I interpreted at\nthe time, and those were very, very memorable words. After I picked up my father\nfrom the arraignment, I drove him down, I drove the car. And my father and I are very, very close. And he didn't say a\nword for the whole time. I think he was processing, number one, what was happening to him,\nand I couldn't even imagine. But I actually think\nthe bigger pain for him, because my father is such a\ncommitted person to the family, is like, \"Did I let my family down? Did I let my kids down?\" And I do think he felt that that moment, like his life was over. He couldn't really see past\nwhat this challenge was gonna bring and if there would\nbe a life for him after it. So I could see that he had a lot of fear, and he really wasn't saying much. And then I didn't know what to do. And so I just stood by\nhim and stood close. And, you know, later that\nday, or the next day, he got up and started walking. He had an ankle monitor\nfor whatever reason, the prosecutor was such a, so aggressive, he was a flight risk. So they made him wear an ankle monitor. They were very, very aggressive and nasty. And at the time, my father\nwas the biggest donor to Democrats. The prosecutor was a Republican. It was a very political thing. And what happened was, is he was walking around the\npool and I just started walking with him and he said to\nme, \"You know, Jared, in life, sometimes we get\nso powerful that we believe that we're the dealer.\" He says, \"But we're not the dealer. God's the dealer. And we have to come down\nto earth to understand,\" like you said. So what what I took from\nthat was that my father, with all of his success,\nhad started to believe that maybe certain rules\ndidn't apply to him. And I think that that's\nwhere he made a mistake. And I think he had a lot of\nregret that he made the mistake. And you know, my father\nis a very humble person. He's a very moral person. You know, for me, with my humility, my brother and I joke that\nwe give our credit for being humble, number one, to being Mets fans. Because every year you\nhave a lot of promise, and then it never ends up paying off. Although now with Steve Cohen, hopefully we're on a different trajectory. But the other thing is\nalso our mother, you know, our mother really raised\nus to be very humble. We knew we had a lot, but every Sunday morning\nmy mom was there clipping the coupons. The cereal we ate in\nour house was based on, it was based on what was on\nsale versus what we liked. You know, when we would have a problem with our teachers in school and I'd say, \"Well, teacher doesn't like me. She'd say, \"Well, I'm not calling them. It's your job to make\nthe teacher like you.\" And so my mother gave us a lot of that. My father gave us a lot of the grounding. And I think during that time, my father was just realizing\nthat maybe he had gotten disconnected from the\ngrounding and the values. And again, I think he also accepted maybe he could have blamed others for acting inappropriately. But I respect the fact that\nhe took responsibility himself and said, \"I can't control\nthe actions of other people. I can't control what they\ndo is right and wrong. I can just control my actions.\" And as I go on the next\njourneys in my life, and I go to government,\nI go to Washington. I mean, I even think through the craziness of going from visiting\nmy father in a prison, to 10 years later sitting in\nthe office in the White House next to the President\nof the United States. And like, I think about\nthat story and that it's a story that only God could write. And I really believe you\nhave to have a lot of faith, because the lows and the\nhighs are both so extreme and unbelievable that I\nfeel like those low moments in some ways allowed me\nto keep my grounding, and to understand what was\ntruly important in life for when I ended up going\nthrough those other moments."

      "text": "- Your father was betrayed,\nperhaps over money by siblings. Is there some deeper wisdom\nyou can draw from that? Have you seen money or perhaps power cloud people's judgment? - Oh, 100%. 100%. - Is there some kind of\noptimistic thing you can take from that about human nature of\nhow to escape that clouding of judgment when you're\ntalking about leaders, when you're talking about\ngovernment, even business, because you mentioned there's\na power dynamics at play always when you're negotiating. Is there a way to see the common humanity, and not see the sort of will\nto power in the whole thing? - Definitely. You know, you mentioned about\npower, money corrupting. There's a great quote I\nheard a friend of mine say, he's a guy, Michael Harris, who was one of the founders\nof Death Row Records. He was being interviewed\nrecently and they asked him about what happened with Suge Knight. And his line was, \"Money\njust makes you more of what you already are,\" which I thought was a very\nelegant way of saying it. And I would see this time and\ntime again in the White House, where you had people who\nwere now given a lot of responsibility and power\nand it went to their head, and they acted very crazily, and maybe didn't act in a way that I thought was always\nconducive to the objectives. So I think it's a very\nbig problem that you have, whether it's something that's solvable. I think it's about\nhaving the right leaders, and hopefully for the\nleaders, having good friends. I mean, I'm still friends with a lot of the people I interacted with when I was in government and you know, the number one thing I try to be to them is just a good friend. I try to be somebody who they\ncan talk about things with. I don't go in trying to tell\nthem what to do on different things and I think that\nthat's a big thing, is that people just need friends, and they need conversation,\nand if they have that, then hopefully that allows\nthem to keep their head in the right place. - I think this is a good place to ask about one aspect of the\nfascinating work you've done, which is on prison reform. Can you take me through\nyour journey of helping the Bipartisan Bill get passed, just working on prison reform\nin the White House in general, how you made that happen, how\nyou help make that happen? - Sure. So we passed a law called\nthe First Step Act, which was the largest prison\nand criminal justice reform bill that's been done maybe\nin 30, 40, 50 years in the US. And so what it basically\ndid was two things. Number one, is it took the\nprison system and it took a certain class of offenders\nand allowed them to become eligible for earlier release\nif they go through the certain trainings that will allow them\nto have a lower probability of going back. So, you know, stepping back, you look at the prison system,\nyou say, \"What's the purpose? Is it to punish? Is it to warehouse? Is it to rehabilitate?\" And I do think that, we're\na country that believes in second chances. I saw firsthand when my father\nwas a client of the system, how inefficient it was and\nhow much better it could be. And you know, when my father got out, we didn't run from that experience. He started hiring people\nfrom Rikers Island, and different prisons into the company, into a second chance program, which we're very, very proud of doing. And what we saw through our\nmicro experience was that if you give people mentorship, if\nyou give 'em job training. A lot of people leave,\nthey have addiction issues, and they can't find housing. And so people leave prison\nwith a criminal record, and they're less likely to go back. and reintegrate in society without help from different institutions\nthat can help them do that. So we modeled the reforms\nof what they did in Texas, and Georgia, and other states where they basically put\na lot of job training, alcohol and addiction treatment\nprograms in the prisons as a way to incentivize the prisoners to work on themselves while they're there in order to allow them to reenter society. It's turned out to be\nvery successful so far. They just had a report that\nshowed that the general population has had a 47% recidivism rate, meaning that people who\nleave federal prison, half of 'em go back. And people who have\nnow taken this program, only 12% of them go back. So number one, you're\nmaking communities safer, because if people are gonna now get a job, and enter society instead\nof committing future crimes, you're avoiding future crimes. And number two, you're giving people a second chance at life. And so that was the first part of it. The second thing we did was, there was a rule passed\nin the '90s that basically penalized crack cocaine at 100 times the penalty of what regular cocaine was. And I think a lot of the motivations, what people say in retrospect\nwas that crack was more of a black drug drug and cocaine\nwas more of a white drug. And so there was a really racial\ndisparity in terms of what the application of these sentences were. So they then revised that\nto make it 18 to one. And what we did in this\nbill is we allowed it to go retroactive to allow people\nwho were in prison with sentences under the, what we\nthought was the racist law to be able to make an application to a judge in order to be dismissed. And it was based on\ngood behavior, you know, being rehabilitated and the\nfact that they would have a low probability of offending in the future. And so that was really the meat of it. And there was a couple other\nthings in there we did as well, which were also quite good. So we did it. Worked very closely with the Democrats, Republicans to do it. At first, President Trump was\na little bit skeptical of it, because he's a big strong\nlaw and order supporter, but he made me work very hard\nto put together a coalition of Republicans and Democrats,\nand law enforcement. We had the support from the the policemen. We had the support from\nthe ACLU, and ultimately, we were able to get it together, and it was an amazing thing. We ended up getting 87\nvotes in the Senate. You know, this happened for me at a time, it was while the Russia\ninvestigation stuff was still happening, new chief of\nstaff came in, John Kelly, he basically marginalized\nme in the operations. So I had kind of less\nday-to-day responsibilities in the White House. And so for me, this effort became one of my full-time efforts along with negotiating the Mexico trade deal, and along with the Middle East efforts. And the reason why that was\ngreat was because it didn't have a lot of support from the\nRepublican caucus originally, and people thought there\nwas no way it would happen. So I really was able to\nbe the chief executive, the middle executive, the\nlow executive, the intern. And through that process, I really got an education\non how congress works, on how to pass legislation.\nI was negotiating text, I was negotiating back and forth, and I built a lot of trust. Again, I would deal with,\nwhether it's Hakeem Jeffries, or Cedric Richmond, that\nwe built a lot of trust. We'd speak three times a day. These guys had my back, the, the ACLU. Again, I never thought they were suing our administration every day, or every other day on something. But for whatever reason, we built trust, and we were able to work together, and then also with the\nreal conservative groups, because there was a lot, a big\npart of the conservative base that felt like we should be\ngiving people a second chance. And in addition to that,\nthis will keep our country safer, and it'll reduce the cost of what we spend on prisons. And so it was a great\neffort and I was very, very proud that we're able to get it done under President Trump. - How'd you con convince the Republicans, so they were skeptical at first? Are we talking about like\njust phone conversations, going out to lunch? Just back to the emojis or what? - Hand-to-hand combat, meetings. The cool thing about this,\nso everyone always says, I always get frustrated when\nI hear a lawmaker say, \"Oh, the Senate's not what it used to be,\" or, \"Congress isn't what it used to be. Things are broken today.\" I don't think that's true. I think, you know, going\nthrough the process, I think that our founders were totally genius in the way\nthat they designed our system of government. And what I saw is you just have\nto work it so everyone knows the power of their vote. Some would give it to me easily, some wouldn't give it to me easily. Some would trade it for other things, some would withhold it\nbecause they were pissed about other things, and it was just hand-to-hand combat. So it was just making\ncalls, using the phone, walk in the halls, going\nto lunches, you know, hosting dinners at my house. It was a nonstop lobbying effort. And by the way, it was\nalso adjudicating issues and making people feel\nlike they were heard, hearing their issues, and then trying to find\nsolutions that you don't put something in that then tips\noff where you lose, you know, a whole coalition. So it was really a balancing act. But it's an amazing thing, and worked very closely\non that with Van Jones and Jessica Jackson, who also gave me a lot\nof help on the left. And it was an amazing\nthing, had a great team too. - You mentioned the importance of trust"

      "section": "Trust and betrayal",
      "text": "at the very beginning of the conversation. From the outsider perspective,\njust maybe a dark question, which is like how much trust\nis there in Washington, to the flip side of that, how much backstabbing is there? Can you form like long-term\nrelationships with people on a basic human level where\nyou know you're not going to be betrayed, screwed over,\nmanipulated for, again, going back to the old money and power? - The answer is yes, and the answer is no. So I made some incredible friends, lifelong friends through\nmy time in Washington. But the way I think\nabout it from politics, and I think in geopolitics as well is I would say that\npoliticians really don't have friends, politicians have interests. And as long as you kind\nof follow that rule, you should be able to know\nhow to rate where your relationship with a given\nperson falls in the spectrum. But I do think I was the exception. I did make some tremendous\nfriends, and again, I'd go back to what I said\nabout negotiation where, you know, when you're in a situation where there's really nothing in it for any of you personally, but you're in a foxhole together\nand nobody in Washington can get anything done by themselves. So you have people coming from\nall different backgrounds, all different experiences, all different geographies coming together, agreeing on an objective, creating a plan, and then every day rowing\ntogether in order to get it done. It's a beautiful thing\nand you really learn what people are about. And so when you go through\nan experience like that, you learn who's in it for themselves. You learn who's in it for\nthe cause and you know, for every, thing you read\nabout in the press of a fight I had with somebody\nbecause we were at odds, you know, I have about 100 people who have become lifelong friends, because I respect the way\nthat when we were under fire together, they got better, they were competent and\nthey were there to serve for the right reason. And so, I guess the answer is yes. It is possible. You have to be careful because\nthere are a lot of mercurial people there. I always say the politicians\nare like gladiators. I didn't have as much respect\nfor politicians till I got there, but if you think about it, everyone who's got a congressional\nseat or a Senate seat, there's 25 people back at\nhome who want their job, who think they're smarter\nthan them who are trying to back stab them. And so I always say that\nthe political dynamic, it's like in the private\nsector you're standing on flat ground, you choose\nwhich fights you take on, when you take them on, how you fight them. In politics, it's like\nyou're standing on a ball and what you have to realize\nis that there's maybe, like, 10 things that you have to do, but there's a potential\ncost to taking on each one that might destabilize you. You fall off the ball and\nthen you lose your opportunity to pursue those. You have to always be kind of\nmarking everything to market and going through your\ncalculations to make sure you can accomplish what you want to\nwithout falling off the ball, and losing your opportunity\nto make a difference. - I guess people like power, and I just feel like to\nbe a good politician, you should be willing, like\ngood meaning good for humanity, be willing to let go of power, you know, try to do the right thing. If there's somebody back home\nthat does manipulative stuff, screws you over and takes\npower from you, it's okay. I feel like that kinda humility is required to be a great leader. And I feel like that's actually\na good way to have long-term power because karma has\na viral aspect to it, just doing good by others, I feel like. - I'd like to say that's true, Lex. I think it's just way more complicated. I mean, you look what happened this week with Kevin McCarthy, right? He did what he thought was morally right. He thought he did a bipartisan deal. He was told that, you know, they would have his\nback, and then the moment things got tough, they,\nthey cut him loose. So again, I don't know if\nthat was the right thing or the wrong thing, right? I've also seen leaders\non the other end say, \"I'm gonna do things that\nare short term more selfish,\" but the way they justify\nto themselves is to say, \"I believe that myself staying in power is existential to the greater good. So I will do things that maybe\nare not in the greater good now because I believe that\nmy maintaining power is,\" and so it's complicated. In an idealized world, I'd love to believe that's the case, but it's just way more\ncomplicated than that. - Yeah. Yeah.\n- I wish it wasn't, but it is. - Yeah. I do just wish people zoomed out, and people in politics zoomed out a bit, and just asked themselves, \"What are we all doing this for?\" Like, sometimes, you can\nget like a little bit lost in the game of it. If you zoom out, you realize\nlike integrity is way more important than like\nlittle gains in money or little gains in power in the long term. So when you look at yourself in the mirror at the end of the day, and\nalso how history remembers you. I just feel like people do some dark stuff when they're like in that moment when they're losing power\nand they try to hold on a little too hard. This is when they can\ndo really dark things, like bring out the worst in themselves. And it is just sad to see,\nand I wish there was a kind of machinery of government\nwould inspire people to be their best selves in their last days versus their worst selves, right? - When that system gets\ninvented, you'll share with me what it is. But, look, let me give you\nanother way to frame it, which is, and this was\nkind of the revelation we spoke before about, you know, kind of when I\nwas getting my butt kicked by the Russian investigation\nand all the different areas, but kind of the basic framework\nI looked at was I said, \"Okay, you know, this all feels tough.\" But I said, \"The game's, the game. The game's been here way longer, way before I came, and it'll\nbe here way long after I leave. And so I have two choices. I can complain that the\ngame's tough, it's not fair, it's not moral. Or I can go and I can try to play the game as hard as possible.\" And I think that there's\ntwo different things, right? You have people who are willing\nto kind of sit in the stands and they're willing to\nyell at the players, or make their points known. Or you have people who\nare willing to suit up, and get in the arena, and go play. And I have a lot of respect for the people who suit up and go play. And, again, some of 'em, you know, I wish they would\nplay for different means, but the fact that they're\nwilling to put their name on the ballot, make the sacrifice and go put on the pads, and get hit, and hit others, I think that you need those people. And I wish more people who had\nmaybe the moral wiring that you discussed would be putting\non a helmet and going to play, 'cause it's hard, it's hard. - I agree with you. I just would love to fix the aspect of the Russia collusion,\naccusation, the virality, the power of that, because that's a really\ndiscouraging thing for people. Maybe it's the way it has to be, but it's seems like a disincentive\nto people to participate. - It it is, but I'll give you again, a an optimistic side of\nit is that, you know, what you're seeing now with\nsocial media is I do think, with what's happening\nat X there is now more of a reversion towards\nmore egalitarian, right? And egalitarianism of information. And so for many years the media\npublications were the gate holders, they were the gatekeepers. And then you had these social\nmedia companies that grew, they became so powerful, but then they were tilting the scales. Why they were doing it, you know, we can go through\nlong explanations for that, but if there truly is a real\nforum and a democratization of information, then you would think that the\nmarketplace of ideas would surface the real ones and\ndiscredit the non-real ones. And I think that as a society\nwe're starting to kind of come to grips with the fact that\nthe power dynamic is changing, and that some of these\ninstitutions that we used to have a lot of faith in don't deserve our faith. And some of them, you know, will actually reform and\nmaybe re-earn our faith. So I think that there could\nbe an optimistic tone. Again, the years of Trump, I think that, you know, he was an outsider and you know, he represented something\nthat was existential to the system, right? You think about for the 30 years before, you were either part\nof the Clinton dynasty, or the Bush dynasty, I think a lot of people in the\ncountry felt like that whole class, whether you wearing\na red shirt or a blue shirt, wasn't representing them. And Trump represented a true\noutsider to that system. And I do think that as he went in there, there was a lot of norms that\nwere broken to try to stop him from changing the\ntraditional power structure. So I think that we're at a time\nwhere maybe there will be an optimistic breakthrough where\nyou'll have institutions that will allow for a lot more\ntransparency into what truth really is."

      "section": "Mohammed bin Salman",
      "text": "- I'd love to go back and talk\nto you about the Middle East 'cause there's so many\ninteresting components to this. Let's talk about Saudi Arabia. And first let me ask you about\nMBS, Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince. So you've gotten to know him pretty well, you've become friends with him. What's he like as a human being, just on a basic human\nlevel, what's he like? - So for the listeners, Mohammed bin Salman is now the\nCrown Prince of Saudi Arabia. He has risen to that position\nover the last couple of years and he's been a tremendous\nreformer for the country. He's gone in and he's really\nmodernized the economy. He's put a lot more\ninvestment into the country. He's marginalized the religious\npolice and he's really done a good job to bring\nmodernization, a lot of reform. So he's been a great reformer. What he's like as a person\nis, he's very high energy. He's got tremendous candle\npower, very, very smart, incredibly well read. When he was younger, his father\nwould give him a book a week and make him report on it on the weekend. He was trained as a leader\nand as a politician, really by his father,\nhe's not western educated. So he grew up in the Saudi\nculture and he's a real Saudi nationalist. He loves their history,\nloves their heritage, has a steep understanding of the tribal nature of the region. And you know, his father was actually known\nto be a tremendous politician. So when he was governor of Riyadh, people who I speak to today\nabout him say that if they had a full election, he\nwould've won in a landslide. They say every time somebody\nwent to the hospital, he was the first person to call. Anytime there was a funeral, he was the first person to show up. He's a very, very beloved leader. Muhammed, bin Salman, he was a businessman before he got into Crown Prince. So he thinks really with\na business mindset about how he runs the country. And he's brought I think a\ndifferent mindset and energy to the Middle East. You know, one thing I'll say\nthat maybe that comes to mind here is that I remember\nearly on talking with him about all the different\ninitiatives he was taking on. He's building a big city\ncalled Neo in the desert, in a place where there really\nwas nothing on the Red Sea. And a lot of people were\ncriticizing the ambition of the plan. And I was sitting with\nhim one night and I said, \"Why are you taking on all these things? You know, you've got a\nlot of different programs, but you know what most\npoliticians do is they set lower expectations and then they\nexceed the expectations.\" And he looked at me without hesitation. He says, \"Jared, you know, the way I look at it is\nthat in five years from now, if I set five goals and\nI achieve five goals, I'll achieved five things. If I set 100 goals and\nI fail at 50 of 'em, th in IN five years, I'll\naccomplish 50 things. And so it's a very different\nmindset as a leader. The way I got to work\nwith him was Saudi Arabia was a big topic in the campaign. President Trump was basically\nsaying during the campaign they've gotta pay for their fair share. They haven't been a great\npartner in the region. He's very critical of Saudi. And then during the transition, I was asked by several friends\nto meet with a representative of Saudi Arabia. I said, \"I don't wanna meet with them.\" But I came over and I\nmet and they said, \"Well, we wanna make changes.\" And I said, \"Well, you\nhave to make changes, to how you treat women.\" Then, women couldn't drive,\nthey had guardianship laws. I said, \"You gotta start\nworking with Israel. You have to be paying\nmore of your fair share, and you have stopping the Wahhabism that that's being spread. And again, I'd no knowledge, these were just kind of the\ntraditional talking points about Saudi Arabia. So the guy I was with basically\nsaid is a guy fa Alto, he's a very respected minister there. \"Jared,\" he says, \"You don't know much about\nSaudi Arabia, do you?\" I said, \"No, no, I don't.\" It's just really what I\nreally I've kind of been told or what I read. And he says, \"Okay, lemme do this. We wanna be great allies with America. We've traditionally been\ngreat allies with America. Can I come back to you with a\nproposal on ways that we can make progress on all of the\ndifferent areas where we have joint interests?\" And keep in mind at that point in time, the Middle East was a mess. And probably the single\nbiggest issue we had after ISIS was the ideological battle. If you remember in 2016, there was the Pulse nightclub\nshooting in Orlando, you had the San Bernardino\nshooting and people were being radicalized online with the extremism. And then there was a\nlot of crimes that were happening because of that. And it was a big topic in the campaign. And so that when I was\nthinking about, you know, talking to different generals\nand what capabilities the US had to really combat the\nextremism and the ideological battle, what we realized\nwas that Saudi Arabia IS the custodian of the\ntwo holiest sites in Islam, the Mecca Medina, that that would be the best\npartner to work with if they were willing to. But, for years, they\nreally hadn't been willing to kind of lean into this fight. So I said, sure, give a proposal. So they come back, give a\nproposal, and they said, \"Look, if you make President Trump's\nfirst trip to Saudi Arabia, we will do all these different things. We'll increase our military\nspending and cooperation, we'll counter all the terror financing.\" Unbelievable layer. So I took the proposal,\nI went to the national, then, it was General Flynn. I said, \"If Saudi Arabia did these things, would this be considered a big deal?\" \"Unbelievable, but it'll never happen.\" I said, \"Well, they're\ntelling me they wanna do these things.\" Again, I having no\nforeign policy experience, I'm just saying I've got\nsomebody telling me they want do it, and that's kind of where we started. We get into office, I don't\nthink much more about it. And then I think it was like\na maybe a month in President Trump has a call with King Salman, and before the call,\nwe're in the Oval Office, and the president's basically saying, well, you know, this is\nwhat we want to go through. And I have Secretary Mattis\nand Secretary Tillerson, the Minister of Defense\nand the Secretary of State basically saying, you have to deal with MBN. MBN is is the guy who's been our partner for all these years. He's the head of intelligence\nand he's been a great partner. I said, \"Well, if he's\nbeen a great partner, then why do we have all\nthese problems that you guys are complaining about with Saudi?\" I said, \"I've been told\nthat we have this proposal from MBS who's the Deputy Crown Prince, and that's who we should\nbe dealing with on this. And so the phone call starts\nand President Trump listened to both of us. And on the phone call with King Salman, President Trump says, \"Okay, we'll go through all these things. These are the things we want to get done.\" And he says, \"Well, who\nshould we deal with? And King Salman says, \"Deal with my son, the\nDeputy Crown Prince, MBS.\" And so President Trump said on the phone, \"Have him deal with Jared,\" because I think he knew\nthat if he would've put him with the other guys, they\nwere not believers in what he had the ability to do. And that's how I got\nassigned to work with him. I get back to my office after\nthat, have an email from him, spoke to him for the first time, and then we just went to work. And, you know, a lot of\npeople were betting against that trip. They thought it wasn't\ngonna be successful. And they've been betting\nagainst him and he's been underestimated, but he's\nbeen doing an incredible job. And the whole Middle\nEast is different today, because of the work that he's done. - Maybe it's instructive to\ngo through the mental journey that you went on from\nlike the talking points, the basic narratives, the\nvery basic talking points, understanding of Saudi\nArabia to making that human connection with MBS, and\nmaking the policy connection that it's actually\npossible to solve problems. What was that journey like? Why was it so difficult to take\nfor others, and why were you effective in being able to\ntake that journey yourself? - Maybe some of it came\nfrom my inexperience, but my desire to listen and hear people. So, you know, I had this proposal, I was told that all of\nthese things were good, then we're trying to schedule\nthis trip and the National Security Council calls\na meeting where we're in the situation room\nand we have, you know, Homeland Security, Secretary\nof Defense, Secretary of State, and everyone's saying \"This\nis gonna be a disaster.\" They said, \"If we go to Saudi Arabia, the Saudis never keep their promises.\" And our Secretary of State at\nthe time was a gentleman named Rex Tillerson, who'd been CEO of Exxon. So he dealt with all these\nplay people very extensively. And he basically said, \"In my experience, the Saudis won't come through, and Jared, you don't know what you're\ndoing, you're wasting your time.\" And I basically was at a point\nwhere I said, \"Look, guys, but they're saying they\nwant to do all these things, shouldn't we at least give\nhim a chance to try to do it?\" Why do we want to\npredetermine their direction by not giving them a chance to change? Just because things in the\npast haven't gotten the way you want them to, that doesn't mean they can't\ngo that way in the future. So we fought the battle, you know, they basically deferred and,\nand let me go through with it, but when I do the planning\nmeetings for the trip, nobody would show up because\nthey all thought it was gonna be an absolute disaster. And by the way, they probably\nweren't wrong to think that, 'cause I'd never planned\na foreign trip before, and I'd never done any\nforeign policy before. So during the planning, I'd speak to MBS, almost every day, and I'd go through all\nthe different details, and the things that would be\ncoming up and I said, \"Look, I really need to get\nthese things in writing.\" He sent over a guy, Dr. Musaad Al Aiban, who's a tremendous diplomat for them. And he came to Washington,\nstayed for three weeks, and we worked through\nall the different details of what we needed and we ended up coming to an arrangement on what it should be. So, you know, I think about now in retrospect\nwhy I was so focused on getting things like this done, and why I even believed\nthat they could be possible. But the answer is, it's really the people I was\ntalking to on the other end were telling me that these\nthings were possible. And so just because they hadn't\nbeen done before and just because others around me didn't\nbelieve that they could be done, I wasn't willing to just\nsay, \"Well, let's not try.\" - It just seems like that cynicism that takes over is paralyzing. And now you send me a great\nessay from, from Paul Graham, I'm a big fan of, that I think explains\na lot of your success. The essay is called\n\"How to Do Great Work,\" and people should go\ndefinitely read the full essay. There's a few things I could read from it. Some quotes, \"Having new ideas is a strange\ngame because it usually consists of seeing things that\nwere right under your nose. Once you've seen a new idea,\nit tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this before? Seeing something obvious sounds easy, and yet empirically\nhaving new ideas is hard.\" The steps you took seem trivial, and yet nobody was taking\nthem, or at least in the past, they weren't successful. So the successes you've had\nwere as simple as essentially picking up the phone or trying. - [Jared] Mm-hm. - There's a lot of interesting\nthings here to talk about. This aspect of doing the\nseemingly simple that seems to be so hard to do, it, as Paul describes, \"Requires a willingness to break rules. There are two ways to be\ncomfortable breaking rules, to enjoy breaking them and\nto be indifferent to them.\" That's an interesting distinction. \"I call these two cases being\naggressively and passively independent minded.\" So again, that's to enjoy breaking the rules, or to be indifferent to the rules. \"The aggressively independent-minded\nare the naughty ones. Rules don't merely fail to stop them. Breaking rules gives\nthem additional energy. For this sort of person delight\nat the sheer of audacity of a project sometimes applies enough activation energy\nto get it started. The other way to break the\nrules is not to care about them at all or perhaps even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries. Their ignorance of a field,\nignorance may be in quotes, but a field's assumptions\nact as a source of temporary, passive, independent mindedness. Aspies also seem to\nhave a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs. Several I know say that this\nhelps them to have new ideas. So the aggressive and the passive\nis such an interesting way of looking at it. Perhaps some aspect of this, at least in the story you\ntell this some passive aspect where you're like not even acknowledging, not even caring that there was rules, just kinda asking the simple question, and taking the simple action. - That was an essay I read, and we're doing just a snippet of it, but I would encourage anyone\nlistening to go and find it, and read the entire thing because\nit's something that really spoke to me as I was transitioning\ninto my new career now, and I just loved it. But when we were talking about\nwhy certain people who don't have traditional qualifications\nare able to come in, and do incredible work,\nand solve complex problems, it made me think of that essay,\nwhich is why I shared it. And I think that in the context\nof the work that I was doing here, perhaps not having\nthe historical context became an advantage, and\nobviously, went back, and then tried to study it. But you know, if you go into a problem, I always find that, especially\nin the political realm, my favorite political\nissues are ones where they're contrarian by being obvious. And you know, sometimes\nthey feel very intuitive, and so you take them on. There's always a lot of\nresistance when you go against something that's been accepted as the way that you're supposed to do things. And I came to learn over the\ncourse of my time in government that when everyone was\nagreeing with what I was doing, then it actually made me more\nnervous because I felt like you have these problems, they haven't been solved for a long time, and then if you take the\nsame approach as others, you're gonna fail just like they did. So taking a different approach\ndoesn't mean you're gonna succeed, but at least if you fail, you're gonna fail in an original way. And so I did like this a lot, and I, I think that what I saw was the people who were very\ngood at getting things done that hadn't been done\nbefore were people who came with different qualifications,\ndifferent perspectives, and they came in and\nreally worked the problem in untraditional ways. And so I think in the Middle\nEast I came in with a very different approach than people before me. Not because I came in deliberately trying to do it differently, but because I came in trying\nto listen and understand from people why the problem hadn't been solved. And then think from a first\nprinciple's perspective on what's the right perspective today. Not based on what happened 50 years ago, or not based on what somebody's\nfeelings who were hurt, but what's the right thing to\nmake people's lives better, to make the world a safer, and and more prosperous place tomorrow. - So if we can go back\nto MBS for a little bit, from the person to the vision, there's something called\nVision 2030 about his vision for Saudi Arabia in the future. Can you maybe look from his perspective, what is his vision for the region? - Sure. So, you know, it's funny, we were talking before\nabout how we wish leaders would set big audacious\ngoals and take on big things. Well, that's what he did with Vision 2030, you know, when he was young, and again, this is something that was\nderided, and a lot of people were very skeptical of it, but the people who actually\npicked it up and read it, said, \"This is a very thoughtful plan that's very achievable.\" So he studied his country and said, \"What's our place in the world? What are our advantages? What are our disadvantages?\" And then he set publicly KPIs\nthat he wanted to hold his country to and then put in\nplace plans and committees, and really worked hard to\npush things in that direction, which was pretty remarkable. I think that it's\nsomething, when I saw it, I thought it was very refreshing. I said, \"Wait, in America, why don't we all have,\nyou know, set goals? Why don't we have KPIs?\" And I do think that it's\nsomething that most countries, if not all countries should have, right? One of my favorite quotes was from the \"Alice in Wonderland,\"\nwhere the Cheshire Cat says, \"If you don't know where you're going, it doesn't matter which path you take.\" And so I think that that's\nsomething that really helped set them on a good path and they've been very successful with it. One of the things he told me\nabout putting that together was he said, \"My father's generation, they created this country\nfrom almost nothing. They came here, they were a poor country, they were Bedouins in the desert. And then they look back and\nsee what they've done over 50 years and they say \"It's\nabsolutely remarkable.\" He said, his generation,\nthey come in and they say, \"We're very grateful for everything that's been done to date. but we have so much opportunity that we're not taking advantage of.\" And so, you know, he's now empowered the next\ngeneration to be ambitious, and think big, and grow with it. What that means for his vision\nfor the Middle East is that, you know, the general\narchitecture that should exist. And now there's excitement in\nthe discussions with Israel that have advanced was the\ngeneral view of what we thought from a Trump perspective\nshould be the new Middle East is having an economic\nand security corridor, all the way from Haifa to\nMuscat, from Oman to Israel, where basically, you go\nthrough, and if you can create a security area where people can live free of fear, of\nterrorism, and of conflict. The Middle East for the last\n20 years has been a sinkhole for arms, for death, for terrorism. It's been, you know, awful. It's been a big national\nsecurity threat for America. A big place where our treasure has gone. We've had a lot of our, young, amazing American soldiers killed in action there. And the same thing for the\nArab countries as well. So if we can create a security\narchitecture for that region, and then we can create\neconomic integration between all the different countries. I mean, the amount of\ninnovation happening in Israel is unbelievable. Think of it like Silicon Valley's\nnot connected to the rest of California. You have a very young population, a very digital savvy population. You have a lot of resources. And so if you can get that whole set, the potential for it is unbelievable. I do think that that's his\nultimate vision is to become a really strong country economically, and then to become a place\nwhere you could be funding advancements in science,\nadvancements in humanity, advancements in artificial intelligence, and think about ways to\nbe a positive influence in the world. - So, a difficult question. One big source of tension\nbetween the United States and Saudi is the case of Jamal Khashoggi. I was wondering if you can\ncomment on what MBS has said about it to you. You've spoken to him about it, and what MBS has said about it publicly on \"60 minutes,\" and after. - Yeah, so what he said to me was no different than\nwhat he ultimately said on \"60 Minutes,\" which was, \"As somebody helping lead this country, I bear responsibility. And I'm gonna make sure\nthat those who are involved are brought to justice\nand I'm gonna make sure that we put in place reforms to make sure things like\nthis don't happen again.\" It was a horrible situation that occurred. What I saw from him after that was just a doubling and a tripling\ndown on the positive things he was doing. Figuring out ways to kind\nof continue to modernize his society, build\nopportunity in the kingdom, and to continue to be a better\nally to all the different countries that wanted\nto be aligned with them. - One thing I learned from\nthis case is how one particular situation, a tragedy, can\ndestroy so much progress, and the possibility of progress, and the possibility of\nconnection between the bridges that are built between different nations, and how narratives\naround that can take off, and take such a long time to repair. And you've worked with this\nin the Middle East with Israel and so on, how the\nhistory, the narratives, the stories, they kind\nof have this momentum that's so hard to break, even when you have new leaders, new blood, new ideas that come in. It's just sad to see that\nyes, this tragedy happens, but it doesn't mean that\nyou can't make progress. I dunno if you have kind\nof lessons from that, just how much of a dramatic\nimpact it had on creating tension between the\nUnited States and Saudi, and in general and the Middle East, like, that somehow, Saudi's not a friend, but is against the ideals and the values of the United States. - Yeah. So it did definitely\ncreated massive tension, and it became a very high-profile action that actually overshadowed\na lot of the good work that was being done in the region, and a lot of the progress we were making. But when you think about this\nor you think about the other issues that we've gone through today, I think the general framework\nthat I always try to approach things with is you can't\nchange what happened yesterday, you can only learn from it, and then you can change\nhow you deal with tomorrow. And when I think about, you\nknow, the people in power, what do I hope that they're\nspending their time focused on? Two basic things, number\none, is how do I create safety and security for my\npeople and for the world? And then how do I give people\nthe opportunity to live a better life? And so when things like this\nhappen, obviously, you know, there are certain reactions\nthat are appropriate, but ultimately, you have to\nthink through how do you not allow the paradigm that you're\ncreating in the world to lead to worse outcomes than\nwould happen otherwise? And so, when I would think\nabout foreign policy in general, one of the differences between\nforeign policy and business is that in business, the\nconclusion of a problem set, you finish a deal, you\neither have, you know, a company or a property,\nor if you sell it, you have less to do and, and\nmore capital, hopefully, if it's successful, right? In a political deal, it's\nalways about paradigms. So the end of a problem\nset is always the beginning of a new paradigm. And you're always thinking\nthrough how do you create an environment that leads to\nhopefully the best amount of positive outcomes that could occur versus creating a paradigm that will lead to negative outcomes. So, bad things happen a lot in the world, and you have to make sure\nthat when those happen, people are held accountable for it. But you also don't wanna\nmake sure that in the process of making sure that there's accountability for these actions, you don't set a lot of progress\nthat the world is making back, that will lead\nto worse off situation for many more people."

      "section": "Israeli–Palestinian peace process",
      "text": "- If we can go back to the\nincredible work with Abraham Accords, and Israel, and the Middle East. First, the big question about peace. Why is it so difficult to\nachieve peace in this part of the world between Israel and Palestine, and between Israel and the other countries in the Middle East, or any sort of peace-like agreements? - If I had to give you\nthe most simple answer, I would say that it's structural. And if you go back to the\nincentive structure of different leaders, this whole peace\nprocess between Israel and the Palestinians, and again, I've gotten criticized for saying this, but it's what I believe,\nso I'm gonna say it, is that the incentive\nstructure was all wrong. And when I went before the\nUnited Nations Security Council to discuss the peace plan that I proposed, which again, was more\nof an operational plan, and it was a pragmatic plan, it was over 180 pages in detail. In politics, people don't\nlike putting forward detail because it just\ngives a lot of places for you to get criticized on. Nobody actually criticized\nthe detail of my plan. They just criticized the fact\nthat it was coming from us, and didn't want to debate the merits of the operational pieces of it. So I created a slide where I\nshowed from the Oslo Accords till the day I was there, all the different peace discussions. I put a dove in the slide for those, and then I put a tank for\nevery time there was a war. 'cause there was always\nskirmishes between Hamas, and Hezbollah, and the Palestinians. And then I showed two lines, and they both went from the\nbottom of the page all the way up like this. One of the lines was Israeli settlements. So every time a negotiation failed, Israel was able to get more land, and then the other one was\nmoney to the Palestinians. And I said, \"Every time\na negotiation failed, the Palestinians would get more money.\" The problem with that money though, was that it wasn't going to the people, some of it would make its way down, but most of it was going\nto the politicians. You had leadership of the\nPalestinians who was basically, I think at that point it\nwas in like the 16th year of a four-year term, so it\nwasn't democratically elected. And a lot of what I tried to\nshow was that there was no rule of law, there was no judicial system, there were no property rights, and there was no opportunity\nor hope for the people to live a better life. And so all of the envoys to\ndate were basically trained to go and do the same things. And again, I got massively criticized by all the previous\nenvoys for not doing it the same way they did, but I thought the problem structurally just didn't make sense. And so I felt like the incentive\nstructure was all wrong, and I took a different approach. - And so what's the different approach? - I started writing down a document. These are the 11 issues, but there's really only\nthree issues that matter. I said, \"Just tell me what you think the compromise is that\nyou think the other side could live with, that you would accept.\" And it was very hard to get\nthem talking about this. \"Oh, you have to go back to 1972. You have to go back to 1982. You have to go back to 2001.\" And I was just like, \"I don't need a headache, and I don't need a history lesson. Just, I want a very simple\nthing, here, today, in 2017, what's the outcome that you would accept?\" And I was dealing with their negotiators, their back channel, secret\nnegotiators, their double secret. And I was just like,\n\"This whole thing is like, it's a process created\nwhere nobody wants to talk about the actual solution.\" So coming from the business\nworld, I said, \"Okay, lemme just write down a proposed solution that I think is fair and\nlet me have each side react. Like, don't tell me\nabout theoretical things. Like, tell me I wanna move\nthe line from here to here. I want to change this word. So I tried to make it much more tactical. And what I realized was,\nlike, the Palestinians, they'd worked so hard to\nget the Arab world to stay with the line of the\nArab Peace Initiative. And so I went back and I read\nthe Arab Peace Initiative. It was 10 lines and it\ndidn't have any details. So it was a concept. And so they liked that concept\nbecause it allowed them to reject everything. They kept getting more money. I mean, Bibi Netanyahu, who runs one of the most\nincredible economies in the world, who runs an incredible superpower\nmilitarily for the size of their country, he would\nfly to Washington to meet us, and he'd be taking a commercial LL plane, a boss who runs a refugee\norganization, a refugee group, right, that claims that\nthey don't have a state, that gets billions of dollars\nin aid ever every year from the global community would fly in a $60 million Boeing, BBJ. So the whole thing was\njust very corrupt and off. And I do think that that's why it, I don't think people were\nincentivized to solve it, to be honest. - What do you think an\nactual plan on that part, if you can, just before we\ntalk about Abraham Accords, if there is a peace plan\nthat works between Israel and Palestine, what do\nyou think it looks like? You have to separate it\ninto two different issues. And I think that that's actually\nhow we came to the Abraham Accords is that, you know, I tell the story in the book,\nand it was one of my, like, favorite experiences during\nmy time in diplomacy, where I went to meet with Sultan Qaboos, who was the sultan of Oman. And we fly out there because\nhe'd had a secret meeting with Bibi, and I thought maybe he was open to normalizing with Israel. So after he meets with\nBibi, he calls me and says, \"I want you to come see me.\" So I go over to see him, again, I tell the story,\nit was a crazy night, and all these different areas, but when I was talking to\nhim, he basically says to me, \"I feel badly for the Palestinian people that they carry with them the\nburden of the Muslim world.\" And that line just like stuck with me. And a couple days later I was\nthinking about it and I said, \"Wait a minute. Who elected the Palestinian\npeople to represent the Muslim world on the Al-Aqsa Mosque? And so the reason why I felt\nlike it had never been solved was it was a riddle, A, that I believed was designed to not be solved. But B, you were conflating\ntwo separate issues. You had the issue between Israel\nand, and the Muslim world, which really was the issue\nof the Al-Aqsa Mosque. And then you had just\na territorial dispute, which throughout history, you have lots of territorial disputes, and they're usually\nresolved in different ways. So if you go back to the\nIsraeli-Palestinian issue, there's just a couple\ncomponents you need to solve. Number one is territorial\ncontinuity, right? You need to figure out\nwhere do you draw the lines? And that's something that, you know, you can talk about what\npeople were owed 70 years ago, but it's much more productive to say, \"This is what you can\nmake work today,\" right? And that's kind of what we did. We literally spent months and months drawing a map and we put something out, probably change a couple\nlines here and there, but by and large, it was a very pragmatic solution\nthat I think could work. And I think it could work\nfor the safety and security of Israel, which was number one. So first issue, is drawing a map. Second issue, is security. Again, Israel. And again, this is one\nissue we were incredibly sympathetic with Israel, which is you can't expect, you know, a prime minister of Israel to make a deal where he's gonna make his\npeople less secure than before. So we worked very closely with\nthem on a security apparatus. We laid something out that I\nthink would keep the whole area safer, and it would sure Israel was safe, and also keep the Palestinian issue safe. She needs security. Number three was the religious sites, and that was one that was\nactually always made much more complicated by people, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, because you basically\nhave Haram al-Sharif, which is a place where the\nmosque was built in the seventh or eighth century, but\noriginally it was where the Holy of Holies were\nin the Bet ha-Midrash for the Jewish people. So, and then, compounding by the fact that you have all the Christian\nholy sites in Jerusalem, it's a city that should be\nbringing everyone together, but in fact has become a place\nwhere you have, you know, wars and, and hatred, and a\nlot of different conflicts that have risen because of it. But what I said was, instead\nof fighting over concepts of sovereignty, which is interesting how I got to the notion that this wasn't really the big issue. I basically just operationally, why don't we just make it simple? Let everyone come and be able\nto worship as long as they're being able to worship peacefully. So that's really the contours of it. And what the Palestinians\nhave done is they've kind of deflected from a lot\nof their own shortcomings. And a lot of the Arab\nleaders did that as well, kind of in the pre Abraham\nAccord days by kind of allowing this issue to be so prevalent. So one thing I'll say on the\nPalestinians is that, you know, what we tried to do by laying\nadded plan was we said, \"Okay, what are the reasons why the\nPalestinian people are not having the lives that they deserve?\" And I'll give you a couple things. One is, I studied the\neconomies of Jordan, West Bank, Gaza, Egypt, Morocco. This was numbers from like 2019. But what was interesting\nwas the GDP per capita of somebody living in the West Bank was actually the same as Jordan. And it was actually more than\nsomebody living in Egypt. And the debt of GDP that the\nPalestinians had was like 30, 40% compared to Egypt,\nwhich was at like 130%. In Jordan, which was at 110%, then Lebanon, which is about 200%. And so, you know, you're in a situation\nwhere a lot of this stuff didn't make sense, but if you draw lines, create institutions where\nPalestinian people can now feel like they have property\nrights and have ownership over their place, and let the money flow\npass the leadership ranks to the people, let them have jobs, let them have opportunity, and then let all Muslims from\nthroughout the world have access to the mosque. And Israel making sure that\nthey can control the security, which I think the Jordanians\nand a lot of others want Israel to have strong security control there to prevent the radicalists and\nthe extremists from coming. You could have peace there very easily. - So there's a lot of things to say here. One is just to emphasize Al-Aqsa Mosque. So this holy place, and this is something in our\nconversations and in my own travels, I've seen the\nimportance of sort of frictionless access to those sites from the entirety of the Muslim world. And that's what Abraham\nAccords took big leaps on. Okay, so we'll talk about\nthat a little bit more, but that's kind of a religious component, that's a dignity in\nthe religious practice, and faith component. But then the other thing\nyou mentioned so simply, which is you have money flow\npast the leadership ranks. How do you have money flow\npast the leadership ranks in Palestine? So make sure that the money\nthat's invested in Palestine, the West Bank gets to the people. - So to date, all of the aid that's been\ngiven to the Palestinians has been an entitlement. It's not conditions\nbased, it's always just, we give them money and\nthere's no expectations. It's very simple, you make\nthe aid conditions based, you fight for transparency. You do it through institutions\nother than the PA, or you put reformers into the PA that will allow it to go down that way. - PA being the Palestinian Authority, which is the leadership.\n- It's not hard to do, it just takes people who\nactually wanna do it. But I think the mindset of\nthe international community has not been, \"Let's solve this problem.\" It's like, \"Let's just\nthrow a little bit of money. The money's Novocaine, let's put a little\nNovocaine on the problem, and let's not have to deal with it.\" But nobody's ever said, \"Oh, let's do an accounting of the $20 billion we've given them and see\nhow many jobs it's done, and where it's gone.\" That just hasn't happened. Again. It's an incredibly\ncorrupt organization, UNRWA. You think about the\npost-World War II dynamic, you had a lot of refugees. My grandparents were\nrefugees post-World War II. Every other refugee\nclass has been resettled, and you only have one\npermanent refugee organization ever created. Why was this done? It was done to perpetuate the\nconflict so that a lot of Arab leaders could basically deflect from a lot of their shortcomings at home. And so I think for Israel, they view all these things as existential. They value their safety. They've been under attack for a long time. I do think having a deal where we can say, \"The Jews, and the Muslims,\nChristians, come together. I think King Abdullah from\nJordan's been an incredible custodian for the mosque. I think everyone in my travels\nrecognize that he's the right guy for that, that the king of Jordan\nshould be the custodian of the mosque. We should have some kind of framework to make sure everyone has access. The more countries that have\ndiplomatic relations with Israel, the more Muslims and Arabs that should be able to come and visit. And by the way, the more you\nhave these normalizations, think about what that will\ndo to the economy of the West Bank, where they'll have,\ngreat hotels, hospitality, tremendous tourism industry,\nbecause of all the Christian, Muslim, and Jewish holy\nsites that they have there. So there's a lot of potential there. We just have to get unstuck. I believe that it's so possible\nif the leaders wanna make tomorrow better, that they can. And unfortunately, the people who suffer the most are really, are just the Palestinian people. And I think that, you know, in Gaza, they're hostages to Hamas,\nand in the West Bank, they're just held back, because their leadership just is afraid, or too self-interested to\ngive them the opportunity to change their paradigm, and pursue the potential\nof what they have. And by the way, it's an incredibly\nwell-educated population. It's an incredibly capable population, and they're right next to\nIsrael where the economy, they need everything. And so the potential should be incredible, if you can just move some of these pieces. But again, there's still a lot of emotion, and hatred you have to\nwork through as well. But I do believe that you're\nnot gonna solve that by litigating the past. You're only gonna solve\nthat by creating an exciting paradigm for the future and\ngetting everyone to buy in, and then move towards that. - And maybe increase\nthe chance of being able to establish an economy\nwhere the entrepreneurs can flourish in the West\nBank and so on in Palestine, once the, the relationship across the Arab world is normalized. - So one thing on that,\nwhich is very interesting, is when I got into my job in,\nin, in, in the Middle East, all of the conventional\nthinkers said to me, \"The separation in the\nMuslim world is between the Sunnis and the Shias.\" And that's really the big divide. And as I was traveling, I didn't think there was\nany divide in that regard. The divide that I saw was between\nleaders who wanted to give a better opportunity for their\npeople and create economic reforms and opportunity, and\nleaders who wanted to use religion or fear to keep\ntheir stronghold on power. And so if you think about who's\nnot creating the opportunity for their people, is the Palestinian leadership\nand the Iranian leadership, all the other Arab\ncountries were focused on, \"How do we give opportunity for our people to live a better life?\""

      "section": "Abraham Accords and Arab-Israeli normalization",
      "text": "- And there is big foundation\non which that framework can succeed, which I\nthink is the, in general, the idea of Arab-Israeli normalization. So that's where Abraham Accords come in. Can you tell the story of that? - Sure. So it's an amazing thing, and I sit here today,\nsomebody not in government, and every day I see, another flight that goes between, or I see an Israeli student studying\nat a university in Dubai, or a new synagogue\nopening up in Abu Dhabi. And it just gives me such, or Bahrain, it gives me such tremendous\npride to see all of the progress that's been made. How it occurred, part\nof why I wrote the book was to put this down for history's sake, to go through all the different\nintentional, unintentional, circumstantial things that occurred. It's funny, we left government, there's a lot of people\nsaying, \"Well, this is why.\" I said, \"I was kind of\nat the middle of it,\" and I couldn't even perfectly\narticulate why it happened, because it was in evolution\nof a lot of things. And I joke that we made peace on plan C, but only because we went through\nthe alphabet three times, failing at every letter, and by the time, but we didn't give up, and we kept going, and we got it done. - And maybe this is a good\nplace to also step back and say what is Arab-Israeli normalization? What is the state of things\nfor people who may not be aware before the progress you made? - That's probably the best place to start. So what we did is we\nmade a peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and then Israel and Bahrain. Then we did a deal with Israel and Sudan, then Israel and Kosovo, Israel, Morocco, where basically countries that\ndidn't recognize each other before ended up recognize each other. All of these were Muslim\nmajority countries. And getting them to integrate with Israel was a very big thing. The traditional thinking had always been, was that Muslim Arab countries\nwould not make peace with Israel until the Israeli-Palestinian\nissue was solved. And what we were able to do is\nseparate the issues and then make these connections, which are leading to amazing\ninteraction between Jews and Muslims. So when I think about kind of, obviously, you have national security, you have emotional\nbenefits from these things, but the single biggest benefit that I've seen from the Accords is that if you were an Arab or a Muslim, and you were willing to say\npositive things about Israel or the Jews before this came out, you had been viciously attacked\nby the media or the hordes of influencers or the\nextremists in these different countries. What this did, was it\nbrought out into the public the fact that Jews and\nMuslims can be together, and they can be respectful. They can have meals together, and that the cultures can\nlive together in peace. - So just to linger on this, it's like a once subtle\nand in another sense, like, transformative. So normalization means\nyou're allowed to travel a foreign place together. - That has a kinda ripple effect. Of that, you can now start talking in a little bit more accepting way. You can start integrating,\ntraveling, communicating, doing business with, socializing. So the cultures mix. Conversations mix, all of this, and this kind of has a ripple\neffect on the basic connection between these previously disparate worlds. I don't know if there's a, a\nnice way to kind of make clear why these agreements have\nsuch a transformative effect, especially in the long term. - I would say the simplest\nform is it's just a mindset. And it's almost like\nyou're taught all your life we're enemies, or we can't\nbe friends with that tribe on the other side of the fence. And then like one day the\nleaders get up and say, \"No, it's okay now.\" And there was never an\nissue between the people. The people were just taught\ndifferent things and they were separated from each other. But again, one of the\nthings that I respect about the work you do is\nyou believe in the power of conversation and the\npower of human interaction. And you know, these issues, and gaps between us feel so\nbig when we think about them, when we're told about them,\nwhen we read about them. But when we go and sit with each other, all of a sudden we realize\nmaybe we have a lot more in common than we have that divides us. For me, what I've seen about it that's\nmade the biggest difference, is I've seen people who\nwouldn't have the ability to be together, be together. And that's now forming a\nnucleus of togetherness, which is a restoration. So you think about the modern Middle East from post Holocaust to\nnow, again, in 1948, after that War of Independence, you had Jews living in Baghdad and Cairo, then they became so anti-Jewish, that they then expelled\nall of the Jews from all of these capitals of those cities. So you think about the Jewish\nhistory in Baghdad, I mean, I think the Talmud was written in Baghdad. It was a place where in Babylon, where the Jewish people thrived, I think in five 570 BC, when Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem, he took about 10,000 Jews\nback with him to Babylon, because he thought it'd\nbe good for his economy. And during that place, the Jews actually flourished\nand had a good life there. So for 1,000 years before\nthe Second World War, the Jews and the Muslims lived\nvery peacefully together. So people say that what we're doing now is an aberration. I actually\nthink it's not an aberration. I think it's actually a return\nto the time where people can live together culturally. And so this is the beginning\nof the end of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and it's the\nbeginning of togetherness, which again, you think about how much war, how much provocation, how much terrorism has\nbeen made in the name of religious conflict. This is, I think the start of the process of religious respect and understanding."

      "section": "$2 billion Saudi investment",
      "text": "- We've talked about you\nbeing attacked in the press for the Russian collusion\nand other topics. One of the most recent set\nof attacks comes on the topic of Saudi public investment fund, giving $2 billion to your\ninvestment firm after you left government. So that includes a 1.25%\nasset management fee of $25 million a year. Can you respond to these\nrecent set of attacks? - Sure. So, left government. Obviously, worked for four years. It was a very action-packed time, that's why I wrote the book. I wanted to put down\nall those experiences. I started thinking like,\n\"What do I wanna do next?\" Right? So my previous career,\nI'd been in real estate. I worked with my brother on\nsome technology businesses that I'd started, and then\nI got into government. So I kind of had a career shift, right? In my previous career, obviously, was very successful. The New York Times, they violated, and they published\nmy financial statements. They showed I was making\nabout $50 million a year in the private sector\nbefore I went to government. I went into government, I volunteered. I didn't take a salary. I paid for my own health\ninsurance for four years, my wife and I. And then we went, and I was thinking, \"Should I go back to my old company, or should I start something new?\" And my thinking was, is that I'd, through my time in government,\nI'd met so many people, I'd learned so much about the world. I had a big understanding\nnow for how the macroeconomic picture worked. And I did feel like there was\na lot more that I could do than just going back to real estate. In the meantime, I was getting a lot of\ncalls from different CEOs, and companies saying, \"Can you help me with this company? Can you help me with that company? Your knowledge could be\nhelpful to help this company navigate this challenge or\nto expand internationally.\" And so I said, \"You know what? Maybe I should create a business\nto do an investment firm where I can do something\ndifferent, where I'm putting together geopolitical expertise,\nand traditional private equity, and growth investing, and figure out how to do that, where I can do something differentiated, where I can invest in growing things, and help with my navigation\nskills and relationships.\" So that was kind of the thesis\nof what I thought could make sense as kind of a next step. I called, you know, different friends. They were very excited\nto, to back the effort. Obviously, this was coming off the success that I just had in the\nMiddle East where I did six peace deals there. And, you know, one of the notions I wanted\nto be able to do with the firm was to be able to take money\nfrom the Gulf and then to be able to invest it in Israel, to continue to build the economic links between the countries. Again, if countries\nhave more economic ties, I think war and fighting is less likely. And then in addition to that, I wanted to figure out how do\nyou bring the entrepreneurs together from both of those countries. So that was really the mission\nof what I set out to do. So far, I've been enjoying it. It's been a lot of fun,\nI've been learning a ton. I think we're doing very well with it. In terms of the criticisms, I think that I've been\ncriticized in every step of everything I've always done in my life. And so what I would say is, you know, this business is actually an\nobjective metric business. Right? It's about returns. So, you know, in three,\nfour years from now, five years from now, see how I do, hopefully, I'll do very well,\nand judge me based on that. In terms of any of the\nnefarious things, you know, I haven't been accused of\nany of violating any laws. And, you know, I haven't violated any of\nthe ethics rules either. When I was in government,\nevery year submitted all my financial to the\nOffice of Government Ethics. They certified it every year. And I followed every rule\nand every law possible. So, to my critics, I'll say, \"Criticize me before,\nyou'll criticize me now.\" I'm gonna keep doing me\nand I'm gonna keep pursuing things that I think are worthwhile. And I'm very excited about\nthis chapter of my career."

      "section": "Donald Trump",
      "text": "Maybe this is a good place to\nask in working closely with Donald Trump, what, in your\nsense, looking into the mind of the man, what's the biggest strength of Donald Trump as a leader? - I would say his unpredictability. I think that as a leader, he\nconsumes a ton of information. He doesn't like to be managed\nor have his information filtered. So he'll speak to a lot of people to draw his information himself. He's very pragmatic. I don't see him as terribly ideological. I see him as somebody who's about results. I think he wants to deliver results. And I think ultimately, I mean, he's an incredible fighter. He's a big counter puncher, but he also wants to\nget along with people. And that's probably the biggest\nsurprise that people found with him. I mean, you look at even situations, like, I would always tell people,\n\"If you disagree with him, don't go on television and criticize him. Just pick up the phone and\ncall him, and go see him, and he'll talk to you about it.\" He may not agree with you, but again, that's what Kim Kardashian\ndid when she had a case of clemency with a woman, Alice Johnson, that she felt strongly about,\nwe went through the case. I wouldn't have had her call\nif I didn't think it was a legitimate case. So we spent about eight\nmonths quietly working through the case, working through the details to make sure that it really was a worthy case. I brought it to President Trump said, \"She'd like to come meet with you to talk about this case.\" And he said, \"Have her come in.\" So she came in, we went through the case, and President Trump ultimately\ngranted the clemency to Alice Johnson, who was a woman who was\naccused of being part of a drug ring. She had, basically, a life\nsentence for doing it. She'd served 22 years in prison. While in prison, I mean, she\nbasically was a grandmother. And she putting on the prison plays. She was mentoring young women in prison. Somebody who, again,\nthere's always a risk, but by and large had a\nvery, very, very low risk of committing a crime in the future. And then it goes back to the notion of, are we gonna judge people\nby the worst decision they make in their life? And so President Trump was\nwilling to grant the clemency. And it went. And I think that it just\ngoes to the notion of like, maybe this goes back to his\nunpredictability in a positive way, which is, if you go sit with him, and you make your case, he'll hear you, he'll listen to you. And he is not afraid to act. And he's not afraid to be controversial, which I think is a good thing. So from a foreign policy\npoint of view, in particular, his unpredictability just meant\nthat everyone was always on their back foot. People were afraid to\nkind of cross America. And what I would tell\npeople who don't like Trump, as I would say, \"Think about\nhow crazy he's making you, and his enemies. He did that to the enemies of America.\" So he was a very, very strong president, and I think did a, a great job. - So in some of these agreements I've been talking about\nand speaking with leaders, how do you think the\nunpredictability helps? - So in all the agreements\nthat I was negotiating, I wasn't doing it as a principle. I was doing it on behalf\nof President Trump, and people knew that I had\naccess to President Trump, and they knew that, you know, I could say, you may say this that we don't like, but I'm gonna have to take it back to him, and then we'll see what he does. And one of the biggest\ninstances was on the USMCA trade deal, where that deal\nhappened because Mexico was legitimately concerned, and smartly so, that\nPresident Trump was going to impose tariffs on the car industry, which would've been\ndecimating to their economy. And by the way, he was ready to do it. We were holding him back from\ndoing it with every ounce of strength that we could,\nso it wasn't a bluff. I mean, that was actually real. But they were smart to\nread that it was real. And ultimately we created\na great win-win deal. Tell you a funny story\njust popped into my mind from the tariffs, is we did also, we used a 232 national security\nexemption to protect our steel industry, and we put tariffs\non steel and aluminum. And again, I thought about this, 'cause we also negotiated\nthem with Canada, and there was a very funny\nphone call where Trudeau is calling Trump. And again, they got along,\nyou know, decently well. And Trudeau's calling and saying, \"You can't put national security\ntariffs on us in Canada. We're, we're your NATO ally. We fought wars with you,\nwe do military together.\" And Trump says to him, \"Didn't you burn the\nWhite House down in 1812?\" And Trudeau says, \"That was the French.\" He says, \"No, it was the Canadians.\" And so it was just, you know, like I said, he's always keeping\neveryone on their toes. He took very calculated risks. And like I said, you know, everyone was outraged all\nthe time with everything. But if you look at his body of work, people said if he was elected,\nhe would start World War III. Meanwhile, we inherited\na world filled with wars, no new wars, right? Three years, he made\npeace deals, no new wars. He was tough, he was strong. People respected him, he built relationships,\nand got trade deals done, got peace deals done,\nthe economy was rocking. His body of work, I think, was\npretty strong as president."

      "section": "War in Ukraine",
      "text": "- Like you said, no new wars. This makes me think if Donald\nTrump won the presidency, what the current situation\nin Ukraine would look like. But let me just ask you zoom\nout and ask you broadly. Do you think the war in Ukraine\ncould have been avoided? And what do you think it\ntakes to bring it to an end? - I think a 100% it would've\nbeen avoided, not 99%, You know, President Trump for four years had no problems with Russia. You know, we were arming Ukraine, but we were working with Russia. And again, the first two years we had a\nlittle bit of issue working with Russia because they were\naccused of colluding with us. And so we had to go\nthrough that investigation. But in the second two years, we were trying to focus\nRussia on what are the areas where we can collaborate together. I think Russia, you know, we thought it was in their\nstrategic advantage to play US and China against each other, because of the way that\neverything was done before. They were stuck with China, but not getting a lot for it. Under Bush, they took Georgia, Under Obama, they took Crimea. Under Trump, there was no problems. And then under Biden, unfortunately, I think they misplayed a couple of things, which I think provoked\nRussia to go forward. Still no excuse to do what they did. I think that the invasion\nwas a terrible thing, and should not have occurred. But with that being said, I think 100%, if Trump was president, there would not be a war in Ukraine today. - Coming to the table\nand negotiating a piece, whether it's Donald\nTrump, whether it's Biden, whether it's anybody, what\ndo you think it takes? Do you think it's possible? And if you're in a room, if\nJared Kushner is in the room, with Vladimir Putin\nand Volodymyr Zelensky, what does it take to have\na productive conversation, and what does it take for\nthat conversation to fail? Like what are the trajectories\nthat lead to success and failure? - I think we go back to negotiations. Number one, is trust, right? Both leaders have to have the\nability to communicate what an off-ramp is without fearing it's gonna leak to the public. So if you go to the posture\nof Zelensky right now. And by the way, President Zelensky I have a lot of respect\nfor the courage he showed, especially initially. You saw what Ghani did in Afghanistan. They were getting attacked by the Taliban. He took the cash and got\nthe hell outta there. Staying in, in Kiev when he did, how he did it, was one\nof the most brave things we've seen in a long time. And he has a ton of my\nrespect and admiration for doing that. But now, he's promising his\npeople we're gonna win the war and the military action has\nnot necessarily coincided with that sentiment. And so there has to be\nsome form of off-ramp, but he can't say that publicly. So for him to be able to\nwork privately with somebody who can help create a new paradigm where both leaders can say,\n\"We're gonna stop the bloodshed. We're gonna stop the risk of\nnuclear war for the world, we're gonna stop what's happening.\" That's really what it will\ntake. How that occurs, again, it's not something I'm involved in now. So I don't know who the right\nbroker is or how to put that together, but essentially,\nthey need somebody in between them who can figure out, how do you create a landing\nzone that that works? 'cause neither party's\ngonna jump until the pool is filled with water. And it, you have to outline\nwhat the go forward looks like, because you can't just stop\nit for them to get worse for both parties. You have to move it forward\ninto what happens next, that hopefully, can start to turn the tide to benefit both sides, where they can focus on the\nfuture instead of being stuck into the old paradigm of who started what, who's to blame for what,\nwho did what to who. It's just a lot of tough stuff\nnow that that's occurred, that's gonna be hard to walk back. And it's a big task to get it done, but for the sake of the world, it'd be amazing if we were\nable to reach a conclusion to that conflict. - Just going back to your\nearlier mention of North Korea, what do you think it takes\nto bring Vladimir Putin, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy\nto the table together? - Leadership. - So you're saying like it\nhas to be a US president. - It has to be somebody\nwho's willing to put themself on the line to go and do it, And, again, if you're the US president\nand you're the most powerful nation in the world, you should be trying. But I do think, again, the posture that the US\nhas taken has probably been in a place where they, it would be very hard for 'em\nto get the trust of Russia, based on the way that they've\nplayed their moves to date. And I always thought from the\nbeginning that Putin would try to bring in President Xi\nin China to resolve it, to basically give a big\nscrew you to America to say, \"China's now the one in charge of this.\" But that hasn't seemed to\nmanifest itself to date either. But it takes leadership, you know, the leaders have to get it and say, \"Let's get everyone together, and let's try to get this done.\" Because every day it goes\non, A, more people are dying, and, B, you know, we do risk\nnuclear war for the world, which is not a good situation."

      "text": "- Let me ask, since you\nhelped set up phone calls between Donald Trump, Putin,\nand King of Saudi Arabia. If I were to interview Putin,\nwhat advice would you give on how to get a deep\nunderstanding of the human being? - Yeah, so I didn't\ndeal with Russia a ton, but in my interaction with,\nwith Putin and with Russia, you know, I would kind of\npoint out a couple of things. Number one, is when America was\nhit with COVID, and New York was looking like we were\ngonna run out of ventilators and masks, Russia was the second country that sent us a plane load of supplies. And they didn't send that\nbecause they hate America. They sent that because we\nwere starting to make progress together as countries. And they thought that they\nwanted to show goodwill to figure out how can we start working together. And again, people may attack me for saying that that sounds naive. Again, the past, you know, 15 years may show that\nthat's not the case, but I don't believe that\ncountries have permanent enemies, and I don't believe countries\nhave permanent allies, right? Again, you think about the US\nand Russia and World War II, we worked together to\ndefeat the Nazis, right? And now we're great allies with Germany, who basically was our great\nenemy in World War II. We're great allies with Japan, who's our great enemy in World War II. So it goes back to the notion\nwe discussed earlier of you shouldn't condemn tomorrow\nto be like yesterday, if you're unhappy with yesterday. So, so number one, is, I\nwould definitely ask him about that. The phone call that you mentioned\nwas after we did a pretty intense negotiation to\ncreate the largest oil cut in the history of oil production. So during COVID, demand\njust shut off like crazy, and it was stopping very quickly. Saudi and Russia at that\ntime were having conflict. They created this thing called OPEC+, which goes back, again, history between the two countries\nwhere they had conflicts, and then, all of a sudden, they\nwere working together to try to stabilize the oil markets, but they couldn't agree on the cuts. So Saudi actually increased production. So you had two things hitting\nat once where Saudi and Russia were both increasing production\nand demand was dropping. So you were headed for a real crisis. And I was starting to get\ncalls from a lot of the oil industry executives\nhere in America saying, \"You don't understand, we can't just like flip a switch, and turn off our oil wells. We're running out of storage here.\" And I said, \"Look, President\nTrump likes low oil prices, so he's not upset about what's happening. You have to call him, and if he gives me\npermission or the instruction then I can try to intervene. But right now, he's not\ninclined to intervene. After a little bit, he\nsaid, \"You know what? It's time, get involved, go do it.\" It was right over Passover,\nthis was during COVID. I spent three days nonstop on\nthe phone with Caril Demetria from Russia and with, with MBS directly. And I was dealing with Dan Brouillette who was our energy minister,\ngoing back-and-forth. And it was, like, it was crazy. I mean, it was just one of\nthe craziest negotiations. We ended up agreeing on the\nlargest oil cut in the history of the world. But the story you went to before, which was pretty funny,\nwas finally make the deal. And we set up a call between\nKing Salman, Vladimir Putin, and President Trump to announce the deal. And I'm like, \"Oh, this is great this.\" so President Trump gets\non, says, \"Congratulations. We have a deal. And then King Salman says,\n\"We don't have a deal. Mexico hasn't agreed to their cuts.\" He's said, \"What do you mean?\" And so they were part of the OPEC+. And so I get a note saying,\n\"You gotta go call Mexico.\" So I'm calling Mexico, they're saying \"We're not doing any cuts.\" I said, \"Why? I said, \"We're hedged at $55.\" I said, \"Why didn't you tell\nus that at the beginning?\" So I'm telling the Saudis. So we were working\nthrough this whole thing. So meanwhile, we were trying to find the compromise with Mexico. I set up a call with Trump and Putin, so they can kind of talk this through. And he was always trying to\nplay the game of how do we get Russia, A, away from China? He always thought that that\nwas not the right strategic framework for US interests. And again, we had no problems\nwith them during that time. What I would say is that\nfor Zelenskyy and Putin, any conversation with both of\nthem is about understanding their perspective. I think with Putin, he's\na student of history from the things that I saw with him. If you look at Russia\nover the last 500 years, I think they were attacked\nby the Polish in early 1600. I think they were attacked\nby the Swedes in the 1700s. I think they were attacked\nby Napoleon in the 1800s. And then in the 1900s, they\nwere attacked by Germany twice, and so from his\nperspective, there is, you know, in the early days of Russia, they were attacked by the Mongols. They were very vulnerable. And a lot of the geography\nof Russia today is really designed for defensive purposes, that they have natural\nbarriers that makes them easier to defend. And Russia's a massive landmass, it's twice the size of America. They have 11 times zones in the country. And so I do think that for Vladimir Putin, his biggest concern is, \"How do we create a security paradigm in the west of his country\nthat won't be a creep. And I think that there's like\ntwo different parts of the mindset, you know the\npeople who are most cynical of Putin will say, \"Well, he's just trying to recreate the USSR. He's being expansionist.\" And the people who wanna be\nsympathetic to him will say, \"Well, if you think about it, the Russian perception\nof the NATO arrangement, was that they wouldn't\nbe expanding westward.\" Over the last years, they've included all these countries that they said they promised\nthey wouldn't include, who knows what the\npromises were, or weren't. But what I do know from his\nperspective is allowing Ukraine into NATO was always a red line. And that's why we never offered it. We never provoked it, we never brought it up. We said \"We're gonna arm 'em.\" And we basically said, \"Just calm down. We don't want any conflicts there. We have bigger issues\nand bigger opportunities to work from.\" So I do think you have to\nthink through what's a paradigm that he can accept. And I do think that, you know, he'll give the justification\nfor why he's done what he's done. And then I think the framework\nfor a solution is about how do we move both parties forward? Tough job. I hope you get the opportunity to do it, because I think it's a conversation that will only help the world, hopefully, find a pathway forward. - And I should mention, 'cause\nyou mentioned geography, one of the many books\nyou've recommended to me that gives a very interesting\nperspective on history, it's called \"Prisoners of\nGeography\" by Tim Marshall. And it has a very interesting perspective on the geopolitical conflicts\nand perspective of Russia from a geography perspective, and also for China in the second chapter. And there's a lot of\nunderstanding of why the expansion of NATO is such a concern for Russia, because geography still,\neven in the 21st century, less and less so because\nof technology and so on, but it still plays a major\nrole in conflicts between nations, rivers, and mountains. - And understanding the DNA of countries. It was one of the most phenomenal books. I just found it on Amazon randomly, but I loved every minute of it. The chapter on America is also incredible. Going through the evolution of, you know, how we became the country we are, the different acquisitions,\nthe different changes, why we have all these\ngeographic advantages. And it's an unbelievable book for anyone who's interested in geopolitics."

      "text": "- So I have to ask on\nseveral aspects of China, first on the president. The meeting, you helped\nset up a first call, and first meeting between\nDonald Trump and Xi Jinping, can you tell the story of that? Because that's also interesting, again, that first phone call, the reaching out, the forming the human connection, which ultimately leads to the\nconnection between nations, and the possibility of collaboration. - So during the transition, President Trump took a call\nfrom the head of Taiwan, and that sent the Chinese\ninto a real tailspin. And he didn't do it I think\nto be provocative to them, as much as just as a businessman. He felt, you answer your call, somebody wants to speak\nto you, you speak to him. Like, you wanna have conversations, hear their point of view. But it was taken as a very\nbig insult and it was against tradition and norm. And so that was something that set us off in a wrong direction. My view at the time was that, you know, we are kind of entering a G2 world, whether people wanna admit it or not. And that a lot of these countries, in what I call the\nmiddle market countries, were basically playing, this is when China was\nbeing aggressive with their One Belt One Road. They were basically playing us\nand China against each other. And I thought that by the\ntwo leaders coming together, there were some things\nthey wouldn't agree on, but there was a lot that\nthey probably could agree on, which could lead to resolutions to a lot\nof issues in the world. That was like my most optimistic view. My most, more pragmatic view, was that President Trump\nhad very big issues on trade that he wanted to get to with China. He felt like China, their\ntrade practices were unfair. They weren't following all\nthe global rules of trade. He was a little bit nervous\nthat they would be provocative with Taiwan. And I felt like the two\nof them getting together would be the best way\nto try and resolve that. So the Chinese are very proud,\nand a lot of it's about face. And so we, in order to\nnegotiate for that first call, we basically agreed on what\nwould happen in the call. So not, let's just have a call,\nsay, \"Hi, nice to meet you.\" It was a question of President Trump basically agreed that he would acknowledge the One China policy, which he didn't see as a big concession, because you could\nun-acknowledge it the next day. So, \"Yeah, I'll acknowledge it, and then we'll go and exchange.\" President Xi was gonna come\nover to the US for a visit, so they could sit together, and they wanted to do it\noutside the White House. And so we agreed on Mar-a-Lago, which I also thought was good, 'cause President Trump always\nfelt much more comfortable when he was hosting at his properties. And he just felt at home. And so he liked having people\nas his guests, he loved it. He always felt really\nrelaxed and it was great. So that was really what we did. Then the Chinese come over,\nvery much anticipated visit, and it was incredible. So they were supposed to\nsit together for 15 minutes, and they sat about an\nhour and a half together. And during that meeting,\nPresident Trump, said, \"Look, let's just set some ground\nrules to this relationship. Let's just not talk about Taiwan. Just don't do anything I\ndon't want it on the table. If it does, I'm gonna\nhave to do harsh things. I just don't want this to\nbe a problem for four years, we got bigger issues.\" They basically just, again, you notice four years\nof Trump administration, no Taiwan talk whatsoever,\nit was a non-issue. Started talking about the trade issues. They spent a lot of time on North Korea. President Trump was trying\nto get the perspective from President Xi about North\nKorea because that was, again, considered from Obama, the biggest national\nsecurity issue that we faced at the time. And, and they just had a\ngood feeling for each other. It also helped that,\nyou know, my wife and I, we actually had a Chinese\nnanny and teacher in our house, and our kids learned fluent Mandarin. And our daughter actually\nopened when President Xi and President Trump were together with Melania and with Madame Peng, is my daughter actually sang\nthem a couple of Chinese songs. And I thought that was a\nnice way to show, you know, we're tough, but we respect your culture. So Chinese have an incredible\nculture that goes back thousands of years. They're very proud in\nhow and how they do it. And I think that sign of\nrespect also set things off in a very warm way for\nPresident Trump to say, \"My granddaughter speaks Chinese, and we're showing you the respect,\" which I think is very important. And he did have respect for them. The next part about the visit, I mean, obviously, we had a\nlot of discussions on trade, but the part that was probably\nmost impactful to me was President Xi basically did\nan hour monologue at lunch where he just went through Chinese history from his perspective. And he talked about, with\nparticularly emphasis on kind of the treaty of unequals, and then 100 years of humiliation. And then you go through from\nMao all the way to today, and you had China coming back, and rising. And you could tell that he was, learned the lessons from the\npast, and was very committed to kind of seeing China go through. So that was a different time, right? So China today is different\nthan it was in 2017. In 2017, I remember\nPresident Xi was at Davos and he was vetted by all\nthe top business people in the world as the, you know, Donald Trump was the threat\nto the global world order. President Xi was the\nchampion of free trade, and the biggest champion\nof environmentalism, and fighting for climate change. And what occurred was President\nTrump came in and basically said like, \"I think China's not been\nfollowing the rules-based order.\" Took very, very drastic\napproaches with tariffs. Every time he would do the\ntariffs again, you know, I had Mnuchin, our treasury\nsector come to Vanka's house. If he does this, this is\ngonna crash the whole economy. I mean, and by the way, he believed it. I mean, these were things\nthat people were telling him would be very tough to do. You know, President Trump had a gentleman named Ambassador Lighthizer, Robert Lighthizer, he was\nreally the, tip of the spear on all of our, our trade negotiations. He worked very well as Secretary Mnuchin. We ended up increasing tariffs\nto numbers that hadn't even been thought could happen. So we did the first round of tariffs. Then, you know, the Chinese came back and\nretaliated very surgically trying to hit us in all the areas\nthat politically would've been difficult, and what Trump did\nwas, instead of backing down, he took some of the\nrevenue from the tariffs, gave it to the farmers and said, \"I know that this is\ngonna hurt your business, but I'm gonna make sure\nyou guys are made whole.\" And then he doubled down\nand basically went back at the Chinese with even more tariffs. So what we watched over a\nyear and a half was probably the biggest hand of poker\nthat was ever played. And it was an amazing\nexperience to be a part of it. And the role I played was\nreally working for Secretary Mnuchin and Ambassador Lighthizer as a back channel with the\nChinese to make sure we can just deescalate things and get to solutions in the best way possible. And so, anyways, it\nwas a fascinating time, but if you think about\nthe global awareness of the bad practices that China\nwas putting in place today versus what they were in 2016, I think one of President\nTrump's most successful policies was shifting the way the entire\nworld understood the threat of China and then putting in\nplace the beginning of a regime to try and rebalance the world\nso that we could have more economic parity. - So you mentioned to me the book, \"The Hundred-Year Marathon\"\nby Michael Pillsbury when we discussed China. And I've gotten a chance\nto read parts of it, and I'd highly recommend people read it, 'cause it's a definitely\nan eyeopening perspective. I don't know if I agree with all of it. I dunno if you agree with all of it, but it's certainly opens, it gives a very intense\nperspective on China. And you said it was\ninstructive to how you thought, how Donald Trump thought about China. Can you describe the\nmain thesis of the book, and maybe with the hopeful view how it's possible to have\na trajectory of these two superpowers working\ntogether in the 21st century versus fighting against each other? - Perfect, so it's a very, very big book, and I think it's a book\ndefinitely worth reading. Michael is tremendous. He speaks fluent Mandarin. So he spent a lot of time\nresearching to do the book. So I highly recommend it to everyone. And it was considered more of\na fringe perspective in 2016. But it really, I think came to represent\nthe underpinning of what the collective thought was\nof the Trump administration. And maybe you could argue\nthat it was even more cynical. The whole thesis of the book\nwas that China from 1949 to 2049 was working to reclaim\ntheir position as the global leader, right? So you had the Chinese empire. You know, one of the things, I dunno if it's from this\nbook or a different book that I read that spoke\nabout how in the late 1700s, basically the emperor of\nChina was offered some of the industrial capability from England, which was basically now becoming\nthe industrial revolution. And they said, \"No, we're fine. We're the great Chinese empire. We don't need any of these things. We're better than that.\" And by rejecting that, the\nrest of the world got stronger. China remained weaker. Then you had the opium wars. The Chinese had big opium\nproblems through all the trade back-and-forth. And then China from about\n1840 to to to 1940, 100 years, where they really, after\nall these treaties, were really second class a country. And so then you have the people's\nrevolution that comes in. And he talks about how China\nvery strategically is a very, very poor country, you know,\nwould fight their way back, and build brick by brick. And you know, he proffers\nin the book that Nixon didn't go to China and open China. It was China that actually went to Nixon, and was able to use Nixon\nin order to open up. And then they talk about how under Carter, they were able to get the US to contribute to a lot of their, they were able to kind of\nstart borrowing the US knowhow from our university\nsystems, from our medical, from our science, from our research. And the whole notion that\nwas the conventional thinking of American leaders was that the more we helped China advance,\nthe more they would become a free market economy. And it was a great market. The only difference was,\nwas that they weren't allowing us access. They were making our\ncompanies basically give them all of their technical knowledge. They were stealing our\nintellectual property, they were doing espionage to\nsteal a lot of the patents. They were just ignoring our patents, and they weren't\nfollowing any of the rules of international trade. Then they started becoming\nthe world's manufacturing hub. They basically came the\nworld's factory and then they started this whole initiative called the Belt and Road Initiative in order to start locking\nin their lines of trades. They were buying up all\nthe ports everywhere. They were building railways,\nthinking, \"How do we lock in our, distribution\nso that we can maintain the dominance as the\nworld's global factory?\" And so it was a brilliant long-term plan that they were doing. And by raising awareness,\nby putting the tariffs, Trump slowed them down a lot. The real question is, is if they actually did\nachieve this full objective of becoming the world dominant country, what they would've done with it, whether they would've\nbeen nefarious or not. I think from my perspective, even with some of the divisions\nand issues we have now in America, I still would rather an\nAmerican-led world order, than a Chinese-led world order. But the notion was, is that they were playing a\nvery zero sum game and really going to be the dominant\nleader in this new world order. So that really framed the perspective. And it wasn't necessarily, you know, and the Chinese were always fearing, \"Is Trump trying to stop our rise, right?\" And you have a great book\nalso by Graham Allison that he writes about. You know, are we destined\nfor war between us and China? And he goes through different\nhistorical times where you have a power and a rising superpower. And I think, you know, more than half the time\nit ends up leading to war. So the question is, is\nwhat's gonna happen here? And I do think that Trump's perspective, and this is my interpretation, because everything was\nalways tactical day-to-day. And you know, he was\nunpredictable to the Chinese, which they couldn't deal with. And he was unpredictable\neven to his team sometimes, because he was playing it day-by-day, and issue by issue and always\nchanging and adjusting, which is how an entrepreneur thinks. He respected the job they did\nby building their country. They moved 300 million\npeople out of poverty into the middle class. They did it at the expense\nof a lot of other countries throughout the world, especially America. But Trump says, \"Look, stupid\npoliticians made deals. I respect China for doing what they did. But what I wanna do is I\nwanna change the paradigm, so that for the next 20 years, we can maintain our advantage over them, we can maintain our competitive dynamic.\" And you know, his general view was that America\nis the best private sector in the world. We have a lot of the\nbest minds in the world, and if we could just have a\nlevel playing field with set rules, then America should\nbe able to outperform. And so that's really what\nwe were trying to do. We were trying to kind of get\nrid of some of their state subsidies, make them follow\nsome of these international rules of trade, and not allowing them to do\npredatory investments that then undercut different industries\nthat we had so that they can have global market dominance\nor monopolies on different industries and then have pricing power. But also, you know, geopolitical power. So like one of the examples\nthat people talk about now is China for the last 20 years was very advanced on seeing\nthis electrification trend. They went, they subsidized solar panels. A lot of the American solar panel players were put outta business. So now I think it's like 90\nplus percent of solar panels in the world are manufactured in China. Then all the rare earths that\nyou need in order to make these solar panels and to\nmake these electric vehicles. China's bought up most of\nthem and a lot of the refining capacities in China. So thinking through strategically\nhow do we create an even playing field so that we're\nnot at the mercy of them, and how you can have a a\nrules-based world order, that was really kind of the\nthought of what we were trying to work towards. - So there's this SNL skit\nwhere Jimmy Fallon plays you, and you're walking into the\nOval office, looking cool, wearing shades, and a\nbulletproof vest to the song \"Unbelievable\" by EMF. I dunno if you've seen\nit, but it's pretty epic. And then Trump says that\nyou've traveled the world representing the administration, but no one has ever heard you speak. So there's a lot of questions\nI can ask about that clip. But one of them is, can you introspect why you\nchoose this low key approach of kind of operating behind the scenes, and not speaking much to the\npublic, at least at the time. You've spoken a little bit more. And today, you've spoken\nfor a really long time, which I deeply appreciate. - No, it's been a pleasure to do this, and thank you for the opportunity to talk about these things. And so that was a really funny skit. And you know, it's funny, the thing I got made fun\nof the most for that was the wardrobe, and that came from after three months in the administration we were having dinner with all\nthe generals and they were saying, you know, updating\nus on the war with ISIS. And General Dunford\nsaid to me after, \"Look, the president can't come to see\nhow we're fighting this war, but I'd like to invite you to\ncome with me to Iraq and come see, and would you come with me?\" I said, \"You know what, that's great.\" I always learned in business\nthat you can't make decisions from just an ivory tower, you have to go to the front lines and see what's actually happening. So I said, \"No problem, I'd love to go.\" Meanwhile, two days\nbefore I'm about to go, the doc from the White House stops by my office and says, \"We need to get your blood type,\" I said, \"Why do you mean my blood type?\" He says \"You're going\nto an active war zone. I'm like, \"Okay, I guess\nI'll go to a war zone.\" I didn't really think\nthis thing fully through. So I get on the plane\nwith Dunford and we land in Iraq, and he looks like GI Joe. He's a great general. He is very, very well\nrespected in the military. And we go in, and we get\non Black Hawk helicopter, they said, you know, \"Today's a nice day. Let's take the, the sides off.\" And so I get on the plane\nand there's a guy, you know, military service officer who\nthen takes a machine gun, locks it into a thing, takes the bullets, puts them into the gun, and\nis sitting there saying, \"We're ready to go.\" And then I'm looking out\nand there's like three other helicopters with guys. One was an osprey with a guy buckled in, also with a machine gun looking out. We take off, and we're flying\nover Baghdad from the airport to the embassy. And as we're going, I'm sitting in an open air\nhelicopter with the chairman of the joint, chiefs of staff, guys with machine guns everywhere. - This is a new experience for you, you haven't experience previously? - I would say slightly. I mean, I was doing real\nestate like three months ago, you know, and now I'm flying over Iraq, and the chairman says, \"That's\nSaddam Hussein's palace.\" And I look down, there's like a big bomb\nright through the middle. Then you see the area with\nthe two swords in the hands. I'm saying to myself, like,\n\"How the hell did I get here?\" Like, what is happening? So meanwhile, we end up\ngoing to the front lines to be with the service,\nthe Iraqi military, which the US military\nis working closely with. And I had a meeting that night\nwith the president of Iraq. And so I wore, what do you wear to the\nfront lines in a battle zone, and also meet the president? So I put a sports jacket on, we land at the the front line, and they give me a bulletproof vest that says Kushner on it. I tape it, I put it on, I go out and I cover the\nN-E-R, so it just said, Kush. - Kush, yeah.\n- And, I went, and I didn't realize they\nwere taking pictures. - I think the picture looks pretty epic, you with sunglasses, I love it. - So anyway, so that was\nthe funny story behind that. And then actually my brother\nwas at a some society event in New York and he ran into Jimmy Fallon. So the two of 'em took a selfie\ntogether and Josh writes me, he says, \"Hanging out with my\nolder brother in New York.\" You know, I'm trying to explain to him what your voice sounds\nlike, so it was good. So that was a funny one. But I think just being behind\nthe scenes for me just gave me more maneuverability in the\nsense that, you know, again, it goes back to trust and people\nknowing that I wasn't gonna try to publicize the things\nthey were telling me. I think it just gave me more\nability to operate that way. And I also realized too, like, communicating is\na very important skill. Luckily in Washington, there's no shortage of\namazing communicators. I think there were a lot of\npeople who were much better at me than being communicators. So I was very happy that\nthey were willing to do it, 'cause it wasn't something\nthat I had a lot of experience with or necessarily I\nthought I was very good at. And so I kind of just did my job, and and just focused\non getting things done."

      "text": "- So let me, let me ask, you have a very interesting life. If you were to give\nadvice to young folks on how to have such an impactful\nlife, what would you say? Career and life, how to have a successful\ncareer and a successful life? - Number one is, I would say you just have to\nwork hard at everything you do. Number two, I would say\nnever stop learning, and always try to say\nyes more than you should. Go outta your comfort zone. And I think just, you gotta\nwork hard at everything you do. And, if you're gonna take something on, do it the best you can. You know, one of the lessons\nI write about in the book from my father was, I remember I was going for a\njob interview and he asked me, he says, \"Well, what time are you leaving to\nthe job interview is at nine o'clock?\" I said, \"I'll leave at eight o'clock.\" He says, \"Well, what if there's traffic?\" I said, \"Dad, I've done\nthis drive 1,000 times.\" Like there's never traffic. He said, \"What if there's an accident?\" I said, \"I can't control that.\" He said, \"Jared, the only excuse you ever\nhave for being late. He said \"You didn't leave early enough. And I just think it's\nsomething where if you wanna accomplish something, you know, a lot of people I hear they\ncomplain about what other people do or why it's hard or\nwhy it's impossible. And again, I say this as somebody\nwho's been so blessed with, with so many things in life, but you know, when I've had challenges or\nthings I've wanted to achieve, I just focus and say, \"What can I do?\" And I'll read everything\nI can get my hands on. I'll if I fail at one, the door\ncloses, I'll try the window. If the window closes,\nI'll try the chimney. If the chimney chose,\nI'll try to dig a tunnel. It's just, if you wanna\naccomplish something, you just have to go at it. And, you know, I think the\nmost important thing I'll say, Sorry, I'm kind of thinking\nmy way into this answer is just do the right thing,\nI think that's also right. And I saw that in my career.\nYou know, be good to people, be honest, do the right thing. And if you do that, I think long term, it does pay off, maybe\nnot in politics, but in the world at large it does. And my hope is in\npolitics it will as well. I wonder if you can comment\non your process of learning in general, 'cause you took on so many new, interesting problems and\napproached them with a first principles kind of approach. So what was your source of information? 'Cause you didn't seem to be\nlistening to the assumptions of the prior experts. You were just taking on the\nproblem in a very pragmatic perspective. How'd you learn about the Middle East? How did you learn about China? How did you learn about Mexico? Like all of these prison reform, all of this that you've\ntaken on and were extremely effective at. - It really started with\njust talking to people. I would try to reach out to\npeople who had been involved in different things and ask\nthem, you know, what they did, what they thought of the problem, who they thought was smart on it, what they read that helped\nthem get a better understanding why they think something had failed. And then I would just, you know, read voraciously on every topic. You know, Washington, it was\nharder to get advice from humans because I found humans\nhad this weird tendency to talk to the media. And so, you know, I talked to somebody and I'd\nask advice and then the next thing I know is the Washington\nPost would call and say, \"Jared's an idiot doesn't\nknow what he's doing, and he's even going to\nthis person to get advice.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I'm asking everyone.\" So books really became\nan amazing guide for me. Ivanka, she, she's an\nincredible researcher. She, she's just voracious. And so she gave me some of my\nbest books and some incredible advice as well, but that\nwas really the, the process. And then I think that was\nkind of the first stage. And then the second stage\nwas just constant iteration, and readjusting plan as you\ncontinue to get more learning. And one story I tell in\nthe book as well is that on my first trip to the Middle East, where I met with Mohammed bin Zayed who I spoke about earlier, the ruler of UAE, I spent\ntwo hours with him asking him questions and really going\nthrough the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the Israeli-Arab issue. And he said to me at the\nend of the meeting, he says, \"Jared, I think you're\ngonna make peace here in the Middle East.\" And I was shocked because I\nmean, first of all, he was, you know, at the time I think some, one of the most respected\nleaders in the region, somebody who I found to be\nvery wise and super thoughtful and experienced, and I said\nto him, \"Why do you say that?\" I was flattered, obviously,\nbut but not certain why he was saying that based on the\nfact that I didn't know what my plan was, I didn't\nknow what I was gonna do, and I had no pathway to make peace. And he said, \"Well, the US usually sends one of\nthree different kinds of people to come see me. He says, \"The first are people who\ncome and they fall asleep in meetings. He said, \"The second are people who come, and they basically read me notes, but have no ability to\ninteract on the message they're there to convey. And then the third have\nbeen people who have come to convince me to do things\nthat aren't in my interests.\" He says, \"You're the first person\nwho's ever come here, and has just asked questions. He says, \"Why? Why have you done that?\" I said, \"Because I figure, you know, this problem's been going\non for a long time.\" You live here, I'll be gone at some point. You're gonna have to live with\nthe consequences of whatever my work is, and the US has a lot of power. And my question is, what would you do if you were\nme and how would you approach this and help me think about it.\" And again, I wasn't gonna then take his\nplan and then execute it, but I thought it'd be very\nprovocative to understand from the people in the region and\ninstructive how they would use the resource and the power\nthat the US had to solve the problems that were having\nsignificant impact on their lives. - Yeah, there's a lot\nof power to the sort of the simplicity of that human\napproach where you're just listening. - Yeah. And one of my\nwishes for society as I leave government, you know, I was living on the upper East\nside in a very liberal echo chamber. I then traveled the country. I met so many people who I\nnever would've met otherwise. On the conservative side,\non the independent side, on so many different issues,\nI think that people benefit. If you have such a strong\npoint of view, I would follow, you know, the John Stewart Mill marketplace\nof ideas and find people who disagree with you and\ndon't call them names, don't say they're a bad person. Say, \"I wanna understand why\nyou feel the way you do. Let's have conversations in this country.\" And I think that that's probably\ngonna be our best way to work through the issues\nthat we have currently."

      "text": "- When you zoom out and look at the 21st century from a human history perspective, across\nthe timescale of many decades, maybe centuries, what gives you hope\nabout human civilization? Everything you've seen,\nyou've traveled the world, you've talked to some of the\nmost powerful and influential people, and you look at the future, what gives you hope about\nthis little planet of ours? What gives me the most hope\nis that anything's possible. If there's one lesson\nthat I took from my time in government. It's that people coming\ntogether to try to make tomorrow different than yesterday can succeed. And if the right people in\nthe right places focus on the right ideas, I think the advancement that\nwe can have for human history and for society can be tremendous. And I think that right now I\nsee we're at a place in society where there's a lot of what\nI call squabbles between countries, which are really\nman versus man issues. And those are as old as time, right? You know, we've been\nfighting about borders or religion or, you know, or, or who wronged somebody\n100 or 1,000 years ago. And these are what I\ncall more tribal battles. But I do think that as we\nadvance with artificial intelligence, as energy becomes cheaper and\nit's more readily available, I think we're gonna have\nmassive industrialization. I think we're gonna have\nmassive advancement. I think in medical and science, we're gonna have cures for diseases. We have the potential in 10, 20 years from now to\nenter a dawn for humanity. That could be incredible. We\ncould become multi-planetary. We can, we can explore\nthe wonders of the world. We can find things we didn't know. So I think that if, if we, we put our energy towards\nfinding these advancements that will improve the lives of,\nof everyone on this planet, instead of figuring out ways\nto have these tensions between us, that, for me is the most optimistic\ncase for what's possible. And the reason why I believe\nit's possible is because somebody with no experience, somebody who all I really\nhad was, was the faith of a leader. And I had the the courage to try. And I went out there with other\npeople and we took on some of the most hopeless, impossible\nproblems and we succeeded. And if we were able to do that, then everyone else should\nbe able to do that as well. - Well, Jared, thank you for\nhaving the courage to try. Thank you for your\nfriendship, for your kindness, most importantly for your\nbook recommendations. And thank you for talking today. This was fascinating eye opening. I hope to have many more\nconversations like this. - Thank you very much, Lex. - Thank you for listening to\nthis conversation with Jared Kushner. To support this podcast, Please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with\nsome words from Mahat Gandhi. \"An eye for an eye will only\nmake the whole world blind.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."

  "full_text": "- The following is a\nconversation with Jared Kushner, former senior advisor to the President during the Donald Trump administration, and author of Breaking\nHistory, a White House memoir. He's one of the most influential\nand effective presidential advisors in modern history, helping conduct negotiations\nwith some of the most powerful leaders in the world and\ndeliver results on trade, criminal justice, reform, and historic progress towards\npeace in the Middle East. On Thursday, October 5th, we recorded conversation\non topics of war and peace, history and power in the\nMiddle East and beyond. This was about a day and a\nhalf before the Hamas attack on Israel, and then we felt we must sit down again\non Monday, October 9th, and add a discussion on\nthe current situation. We open the podcast with a\nsecond newly recorded part. My heart goes out to everyone\nwho has and is suffering in this war. I pray for your strength\nand for the long-term peace and flourishing of the Israeli\nand Palestinian people. I love you all. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" And now, dear friends,\nhere's Jared Kushner. We did a lot of this conversation\nbefore the Hamas attack on Israel, and we decided\nto sit down again, and finish the discussion to address the current situation,\nwhich is still developing. If I may, allow me to summarize\nthe situation as it stands today, it's morning Monday,\nOctober 9th, on Saturday, October 7th at 6:30 AM Israel time, Hamas fired thousands of\nrockets into Southern Israel. The rocket attacks served\nas cover for a multi-pronged infiltration of Israel\nterritory by over 1000 Hamas militants, this is\nshortly after at 7:40 AM. The Hamas militans went door to door in border towns killing\ncivilians and taking captives, including women and children. In response to this, Israeli Air Force began\ncarrying out strikes in Gaza, also fighting on the ground\nin Israel to clear out Hamas militans from Israel territory\nand preparing to mobilize Israeli troops for a potential\nground attack on Hamas and Gaza. Now, of course, this is what\nit appears to be right now, and this along with other\nthings might change, because the situation is still developing. The IDF is ordering civilian\nresidents of Gaza to evacuate their homes for their safety. Benjamin Netanyahu declared\nwar in several statements, and warned Israelis to brace themselves for a long and difficult war. Just today, Israeli\nministers ordered a quote, \"Complete siege of Gaza,\" interrupting supplies of electricity, food, water, and fuel from Israel to Gaza. As of now, October 9th, the death toll is over 1200\npeople and over 130 hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas. So, as I said, the events\nare rapidly unfolding, so these numbers will sadly increase. But hopefully our words\nhere can at least in part, speak to the timeless underlying\ncurrents of the history, and as you write about the\npower dynamics of the region. So for people who don't know,\nGaza is a 25 miles long, six miles wide strip of territory along the Mediterranean Sea. It borders Israel on the\neast and north and Egypt, on the southwest. It's densely populated,\nabout 2.3 million people. And there's been a blockade\nof Gaza by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took power. I could just summarize that\nHamas is a Palestinian militant group, which rules the Gaza Strip. It originated in 1988, and it\ncame to power in Gaza in 2006. As part of its charter, it's sworn to the destruction of Israel, and it is designated by the\nUnited States, European Union, UK, and of course, Israel\nas a terrorist group. - So given that context, what are your feelings as a human being, and what is your analysis\nas the former senior advisor to the president under\nthe Trump administration of the current situation\nin Israel and Gaza? - So, I think you did an\nexcellent job of summarizing a lot of the context, but watching what's unfolded\nover the last 48 hours has been truly heartbreaking to see. We're still in the early\nstages of what's developing, but seeing the images on\nX of, you know, militants, terrorists going door to\ndoor with machine guns, gunning down innocent civilians, seeing beheaded Israeli soldiers, seeing young 20 year olds at a rave, a dance party to celebrate\npeace with militants flying in, and then, you know, shooting machine guns to kill people indiscriminately, seeing young children captive,\nand then held prisoner, seeing 80-year-old grandmothers, a Holocaust survivor,\nalso being taken captive. These are just images and actions that we have not seen in\nthis world since 9/11. This is a terror attack on\nthe scale of which we have not seen, and it's been incredibly\nhard for a lot of people to comprehend. My heart goes out, obviously,\nto all of the families of the victims, to the families of those\nwho are held in captive now, and to all of Israel, because one of the beautiful\nthings about the state of Israel, is that when\none Israeli is hurting, the entire nation comes together. It's a shame that it's taking\nan action like this to unify the nation, but I have seen incredibly\nbeautiful signs over the last 48 hours of a country coming together. The Jewish people have been\nunder oppression before, the Jewish people know what it's like. And seeing people rally together\nto fight for their homeland to try to reestablish safety is a very beautiful thing to watch. I wish it wasn't something\nwe had to watch, but it is. With that being said,\nthough, the backdrop, I've been speaking to friends\nover the last couple days. One friend I spoke with last\nnight who was saying that, a good friend messaged\nhim saying, \"I'm going in. We're gonna do some\noperations to try to free some of the hostages held\nin one of the kibbutz,\" messaged him the next morning. He was one of the first\nthrough the door to try to free these hostages, and he was\nkilled by a Hamas militant. And sadly, we're gonna\nbe hearing many, many more stories of brave Israeli\nsoldiers trying to get these terrorists out of Israel, trying to free innocent\ncivilians who unfortunately are risking their lives to do it. And, you know, they're all heroes, but some will have a less\ngood faith than others, sadly. So it's a very, very heartbreaking moment. And I do think that it's\nvery important at this moment in time for the entire world\nto stand behind Israel. I think that Hamas has shown\nthe entire world who they really are. I think what their aim is,\nwhat they're willing to do, and, all of the strong security that Israel's put in place over the last years, which in some\ninstances was criticized, I think is now being validated, that there was a real\nthreat that they were looking to deter. So, short answer is, my heart\nis broken, praying for peace, praying for strength, praying for praying for Israel\nto do what it needs to do to avoid being in this situation again, which is either eliminating\nor severely degrading Hamas' capabilities. There cannot be peace in\nIsrael and in the Middle East, while there's a terror group\nthat is being funded by Iran that is allowed to flourish\nand is allowed to plan operations that are gonna aim\nto kill innocent civilians. And so, as somebody who was\nformally in this position, who was intimately involved with Israel, with the strategies to\nminimize attacks from Hamas, and to try to turn the region around, and I think we did do\na very substantial job under President Trump. The Middle East went from one\nof the most chaotic regions in the world. You had ISIS in 2016, ISIS had to caliphate the size of Ohio. They were beheading journalists. They were killing Christians. They controlled 8 million people. They were planning\nattacks all over the world from their caliphate. They were using the internet\nto radicalize people. We had the San Bernardino\nshooting in America. We had the Pulse nightclub\nshooting in Orlando, and there was real threat. And then you had Iran, which was given $150\nbillion in a glide path to a nuclear weapon. And they were using their\nnewfound riches to fund Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis,\ndifferent rebels all over the region that were looking\nto destabilize further. Syria was in a civil war where\n500,000 people were killed. Yemen was destabilized,\nLibya was destabilized, and it was just a mess. And all of America's\nallies had felt betrayed. President Trump came into power. We rebuilt the trust and the relationships with all of our traditional allies. We were able to eliminate ISIS,\nthe territorial caliphate, and then we're able to project\nstrength in the region, really go after Iran's wallet. We were able to stop\nthrough crushing sanctions, a lot of their financial resources, which they were using to\nfund all these terror groups. And so we left the Middle\nEast with six piece deals, and a fairly peaceful world. So seeing what's happening, I think it was completely avoidable. I think it's horrible to\nsee that it's occurring, and I pray that those in power\nwill make the right decisions to restore safety, but also to potentially create\na better paradigm for peace in the future. - So I have a lot of\nquestions to ask you about. The journey towards this historic progress towards peace with Abraham, of course. But first on this situation, to step back and some of the history, is there things about the\nhistory of Hamas and Gaza that's important to understand\nwhat is happening now? Just your comments, your thoughts, your understanding of Hamas. - I think you did an excellent job, Lex, of really giving the summary. Just a couple things,\nmaybe I'll add to it, is that Hamas was originally\nfounded from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, which is a group that's\ncaused a lot of issues in the region. They've, they've attacked\nIsrael many times in the past. There's a lot of discussion\nabout how Israel is an occupying power, well, in Gaza, in 2005, they withdrew from all the\nland, and then they say, \"Israel's an apartheid state.\" Well, Israel then gave\ngovernance of the region to the Palestinians. And then what's happened is, is the Palestinian people's\nlives have now gone down, not up since then. I will say that under Hamas'\nleadership in, in Gaza, the people who have suffered the most are the Palestinian people. I've watched cries throughout\nmy time in government from people saying, \"We wanna see the Palestinian\npeople live a better life.\" I agree with those people. I think that the Palestinian\npeople in Gaza are essentially hostages. In Gaza, you have basically, you know, 2 million people that are\nbeing held to hostage by 30,000 Hamas terrorists, and\nthat's really the problem. And I would just encourage people to push their attention\nand energy in this moment, and their anger towards Hamas, those are the people who are\nkilling innocent civilians, who are murdering indiscriminately. And those are the people who\nhave held back the Palestinians from having a better life. And just finally, what I\nwould say is, you know, what we saw with Hamas was\nthat if you go back to 2007, they basically had just\none plan that they did over and over. And, you know, we were very careful to try to\nmonitor very closely and stop the Iranian money and the\nresources from coming in. And again, we took a\nlittle bit of criticism from the international community for keeping the border tight. But unfortunately, every time you'd allow\nconstruction materials to go into Gaza, they'd use 'em to\nbuild tunnels, not homes. You would have equipment that\nwould come in to build pipes, they'd turn it into bombs. So it was very, very hard to figure out how do you get the resources into Gaza to help people live a better life, while at the same, time\nthe leadership in Gaza was taking all those resources, and turning it into military\nequipment to attack Israel. - What role does Iran play in this war in this connection to Hamas? Can you speak to the connection\nbetween Hamas and Iran that's important to understand, especially as this most\nrecent attack unfolds? - Sure. So the correlation, I mean, there's reports that Iran\nis behind the attack. Hamas has thanked Iran for their support. And it's been very well\nknown that Iran supports the destruction of the state of Israel. And I won't say Iran as a country, I'll talk about Iran in the leadership. There's actually a beautiful\nthing I saw on the internet, where one of the soccer games\nin Iran, they were trying to, you know, rally support for\nthe Hamas terror attacks. And a lot of people in\nthe crowds were chanting, FU to the regime, because\nI think the Iranian people, the Persian people generally\nare peace-loving people, who don't wanna see this focus on destruction and annihilation. But you saw this in 2015, 2016, when the Iranian government had resources, the region was less safe. And since, now, there's\nbeen more resources allowed to go to the Iranian regime by lack of enforcement\nof sanctions, and as a result, Iran is funding Hezbollah, Hamas, they were funding the Houthis. Now there's a little bit of a\ndeante between Saudi and Iran, which has led to that going down, which only further proves that\nIran was behind the Houthis, which is what the Saudis\nhad been saying for years, and Iran was denying. So there's a very strong\nrelationship between the two. And we always knew that the\nway that Iran fights wars or fights conflicts is never directly, it's usually through its proxies. And in this case, a Hamas has been a proxy for Iran who\nwanted to obviously see the destruction of Israel, but also does not wanna see the\nIsraelis and the Saudis come together for a peace agreement. - So the name of this operation of the Hamas operation is Al-Aqsa Flood, referring to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. How much of this attack is\nabout the Al-Aqsa Mosque? - In actuality, I don't\nthink any of it is, but the Al-Aqsa Mosque is something that all of the\nShia Jihadists have used for years in order to justify their\nactions that are aggressive towards Israel. So this is something I'll\nmaybe even take a step back and go through. When I was working\ninitially in my first year on the peace plan, I was\ndoing a lot of listening. And quite frankly, a lot of what people were\nsaying to me didn't make sense. And the reason why I was\ntrying to figure out, they were talking about\nsovereignty over Al-Aqsa Mosque. The Al-Aqsa Mosque is\na mosque that's built in the Holy of Holies, the\nHaram ash-Sharif in Israel, where the Jewish beam ash, the holy temple was built\nin a very religious place. After the temple was\ndestroyed, then there was a big mosque built there. And it's one of the more\nholy places in Islam now. So the big thing everyone was saying is, \"What do you do with this land\nwhere you have a mosque built over a very big Jewish site?\" And I was hearing all of\nthe experts, and you know, I always say experts with quotes, because only in Washington\ncan you work on something for a decade and continue to fail, and then you basically leave,\nand are considered an expert. But that's one of the\nproblems with Washington, which maybe we could talk about later. But the notion here was I went and I said, let me try to understand what the issue is with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with the people, right? I always felt the politicians\nwere a little disconnected, so I commissioned several\nfocus groups, one in Oman, one in Cairo, one in\nDubai, and one in Ramallah. And I asked people, Muslims, \"What is the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict about?\" And time and time again, the most popular thing that\nthey said was that Israel was not allowing access to the\nmosque for Muslims to pray. And what was interesting was, is that Israel's policy is to\nallow anyone who wants to come and pray peacefully at the\nsites to come and pray. Sometimes they have security issues when there's provocations. But by and large, since 1967, when Israel was able to take\nback Jerusalem in a defensive war, just to be very clear, they were attacked in the\nSouth and they were attacked from the East. And they basically were able\nto beat back the Jordanians and the Egyptians, and then re-conquer the\nold city of Jerusalem. And during that time, immediately after, Israel then passed the Protection of Holy Places Law, which was, they basically took\nresources they didn't have. And they said, \"We're gonna\nrestore the Christian sites, the Muslim sites, the Jewish sites.\" And they've worked to allow\neveryone access to the mosque. So today, any Muslim who\nwants to come can come and pray at the mosque. The mosque is Israel's\nacknowledge that King Abdullah, the king of Jordan is the\ncustodian of the mosque. And as long as people want to\ncome to the country and pray peacefully, they're able to do that. But if you look at a lot of\nthe propaganda that's been used by ISIS or Iran to recruit terrorists, or to justify their incursions, they often say they're doing\nit in the name of liberating the Al-Aqsa Mosque. But from an operational and\npragmatic perspective today, any Muslim who wants to go to the mosque, you can book a flight to\nIsrael now through Dubai, because there's flights\nbetween Israel and Dubai. And if as long as your country\nhas relations with Israel, and they'll accept your passport in there, you can come and pray, and\nthat's what Israel wants. Israel wants Jerusalem to be a\nplace where all religions can come and celebrate together. But you have a lot of actors\nthat look to find ways to use these religious tensions\nin order to sow division, and justify violent behavior. - I wonder how it's possible\nto lessen the effectiveness of that propaganda message\nthat a lot of the war, a lot of the attacks are about\naccess to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Is there something you can\nspeak to why that message hasn't disseminated across the Arab world? - So Israel's good at a lot of things. They're not very good traditionally\nwith public relations. You know, after the\nAbraham Accords, you know, we made the first Abraham\nAccords deal in August, 2020, and then we made five other deals. We first did United Arab Emirates, then we did a deal with Bahrain, then we did deal with Kosovo,\nthen we did a deal with Sudan, then we did a deal with Morocco, and then we got the GCC deal done as well. The tension between Qatar,\nSaudi, UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain. And that was allowing us to\ncreate a pathway to then pursue the Israeli Saudi normalization. So we had so much momentum then\nthat the goal was just keep getting more countries to\nnormalize relations with Israel. Once you create the connection\nbetween people and create the ability for people\nto do business together, the ability for flights to fly between, then you would just start\nnaturally having people coming. And everyone has a smartphone today. So they can then post and combat the misinformation that's been out there. But the way this misinformation\nis not something that's new. You know, one of the characters who played a very big role in\nspreading the antisemitism, and the violence in Israel in the 1920s was a guy named Hajj Amin al-Husseini, who was known as the\nGrand Mufti of Jerusalem. He was very close with\nHitler and Mussolini, and he was working with them\nto try to get some claims to the Middle East once the\nJewish people were annihilated. And what he did for a very\nlong time was he did the same shtick, only it was before\nyet smartphones and YouTube, where he would say, \"The\nmosque is under attack. These imperialist Zionists are\ncoming in to try to destroy the mosque.\" And he would use that to\nraise money from Indonesia, from Pakistan, from all\nover the world, and then use that threat to justify\nrecruiting groups of young, vulnerable Muslim men, and then, you know, getting them in the\nname of religious rights to go and kill people, which really is more of a\nperversion of the religion than I think the true\nessence of what Islam is. I think Islam at as core,\nis a peaceful religion, and I think that's where a lot\nof the great leaders in Islam wanna take it. But the people who use Islam or the mosque as a justification for violence, those are people who I\nthink are, are really, they're disrespecting the Islam religion. - As you said, you helped make major\nstrides towards peace in the Middle East with\nthe Abraham Accords. Can you describe what it\ntook to accomplish this? And maybe this will help us\nunderstand what broke down, and led to the tragedy this week? - Yeah, so, you know, I always\nbelieved in foreign policy. I learned very quickly\nthat the difference between a political deal and a business\ndeal is that in a business deal, you have a problem set,\nyou come to a conclusion, and then if you buy or sell\nsomething, you either have, you know, more cash or you have a company. So a bit more to do, less to do. Political problem set is very different, where the conclusion of a problem set is essentially the beginning of a new paradigm. So when I would think about how do you move pieces around the\nboard, you couldn't say, \"Let me just solve the problem.\" You have to think about what happens the day after the signing, and how do you create a paradigm\nthat has positivity to it. So the biggest piece of what\nPresident Trump did during his four years in office was\nhe really strengthened the relationship with Israel, number one. And he did things like recognizing\nJerusalem as the capital of Israel. He moved the embassy to Jerusalem, he recognized the Golan Heights, he got out of the Iran deal. We did an economic conference\nin Bahrain, where we brought Israelis to meet with Saudi, and Emirati, and Qatari businessmen,\nand everyone came together. And each one of these instances\nwere unthinkable previously. And everyone said that if you did it, the world was gonna end. And every time President Trump\ndid one, the next morning, the sun rose, the next\nevening, the sun set, and things moved on. And so by doing that,\nwhat President Trump did, was he slaughtered a\nlot of the sacred cows of these false barriers that\npeople had erected and showed people that the vast\nmajority of the people in the Middle East,\nwhether they're Jewish, Muslim, Christian,\nwhatever religion they are, they just wanna live better lives. And so what we basically\ndid was create a paradigm where the voices for peace, the voices for together now\nfinally had a forum where they were able to do it, and\nwe did that in the backdrop. The way we're able to be successful, was we severely limited\nthe resources of Iran, and they were focused more internally, and they couldn't cause the\ntrouble that they were causing everywhere else. Since we've left, obviously,\nthe dynamics have changed, but the way you get to peace\nis obviously number one, through strength, and number two, by finding a way for people\nto be better off tomorrow than they are today. And what I found, was that\nmost of the voices looking for violence or trouble were\npeople who were just focused on what happened two years ago,\n20 years ago, 70 years ago, 1,000 years ago. People who are trying to\nso solve those problems in that context, often\nwe're looking more to use those past grievances as a justification for their power and for the bad behavior that they were looking to perpetuate. - So managing, as we have\ntalked about, extensively, managing the power dynamics of the region, and providing a plan. This is something you did\nwith the economic plan titled, \"Peace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian\nand Israeli People.\" Can you first of all\ndescribe what's in the plan? - Sure. So this was something I took on. I was working on the\npolitical framework between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and trying to understand\nwhat were the issues. And the issues were not very many. It basically was you had a land dispute, so you had to figure out where do you put borders ultimately. You had a security paradigm, which I was much more favorable\nto Israel's perspective on. And obviously the events of\nthe past 48 hours have fully justified that bias. And then in addition to that, you had to deal with the religious sites, but I felt operationally that\nwasn't actually as complicated as people made it, because you wanted to just\nleave it open for everybody. Then I went through, and I,\nI felt that the Palestinian leadership was fairly\ndisincentivized to make a deal, because there was just this paradigm, where for they had billions\nof dollars coming in from the international community. And I think that they feared\nthat if they made a deal, they would lose their\nrelevancy internationally, and the money would stop\nflowing into the country. So what I tried to do is to say, you know, my approach when I would get\ninto a hard problem and say, \"How do I understand all the\ndifferent escape patches? How do I try to eliminate them, and then build a golden\nbridge that becomes really, the only, but also the\nmost desirable pathway for the decision makers to walk through?\" And it wasn't always hard, and sometimes you have to\ngo and hold their hand, or you try to pick 'em\nup and walk 'em across. But, lot of these leaders\nare very reluctant to change. And the dynamics of the\nPalestinians also were such that I think they were fairly\nstuck where they were. So we developed a business\nplan for Gaza, the West Bank. We threw in some improvements\nfor Jordan and Egypt as well. I based it off of the\nvision 2030 that they did in Saudi Arabia, which I thought\nwas a visionary document. I went back through this\nprocess and I studied basically every economic project in\nthe post World War II period. So we looked at what\nthey did in South Korea, why it was successful with some\nstrong industrial planning. We looked at Japan, we\nlooked at Singapore, we looked at Poland,\nwhy it was successful. We spent a lot of time on the\nUkraine plan for the country, and why it wasn't successful. And that was mostly because\nof governance and corruption, which actually resembles\na lot of what's gone wrong with the Palestinians, where\nthere's no property rights, there's no rule of law. And what we did is we built\na plan to show, you know, it's not that hard, right? In the sense that between\nthe West Bank and Gaza, you had 5 million people. And we put together a plan, I think it was about $27 billion. We got together a conference. I had the head of AT&T, we had Steve Schwarzman\nfrom Blackstone came, which was very gracious of them. We had all the leading Arabic businessmen, the leading builders, leading developers. And the general consensus\nof that conference was that this is very doable. You know, we think that\nfor Gaza in particular, it would cost maybe maybe\nseven to to $8 billion to rebuild the entire place. We felt we could reduce\nthe poverty rate in half, we can create over a million jobs there. The only thing that people\nsaid was holding it back wasn't Israel, what was\nholding it back was governance. And eople wouldn't have\nconfidence investing there with the role that that\nHamas was perpetuating. So I encourage people\nactually to look at the plan. It was very thoughtful. It was 181 pages. We went project by project. Each project is costed out. It's a real plan that\ncould be implemented, but you need the right governance. And all of the different Arabic countries are willing to fund it. The international community's\nwilling to fund it, because they've just been\nthrowing so much money at the Palestinians for years, that's never been outcomes\nbased or conditions based. It's just been, you\nknow, entitlement money. And unfortunately, it hasn't\nreally achieved any outcomes that have been successful. So it's a great business plan. It just shows too rebuilding\nGaza, you know, could be easy. But like I said, you know, the problem that's held the\nPalestinian people back, and that's made their\nlives terrible in Gaza, has not been Israel. It's really been Hamas'\nleadership, or lack of leadership, and their desire to focus\non trying to kill Israelis, and start war with Israel over improving the lies\nof the Palestinian people. - And the current approach of Hamas, the more violence they perpetrate, the more they can hold onto power versus improving the lives of people. So they, as you said,\nmaybe you can comment on, they do not propose an economics plan. - I mean, Hamas has been running it now for 16 years and they don't\nhave a lot to show for it. And you know, our posture with them was basically a very simple deal. You know, if you think about\nwhat's the end state in Gaza, it's actually not that complicated. You know, there's no\nterritorial disputes, right? The border's the border. There's no religious issues there as well. You're not dealing with Jerusalem, you're basically just dealing\nwith the fact that, you know, Israel wants to make sure that\nthere's no threat from Gaza. So it's a demilitarization\nor some kind of security guarantee from a credible\nsource where Israel doesn't feel like Gaza can be used to\nstage attacks into Israel, or to fire rockets into Israel. And by the way, these\nare things I was saying, you know, three, four years ago\nthat that was the objective, and that was really the fear, now, that's been proven. Unfortunately, the fear has manifested, and in exchange, you\ncan rebuild the place, and you can give the\npeople a much better life. But Hamas has not shown desire for that, or a capability for that. And I don't think there's enough trust to allow them to do that,\nwhich is why, you know, under the current circumstances, if you do wanna have peace there, Hamas has to be either\neliminated or severely degraded, in terms of their military capabilities. - I would love to ask about leadership, especially on the side\nof the United States. What has the current administration, the Biden administration\ndone different than the Trump administration, as you understand, that may have contributed to\nthe events we saw this week. - So all I can talk about are\nwhere we left them, right? We left them a place where\nthey had tremendous momentum in the Middle East. I met with them during the\ntransition and said, you know, look, you know, we even got\nthe Qatar-Saudi conflict done, no peace between Israel and Saudi would've been possible without that. So we even got that done\nin our lame duck period. And they came in and they said, \"Look, we wanna focus on the three Cs, which is COVID, climate change, and China. And I said, \"That's great,\nbut you know, the Middle East, we have an amazing place right now. It's stable, there's momentum.\" Iran is basically broke. We put such crippling sanctions on Iran that they went from about, I think it was 2.6 million\nbarrels a day of oil they were selling to\nabout 100,000 under Trump. So their foreign currency\nreserves were basically depleted, and they were broke. Same with the Palestinians. We stopped the funding\nto to ra the UN agency, which is totally corrupt. We've put $10 billion in there over time. I did a poll in the Middle\nEast in Gaza to say, \"Okay, we've invested $10\nbillion here as a country. Are we popular? Right? The US had a 7% approval rating. USAID had a 70% approval rating, but it just felt like a waste\nof our taxpayer dollars. And again, we wanted to\nmake it conditions based. The Biden administration\ncame in, number one, they, they started insulting,\nyou know, Saudi and Russia. Oil prices went up at the same time. What they did was they stopped\ndomestic production of oil. They disincentivized a lot\nof oil and shale production with regulations. They stopped pipelines,\noil prices went up. They stopped enforcing the\nsanctions against Iran, probably to get the oil prices lower to make up for what they were doing. They ran to Iran to try to make a deal. They started funding the\nPalestinians again right away. And I even said, you know,\nif you're gonna fund them, if that's your policy,\nI respect that, again, elections have consequences, and you can take a different policy. But what I would recommend\nis get some conditions, make them do some reforms, make them give property\nrights to people, make them, you know, do real economic\ninvestments for people. But they just went right away. So they were funding the Palestinians, not enforcing the sanctions. And then overall, just\nprojecting a lot of weakness in the region. So one of the most embarrassing examples is what happened in the\nUnited Arab Emirates. Again, an amazing, probably one of America's best allies over\nthe last 20, 30 years. They fought with us in Afghanistan. They were the first Muslim\ncountry to stand up and do that after 9/11 because they\ndidn't want it to be a war of the west against the Muslim religion. So they joined the fight, because they saw it as a\nfight between right and wrong. They have rockets shot into their country from from the Houthis. And they basically don't get a\ncall from the US for 17 days. They need their equipment\nthat they buy from the US, which creates job in the US. They need it restocked, we don't call. So they've severely degraded the trust that we had to rebuild with our allies. I think they've been\nworking now to get it back. They, after two years, started working with Saudi and Israel, which I think was good. I think that they realized after a stint, that maybe the process\nthat President Trump had created in the region\nwas the right policy. And keep in mind, you know, President Trump's policy\nthat I was working on, was very strongly criticized\nduring the first three years before we were able to\nachieve the results, because it was departure\nfrom the failed policies of the past. And so first there was\nreturn to those policies, appease Iran, let's\ncriticize Saudi Arabia. Then they started embracing\nand working on the Israel-Saudi deal, which was really exciting. I think we're all very excited about it, but they did it in public. And I think that that also was something, and I didn't have access\nto their intelligence. So I assumed that by doing it so publicly, they thought that they'd\neither had a deal with Iran, 'cause they were letting 'em\nget all this revenue where Iran wouldn't be a problem. But one of the reasons\nwith the Abraham Accords, we kept it so quiet during the whole time, was 'cause we always felt\nlike the troublemakers in the region, particularly\nIran, who we thought would be disadvantaged by having UAE, Saudi, Israel, altogether. Israel's a nuclear power. You have, you know,\nother strong economies. Iran seeks instability. They seek looking to create\ndivision in the region. And if you can create that\neconomic sphere where you have security from Haifa to Muscat, from Israel to Oman all the\nway through with Saudi, Jordan, UAE, Qatar, Egypt, that's an incredibly powerful\nblock, if you can make it secure and then get economic\nintegration that really could be a Middle East that thrive. So Iran obviously wanted\nnothing to do with that, and that's why they've\nbeen working to disrupt. So I think the administration has, they took an incredibly stable\nsituation with momentum. I think they underestimated\nthe way that Iran would approach the region to undermine, I think they gave way\ntoo much rope to Iran. And I think that they didn't\nseize when they had an opportunity of strength with\nthe Palestinians to try to drive to a conclusion that I\nbelieve could have prevented us being where we are today. Not to mention that, you know, even just three weeks ago, I mean, it's a bad look that they,\nthey just basically gave $6 billion to Iran in\nexchange for hostages. And then Iran's basically\nfunding these terror attacks are killing American\ncitizens you have in Israel. And it's a heartbreaking situation. Again, totally avoidable, and one that I think has been\nvery badly mismanaged to date. - If Trump was currently president, you were still working with\nhim on this part of the world, what actions would you take? What conversations would you have? What ideas would you be working with in order to unite the various allies that you mentioned in the Middle East over this tragedy, and\nnot let it be a thing that divides the Middle East, but make it a thing that\ncatalyzes progress towards peace, further progress towards peace? - So I wanna say one thing, Lex, I have a lot of friends\nwho are fans of Trump, who are not fans of Trump. But one thing I wanna say with\nabsolute certainty is that if President Trump was in office, this never would've happened. And when President Trump was in office, anyone who supports Israel or\nwho wants to see, you know, Jewish people not be\ninnocently slaughtered, he would never have\nallowed that to happen. It did not happen when he was in power. And I hope people\nrecognize that as something that's very, very true. How I would play the ball\nwhere it lies right now. Keep in mind we, we transferred the ball, it was on the green, now it's\nalmost like it's gone back, you know, 150 yards and\nit's in a sand trap. I think the way that I would\nplay the ball right now is, number one, is you have to show strength. I actually think President Biden's words were the right words. I see that they're moving\naircraft carriers to the region. Again, the purpose of having\na strong military, I believe, obviously, you know,\nif you get into a war, you wanna win the war. But the purpose of a very strong military, primarily, is to avoid a war. I don't know what kind\nof credibility the Biden administration has to show the strength, but right now, you have to\nsupport Israel completely. You have to really let\npeople in the region know that there'll be consequences\nif they try to escalate again. Again, we saw a little bit of\nrocket skirmish from Lebanon, from Hezbollah. But again, this is the type of\nthing that they have to know there'll be severe\nconsequences if they make this a multi-party fight. And I think sending a\nstrong message to Iran, I think that they have to see\nsome consequences from this, and know that they're not\ngonna be allowed to have a free reign to cause instability\nin that, you know, Iran doesn't usually fight face-to-face. They usually do it through proxies, but let's just all be honest\nabout where this is coming from and let them know that\nthere will be a consequence if they instigate these actions. And again, at least with\nthe Biden administration, they've had contact with Iran, they've been talking with\nIran, but they've allowed Iran, I mean, again, the number I saw last year, I think under Trump, the\nnumber was maybe, like, four or $5 billion of\noil revenue in total. I think last year it was\nsomething like $45 billion in revenue. This year, I think it'll be even more. That's a combination of\nthem driving up oil prices, but also allowing much more sales. You would think that they\nwould find a way to get them to behave and allow them\nto have this happen. Or if that's not the case, then be tough, go back to being tough,\nthat's what you have to do. - Building off of Abraham\nAccords, as you mentioned, Israel, Saudi normalization, there's been a lot of promising\nprogress towards this. What does it take to not\nallow this tragedy damage the progress towards\nIsrael Saudi normalization? - I think right now, it's probably not the best to think about that. I think that we want to think about that after whatever's gonna\nhappen is gonna happen now. I think right now the number\none priority for Israel has to be to fully regain\nsecurity in the country. And then number two is to\nfigure out how you can, like I said, eliminate or degrade the Hamas\ncapability, or other Iranian threats to make sure that you\nhave your security apparatus. I think that the Israeli\nleadership right now should proceed with that. And I don't think that they\nshould be thinking about normalization with Saudi at this moment. My instinct, and I've been watching this\nIsraeli Saudi normalization play out, obviously, just speaking with people, and seeing what I've been reading, and watching with great excitement, I think it would be a game\nchanger for the region. I think it's one of\nIran's worst nightmares to have Israel and Saudi\ninterlinked together. I think it'd be great\nfor the Saudi people, from a security perspective. What they're discussing with\nAmerica would be very strong. The ability to, you know, get different elements\nacross would be incredible. So what I would say with it\nis that the industrial logic held yesterday, and I think\nit will hold again tomorrow. So, you know, I always expect countries\nto act in their interests. I think that the deal that's\non the table right now between Saudi, Israel, and America\nis in Saudi's interests, It's in America's interests,\nand it's in Israel's interest. What's gonna happen now though, is the political dynamics are gonna shift. And I think that, you know, as we've seen with political dynamics, they come and go, I think\nlet's get through this moment, and then I hope at the right time, that those talks will be able to resume, and conclude in an appropriate way. And you know, it's funny, Lex, when I was working on the\nUS-Mexico agreement for the trade, you know, we would have,\nevery day there'd be a tweet that would go out, or\nthere would be an issue. I mean, people forget how intense it was between America and Mexico. And I would speak to my\ncounterpart of Mexico, after a rough day and you know, we were\nworking on something, we were making progress,\nit'd get blown up, and I'd speak to 'em and say, \"You know what, look,\nthey're not moving America. They're not moving Mexico. Let's just, let's stop for today. Let's pick up tomorrow, and let's find a new way\nto bring this forward.\" So I would just encourage\neveryone working on that, not to give up, to keep working hard at\nit, and to find a way. But like I said, I would take a little bit of\na pause for the time being. Let's let the current\nsituation play out, and then, hopefully, there'll be a\nway for it to move forward. - I just hope there's still\npeople on the US side picking up the phone and calling UAE, Saudi Arabia, just as human beings,\nas friends, as allies, and just keeping that channel\nof communication going. Maybe you can correct me, but I just feel like there's\njust simple human dynamics that play out here,\nthat divisions can form, and just run away from you\nover simple misunderstandings, over just the inability to see a tragedy from the same perspective\nbecause of conversations that could have happened,\nbut didn't happen. - I think there'll\ndefinitely be communication, but you know, words on phone\ncalls is worth so much. It's really, you know, trust between people and power. And obviously when you're\nin a position of power, you represent your country\nand your country's interests. But the ability to have trusting\nrelationships where people feel like they're okay taking\nmore risks to help each other, that's actually what's most important. So communication, I\nhope for, but you know, deepening and trusting relationships, that's what I believe makes\nprogress and keeps people safe. - And we talk quite\nextensively about the value of trust and negotiation and just working with leaders, which I\nthink is a fascinating conversation, and you've\ntaught me a lot about that. Let me ask you about the end here. What are the various\ntrajectories this work can take? In your view, what are\nsome of the end states, as you've said, which are\ndesirable and are achievable? - I mentioned this earlier, but whenever I would get a\nproblem set in government, I'd always think through\nfrom a first principle's perspective, what's the\nlogical outcome, right? And forget about all the\nreasons why it can't happen. That's what everyone in\ngovernments always rush to talk about. But I do think here, number one, Israel has to have a secure\nenvironment where they don't feel threatened from Gaza. And number two, is the\npeople in Gaza need to have an environment where\nthey feel like they can live a better life and have opportunities. So that's the end state. And so I think that the\ninternational community should come together. I do think that the people\nwho are usually putting blame on Israel should now realize that maybe they've been\na little bit harsh here, and that Hamas has been as big a threat, if not an even bigger threat\nthan Israel has been saying. And I do think that if the\ninternational community comes together and unites behind Israel, and really forces Hamas,\nand their Iranian backers to stop hostilities,\nto stop saber rattling, to stop misrepresenting the\nhistory in order to justify their violent behavior. And if they say, instead, \"We wanna hold you\naccountable, no more money.\" And they all say that\nthey're gonna stand behind Israel's efforts to eliminate their national security threats, and then we will all come\ntogether and only fund again into a framework that we believe\ncan be a long-term solution where the Palestinian people\nreally have a chance to live a better life, that's really\nthe best way to get there. There's tons of complicated factors, but that's the end state\nthat the global community should be looking to come together. And it's very achievable. It's very, very achievable. - As we stand here today, there's a lot of different\nways that this war can evolve. If a ground invasion happens\nby Israeli forces of Gaza, and if the number is correct\nof 100,000 Israeli soldiers, do you worry about various trajectories that can take of the\nconsequences that might have of an unprecedented ground troop attack? - Yeah, so I think as a leader, you know, you can't change yesterday, but you have the ability\nto change tomorrow. And that's a very important fundamental, I mean, that's true for all\nof us, not just leaders. But, you know, we saw with 9/11, how America was caught off\nguard by a terrorist attack. We acted somewhat rationally,\nsomewhat emotionally, which led to a 20-year war\nwith trillions of dollars lost, I think almost a million lives lost, not just American, but all lives. And it was a total tragedy what occurred. I think, right now, the\ntemptation is to be strong. I think that that's a necessity. I do think eliminating risk\nis the right objective. I think the goal should be\nto stay very clear about what the objective is, but also this attack\nwas very well planned. Not to walk into another trap. I think you have to be\nvery smart, very cautious. I've been happy to see that\nwhat they've been doing in retaliation so far has\nbeen somewhat measured, and they've taken their time to try to assess what's achievable. Again, I don't have access\nto the intelligence, and you know, we're talking\nat a very early stage in this conflict, so a lot could happen even by\nthe time this is published. But my hope is that they'll just stay very focused on what the objective is, and try to make sure that they're acting appropriately in order to do that. And I will say this too, that this has been different\nthan what I've seen in the past in that the\nattacks were so heinous, and so disgusting that I've\nseen the international community rally around Israel more\nso than I ever have. And I hope that Israel\ncontinues to keep the moral high ground and continue to\ncommunicate what they're fighting for, why they're fighting. And I do hope that the\ninternational community supports the objective, and they can\nwork together to achieve it. - BBenjamin Netanyahu, Bibi, somebody you've gotten to\nknow well in negotiation, in conversation, he has made statements, he has declared war, he has spoken about this\npotentially being a long and difficult war. What have you learned about\nthe mind in Benjamin Netanyahu that might be important to understand here in this current war? - Bibi is definitely a historic figure. You know, I'd meet with a lot\nof different world leaders, and some of 'em, I would say they're very, very special transformational figures. And some, I would say, \"How\nthe hell is this person running a country?\" And Bibi's somebody who has done a lot for the state of Israel. He has a tremendous understanding\nof the security apparatus. He has tremendous global relations. So for a crisis like this, I think Bibi's the leader you want, if you're Israel to be in that seat. I think he's ambitious in what\nhe's gonna look to achieve. He understands his role in\nhistory as somebody who's helped strengthen Israel\neconomically, militarily. And I don't think he wants to\nsee his legacy be somebody who left Israel more vulnerable\nthan it had to be. So I think in that regard,\nhe'll be incredibly strong, but I also think that he'll\nhopefully be calculating in the risks that he takes\nand not create more risk than is needed, and that's\neasy to say, you know, the two of us sitting here\nhaving a conversation, when you're sitting in that chair as a leader in the fog of war, it's a very hard decision to make. He's been here before. He knows the weight of the situation. I'm sure he knows the moment. And I pray that he'll do what's right here to bring the best outcome possible. - I wonder if you can comment on the internal political turmoil that Bibi has been operating in, and how that relates to\nthe tragedy that we saw. - On the one hand, the\npolitical turmoil is, it's a sign of a vibrant democracy. I think it's been actually\nnice to see how people have fought for their country and their beliefs in a democratic way. You compare that to the\nPalestinians where there's no democracy, there's no free\nspeech, there's no free press, you know, you can't disagree\nwith the leadership. You know, in Israel, if you wanna be homosexual, you can have a go to a\nparade and live your life. In Gaza, they'll throw you\noff a building and kill you. So in Israel you have the freedoms, which I think make it a special\nplace and you have a very vibrant democracy. With that being said, you know, the times in Jewish history\nwhere the Jewish people have been most vulnerable have been\nwhen there's been division, and that's when the temple is destroyed. But that's not just with the\nJewish people and with Israel, that's in all societies. So I definitely believe that\nthis division has left them less prepared for the\nsituation than it would. I do think there's real lessons\nwe should be taking from this here in America where we're in a time where we're very divided. But I do think that it'd be\nvery wise for our leaders to find the areas where we do agree and find ways to, you know, secure our southern border\nto make sure that we know who's in our country,\nwhat risks we all face. And I do think that that\ndivision definitely creates risk for countries. - Let me switch gears here and\njust zoom out and look at our society and our public\ndiscourse at the moment. What do you make of the scale\nand nature of the Palestinian support online in response\nto this situation? - This is something I've\nobserved over the years since I got involved with the\nIsraeli-Palestinian issue. With a lot of interest, I think a lot of the people\nwho are pledging support for the Palestinian people, I think that they wanna\nsee the Palestinian people live a better life. And I actually agree\nwith them in that regard. Unfortunately, I think many of them are\nincredibly ill-informed as to the facts on the ground. I think all of the people\nwho are advocating online for the Palestinian people, who are going to these\nmarches in support of them, I think they'd be best served\nif they really care about effectuating the outcome of\njoining with Israel right now and directing their anger\ntowards the Hamas leadership. I think that it's very\nclear that the group that's responsible for\nthe Palestinian people living the lives that all of\nthese people are angry about is Hamas. And if they direct their\nanger towards Hamas, and put the attention on\nthe failings of Hamas, and put forth a vision for what they'd like to\nsee leadership in Gaza do, and they respect that there's\na real fear that Israel has, and any country would have of\nhaving a group of terrorists next to them that's calling\nfor their destruction. I think that that recognition\nof finding a way for Israel to be secure and then\nhaving an opportunity for the Palestinian people\nto live a better life is the right pathway to try and pursue. - So to you, there's a clear distinction between Hamas and the Palestinian people. In that Hamas is the enemy of progress, and the flourishing of\nthe Palestinian people. - 100%. It's very, very clear. And I think that if people were\nhonest about the situation, if they spent the time to\nreally understand it, again, you know, if you follow the\nconference I did in Bahrain, we had all the leading\nbusinessmen there, and they said, \"We can rebuild Gaza very\neasily, we all want to.\" The leading Arab businessmen, the leading American\nbusinessmen, everyone wants to, they're just held back by Hamas. And so I do think having an\nhonest conversation about this at this point in time has\nreally only one logical conclusion. And my hope is that maybe\nthis conflict leads to that conversation being had. And if it is, then maybe that brings more\nunity and understanding, and we kind of get to a conclusion better that could improve the lives of the Palestinian people. - Pragmatic question about the future. Do you hope Donald Trump wins in 2024? And how can his administration help bring peace to the Middle East? - I think when Donald Trump was president, we had a peaceful world. Everyone said if he was elected, we would have World War III. Meanwhile, he gets elected, and he not only is the\nfirst president in decades to not start any wars,\nhe's making peace deals, he's making trade deals,\nhe's working with our allies, getting them to pay\ntheir fair share in NATO. He's having a dialogue\nwith China, with Russia, he's weakening Iran. And so I do think that the\njob he did as a foreign policy president was tremendous. I think, you know, now,\nmore and more people are starting to recognize that. Again, under President Biden this is the second war that's\nbroken out in the world. And when you have a weak\nAmerican leadership, the world becomes a less safe place. And so my hope and prayers\nare that President Trump is reelected and that he's able to then restore order, and calm,\nand peace, and prosperity to the world. - [Lex] From a place of strength. - That's the only way\nhe knows how to do it. - What gives you hope about\nthe future of this region of Israel and of the Middle East? - The Middle East for 20\nyears was an area of conflict. They spent all their money\non bullets and bombs. - You have young leadership\nnow in Saudi Arabia and UAE, and Qatar, and there's a\nmuch more ambitious agenda now for the region to make\nit an economic superpower, and hub of the world. Israel is one of the most\nburgeoning and exciting tech economies in the world. And if you think about it, it's almost like having Silicon Valley not connected to California. The thing that's held the\nregion back for all these years has just been the\nconflict and the division, and the lack of connectivity. But if you have that region, and if it can all come together, if you can create a security architecture, you have an incredibly young population, you have a lot of wealth and resources, and a lot of capabilities and know-how. And so I think that if\nit's managed correctly, and if Iran is, is, is\nable to be restrained, and suppressed with\ntheir ambitions to cause destabilization. I don't mean Iran, the country,\nI mean the Iranian regime. Because actually once you\nhave this economic sphere, if you could bring Iraq into it, if you could bring Iran into it, that makes it even bigger and stronger. And the Persian people are\nincredibly entrepreneurial, and incredibly industrious. So I do think that the region\nhas tremendous potential. It's just been held back by\nbad policy, bad leadership, bad objectives. And again, you know, when President Trump left office in 2021, the Middle East was really on a very, very positive trajectory. And if the right things happen,\nit can continue to be so. So, I'm praying at this moment\nin time that we navigate the current crisis, that the important objectives\nare achieved of eliminating the terrorists and their threats, and then allowing the leaders\nwho are focused on giving their citizens and their\nneighbors the opportunity to live a better life, are able to work together, and really dream, and be ambitious, and find ways to create a paradigm where humans can flourish. - What is the best way to\ndefeat hate in the world? - Hate is is a very powerful force, and it's much easier to\nhate people you don't know. It's funny, when I was\nworking on prison reform, one of the most interesting\npeople I met was a reverend, actually down in Texas who\nnegotiated the first truce between the bloods and the Crips, two of the notorious gangs\nin America, in prison. And I was very excited to meet him. And when I met him, I said,\n\"Well, how'd you do it?\" And he said, \"It was very simple.\" He says, \"I got all the guys together, and I had a tremendous amount\nof barbecue brought in. He says, \"And I got them meeting.\" He says, \"No drinking.\" Says, \"Drinking sometimes gets people a little bit more against\neach other,\" he says, but I got a meeting, and they\nstarted sitting down together and they started saying, \"You know what? You're just like me.\" And all of a sudden, they\nstarted finding areas where they were more together. Look, I've traveled\nall over the world now. I've been very fortunate to\nmeet people from different states in America. I have different political persuasions, different ages, different classes. And what I found is that\nthere's a fundamental driving amongst all of us where we\nall wanna live a better life. And, you know, people don't\nwanna fight naturally, but it's easy to fight\nwhen you feel wronged, or you feel like somebody\ndisrespected you, or somebody did something from hatred. And hatred leads to more hatred, which sometimes just pushes\nthat cycle further and further. So I believe that each and\nevery one of us has the power to stop that cycle. And we don't do it by being on Twitter, and yelling at people. We don't do it by just being critical. We do it by finding the\npeople we disagree with, by listening to them, by asking questions, by sitting with them. And then if we each take\nresponsibility to try to make the world better, then I think that there's no\nlimits to the incredible place that this world can be. - So as, as you've said, you've traveled all across the world. Do you think most people are good? Most people have love in their heart. - I do believe that, yeah. And you have some bad people. I mean, you have some real evil people. I mean, a big part of the work\nI did was on prison reform, you know, previously, the mentality was, is that the prison should\nbasically be a warehouse for human trash. And if you've made a\nmistake in this world, then we're gonna throw you out, and we're gonna make the\nrest of your life incredibly difficult because you're\ngonna have a criminal record, you're not gonna have access to jobs. But what I found is when I\nwould sit with people in prison, the people I've met through\nmy father's experience, and who I met along the\nway is that, you know, people make mistakes. We're all human. I think it's the right thing\nfrom a religious perspective to give people second chances. I always believe you shouldn't\njudge people by the worst mistake they make in their life. Unfortunately now, in\nthe era of social media, people will say one wrong thing, it sticks with them forever. They get canceled or they get put out. We're all humans, we\ngrow from our mistakes, we learn from our mistakes. And I think that some\npeople are just just evil. There are some evil people,\nbut I do think the vast, vast, vast majority of people are good. And I do think that people\nsometimes also can be in a bad place and then society can\npush 'em to a worse and worse place, but we all have the\npower to make them feel loved, make them feel heard. And and I think there's also\ntremendous power that we have as people to help people\nget to a better place. And so, you know, my wife and I, we've always tried to be a force for good. We've always tried to be, you know, we've always tried to provide\na place where people can discuss with each other. When we were in Washington, we would host dinners at\nour house all the time, or we would have Democrats and\nRepublicans sitting together. I saw a Senator Feinstein\njust passed away. We had a great dinner at her\nhouse when she was senator with her and her husband and Mark Meadows, when he\nwas on the Freedom Caucus. And we had actually a fascinating\ndiscussion about Iran. Mark was much more hard line than me. I had to actually bite my tongue. I was impressed at how much he did. Whereas, you know,\nFeinstein and her husband were like super into, you know,\nthey knew the Iranians well. They thought they were peace loving, and it was an incredibly\nrobust and respectful debate. And so I don't think we maybe\nconcluded anything that night, but it was interesting for\npeople to get together. Having a dinner at my house\nwhere I had Dick Durbin, you know, the number two\nranking Democrat in the Senate, Lindsey Graham, and Steven Miller, who's known to be a very\nhard line on immigration, discussing what an immigration\nreform could look like. I mean, they left that\ndinner saying, \"Wow. We hadn't spoken to\npeople on the other side. And we actually agree\non like 85% of things. Maybe something is possible.\" And so I believe that we should always be trying to push to make\nthe world a better place. And you only do that\nby listening to people, and connecting with people,\nand by respecting people. And, finally, I'll just say\non this is that, you know, I meet people all the time\nwho have so much confidence in their perspectives,\nand I'm very jealous that these people are able to\nbe so confident about every single thing, because\nfor me, I have, you know, some degree of confidence in\nthe things that I've studied and what I've learned, but\nI'm always trying to find people who disagree to kind\nof sharpen my perspectives, and to help me grow, and\nto help me learn further. And so I think that's kind\nof the beauty of the world, is that, you know, the knowledge\nbase continues to grow, the facts continue to change, and what's possible tomorrow\ncontinues to become different. And so as humans, we have\nto continue to thrive, to learn, and to grow, and to\nconnect, and if we do that, everything's possible. - Well, Jared, thank you for\nyour compassion, first of all, but also your wisdom today\non this very difficult, this tragic set of events, these difficult days for the world. It's a big honor to speak with you again. Every time I speak to you, I learned a lot about the world, and I deeply appreciate, like I said, your humility, and your\nunderstanding of the details of all the complex power dynamics, and human dynamics that\nare going on in the world. Once again, thank you for talking today. - Thank you. And Lex, if I could say\njust one final thing, which is that my thoughts and\nprayers are really with all of the people in Israel,\nand the innocent civilians as well from the Palestinian side. And my prayers are with the\nIDF soldiers that they should be safe and they should\nbe really watched by God to accomplish whatever mission will enable to make the world a safer place. Thank you for listening to\nthis newly recorded segment of the conversation that\naddresses the current situation in Israel and Gaza. And now, we go on to the\nsecond part of the conversation recorded on Thursday, October 5th. Given your experience in\nnegotiating with some of the most powerful and influential\nleaders in the world, what's the key to negotiating\ndifficult agreements in geopolitics? Start with a big question. - If I look back on the\ndifferent negotiations I had when I was in government, either\nwith leaders of countries, with representatives of leaders, or even with members of\nCongress to pass legislation, the most important thing\nI would draw back to would be trust. I think getting to know each other, understanding what was motivating\nthe other party to get to the outcome and making\nthem feel like you weren't going to use whatever information they gave you to benefit yourself at the expense of them is\nprobably what I would call table stakes, to have a shot\nat accomplishing anything that was hard in negotiation. After that, I would say taking maybe a first\nprinciples approach to what the outcome of whatever\nproblem you're looking to solve should be. Now you have different\nkinds of negotiations. I always try to create a\nframework in the negotiation where it wasn't me against you, it was always let's agree\non what the outcome is that we're trying to accomplish. Let's all sit on the same\nside of the table and say, \"We want to get to this outcome. How do we get there?\" Really trying to create a roadmap. And so once you understand the\ndestination you want to get to the endpoint, then you'd have to work\nbackwards and really try to put yourself in their shoes and\ntry to understand what were their motivations macro. Most of the time you had to\nassume that a leader's primary objective was to stay in power. And so all decisions made\nwould be made through the framework of what it\nwould take to do that, and how it would impact\ntheir ability to do that. And then finally, I would just\nsay that in any negotiation, you have to understand the\npower dynamics as well. And you have to then wait your\napproach in order to maneuver pieces to accomplish the objective. And so in areas where we\nhad stronger power dynamics, I'd always look at it and say, \"What are the potential escape\nroutes where a politician would say, 'This is just the reason why we can't get there.'\" And I'd always think, \"How can you try to eliminate\nthose escape routes, or make them much harder to accomplish?\" And then, ultimately, think\nabout what's the golden bridge that you wanna create for them\nin order to get to the other side where they were\nmotivated to get there, because it was in their\nself-interest to get there, but also because it helped accomplish the different objective. And I have many examples that\nI lived through with that. Obviously, negotiating in\ncongress for prison reform, I had to form a lot of\ntrust with Democrats, whether it was Hakeem\nJeffries or Dick Durbin. And then also on the Republican\nside with, I had Mike Lee, I had Lindsey Graham, I had\nTim Scott, Senator Grassley, and then also Doug Collins\nin the house was tremendous. And you know, every time\nwe maneuvered something, we would get attacked\neither from the left. There's a time we were being\nattacked by Nancy Pelosi, John Lewis, for not being,\nyou know, inclusive enough. And then there were times\nthat we maneuvered it, we'd be attacked from the\nright for maybe going too far. And ultimately we had to\nfind just the right place where we can get it done. And the same thing happened with USMCA, where we were negotiating\nthe biggest trade deal in the history of the world, which was $1.3 trillion in\nannual trade between Mexico, Canada, the United States of America. And we were able to form good\ntrust with the other side, and try to say, \"How do we\ncreate win-win outcomes?\" And ultimately we're able to\ndo something in a record time that people thought was very hard to do. And both of them in a\ndivided time of the Trump administration were bipartisan wins, with big, big votes in\nthe Senate and the house. - You have a lot of stories of this kind, sometimes a soft approach,\nsometimes a hard approach. There's, I think a story where would Bibi, there was a potential, like,\na dramatic election coming up, and you have to say, no, no excuses, no delaying, we\nhave to make this agreement.\" I know Bibi caress about\nIsrael more than the particular dynamics of the election. Like you have to draw a hard line there. - But in fairness too,\nlike, you know, for him, during the time that we\nwere dealing with him, he was always an election versus election, and then election and you know, what he was saying wasn't wrong. And I think he was more\nexpressing his concerns, given the dynamics. And you know, we never held\nthose concerns against him. We just said those are\nreal concerns he had. We respected those concerns, but then we helped him\nprioritize to help accomplish the right things. And that's ultimately what\nthe partnership is, right? My job was to represent America. His job was to represent Israel, and you had other parties\nrepresenting their own interests. And as long as you assume that, you know, people were acting mostly in good faith, you were able to navigate\nareas where you didn't have complete overlap of\npriorities and objectives. - Just to go back to the trust thing, you sometimes see that with leaders, where it looks like they're\ntrying to screw over the other person when they're talking. And so not having that I think\nis a really powerful thing for earning trust. People actually can\nbelieve that results driven are working towards a certain end. Is there a skill to that? Is that genetics, you're born with that, or is that something you develop? So basically, it requires\nyou to look at the game of politics and not have a\nkind of cynicism about it, to where everybody's\ntrying to manipulate you, and actually just go in\nwith a kind of open mind, and open heart and actually\nspeak truthfully to people, like, on of basic human level. - I would say that I always\nwould think about, \"How can I be a partner to others, like I would want somebody\nto be a partner to me?\" And a lot of it comes from\njust my different experiences in business. I've had great partners, I've had terrible partners. My father, you know, again,\na lot of my childhood was I was exposed to business. My father, on Sundays he\nwould take us job sites, and to the office with him\ninstead of to football games, like my friends' fathers would do. And so we were exposed to business. And what he would say about his father who was an immigrant to America, came over with nothing,\nhad no formal education, but he would always say, \"A good deal with a bad partner will always be a bad deal. And a bad deal, good partner,\nyou'll figure it out.\" And so, going through\nsome of the challenges, and that I had in my life\nearly on, whether it was the issue with my father that\nI'm sure we'll talk about, or even going through some\ntougher financial times during the great financial crisis, I really learned a lot about partnership. And I always thought, \"How can I act in a way where\nI could be the type of partner or friend to others that I\nwish others would be to me?\" - So when you look for a good partner, don't you think there's the\ncapacity for both good and bad in every person? So when you talk, when you negotiate with\nall of these leaders, aren't there like multiple\npeople you're speaking to inside one person that you're\ntrying to encourage, catalyze, like, the goodness in the human? - Yeah. So, leaders are generally\nchosen by their country. And so my view was, if I had an objective, I didn't get to choose who was the leader of other countries. My job was to deal with that leader, understand their strengths,\nunderstand their weaknesses, understand their power dynamics as well. You know, one of my greatest\ntakeaways when I grew up, I'd read the newspapers\nabout all these powerful, famous people. And then as I got older and\nhad the chance to meet them, and do business with them,\nand then ultimately, you know, interact with them in government, as I realized that they're\njust like you and me, they wake up every morning,\ntheir kids are pissed at them, their wife doesn't want to talk with them. And they've got a set\nof advisors around them, one saying, \"Let's go to war,\" one saying, \"Let's make peace.\" One saying \"Do the deal.\" One saying \"Don't do the deal.\" And they're all thinking,\n\"Where do I get advice? How do I make decisions?\" And so understanding the true\nhuman nature of them and then the different power dynamics around them, I thought was very key. And so I didn't have a choice,\ndo I deal with them or not, it was a function of how do\nyou deal with them effectively, in order to find areas where\nyou have common interests, and then work well together to pursue those common interests in order\nto achieve a certain goal. - First of all, you're\nincredibly well read. I've gotten to know you and\nI've gotten to know Ivanka, and the book recommendation\nlist is just incredible. So first of all, thank you for that. You told me about \"The Guns\nof August\" by Barbara Tuckman. It's a book on World War I, and I went down a whole rabbit hole there. She's, like, an incredible historian. But anyway, there's a bunch of\nstuff you learned from that, but one of the things you\ntold me is it influenced your general approach to diplomacy of just picking up the\nphone, and giving it a try. So as opposed to planning\nand strategizing, just pick up the phone. - So this was a book I read way before the notion\nof serving in government was ever even on my mind or reality. And I remember thinking\nabout it, reading it, and thinking how World War I started, where you had, somebody was assassinated, and then you had all\nthese different alliances that were created. And then in order to\naccomplish objectives, it triggered all of these\npeople getting in bed with everyone else because of documents that were created without the intent of going to a massive war. And I think in the course of World War I, it was one of the greatest\natrocities that we've seen as humanity. We've had 16 million\npeople killed in that war. And I was reading the book, I remember thinking to\nmyself, even though, you know, things are set in a certain\nway, go sit with somebody, go talk to them and say,\n\"This doesn't make sense. This is wrong. How do we create a better pathway?\" And as a civilian all my life, you know, I would read the newspapers, I would observe how\ndifferent leaders would act. But when we had the opportunity\nto serve in government, and have the position, you\nrealize you're not a civilian. You don't have the luxury of sitting back, and letting the world happen\nthe way it's happening. You have agency and you have\nthe potential to influence the outcome of things. And one thing I've seen is, you know, most political prognosticators are wrong. Anyone who tells you what's\ngonna happen really has no clue. And it's not because they're\nbad or they're not intelligent, it's because nobody knows.\nAnd at the end of the day, the outcomes in the\nworld are usually driven by the decisions of humans. And if you're able to come\ntogether, form relationships, listen to each other, you can do that. And one of the great examples\nthat I speak about in the book is with North Korea, whereas\nif you remember in 2017, it was very intense when President\nObama was leaving office, he told President Trump\nthat the single biggest fear that he had, and this is a\ntime when the world was a mess. The Middle East was on fire, ISIS was beheading journalists\nand killing Christians. They had a caliphate the size of Ohio. Libya was destabilized,\nYemen was destabilized, Syria was in a civil war where\n500,000 people were killed. Iran was on a glide path\nto a nuclear weapon. Yet the single biggest fear\nhe had was North Korea. And then it got compounded\nby the fact that we get into office and President Trump\nbrings his generals around, and he's learning how to interact with all the generals and says, \"Okay, what are my options?\" And they said, \"Calm down. We've been using all of our\nammunition in the Middle East, we don't have enough ammunition\nto go to war over there.\" And he says, \"Let's not\nlet that be too public. Let's try to restock,\nand come up with a plan.\" At the time, there was a lot\nof banter back-and-forth. I got a call from a friend\nwho was an old business contact who actually had\ndone business in North Korea. And he said, \"I'd love to\nfind a way to solve this.\" And I was getting calls from\nfriends at the time saying, \"I'm trying to go to Hawaii for vacation. Should I not be going, is it not safe?\" I mean, forget this\npsychology of how intense that was at the time. And then through that interaction, he called some of his\ncontacts in North Korea. And then we were able with the CIA, to open up a back channel\nthat ultimately led to the deescalation, the meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un which led to a deescalation. So that was really the mindset, which was, whenever there's a problem, just pick up the phone and try. And I think President Trump\nhad a very similar approach, which was, let's give it a shot. And he wasn't afraid to go\nafter the hard ones too. And I'll say one final thing on this, which is that in politics, the incentive structure\nis just much different than in the real world, right? In the sense that you have a hard problem, than if you try to solve a hard problem, the likelihood of failure is great. Whereas in the business world, if you're going after a hard problem, we celebrate those people, right? We want our entrepreneurs\nand our great people. to go after solving the big hard problems. But in politics, if you try\nto take on a hard problem, you have a high likelihood of failure, you'll get a lot of\ncriticism on your pathway to trying to accomplish that if you fail. And then if you fail, it has a higher probability\nof leading to you losing your opportunity to serve. And so it's just one of these\nthings where people wanna play it safe, which is not the\nnotion that really was taken during the time that\nPresident Trump was in office. - Do you think it has to be that way? I think there's something\nin the human spirit, like, in the public\nthat desires politicians to take on the big, bold problems, right? Why is it that politicians need\nto be so afraid of failure? - I don't think it has to be that way. And that's, I think,\none of the great lessons from the time and of the\nTrump administration. He brought a lot of people from the business world into government. The business people have\na much different mindset than government people. And there was a lot of resistance. And I think part of why\nthere was so much resistance was because, I think about\nit from my personal sense, was that if I was successful\nwith no traditional qualifications to do diplomacy, it meant that all the people\nwith traditional qualifications and diplomacy didn't necessarily\nneed those qualifications in order to be successful. And that same sentiment\nmanifested itself in many areas in government. And I think that in the business world, it's outcome oriented,\nit's results oriented. And you know, what we would\nsee in New York, is there, they would stab you in the eye, in DC they would stab you in the back, and it just became a whole different-\n- Good line. - Dynamic of how you work\nthrough these different areas. So the answer is it doesn't\nhave to be that way. You just need the right courageous leader. And that's why I'm so\noptimistic about what the future of America and the world could be, if you have the right people in power, who are willing to take\non the right challenges, and do it in the right way. - If we just linger on the\nNorth Korea and the deescalation and the meeting, what's\nthe trajectory from this could be the most catastrophic thing that destroys the world,\nto you find back channels, you start talking, and\nstart arranging the meeting. Is there some insights you\ncan give to how difficult that is to do in that,\nin the North Korea case, which seems like to be one\nof the more closed off parts of the world, and in the other\ncases that you worked on? - Yeah, it's always very challenging, and especially when you're\ngoing against the grain of what's established, right? We did something different\nto think that an old business contact that I had could then do it. I mean, that's the type\nof thing that, you know, if the press knew what we were doing, they would've derided it, and criticized it in every which way. But that was one of the\nbenefits of operating very much below the radar, is that we were able to try\nall these different things. And not all of them worked,\nbut some of them did. But that is what's amazing\nabout the world, right? This could be the biggest story\non the front page of every paper, and they're\ninciting fear in everyone, and it's not illegitimate fear. I mean, there were\nmissile tests over Japan. You had a lot of very big\nchallenges with that file. And then all of a sudden we make contact, we go through a negotiations\nto set a meeting, there's a meeting between\nPresident Trump and Kim Jong Un. And then all of a sudden, there's a framework to try\nand move things forward. And again, I think that there's a lot\nof possibility there for what could happen if it's\nworked in the right way. - I just wanna know how\nyou worded that first email or text message, like\nwhat emojis to use, like, the hugging emoji. It's just personally I've\ngotten to know a lot of powerful and rich people and just, it's\nfunny that they're all human, just like you're saying. - And a lot the drama,\na lot of the problems can be resolved with just\nlike a little comradery, a little kindness, a little, like, just actually\njust reaching out and talk. - We're all human beings, and people wanna be successful,\nand people wanna be good. And and you're right too. there's way more emojis involved\nin diplomacy than I ever would've expected, but-\n- And every leader I'm sure has their favorite emoji. This is what I learned about people, everybody has their go-to emoji. I usually go to the heart\nvery quickly, emoji. There's some people who go\nthe hugging, whatever that, where you're, like,\ndoing the hugging thing. Anyway, this conversation\nquickly turned to the ridiculous, but to do another book reference, you mentioned the book\n\"Thirteen Days in September\" by Lawrence Wright in\ndiscussing all the work you've done in in Israel\nand the Middle East. I just wanna ask you sort\nof the interesting aspect of that book, which is the influence of the personalities and\npersonal relationships on these negotiations. You kind of started to allude\nto that with the trust, but how much do the\npersonalities matter in this? So going from North Korea\nto the Middle East here, to within Congress, and\nall that kind of stuff. - Yeah, completely in every way. I mean, that's an incredible book, and it's a very entertaining read. It has, obviously, a lot\nof good historical context on some of the key players, whether it was Anwar Sadat, or Manam , or Jimmy Carter and, and, and Sance and, and a lot of the others who were involved with those negotiations. And the thing that I kind\nof took from that experience was just how personal it was. And again, one of my favorite stories from that book was how Anwar Sadat, who was a big, big\nleader, he had a mystic, who was, according to\nthis book, again, history, I like reading it, but I always, you know, realize that you have to\nnotice that this is just the perspective of a given\nauthor that's writing it. But the way that they write this book, was that he had an\nadvisor who was a mystic, and the mystic was having a\nback channel with the Israelis, and the mystic told Sadat, if you go to Israel and you\nmake a speech at the Knesset, bacon is ready to give you the Sinai. And so he goes to Israel,\nthey set this whole thing up, he goes and gives the Knesset, they go for their meeting\nafter, and Sadat says, \"Okay, well, are we gonna do this thing? And Vegas says, \"What\nare you talking about? I'm not giving you an inch of our land.\" And it was just one of\nthese things where it was a miscommunication that brought about the symbolic visit of\nAnmar Sadat to Israel. And that was one of these\nnotions that just made everyone think that something was\npossible that they thought was impossible a moment before. And actually, we had an example\nlike that during our time in government, when we\ndid the Abraham Accords. The first step of the accords\nwas really a phone call between President Trump,\nPrime Minister Netanyahu, and Mohamed bin Zayed, who at that point, was the crown prince and\nde facto ruler of the UAE. But all we had was a phone call, and then a statement that was released. And what was interesting\nafter that is we said, \"Okay, well how do we integrate countries? Nobody's done this in a long time.\" And we were trying to\nfigure out all the issues, and there's big miscommunications\nbetween Israel and UAE, and we were navigating\nthrough all the issues. And so after a couple weeks,\nI said, \"You know what? I've gotta go over there and try to sort through these issues.\" So we make a plan to go to Israel, then we can go to UAE. And then a young gentleman\nwho worked with me, named Avi Berkowitz, says, \"Well, if we're\nflying from Israel to UAE, instead of flying on a government plane, why don't we see if we\ncan get an LL plane, and we'll do the first\nofficial commercial flight?\" And so I said, \"That's a great idea.\" Let's call, you know,\nambassador Otaiba Yousef, who was a tremendous player\nin the Abraham Accords working behind the scenes, day and night, and was really a big catalyst. So he calls Yussef and he\nsays, \"Sure, no problem. Let's give it a shot.\" So we go and we do it and he says, \"If we can work at these\nissues, we'll do it.\" So we go to Israel, we do our meetings, we get everything back into a good place. We set up this trip over, we fly on an LL plane, we fill it up. At the time, it was during\nCOVID with a health delegation. We had the financial ministry, because we had to open up, you\nknow, banking relationships, they could wire money between countries. We wanted to get health partnerships. Then we just had a lot of legal\nthings and national security things we wanted to\nstart putting together. So we do this flight and\nwe end up landing in UAE, and the picture of us coming\noff the plane being greeted by, Emiratis and Thobs with a LL plane, with an Israeli flag on it just captured everyone's imagination. And so it was one of these\nthings where it's like you work so hard on the details\nand the negotiation, I mean hundreds of hours\nto kind of make sure everything's perfect. And the one thing that\nyou do kind of, you know, \"Yeah, let's give it a shot.\" That image ended up\ncapturing everyone's heart. So going back to Sadat, that\nvisit was very critical. And what was interesting was,\nis according to this book, it happened because of a miscommunication. That was the first part,\nthe second part of the book, that's just amazing theater. And actually the book was based on a play. It was just going back=and-forth with all of the the different methodologies that they tried that failed, but they kept trying at it. And then ultimately seeing how\nthe personalities were able to find ways to make the\ncompromise that ultimately was a very, very big\nthing for more stability in the Middle East. And so, amazing book, I\nwould highly recommend it, a very entertaining read, and something that at\nleast gave me encouragement to keep going when the\ntask I was pursuing seemed so, so large. - I mean, if you could just linger on the personalities, you write in the book that words matter, or you write in the context\nof saying in the diplomacy business, words matter. And then you said that \"We're\nin the results business\" is a badass line. But if we just stick to\nthe diplomacy business, and words mattering, it seems like one of the\nthings you really highlight, that individual words can really have, like, you can fight over individual words. So, like, how do you operate in a world where like single words matter? - I think you have to be\nrespectful to the craft that you're in where words matter, but then realize that\nthey don't matter as much. And then also focus on\nthe fact that, you know, the actions are actually\nwhat's gonna matter more than the words. And so you have a difference between leaders and politicians. You know, politicians are there to say the right thing\nand to hold the power. Leaders are people who are\nwilling to do things that will be transformational, from my perspective. And so when I would think about diplomacy, words without actions, or\nwithout the threat of actions, and that was something that\nPresident Trump did very well, was that people knew that he\nwas willing to take action. He was very unpredictable\nand how he would act. And that made our words\nmuch more effective in what they did. So it's all a combination, but you know, coming from the private sector, we are all about results, right? If you're in government, you can work on something\nfor 10 years and fail, and then retire, and they\nconsider you an expert. In the private sector, if you work on something for 10 weeks, and you don't have a success,\nthen you're unemployed. You know? So it's a different kind of notion. And it was just\nunderstanding the mentality, and trying to adjust, and bridging the divides\nbetween the different trainings. - Is that the biggest thing\nyou took from your business background, is that just\nbe really results-focused? - It was just the only way to be. I mean, if I was giving up, you know, a nice life in New York, and if I was giving up the\nstuff that I really enjoyed, the company that I'd help build, and the life that I was enjoying in order to do government. I was going there to make a difference, and, you know, we had to focus on it. The other skillset, so there was a couple skill\nsets that I found were quite deficient in government. First of all, there was\na ton of amazing people. I mean, people talk about the bureaucracy. What I found was is you\nhad incredibly committed, passionate, intelligent, capable people all\nthroughout the government. And what they were waiting\nfor though was direction, and then cover in order to get there. And so there were a lot\nof tasks that I worked on, whether it was, building the\nwall at the southern border, where I was able to work\nwith Customs, Border Patrol, Army Corps of Engineers,\nmilitary, DHS professionals, DOD. And we basically all came together. And then once we had a good\nproject management plan, we were able to kind of\nmove very, very quickly. I think we built about 470\nmiles of border barrier in about two years, basically. And that worked very well, because we basically\nbrought private sector project management skillsets, which were quite often\nmissing in government. The second one is just, you know, we spoke about negotiation earlier. I would say that most\npeople in government, it's just a different form of\nnegotiation than you see in the private sector and way\nless effective in that regard, which is why I think it's\ngood the more we can encourage more people with private sector\nexperience to do a stint in government and to really try to contribute and serve their country. That's how our founders, I mean, George Washington and all\nthe, the founding fathers, they're working on their farms. They left their farms serving government, then they went back to the farm. And that was kind of the design of the representative government. It wasn't a career political\nclass, it was, you know, people coming in to, you know, show gratitude for the\nfreedoms and the liberties that they enjoyed and\nthen do their best to kind of help others have\nthose same opportunities that they had, and then they'd go back\nand live their lives. And so I think that there's\na lot of opportunity with our government of people with\nmore business mindsets who are gonna think about things\nfrom a solutions perspective, go and serve. - Is that one of the main problems here? So you also mentioned the book, \"The Great Degeneration\"\nby Niall Ferguson, an awesome historian,\nhe's been on this podcast, it helped you understand the\ninefficiencies of government regulation. I'd love it if you can give\nan insight into why government is so inefficient at times. Like, when it is inefficient,\nwhen it doesn't work, why is that the case? The bureaucracy that you spoke to, the negative aspects of the bureaucracy. - So we don't have enough\ntime on this podcast to go into it, but it's, look, there's a lot of aspects\nthat work as well, right? But I do think we've\ngotten too big, you know? Niall's book that you mentioned, you know, one of the things that I took from that, I read it I think in 2012, right kind of in the middle\nof the great financial crisis, was he was talking about how\ngovernment regulation often was put in place to deal\nwith old crises, right? So it was never gonna\nsolve future problems, it was more to kind of create, to solve for problems that\nhad happened in the past. And I remember thinking about that. One thing I was very proud of, of the work of the Trump\nadministration was that you had four years consecutively where there was a net decrease\nin the cost of regulations. So to give you a context, in\nthe last year of Obama in 2016, there was 6 million man hours\nspent by the private sector complying with new federal regulations. And that's not really what\nthe intent of our government was, right? If we have rules or regulations, those should be legislated by Congress. They shouldn't be put in by bureaucrats, who are basically saying, \"I wanna follow this objective.\" So using kind of the power of\nthe pen in order to do that. So the deregulatory effort\nwas actually very critical to Trump's economic success that happened at the beginning of the administration. And then what I saw with\nregulation was anytime either there was legislation or regulation coming, the people pushing for it were\nusually the people who would benefit from the regulatory captures. You had these, you look at\nthe great financial crisis, where you had this big banking reforms. Well, what happened during\nthe big banking reforms? Then you had a big reduction\nin the amount of banks that occurred, and the big\nbanks became even bigger. Whereas I don't think\nthat was the intention of the legislation, but the people who were\nwriting the legislation, and influencing it had a\nlot of the constituencies from those larger institutions. And then what happened\nas a result of that? A lot of these smaller institutions\ndidn't have the ability to be as competitive. They had more restrictions, more costs. They became less profitable. But these were the banks that\nwere serving small business, which is the biggest creator\nof jobs in our country. And then as a result, the bigger banks got more powerful, and what happened in\nthe country as a result of he regulations that they put in place? The wealth gap in the country\ngrew, it didn't shrink. And so I think you'll oftentimes, what they say these\nregulations are intended to be, the result often becomes the opposite. And so, you know what President Trump did in his administration was they did a massive deregulatory effort. And I think they pledged that\nfor every one regulation they put on, because you do need some\nregulation in an economy, and in a society, they would take off two. And in the first year they\neliminated eight regulations for everyone. And so that was just\nsomething I took from it, which was I thought, very interesting. And you had to really, I think you just have to\nthink through what are the consequences gonna be of\nthe different actions you take. And often, government gets\nit wrong by taking an action that feels right, but has big negative\nconsequences down the road. - Let's go to some difficult topics. You wrote in the book about\nyour experience with some very low points in government. You've been attacked quite a bit, one of the ones that stands\nout as the accusations of collusion with Russia. And you tell in the book in\ngeneral, this whole story, this whole journey on a personal level, on a sort of big political level. Can you tell me some\naspects of this story? - Sure. So to give the\nlisteners some context, and people remember this now, it's been kind of swept away\nbecause it turned out not to be true, was that after President\nTrump won the election in 2016, instead of the media\nsaying, \"Oh, we were wrong.\" 'Cause again, everyone\nthought he had zero chance of winning. They said, \"Okay, well we\ncouldn't have been wrong. It must have been the\nRussians who worked with him.\" And so at first, when\nthis started coming up, I thought this was ridiculous. I mean, I was very intimately involved with the operations of the campaign. I was running the finance of the campaign, I was running the digital\nmedia of the campaign. I was running the\nschedule for the campaign. And I knew that on most\ndays we had trouble, like, working, coordinating\nwith ourselves, let alone collaborating with another government, or colluding as they called it. And so we did a great job, I\nthink as an underdog campaign, very leanly staffed. And then they said that we\nwere working with the Russians. And so, at the time, I didn't take it too seriously\nbecause I knew there was no truth to it. But it was amazing to me to\nstart seeing all of these institutions, whether it was\nCNN, The Washington Post, New York Times, these\nwere news organizations that I grew up having\na lot of respect for, taking these accusations so seriously, and then working themselves\nup in order to just cover it for two years. And then as a result, you\nhad a special counsel, you had a house investigation,\na senate investigation. And I personally spent\nabout, I think over 20 hours just testifying before\nthese different committees. Again, spent millions of\ndollars outta my own pocket on my legal fees to make\nsure I was well represented. And the reason I did that was\nbecause I saw in Washington, it was like a sick game, right? It's almost like, even though there was no underlying problems to the accusation, I felt like this is one of\nthose things where they're gonna try to catch you, and then\nif you step on the line, they catch you with one misrepresentation, they're gonna try to put you\nin jail or worst of, you know? And so for me, that was a big concern. So, you know, it was amazing. I mean, my poor mom, I told\nher to stop reading whatever. I said, \"Ma, I promise you,\nwe didn't do anything wrong, it's good.\" But, you know, she'd\ncall me and say, \"Well, our friends were on the Upper East Side we're talking with Chuck Schumer, says, \"Jared's going to jail. You know, know for sure that\nhe colluded with the Russians.\" And this is like a leading\nsenator saying things like this. And so it was just interesting\nfor me to see how the whole world could believe something\nand be talking about it that I knew with 1000%\ncertainty was just not true. And so seeing that play\nout was very, very hard. Obviously, you know, I was\naccused of a lot of things. There were times in\nWashington, I was radioactive. I remember one weekend, you\nknow, it was all over CNN. The people, they had panels on CNN, like the news organization\nthat I grew up thinking was, like, the number one trusted name for news in the world, talking about how I'd committed\ntreason because I met with an ambassador and said, \"We'd like to hear your\nperspective on what you think the policy should be in Syria,\" where there was a big civil\nwar happening and ISIS, and a lot of different things. So it was quite a crazy\ntime in that regard. But luckily, again, we were\nable to fight through it. It was a major distraction\nfor our administration, and I think we were able\nto kind of stay focused on the objectives and the policies. But it was a crazy time. And I learned a lot from that experience. - It's crazy how just an accusation can be viral and can just go. One of the things that worries\nme is the effect on your mind, the psychology of it, to make sure it doesn't make you cynical, like people that are trying to do stuff, those kinds of stories that\ncan destroy their mind. So one of the things I'd\nlove to sort of understand, you kind of rolled in\nfrom the business world, and all of a sudden, the\nentire world from CNN to everybody's accusing you of\ncolluding with the Russians. Like, when you're sitting at home, how do you keep a calm mind, a clear mind, an optimistic one that\ndoesn't become cynical, and actually just keep trying to push on, and do stuff in the world? - Yeah. So it was a surreal experience. I would say number one,\nis I felt very confident that I hadn't done anything wrong. I'd always tell my lawyer like, \"The good news is I've got\na good fact problem,\" right? Like, I need a good lawyer\nto get me through it. But it's much easier to be a\ngood lawyer if you have a very innocent client. And so the fact that I\nknew that I didn't believe that I had any legal liability, helped me kind of intellectually\nseparate the challenge I needed to do to fight\nthrough it from it. And then I just basically\nsaid like, you know, I'd had hardship earlier in\nmy life where I dealt with the situation with my father. And what I realized there is\nthat you can't really spend energy on the things\nthat you don't control. All you can do is spend your\ntime and energy worrying about what you can control and then\nhow you react to the things that you have there, and so\nit took a lot of discipline, it took a lot of strength. And again, I give my wife\nIvanka and, and even Donald, a lot of credit for, you know, for kind of having my\nback during that time, and encouraging me just to\nkind of fight through it. And then I also had to make\nsure that I didn't allow that to distract me from my job. I felt like I had an amazing\nopportunity in the White House to make a difference in the world. And if I would've spent all\nmy time playing defense, you know, in politics,\nit's a time duration game. In business, you have whatever duration you set for yourself. In politics, it's time duration. We had four years. Every day was sand through an hourglass. My mindset was I need to\naccomplish as much as I can in these four years. And I guess the traditional\ngame that's played in Washington is whether it's the media, the opposition, their job is to distract you\nand then try to stop you from being as successful as you want to be. And so just fought through\nit and wasn't always fun, but we got through and, and thank God, it's something people don't talk about. And it has been amazing to me just the lack of\nself-awareness and reflection of a lot of the people who\nhyped this up for two years. They don't think there was\nanything wrong with it. And that's interesting. But, you know, my view is we\ngot through it, it's good. So it's in the past, and then I started moving to\nthe future and that's really where I spend my time.\n- Yeah, but I wanna linger on it because to me, that has\na really discouraging effect on anyone who's trying to\ndo positive in the world. Like, these kinds of attacks are intense. - Yeah.\n- I mean, you you say kind of one\nof the lessons you learned is that you really have to be perfect. But I hate that to be the lesson. I feel like you should be\nable to do stupid stuff, take big risks, and people\ncelebrate the big risks, and not try to weave gigantic\nstories over nothing. I just wanna kind of understand\nthe two aspects of this, how not to have such\nstores have so much legs, and the other is how to\nstay psychologically strong. So you kind of waved it off\nthat you didn't have a fact problem, but it can just\nhave a effect in your psyche. You seem to be pretty stoic\nabout the whole thing, but how, I mean, just\non the psychology side, how did you stay calm\nand not become cynical, where you can continue to\ndo stuff and take big risks? - I didn't have a choice.\n- What do you mean? - I mean, I could have spent every day feeling sorry for myself or complaining, or saying things aren't fair. But the general way I looked\nat it was that in life, every opportunity has a cost. And, you know, you could look at it and say,\nmaybe this was a massive cost, either in dollars, or in\ntime, or in reputation, or an emotional drain. But you could also say that, you know, I had an opportunity to\nwork in the White House, and I had an opportunity to work on some of the hardest challenges. And you talk about how\nthat's not celebrated, that is something very\ndifferent in the private sector. When you take on big\nchallenges, that is celebrated. In government, when you\ntake on big challenges, people wanna see it fail or\nthey want to criticize those people who are trying to take that on. And I think that's wrong. And I think that as a country,\nwe should be thinking big, we should be dreaming big, and we should be encouraging\nour politicians to try, and to fail more, and to go\nand to take on big things, knowing that there's risk of failing. Obviously, we want them\nto succeed, not to fail, but let's take on the big\nthings, let's try to do that. So I think it's just very\nbasic that, you know, you're in a situation,\nI've made decisions. I can't go back and change\ndecisions in the past. I still felt very blessed to\nbe in the position I was in. And I knew that I just\nhad to work through it. And like I said, I was very\nlucky to have, you know, support from my wife, and from my family, and from good friends. Again, I think I'd\nchosen very good friends in life, and my friends were with me. I had one friend who, you know, my lowest moment, you\nknow, got on the plane, he lived in Arizona, got on a plane, and came just have dinner with me to say, \"Just pick your head up. I know you're down now,\nyou're gonna be fine. Just fight through.\" That meant a lot to me. And again, I always think\nin my life, you know, you don't learn as much\nfrom your successes. You don't learn as much\nfrom your high points. You learn the most about who\nyou wanna be and how the world works from your lowest moments. And at those lowest\nmoments, it made me better. And it taught me how to be a better friend to people who are in tough situations. And I tried to just get tougher, and I tried to just get\nbetter, and work through it. - Yeah. You said that you and Ivanka, this intense time\nbrought you two together, and helped you kind of\ndeal with the intensity of the chaos of it all. - So I think it was just number one, knowing that you had a partner\nand knowing that you had somebody who loved you\nand believed in you. I think that was definitely by\nfar the biggest of anything. - Love is the answer.\n- Love is very important. But then there's also a lot\nthat I've learned from her. Always getting me to read different books, or learn different things, which I love. But she's also, I think,\nan amazing role model. And I go through our time in Washington, where there were so many people who were, I thought\nvery nasty to her unfoundedly. And I'm not talking about\nindividually. 'cause again, you know, most people interacted\nwith her, were super kind. But I would see people, you know, on Twitter or different\nplaces go after her. And she always stayed elegant. I felt like that was something\nthat she never stooped down to a lower level, she kept\nher elegance the whole time. And she really went to\nWashington wanting to be a force of good. And I see all the time\nthat she follows her heart. She does what's right and\nshe has a very strong moral compass. And, and I feel very lucky\nto have her as a partner. And I respect her tremendously. - Yeah, she walks through the\nfire with grace, I would say. And she's recommended a\nbunch of amazing books to me. And she has an in an\nincredible, a fascinating mind. But one thing that jumped out\nto me is you both love diners, Jersey Diners. So I lived in Philly for a while. And I traveled quite a bit. And traveling from Boston\ndown to Philly, maybe to DC. You can drive through Jersey. There's something about Jersey, I dunno what it is.\n- It's the best. - You listen to Bruce Springsteen. Lucy K has this bit where, I think it's part of\ncriticizing cell phones today, where people are too much on their phone. They don't just sit there, be bored, but he's uses that story to\ntell where he's just driving, and Bruce Springsteen's song comes on, and he just wants to pull\nover to the side of the road, and just like weep for\nno unexplainable reason. And I think that's true,\n'cause life is difficult. Life is full of suffering,\nor struggle, or challenges. Sometimes, it's always Bruce Springsteen, but some kind of song like\nthis can really make you reflect on life, that melancholy feeling. But that melancholy\nfeeling is the other side of the happiness coin, where if you just allow\nyourself to feel that pain, you can also feel the highest joys. That's the sort of the\npoint Lucy came makes. And there's something about\nJersey with the diners, often late at night. There's several diner\nexperiences, I should say. Okay. There's like the family friendly, there's a nice waitress,\nand there's a sweetness, a kindness, like, \"Hello,\nsweetheart,\" that kind of thing. There's also like the 3:00 AM diner, the ones that are open 24 hours, that has a romantic element\nwhen you're a young man or young woman, you're traveling,\nthe loneliness of that. It's all of it. The American diner is like\nfrom like Jack Kerouac on, represents something, I'm\nnot sure what that is, but it's like a real beautiful experience. And the food itself too.\n- Always fresh, yeah. The thing with diners, there's so much to love about it. When I grew up, obviously, in New Jersey, when I'd go with my father to\nbusiness, he'd always stop. We'd eat at a diner. Late night, I'd be come\nback with my friends, we'd stop at a diner. And it's a tradition that Ivanka and I had loved doing as well. And I think there's a notion of, it's very egalitarian in that, you know, people from all places are there. You could order basically\nwhatever you want. I mean, the, the menus at the diners look like the phone book.\n- That's great. - And it's amazing how they keep so much fresh ingredients to do it. At least the good ones do. I'd love as a jersey guy,\nyou get mozzarella stick, and an omelet, at any hour of the day, 'cause most of 'em are open 24 hours. And that's basically\nmy Ivanka and my go-to, we'll throw in a milkshake or two as well. Nice.\n- But for me as a kid, you know, my father would take me, sometimes I'd sit with him in the meeting, sometimes I'd be at the table next to him. He'd give me a bunch of quarters to put in the music machine that\nthey would have on the wall. And it was always just a great experience doing it in Jersey. And I joke that, you know,\nif you grow up in Jersey, you grow up with just enough\nof a chip on your shoulder that you have to go and make\nsomething of yourself in life. It's a special place. I had an amazing childhood there, and very, very proud to be from the state. And I will just give a\nlittle bit of a plug now, because the state has now\nactually turned the corner, and they had a $10 billion\nbudget surplus for many years. You know, it was a state\nthat was basically bankrupt, and now actually under a\npretty progressive Democrat, governor Phil Murphy, he's turned the state around\nand it's actually has a very bright future ahead. And it's probably one of the best places to raise a family in the country, right? It's got very low crime, one of the best public school\nsystems in the country. Pretty good healthcare\nsystem, a lot of green parks. People know the turnpike,\nbut it's got a lot to it. That's really great. So I'm a big, big fan of Jersey. - I like how this is a first\nfor this particular podcast, you literally gave a plug to a state. So New Jersey, everybody. - [Jared] It's where it's at. - There's South Jersey,\nthere's North Jersey. I mean there all, there's\nall kinds of jerseys too. I mean, the whole thing, it just, I- - [Jared] And don't get me started on the \"Jersey Shore,\" Lex. - \"Jersey Shore\" is a whole thing- - And I'm not talking\nabout the Snooki part, I'm talking about the real nice parts, where there's great food, great people. - What do you mean, nice parts? It's all beautiful. The full range of human\ncharacters that are in New Jersey are all beautiful.\n- I agree with that. - And every time I\ntravel across the world, there's always to meet\nsome from New Jersey, and you kind of give a\nnod of deep understanding. It's the cradle of civilization many ways. So, back, I don't know how we got there. Oh, all right. Going back to the low points. You mentioned your father, if\nwe could just return there. Even just the personal\nstory of your father, that you write about that, of the betrayal that happened\nin his life and then how he responded to that betrayal and\nhe was after that arrested. Can you just tell the story? - Sure. So my father is an amazing person, and we grew up in New Jersey. My father was a big developer, a great entrepreneur,\nbuilt an amazing business. He got into a dispute\nwith two of his siblings. And through that dispute, they basically took all of\nthe documents in his company, went to the US attorney's office, and turned into, from a civil dispute into a real public dispute. My father did something\nwrong in that process. And when he got arrested for that, he basically said, \"You know what? What I did was wrong.\" And he, he took his medicine\nand he did it like a man. And he said, \"I'm gonna go to prison.\" And he did that for a year. And so for me that was\na very challenging time in the family, obviously. You know, it was a shock. It was a total change. I grew up, my childhood was I think a very nice childhood. You know, my parents always\nsaid, \"Do good in school. Work hard.\" I was very, very focused on my athletics. I was captain of the basketball team, captain of the hockey team. I ran a marathon with my father, and it was always about pursuing. Went to Harvard, graduated with honors, and I was in NYU pursuing a law degree, and a business degree. And I was working at the\nManhattan District Attorney's office at the time, actually thinking I wanted\nto go into public service. 'cause my father always taught us, we were always surrounded by politicians. And he always said, you know,\n\"My parents came to America. They lived in the land of\nopportunity and they had these opportunities because\nthis is the best country in the world. And so you should be\nsuccessful, work hard, don't ever let your opportunities\nbecome your disadvantages, because you have advantages in life. You have to work harder.\" And that's what he instilled\nin myself and my brother. And he always pushed us to\nmake the most of ourselves. And when we did that, you know, everything changed overnight\nwhen my father got arrested. Obviously, it's very\nembarrassing for a family when you're on the front\npage of the papers. I would see the newspapers\nwriting all these things about my father that I didn't think were\nrepresentative of the person that I knew. It was a big change for our family. And, you know, I was angry. I was angry. I said, you\nknow, I could be angry at the prosecutor. I could be angry at my father's brother. I could be angry at my father's lawyers. I could be angry at my father\nfor making this mistake. And then I kind of said, that's\nnot gonna change anything. And I had a real shift. I do think that that was a\nturning point in my life, where I basically said, let me focus on the things I can control, Let me focus on the\npositive things I can do, and from that moment forward, I said, \"How can I be a great son to my father? How could I be a great older\nbrother slash substitute father for my two sisters and my younger brother? How could I be there for my mother? How could I be there for\nmy father's business?\" And I just went into battle mode. And I put my armor on and I\njust, you know, ran into it. And for the next two years,\nit was, every day was painful. I mean, I was dealing with banks. The company still had subpoenas.\nI was still in law school. I did tell my father I wanted\nto drop out of law school and business school, but\nhe said, \"Please don't.\" So I would basically go to\nlaw school one day a week or maybe I'd skip it most days. And I'd go to his office every day. And my friends would joke\nthat if my professors wanted to fail me, the law professor\nwould have to gimme a test that had four pictures and say, \"Circle who your professor is,\" you know? But I would basically take a week off, I'd read the books, and I did\nwell, and I got my degrees. And it was just a very,\nvery challenging time. But like I said to you before\nis that you learn the most about life and you learn\nthe most about humanity, and yourself when you're in\nyour most challenging periods. And I'll say that, you know,\nthat experience also changed the people I interacted with, spending weekends with my\nfather down in a prison in Alabama, I met the other inmates, I met their families. I spent time then trying to\nadvise the children of other people who were going\nthrough the same experience that I'd gone through on how\nto navigate it correctly. And you just learn a lot about the world. And you see that in life, everything could get taken from you, your status, your money, your friends. I saw that certain people were\nvery disloyal to my father at the time, who he thought were friends. It was only a handful. But again, I learned from those people, how can I be a true friend to people? How can I be better? And I learned a tremendous\namount through that experience. - You're right, that your father told\nyou about being humble. I'd love to ask you about this, that in life sometimes you get so powerful that we start to think we're\nthe dealers of our own fate. We're not the dealers, God is the dealer. Sometimes we have to be brought\nback down to earth to get perspective on what is really important. What do you think he meant by that? What did you learn from that experience? - The way I interpreted at\nthe time, and those were very, very memorable words. After I picked up my father\nfrom the arraignment, I drove him down, I drove the car. And my father and I are very, very close. And he didn't say a\nword for the whole time. I think he was processing, number one, what was happening to him,\nand I couldn't even imagine. But I actually think\nthe bigger pain for him, because my father is such a\ncommitted person to the family, is like, \"Did I let my family down? Did I let my kids down?\" And I do think he felt that that moment, like his life was over. He couldn't really see past\nwhat this challenge was gonna bring and if there would\nbe a life for him after it. So I could see that he had a lot of fear, and he really wasn't saying much. And then I didn't know what to do. And so I just stood by\nhim and stood close. And, you know, later that\nday, or the next day, he got up and started walking. He had an ankle monitor\nfor whatever reason, the prosecutor was such a, so aggressive, he was a flight risk. So they made him wear an ankle monitor. They were very, very aggressive and nasty. And at the time, my father\nwas the biggest donor to Democrats. The prosecutor was a Republican. It was a very political thing. And what happened was, is he was walking around the\npool and I just started walking with him and he said to\nme, \"You know, Jared, in life, sometimes we get\nso powerful that we believe that we're the dealer.\" He says, \"But we're not the dealer. God's the dealer. And we have to come down\nto earth to understand,\" like you said. So what what I took from\nthat was that my father, with all of his success,\nhad started to believe that maybe certain rules\ndidn't apply to him. And I think that that's\nwhere he made a mistake. And I think he had a lot of\nregret that he made the mistake. And you know, my father\nis a very humble person. He's a very moral person. You know, for me, with my humility, my brother and I joke that\nwe give our credit for being humble, number one, to being Mets fans. Because every year you\nhave a lot of promise, and then it never ends up paying off. Although now with Steve Cohen, hopefully we're on a different trajectory. But the other thing is\nalso our mother, you know, our mother really raised\nus to be very humble. We knew we had a lot, but every Sunday morning\nmy mom was there clipping the coupons. The cereal we ate in\nour house was based on, it was based on what was on\nsale versus what we liked. You know, when we would have a problem with our teachers in school and I'd say, \"Well, teacher doesn't like me. She'd say, \"Well, I'm not calling them. It's your job to make\nthe teacher like you.\" And so my mother gave us a lot of that. My father gave us a lot of the grounding. And I think during that time, my father was just realizing\nthat maybe he had gotten disconnected from the\ngrounding and the values. And again, I think he also accepted maybe he could have blamed others for acting inappropriately. But I respect the fact that\nhe took responsibility himself and said, \"I can't control\nthe actions of other people. I can't control what they\ndo is right and wrong. I can just control my actions.\" And as I go on the next\njourneys in my life, and I go to government,\nI go to Washington. I mean, I even think through the craziness of going from visiting\nmy father in a prison, to 10 years later sitting in\nthe office in the White House next to the President\nof the United States. And like, I think about\nthat story and that it's a story that only God could write. And I really believe you\nhave to have a lot of faith, because the lows and the\nhighs are both so extreme and unbelievable that I\nfeel like those low moments in some ways allowed me\nto keep my grounding, and to understand what was\ntruly important in life for when I ended up going\nthrough those other moments. - Your father was betrayed,\nperhaps over money by siblings. Is there some deeper wisdom\nyou can draw from that? Have you seen money or perhaps power cloud people's judgment? - Oh, 100%. 100%. - Is there some kind of\noptimistic thing you can take from that about human nature of\nhow to escape that clouding of judgment when you're\ntalking about leaders, when you're talking about\ngovernment, even business, because you mentioned there's\na power dynamics at play always when you're negotiating. Is there a way to see the common humanity, and not see the sort of will\nto power in the whole thing? - Definitely. You know, you mentioned about\npower, money corrupting. There's a great quote I\nheard a friend of mine say, he's a guy, Michael Harris, who was one of the founders\nof Death Row Records. He was being interviewed\nrecently and they asked him about what happened with Suge Knight. And his line was, \"Money\njust makes you more of what you already are,\" which I thought was a very\nelegant way of saying it. And I would see this time and\ntime again in the White House, where you had people who\nwere now given a lot of responsibility and power\nand it went to their head, and they acted very crazily, and maybe didn't act in a way that I thought was always\nconducive to the objectives. So I think it's a very\nbig problem that you have, whether it's something that's solvable. I think it's about\nhaving the right leaders, and hopefully for the\nleaders, having good friends. I mean, I'm still friends with a lot of the people I interacted with when I was in government and you know, the number one thing I try to be to them is just a good friend. I try to be somebody who they\ncan talk about things with. I don't go in trying to tell\nthem what to do on different things and I think that\nthat's a big thing, is that people just need friends, and they need conversation,\nand if they have that, then hopefully that allows\nthem to keep their head in the right place. - I think this is a good place to ask about one aspect of the\nfascinating work you've done, which is on prison reform. Can you take me through\nyour journey of helping the Bipartisan Bill get passed, just working on prison reform\nin the White House in general, how you made that happen, how\nyou help make that happen? - Sure. So we passed a law called\nthe First Step Act, which was the largest prison\nand criminal justice reform bill that's been done maybe\nin 30, 40, 50 years in the US. And so what it basically\ndid was two things. Number one, is it took the\nprison system and it took a certain class of offenders\nand allowed them to become eligible for earlier release\nif they go through the certain trainings that will allow them\nto have a lower probability of going back. So, you know, stepping back, you look at the prison system,\nyou say, \"What's the purpose? Is it to punish? Is it to warehouse? Is it to rehabilitate?\" And I do think that, we're\na country that believes in second chances. I saw firsthand when my father\nwas a client of the system, how inefficient it was and\nhow much better it could be. And you know, when my father got out, we didn't run from that experience. He started hiring people\nfrom Rikers Island, and different prisons into the company, into a second chance program, which we're very, very proud of doing. And what we saw through our\nmicro experience was that if you give people mentorship, if\nyou give 'em job training. A lot of people leave,\nthey have addiction issues, and they can't find housing. And so people leave prison\nwith a criminal record, and they're less likely to go back. and reintegrate in society without help from different institutions\nthat can help them do that. So we modeled the reforms\nof what they did in Texas, and Georgia, and other states where they basically put\na lot of job training, alcohol and addiction treatment\nprograms in the prisons as a way to incentivize the prisoners to work on themselves while they're there in order to allow them to reenter society. It's turned out to be\nvery successful so far. They just had a report that\nshowed that the general population has had a 47% recidivism rate, meaning that people who\nleave federal prison, half of 'em go back. And people who have\nnow taken this program, only 12% of them go back. So number one, you're\nmaking communities safer, because if people are gonna now get a job, and enter society instead\nof committing future crimes, you're avoiding future crimes. And number two, you're giving people a second chance at life. And so that was the first part of it. The second thing we did was, there was a rule passed\nin the '90s that basically penalized crack cocaine at 100 times the penalty of what regular cocaine was. And I think a lot of the motivations, what people say in retrospect\nwas that crack was more of a black drug drug and cocaine\nwas more of a white drug. And so there was a really racial\ndisparity in terms of what the application of these sentences were. So they then revised that\nto make it 18 to one. And what we did in this\nbill is we allowed it to go retroactive to allow people\nwho were in prison with sentences under the, what we\nthought was the racist law to be able to make an application to a judge in order to be dismissed. And it was based on\ngood behavior, you know, being rehabilitated and the\nfact that they would have a low probability of offending in the future. And so that was really the meat of it. And there was a couple other\nthings in there we did as well, which were also quite good. So we did it. Worked very closely with the Democrats, Republicans to do it. At first, President Trump was\na little bit skeptical of it, because he's a big strong\nlaw and order supporter, but he made me work very hard\nto put together a coalition of Republicans and Democrats,\nand law enforcement. We had the support from the the policemen. We had the support from\nthe ACLU, and ultimately, we were able to get it together, and it was an amazing thing. We ended up getting 87\nvotes in the Senate. You know, this happened for me at a time, it was while the Russia\ninvestigation stuff was still happening, new chief of\nstaff came in, John Kelly, he basically marginalized\nme in the operations. So I had kind of less\nday-to-day responsibilities in the White House. And so for me, this effort became one of my full-time efforts along with negotiating the Mexico trade deal, and along with the Middle East efforts. And the reason why that was\ngreat was because it didn't have a lot of support from the\nRepublican caucus originally, and people thought there\nwas no way it would happen. So I really was able to\nbe the chief executive, the middle executive, the\nlow executive, the intern. And through that process, I really got an education\non how congress works, on how to pass legislation.\nI was negotiating text, I was negotiating back and forth, and I built a lot of trust. Again, I would deal with,\nwhether it's Hakeem Jeffries, or Cedric Richmond, that\nwe built a lot of trust. We'd speak three times a day. These guys had my back, the, the ACLU. Again, I never thought they were suing our administration every day, or every other day on something. But for whatever reason, we built trust, and we were able to work together, and then also with the\nreal conservative groups, because there was a lot, a big\npart of the conservative base that felt like we should be\ngiving people a second chance. And in addition to that,\nthis will keep our country safer, and it'll reduce the cost of what we spend on prisons. And so it was a great\neffort and I was very, very proud that we're able to get it done under President Trump. - How'd you con convince the Republicans, so they were skeptical at first? Are we talking about like\njust phone conversations, going out to lunch? Just back to the emojis or what? - Hand-to-hand combat, meetings. The cool thing about this,\nso everyone always says, I always get frustrated when\nI hear a lawmaker say, \"Oh, the Senate's not what it used to be,\" or, \"Congress isn't what it used to be. Things are broken today.\" I don't think that's true. I think, you know, going\nthrough the process, I think that our founders were totally genius in the way\nthat they designed our system of government. And what I saw is you just have\nto work it so everyone knows the power of their vote. Some would give it to me easily, some wouldn't give it to me easily. Some would trade it for other things, some would withhold it\nbecause they were pissed about other things, and it was just hand-to-hand combat. So it was just making\ncalls, using the phone, walk in the halls, going\nto lunches, you know, hosting dinners at my house. It was a nonstop lobbying effort. And by the way, it was\nalso adjudicating issues and making people feel\nlike they were heard, hearing their issues, and then trying to find\nsolutions that you don't put something in that then tips\noff where you lose, you know, a whole coalition. So it was really a balancing act. But it's an amazing thing, and worked very closely\non that with Van Jones and Jessica Jackson, who also gave me a lot\nof help on the left. And it was an amazing\nthing, had a great team too. - You mentioned the importance of trust at the very beginning of the conversation. From the outsider perspective,\njust maybe a dark question, which is like how much trust\nis there in Washington, to the flip side of that, how much backstabbing is there? Can you form like long-term\nrelationships with people on a basic human level where\nyou know you're not going to be betrayed, screwed over,\nmanipulated for, again, going back to the old money and power? - The answer is yes, and the answer is no. So I made some incredible friends, lifelong friends through\nmy time in Washington. But the way I think\nabout it from politics, and I think in geopolitics as well is I would say that\npoliticians really don't have friends, politicians have interests. And as long as you kind\nof follow that rule, you should be able to know\nhow to rate where your relationship with a given\nperson falls in the spectrum. But I do think I was the exception. I did make some tremendous\nfriends, and again, I'd go back to what I said\nabout negotiation where, you know, when you're in a situation where there's really nothing in it for any of you personally, but you're in a foxhole together\nand nobody in Washington can get anything done by themselves. So you have people coming from\nall different backgrounds, all different experiences, all different geographies coming together, agreeing on an objective, creating a plan, and then every day rowing\ntogether in order to get it done. It's a beautiful thing\nand you really learn what people are about. And so when you go through\nan experience like that, you learn who's in it for themselves. You learn who's in it for\nthe cause and you know, for every, thing you read\nabout in the press of a fight I had with somebody\nbecause we were at odds, you know, I have about 100 people who have become lifelong friends, because I respect the way\nthat when we were under fire together, they got better, they were competent and\nthey were there to serve for the right reason. And so, I guess the answer is yes. It is possible. You have to be careful because\nthere are a lot of mercurial people there. I always say the politicians\nare like gladiators. I didn't have as much respect\nfor politicians till I got there, but if you think about it, everyone who's got a congressional\nseat or a Senate seat, there's 25 people back at\nhome who want their job, who think they're smarter\nthan them who are trying to back stab them. And so I always say that\nthe political dynamic, it's like in the private\nsector you're standing on flat ground, you choose\nwhich fights you take on, when you take them on, how you fight them. In politics, it's like\nyou're standing on a ball and what you have to realize\nis that there's maybe, like, 10 things that you have to do, but there's a potential\ncost to taking on each one that might destabilize you. You fall off the ball and\nthen you lose your opportunity to pursue those. You have to always be kind of\nmarking everything to market and going through your\ncalculations to make sure you can accomplish what you want to\nwithout falling off the ball, and losing your opportunity\nto make a difference. - I guess people like power, and I just feel like to\nbe a good politician, you should be willing, like\ngood meaning good for humanity, be willing to let go of power, you know, try to do the right thing. If there's somebody back home\nthat does manipulative stuff, screws you over and takes\npower from you, it's okay. I feel like that kinda humility is required to be a great leader. And I feel like that's actually\na good way to have long-term power because karma has\na viral aspect to it, just doing good by others, I feel like. - I'd like to say that's true, Lex. I think it's just way more complicated. I mean, you look what happened this week with Kevin McCarthy, right? He did what he thought was morally right. He thought he did a bipartisan deal. He was told that, you know, they would have his\nback, and then the moment things got tough, they,\nthey cut him loose. So again, I don't know if\nthat was the right thing or the wrong thing, right? I've also seen leaders\non the other end say, \"I'm gonna do things that\nare short term more selfish,\" but the way they justify\nto themselves is to say, \"I believe that myself staying in power is existential to the greater good. So I will do things that maybe\nare not in the greater good now because I believe that\nmy maintaining power is,\" and so it's complicated. In an idealized world, I'd love to believe that's the case, but it's just way more\ncomplicated than that. - Yeah. Yeah.\n- I wish it wasn't, but it is. - Yeah. I do just wish people zoomed out, and people in politics zoomed out a bit, and just asked themselves, \"What are we all doing this for?\" Like, sometimes, you can\nget like a little bit lost in the game of it. If you zoom out, you realize\nlike integrity is way more important than like\nlittle gains in money or little gains in power in the long term. So when you look at yourself in the mirror at the end of the day, and\nalso how history remembers you. I just feel like people do some dark stuff when they're like in that moment when they're losing power\nand they try to hold on a little too hard. This is when they can\ndo really dark things, like bring out the worst in themselves. And it is just sad to see,\nand I wish there was a kind of machinery of government\nwould inspire people to be their best selves in their last days versus their worst selves, right? - When that system gets\ninvented, you'll share with me what it is. But, look, let me give you\nanother way to frame it, which is, and this was\nkind of the revelation we spoke before about, you know, kind of when I\nwas getting my butt kicked by the Russian investigation\nand all the different areas, but kind of the basic framework\nI looked at was I said, \"Okay, you know, this all feels tough.\" But I said, \"The game's, the game. The game's been here way longer, way before I came, and it'll\nbe here way long after I leave. And so I have two choices. I can complain that the\ngame's tough, it's not fair, it's not moral. Or I can go and I can try to play the game as hard as possible.\" And I think that there's\ntwo different things, right? You have people who are willing\nto kind of sit in the stands and they're willing to\nyell at the players, or make their points known. Or you have people who\nare willing to suit up, and get in the arena, and go play. And I have a lot of respect for the people who suit up and go play. And, again, some of 'em, you know, I wish they would\nplay for different means, but the fact that they're\nwilling to put their name on the ballot, make the sacrifice and go put on the pads, and get hit, and hit others, I think that you need those people. And I wish more people who had\nmaybe the moral wiring that you discussed would be putting\non a helmet and going to play, 'cause it's hard, it's hard. - I agree with you. I just would love to fix the aspect of the Russia collusion,\naccusation, the virality, the power of that, because that's a really\ndiscouraging thing for people. Maybe it's the way it has to be, but it's seems like a disincentive\nto people to participate. - It it is, but I'll give you again, a an optimistic side of\nit is that, you know, what you're seeing now with\nsocial media is I do think, with what's happening\nat X there is now more of a reversion towards\nmore egalitarian, right? And egalitarianism of information. And so for many years the media\npublications were the gate holders, they were the gatekeepers. And then you had these social\nmedia companies that grew, they became so powerful, but then they were tilting the scales. Why they were doing it, you know, we can go through\nlong explanations for that, but if there truly is a real\nforum and a democratization of information, then you would think that the\nmarketplace of ideas would surface the real ones and\ndiscredit the non-real ones. And I think that as a society\nwe're starting to kind of come to grips with the fact that\nthe power dynamic is changing, and that some of these\ninstitutions that we used to have a lot of faith in don't deserve our faith. And some of them, you know, will actually reform and\nmaybe re-earn our faith. So I think that there could\nbe an optimistic tone. Again, the years of Trump, I think that, you know, he was an outsider and you know, he represented something\nthat was existential to the system, right? You think about for the 30 years before, you were either part\nof the Clinton dynasty, or the Bush dynasty, I think a lot of people in the\ncountry felt like that whole class, whether you wearing\na red shirt or a blue shirt, wasn't representing them. And Trump represented a true\noutsider to that system. And I do think that as he went in there, there was a lot of norms that\nwere broken to try to stop him from changing the\ntraditional power structure. So I think that we're at a time\nwhere maybe there will be an optimistic breakthrough where\nyou'll have institutions that will allow for a lot more\ntransparency into what truth really is. - I'd love to go back and talk\nto you about the Middle East 'cause there's so many\ninteresting components to this. Let's talk about Saudi Arabia. And first let me ask you about\nMBS, Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince. So you've gotten to know him pretty well, you've become friends with him. What's he like as a human being, just on a basic human\nlevel, what's he like? - So for the listeners, Mohammed bin Salman is now the\nCrown Prince of Saudi Arabia. He has risen to that position\nover the last couple of years and he's been a tremendous\nreformer for the country. He's gone in and he's really\nmodernized the economy. He's put a lot more\ninvestment into the country. He's marginalized the religious\npolice and he's really done a good job to bring\nmodernization, a lot of reform. So he's been a great reformer. What he's like as a person\nis, he's very high energy. He's got tremendous candle\npower, very, very smart, incredibly well read. When he was younger, his father\nwould give him a book a week and make him report on it on the weekend. He was trained as a leader\nand as a politician, really by his father,\nhe's not western educated. So he grew up in the Saudi\nculture and he's a real Saudi nationalist. He loves their history,\nloves their heritage, has a steep understanding of the tribal nature of the region. And you know, his father was actually known\nto be a tremendous politician. So when he was governor of Riyadh, people who I speak to today\nabout him say that if they had a full election, he\nwould've won in a landslide. They say every time somebody\nwent to the hospital, he was the first person to call. Anytime there was a funeral, he was the first person to show up. He's a very, very beloved leader. Muhammed, bin Salman, he was a businessman before he got into Crown Prince. So he thinks really with\na business mindset about how he runs the country. And he's brought I think a\ndifferent mindset and energy to the Middle East. You know, one thing I'll say\nthat maybe that comes to mind here is that I remember\nearly on talking with him about all the different\ninitiatives he was taking on. He's building a big city\ncalled Neo in the desert, in a place where there really\nwas nothing on the Red Sea. And a lot of people were\ncriticizing the ambition of the plan. And I was sitting with\nhim one night and I said, \"Why are you taking on all these things? You know, you've got a\nlot of different programs, but you know what most\npoliticians do is they set lower expectations and then they\nexceed the expectations.\" And he looked at me without hesitation. He says, \"Jared, you know, the way I look at it is\nthat in five years from now, if I set five goals and\nI achieve five goals, I'll achieved five things. If I set 100 goals and\nI fail at 50 of 'em, th in IN five years, I'll\naccomplish 50 things. And so it's a very different\nmindset as a leader. The way I got to work\nwith him was Saudi Arabia was a big topic in the campaign. President Trump was basically\nsaying during the campaign they've gotta pay for their fair share. They haven't been a great\npartner in the region. He's very critical of Saudi. And then during the transition, I was asked by several friends\nto meet with a representative of Saudi Arabia. I said, \"I don't wanna meet with them.\" But I came over and I\nmet and they said, \"Well, we wanna make changes.\" And I said, \"Well, you\nhave to make changes, to how you treat women.\" Then, women couldn't drive,\nthey had guardianship laws. I said, \"You gotta start\nworking with Israel. You have to be paying\nmore of your fair share, and you have stopping the Wahhabism that that's being spread. And again, I'd no knowledge, these were just kind of the\ntraditional talking points about Saudi Arabia. So the guy I was with basically\nsaid is a guy fa Alto, he's a very respected minister there. \"Jared,\" he says, \"You don't know much about\nSaudi Arabia, do you?\" I said, \"No, no, I don't.\" It's just really what I\nreally I've kind of been told or what I read. And he says, \"Okay, lemme do this. We wanna be great allies with America. We've traditionally been\ngreat allies with America. Can I come back to you with a\nproposal on ways that we can make progress on all of the\ndifferent areas where we have joint interests?\" And keep in mind at that point in time, the Middle East was a mess. And probably the single\nbiggest issue we had after ISIS was the ideological battle. If you remember in 2016, there was the Pulse nightclub\nshooting in Orlando, you had the San Bernardino\nshooting and people were being radicalized online with the extremism. And then there was a\nlot of crimes that were happening because of that. And it was a big topic in the campaign. And so that when I was\nthinking about, you know, talking to different generals\nand what capabilities the US had to really combat the\nextremism and the ideological battle, what we realized\nwas that Saudi Arabia IS the custodian of the\ntwo holiest sites in Islam, the Mecca Medina, that that would be the best\npartner to work with if they were willing to. But, for years, they\nreally hadn't been willing to kind of lean into this fight. So I said, sure, give a proposal. So they come back, give a\nproposal, and they said, \"Look, if you make President Trump's\nfirst trip to Saudi Arabia, we will do all these different things. We'll increase our military\nspending and cooperation, we'll counter all the terror financing.\" Unbelievable layer. So I took the proposal,\nI went to the national, then, it was General Flynn. I said, \"If Saudi Arabia did these things, would this be considered a big deal?\" \"Unbelievable, but it'll never happen.\" I said, \"Well, they're\ntelling me they wanna do these things.\" Again, I having no\nforeign policy experience, I'm just saying I've got\nsomebody telling me they want do it, and that's kind of where we started. We get into office, I don't\nthink much more about it. And then I think it was like\na maybe a month in President Trump has a call with King Salman, and before the call,\nwe're in the Oval Office, and the president's basically saying, well, you know, this is\nwhat we want to go through. And I have Secretary Mattis\nand Secretary Tillerson, the Minister of Defense\nand the Secretary of State basically saying, you have to deal with MBN. MBN is is the guy who's been our partner for all these years. He's the head of intelligence\nand he's been a great partner. I said, \"Well, if he's\nbeen a great partner, then why do we have all\nthese problems that you guys are complaining about with Saudi?\" I said, \"I've been told\nthat we have this proposal from MBS who's the Deputy Crown Prince, and that's who we should\nbe dealing with on this. And so the phone call starts\nand President Trump listened to both of us. And on the phone call with King Salman, President Trump says, \"Okay, we'll go through all these things. These are the things we want to get done.\" And he says, \"Well, who\nshould we deal with? And King Salman says, \"Deal with my son, the\nDeputy Crown Prince, MBS.\" And so President Trump said on the phone, \"Have him deal with Jared,\" because I think he knew\nthat if he would've put him with the other guys, they\nwere not believers in what he had the ability to do. And that's how I got\nassigned to work with him. I get back to my office after\nthat, have an email from him, spoke to him for the first time, and then we just went to work. And, you know, a lot of\npeople were betting against that trip. They thought it wasn't\ngonna be successful. And they've been betting\nagainst him and he's been underestimated, but he's\nbeen doing an incredible job. And the whole Middle\nEast is different today, because of the work that he's done. - Maybe it's instructive to\ngo through the mental journey that you went on from\nlike the talking points, the basic narratives, the\nvery basic talking points, understanding of Saudi\nArabia to making that human connection with MBS, and\nmaking the policy connection that it's actually\npossible to solve problems. What was that journey like? Why was it so difficult to take\nfor others, and why were you effective in being able to\ntake that journey yourself? - Maybe some of it came\nfrom my inexperience, but my desire to listen and hear people. So, you know, I had this proposal, I was told that all of\nthese things were good, then we're trying to schedule\nthis trip and the National Security Council calls\na meeting where we're in the situation room\nand we have, you know, Homeland Security, Secretary\nof Defense, Secretary of State, and everyone's saying \"This\nis gonna be a disaster.\" They said, \"If we go to Saudi Arabia, the Saudis never keep their promises.\" And our Secretary of State at\nthe time was a gentleman named Rex Tillerson, who'd been CEO of Exxon. So he dealt with all these\nplay people very extensively. And he basically said, \"In my experience, the Saudis won't come through, and Jared, you don't know what you're\ndoing, you're wasting your time.\" And I basically was at a point\nwhere I said, \"Look, guys, but they're saying they\nwant to do all these things, shouldn't we at least give\nhim a chance to try to do it?\" Why do we want to\npredetermine their direction by not giving them a chance to change? Just because things in the\npast haven't gotten the way you want them to, that doesn't mean they can't\ngo that way in the future. So we fought the battle, you know, they basically deferred and,\nand let me go through with it, but when I do the planning\nmeetings for the trip, nobody would show up because\nthey all thought it was gonna be an absolute disaster. And by the way, they probably\nweren't wrong to think that, 'cause I'd never planned\na foreign trip before, and I'd never done any\nforeign policy before. So during the planning, I'd speak to MBS, almost every day, and I'd go through all\nthe different details, and the things that would be\ncoming up and I said, \"Look, I really need to get\nthese things in writing.\" He sent over a guy, Dr. Musaad Al Aiban, who's a tremendous diplomat for them. And he came to Washington,\nstayed for three weeks, and we worked through\nall the different details of what we needed and we ended up coming to an arrangement on what it should be. So, you know, I think about now in retrospect\nwhy I was so focused on getting things like this done, and why I even believed\nthat they could be possible. But the answer is, it's really the people I was\ntalking to on the other end were telling me that these\nthings were possible. And so just because they hadn't\nbeen done before and just because others around me didn't\nbelieve that they could be done, I wasn't willing to just\nsay, \"Well, let's not try.\" - It just seems like that cynicism that takes over is paralyzing. And now you send me a great\nessay from, from Paul Graham, I'm a big fan of, that I think explains\na lot of your success. The essay is called\n\"How to Do Great Work,\" and people should go\ndefinitely read the full essay. There's a few things I could read from it. Some quotes, \"Having new ideas is a strange\ngame because it usually consists of seeing things that\nwere right under your nose. Once you've seen a new idea,\nit tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this before? Seeing something obvious sounds easy, and yet empirically\nhaving new ideas is hard.\" The steps you took seem trivial, and yet nobody was taking\nthem, or at least in the past, they weren't successful. So the successes you've had\nwere as simple as essentially picking up the phone or trying. - [Jared] Mm-hm. - There's a lot of interesting\nthings here to talk about. This aspect of doing the\nseemingly simple that seems to be so hard to do, it, as Paul describes, \"Requires a willingness to break rules. There are two ways to be\ncomfortable breaking rules, to enjoy breaking them and\nto be indifferent to them.\" That's an interesting distinction. \"I call these two cases being\naggressively and passively independent minded.\" So again, that's to enjoy breaking the rules, or to be indifferent to the rules. \"The aggressively independent-minded\nare the naughty ones. Rules don't merely fail to stop them. Breaking rules gives\nthem additional energy. For this sort of person delight\nat the sheer of audacity of a project sometimes applies enough activation energy\nto get it started. The other way to break the\nrules is not to care about them at all or perhaps even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries. Their ignorance of a field,\nignorance may be in quotes, but a field's assumptions\nact as a source of temporary, passive, independent mindedness. Aspies also seem to\nhave a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs. Several I know say that this\nhelps them to have new ideas. So the aggressive and the passive\nis such an interesting way of looking at it. Perhaps some aspect of this, at least in the story you\ntell this some passive aspect where you're like not even acknowledging, not even caring that there was rules, just kinda asking the simple question, and taking the simple action. - That was an essay I read, and we're doing just a snippet of it, but I would encourage anyone\nlistening to go and find it, and read the entire thing because\nit's something that really spoke to me as I was transitioning\ninto my new career now, and I just loved it. But when we were talking about\nwhy certain people who don't have traditional qualifications\nare able to come in, and do incredible work,\nand solve complex problems, it made me think of that essay,\nwhich is why I shared it. And I think that in the context\nof the work that I was doing here, perhaps not having\nthe historical context became an advantage, and\nobviously, went back, and then tried to study it. But you know, if you go into a problem, I always find that, especially\nin the political realm, my favorite political\nissues are ones where they're contrarian by being obvious. And you know, sometimes\nthey feel very intuitive, and so you take them on. There's always a lot of\nresistance when you go against something that's been accepted as the way that you're supposed to do things. And I came to learn over the\ncourse of my time in government that when everyone was\nagreeing with what I was doing, then it actually made me more\nnervous because I felt like you have these problems, they haven't been solved for a long time, and then if you take the\nsame approach as others, you're gonna fail just like they did. So taking a different approach\ndoesn't mean you're gonna succeed, but at least if you fail, you're gonna fail in an original way. And so I did like this a lot, and I, I think that what I saw was the people who were very\ngood at getting things done that hadn't been done\nbefore were people who came with different qualifications,\ndifferent perspectives, and they came in and\nreally worked the problem in untraditional ways. And so I think in the Middle\nEast I came in with a very different approach than people before me. Not because I came in deliberately trying to do it differently, but because I came in trying\nto listen and understand from people why the problem hadn't been solved. And then think from a first\nprinciple's perspective on what's the right perspective today. Not based on what happened 50 years ago, or not based on what somebody's\nfeelings who were hurt, but what's the right thing to\nmake people's lives better, to make the world a safer, and and more prosperous place tomorrow. - So if we can go back\nto MBS for a little bit, from the person to the vision, there's something called\nVision 2030 about his vision for Saudi Arabia in the future. Can you maybe look from his perspective, what is his vision for the region? - Sure. So, you know, it's funny, we were talking before\nabout how we wish leaders would set big audacious\ngoals and take on big things. Well, that's what he did with Vision 2030, you know, when he was young, and again, this is something that was\nderided, and a lot of people were very skeptical of it, but the people who actually\npicked it up and read it, said, \"This is a very thoughtful plan that's very achievable.\" So he studied his country and said, \"What's our place in the world? What are our advantages? What are our disadvantages?\" And then he set publicly KPIs\nthat he wanted to hold his country to and then put in\nplace plans and committees, and really worked hard to\npush things in that direction, which was pretty remarkable. I think that it's\nsomething, when I saw it, I thought it was very refreshing. I said, \"Wait, in America, why don't we all have,\nyou know, set goals? Why don't we have KPIs?\" And I do think that it's\nsomething that most countries, if not all countries should have, right? One of my favorite quotes was from the \"Alice in Wonderland,\"\nwhere the Cheshire Cat says, \"If you don't know where you're going, it doesn't matter which path you take.\" And so I think that that's\nsomething that really helped set them on a good path and they've been very successful with it. One of the things he told me\nabout putting that together was he said, \"My father's generation, they created this country\nfrom almost nothing. They came here, they were a poor country, they were Bedouins in the desert. And then they look back and\nsee what they've done over 50 years and they say \"It's\nabsolutely remarkable.\" He said, his generation,\nthey come in and they say, \"We're very grateful for everything that's been done to date. but we have so much opportunity that we're not taking advantage of.\" And so, you know, he's now empowered the next\ngeneration to be ambitious, and think big, and grow with it. What that means for his vision\nfor the Middle East is that, you know, the general\narchitecture that should exist. And now there's excitement in\nthe discussions with Israel that have advanced was the\ngeneral view of what we thought from a Trump perspective\nshould be the new Middle East is having an economic\nand security corridor, all the way from Haifa to\nMuscat, from Oman to Israel, where basically, you go\nthrough, and if you can create a security area where people can live free of fear, of\nterrorism, and of conflict. The Middle East for the last\n20 years has been a sinkhole for arms, for death, for terrorism. It's been, you know, awful. It's been a big national\nsecurity threat for America. A big place where our treasure has gone. We've had a lot of our, young, amazing American soldiers killed in action there. And the same thing for the\nArab countries as well. So if we can create a security\narchitecture for that region, and then we can create\neconomic integration between all the different countries. I mean, the amount of\ninnovation happening in Israel is unbelievable. Think of it like Silicon Valley's\nnot connected to the rest of California. You have a very young population, a very digital savvy population. You have a lot of resources. And so if you can get that whole set, the potential for it is unbelievable. I do think that that's his\nultimate vision is to become a really strong country economically, and then to become a place\nwhere you could be funding advancements in science,\nadvancements in humanity, advancements in artificial intelligence, and think about ways to\nbe a positive influence in the world. - So, a difficult question. One big source of tension\nbetween the United States and Saudi is the case of Jamal Khashoggi. I was wondering if you can\ncomment on what MBS has said about it to you. You've spoken to him about it, and what MBS has said about it publicly on \"60 minutes,\" and after. - Yeah, so what he said to me was no different than\nwhat he ultimately said on \"60 Minutes,\" which was, \"As somebody helping lead this country, I bear responsibility. And I'm gonna make sure\nthat those who are involved are brought to justice\nand I'm gonna make sure that we put in place reforms to make sure things like\nthis don't happen again.\" It was a horrible situation that occurred. What I saw from him after that was just a doubling and a tripling\ndown on the positive things he was doing. Figuring out ways to kind\nof continue to modernize his society, build\nopportunity in the kingdom, and to continue to be a better\nally to all the different countries that wanted\nto be aligned with them. - One thing I learned from\nthis case is how one particular situation, a tragedy, can\ndestroy so much progress, and the possibility of progress, and the possibility of\nconnection between the bridges that are built between different nations, and how narratives\naround that can take off, and take such a long time to repair. And you've worked with this\nin the Middle East with Israel and so on, how the\nhistory, the narratives, the stories, they kind\nof have this momentum that's so hard to break, even when you have new leaders, new blood, new ideas that come in. It's just sad to see that\nyes, this tragedy happens, but it doesn't mean that\nyou can't make progress. I dunno if you have kind\nof lessons from that, just how much of a dramatic\nimpact it had on creating tension between the\nUnited States and Saudi, and in general and the Middle East, like, that somehow, Saudi's not a friend, but is against the ideals and the values of the United States. - Yeah. So it did definitely\ncreated massive tension, and it became a very high-profile action that actually overshadowed\na lot of the good work that was being done in the region, and a lot of the progress we were making. But when you think about this\nor you think about the other issues that we've gone through today, I think the general framework\nthat I always try to approach things with is you can't\nchange what happened yesterday, you can only learn from it, and then you can change\nhow you deal with tomorrow. And when I think about, you\nknow, the people in power, what do I hope that they're\nspending their time focused on? Two basic things, number\none, is how do I create safety and security for my\npeople and for the world? And then how do I give people\nthe opportunity to live a better life? And so when things like this\nhappen, obviously, you know, there are certain reactions\nthat are appropriate, but ultimately, you have to\nthink through how do you not allow the paradigm that you're\ncreating in the world to lead to worse outcomes than\nwould happen otherwise? And so, when I would think\nabout foreign policy in general, one of the differences between\nforeign policy and business is that in business, the\nconclusion of a problem set, you finish a deal, you\neither have, you know, a company or a property,\nor if you sell it, you have less to do and, and\nmore capital, hopefully, if it's successful, right? In a political deal, it's\nalways about paradigms. So the end of a problem\nset is always the beginning of a new paradigm. And you're always thinking\nthrough how do you create an environment that leads to\nhopefully the best amount of positive outcomes that could occur versus creating a paradigm that will lead to negative outcomes. So, bad things happen a lot in the world, and you have to make sure\nthat when those happen, people are held accountable for it. But you also don't wanna\nmake sure that in the process of making sure that there's accountability for these actions, you don't set a lot of progress\nthat the world is making back, that will lead\nto worse off situation for many more people. - If we can go back to the\nincredible work with Abraham Accords, and Israel, and the Middle East. First, the big question about peace. Why is it so difficult to\nachieve peace in this part of the world between Israel and Palestine, and between Israel and the other countries in the Middle East, or any sort of peace-like agreements? - If I had to give you\nthe most simple answer, I would say that it's structural. And if you go back to the\nincentive structure of different leaders, this whole peace\nprocess between Israel and the Palestinians, and again, I've gotten criticized for saying this, but it's what I believe,\nso I'm gonna say it, is that the incentive\nstructure was all wrong. And when I went before the\nUnited Nations Security Council to discuss the peace plan that I proposed, which again, was more\nof an operational plan, and it was a pragmatic plan, it was over 180 pages in detail. In politics, people don't\nlike putting forward detail because it just\ngives a lot of places for you to get criticized on. Nobody actually criticized\nthe detail of my plan. They just criticized the fact\nthat it was coming from us, and didn't want to debate the merits of the operational pieces of it. So I created a slide where I\nshowed from the Oslo Accords till the day I was there, all the different peace discussions. I put a dove in the slide for those, and then I put a tank for\nevery time there was a war. 'cause there was always\nskirmishes between Hamas, and Hezbollah, and the Palestinians. And then I showed two lines, and they both went from the\nbottom of the page all the way up like this. One of the lines was Israeli settlements. So every time a negotiation failed, Israel was able to get more land, and then the other one was\nmoney to the Palestinians. And I said, \"Every time\na negotiation failed, the Palestinians would get more money.\" The problem with that money though, was that it wasn't going to the people, some of it would make its way down, but most of it was going\nto the politicians. You had leadership of the\nPalestinians who was basically, I think at that point it\nwas in like the 16th year of a four-year term, so it\nwasn't democratically elected. And a lot of what I tried to\nshow was that there was no rule of law, there was no judicial system, there were no property rights, and there was no opportunity\nor hope for the people to live a better life. And so all of the envoys to\ndate were basically trained to go and do the same things. And again, I got massively criticized by all the previous\nenvoys for not doing it the same way they did, but I thought the problem structurally just didn't make sense. And so I felt like the incentive\nstructure was all wrong, and I took a different approach. - And so what's the different approach? - I started writing down a document. These are the 11 issues, but there's really only\nthree issues that matter. I said, \"Just tell me what you think the compromise is that\nyou think the other side could live with, that you would accept.\" And it was very hard to get\nthem talking about this. \"Oh, you have to go back to 1972. You have to go back to 1982. You have to go back to 2001.\" And I was just like, \"I don't need a headache, and I don't need a history lesson. Just, I want a very simple\nthing, here, today, in 2017, what's the outcome that you would accept?\" And I was dealing with their negotiators, their back channel, secret\nnegotiators, their double secret. And I was just like,\n\"This whole thing is like, it's a process created\nwhere nobody wants to talk about the actual solution.\" So coming from the business\nworld, I said, \"Okay, lemme just write down a proposed solution that I think is fair and\nlet me have each side react. Like, don't tell me\nabout theoretical things. Like, tell me I wanna move\nthe line from here to here. I want to change this word. So I tried to make it much more tactical. And what I realized was,\nlike, the Palestinians, they'd worked so hard to\nget the Arab world to stay with the line of the\nArab Peace Initiative. And so I went back and I read\nthe Arab Peace Initiative. It was 10 lines and it\ndidn't have any details. So it was a concept. And so they liked that concept\nbecause it allowed them to reject everything. They kept getting more money. I mean, Bibi Netanyahu, who runs one of the most\nincredible economies in the world, who runs an incredible superpower\nmilitarily for the size of their country, he would\nfly to Washington to meet us, and he'd be taking a commercial LL plane, a boss who runs a refugee\norganization, a refugee group, right, that claims that\nthey don't have a state, that gets billions of dollars\nin aid ever every year from the global community would fly in a $60 million Boeing, BBJ. So the whole thing was\njust very corrupt and off. And I do think that that's why it, I don't think people were\nincentivized to solve it, to be honest. - What do you think an\nactual plan on that part, if you can, just before we\ntalk about Abraham Accords, if there is a peace plan\nthat works between Israel and Palestine, what do\nyou think it looks like? You have to separate it\ninto two different issues. And I think that that's actually\nhow we came to the Abraham Accords is that, you know, I tell the story in the book,\nand it was one of my, like, favorite experiences during\nmy time in diplomacy, where I went to meet with Sultan Qaboos, who was the sultan of Oman. And we fly out there because\nhe'd had a secret meeting with Bibi, and I thought maybe he was open to normalizing with Israel. So after he meets with\nBibi, he calls me and says, \"I want you to come see me.\" So I go over to see him, again, I tell the story,\nit was a crazy night, and all these different areas, but when I was talking to\nhim, he basically says to me, \"I feel badly for the Palestinian people that they carry with them the\nburden of the Muslim world.\" And that line just like stuck with me. And a couple days later I was\nthinking about it and I said, \"Wait a minute. Who elected the Palestinian\npeople to represent the Muslim world on the Al-Aqsa Mosque? And so the reason why I felt\nlike it had never been solved was it was a riddle, A, that I believed was designed to not be solved. But B, you were conflating\ntwo separate issues. You had the issue between Israel\nand, and the Muslim world, which really was the issue\nof the Al-Aqsa Mosque. And then you had just\na territorial dispute, which throughout history, you have lots of territorial disputes, and they're usually\nresolved in different ways. So if you go back to the\nIsraeli-Palestinian issue, there's just a couple\ncomponents you need to solve. Number one is territorial\ncontinuity, right? You need to figure out\nwhere do you draw the lines? And that's something that, you know, you can talk about what\npeople were owed 70 years ago, but it's much more productive to say, \"This is what you can\nmake work today,\" right? And that's kind of what we did. We literally spent months and months drawing a map and we put something out, probably change a couple\nlines here and there, but by and large, it was a very pragmatic solution\nthat I think could work. And I think it could work\nfor the safety and security of Israel, which was number one. So first issue, is drawing a map. Second issue, is security. Again, Israel. And again, this is one\nissue we were incredibly sympathetic with Israel, which is you can't expect, you know, a prime minister of Israel to make a deal where he's gonna make his\npeople less secure than before. So we worked very closely with\nthem on a security apparatus. We laid something out that I\nthink would keep the whole area safer, and it would sure Israel was safe, and also keep the Palestinian issue safe. She needs security. Number three was the religious sites, and that was one that was\nactually always made much more complicated by people, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, because you basically\nhave Haram al-Sharif, which is a place where the\nmosque was built in the seventh or eighth century, but\noriginally it was where the Holy of Holies were\nin the Bet ha-Midrash for the Jewish people. So, and then, compounding by the fact that you have all the Christian\nholy sites in Jerusalem, it's a city that should be\nbringing everyone together, but in fact has become a place\nwhere you have, you know, wars and, and hatred, and a\nlot of different conflicts that have risen because of it. But what I said was, instead\nof fighting over concepts of sovereignty, which is interesting how I got to the notion that this wasn't really the big issue. I basically just operationally, why don't we just make it simple? Let everyone come and be able\nto worship as long as they're being able to worship peacefully. So that's really the contours of it. And what the Palestinians\nhave done is they've kind of deflected from a lot\nof their own shortcomings. And a lot of the Arab\nleaders did that as well, kind of in the pre Abraham\nAccord days by kind of allowing this issue to be so prevalent. So one thing I'll say on the\nPalestinians is that, you know, what we tried to do by laying\nadded plan was we said, \"Okay, what are the reasons why the\nPalestinian people are not having the lives that they deserve?\" And I'll give you a couple things. One is, I studied the\neconomies of Jordan, West Bank, Gaza, Egypt, Morocco. This was numbers from like 2019. But what was interesting\nwas the GDP per capita of somebody living in the West Bank was actually the same as Jordan. And it was actually more than\nsomebody living in Egypt. And the debt of GDP that the\nPalestinians had was like 30, 40% compared to Egypt,\nwhich was at like 130%. In Jordan, which was at 110%, then Lebanon, which is about 200%. And so, you know, you're in a situation\nwhere a lot of this stuff didn't make sense, but if you draw lines, create institutions where\nPalestinian people can now feel like they have property\nrights and have ownership over their place, and let the money flow\npass the leadership ranks to the people, let them have jobs, let them have opportunity, and then let all Muslims from\nthroughout the world have access to the mosque. And Israel making sure that\nthey can control the security, which I think the Jordanians\nand a lot of others want Israel to have strong security control there to prevent the radicalists and\nthe extremists from coming. You could have peace there very easily. - So there's a lot of things to say here. One is just to emphasize Al-Aqsa Mosque. So this holy place, and this is something in our\nconversations and in my own travels, I've seen the\nimportance of sort of frictionless access to those sites from the entirety of the Muslim world. And that's what Abraham\nAccords took big leaps on. Okay, so we'll talk about\nthat a little bit more, but that's kind of a religious component, that's a dignity in\nthe religious practice, and faith component. But then the other thing\nyou mentioned so simply, which is you have money flow\npast the leadership ranks. How do you have money flow\npast the leadership ranks in Palestine? So make sure that the money\nthat's invested in Palestine, the West Bank gets to the people. - So to date, all of the aid that's been\ngiven to the Palestinians has been an entitlement. It's not conditions\nbased, it's always just, we give them money and\nthere's no expectations. It's very simple, you make\nthe aid conditions based, you fight for transparency. You do it through institutions\nother than the PA, or you put reformers into the PA that will allow it to go down that way. - PA being the Palestinian Authority, which is the leadership.\n- It's not hard to do, it just takes people who\nactually wanna do it. But I think the mindset of\nthe international community has not been, \"Let's solve this problem.\" It's like, \"Let's just\nthrow a little bit of money. The money's Novocaine, let's put a little\nNovocaine on the problem, and let's not have to deal with it.\" But nobody's ever said, \"Oh, let's do an accounting of the $20 billion we've given them and see\nhow many jobs it's done, and where it's gone.\" That just hasn't happened. Again. It's an incredibly\ncorrupt organization, UNRWA. You think about the\npost-World War II dynamic, you had a lot of refugees. My grandparents were\nrefugees post-World War II. Every other refugee\nclass has been resettled, and you only have one\npermanent refugee organization ever created. Why was this done? It was done to perpetuate the\nconflict so that a lot of Arab leaders could basically deflect from a lot of their shortcomings at home. And so I think for Israel, they view all these things as existential. They value their safety. They've been under attack for a long time. I do think having a deal where we can say, \"The Jews, and the Muslims,\nChristians, come together. I think King Abdullah from\nJordan's been an incredible custodian for the mosque. I think everyone in my travels\nrecognize that he's the right guy for that, that the king of Jordan\nshould be the custodian of the mosque. We should have some kind of framework to make sure everyone has access. The more countries that have\ndiplomatic relations with Israel, the more Muslims and Arabs that should be able to come and visit. And by the way, the more you\nhave these normalizations, think about what that will\ndo to the economy of the West Bank, where they'll have,\ngreat hotels, hospitality, tremendous tourism industry,\nbecause of all the Christian, Muslim, and Jewish holy\nsites that they have there. So there's a lot of potential there. We just have to get unstuck. I believe that it's so possible\nif the leaders wanna make tomorrow better, that they can. And unfortunately, the people who suffer the most are really, are just the Palestinian people. And I think that, you know, in Gaza, they're hostages to Hamas,\nand in the West Bank, they're just held back, because their leadership just is afraid, or too self-interested to\ngive them the opportunity to change their paradigm, and pursue the potential\nof what they have. And by the way, it's an incredibly\nwell-educated population. It's an incredibly capable population, and they're right next to\nIsrael where the economy, they need everything. And so the potential should be incredible, if you can just move some of these pieces. But again, there's still a lot of emotion, and hatred you have to\nwork through as well. But I do believe that you're\nnot gonna solve that by litigating the past. You're only gonna solve\nthat by creating an exciting paradigm for the future and\ngetting everyone to buy in, and then move towards that. - And maybe increase\nthe chance of being able to establish an economy\nwhere the entrepreneurs can flourish in the West\nBank and so on in Palestine, once the, the relationship across the Arab world is normalized. - So one thing on that,\nwhich is very interesting, is when I got into my job in,\nin, in, in the Middle East, all of the conventional\nthinkers said to me, \"The separation in the\nMuslim world is between the Sunnis and the Shias.\" And that's really the big divide. And as I was traveling, I didn't think there was\nany divide in that regard. The divide that I saw was between\nleaders who wanted to give a better opportunity for their\npeople and create economic reforms and opportunity, and\nleaders who wanted to use religion or fear to keep\ntheir stronghold on power. And so if you think about who's\nnot creating the opportunity for their people, is the Palestinian leadership\nand the Iranian leadership, all the other Arab\ncountries were focused on, \"How do we give opportunity for our people to live a better life?\" - And there is big foundation\non which that framework can succeed, which I\nthink is the, in general, the idea of Arab-Israeli normalization. So that's where Abraham Accords come in. Can you tell the story of that? - Sure. So it's an amazing thing, and I sit here today,\nsomebody not in government, and every day I see, another flight that goes between, or I see an Israeli student studying\nat a university in Dubai, or a new synagogue\nopening up in Abu Dhabi. And it just gives me such, or Bahrain, it gives me such tremendous\npride to see all of the progress that's been made. How it occurred, part\nof why I wrote the book was to put this down for history's sake, to go through all the different\nintentional, unintentional, circumstantial things that occurred. It's funny, we left government, there's a lot of people\nsaying, \"Well, this is why.\" I said, \"I was kind of\nat the middle of it,\" and I couldn't even perfectly\narticulate why it happened, because it was in evolution\nof a lot of things. And I joke that we made peace on plan C, but only because we went through\nthe alphabet three times, failing at every letter, and by the time, but we didn't give up, and we kept going, and we got it done. - And maybe this is a good\nplace to also step back and say what is Arab-Israeli normalization? What is the state of things\nfor people who may not be aware before the progress you made? - That's probably the best place to start. So what we did is we\nmade a peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and then Israel and Bahrain. Then we did a deal with Israel and Sudan, then Israel and Kosovo, Israel, Morocco, where basically countries that\ndidn't recognize each other before ended up recognize each other. All of these were Muslim\nmajority countries. And getting them to integrate with Israel was a very big thing. The traditional thinking had always been, was that Muslim Arab countries\nwould not make peace with Israel until the Israeli-Palestinian\nissue was solved. And what we were able to do is\nseparate the issues and then make these connections, which are leading to amazing\ninteraction between Jews and Muslims. So when I think about kind of, obviously, you have national security, you have emotional\nbenefits from these things, but the single biggest benefit that I've seen from the Accords is that if you were an Arab or a Muslim, and you were willing to say\npositive things about Israel or the Jews before this came out, you had been viciously attacked\nby the media or the hordes of influencers or the\nextremists in these different countries. What this did, was it\nbrought out into the public the fact that Jews and\nMuslims can be together, and they can be respectful. They can have meals together, and that the cultures can\nlive together in peace. - So just to linger on this, it's like a once subtle\nand in another sense, like, transformative. So normalization means\nyou're allowed to travel a foreign place together. - That has a kinda ripple effect. Of that, you can now start talking in a little bit more accepting way. You can start integrating,\ntraveling, communicating, doing business with, socializing. So the cultures mix. Conversations mix, all of this, and this kind of has a ripple\neffect on the basic connection between these previously disparate worlds. I don't know if there's a, a\nnice way to kind of make clear why these agreements have\nsuch a transformative effect, especially in the long term. - I would say the simplest\nform is it's just a mindset. And it's almost like\nyou're taught all your life we're enemies, or we can't\nbe friends with that tribe on the other side of the fence. And then like one day the\nleaders get up and say, \"No, it's okay now.\" And there was never an\nissue between the people. The people were just taught\ndifferent things and they were separated from each other. But again, one of the\nthings that I respect about the work you do is\nyou believe in the power of conversation and the\npower of human interaction. And you know, these issues, and gaps between us feel so\nbig when we think about them, when we're told about them,\nwhen we read about them. But when we go and sit with each other, all of a sudden we realize\nmaybe we have a lot more in common than we have that divides us. For me, what I've seen about it that's\nmade the biggest difference, is I've seen people who\nwouldn't have the ability to be together, be together. And that's now forming a\nnucleus of togetherness, which is a restoration. So you think about the modern Middle East from post Holocaust to\nnow, again, in 1948, after that War of Independence, you had Jews living in Baghdad and Cairo, then they became so anti-Jewish, that they then expelled\nall of the Jews from all of these capitals of those cities. So you think about the Jewish\nhistory in Baghdad, I mean, I think the Talmud was written in Baghdad. It was a place where in Babylon, where the Jewish people thrived, I think in five 570 BC, when Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem, he took about 10,000 Jews\nback with him to Babylon, because he thought it'd\nbe good for his economy. And during that place, the Jews actually flourished\nand had a good life there. So for 1,000 years before\nthe Second World War, the Jews and the Muslims lived\nvery peacefully together. So people say that what we're doing now is an aberration. I actually\nthink it's not an aberration. I think it's actually a return\nto the time where people can live together culturally. And so this is the beginning\nof the end of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and it's the\nbeginning of togetherness, which again, you think about how much war, how much provocation, how much terrorism has\nbeen made in the name of religious conflict. This is, I think the start of the process of religious respect and understanding. - We've talked about you\nbeing attacked in the press for the Russian collusion\nand other topics. One of the most recent set\nof attacks comes on the topic of Saudi public investment fund, giving $2 billion to your\ninvestment firm after you left government. So that includes a 1.25%\nasset management fee of $25 million a year. Can you respond to these\nrecent set of attacks? - Sure. So, left government. Obviously, worked for four years. It was a very action-packed time, that's why I wrote the book. I wanted to put down\nall those experiences. I started thinking like,\n\"What do I wanna do next?\" Right? So my previous career,\nI'd been in real estate. I worked with my brother on\nsome technology businesses that I'd started, and then\nI got into government. So I kind of had a career shift, right? In my previous career, obviously, was very successful. The New York Times, they violated, and they published\nmy financial statements. They showed I was making\nabout $50 million a year in the private sector\nbefore I went to government. I went into government, I volunteered. I didn't take a salary. I paid for my own health\ninsurance for four years, my wife and I. And then we went, and I was thinking, \"Should I go back to my old company, or should I start something new?\" And my thinking was, is that I'd, through my time in government,\nI'd met so many people, I'd learned so much about the world. I had a big understanding\nnow for how the macroeconomic picture worked. And I did feel like there was\na lot more that I could do than just going back to real estate. In the meantime, I was getting a lot of\ncalls from different CEOs, and companies saying, \"Can you help me with this company? Can you help me with that company? Your knowledge could be\nhelpful to help this company navigate this challenge or\nto expand internationally.\" And so I said, \"You know what? Maybe I should create a business\nto do an investment firm where I can do something\ndifferent, where I'm putting together geopolitical expertise,\nand traditional private equity, and growth investing, and figure out how to do that, where I can do something differentiated, where I can invest in growing things, and help with my navigation\nskills and relationships.\" So that was kind of the thesis\nof what I thought could make sense as kind of a next step. I called, you know, different friends. They were very excited\nto, to back the effort. Obviously, this was coming off the success that I just had in the\nMiddle East where I did six peace deals there. And, you know, one of the notions I wanted\nto be able to do with the firm was to be able to take money\nfrom the Gulf and then to be able to invest it in Israel, to continue to build the economic links between the countries. Again, if countries\nhave more economic ties, I think war and fighting is less likely. And then in addition to that, I wanted to figure out how do\nyou bring the entrepreneurs together from both of those countries. So that was really the mission\nof what I set out to do. So far, I've been enjoying it. It's been a lot of fun,\nI've been learning a ton. I think we're doing very well with it. In terms of the criticisms, I think that I've been\ncriticized in every step of everything I've always done in my life. And so what I would say is, you know, this business is actually an\nobjective metric business. Right? It's about returns. So, you know, in three,\nfour years from now, five years from now, see how I do, hopefully, I'll do very well,\nand judge me based on that. In terms of any of the\nnefarious things, you know, I haven't been accused of\nany of violating any laws. And, you know, I haven't violated any of\nthe ethics rules either. When I was in government,\nevery year submitted all my financial to the\nOffice of Government Ethics. They certified it every year. And I followed every rule\nand every law possible. So, to my critics, I'll say, \"Criticize me before,\nyou'll criticize me now.\" I'm gonna keep doing me\nand I'm gonna keep pursuing things that I think are worthwhile. And I'm very excited about\nthis chapter of my career. Maybe this is a good place to\nask in working closely with Donald Trump, what, in your\nsense, looking into the mind of the man, what's the biggest strength of Donald Trump as a leader? - I would say his unpredictability. I think that as a leader, he\nconsumes a ton of information. He doesn't like to be managed\nor have his information filtered. So he'll speak to a lot of people to draw his information himself. He's very pragmatic. I don't see him as terribly ideological. I see him as somebody who's about results. I think he wants to deliver results. And I think ultimately, I mean, he's an incredible fighter. He's a big counter puncher, but he also wants to\nget along with people. And that's probably the biggest\nsurprise that people found with him. I mean, you look at even situations, like, I would always tell people,\n\"If you disagree with him, don't go on television and criticize him. Just pick up the phone and\ncall him, and go see him, and he'll talk to you about it.\" He may not agree with you, but again, that's what Kim Kardashian\ndid when she had a case of clemency with a woman, Alice Johnson, that she felt strongly about,\nwe went through the case. I wouldn't have had her call\nif I didn't think it was a legitimate case. So we spent about eight\nmonths quietly working through the case, working through the details to make sure that it really was a worthy case. I brought it to President Trump said, \"She'd like to come meet with you to talk about this case.\" And he said, \"Have her come in.\" So she came in, we went through the case, and President Trump ultimately\ngranted the clemency to Alice Johnson, who was a woman who was\naccused of being part of a drug ring. She had, basically, a life\nsentence for doing it. She'd served 22 years in prison. While in prison, I mean, she\nbasically was a grandmother. And she putting on the prison plays. She was mentoring young women in prison. Somebody who, again,\nthere's always a risk, but by and large had a\nvery, very, very low risk of committing a crime in the future. And then it goes back to the notion of, are we gonna judge people\nby the worst decision they make in their life? And so President Trump was\nwilling to grant the clemency. And it went. And I think that it just\ngoes to the notion of like, maybe this goes back to his\nunpredictability in a positive way, which is, if you go sit with him, and you make your case, he'll hear you, he'll listen to you. And he is not afraid to act. And he's not afraid to be controversial, which I think is a good thing. So from a foreign policy\npoint of view, in particular, his unpredictability just meant\nthat everyone was always on their back foot. People were afraid to\nkind of cross America. And what I would tell\npeople who don't like Trump, as I would say, \"Think about\nhow crazy he's making you, and his enemies. He did that to the enemies of America.\" So he was a very, very strong president, and I think did a, a great job. - So in some of these agreements I've been talking about\nand speaking with leaders, how do you think the\nunpredictability helps? - So in all the agreements\nthat I was negotiating, I wasn't doing it as a principle. I was doing it on behalf\nof President Trump, and people knew that I had\naccess to President Trump, and they knew that, you know, I could say, you may say this that we don't like, but I'm gonna have to take it back to him, and then we'll see what he does. And one of the biggest\ninstances was on the USMCA trade deal, where that deal\nhappened because Mexico was legitimately concerned, and smartly so, that\nPresident Trump was going to impose tariffs on the car industry, which would've been\ndecimating to their economy. And by the way, he was ready to do it. We were holding him back from\ndoing it with every ounce of strength that we could,\nso it wasn't a bluff. I mean, that was actually real. But they were smart to\nread that it was real. And ultimately we created\na great win-win deal. Tell you a funny story\njust popped into my mind from the tariffs, is we did also, we used a 232 national security\nexemption to protect our steel industry, and we put tariffs\non steel and aluminum. And again, I thought about this, 'cause we also negotiated\nthem with Canada, and there was a very funny\nphone call where Trudeau is calling Trump. And again, they got along,\nyou know, decently well. And Trudeau's calling and saying, \"You can't put national security\ntariffs on us in Canada. We're, we're your NATO ally. We fought wars with you,\nwe do military together.\" And Trump says to him, \"Didn't you burn the\nWhite House down in 1812?\" And Trudeau says, \"That was the French.\" He says, \"No, it was the Canadians.\" And so it was just, you know, like I said, he's always keeping\neveryone on their toes. He took very calculated risks. And like I said, you know, everyone was outraged all\nthe time with everything. But if you look at his body of work, people said if he was elected,\nhe would start World War III. Meanwhile, we inherited\na world filled with wars, no new wars, right? Three years, he made\npeace deals, no new wars. He was tough, he was strong. People respected him, he built relationships,\nand got trade deals done, got peace deals done,\nthe economy was rocking. His body of work, I think, was\npretty strong as president. - Like you said, no new wars. This makes me think if Donald\nTrump won the presidency, what the current situation\nin Ukraine would look like. But let me just ask you zoom\nout and ask you broadly. Do you think the war in Ukraine\ncould have been avoided? And what do you think it\ntakes to bring it to an end? - I think a 100% it would've\nbeen avoided, not 99%, You know, President Trump for four years had no problems with Russia. You know, we were arming Ukraine, but we were working with Russia. And again, the first two years we had a\nlittle bit of issue working with Russia because they were\naccused of colluding with us. And so we had to go\nthrough that investigation. But in the second two years, we were trying to focus\nRussia on what are the areas where we can collaborate together. I think Russia, you know, we thought it was in their\nstrategic advantage to play US and China against each other, because of the way that\neverything was done before. They were stuck with China, but not getting a lot for it. Under Bush, they took Georgia, Under Obama, they took Crimea. Under Trump, there was no problems. And then under Biden, unfortunately, I think they misplayed a couple of things, which I think provoked\nRussia to go forward. Still no excuse to do what they did. I think that the invasion\nwas a terrible thing, and should not have occurred. But with that being said, I think 100%, if Trump was president, there would not be a war in Ukraine today. - Coming to the table\nand negotiating a piece, whether it's Donald\nTrump, whether it's Biden, whether it's anybody, what\ndo you think it takes? Do you think it's possible? And if you're in a room, if\nJared Kushner is in the room, with Vladimir Putin\nand Volodymyr Zelensky, what does it take to have\na productive conversation, and what does it take for\nthat conversation to fail? Like what are the trajectories\nthat lead to success and failure? - I think we go back to negotiations. Number one, is trust, right? Both leaders have to have the\nability to communicate what an off-ramp is without fearing it's gonna leak to the public. So if you go to the posture\nof Zelensky right now. And by the way, President Zelensky I have a lot of respect\nfor the courage he showed, especially initially. You saw what Ghani did in Afghanistan. They were getting attacked by the Taliban. He took the cash and got\nthe hell outta there. Staying in, in Kiev when he did, how he did it, was one\nof the most brave things we've seen in a long time. And he has a ton of my\nrespect and admiration for doing that. But now, he's promising his\npeople we're gonna win the war and the military action has\nnot necessarily coincided with that sentiment. And so there has to be\nsome form of off-ramp, but he can't say that publicly. So for him to be able to\nwork privately with somebody who can help create a new paradigm where both leaders can say,\n\"We're gonna stop the bloodshed. We're gonna stop the risk of\nnuclear war for the world, we're gonna stop what's happening.\" That's really what it will\ntake. How that occurs, again, it's not something I'm involved in now. So I don't know who the right\nbroker is or how to put that together, but essentially,\nthey need somebody in between them who can figure out, how do you create a landing\nzone that that works? 'cause neither party's\ngonna jump until the pool is filled with water. And it, you have to outline\nwhat the go forward looks like, because you can't just stop\nit for them to get worse for both parties. You have to move it forward\ninto what happens next, that hopefully, can start to turn the tide to benefit both sides, where they can focus on the\nfuture instead of being stuck into the old paradigm of who started what, who's to blame for what,\nwho did what to who. It's just a lot of tough stuff\nnow that that's occurred, that's gonna be hard to walk back. And it's a big task to get it done, but for the sake of the world, it'd be amazing if we were\nable to reach a conclusion to that conflict. - Just going back to your\nearlier mention of North Korea, what do you think it takes\nto bring Vladimir Putin, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy\nto the table together? - Leadership. - So you're saying like it\nhas to be a US president. - It has to be somebody\nwho's willing to put themself on the line to go and do it, And, again, if you're the US president\nand you're the most powerful nation in the world, you should be trying. But I do think, again, the posture that the US\nhas taken has probably been in a place where they, it would be very hard for 'em\nto get the trust of Russia, based on the way that they've\nplayed their moves to date. And I always thought from the\nbeginning that Putin would try to bring in President Xi\nin China to resolve it, to basically give a big\nscrew you to America to say, \"China's now the one in charge of this.\" But that hasn't seemed to\nmanifest itself to date either. But it takes leadership, you know, the leaders have to get it and say, \"Let's get everyone together, and let's try to get this done.\" Because every day it goes\non, A, more people are dying, and, B, you know, we do risk\nnuclear war for the world, which is not a good situation. - Let me ask, since you\nhelped set up phone calls between Donald Trump, Putin,\nand King of Saudi Arabia. If I were to interview Putin,\nwhat advice would you give on how to get a deep\nunderstanding of the human being? - Yeah, so I didn't\ndeal with Russia a ton, but in my interaction with,\nwith Putin and with Russia, you know, I would kind of\npoint out a couple of things. Number one, is when America was\nhit with COVID, and New York was looking like we were\ngonna run out of ventilators and masks, Russia was the second country that sent us a plane load of supplies. And they didn't send that\nbecause they hate America. They sent that because we\nwere starting to make progress together as countries. And they thought that they\nwanted to show goodwill to figure out how can we start working together. And again, people may attack me for saying that that sounds naive. Again, the past, you know, 15 years may show that\nthat's not the case, but I don't believe that\ncountries have permanent enemies, and I don't believe countries\nhave permanent allies, right? Again, you think about the US\nand Russia and World War II, we worked together to\ndefeat the Nazis, right? And now we're great allies with Germany, who basically was our great\nenemy in World War II. We're great allies with Japan, who's our great enemy in World War II. So it goes back to the notion\nwe discussed earlier of you shouldn't condemn tomorrow\nto be like yesterday, if you're unhappy with yesterday. So, so number one, is, I\nwould definitely ask him about that. The phone call that you mentioned\nwas after we did a pretty intense negotiation to\ncreate the largest oil cut in the history of oil production. So during COVID, demand\njust shut off like crazy, and it was stopping very quickly. Saudi and Russia at that\ntime were having conflict. They created this thing called OPEC+, which goes back, again, history between the two countries\nwhere they had conflicts, and then, all of a sudden, they\nwere working together to try to stabilize the oil markets, but they couldn't agree on the cuts. So Saudi actually increased production. So you had two things hitting\nat once where Saudi and Russia were both increasing production\nand demand was dropping. So you were headed for a real crisis. And I was starting to get\ncalls from a lot of the oil industry executives\nhere in America saying, \"You don't understand, we can't just like flip a switch, and turn off our oil wells. We're running out of storage here.\" And I said, \"Look, President\nTrump likes low oil prices, so he's not upset about what's happening. You have to call him, and if he gives me\npermission or the instruction then I can try to intervene. But right now, he's not\ninclined to intervene. After a little bit, he\nsaid, \"You know what? It's time, get involved, go do it.\" It was right over Passover,\nthis was during COVID. I spent three days nonstop on\nthe phone with Caril Demetria from Russia and with, with MBS directly. And I was dealing with Dan Brouillette who was our energy minister,\ngoing back-and-forth. And it was, like, it was crazy. I mean, it was just one of\nthe craziest negotiations. We ended up agreeing on the\nlargest oil cut in the history of the world. But the story you went to before, which was pretty funny,\nwas finally make the deal. And we set up a call between\nKing Salman, Vladimir Putin, and President Trump to announce the deal. And I'm like, \"Oh, this is great this.\" so President Trump gets\non, says, \"Congratulations. We have a deal. And then King Salman says,\n\"We don't have a deal. Mexico hasn't agreed to their cuts.\" He's said, \"What do you mean?\" And so they were part of the OPEC+. And so I get a note saying,\n\"You gotta go call Mexico.\" So I'm calling Mexico, they're saying \"We're not doing any cuts.\" I said, \"Why? I said, \"We're hedged at $55.\" I said, \"Why didn't you tell\nus that at the beginning?\" So I'm telling the Saudis. So we were working\nthrough this whole thing. So meanwhile, we were trying to find the compromise with Mexico. I set up a call with Trump and Putin, so they can kind of talk this through. And he was always trying to\nplay the game of how do we get Russia, A, away from China? He always thought that that\nwas not the right strategic framework for US interests. And again, we had no problems\nwith them during that time. What I would say is that\nfor Zelenskyy and Putin, any conversation with both of\nthem is about understanding their perspective. I think with Putin, he's\na student of history from the things that I saw with him. If you look at Russia\nover the last 500 years, I think they were attacked\nby the Polish in early 1600. I think they were attacked\nby the Swedes in the 1700s. I think they were attacked\nby Napoleon in the 1800s. And then in the 1900s, they\nwere attacked by Germany twice, and so from his\nperspective, there is, you know, in the early days of Russia, they were attacked by the Mongols. They were very vulnerable. And a lot of the geography\nof Russia today is really designed for defensive purposes, that they have natural\nbarriers that makes them easier to defend. And Russia's a massive landmass, it's twice the size of America. They have 11 times zones in the country. And so I do think that for Vladimir Putin, his biggest concern is, \"How do we create a security paradigm in the west of his country\nthat won't be a creep. And I think that there's like\ntwo different parts of the mindset, you know the\npeople who are most cynical of Putin will say, \"Well, he's just trying to recreate the USSR. He's being expansionist.\" And the people who wanna be\nsympathetic to him will say, \"Well, if you think about it, the Russian perception\nof the NATO arrangement, was that they wouldn't\nbe expanding westward.\" Over the last years, they've included all these countries that they said they promised\nthey wouldn't include, who knows what the\npromises were, or weren't. But what I do know from his\nperspective is allowing Ukraine into NATO was always a red line. And that's why we never offered it. We never provoked it, we never brought it up. We said \"We're gonna arm 'em.\" And we basically said, \"Just calm down. We don't want any conflicts there. We have bigger issues\nand bigger opportunities to work from.\" So I do think you have to\nthink through what's a paradigm that he can accept. And I do think that, you know, he'll give the justification\nfor why he's done what he's done. And then I think the framework\nfor a solution is about how do we move both parties forward? Tough job. I hope you get the opportunity to do it, because I think it's a conversation that will only help the world, hopefully, find a pathway forward. - And I should mention, 'cause\nyou mentioned geography, one of the many books\nyou've recommended to me that gives a very interesting\nperspective on history, it's called \"Prisoners of\nGeography\" by Tim Marshall. And it has a very interesting perspective on the geopolitical conflicts\nand perspective of Russia from a geography perspective, and also for China in the second chapter. And there's a lot of\nunderstanding of why the expansion of NATO is such a concern for Russia, because geography still,\neven in the 21st century, less and less so because\nof technology and so on, but it still plays a major\nrole in conflicts between nations, rivers, and mountains. - And understanding the DNA of countries. It was one of the most phenomenal books. I just found it on Amazon randomly, but I loved every minute of it. The chapter on America is also incredible. Going through the evolution of, you know, how we became the country we are, the different acquisitions,\nthe different changes, why we have all these\ngeographic advantages. And it's an unbelievable book for anyone who's interested in geopolitics. - So I have to ask on\nseveral aspects of China, first on the president. The meeting, you helped\nset up a first call, and first meeting between\nDonald Trump and Xi Jinping, can you tell the story of that? Because that's also interesting, again, that first phone call, the reaching out, the forming the human connection, which ultimately leads to the\nconnection between nations, and the possibility of collaboration. - So during the transition, President Trump took a call\nfrom the head of Taiwan, and that sent the Chinese\ninto a real tailspin. And he didn't do it I think\nto be provocative to them, as much as just as a businessman. He felt, you answer your call, somebody wants to speak\nto you, you speak to him. Like, you wanna have conversations, hear their point of view. But it was taken as a very\nbig insult and it was against tradition and norm. And so that was something that set us off in a wrong direction. My view at the time was that, you know, we are kind of entering a G2 world, whether people wanna admit it or not. And that a lot of these countries, in what I call the\nmiddle market countries, were basically playing, this is when China was\nbeing aggressive with their One Belt One Road. They were basically playing us\nand China against each other. And I thought that by the\ntwo leaders coming together, there were some things\nthey wouldn't agree on, but there was a lot that\nthey probably could agree on, which could lead to resolutions to a lot\nof issues in the world. That was like my most optimistic view. My most, more pragmatic view, was that President Trump\nhad very big issues on trade that he wanted to get to with China. He felt like China, their\ntrade practices were unfair. They weren't following all\nthe global rules of trade. He was a little bit nervous\nthat they would be provocative with Taiwan. And I felt like the two\nof them getting together would be the best way\nto try and resolve that. So the Chinese are very proud,\nand a lot of it's about face. And so we, in order to\nnegotiate for that first call, we basically agreed on what\nwould happen in the call. So not, let's just have a call,\nsay, \"Hi, nice to meet you.\" It was a question of President Trump basically agreed that he would acknowledge the One China policy, which he didn't see as a big concession, because you could\nun-acknowledge it the next day. So, \"Yeah, I'll acknowledge it, and then we'll go and exchange.\" President Xi was gonna come\nover to the US for a visit, so they could sit together, and they wanted to do it\noutside the White House. And so we agreed on Mar-a-Lago, which I also thought was good, 'cause President Trump always\nfelt much more comfortable when he was hosting at his properties. And he just felt at home. And so he liked having people\nas his guests, he loved it. He always felt really\nrelaxed and it was great. So that was really what we did. Then the Chinese come over,\nvery much anticipated visit, and it was incredible. So they were supposed to\nsit together for 15 minutes, and they sat about an\nhour and a half together. And during that meeting,\nPresident Trump, said, \"Look, let's just set some ground\nrules to this relationship. Let's just not talk about Taiwan. Just don't do anything I\ndon't want it on the table. If it does, I'm gonna\nhave to do harsh things. I just don't want this to\nbe a problem for four years, we got bigger issues.\" They basically just, again, you notice four years\nof Trump administration, no Taiwan talk whatsoever,\nit was a non-issue. Started talking about the trade issues. They spent a lot of time on North Korea. President Trump was trying\nto get the perspective from President Xi about North\nKorea because that was, again, considered from Obama, the biggest national\nsecurity issue that we faced at the time. And, and they just had a\ngood feeling for each other. It also helped that,\nyou know, my wife and I, we actually had a Chinese\nnanny and teacher in our house, and our kids learned fluent Mandarin. And our daughter actually\nopened when President Xi and President Trump were together with Melania and with Madame Peng, is my daughter actually sang\nthem a couple of Chinese songs. And I thought that was a\nnice way to show, you know, we're tough, but we respect your culture. So Chinese have an incredible\nculture that goes back thousands of years. They're very proud in\nhow and how they do it. And I think that sign of\nrespect also set things off in a very warm way for\nPresident Trump to say, \"My granddaughter speaks Chinese, and we're showing you the respect,\" which I think is very important. And he did have respect for them. The next part about the visit, I mean, obviously, we had a\nlot of discussions on trade, but the part that was probably\nmost impactful to me was President Xi basically did\nan hour monologue at lunch where he just went through Chinese history from his perspective. And he talked about, with\nparticularly emphasis on kind of the treaty of unequals, and then 100 years of humiliation. And then you go through from\nMao all the way to today, and you had China coming back, and rising. And you could tell that he was, learned the lessons from the\npast, and was very committed to kind of seeing China go through. So that was a different time, right? So China today is different\nthan it was in 2017. In 2017, I remember\nPresident Xi was at Davos and he was vetted by all\nthe top business people in the world as the, you know, Donald Trump was the threat\nto the global world order. President Xi was the\nchampion of free trade, and the biggest champion\nof environmentalism, and fighting for climate change. And what occurred was President\nTrump came in and basically said like, \"I think China's not been\nfollowing the rules-based order.\" Took very, very drastic\napproaches with tariffs. Every time he would do the\ntariffs again, you know, I had Mnuchin, our treasury\nsector come to Vanka's house. If he does this, this is\ngonna crash the whole economy. I mean, and by the way, he believed it. I mean, these were things\nthat people were telling him would be very tough to do. You know, President Trump had a gentleman named Ambassador Lighthizer, Robert Lighthizer, he was\nreally the, tip of the spear on all of our, our trade negotiations. He worked very well as Secretary Mnuchin. We ended up increasing tariffs\nto numbers that hadn't even been thought could happen. So we did the first round of tariffs. Then, you know, the Chinese came back and\nretaliated very surgically trying to hit us in all the areas\nthat politically would've been difficult, and what Trump did\nwas, instead of backing down, he took some of the\nrevenue from the tariffs, gave it to the farmers and said, \"I know that this is\ngonna hurt your business, but I'm gonna make sure\nyou guys are made whole.\" And then he doubled down\nand basically went back at the Chinese with even more tariffs. So what we watched over a\nyear and a half was probably the biggest hand of poker\nthat was ever played. And it was an amazing\nexperience to be a part of it. And the role I played was\nreally working for Secretary Mnuchin and Ambassador Lighthizer as a back channel with the\nChinese to make sure we can just deescalate things and get to solutions in the best way possible. And so, anyways, it\nwas a fascinating time, but if you think about\nthe global awareness of the bad practices that China\nwas putting in place today versus what they were in 2016, I think one of President\nTrump's most successful policies was shifting the way the entire\nworld understood the threat of China and then putting in\nplace the beginning of a regime to try and rebalance the world\nso that we could have more economic parity. - So you mentioned to me the book, \"The Hundred-Year Marathon\"\nby Michael Pillsbury when we discussed China. And I've gotten a chance\nto read parts of it, and I'd highly recommend people read it, 'cause it's a definitely\nan eyeopening perspective. I don't know if I agree with all of it. I dunno if you agree with all of it, but it's certainly opens, it gives a very intense\nperspective on China. And you said it was\ninstructive to how you thought, how Donald Trump thought about China. Can you describe the\nmain thesis of the book, and maybe with the hopeful view how it's possible to have\na trajectory of these two superpowers working\ntogether in the 21st century versus fighting against each other? - Perfect, so it's a very, very big book, and I think it's a book\ndefinitely worth reading. Michael is tremendous. He speaks fluent Mandarin. So he spent a lot of time\nresearching to do the book. So I highly recommend it to everyone. And it was considered more of\na fringe perspective in 2016. But it really, I think came to represent\nthe underpinning of what the collective thought was\nof the Trump administration. And maybe you could argue\nthat it was even more cynical. The whole thesis of the book\nwas that China from 1949 to 2049 was working to reclaim\ntheir position as the global leader, right? So you had the Chinese empire. You know, one of the things, I dunno if it's from this\nbook or a different book that I read that spoke\nabout how in the late 1700s, basically the emperor of\nChina was offered some of the industrial capability from England, which was basically now becoming\nthe industrial revolution. And they said, \"No, we're fine. We're the great Chinese empire. We don't need any of these things. We're better than that.\" And by rejecting that, the\nrest of the world got stronger. China remained weaker. Then you had the opium wars. The Chinese had big opium\nproblems through all the trade back-and-forth. And then China from about\n1840 to to to 1940, 100 years, where they really, after\nall these treaties, were really second class a country. And so then you have the people's\nrevolution that comes in. And he talks about how China\nvery strategically is a very, very poor country, you know,\nwould fight their way back, and build brick by brick. And you know, he proffers\nin the book that Nixon didn't go to China and open China. It was China that actually went to Nixon, and was able to use Nixon\nin order to open up. And then they talk about how under Carter, they were able to get the US to contribute to a lot of their, they were able to kind of\nstart borrowing the US knowhow from our university\nsystems, from our medical, from our science, from our research. And the whole notion that\nwas the conventional thinking of American leaders was that the more we helped China advance,\nthe more they would become a free market economy. And it was a great market. The only difference was,\nwas that they weren't allowing us access. They were making our\ncompanies basically give them all of their technical knowledge. They were stealing our\nintellectual property, they were doing espionage to\nsteal a lot of the patents. They were just ignoring our patents, and they weren't\nfollowing any of the rules of international trade. Then they started becoming\nthe world's manufacturing hub. They basically came the\nworld's factory and then they started this whole initiative called the Belt and Road Initiative in order to start locking\nin their lines of trades. They were buying up all\nthe ports everywhere. They were building railways,\nthinking, \"How do we lock in our, distribution\nso that we can maintain the dominance as the\nworld's global factory?\" And so it was a brilliant long-term plan that they were doing. And by raising awareness,\nby putting the tariffs, Trump slowed them down a lot. The real question is, is if they actually did\nachieve this full objective of becoming the world dominant country, what they would've done with it, whether they would've\nbeen nefarious or not. I think from my perspective, even with some of the divisions\nand issues we have now in America, I still would rather an\nAmerican-led world order, than a Chinese-led world order. But the notion was, is that they were playing a\nvery zero sum game and really going to be the dominant\nleader in this new world order. So that really framed the perspective. And it wasn't necessarily, you know, and the Chinese were always fearing, \"Is Trump trying to stop our rise, right?\" And you have a great book\nalso by Graham Allison that he writes about. You know, are we destined\nfor war between us and China? And he goes through different\nhistorical times where you have a power and a rising superpower. And I think, you know, more than half the time\nit ends up leading to war. So the question is, is\nwhat's gonna happen here? And I do think that Trump's perspective, and this is my interpretation, because everything was\nalways tactical day-to-day. And you know, he was\nunpredictable to the Chinese, which they couldn't deal with. And he was unpredictable\neven to his team sometimes, because he was playing it day-by-day, and issue by issue and always\nchanging and adjusting, which is how an entrepreneur thinks. He respected the job they did\nby building their country. They moved 300 million\npeople out of poverty into the middle class. They did it at the expense\nof a lot of other countries throughout the world, especially America. But Trump says, \"Look, stupid\npoliticians made deals. I respect China for doing what they did. But what I wanna do is I\nwanna change the paradigm, so that for the next 20 years, we can maintain our advantage over them, we can maintain our competitive dynamic.\" And you know, his general view was that America\nis the best private sector in the world. We have a lot of the\nbest minds in the world, and if we could just have a\nlevel playing field with set rules, then America should\nbe able to outperform. And so that's really what\nwe were trying to do. We were trying to kind of get\nrid of some of their state subsidies, make them follow\nsome of these international rules of trade, and not allowing them to do\npredatory investments that then undercut different industries\nthat we had so that they can have global market dominance\nor monopolies on different industries and then have pricing power. But also, you know, geopolitical power. So like one of the examples\nthat people talk about now is China for the last 20 years was very advanced on seeing\nthis electrification trend. They went, they subsidized solar panels. A lot of the American solar panel players were put outta business. So now I think it's like 90\nplus percent of solar panels in the world are manufactured in China. Then all the rare earths that\nyou need in order to make these solar panels and to\nmake these electric vehicles. China's bought up most of\nthem and a lot of the refining capacities in China. So thinking through strategically\nhow do we create an even playing field so that we're\nnot at the mercy of them, and how you can have a a\nrules-based world order, that was really kind of the\nthought of what we were trying to work towards. - So there's this SNL skit\nwhere Jimmy Fallon plays you, and you're walking into the\nOval office, looking cool, wearing shades, and a\nbulletproof vest to the song \"Unbelievable\" by EMF. I dunno if you've seen\nit, but it's pretty epic. And then Trump says that\nyou've traveled the world representing the administration, but no one has ever heard you speak. So there's a lot of questions\nI can ask about that clip. But one of them is, can you introspect why you\nchoose this low key approach of kind of operating behind the scenes, and not speaking much to the\npublic, at least at the time. You've spoken a little bit more. And today, you've spoken\nfor a really long time, which I deeply appreciate. - No, it's been a pleasure to do this, and thank you for the opportunity to talk about these things. And so that was a really funny skit. And you know, it's funny, the thing I got made fun\nof the most for that was the wardrobe, and that came from after three months in the administration we were having dinner with all\nthe generals and they were saying, you know, updating\nus on the war with ISIS. And General Dunford\nsaid to me after, \"Look, the president can't come to see\nhow we're fighting this war, but I'd like to invite you to\ncome with me to Iraq and come see, and would you come with me?\" I said, \"You know what, that's great.\" I always learned in business\nthat you can't make decisions from just an ivory tower, you have to go to the front lines and see what's actually happening. So I said, \"No problem, I'd love to go.\" Meanwhile, two days\nbefore I'm about to go, the doc from the White House stops by my office and says, \"We need to get your blood type,\" I said, \"Why do you mean my blood type?\" He says \"You're going\nto an active war zone. I'm like, \"Okay, I guess\nI'll go to a war zone.\" I didn't really think\nthis thing fully through. So I get on the plane\nwith Dunford and we land in Iraq, and he looks like GI Joe. He's a great general. He is very, very well\nrespected in the military. And we go in, and we get\non Black Hawk helicopter, they said, you know, \"Today's a nice day. Let's take the, the sides off.\" And so I get on the plane\nand there's a guy, you know, military service officer who\nthen takes a machine gun, locks it into a thing, takes the bullets, puts them into the gun, and\nis sitting there saying, \"We're ready to go.\" And then I'm looking out\nand there's like three other helicopters with guys. One was an osprey with a guy buckled in, also with a machine gun looking out. We take off, and we're flying\nover Baghdad from the airport to the embassy. And as we're going, I'm sitting in an open air\nhelicopter with the chairman of the joint, chiefs of staff, guys with machine guns everywhere. - This is a new experience for you, you haven't experience previously? - I would say slightly. I mean, I was doing real\nestate like three months ago, you know, and now I'm flying over Iraq, and the chairman says, \"That's\nSaddam Hussein's palace.\" And I look down, there's like a big bomb\nright through the middle. Then you see the area with\nthe two swords in the hands. I'm saying to myself, like,\n\"How the hell did I get here?\" Like, what is happening? So meanwhile, we end up\ngoing to the front lines to be with the service,\nthe Iraqi military, which the US military\nis working closely with. And I had a meeting that night\nwith the president of Iraq. And so I wore, what do you wear to the\nfront lines in a battle zone, and also meet the president? So I put a sports jacket on, we land at the the front line, and they give me a bulletproof vest that says Kushner on it. I tape it, I put it on, I go out and I cover the\nN-E-R, so it just said, Kush. - Kush, yeah.\n- And, I went, and I didn't realize they\nwere taking pictures. - I think the picture looks pretty epic, you with sunglasses, I love it. - So anyway, so that was\nthe funny story behind that. And then actually my brother\nwas at a some society event in New York and he ran into Jimmy Fallon. So the two of 'em took a selfie\ntogether and Josh writes me, he says, \"Hanging out with my\nolder brother in New York.\" You know, I'm trying to explain to him what your voice sounds\nlike, so it was good. So that was a funny one. But I think just being behind\nthe scenes for me just gave me more maneuverability in the\nsense that, you know, again, it goes back to trust and people\nknowing that I wasn't gonna try to publicize the things\nthey were telling me. I think it just gave me more\nability to operate that way. And I also realized too, like, communicating is\na very important skill. Luckily in Washington, there's no shortage of\namazing communicators. I think there were a lot of\npeople who were much better at me than being communicators. So I was very happy that\nthey were willing to do it, 'cause it wasn't something\nthat I had a lot of experience with or necessarily I\nthought I was very good at. And so I kind of just did my job, and and just focused\non getting things done. - So let me, let me ask, you have a very interesting life. If you were to give\nadvice to young folks on how to have such an impactful\nlife, what would you say? Career and life, how to have a successful\ncareer and a successful life? - Number one is, I would say you just have to\nwork hard at everything you do. Number two, I would say\nnever stop learning, and always try to say\nyes more than you should. Go outta your comfort zone. And I think just, you gotta\nwork hard at everything you do. And, if you're gonna take something on, do it the best you can. You know, one of the lessons\nI write about in the book from my father was, I remember I was going for a\njob interview and he asked me, he says, \"Well, what time are you leaving to\nthe job interview is at nine o'clock?\" I said, \"I'll leave at eight o'clock.\" He says, \"Well, what if there's traffic?\" I said, \"Dad, I've done\nthis drive 1,000 times.\" Like there's never traffic. He said, \"What if there's an accident?\" I said, \"I can't control that.\" He said, \"Jared, the only excuse you ever\nhave for being late. He said \"You didn't leave early enough. And I just think it's\nsomething where if you wanna accomplish something, you know, a lot of people I hear they\ncomplain about what other people do or why it's hard or\nwhy it's impossible. And again, I say this as somebody\nwho's been so blessed with, with so many things in life, but you know, when I've had challenges or\nthings I've wanted to achieve, I just focus and say, \"What can I do?\" And I'll read everything\nI can get my hands on. I'll if I fail at one, the door\ncloses, I'll try the window. If the window closes,\nI'll try the chimney. If the chimney chose,\nI'll try to dig a tunnel. It's just, if you wanna\naccomplish something, you just have to go at it. And, you know, I think the\nmost important thing I'll say, Sorry, I'm kind of thinking\nmy way into this answer is just do the right thing,\nI think that's also right. And I saw that in my career.\nYou know, be good to people, be honest, do the right thing. And if you do that, I think long term, it does pay off, maybe\nnot in politics, but in the world at large it does. And my hope is in\npolitics it will as well. I wonder if you can comment\non your process of learning in general, 'cause you took on so many new, interesting problems and\napproached them with a first principles kind of approach. So what was your source of information? 'Cause you didn't seem to be\nlistening to the assumptions of the prior experts. You were just taking on the\nproblem in a very pragmatic perspective. How'd you learn about the Middle East? How did you learn about China? How did you learn about Mexico? Like all of these prison reform, all of this that you've\ntaken on and were extremely effective at. - It really started with\njust talking to people. I would try to reach out to\npeople who had been involved in different things and ask\nthem, you know, what they did, what they thought of the problem, who they thought was smart on it, what they read that helped\nthem get a better understanding why they think something had failed. And then I would just, you know, read voraciously on every topic. You know, Washington, it was\nharder to get advice from humans because I found humans\nhad this weird tendency to talk to the media. And so, you know, I talked to somebody and I'd\nask advice and then the next thing I know is the Washington\nPost would call and say, \"Jared's an idiot doesn't\nknow what he's doing, and he's even going to\nthis person to get advice.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I'm asking everyone.\" So books really became\nan amazing guide for me. Ivanka, she, she's an\nincredible researcher. She, she's just voracious. And so she gave me some of my\nbest books and some incredible advice as well, but that\nwas really the, the process. And then I think that was\nkind of the first stage. And then the second stage\nwas just constant iteration, and readjusting plan as you\ncontinue to get more learning. And one story I tell in\nthe book as well is that on my first trip to the Middle East, where I met with Mohammed bin Zayed who I spoke about earlier, the ruler of UAE, I spent\ntwo hours with him asking him questions and really going\nthrough the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the Israeli-Arab issue. And he said to me at the\nend of the meeting, he says, \"Jared, I think you're\ngonna make peace here in the Middle East.\" And I was shocked because I\nmean, first of all, he was, you know, at the time I think some, one of the most respected\nleaders in the region, somebody who I found to be\nvery wise and super thoughtful and experienced, and I said\nto him, \"Why do you say that?\" I was flattered, obviously,\nbut but not certain why he was saying that based on the\nfact that I didn't know what my plan was, I didn't\nknow what I was gonna do, and I had no pathway to make peace. And he said, \"Well, the US usually sends one of\nthree different kinds of people to come see me. He says, \"The first are people who\ncome and they fall asleep in meetings. He said, \"The second are people who come, and they basically read me notes, but have no ability to\ninteract on the message they're there to convey. And then the third have\nbeen people who have come to convince me to do things\nthat aren't in my interests.\" He says, \"You're the first person\nwho's ever come here, and has just asked questions. He says, \"Why? Why have you done that?\" I said, \"Because I figure, you know, this problem's been going\non for a long time.\" You live here, I'll be gone at some point. You're gonna have to live with\nthe consequences of whatever my work is, and the US has a lot of power. And my question is, what would you do if you were\nme and how would you approach this and help me think about it.\" And again, I wasn't gonna then take his\nplan and then execute it, but I thought it'd be very\nprovocative to understand from the people in the region and\ninstructive how they would use the resource and the power\nthat the US had to solve the problems that were having\nsignificant impact on their lives. - Yeah, there's a lot\nof power to the sort of the simplicity of that human\napproach where you're just listening. - Yeah. And one of my\nwishes for society as I leave government, you know, I was living on the upper East\nside in a very liberal echo chamber. I then traveled the country. I met so many people who I\nnever would've met otherwise. On the conservative side,\non the independent side, on so many different issues,\nI think that people benefit. If you have such a strong\npoint of view, I would follow, you know, the John Stewart Mill marketplace\nof ideas and find people who disagree with you and\ndon't call them names, don't say they're a bad person. Say, \"I wanna understand why\nyou feel the way you do. Let's have conversations in this country.\" And I think that that's probably\ngonna be our best way to work through the issues\nthat we have currently. - When you zoom out and look at the 21st century from a human history perspective, across\nthe timescale of many decades, maybe centuries, what gives you hope\nabout human civilization? Everything you've seen,\nyou've traveled the world, you've talked to some of the\nmost powerful and influential people, and you look at the future, what gives you hope about\nthis little planet of ours? What gives me the most hope\nis that anything's possible. If there's one lesson\nthat I took from my time in government. It's that people coming\ntogether to try to make tomorrow different than yesterday can succeed. And if the right people in\nthe right places focus on the right ideas, I think the advancement that\nwe can have for human history and for society can be tremendous. And I think that right now I\nsee we're at a place in society where there's a lot of what\nI call squabbles between countries, which are really\nman versus man issues. And those are as old as time, right? You know, we've been\nfighting about borders or religion or, you know, or, or who wronged somebody\n100 or 1,000 years ago. And these are what I\ncall more tribal battles. But I do think that as we\nadvance with artificial intelligence, as energy becomes cheaper and\nit's more readily available, I think we're gonna have\nmassive industrialization. I think we're gonna have\nmassive advancement. I think in medical and science, we're gonna have cures for diseases. We have the potential in 10, 20 years from now to\nenter a dawn for humanity. That could be incredible. We\ncould become multi-planetary. We can, we can explore\nthe wonders of the world. We can find things we didn't know. So I think that if, if we, we put our energy towards\nfinding these advancements that will improve the lives of,\nof everyone on this planet, instead of figuring out ways\nto have these tensions between us, that, for me is the most optimistic\ncase for what's possible. And the reason why I believe\nit's possible is because somebody with no experience, somebody who all I really\nhad was, was the faith of a leader. And I had the the courage to try. And I went out there with other\npeople and we took on some of the most hopeless, impossible\nproblems and we succeeded. And if we were able to do that, then everyone else should\nbe able to do that as well. - Well, Jared, thank you for\nhaving the courage to try. Thank you for your\nfriendship, for your kindness, most importantly for your\nbook recommendations. And thank you for talking today. This was fascinating eye opening. I hope to have many more\nconversations like this. - Thank you very much, Lex. - Thank you for listening to\nthis conversation with Jared Kushner.
