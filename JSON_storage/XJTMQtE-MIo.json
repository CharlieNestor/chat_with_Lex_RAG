      "text": "- The following is a conversation with Kevin Spacey, a\ntwo-time Oscar winning actor who has starred in \"Se7en,\"\n\"The Usual Suspects,\" \"American Beauty\" and \"House of Cards.\" He is one of the greatest actors ever, creating haunting\nperformances of characters who often embody the dark\nside of human nature. Seven years ago, he was\ncut from \"House of Cards\" and canceled by Hollywood and the world when Anthony Rapp made an allegation that Kevin Spacey sexually\nabused him in 1986. Anthony Rapp then filed a civil\nlawsuit seeking $40 million. In this trial and all civil and criminal trials that\nfollowed, Kevin was acquitted. He has never been found guilty nor liable in the court of law. In this conversation, Kevin makes clear what he did and what he didn't do. I also encourage you to\nlisten to Kevin's Dan Wootton and Alison Pearson interviews\nfor additional details and responses to the allegations. As an aside, let me say that one of the principles I operate under for this podcast and in life is that I will talk with everyone, with empathy and with backbone. For each guest, I hope to\nexplore their life's work, life story and what and how they think and do so honestly and fully. The good, the bad, and the ugly, the brilliance and the flaws. I won't whitewash their sins, but I won't reduce them to\na worse possible caricature of their sins either. The latter is what the mass hysteria of internet mobs too\noften does, often rushing to a final judgment\nbefore the facts are in. I will try to do better than that, to respect due process\nin service of the truth. And I hope to have the courage\nto always think independently and to speak honestly from\nthe heart, even when the eyes of the outrage mob are on me. Again, my goal is to\nunderstand human beings at their best and at their worst. And the hope is such understanding leads to more compassion and\nwisdom in the world. I will make mistakes and when I do, I will\nwork hard to improve. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description and now, dear friends,\nhere's Kevin Spacey."

      "text": "You played a serial killer\nin the movie \"Se7en.\" Your performance was one of, if not the greatest portrayal\nof a murderer on screen ever. What was your process of becoming him, John Doe, the serial killer? - The truth is, I didn't get the part. I had been in Los Angeles\nmaking a couple of films, \"Swimming with Sharks\"\nand \"Usual Suspects,\" and then I did a film called \"Outbreak\" that Morgan Freeman was in. And I went to audition for David Fincher in probably late November of '94. And I auditioned for this\npart and didn't get it and I went back to New York. And I think they started\nshooting like December 12th. And I'm in New York, I'm back in my, I have a wonderful apartment\non West 12th Street and my mom has come to visit for Christmas and it's December 23rd and it's like seven o'clock\nat night and my phone rings and it's Arnold Kopelson,\nwho's the producer of \"Se7en.\" And he's very jovial\nand he's very friendly and he says, \"How you doing?\" And I said, \"Fine.\" And he said, \"Listen, do you remember that film you came in for, Se7en?\" And I said, \"Yeah, absolutely.\" He goes, \"Well, turns out\nthat we hired an actor and we started shooting and then yesterday David fired him. And David would like you\nto get on a plane on Sunday and come to Los Angeles and\nstart shooting on Tuesday.\" And I was like, \"Okay, would it be I imposing\nto say, can I read it again? 'Cause it's been a while\nnow and I'd like to...\" So they sent a script over, I read the script that night. I thought about it and I had this feeling, I can't even quite describe it, but I had this feeling that it would be really good if I didn't take billing in the film. And the reason I felt that was because I knew that by the\ntime this film would come out, it would be the last\none of the three movies that I just shot, the fourth one. And if any of those films\nbroke through or did well, if it was gonna be Brad\nPitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey, and you don't show up for\nthe first 25, 30, 40 minutes, people are gonna figure\nout who you're playing. - So people would know that you play the serial\nkiller in the movie and serial killer shows\nup like more than halfway through the movie.\n- Very late in the movie. - When we say billing,\nit's like the posters, the VHS cover and everything. You're gone. You're not there. - Not there. And so New Line Cinema\ntold me to go fuck myself, that they absolutely could use my picture and my image, blah, blah. And this became a little bit of a, I'd say 24 hour conversation. And it was Fincher who said, \"I actually think this\nis a really cool idea.\" So the compromise was,\nI'm the first credit at the end of the movie\nwhen the credits start."

      "section": "David Fincher",
      "text": "So I got on a plane on that\nSunday and I flew to Los Angeles and I went into where they were shooting, and I went into the makeup room\nand David Fincher was there, and we were talking\nabout what should I do, how should I look. And I just had my hair\nshort for \"Outbreak\" 'cause I was playing a military character and I just looked at the hairdresser and I said, \"Do you have a razor?\" And Fincher went, \"Are you kidding?\" And I said, \"No.\" He goes, \"If you shave your\nhead, I'll shave mine.\" So we both shaved our heads. And then I started shooting the next day. So my long-winded answer\nto your question is that I didn't have that\nmuch time to think about how to build that character. What I think in the end, Fincher was able to do so brilliantly with such terror, was\nto set the audience up to meet this character. - I think the last scene, the ending scene and the car ride leading up to it, where it's mostly on you in conversation with Morgan\nFreeman and Brad Pitt, it's one of the greatest\nscenes in film history. So people who somehow\ndidn't see the movie, there's these five murders that happened that are inspired by five\nof the seven deadly sins and the ending scene is inspired, represents the last two deadly sins. And there's this calm subtlety about you in your performance\nthat's just terrifying. Maybe in contrast with\nBrad Pitt's performance, that's also really strong, but that in the contrast\nis the terrifying sense that you get in the audience that builds up to the twist at the end, or the surprise at the end with the famous, \"What's in\nthe box,\" from Brad Pitt. That is Brad Pitt's\ncharacter's wife, her head. - Yeah, I can really only tell you that while we were shooting\nthat scene in the car, while we were out in the desert, in that place where all\nthose electrical wires were, David just kept saying, \"Less, do less.\" And I just tried to. I mean, I remember he kept saying to me, \"Remember, you are in control. Like you are going to win. And knowing that should allow you to have tremendous confidence.\" And I just followed that lead. And I just think it's the kind of film that so many of the elements that had been at work from the beginning of the movie in terms of its style, in terms of how he built this terror, in terms of how he built for the audience, a sense\nof this person being one of the scariest people that\nhe might ever encounter, it really allowed me to be able\nto not have to do that much, just say the words and mean them. And I think it also, it's an example of what makes tragedy so difficult. I mean, you know, very often tragedy is people operating without enough information. They don't have all the facts. Romeo and Juliet, they\ndon't have all the facts. They don't know what\nwe know as an audience. And so in the end, whether Brad Pitt's character\nends up shooting John Doe or turning the gun on himself, which was a discussion, I\nmean, there were a number of alternative endings that were discussed nothing ends up being tied\nup in a nice little bow. It is complicated and shows how nobody wins in the end when you're not operating\nwith all the information. - When you say, \"Say the\nwords and mean them,\" what does \"mean them\" mean? - I've been very fortunate to be directed by Fincher a couple of times, And he would say to me sometimes, \"I don't believe a thing that\nis coming out of your mouth. Shall we try it again?\" And you go, \"Okay, yeah,\nwe can try it again.\" And sometimes he'll do a take and then you'll look to see if he has any added genius to hand you. And he just goes, \"Let's do it again, and then let's do it again.\" And sometimes I say this in all humility, he's literally trying to\nbeat the acting out of you. And by continually saying, \"Do it again, do it again, do it again\" and not giving you any specifics, he is systematically shredding you of all pretense of all, you know... 'Cause look, very often,\nyou know, actors, we come in on the set and we've\nthought about the scene and we've worked out, you\nknow, I've got this prop and I'm gonna do this thing with a can, you know, all these things all the tea, I'm gonna do a thing with the thing. And David is the kind of director where he just wants you to\nstop adding all that crap and just say the words and say\nthem quickly and mean them. And it takes a while to get to that place. I'll tell you a story. This is a story I just love because it's in the exactly\nthe same wheelhouse. So Jack Lemmon's first\nmovie was a film called \"It Should Happen To You,\" and it was directed by George Cukor. And Jack tells this story, and it was just an\nincredibly charming story to hear Jack tell. He said, \"So I'm doing his picture and let me tell you, this\nis a terrific part for me. And I'm doing a scene,\nit's on my first day, it's my first day, and\nit's a terrific scene.\" And he goes, \"We do the first take and George Cukor comes up to me and he says, 'Jack.\" I said, 'Yeah.' He said, 'Let's do another one, but just do a little less in this one.'\" And Jack said, \"A little less? A little less than what I just did?\" He said, \"Yeah, just a little less.\" So he goes, \"We do another take.\" And I think, \"Boy, that was it. I mean, let's just go home.\" And Cukor walked up to him. He said, \"Jack, let's do\nanother one this time, just a little bit less.\" And Jack said, \"Less than\nwhat I just did now?\" He said, \"Yeah, just a little bit less.\" He goes, \"Oh, okay.\" So he did another take and Cukor came up and he said, \"Jack,\njust a little bit less.\" And Jack said, \"A little\nless than what I just did?\" He said, \"Yes.\" He goes, \"Well, if I do any\nless, I'm not gonna be acting.\" And Cukor said, \"Exactly, Jack exactly.\" - I mean, I guess what you're saying is\nit's extremely difficult to get to the bottom of a little less because the power, if we\njust stick even on \"Se7en\""

      "text": "of your performances in\nthe tiniest of subtleties, like when you say, \"Oh, you didn't know,\" and you turn your head a little bit and a little bit like\nlittle bit maybe a glimmer of a smile appears in your face. That's subtlety, that's less, that's hard to get to, I suppose. - Yeah and also because\nI so well remember, I think the work that Brad did and also Morgan did in that scene, but the work that Brad had\nto do, where he had to go. I remember rehearsing with\nhim as we were all staying at this little hotel nearby that location and we rehearsed the night before we started shooting that sequence. And, I mean, it was just incredible to see the levels of emotions\nhe had to go through, and then the decision of, what do I do? Because if I do what he\nwants me to do, then he wins. But if I don't do it, then what kind of a man, husband am I? I just thought he did\nreally incredible work. So it was also not easy to not react to the power of what\nhe was throwing at me. I just thought it was a\nreally extraordinary scene. - So what's it like being in that scene? So it's you, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Brad Pitt is going over the top just having\na mental breakdown and is weighing these extremely\ndifficult moral choices, as you're saying, but he's like screaming and in pain and tormented while\nyou're very subtly smiling. - In terms of the writing and in terms of what the\ncharacters had to do, it was incredible culmination of how this character could manipulate in the way that he did and in the end, succeed. - You mentioned Fincher\nlikes to do a lot of takes. That's the famous thing\nabout David Fincher. So what are the pros and cons of that? I think I read that he\ndoes some crazy amount. He averages 25 to 65 takes and most directors do less than 10, so. - Yeah, sometimes it's timing. Sometimes it's literally\nhe has a stopwatch and he's timing how\nlong a scene is taking. And then he'll say, \"You need to take a\nminute off this scene.\" \"Like a minute?\" \"Yeah, a minute off this scene. I want it to move like this. So let's pick up the pace. Let's see if we can take a minute off.\" - Why the speed? Why say fast is the important\nthing for him, you think? - I think because\nFincher hates indulgence, and he wants people to talk\nthe way they do in life, which is, you know, we don't take big dramatic pauses, you know, before we speak. We speak, we say what we want. - And I guess actors\nlike the dramatic pauses and the indulge in the dramatic. - We didn't always like\nthe dramatic pauses. I mean, look, you go back, any student of acting, you\ngo back to the thirties and the forties, fifties, the speed at which actors spoke,\nnot just in the comedies, which of course, you know, you look at any Preston Sturges movie, and it's incredible how\nfast people are talking and how funny things are\nwhen they happen that fast. But then, you know, acting styles changed. We got into a different kind of thing in the late fifties and sixties and, you know, a lot of\nactors are feeling it, which is, I'm not saying it's\na bad thing, it's just that if you want to keep an audience\nengaged as Fincher does and I believe successfully\ndoes in all of his work, pace, timing, movement, clarity, speed are admirable to achieve. - In all of that, he wants the actor to be as natural as possible to strip away all the bullshit\nof acting and become human. - Look, I've been lucky\nwith other directors. Sam Mendes is similar. I remember when I walked in\nto maybe the first rehearsal for \"Richard III\" that we were doing, and I had brought with\nme a canopy of ailments that my Richard was going to suffer from. And Sam, you know,\neventually whittled it down to like three, \"Like maybe your arm and maybe your leg but let's get rid of the other 10 things that you brought into the room,\" because, you know, I was so excited to, you know, capture this character. So, you know, very often, Trevor Nunn is this way, a lot of wonderful\ndirectors I've worked with, they're really good at\nhelping you trim and edit."

      "text": "- David Fincher said about you, he was talking in general, I think, but also specifically in the\nmoment of \"House of Cards,\" said that you have exceptional\nskill, both as an actor and as a performer, which he\nsays are different things. So he defines the former\nas dramatization of a text and the latter as the\nseduction of an audience. Do you see wisdom in that distinction? And what does it take to\ndo both, the dramatization of a text and the\nseduction of an audience? - Those are two very\ninteresting descriptions. I guess, when I think performer, I tend to think entertaining. I tend to think comedy. I tend to think winning over an audience. I tend to think there's something about that quality of wanting to\nhave people enjoy themselves. And when you saddle that against what maybe he means as an actor, which is more dramatic\nor more text driven... Look, I've always believed that my job, not every actor feels this way, but my job, the way that\nI've looked at it, is that my job is to serve the writing. And that if I serve the writing, I will in a sense serve myself, because I'll be in the right world, I'll be in the right context, I'll be in the right style. I'll have embraced what a director's... You know, it's not my painting, it's someone else's painting. I'm a series of colors in\nsomeone else's painting. And the barometer for\nme has always been that when people stop me and talk to me about a\ncharacter I've played and reference their name\nas if they actually exist, that's when I feel like I've\ngotten close to doing my job. - Yeah, one of the challenges for me in this conversation is remembering that your name is Kevin, not Frank or John or any of these characters, because they live deeply in the psyche. - To me, that's the greatest compliment for me as an actor. I love being able to go. I mean, when I think about performers who inspire me, and I remember when I was young and I was introduced to Spencer Tracy, Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn, I believed who they were. I knew nothing about them. They were just these\nextraordinary characters doing this extraordinary stuff. And then I think more\nrecently contemporary, when I think of the work that\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman did and Heath Ledger and people that when I think about what they could be doing,\nwhat they could do, what they would've done\nhad they stayed with us. I'm so excited when I go into a cinema or I go into a play and I completely am taken to someplace that I believe exists and\ncharacters that become real. - And those characters become\nlike lifelong companions. Like for me, they travel with you. And even if it's the darkest aspects of human nature, they're always there. I feel like I almost met them and gotten to know them and gotten to become like\nfriends with them almost. Hannibal Lecter or Forrest Gump, I mean, I feel like I'm like\nbest friends with Forrest Gump. I know the guy and I guess he's played\nby some guy named Tom, but like Forrest Gump is\nthe guy I'm friends with. And I think that everybody feels like that when they're in the audience\nwith great characters. They just kind of, become\npart of you in some way, the good, the bad, and the ugly of them. - One of the things that I feel that I try to do in my work is when I read something for the first time when I read a script or play, and I am absolutely devastated by it. It is the most extraordinary,\nthe most beautiful, the most life-affirming or terrifying, it's then a process weirdly\nof working backwards because I wanna work in such a way that that's the experience\nI give to the audience when they first see it, that they have the experience\nI had when I read it. I remember that there's been\ntimes in the creative process when something was pointed out to me or something was... I remember I was doing a play and I was having this really tough time with one of the last scenes in the play and I just couldn't figure it out and I was in rehearsal and although we had a\ndirector in that play, I called another, a friend\nof mine who was also director and I had him come over. And I said, \"Look, this scene,\nI'm just having the toughest, I cannot seem to crack this scene.\" And so we read it\nthrough a couple of times and then this wonderful\ndirector named John Swanbeck who would eventually direct me in a film called \"The Big\nKahuna,\" but this is before that. He said to me the most incredible thing. He just said, \"All right,\nwhat's the last line you have in this scene before you\nfall over and fall asleep?\" And I said, \"The last line is, 'That last drink, the old KO.'\" And he went, \"Okay, I\nwant you to think about what that line actually means\nand then work backwards.\" And so he left and I sort of was left with this, \"What? Like, what does that mean? How am I supposed to?\" And then like a couple of days went by, a couple of days went by and I\nthought, okay, so I see that, what does that line actually mean? \"Well, that last drink, the old KO.\" KO is knockout, which is a boxing term. It's the only boxing term\nthe writer uses in the play. And then I went back and I realized my friend was so smart and so incredible to, you know, said, \"Ask a question you haven't\nthought of asking yet.\" I realized that the playwright\nwrote the last round, the eighth round between\nthese two brothers and it was a fight, physical\nas well as emotional. And when I brought that\ninto the rehearsal room to the directors doing that\nplay, he liked that idea and we staged that scene as\nif it was the eighth round, although audience\nwouldn't have known that. But just what I loved about that was that somebody said to me,\n\"Ask yourself a question you haven't asked yourself yet. What does that line mean\nand then work backwards.\" - What is that like a catalyst for thinking deeply about what is magical about this play,\nthis story, this narrative? That's what that is. Like thinking backwards,\nthat's what that does. - Yeah, but also because\nit's this incredible, why didn't I think to\nask that question myself? That's what you have directors for. That's why you have, you know, so many places where ideas can come from, but that just illustrates that even though in my brain I go, I always\nlike to work backwards, I missed it in that one, and I'm very grateful to my friend for having pushed me into being able to realize what that meant. - To ask the interesting question."

      "text": "I like the poetry and the humility of, \"I'm just a series of colors\nin someone else's painting.\" That was a good line. That said, you've talked\nabout improvisation. You said that it's all about the ability to do it again and again and again, and yet never make it the same. And you also just said that you're trying to stay true to the text. So where's the room for the improvisation that it's never the same? - Well, there's two slightly\ndifferent contexts, I think. One is in the rehearsal room, improvisation could be a wonderful device. I mean, Sam Mendes for\nexample, he'll start a scene and he does this wonderful thing. He brings rugs and he\nbrings chairs and sofas in and he says, \"Well, let's\nput two chairs here and here. You guys, let's start in these chairs far apart from each other. Let's see what happens with the scene if you're that far apart.\" And so we'll do the scene that way. And then he goes, \"Okay,\nlet's bring a rug in and let's bring these chairs much closer and let's see what happens if the space between you is...\" And so then you try it that way. And then, you know, it's a little harder in Shakespeare improv, but in any situation where you wanna try and see where could a scene go. Where would the scene go if\nI didn't make that choice? Where would the scene go\nif I made this choice? Where would the scene\ngo if I didn't say that or I said something else? So that's how improv can\nbe a valuable process to learn about limits and boundaries and what's going on with a character that somehow you discover in trying something\nthat isn't on the page. Then there's the different thing, which is the trying to make it fresh and trying to make it new and that is really a reference to theater. I'll put it to you this way. Anybody loves sports, right? So you go and you watch on a pitch, you watch a tennis game,\nyou watch basketball, you watch football. Yeah, the rules are the same, but it's a different game\nevery time you're out on that court or on that field. It's no different in theater. Yes, it's the same lines,\nmaybe even blocking is similar, but what's different is attack, intention, how you are growing in a role and watching your fellow\nactors grow in theirs and how every night it's a new audience and they're reacting differently. And literally, where you can go from week one of performances in a play to week 12 is extraordinary. And the difference between\ntheater and film is that no matter how good\nsomeone might think you are in a movie, you'll never\nbe any better, it's frozen. Whereas I can be better tomorrow\nnight than I was tonight. I can be better in a\nweek than I was tonight. It is a living, breathing,\nshifting, changing, growing thing every single day. - But also in theater,\nthere's no safety net. If you fuck it up, everybody\ngets to see you do that. - And if you start giggling\non stage, everyone gets to see you do that too,\nwhich I am very guilty of. - I mean, there is something of a seduction of an audience in theater even more intense than there is when you're talking about film. I got a chance to watch the documentary \"Now in the Wings on a World Stage,\" which is behind the scenes of, you mentioned you teaming\nup with Sam Mendes in 2011 to stage \"Richard III,\" a\nplay by William Shakespeare. I was also surprised to learn you haven't\nreally done Shakespeare, or at least you said that in the movie, but there's a lot of interesting\nbehind-the-scenes stuff there. First of all, the comradery of everybody, how like the bond theater creates, especially when you're traveling. But another interesting\nthing you mentioned with the chairs of Sam Mendes\ntrying different stuff, it seemed like everybody was\nreally open to trying stuff, embarrassing themselves,\ntaking risks, all of that. I suppose that's part\nof acting in general, but theater especially. Just take risks, it's okay to embarrass\nthe shit outta yourself including the director. - And it's also because\nyou become a family. You know, it's unlike a movie where, you know, I might have a scene with so and so on this day and then another scene with\nthem in a week and a half and then that's the only scenes we have in the whole movie together. Every single day when you\nshow up in the rehearsal room, it's the whole company. You're all up for it every day. You're learning, you're\ngrowing, you're trying and there is an incredible\ntrust that happens. And I was of course fortunate that some of the things I learned and\nobserved about being a part of that family, being\nincluded in that family and being a part of creating\nthat family, I was able to observe from people like Jack Lemmon who led many companies that\nI was fortunate to work in and be a part of. - There's also a sad moment where at the end everybody\nis really sad to say goodbye 'cause you do form a\nfamily and then it's over. I guess somebody said that\nthat's just part of theater. It's like, I mean, there's\na kind of assumed goodbye and that this is it. - Yeah and also there are sometimes when like six months later\nI'll wake up in the middle of the night and I'll go, ah,\nthat's how to play that scene. Oh God, I just finally\nfigured it out. (laughs) - So maybe you could speak\na little bit more to that. What's the difference between film acting and live theater acting? - I don't really think there is any. I think there's just, you eventually learn\nabout yourself on film. You know, when I first\ndid like my first episode of \"The Equalizer,\" you know, it's horrible. It's just so bad. But I didn't know that about myself. So slowly begin to learn about yourself but I think good acting is good acting and I think that, you know, if a camera's right here, you know that your front row is also your back row. You don't have to do so much. There is in theater, a\nparticular kind of energy, almost like an athlete\nthat you have to have, vocally to be able to get\nup seven performances a week and never lose your voice and always be there and always be alive and always be doing the best work you can that you just don't require in film. You know, you don't have to have the same, it just doesn't require\nthe same kind of stamina that doing a play does. - It just feels like\nalso in theater you have to become the character more intensely because you can't take a break, you can't take a bathroom break, and you're like, on stage, there's no, this is you. - Yeah but you have no\nidea what's going on stage with the actors. I mean, I have literally\nlaughed through speeches that I had to give because my fellow actors were\nputting carrots up their nose or broccoli in their ears or doing whatever they were\ndoing to make me laugh. - So they're just having fun? - They're having the time of their life. And by the way, Judi Dench\nis the worst giggler of all. I mean, they had to bring\nthe curtain down on her and Maggie Smith because\nthey were laughing so hard they could not continue the play. - So even when you're doing\nlike a dramatic monologue, they're still fucking with you. - They're still fucking. (laughs) - Okay, that's great. Yeah, that's good to know."

      "text": "You also said an interesting line that improvisation helps you\nlearn about the character. Can you explain that? So like, through maybe playing\nwith the different ways of saying the words or the different ways to bring the words to life, you\nget to learn about yourself, about the character you're playing. - It can be helpful but improv is... I'm such a big believer in the writing and in serving the writing and doing the words the writer wrote, that improv for me, unless\nyou're just doing like comedy and you know, like, I mean I love improv in comedy, it's brilliant. So much fun to watch people just come up with something right there. But, you know, that's where\nyou're looking for laughs and you're specifically in a little scene that's being created. But I think improv has had value, but I have not experienced\nit as much in doing plays as I have sometimes in doing film where you'll start off rehearsing and a director may say, \"Let's just go off book\nand see what happens.\" And I've had moments in film\nwhere someone went off book and it was terrifying. There was a scene I had\nin \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" where the character I play\nhas fucked something up. He's just screwed something\nup and Pacino is livid. And so we had the scene\nwhere Al is walking like this and the camera is moving with him and he is shoeing me a new asshole. And in the middle of the take, Al starts talking about me. \"Oh Kevin, you don't think\nwe know how you got this job? You don't think we know whose\ndick you've been sucking on to get this part in this movie?\" And now, I'm literally like, I don't know what the hell is happening,\nbut I'm reacting. We got to the end of that take. Al walked up to me and he\nwent, \"Oh, that was so good. Oh my God, that was so good. Just so you know, the sound,\nI asked them not to record, so you have no dialogue so it's just me. Oh, that was so good. You look like a car wreck.\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" And it was actually an\nincredibly generous thing that he gave me so that I would react. - Oh wow. Did they use that shot? because you were in the shot?\n- That's the take. It was my closeup. And yeah, that's the take. - That was an intense scene. I mean, what was it like, if we can just linger on that, just that intense scene with Al Pacino? - Well, he's the reason I got the movie. A lot of people might think\nbecause Jack was in the film, that he had something to do with it. But actually I was doing a play called \"Lost in Yonkers\" on Broadway. And we had the same dresser\nwho worked with him, a girl named Laura who was\nwonderful, Laura Beatty. And she told Al that he\nshould come and see this play because she wanted to see me in this play. I was playing this gangster,\nfun, fun, fun part."

      "text": "So I didn't know Pacino came\non some night and saw this play and then like three days\nlater, I got a call to come in and audition for this\n\"Glengarry Glen Ross,\" which of course I knew as\na play, David Mamet's play. And then I auditioned,\nJamie Foley was the director who would eventually direct a bunch of \"House of Cards,\" wonderful guy. And I got the part. Well, I didn't quite get the part. They were gonna bring together the actors that they thought they were\ngonna give the parts to on a Saturday at Al's office. And they asked me if I would\ncome and do a read through and I said, \"Who's gonna be there?\" And they said, well, so and\nso and so and so and so, and Jack Lemmon is flying in. And I said, \"Don't tell Mr. Lemmon that I'm doing the read through. Is that possible?\" And they were like, \"Sure.\" So I'll never forget this. Jack was sitting in a chair in Pacino's office doing the\nNew York Times crossword puzzle as he did every day like this. And I walked in the door and\nhe went, \"Oh, Jesus Christ. Is it possible you could\nget a job without me? Jesus Christ, I'm so tired\nof holding up your end of it. Oh my God, Jesus.\" So I got the job job because of Al Pacino. And, you know, it was really\none of the first major roles that I ever had in a film and, you know, to be\nworking with that group. - Yeah, that's like one of the\ngreatest ensemble cast ever. We got Al Pacino, Jack\nLemmon, Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris,\nyou, Jonathan Pryce. It's just incredible. And I have to say, I mean\nmaybe you can comment, you've talked about how much of a mentor and a friend Jack Lemmon has been. That's one of his greatest\nperformances ever. - Ever. - You have a scene at the end of the movie with him that was really powerful. It's like firing on all cylinders. You're playing disdain to perfection and he's playing\ndesperation to perfection. What a scene. What was that like? just like at the top of\nyour game, the two of you? - Well, by that time we had done \"Long Day's Journey Into\nNight\" in the theater. We'd done a mini series called \"The Murder of Mary Phagan\" on NBC. We'd done a film called \"Dad\" that Gary David Goldberg\ndirected with Ted Danson. So this was the fourth time\nwe were working together and we knew each other. He'd become my father figure. And I don't know if you know that I originally met Jack Lemmon when I was very, very young. He was doing a production\nat the Mark Taper Forum of a Sean O'Casey play\ncalled \"Juno and The Paycock\" with Walter Matthau and Maureen Stapleton. And on a Saturday, in December of 1974, my junior high school drama\nclass went to a workshop. It was called How to Audition. And we did this workshop, many schools in southern\nCalifornia were part of this drama association so we got these incredible experiences of being able to go see\nprofessional productions and be involved in these\nworkshops or festivals. So I had to get up and do a monologue in front of Mr. Lemmon\nwhen I was 13 years old. And he walked up to me at the end of that and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said, \"That was\njust actually terrific.\" He said, \"No, I mean, everything\nI've been talking about, you just did. Yeah, what what's your name?\" I said, \"Kevin.\" He said, \"Well, lemme tell you something, when you get finished with high school, I'm sure you're gonna\ngo on and do theater, you should go to New York and you should study to be an actor 'cause this is what you're\nmeant to do with your life.\" - And he was like an idol and 12 years later, I\nread in the New York Times that he was coming to\nBroadway to do this production of a \"Long Day's Journey Into\nNight,\" a year and some months after I read this article and I was like, I'm gonna\nplay Jamie in that production. And I then, with a lot of opposition, because the casting directors\ndidn't wanna see me. They said that the director, Jonathan Miller wanted movie\nactors to play the two sons. And ultimately, I found out that Jonathan Miller,\nthe director, was coming to New York to do a series of\nlectures at Alice Tully Hall. And I went to try to figure\nout how I could maybe meet him. And I was sitting in\nthat theater listening to this incredible lecture he was doing and sitting next to me\nwas an elderly woman, and I mean elderly, 80 something, and she was asleep, but sticking out of her handbag, which was on the floor was a invitation to a cocktail reception in\nhonor of Dr. Jonathan Miller. And so I thought, you know, she's tired, she's probably gonna go home. So I took that and walked\ninto this cocktail reception and ultimately went over to Dr. Miller, who was incredibly kind and said, \"Sit down now. I'm always very curious what brings young people to my lectures.\" And I said to him, \"Eugene\nO'Neill brought me here.\" And he was like, \"What? I've\nalways wanted to meet him. Where is he?\" And I told him that I'd\nbeen trying for seven months to get an audition for\na Long Day's Journey and that his American cast\ndirectors were telling my agents that he wanted big American movie stars. And at that moment he turned and he saw one of those casting directors who was there that night, because I knew he was gonna be in New York starting auditions that week and she was staring daggers\nat me and he just got it. And he said, \"Someone have a pen?\" And he took the little\npaper, started writing. He said, \"Listen, Kevin,\nthere are many situations in which casting directors\nhave a lot of say and a lot of power and a lot of leverage and then there are other situations where they just take director's messages and on this one they're\ntaking my messages. This is where I'm staying. Make sure your people get to me. We start auditions on Thursday.\" And on Thursday, I had an opportunity to come in and audition for this play that I've been working on and preparing. And at the end of it, I did four scenes. At the end of it, he said to me that unless someone else came in and blew him against the\nwall, like I had just done as far as he was concerned,\nI pretty much had the part but I couldn't tell my agents that yet 'cause I had to come back\nand read with Mr. Lemmon. And so three months later in August of 1985, I\nfound myself in a room with Jack Lemmon again at 890 Broadway, which is where they rehearsed\na lot of the Broadway plays and we did four scenes together. And I was toppling over\nhim, I was pushing him, I was relentless. And I'll never forget, at the end of that, Lemmon came over to me, he\nput his hand on my shoulder and he said, \"That was\na touch of terrific. I never thought we'd find the rotten kid, but Jesus Christ, what the hell was that?\" And I ended up spending the next year of my life with that man. - So it turns out he was right. - Yeah. - This world works in mysterious ways. It also speaks to the fact of the power of somebody you look up to\ngiving words of encouragement 'cause those can just reverberate\nthrough your whole life and just like make the path clear. - We used to joke that\nif every contract came with a Jack Lemmon clause, it would be a more beautiful world. - Beautifully said. Jack Lemmon is one of\nthe greatest actors ever. What do you think makes him so damn good? - Wow. I think he truly set out in his life to accomplish what his father\nsaid to him on his deathbed. His father was by the way,\ncalled the Donut King in Boston and not in the entertainment\nbusiness at all. He literally owned a donut company. And when he was passing away, Jack said, \"The last thing\nmy father said to me was, 'Go out there and spread\na little sunshine.'\" And I truly think that's\nwhat Jack loved to do. I remember this and I don't know if this will answer your question, but I think it's revealing\nabout what he's able to do and what he was able to do and how that ultimately\ninfluenced what I was able to do."

      "section": "American Beauty",
      "text": "Sam Mendes had never directed a film before \"American Beauty.\" And so what he did was he took\nthe best elements of theater and applied them to the process. So we rehearsed it like\na play in a sound stage where everything was laid out\nlike it would be in a play and this couch will be here. And he'd sent me a couple of tapes. He'd sent me a two cassette tapes, one that he'd like to call pre-Lester before he begins to move in the direction and then post-Lester and they\njust were different songs. And then he said to me one day, and I think always\nthought this was brilliant of Sam to use Lemmon, knowing\nwhat Lemmon meant to me. He said, \"When was the last time you watched 'The Apartment?'\" And I said, \"I don't know. I mean, I love that movie so much.\" He goes, \"I want you to watch\nit again and then let's talk.\" So I went and I watched the movie again and we sat down and Sam said, \"What Lemmon does in\nthat film is incredible because there is never\na moment in the movie where we see him change. He just evolves. And he becomes the man he becomes because of the experiences that he has through the course of the film. But there's this remarkable\nconsistency in who he becomes and that's what I need\nyou to do as Lester. I don't want the audience\nto ever see him change. I want him to evolve.\" And so we did some... I mean, first of all it\nwas just a great direction. And then second of all, we did some things that people don't know we did to aid that gradual shift\nof that man's character. First of all, I had to\nbe in the best shape from the beginning of the movie 'cause we didn't shoot it in sequence. So I was in this crazy shape. I had this wonderful\ntrainer named Mike Tosher, who just was incredible. But so what we did was, in order to then show\nthis gradual shift was I had three different hair pieces, I had three different kinds of costumes of different colors and sizes, and I had different makeup. So in the beginning I was wearing a kind of drab, dull, slightly, you\nknow, uninspired hairpiece and my makeup was kind of gray and boring. And I was a little bit, there were times when I was\nlike, too much like this and Sam would go, \"Kevin,\nyou look like Walter Matthau. Would you please stand up a little bit?\" We're sort of midway\nthrough at this point. And then at a certain\npoint the wig changed and it had little highlights\nin it, a little more color, a little more, the makeup became a little, the suits got a little tighter. And then finally a third wig\nthat was golden highlights and sunshine and you know,\nrosy cheeks and tight fit. And these are what we\ncall theatrical tricks. You know, this is how you... An audience doesn't even\nknow it's happening, but it is this gradual... And I just always felt that that was such a brilliant way because he knew what I felt about Jack. And when you watch \"The\nApartment,\" it is extraordinary that he doesn't ever change. And in fact I thanked Jack when I won the Oscar and I did my thank you speech and I walked off stage and I remember I had to\nsit down for a moment because I didn't want\nto go to the press room because I wanted to see\nif Sam was gonna win. And so I was waiting and my phone rang and it was Lemmon. He said, \"You're a son of a bitch.\" I said, \"What?\" He goes, \"First of all, congratulations and thanks for thanking me 'cause, you know, God knows you couldn't\nhave done it without me.\" He said, \"Second of all,\" he said, \"Do you know how long it took me to\nwin from supporting actor? I won it for \"Mister Roberts\" and it took me like 10,\n12 years to win the Oscar. You did it in four, you son of a bitch.\" - Yeah, \"The Apartment,\" I\nmean, it's widely considered one of the greatest movies ever. People sometimes refer to it as a comedy, which is an interesting\nkind of classification. I suppose that's a lesson about comedy that the best comedy is the\none that's basically a tragedy. - Well, I mean, some people think \"Clockwork Orange\" is a comedy, and I'm not saying there\naren't some good laughs in \"Clockwork Orange\" but\nyeah, you know, it's... - I mean, yeah. What's that line between\ncomedy and tragedy for you? - Well, if it's a line, it's a line I cross all the time because I've tried always to find the humor unexpected sometimes, maybe inappropriate\nsometimes, maybe shocking. But I've tried in I think almost every\ndramatic role I've had to have a sense of humor and to be able to bring that along with everything else that is serious. Because frankly, that's how we deal with stuff in life, you know. - I think Sam Mendes actually said in the Now documentary, something like, \"With great theater, with\ngreat stories, you find humor on the journey to the heart of darkness,\" something like this. Very poetic, it stood out to me but it's true. - I'm sorry I can't be that poetic. I'm very sorry. - But it's true. I mean, the people I've interacted with in this world that have\nbeen to a war zone, and the ones who have lost the most and have suffered the\nmost are usually the ones who are able to make jokes the quickest. And the jokes are often dark and absurd and cross every single line. No political correctness, all of that. - Sure. Well, I mean, you know, it's like the great\n\"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" where they can't stop giggling\nat at the clown's funeral. I mean, it's just one of\nthe great episodes ever. You know, giggling at a funeral is as bad as farting at a funeral. And, you know, I'm sure\nthat there's some people who have done both. - Oh man, so you mentioned\n\"American Beauty\" and the idea of not\nchanging, but evolving. That's really interesting because that movie is about\nlike finding yourself. It's a philosophically profound movie. It's about various characters in their own ways,\nfinding their own identity in a world where a materialistic system that wants you to be like everyone else. And so, I mean, Lester\nreally transforms himself throughout the movie. And you're saying the challenge there is to still be the same\nhuman being fundamentally. - Yeah, and I also think\nthat the film was powerful because you had three very honest and genuine portrayal of young people. And then you had Lester\nbehaving like a young person, doing things that were unexpected. And I think that the honesty with which it dealt with those issues that those teenagers were going through, and the honesty with which it dealt with what Lester was going\nthrough, I think are some of the reasons why the film\nhad the response that it did from so many people. I mean, I used to get stopped and someone would say to me, \"When I first saw 'American\nBeauty,' I was married, and the second time I saw it, I wasn't.\" And I was like, \"Well, we weren't trying to increase the divorce rate. You know, it wasn't our intention.\" But it is interesting how so many people have those kinds of crazy fantasies. And what I admired so much about who Lester was as a person,\nwhy I wanted to play him is because in the end, he\nmakes the right decision. - I think a lot of people live\nlives of quiet desperation in a job they don't like, in a marriage they're unhappy in and to see somebody living that life and then saying fuck it\nin every way possible, and not just in a cynical way, but in a way that opens\nthem, opens Lester up to see the beauty in the world. That's, you know, the\nbeauty in \"American Beauty.\" - Well, and you know, you may\nhave to blackmail your boss to get there, but, you know. - And in that, there's\na bunch of humor also in the anger and in the absurdity of sort of taking a stand\nagainst the conformity of life, there's this humor. And I read somewhere that\nthe scene, the dinner scene, which is kind of play like where Lester slams the plate against the wall was improvised by you, the slamming of the\nplate against the wall. - No, absolutely. - [Lex] The internet lies once again. - Absolutely written and directed. Yeah, can't take credit for that. - The plate, okay. Well, that was a genius interaction there. There's something about the dinner table and losing your shit at the dinner table, having a fight and losing your shit at the dinner table. Where else? Like \"Yellowstone\" was another situation where it's a family at the dinner table and then one of them says, \"Fuck it, I'm not eating this anymore and I'm going to create a scene.\" - [Kevin] Right. - It's a beautiful kind of\nenvironment for dramatic scenes. - Or Nicholson in \"The Shining.\" I mean, there's some\nfamily scenes gone awry in that movie. - The contrast between\nyou and Annette Bening in that scene creates\nthe genius of that scene. So how much of acting is the\ndance between two actors? - Well, with Annette, I just\nadored working with her. And we were the two actors that Sam wanted from the very beginning, much against the will of the higher ups who wanted other actors\nto play those roles. But I've known Annette since we did a screen test\ntogether for Milos Forman for a film he did of the \"Les\nLiaisons dangereuses\" movie. It was a different film from that one, but it was the same story. And I've always thought,\nshe's just remarkable. And I think that the work\nshe did in that film, the relationship that\nwe were able to build, for me, the saddest\npart of that success was that she didn't win the Oscar and I felt she should have. - What kind of interesting\ndirection did you get from Sam Mendes in how you\napproach playing Lester in how to take on the different scenes? There's a lot of just\nbrilliant scenes in that movie. - Well, I'll share with you a story that most people don't know, which is our first two\ndays of shooting were in Smiley's, the place where I get a job in a fast food place. - [Lex] Yeah, it's a burger joint. Yeah. - And I guess it was\nlike maybe the third day or the fourth day of\nshooting, we'd now done that and I said to Sam, \"So\nhow are the dailies? You know, how do they look?\" He goes, \"Which ones?\" I said, \"Well, the first smileys.\" He goes, \"Oh, they're shit.\" And I went, \"Yeah, no, how are they?\" He goes, \"No, they're shit. I hate them. I hate everything about them. I hate the costumes, I hate the location. I hate that you're inside.\nI hate the way you acted. I hate everything but the script. So I've gone back to the studio and asked them if we can\nreshoot the first two days.\" And it was like, \"Sam, this\nis your very first movie. You're going back to Steven Spielberg and saying I need to reshoot\nthe first two days entirely?\" And he went, \"Yeah.\" And that's exactly what we did. A couple of weeks later they decided that it was now a drive-through, because Annette and Peter\nGallagher used to come into the place and\nordered from the counter. Now, Sam had decided it\nhas to be a drive-through. You have to be in the\nwindow of the drive-through, change the costumes and we\nre-shot those first two days. And Sam said it was actually a moment of incredible confidence because he said the worst thing that could possibly\nhave happened, happened in my first two days. And after that I was like,\nI know what I'm doing and I knew I had to reshoot it and it was absolutely right. - And I guess that's what a\ngreat director must do, is have the guts in that moment\nto reshoot everything. I mean, that's a pretty gutsy move. - I got two other little things to share with you about Sam, about the way he is. You wouldn't know it but the original script opened\nand closed with a trial. Ricky was accused of Lester's murder and the movie was bookended by this trial. - It's a very different movie, - Which they shot the\nentire trial for weeks. And I used to fly in my dreams, you know, those opening\nshots over the neighborhood. I used to come into those shots in my bathrobe, flying, and\nthen when I hit the ground and the newspaper was thrown\nat me by the newspaper guy and I caught it, the alarm would go off and I wake up in bed. I spent five days being hung by wires and filming these sequences\nof flying through my dreams. And Sam said to me, \"Yeah, the\nflying sequences are all gone and the trial is gone.\" And I was like, \"What? What\nare you talking about?\" And here's my other little\nfavorite story about Sam and when we were shooting in the valley, one of those places I flew,\nthis was an indoor set, Sam said to me in the morning, \"Hey, at lunch I just\nwanna record a guide track of all the dialogue, all of your narration 'cause they just needed\nan editing as a guide.\" And I said, \"Sure.\" So I remember we came\noutside in this hallway where I had a dressing room in this little studio we were in and Sam had like a cassette tape recorder and like a little microphone and we put it on the floor\nand he pushed record. And I read the entire narration and I never did it again. That's the narration in the movie, because Sam said when he listened to it, I wasn't trying to do anything. He said, \"You had no idea\nwhere these things were going, where they were gonna be placed,\nwhat they were gonna mean. You just read it so innocently,\nso purely, so directly that I knew if I brought you into a studio and put headphones on you and had you do it again,\nit would change the ease with which you'd done it.\" And so they just fixed all of the problems that they had with this little cassette. And that is the way I did it and the only time I did it\nwas in this little hallway. - And once again, a great\nperformance lies in doing less. The innocence and the purity of Lester. - He knew I would've come into\nthe studio and fucked it up. - Yeah, what do you think about the notion of beauty that permeates\n\"American Beauty?\" What do you think that\ntheme is with the roses, with the rose petals, the characters that are living this\nmundane existence slowly opening their eyes up to\nwhat is beautiful in life? - See, it's funny, I\ndon't think of the roses and I don't think of\nher body in the poster, and I don't think of those\nthings as the beauty. I think of the bag. I think that there are things we miss that are right in front of us that are truly beautiful. - The little things, the simple things. - Yeah and in fact, I'll\neven tell you something that I always thought was so incredible. When we shot the scenes in the office where Lester worked the job he hated, there was a bulletin\nboard behind me on a wall. And someone who was watching\na cut or early dailies who was in the marketing department saw that someone had cut out\na little piece of paper and stuck it and it said, \"Look closer.\" And they presented that to Sam as the idea of that could go on the poster. The idea of looking closer\nwas such a brilliant idea, but I mean, it wasn't in the script, it was just on a wall behind me and someone happened to\nzoom in on it and see it and thought that's what\nthis movie's about. This movie's about taking\nthe time to look closer. And I think that in\nitself is just beautiful."

      "text": "- Mortality also permeates the film. You know, it starts with acknowledging that death is on the way that Lester's time is finite. You ever think about your own death? - Yeah, yeah. - [Lex] Scared of it? - When I was at my lowest\npoint, yes, it scared me. - What does that fear look like? What's the nature of the fear? What are you afraid of? - That there's no way out. That there's no answer. That nothing makes sense. - See, the interesting thing about Lester is facing the same fear, he seemed to be somehow liberated\nand accepted everything and then saw the beauty of it. - Because he got there. He was given the opportunity\nto reinvent himself and to try things he'd never tried, to ask questions he'd never asked, to trust his instincts and to become the best version\nof himself he could become. And so Dick Van Dyke who has become an\nextraordinary friend of mine, Dick is 98 years old, and he says, you know, \"If I'd known I was gonna live this long, I would've taken better care of myself.\" When I spend time with him, I'm just moved by every day. You know, he gets up and he goes, \"It's a good day. I woke up.\" And I learn a lot about... I have a different feeling about death now than I did seven years ago. And I am on the path to\nbeing able to be in a place where I've resolved the\nthings I needed to resolve and won't probably get to\nall of it in my lifetime, but I certainly would like\nto be at a place where if I were to drop dead tomorrow, it would've been an amazing life. - So Lester got there. It sounds like Dick Van Dyke got there. You're trying to get there. - Sure."

      "section": "Allegations",
      "text": "- You said you feared\ndeath at your lowest point. What was the lowest point? - It was November 1st, 2017, and then Thanksgiving\nday of that same year. - So let's talk about it. Let's\ntalk about this dark time. Let's talk about the sexual\nallegations against you that led to you being canceled by, well, the entire world\nfor the last seven years. I would like to personally\nunderstand the sins, the bad things you did, and\nthe bad things you didn't do. So I also should say that the\nthing I hope to do here is to give respect to due process, innocent until proven guilty that the mass hysteria\nmachine of the internet and clickbait journalism doesn't do. So here's what I understand. They were criminal and civil\ntrials brought against you, including the one that started it all when Anthony Rapp sued\nyou for $40 million. In these trials, you were\nacquitted, found not guilty, and not liable. Is that right?\n- Yes. - I think that's really important, again, in terms of due process. And I read a lot and I watched a lot in preparation\nfor this, on this point, including, of course, the\nrecently detailed interviews you did with Dan Wootton and then Allison Pearson of the Telegraph and those are all focused on this topic, and they go in detail\nwhere you respond in detail to many of the allegations. If people are interested in the details, they can listen to those. So based on that, and\neverything I looked at, as I understand, you never\nprevented anyone from leaving if they wanted to, sort\nof in a sexual context, for example, by blocking the door. Is that right? - That's correct. Yeah. - You always respected the\nexplicit no from people, again in the sexual context. Is that right? - That is correct. - You've never done anything sexual with an underage person, right? - Never. - And also, as it's sometimes done in Hollywood, let me ask this. You've never explicitly offered\nto exchange sexual favors for career advancement, correct? - Correct. - In terms of bad\nbehavior, what did you do? What was the worst of it,\nand how often did you do it? - I have heard, and now quite often, that everybody has a Kevin Spacey story and what that tells me is\nthat I hit on a lot of guys. - How often did you cross the line and what does that mean to you? - I did a lot of horsing\naround and a lot of things that at the time I thought\nwere sort of playful and fun and I have learned since were not. And I have had to recognize\nthat I crossed some boundaries and I did some things that were wrong, and I made some mistakes and that's in my past. I mean, I've been working so hard over these last seven years to have the conversations\nI needed to have, to listen to people, to understand things from\na different perspective than the one that I had and to say, I will never\nbehave that way again for the rest of my life. - Just to clarify, I think\nyou are often too pushy with the flirting, and that manifests itself in multiple ways but just to make clear, you never prevented anyone\nfrom leaving if they wanted to. You always took the\nexplicit no from people as an answer, \"No, stop,\"\nyou took that for the answer. You've never done anything\nsexual with an underage person, and you've never explicitly offered to exchange sexual favors\nfor career advancement. These are some of the sort of accusations that have been made. And in the court of law, multiple\ntimes have been shown not to be true. - But I have had a sexual\nlife and I've fallen in love, and I've been so admiring\nof people that... I mean, I'm so romantic. I'm such a romantic person that there's this whole side of me that hasn't been talked\nabout, isn't being discussed but that's who I know, that's the person I know. It's been very upsetting to hear that some people have said, I mean, I don't have a\nviolent bone in my body, but to hear people describe things as having been very aggressive is incredibly difficult for me. And I'm deeply sorry that\nI ever offended anyone or hurt anyone in any way. It is crushing to me, and\nI have to work very hard to show and to prove that I\nhave learned, I got the memo and I will never, ever, ever\nbehave in those ways again. - From everything I've\nseen in public interactions with you, people love you. Colleagues love you, coworkers love you. There's a flirtatiousness. Another word for that is chemistry. There's a chemistry between\nthe people you work with. - And by the way, not\nto take anything away from my accountability for things I did, where I got it wrong, I crossed the line, I pushed some boundaries. I accept all of that but I live in an industry in which flirtation,\nattraction, people meeting in the workspace and ending\nup marrying each other and having children and so it is a space and a place where these notions of family,\nthese notions of attraction, these notions of... It's always complicated if you\nmeet someone in the workspace and find yourselves\nattracted to each other. You have to be mindful of that. And you have to be very mindful that you don't ever want anyone to feel that their job is in jeopardy, or you would punish them in some way if they no longer wanted to be with you. So those are important\nthings to just acknowledge. - Another complexity to\nthis, as I've seen, is that there's just a huge number of actors that look up to you, a\nhuge number of people in the industry that look\nup to you and love you. I've seen just from this documentary, just a lot of people just\nlove being around you, learning from you what it means to create great theater,\ngreat film, great stories. And so that adds to the complexity. I wouldn't say it's a power dynamic like a boss-employee relationship. It's a admiration dynamic that is easy to miss and\neasy to take advantage of. Is that something you understand? - Yes, and I also understand\nthat there are people who met me and spent a very\nbrief period of time with me, but presume I was now\ngoing to be their mentor and then behaved in a way\nthat I was unaware of, that they were either\nparticipating or flirting along or encouraging me without\nme having any idea that at the end of the day,\nthey were expecting something. So these are about relationships, and these are about two people. These are about people making decisions, people making choices and I accept my accountability in that. But there are a number of\nthings that I've been accused of that just simply did not happen. And I can't say, and I don't think it would\nbe right for me to say, well, you know, everything that's ever been I've\nbeen accused of is true because we've now proved\nthat it isn't and it wasn't. But I'm perfectly willing to\naccept that I had behaviors that were wrong and that\nI shouldn't have done and I am regretful for. - I think that's also speaks\nto a dark side of fame. The sense I got is that\nthere are some people, potentially a lot of people\ntrying to make friends with you in order to get roles, in order to advance their career. So not you using them, but\nthey trying to use you. What's that like? How do you know if somebody\nlikes you for you, for Kevin, or likes you for... Like you said you're a\nromantic, you see a person and you're like, I like this person, and they seem to like you. How do you know if they like you for you? - Well, to some degree, I\nwould say that I have been able to trust my instincts on that and now that I've, most\nof the time been right. But obviously in the last number of years, not just with people who've accused me, but just also people in\nmy own industry, you know, to realize that, oh, I\nthought we had a friendship, but I guess that was about an inch thick and not what I thought it was. But look, you know, one\nshouldn't be surprised by that. I have to also say, you know,\nyou said a little while ago that the world had canceled me and I have to disagree with you. I have to disagree because for seven years I've been stopped by people, sometimes every day,\nsometimes multiple times a day and the conversations\nthat I have with people, the generosity that they share,\nthe kindness that they show and how much they wanna know\nwhen I'm getting back to work, tells me that while there\nmay be a very loud minority, there is a quieter majority. - In the industry, have you been betrayed? In life? And how do you not\nlet that make you cynical? - I think betrayal is a\nreally interesting word, but I think if you're going\nto be betrayed, it has to be by those who truly know you and I can tell you that\nI have not been betrayed. - That's a beautiful way to put it. For the times, you crossed the line, do you take responsibility\nfor the wrongs you've done? - Yes. - Are you sorry to the people\nyou may have hurt emotionally? - Yes. And I have spoken to many of them. - [Lex] Privately. - Privately, which is where\namends should be made. - Were they able to start\nfinding forgiveness? - Absolutely. Some of the most moving\nconversations that I have had when I was determined to take accountability\nhave been those people who have said, \"Thank you so much and I think I can forgive you now.\" - If you got a chance to\ntalk to the Kevin Spacey of 30 to 40 years ago,\nwhat would you tell him to change about his ways and how would you do it? What would be your approach? Would you be nice about it? Would you smack him around? - I think if I were to go back that far, I probably would've found a way to not have been as concerned\nabout revealing my sexuality and hiding that for as long as I did. I think that had a lot\nto do with confusion and a lot to do with mistrust, both my own and other people's. - For most of your life, you were not open with the public about being gay. What was the hardest thing about keeping who you love a secret? - That I didn't find the\nright moment of celebration to be able to share that. - That must be a thing that weighs on you to not be able to fully,\nyeah, celebrate your love. - You know, Ian McKellen said,\nhe was 49 when he came out. 27 years, he'd been a\nprofessional actor being in the closet. And he said he felt it was\nlike he was living a part of his life not being truthful and that he felt that it affected his work when he did come out, because he no longer felt\nlike he had anything to hide. And I absolutely believe that that is what my experience has\nbeen and will continue to be. I am sorry about the way I came out, but Evan and I had already\nhad the conversation. I had already decided to come out. And so it wasn't like, oh,\nI was forced to come out, but it was something I decided to do. And by the way, much\nagainst Evan's advice, I came out in that statement and he wishes that I had not done so. - Yeah, you made a statement when the initial accusation happened that could be up there as one of the worst social\nmedia posts of all time. (Kevin chuckles) So it's like two for one. - Don't hold back now. Come on. Really tell me how you feel. - The first part, you kind\nof implicitly admitted to doing something bad,\nwhich was later shown and proved completely\nto never have happened. It was a lie. - No, I basically said\nthat I didn't remember what this person,\nAnthony Rapp was claiming from 31 years before. I had no memory of it but if it had happened, if this embarrassing moment had happened, then I would owe him an apology. That was what I said. And then I said, and while I'm\nat it, I think I'll come out. And, you know, it was definitely not the greatest coming out party ever. I will admit that. - Well, from the public perception, the first part of that... So first of all, the second\npart is a horrible way to come out. Yes, we all agree. And then the first part\nfrom the public viewpoint, they see guilt in that which also is tragic because at least that\nparticular accusation, and it's a very dramatic one, it's a $40 million\nlawsuit, it's a big deal and an underage person\nwas shown to be false. - Well, but you're melding\ntwo things together. The lawsuit didn't happen until 2020 and then it didn't get\nto court until 2022. We're back in 2017 when it\nwas just an accusation he made in Buzzfeed Magazine. Look, I was backed into a corner. When someone says, \"You were so drunk, you won't remember this thing happened,\" what's your first instinct? Is your first instinct to\nsay, this person's a liar? Or is your first instinct\nto go, \"What? I was what? 31 years at a party I don't\neven remember throwing?\" Obviously a lot of investigation\nhappened after that in which we were then able\nto prove in that court case, that it had never occurred. But at the moment, I was sort of being told I couldn't push back, you have to be kind, you can't... I think, you know, even to me\nnow, none of it sounds right but I don't know that I\ncould have said anything that would've been\nsatisfactory to anybody. - Okay, well there is a\nalmost convincing explanation for the worst social\nmedia post of all time. I almost accept it. - I'm really surprised. I guess you haven't read\na lot of media posts 'cause I can't believe\nthat's the actual worst one. - It's beautifully bad. That's how bad that social media post is. As you mentioned, Liam Neeson and Sharon Stone came out in support of you recently, speaking\nto your character. A lot of people who know you and some of whom I know who have worked with you\nprivately show support for you, but are afraid to speak up publicly. What do you make of that? I mean, to me personally,\nthis just makes me sad because it perhaps that's\nthe nature of the industry that it's difficult to do that but I just wish there would be a little bit\nmore courage in the world. - I don't think it's about the industry. I think it's about our time. I think it's the time that we're in and people are very afraid. - Just afraid, just a\ngeneral fear of (indistinct). - No, they're literally afraid that they're gonna get canceled if they stand up for someone who has been. And I think it's, I mean, you know, we've seen\nthis many times in history. This is not the first time it's happened."

      "section": "House of Cards",
      "text": "- So as you said, your darkest moment in 2017 when all of this went down, one of the things that\nhappened is you were no longer in the \"House of Cards\"\nfor the last season. Now let's go to the\nbeginning of that show. - [Kevin] Okay. - One of the greatest\nTV series of all time. A dark, fascinating\ncharacter in Frank Underwood. A ruthless, cunning,\nborderline evil politician. What are some interesting aspects to the process you went through\nbecoming Frank Underwood? Maybe, \"Richard III,\" there's\na lot of elements there in your performance that may be inspired that character. Is that fair or no? - I'll give you one very\ninteresting, specific education that I got in doing \"Richard III\" and closing that show\nat BAM in March of 2012 and two months later started\nshooting House of Cards. There is something called direct address. In Shakespeare, you have\nHamlet talks to the world but when Shakespeare wrote \"Richard III,\" it was the first time he created something called direct address, which is the character looks directly at each person close by. It is a different kind of sharing than when a character's doing\na monologue opening of \"Henry IV.\" And while there are\nsome people who believe that direct address was invented in Ferris Bueller, it wasn't. It was Shakespeare who invented it. So I had just had this\nexperience every night in theaters all over the world,\nseeing how people reacted to becoming a co-conspirator, because that's what it's about. And what I tried to do and what Fincher really helped me with in those beginning days was\nhow to look in that camera and imagine I was talking\nto my best friend. - Because you're sharing\nthe secret of the darkness of how this game is played\nwith that best friend. - Yeah and there were many times when I suppose the writers\nthought I was crazy, where I would see a script and I would see like this moment where this direct address would happen, I'd say all this stuff when we do a read through of the script, I go, \"I don't think I\nneed to say any of that.\" And they were like, \"What do you mean?\" I said, \"Well, the\naudience knows all of that. All I have to do is look. They know exactly what's going on. I don't need to say a thing.\" So I was often cutting dialogue because it just wasn't needed because that relationship\nbetween that I'd learned, that I'd experienced\ndoing \"Richard III\" was so extraordinary where I\nliterally watched people, they were like, oh, I'm in on the thing and this is so awesome and then suddenly, wait,\nhe killed the kids. He killed those kids in the tower. Oh, maybe it's not so. And you literally would watch them start to reverse their, having\nhad such a great time with \"Richard III\" in the\nfirst, you know, three acts and I thought, this is\ngonna happen in this show if this intimacy can actually land. And I think just think there\nwas some brilliant writing and we always attempted\nto do it in one take. No matter how long something\nwas, we would try to do it in one take, the direct addresses. So there was never a cut. When we went out on locations, we started to then find ways to cut it and make it slightly broader. - That's interesting\n'cause you're doing a bunch with both \"Richard III\" and\nFrank Underwood, a bunch of dark, borderline, evil things. And then I guess the idea is you're going to be losing the audience and then you win them back\nover with the addresses. - That's the remarkable thing\nis against their instincts and their better sense of what they should and should not do, they still rallied around Frank Underwood. - And I saw even with the\ndocumentary, the glimmers of that with \"Richard III,\" I mean,\nyou were seducing the audience. Like there was such a chemistry between you and the audience on stage. Why is that?\n- Yeah, well in that production,\nthat's absolutely true. Also, Richard is one of the weirder, weird, I mean by weird is an\nearly play of Shakespeare's. And he's basically never off stage. I mean, I remember when we\ndid the first run through, I had no idea what the next scene was every time I came off stage, I had no idea what was next. They literally had to\ndrag me from one place to another scene. \"Now it's the scene with Hasting. Now it's the scene...\" But I now understand\nthese wonderful stories that you can read in old\nbooks about Shakespeare's time that actors grabbed\nShakespeare around the cuff and punched him and threw him against wall and said, \"You ever write\na part like this again, I'm gonna kill you.\" And that's why in later plays, he started to have a pageant happen,\nand then a wedding happen and the main character\nwas off stage resting because the actor had said,\n\"You can't do this to us. There's no breaks.\" And it's true. This very\nfew breaks in \"Richard III.\" You're on stage most of the time. - The comedic aspect of \"Richard\nIII\" and Frank Underwood, is that a component that helps\nbring out the full complexity of the darkness that is Frank Underwood? - I certainly can't take credit for Shakespeare having written\nsomething that is funny or Beau Willimon and his team\nto have written something that is fundamentally funny. It just depends on how I interpret it. You know, that's one of the great things and why we love... You know, in a year's time, we can see five different Hamlets, we can see four Richard IIIs, we can see two Richard IIs. That's part of the thrill\nthat we don't own these parts. We borrow them and we interpret them. And what Ian McKellen might do with a role could be\ncompletely different from what I might do because of the way we perceive it. And also very often in\nterms of going for humor, it's very often a director will say, why don't you say that\nwith a bit of irony? Why don't you try that with\na bit of blah blah blah? - Yeah, there's often that\nthat like a wry smile. The line that jumps to me when you're talking about Claire in the early, maybe first episode even, \"I love that woman more\nthan sharks love blood.\" I mean, I guess there's a lot\nof ways to read that line, but the way you read it had both humor, had legitimate affection, had all the ambition and narcissism, all of that mixed up together. - I also think that one\nshould just acknowledge that where he was from. There is something that\nhappens when you do an accent. And in fact, sometimes\nwhen I would say to Beau or one of the other writers,\n\"This is really good and I love the idea, but it\nrhythmically doesn't help. I need at least two more words to rhythmically make\nthis work in his accent because it just doesn't scan.\" And that's not, I am a big pentameter. I'm not talking about that. There is that as well in Shakespeare but there was some times when it's too many lines,\nit's not enough lines in order for me to make this work for the way he speaks, the way he sounds and what that accent does to emphasis. - How much of that character\nin terms of the musicality of the way he speaks is Bill Clinton? - Not really at all. I mean, you know, look, Bill Clinton, he had a way of talking, you\nknow, that he was very slow and he felt your pain, you know, but Frank Underwood was\na deeper, more direct and less poetic in the way that Clinton would talk. I'll tell you this Clinton\nstory that you'll like. So we decide to do a performance\nof \"The Iceman Cometh\" for the Democratic Party on Broadway. And the president is gonna come, he's gonna see this four\nand a half hour play and then we're gonna do\nthis event afterward. And I dunno, a couple weeks before we're gonna do this event, someone at the White House calls and says, \"Listen, it's very\nunusual to get the president for like six and a half hours so we're suggesting\nthat the president come and see the first act and then he goes.\" And I knew what was happening. Now, first of all,\nClinton knows this play. He knows what this play's about. And, you know, as gently as I could said, \"Well, if the president is thinking of leaving at intermission, then I'm afraid we're gonna\nhave to cancel the event. There's just no way that...\" So anyway, then, \"Oh no, it's fine.\" Now I know what was happening. What was happening was that\nsomeone had read the play and they were quite concerned and I'll tell you why 'cause the play is about this character that I portrayed named Hickey. And in the course of the\nplay, as things get more and more revealed, you\nrealize that this man that I'm playing has been a philander and he's cheated on his wife quite a lot. And by the end of the play,\nhe is arrested and taken off because he ended up ending his wife's life because she forgave him too much and he couldn't live with it. So now imagine this, there's 2000 people at the Brooks Atkinson Theater watching President Clinton watching this play. And at the end of the night\nwe take our curtain call, they bring out the presidential podium, Bill Clinton stands up there and he says, \"Well, I suppose\nwe should all thank Kevin and this extraordinary company of actors for giving us all saw way\ntoo much to think about.\" (both laugh) And the audience fell over in laughter. And then he gave a great speech. And I thought that was a\npretty good way to handle that. - Well, in that way, him and Frank Underwood would\nshare like a charisma. There's certain presidents that just have, politicians that just have this charisma you can't stop listening to them. Some of it is the accent, but some of it's some other magical thing. - When I was starting to do research, I wanted to meet with\nthe whip, Kevin McCarthy, and he wouldn't meet with me until I called his office back and said, \"Tell him\nI'm playing a Democrat, and not a Republican,\" and then he met with me. - [Lex] Nice. - And he was helpful. He\ntook me to whip meetings. - Politicians. So you worked with David Fincher there. He was the executive producer, but he also directed\nthe first two episodes. - [Kevin] Yeah. - High level, what was it\nlike working with him again? In which ways do you\nthink he helped guide you and the show to become the\ngreat show that it was? - I give him a huge amount of the credit. And not just for what he established, but the fact that every director after stayed within that world. I think that's why the series had a very\nconsistent feeling to it. It was like watching a very long movie. The style, where the\ncamera went, what it did, what it didn't do, how we\nused this, how we used that, how we didn't do this, there were things that he\nlaid the foundation for that we managed to maintain pretty much until Beau Willimon left the show and they got rid of Fincher and I was sort of the last man standing in terms of fighting against... Netflix had never had any\ncreative control at all. We had complete creative control, but over time they started\nto get themselves involved because look, this is\nwhat happens to networks. You know, they'd never made\na television show before ever and then four years\nlater, they were the best. And so, you know, then you're gonna get\nsuggestions about casting and about writing and\nabout music and scenes. And so there was a\nconsiderable amount of pushback that I had to do when they\nstarted to get involved in ways that I thought was affecting\nthe quality of the show. - What were those battles like? I heard that there was\na battle with the execs. Like you mentioned early on\nabout your name not being on the billing for \"Se7en.\" I heard that there's battles\nabout the ending of \"Se7en,\" which was really, well, it's pretty dark. So what's that battle like? How often does that happen and\nhow do you win that battle? Because it feels like there's a line where the networks or the\nexecs are really afraid of crossing that line into this strange, uncomfortable place. And then the great directors\nand great actors kind of flirt with that line. - It can happen in different ways. I mean, I remember one argument we had was we had specifically shot a scene so that there would be\nno score in that scene so that there was no music. It was just two people talking. And then we end up seeing a cut where they've decided to put music in. And it is against everything that scene's supposed to be about. And you have to go and say, \"Guys, this was intentional.\nWe did not want a score. And now you've added score because what, you think it's too quiet? You think our audience can't listen to two people talk for\ntwo and a half minutes. If this show has proved anything, it's proved that people have patience and they're willing to\nwatch an entire season over a weekend.\" So there are those kind of\narguments that can happen. And you know, they're different arguments on different levels and they sometimes have to do with, I mean look, go back to\n\"The Godfather,\" they wanted to fire Pacino 'cause they\ndidn't see anything happening. They saw nothing happening so\nthey wanted to fire Pacino. And then finally Coppola\nthought, I'll shoot the scene where he kills the police commissioner and they'll do that scene now. And that was the first scene where they went, yeah, actually there's something going on there. So Pacino kept the role. - You think that Godfather\nis when Pacino was like the Pacino we know was born? Or is that more like just the character that really over the top\nin \"Scent of a Woman?\" There's like stages, I suppose. - Yeah, of course. Look, I think that we can't forget that Pacino is also an\nanimal of the theater. You know, he does a lot of plays and he started off doing plays and, you know, movies were, you know, \"The Panic in Needle Park\" was his first. And yeah, I think that period of time when he was doing some incredible\nparts, incredible movies. When I did a series called\n\"Wise Guy,\" I got cast on a Thursday and I flew up\nto Vancouver on a Saturday and I started shooting on Monday. And all I had time to do was watch \"The\nGodfather\" and \"Serpico\" and then I went to work. - Would you say, ridiculous question, Godfather, greatest film of all time? Gun to your head. - Certainly, yes. But also, look, I'm allowed\nto change my opinion. I can next week say it's\n\"Lawrence of Arabia\" or a week after that, I can\nsay \"Sullivan's Travels.\" I mean that's the wonderful\nthing about movies and particularly great movies,\nis when you see them again, it's like seeing them for the first time And you pick up things that\nyou didn't see the last time. - And for that day you fall\nin love with that movie, you might even say to a friend that that is the\ngreatest movie of all time. - And also I think it's the degree with which directors are daring. I mean, Kubrick decided to cast one actor to play three major roles\nin \"Dr. Strangelove.\" I mean, who has the\nballs to do that today?"

I read also that Jack Nicholson\nimprovised, \"Here's Johnny\" in that scene. - I believe that. - That's a very different performance than yours in \"Se7en.\" What do you make of that performance? - Nicholson's always been\nsuch an incredible actor because he has absolutely no shame about being demonstrative and over the top and he also has no\nproblem playing characters who are deeply flawed and\nhe's interested in that. I have a pretty good\nNicholson story though that nobody knows. - You also have a pretty\ngood Nicholson impression, but what's the story? - The story was told to me by\na sound man, Dennis Maitland, who's a great, great, great guy. He said he was very excited because he got on \"Prizzi's Honor,\" which was Jack Nicholson,\nAnjelica Houston, directed by John Huston. And he said, \"I was so excited. It was my first day on the movie, and I get told to go into\nMr. Nicholson's trailer and mic him up for the first scene. So I knock on the trailer door and I hear, 'Yes,' and, 'Come on in.' And I come inside and Mr.\nNicholson is changing out of his regular clothes and he's gonna put on his costume. And so I'm setting up the\nmic and I'm getting ready and I said to Mr. Nicholson, 'I just wanted to tell\nyou I'm extremely excited to be working with you again. It's a great pleasure.'\" And Jack goes, \"Did we\nwork together before?\" And he says, \"Yes, we did.\" And he said, \"What film\ndid we do together?\" He says, \"We did 'Missouri Breaks.'\" Nicholson goes, \"Oh my\nGod, 'Missouri Breaks.' Jesus Christ, we were out\nof our minds on that film. Holy shit, Jesus Christ. It's a wonder I'm alive. My God, there was so much drugs going on and we were stoned out of our minds. Holy shit.\" And just then he folds the pants that he's just taken off over his arm and eighth of coke drops out on the floor. (Lex laughs) Dennis looks at it, Nicholson looks at it, Jack goes, \"Haven't worn these pants since 'Missouri Breaks.'\" (Lex laughs) - Man, I love that guy.\nUnapologetically himself. - Oh yeah."

Huge, really important.\n- [Kevin] Right. - Can you talk about him? Like what role did he play in your life? - I think it was, yeah, it was 1984. I went into audition for the national tour of a play called \"The Real Thing,\" which Jeremy Irons and Glenn\nClose were doing on Broadway that Mr. Nichols had directed. So I went in to read for this character, Brodie, who was a Scottish character. And I did the audition and Mike Nichols comes down\nthe aisle of the theater and he's asking me questions about where'd you go to school and\nwhat have you been doing? I just come back from\ndoing a bunch of years of regional theater and different theaters so I was in New York and meeting Mike Nichols\nwas just incredible. So Mr. Nichols went, \"Have you seen the other play that I directed up the\nblock called 'Hurlyburly?'\" And I said, \"No, I haven't.\" He says, \"Why not?\" I said, \"I can't afford\na Broadway ticket.\" He said, \"We can arrange that. I'd like you to go see that play and then I'd like you to come in next week and audition for that.\" And I was like, \"Oh, okay.\" So I went to see \"Hurlyburly.\" William Hurt, Harvey Keitel, Chris Walken, Candace Bergen,\nCynthia Nixon, Jerry Stiller, and I watched this play. It's a David Rabe play about Hollywood. This is crazy. I mean, Bill Hurt was like unbelievable. And it was extraordinary,\nChris Walken, these guys. So Harvey Keitel, Walken came in later, Harvey Keitel is playing this part. And I come in and I audition for it and Nichols says, \"I want you to understudy Harvey Keitel. I want you to understudy Phil.\" And I'm like, \"Phil?\" I mean, Harvey you could\ntell is like in his forties. He looks like he can beat the shit out of everybody on stage. I'm this like 24-year-old. And Nichols said, \"It's\nall about attitude. If you believe you can beat the shit out of everybody on stage,\nthe audience will too.\" I said, \"Okay.\" So I then started to learn Phil. And the way it works when\nyou're in understudy, unless you're a name, they\ndon't let you rehearse on the stage. You just rehearse in a rehearsal room. But I used to sneak onto\nthe stage and rehearse and try to figure out where\nthe props were and yada yada. Anyway, one day I get a call, \"You're going on today as Phil,\" so I went on. Nichols is told by Peter Lawrence, who's the stage manager,\n\"Spacey's going on as Phil.\" So Nichols comes down and watches the second act. Comes backstage, he says,\n\"That was really good. How soon could you learn Mickey?\" Mickey was the role that\nRon Silver was playing that Chris Walken also played. I said, \"I don't know,\nmaybe a couple weeks.\" He goes, \"Learn Mickey too.\" So I learned Mickey, and then one day, I'm told, \"You're going on tomorrow\nnight as Mickey.\" Nichols comes, sees the second\nact, comes backstage, says, \"That was really good. I\nmean, that was really funny. How soon can you learn Eddie?\" And so I became like the\npinch hitter on \"Hurlyburly.\" I learned all the male parts,\nincluding Jerry Stiller's, although I never went on\nas Jerry Stiller's part. And then I left the play and I guess about two months\nlater, I get this phone call from Mike Nichols. He's like, \"Kevin, how are you?\" And I'm like, \"I'm fine.\nWhat can I do for you?\" He says, \"Well, I'm gonna\nmake a film this summer with Mandy and Meryl, and there's a role I'd like you to come in and audition for.\" So I went in, auditioned, cast me as this mugger on a subway. Then there's this whole\nupheaval that happens because he then doesn't\ncontinue with Mandy Patinkin. Mandy leaves the movie\nand he asks Jack Nicholson to come in and replace Mandy Patinkin. So now I had no scenes with him, but I'm in a movie with Jack\nNicholson and Meryl Streep and my first scene in this movie, which I shot on my\nbirthday July 26th of '85, I got to wink at Meryl\nStreep in this scene. And I was so nervous, I\nliterally couldn't wink. Nichols had to like calm\nme down and help me wink. But that became my very first film. And he was incredible and he let me come and watch when they were shooting\nscenes I wasn't in. And I remember ending up one\nday in the makeup trailer on the same day we were\nworking Jack and me, we had no scene together,\nbut I remember him coming in and they put him down in the chair and they put cucumbers,\nfrozen cucumbers on his eyes and did his neck and then they raised\nhim up and did his face and then I remember\nNicholson went like this, looked in the mirror and he went, \"Another day, another $50,000,\" and walked outta the trailer."

      "text": "- What was Christopher Walken like? He's a theater guy too. - Oh yeah, he started out\nas a cours boy, dancer. - Well, I could see that.\n- Yeah. - The guy knows how to move.\n- Well, it was fun. I've known Walken a long time and I did a Saturday Night Live where we did these Star Wars auditions. So I did Chris Walken as Hans Solo.\n- So good. - And I'll never forget this. I was in Los Angeles\nabout two weeks after, and I was at Chateau Marmont. There's some party\nhappening at Chateau Marmont and I saw Chris Walken\ncome out onto the balcony and I was like, \"Oh, it's Chris Walken.\" And he walked up to it and he went, \"Kevin, I saw your little sketch. It was funny. Ha ha.\" - Oh man, it was a really good sketch. And that guy, there are certain people that are truly unique and unapologetic, continue being that\nthroughout their whole career, the way they talk, the\nmusicality of how they talk, how they are, their\nway of being, he's that and it somehow works. - His watch. - I mean, he works in so\nmany different contexts. He plays like a mobster in \"True Romance\" and it's like genius. That's genius but he could be anything. He could be soft, he could\nbe a badass, all of it and he's always Christopher Walken, but somehow works for all\nthese different characters. So I guess we were talking about \"House of Cards\" like two hours ago before we took a tangent upon a tangent, but there's a moment in episode one where President Walker broke\nhis promise to Frank Underwood that he would make him\na secretary of state. Was this when the monster\nin Frank was born, or was the monster always there? Sort of, for you, looking\nat that character, was there an idealistic notion to him that there's\nloyalty and that broken? Or did he always know that this whole world\nis about manipulation and do anything to get power? - Well, I mean, it might've been the first moment an audience\nsaw him be betrayed, but it certainly was not the first betrayal he'd experienced. And once you start to get to know him and learn about his life\nand learn about his father, and learn about his, you know, friends and learn about their relationship and learn what he was\nlike, even as a cadet, I think you start to\nrealize that this is a man who has very strong beliefs about loyalty. And so it wasn't the first, it was just the first moment that in terms of the storyline\nthat's being built. Knight Takes King was the name\nof our production company. - Yeah, what do you think motivated him at that moment and throughout the show? Was it all about power and also legacy? Or was there some small\npart underneath it all where he wanted to actually\ndo good in the world? - No, I think power is an afterthought. What he loved more than\nanything was being able to predict how human beings would react. He was a behavioral psychologist and he could know, like\nhe was 17 moves ahead in the chess game. He could know if he did\nthis at this moment, that eventually this would happen. He was able to be predictive\nand was usually right. He knew just how far he\nneeded to push someone to get them to do what\nhe needed them to do in order to make the next step work. - You've played a bunch\nof evil characters. - Well, you call 'em evil. But the reason I say that, and I don't mean to be snarky about it, but the reason I say it that way is because I never judge the people I play. And the people that I have played or that any actor has played don't necessarily view\nthemselves as this label. It's easy to say, but that's not the way I can think. I cannot judge a character I\nplay and then play them well. I have to be free of judgment. I have to just play them and let the cards drop where they may, and let an audience judge. I mean, the fact that you use\nthat word is perfectly fine. That's your, you know... But it's like people asking me, you know, \"Was I really from \"CapEx or not?' You know, it just entirely\ndepends on your perspective. - Do roles like that, like \"Se7en,\" like Frank Underwood, like Lester from \"American Beauty,\" do they change you\npsychologically as a person? So walking around in the\nskin of these characters, these complex characters with very different moral systems. - I absolutely believe\nthat wandering around in someone else's ideas,\nin someone else's clothes, in someone else's shoes\nteaches you enormous empathy. And that goes to the heart of not judging. And I have found that I\nhave been so moved by, I mean, look, yes, you've\nidentified the darker characters, but I play Clarence Darrow three times. I've played a play\ncalled National Anthems. I've done movies like \"Recount.\" I've done films like \"The Ref.\" I've done films that in which that doesn't exist in any of those characters, those qualities.\n- [Lex] \"Pay It Forward.\" - \"Pay It Forward.\" And so it is incredible to be able to embrace those things that I admire and that are like me and those things that I don't\nadmire and aren't like me, but I have to put them on an equal footing and say, I have to just\nplay them as best I can and not decide to wield judgment over them. - [Lex] Without judgment. - Without judgment."

      "text": "- In \"Gulag Archipelago,\" Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\nfamously writes about the line between good and evil, and that it runs through\nthe heart of every man. So the full paragraph there, when he talks about the line, \"During the life of any heart this line keeps changing place. Sometimes it is squeezed\none way by exuberant evil, and sometimes it shifts\nto allow enough space for good to flourish. One and the same human being is, at various ages, under\nvarious circumstances, a totally different human being. At times, he's close to being a devil, at times to sainthood, but his name doesn't change. And to that name we ascribe\nthe whole lot, good and evil.\" What do you think about this note that we're all capable of good and evil, and throughout life, that line moves and shifts throughout the\nday, throughout every hour? - Yeah, I mean, one of the things that I've been focused on\nvery succinctly is the idea that every day is an opportunity. It's an opportunity to make better decisions, to learn and to grow. And I also think that, look, I grew up not knowing\nif my parents loved me, particularly my father. I never had a sense that I was loved and that stayed with me my whole life. And when I think back at who my father was and more succinctly who he became, it was a gradual and slow and sad development. When I've gone back, and now I've looked at\ndiaries my father kept, and albums he kept, particularly when he was a medic in the US army, served our country with distinction. When the war was over and they went to Germany,\nthe things my father said, the things that he wrote, the\nthings that he believed were as patriotic as any American\nsoldier who had ever served. But then when he came back to America and he had a dream of being a journalist, or his big hope was that he was gonna be the\ngreat American novelist. He wanted to be a creative novelist and so he sat in his office and he wrote for 45 years and never published anything. And somewhere along the way, in order to make money, he became what they call a\ntechnical procedure writer which the best way to describe that is that if you built the F-16 aircraft, my father would've written the manual to tell you how to do it. I mean, as boring, as technical, as tedious as you can imagine. And so somewhere in the sixties and into the seventies, my father fell in with groups of people and individuals, pretend intellectuals, who started to give him reasons why he was not successful as a white Aryan man in the United States. And over time, my father\nbecame a white supremacist. And I cannot tell you the amount of times as a young boy that my\nfather would sit me down and lecture me for hours and hours and hours about his fucked up ideas of America, of prejudice,\nof white supremacy. And thank God for my sister who said, \"Don't listen to a thing he says. He's out of his mind.\" And even though I was young, I knew everything he was\nsaying was against people and I loved people. I had so many wonderful friends. My best friend Mike, who is still my close friend to this day, I was afraid to bring him to my house because I was afraid that my father would\nfind out he was Jewish or that my father would\nleave his office door open and someone would see his Nazi flag or his pictures of Hitler or Nazi books or what he might say. So when I found theater in the eighth grade and debate club and choir\nand festivals and plays and everything I could\ndo to participate in that wouldn't make me have\nto come back home, I did. I've had to reconcile who he became, because the gap between that man who was in the US Army as a medic and the man he became, I\ncould never fill that gap, but I've forgiven him. But then at the same time,\nI've had to look at my mother and say, she made excuses for him. \"Oh, he just needs to\nget it off his chest. Oh, it doesn't matter. Just let him say.\" So while on the outside, I would say, oh yeah, my mother loved me, but she didn't protect me. So was all the stuff that she expressed and all of the attention and all the love that I felt, was that because I became successful and I was able to fulfill an emptiness that she'd lived with\nher whole life with him? I don't know but I've had to ask myself those questions over these last years, to try to reconcile that for myself. - And the thing you wanted from them and for them is less hate and more love. Did your dad say he loves you? - I don't have any memory of that. I was in a program and they were showing us an experiment that they'd done with psychologists and mothers and fathers and their children and the children were\nanywhere between six months and a year sitting in a little crib. And the exercise was this. Parents are playing with\nthe baby right there, toys, yada yada, baby's laughing and then the psychologist\nwould say, \"Stop\" and the parent would go like this. And you would then watch for the next two and a half,\nthree minutes this child trying to get their parents' attention in any possible way. And I remember when I was sitting in this theater watching this, I saw myself. That was me screaming and reaching out and trying to get my parents' attention. That was me. And that was not something\nI'd ever remembered before, but I knew what that\nbaby was going through."

Some would say, \"Oh, it's\nnot like that at all.\" And then others would say, \"It's closer to the truth\nthan anyone wants to admit,\" and I think I fall down\non the side of that idea. - I have to interview some world leaders, some big politicians. In your understanding of trying\nto become Frank Underwood, what advice would you give in\ninterviewing Frank Underwood? (both laugh) How to get him to say\nanything that's at all honest. - Well, in Frank's case, all\nyou have to do is tell him to look into the camera\nand he'll tell you. He'll tell you what you wanna hear.\n- That's your secret. Unfortunately, we don't get that look into the mind of a person the way we do with Frank Underwood in real life, sadly. - Well, but you could.

And my answer is, I haven't given it yet. So there's a lot more that I wanna be challenged\nby, be inspired by. There's a lot that I don't know. There's a lot I have to learn and that is very exciting\nplace to feel that I'm in. You know, it's been interesting 'cause, you know, we're\ngoing back, we're talking and, you know, it's nice to\ngo back every now and then, but I'm focused on what's next. - Do you hope the world forgives you? - People go to church\nevery week to be forgiven, and I believe that forgiveness, and I believe that redemption\nare beautiful things. I mean, look, don't forget,\nI live in an industry in which there is a tremendous amount of conversation about\nredemption from a lot of people who are very serious people\nin very serious positions, who believe in it. I mean, that guy finally got outta prison that was wrongly accused, that guy who served his\ntime and got out of prison. We see so many people saying, \"Let's find a path for that person. Let's help that person rejoin society.\" But there is an odd situation if you're in the entertainment industry, you're not offered that kind of a path. And I hope that the fear that people are experiencing\nwill eventually subside and common sense will\nget back to the table. - If it does, do you think you have another Oscar worthy performance in you? - Listen, if it would\npiss off Jack Lemmon again for me to win a third time,\nI absolutely think so, yeah. - Well, you have to mention him again.

  "full_text": "- The following is a conversation with Kevin Spacey, a\ntwo-time Oscar winning actor who has starred in \"Se7en,\"\n\"The Usual Suspects,\" \"American Beauty\" and \"House of Cards.\" He is one of the greatest actors ever, creating haunting\nperformances of characters who often embody the dark\nside of human nature. Seven years ago, he was\ncut from \"House of Cards\" and canceled by Hollywood and the world when Anthony Rapp made an allegation that Kevin Spacey sexually\nabused him in 1986. Anthony Rapp then filed a civil\nlawsuit seeking $40 million. In this trial and all civil and criminal trials that\nfollowed, Kevin was acquitted. He has never been found guilty nor liable in the court of law. In this conversation, Kevin makes clear what he did and what he didn't do. I also encourage you to\nlisten to Kevin's Dan Wootton and Alison Pearson interviews\nfor additional details and responses to the allegations. As an aside, let me say that one of the principles I operate under for this podcast and in life is that I will talk with everyone, with empathy and with backbone. For each guest, I hope to\nexplore their life's work, life story and what and how they think and do so honestly and fully. The good, the bad, and the ugly, the brilliance and the flaws. I won't whitewash their sins, but I won't reduce them to\na worse possible caricature of their sins either. The latter is what the mass hysteria of internet mobs too\noften does, often rushing to a final judgment\nbefore the facts are in. I will try to do better than that, to respect due process\nin service of the truth. And I hope to have the courage\nto always think independently and to speak honestly from\nthe heart, even when the eyes of the outrage mob are on me. Again, my goal is to\nunderstand human beings at their best and at their worst. And the hope is such understanding leads to more compassion and\nwisdom in the world. I will make mistakes and when I do, I will\nwork hard to improve. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description and now, dear friends,\nhere's Kevin Spacey. You played a serial killer\nin the movie \"Se7en.\" Your performance was one of, if not the greatest portrayal\nof a murderer on screen ever. What was your process of becoming him, John Doe, the serial killer? - The truth is, I didn't get the part. I had been in Los Angeles\nmaking a couple of films, \"Swimming with Sharks\"\nand \"Usual Suspects,\" and then I did a film called \"Outbreak\" that Morgan Freeman was in. And I went to audition for David Fincher in probably late November of '94. And I auditioned for this\npart and didn't get it and I went back to New York. And I think they started\nshooting like December 12th. And I'm in New York, I'm back in my, I have a wonderful apartment\non West 12th Street and my mom has come to visit for Christmas and it's December 23rd and it's like seven o'clock\nat night and my phone rings and it's Arnold Kopelson,\nwho's the producer of \"Se7en.\" And he's very jovial\nand he's very friendly and he says, \"How you doing?\" And I said, \"Fine.\" And he said, \"Listen, do you remember that film you came in for, Se7en?\" And I said, \"Yeah, absolutely.\" He goes, \"Well, turns out\nthat we hired an actor and we started shooting and then yesterday David fired him. And David would like you\nto get on a plane on Sunday and come to Los Angeles and\nstart shooting on Tuesday.\" And I was like, \"Okay, would it be I imposing\nto say, can I read it again? 'Cause it's been a while\nnow and I'd like to...\" So they sent a script over, I read the script that night. I thought about it and I had this feeling, I can't even quite describe it, but I had this feeling that it would be really good if I didn't take billing in the film. And the reason I felt that was because I knew that by the\ntime this film would come out, it would be the last\none of the three movies that I just shot, the fourth one. And if any of those films\nbroke through or did well, if it was gonna be Brad\nPitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey, and you don't show up for\nthe first 25, 30, 40 minutes, people are gonna figure\nout who you're playing. - So people would know that you play the serial\nkiller in the movie and serial killer shows\nup like more than halfway through the movie.\n- Very late in the movie. - When we say billing,\nit's like the posters, the VHS cover and everything. You're gone. You're not there. - Not there. And so New Line Cinema\ntold me to go fuck myself, that they absolutely could use my picture and my image, blah, blah. And this became a little bit of a, I'd say 24 hour conversation. And it was Fincher who said, \"I actually think this\nis a really cool idea.\" So the compromise was,\nI'm the first credit at the end of the movie\nwhen the credits start. So I got on a plane on that\nSunday and I flew to Los Angeles and I went into where they were shooting, and I went into the makeup room\nand David Fincher was there, and we were talking\nabout what should I do, how should I look. And I just had my hair\nshort for \"Outbreak\" 'cause I was playing a military character and I just looked at the hairdresser and I said, \"Do you have a razor?\" And Fincher went, \"Are you kidding?\" And I said, \"No.\" He goes, \"If you shave your\nhead, I'll shave mine.\" So we both shaved our heads. And then I started shooting the next day. So my long-winded answer\nto your question is that I didn't have that\nmuch time to think about how to build that character. What I think in the end, Fincher was able to do so brilliantly with such terror, was\nto set the audience up to meet this character. - I think the last scene, the ending scene and the car ride leading up to it, where it's mostly on you in conversation with Morgan\nFreeman and Brad Pitt, it's one of the greatest\nscenes in film history. So people who somehow\ndidn't see the movie, there's these five murders that happened that are inspired by five\nof the seven deadly sins and the ending scene is inspired, represents the last two deadly sins. And there's this calm subtlety about you in your performance\nthat's just terrifying. Maybe in contrast with\nBrad Pitt's performance, that's also really strong, but that in the contrast\nis the terrifying sense that you get in the audience that builds up to the twist at the end, or the surprise at the end with the famous, \"What's in\nthe box,\" from Brad Pitt. That is Brad Pitt's\ncharacter's wife, her head. - Yeah, I can really only tell you that while we were shooting\nthat scene in the car, while we were out in the desert, in that place where all\nthose electrical wires were, David just kept saying, \"Less, do less.\" And I just tried to. I mean, I remember he kept saying to me, \"Remember, you are in control. Like you are going to win. And knowing that should allow you to have tremendous confidence.\" And I just followed that lead. And I just think it's the kind of film that so many of the elements that had been at work from the beginning of the movie in terms of its style, in terms of how he built this terror, in terms of how he built for the audience, a sense\nof this person being one of the scariest people that\nhe might ever encounter, it really allowed me to be able\nto not have to do that much, just say the words and mean them. And I think it also, it's an example of what makes tragedy so difficult. I mean, you know, very often tragedy is people operating without enough information. They don't have all the facts. Romeo and Juliet, they\ndon't have all the facts. They don't know what\nwe know as an audience. And so in the end, whether Brad Pitt's character\nends up shooting John Doe or turning the gun on himself, which was a discussion, I\nmean, there were a number of alternative endings that were discussed nothing ends up being tied\nup in a nice little bow. It is complicated and shows how nobody wins in the end when you're not operating\nwith all the information. - When you say, \"Say the\nwords and mean them,\" what does \"mean them\" mean? - I've been very fortunate to be directed by Fincher a couple of times, And he would say to me sometimes, \"I don't believe a thing that\nis coming out of your mouth. Shall we try it again?\" And you go, \"Okay, yeah,\nwe can try it again.\" And sometimes he'll do a take and then you'll look to see if he has any added genius to hand you. And he just goes, \"Let's do it again, and then let's do it again.\" And sometimes I say this in all humility, he's literally trying to\nbeat the acting out of you. And by continually saying, \"Do it again, do it again, do it again\" and not giving you any specifics, he is systematically shredding you of all pretense of all, you know... 'Cause look, very often,\nyou know, actors, we come in on the set and we've\nthought about the scene and we've worked out, you\nknow, I've got this prop and I'm gonna do this thing with a can, you know, all these things all the tea, I'm gonna do a thing with the thing. And David is the kind of director where he just wants you to\nstop adding all that crap and just say the words and say\nthem quickly and mean them. And it takes a while to get to that place. I'll tell you a story. This is a story I just love because it's in the exactly\nthe same wheelhouse. So Jack Lemmon's first\nmovie was a film called \"It Should Happen To You,\" and it was directed by George Cukor. And Jack tells this story, and it was just an\nincredibly charming story to hear Jack tell. He said, \"So I'm doing his picture and let me tell you, this\nis a terrific part for me. And I'm doing a scene,\nit's on my first day, it's my first day, and\nit's a terrific scene.\" And he goes, \"We do the first take and George Cukor comes up to me and he says, 'Jack.\" I said, 'Yeah.' He said, 'Let's do another one, but just do a little less in this one.'\" And Jack said, \"A little less? A little less than what I just did?\" He said, \"Yeah, just a little less.\" So he goes, \"We do another take.\" And I think, \"Boy, that was it. I mean, let's just go home.\" And Cukor walked up to him. He said, \"Jack, let's do\nanother one this time, just a little bit less.\" And Jack said, \"Less than\nwhat I just did now?\" He said, \"Yeah, just a little bit less.\" He goes, \"Oh, okay.\" So he did another take and Cukor came up and he said, \"Jack,\njust a little bit less.\" And Jack said, \"A little\nless than what I just did?\" He said, \"Yes.\" He goes, \"Well, if I do any\nless, I'm not gonna be acting.\" And Cukor said, \"Exactly, Jack exactly.\" - I mean, I guess what you're saying is\nit's extremely difficult to get to the bottom of a little less because the power, if we\njust stick even on \"Se7en\" of your performances in\nthe tiniest of subtleties, like when you say, \"Oh, you didn't know,\" and you turn your head a little bit and a little bit like\nlittle bit maybe a glimmer of a smile appears in your face. That's subtlety, that's less, that's hard to get to, I suppose. - Yeah and also because\nI so well remember, I think the work that Brad did and also Morgan did in that scene, but the work that Brad had\nto do, where he had to go. I remember rehearsing with\nhim as we were all staying at this little hotel nearby that location and we rehearsed the night before we started shooting that sequence. And, I mean, it was just incredible to see the levels of emotions\nhe had to go through, and then the decision of, what do I do? Because if I do what he\nwants me to do, then he wins. But if I don't do it, then what kind of a man, husband am I? I just thought he did\nreally incredible work. So it was also not easy to not react to the power of what\nhe was throwing at me. I just thought it was a\nreally extraordinary scene. - So what's it like being in that scene? So it's you, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Brad Pitt is going over the top just having\na mental breakdown and is weighing these extremely\ndifficult moral choices, as you're saying, but he's like screaming and in pain and tormented while\nyou're very subtly smiling. - In terms of the writing and in terms of what the\ncharacters had to do, it was incredible culmination of how this character could manipulate in the way that he did and in the end, succeed. - You mentioned Fincher\nlikes to do a lot of takes. That's the famous thing\nabout David Fincher. So what are the pros and cons of that? I think I read that he\ndoes some crazy amount. He averages 25 to 65 takes and most directors do less than 10, so. - Yeah, sometimes it's timing. Sometimes it's literally\nhe has a stopwatch and he's timing how\nlong a scene is taking. And then he'll say, \"You need to take a\nminute off this scene.\" \"Like a minute?\" \"Yeah, a minute off this scene. I want it to move like this. So let's pick up the pace. Let's see if we can take a minute off.\" - Why the speed? Why say fast is the important\nthing for him, you think? - I think because\nFincher hates indulgence, and he wants people to talk\nthe way they do in life, which is, you know, we don't take big dramatic pauses, you know, before we speak. We speak, we say what we want. - And I guess actors\nlike the dramatic pauses and the indulge in the dramatic. - We didn't always like\nthe dramatic pauses. I mean, look, you go back, any student of acting, you\ngo back to the thirties and the forties, fifties, the speed at which actors spoke,\nnot just in the comedies, which of course, you know, you look at any Preston Sturges movie, and it's incredible how\nfast people are talking and how funny things are\nwhen they happen that fast. But then, you know, acting styles changed. We got into a different kind of thing in the late fifties and sixties and, you know, a lot of\nactors are feeling it, which is, I'm not saying it's\na bad thing, it's just that if you want to keep an audience\nengaged as Fincher does and I believe successfully\ndoes in all of his work, pace, timing, movement, clarity, speed are admirable to achieve. - In all of that, he wants the actor to be as natural as possible to strip away all the bullshit\nof acting and become human. - Look, I've been lucky\nwith other directors. Sam Mendes is similar. I remember when I walked in\nto maybe the first rehearsal for \"Richard III\" that we were doing, and I had brought with\nme a canopy of ailments that my Richard was going to suffer from. And Sam, you know,\neventually whittled it down to like three, \"Like maybe your arm and maybe your leg but let's get rid of the other 10 things that you brought into the room,\" because, you know, I was so excited to, you know, capture this character. So, you know, very often, Trevor Nunn is this way, a lot of wonderful\ndirectors I've worked with, they're really good at\nhelping you trim and edit. - David Fincher said about you, he was talking in general, I think, but also specifically in the\nmoment of \"House of Cards,\" said that you have exceptional\nskill, both as an actor and as a performer, which he\nsays are different things. So he defines the former\nas dramatization of a text and the latter as the\nseduction of an audience. Do you see wisdom in that distinction? And what does it take to\ndo both, the dramatization of a text and the\nseduction of an audience? - Those are two very\ninteresting descriptions. I guess, when I think performer, I tend to think entertaining. I tend to think comedy. I tend to think winning over an audience. I tend to think there's something about that quality of wanting to\nhave people enjoy themselves. And when you saddle that against what maybe he means as an actor, which is more dramatic\nor more text driven... Look, I've always believed that my job, not every actor feels this way, but my job, the way that\nI've looked at it, is that my job is to serve the writing. And that if I serve the writing, I will in a sense serve myself, because I'll be in the right world, I'll be in the right context, I'll be in the right style. I'll have embraced what a director's... You know, it's not my painting, it's someone else's painting. I'm a series of colors in\nsomeone else's painting. And the barometer for\nme has always been that when people stop me and talk to me about a\ncharacter I've played and reference their name\nas if they actually exist, that's when I feel like I've\ngotten close to doing my job. - Yeah, one of the challenges for me in this conversation is remembering that your name is Kevin, not Frank or John or any of these characters, because they live deeply in the psyche. - To me, that's the greatest compliment for me as an actor. I love being able to go. I mean, when I think about performers who inspire me, and I remember when I was young and I was introduced to Spencer Tracy, Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn, I believed who they were. I knew nothing about them. They were just these\nextraordinary characters doing this extraordinary stuff. And then I think more\nrecently contemporary, when I think of the work that\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman did and Heath Ledger and people that when I think about what they could be doing,\nwhat they could do, what they would've done\nhad they stayed with us. I'm so excited when I go into a cinema or I go into a play and I completely am taken to someplace that I believe exists and\ncharacters that become real. - And those characters become\nlike lifelong companions. Like for me, they travel with you. And even if it's the darkest aspects of human nature, they're always there. I feel like I almost met them and gotten to know them and gotten to become like\nfriends with them almost. Hannibal Lecter or Forrest Gump, I mean, I feel like I'm like\nbest friends with Forrest Gump. I know the guy and I guess he's played\nby some guy named Tom, but like Forrest Gump is\nthe guy I'm friends with. And I think that everybody feels like that when they're in the audience\nwith great characters. They just kind of, become\npart of you in some way, the good, the bad, and the ugly of them. - One of the things that I feel that I try to do in my work is when I read something for the first time when I read a script or play, and I am absolutely devastated by it. It is the most extraordinary,\nthe most beautiful, the most life-affirming or terrifying, it's then a process weirdly\nof working backwards because I wanna work in such a way that that's the experience\nI give to the audience when they first see it, that they have the experience\nI had when I read it. I remember that there's been\ntimes in the creative process when something was pointed out to me or something was... I remember I was doing a play and I was having this really tough time with one of the last scenes in the play and I just couldn't figure it out and I was in rehearsal and although we had a\ndirector in that play, I called another, a friend\nof mine who was also director and I had him come over. And I said, \"Look, this scene,\nI'm just having the toughest, I cannot seem to crack this scene.\" And so we read it\nthrough a couple of times and then this wonderful\ndirector named John Swanbeck who would eventually direct me in a film called \"The Big\nKahuna,\" but this is before that. He said to me the most incredible thing. He just said, \"All right,\nwhat's the last line you have in this scene before you\nfall over and fall asleep?\" And I said, \"The last line is, 'That last drink, the old KO.'\" And he went, \"Okay, I\nwant you to think about what that line actually means\nand then work backwards.\" And so he left and I sort of was left with this, \"What? Like, what does that mean? How am I supposed to?\" And then like a couple of days went by, a couple of days went by and I\nthought, okay, so I see that, what does that line actually mean? \"Well, that last drink, the old KO.\" KO is knockout, which is a boxing term. It's the only boxing term\nthe writer uses in the play. And then I went back and I realized my friend was so smart and so incredible to, you know, said, \"Ask a question you haven't\nthought of asking yet.\" I realized that the playwright\nwrote the last round, the eighth round between\nthese two brothers and it was a fight, physical\nas well as emotional. And when I brought that\ninto the rehearsal room to the directors doing that\nplay, he liked that idea and we staged that scene as\nif it was the eighth round, although audience\nwouldn't have known that. But just what I loved about that was that somebody said to me,\n\"Ask yourself a question you haven't asked yourself yet. What does that line mean\nand then work backwards.\" - What is that like a catalyst for thinking deeply about what is magical about this play,\nthis story, this narrative? That's what that is. Like thinking backwards,\nthat's what that does. - Yeah, but also because\nit's this incredible, why didn't I think to\nask that question myself? That's what you have directors for. That's why you have, you know, so many places where ideas can come from, but that just illustrates that even though in my brain I go, I always\nlike to work backwards, I missed it in that one, and I'm very grateful to my friend for having pushed me into being able to realize what that meant. - To ask the interesting question. I like the poetry and the humility of, \"I'm just a series of colors\nin someone else's painting.\" That was a good line. That said, you've talked\nabout improvisation. You said that it's all about the ability to do it again and again and again, and yet never make it the same. And you also just said that you're trying to stay true to the text. So where's the room for the improvisation that it's never the same? - Well, there's two slightly\ndifferent contexts, I think. One is in the rehearsal room, improvisation could be a wonderful device. I mean, Sam Mendes for\nexample, he'll start a scene and he does this wonderful thing. He brings rugs and he\nbrings chairs and sofas in and he says, \"Well, let's\nput two chairs here and here. You guys, let's start in these chairs far apart from each other. Let's see what happens with the scene if you're that far apart.\" And so we'll do the scene that way. And then he goes, \"Okay,\nlet's bring a rug in and let's bring these chairs much closer and let's see what happens if the space between you is...\" And so then you try it that way. And then, you know, it's a little harder in Shakespeare improv, but in any situation where you wanna try and see where could a scene go. Where would the scene go if\nI didn't make that choice? Where would the scene go\nif I made this choice? Where would the scene\ngo if I didn't say that or I said something else? So that's how improv can\nbe a valuable process to learn about limits and boundaries and what's going on with a character that somehow you discover in trying something\nthat isn't on the page. Then there's the different thing, which is the trying to make it fresh and trying to make it new and that is really a reference to theater. I'll put it to you this way. Anybody loves sports, right? So you go and you watch on a pitch, you watch a tennis game,\nyou watch basketball, you watch football. Yeah, the rules are the same, but it's a different game\nevery time you're out on that court or on that field. It's no different in theater. Yes, it's the same lines,\nmaybe even blocking is similar, but what's different is attack, intention, how you are growing in a role and watching your fellow\nactors grow in theirs and how every night it's a new audience and they're reacting differently. And literally, where you can go from week one of performances in a play to week 12 is extraordinary. And the difference between\ntheater and film is that no matter how good\nsomeone might think you are in a movie, you'll never\nbe any better, it's frozen. Whereas I can be better tomorrow\nnight than I was tonight. I can be better in a\nweek than I was tonight. It is a living, breathing,\nshifting, changing, growing thing every single day. - But also in theater,\nthere's no safety net. If you fuck it up, everybody\ngets to see you do that. - And if you start giggling\non stage, everyone gets to see you do that too,\nwhich I am very guilty of. - I mean, there is something of a seduction of an audience in theater even more intense than there is when you're talking about film. I got a chance to watch the documentary \"Now in the Wings on a World Stage,\" which is behind the scenes of, you mentioned you teaming\nup with Sam Mendes in 2011 to stage \"Richard III,\" a\nplay by William Shakespeare. I was also surprised to learn you haven't\nreally done Shakespeare, or at least you said that in the movie, but there's a lot of interesting\nbehind-the-scenes stuff there. First of all, the comradery of everybody, how like the bond theater creates, especially when you're traveling. But another interesting\nthing you mentioned with the chairs of Sam Mendes\ntrying different stuff, it seemed like everybody was\nreally open to trying stuff, embarrassing themselves,\ntaking risks, all of that. I suppose that's part\nof acting in general, but theater especially. Just take risks, it's okay to embarrass\nthe shit outta yourself including the director. - And it's also because\nyou become a family. You know, it's unlike a movie where, you know, I might have a scene with so and so on this day and then another scene with\nthem in a week and a half and then that's the only scenes we have in the whole movie together. Every single day when you\nshow up in the rehearsal room, it's the whole company. You're all up for it every day. You're learning, you're\ngrowing, you're trying and there is an incredible\ntrust that happens. And I was of course fortunate that some of the things I learned and\nobserved about being a part of that family, being\nincluded in that family and being a part of creating\nthat family, I was able to observe from people like Jack Lemmon who led many companies that\nI was fortunate to work in and be a part of. - There's also a sad moment where at the end everybody\nis really sad to say goodbye 'cause you do form a\nfamily and then it's over. I guess somebody said that\nthat's just part of theater. It's like, I mean, there's\na kind of assumed goodbye and that this is it. - Yeah and also there are sometimes when like six months later\nI'll wake up in the middle of the night and I'll go, ah,\nthat's how to play that scene. Oh God, I just finally\nfigured it out. (laughs) - So maybe you could speak\na little bit more to that. What's the difference between film acting and live theater acting? - I don't really think there is any. I think there's just, you eventually learn\nabout yourself on film. You know, when I first\ndid like my first episode of \"The Equalizer,\" you know, it's horrible. It's just so bad. But I didn't know that about myself. So slowly begin to learn about yourself but I think good acting is good acting and I think that, you know, if a camera's right here, you know that your front row is also your back row. You don't have to do so much. There is in theater, a\nparticular kind of energy, almost like an athlete\nthat you have to have, vocally to be able to get\nup seven performances a week and never lose your voice and always be there and always be alive and always be doing the best work you can that you just don't require in film. You know, you don't have to have the same, it just doesn't require\nthe same kind of stamina that doing a play does. - It just feels like\nalso in theater you have to become the character more intensely because you can't take a break, you can't take a bathroom break, and you're like, on stage, there's no, this is you. - Yeah but you have no\nidea what's going on stage with the actors. I mean, I have literally\nlaughed through speeches that I had to give because my fellow actors were\nputting carrots up their nose or broccoli in their ears or doing whatever they were\ndoing to make me laugh. - So they're just having fun? - They're having the time of their life. And by the way, Judi Dench\nis the worst giggler of all. I mean, they had to bring\nthe curtain down on her and Maggie Smith because\nthey were laughing so hard they could not continue the play. - So even when you're doing\nlike a dramatic monologue, they're still fucking with you. - They're still fucking. (laughs) - Okay, that's great. Yeah, that's good to know. You also said an interesting line that improvisation helps you\nlearn about the character. Can you explain that? So like, through maybe playing\nwith the different ways of saying the words or the different ways to bring the words to life, you\nget to learn about yourself, about the character you're playing. - It can be helpful but improv is... I'm such a big believer in the writing and in serving the writing and doing the words the writer wrote, that improv for me, unless\nyou're just doing like comedy and you know, like, I mean I love improv in comedy, it's brilliant. So much fun to watch people just come up with something right there. But, you know, that's where\nyou're looking for laughs and you're specifically in a little scene that's being created. But I think improv has had value, but I have not experienced\nit as much in doing plays as I have sometimes in doing film where you'll start off rehearsing and a director may say, \"Let's just go off book\nand see what happens.\" And I've had moments in film\nwhere someone went off book and it was terrifying. There was a scene I had\nin \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" where the character I play\nhas fucked something up. He's just screwed something\nup and Pacino is livid. And so we had the scene\nwhere Al is walking like this and the camera is moving with him and he is shoeing me a new asshole. And in the middle of the take, Al starts talking about me. \"Oh Kevin, you don't think\nwe know how you got this job? You don't think we know whose\ndick you've been sucking on to get this part in this movie?\" And now, I'm literally like, I don't know what the hell is happening,\nbut I'm reacting. We got to the end of that take. Al walked up to me and he\nwent, \"Oh, that was so good. Oh my God, that was so good. Just so you know, the sound,\nI asked them not to record, so you have no dialogue so it's just me. Oh, that was so good. You look like a car wreck.\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" And it was actually an\nincredibly generous thing that he gave me so that I would react. - Oh wow. Did they use that shot? because you were in the shot?\n- That's the take. It was my closeup. And yeah, that's the take. - That was an intense scene. I mean, what was it like, if we can just linger on that, just that intense scene with Al Pacino? - Well, he's the reason I got the movie. A lot of people might think\nbecause Jack was in the film, that he had something to do with it. But actually I was doing a play called \"Lost in Yonkers\" on Broadway. And we had the same dresser\nwho worked with him, a girl named Laura who was\nwonderful, Laura Beatty. And she told Al that he\nshould come and see this play because she wanted to see me in this play. I was playing this gangster,\nfun, fun, fun part. So I didn't know Pacino came\non some night and saw this play and then like three days\nlater, I got a call to come in and audition for this\n\"Glengarry Glen Ross,\" which of course I knew as\na play, David Mamet's play. And then I auditioned,\nJamie Foley was the director who would eventually direct a bunch of \"House of Cards,\" wonderful guy. And I got the part. Well, I didn't quite get the part. They were gonna bring together the actors that they thought they were\ngonna give the parts to on a Saturday at Al's office. And they asked me if I would\ncome and do a read through and I said, \"Who's gonna be there?\" And they said, well, so and\nso and so and so and so, and Jack Lemmon is flying in. And I said, \"Don't tell Mr. Lemmon that I'm doing the read through. Is that possible?\" And they were like, \"Sure.\" So I'll never forget this. Jack was sitting in a chair in Pacino's office doing the\nNew York Times crossword puzzle as he did every day like this. And I walked in the door and\nhe went, \"Oh, Jesus Christ. Is it possible you could\nget a job without me? Jesus Christ, I'm so tired\nof holding up your end of it. Oh my God, Jesus.\" So I got the job job because of Al Pacino. And, you know, it was really\none of the first major roles that I ever had in a film and, you know, to be\nworking with that group. - Yeah, that's like one of the\ngreatest ensemble cast ever. We got Al Pacino, Jack\nLemmon, Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris,\nyou, Jonathan Pryce. It's just incredible. And I have to say, I mean\nmaybe you can comment, you've talked about how much of a mentor and a friend Jack Lemmon has been. That's one of his greatest\nperformances ever. - Ever. - You have a scene at the end of the movie with him that was really powerful. It's like firing on all cylinders. You're playing disdain to perfection and he's playing\ndesperation to perfection. What a scene. What was that like? just like at the top of\nyour game, the two of you? - Well, by that time we had done \"Long Day's Journey Into\nNight\" in the theater. We'd done a mini series called \"The Murder of Mary Phagan\" on NBC. We'd done a film called \"Dad\" that Gary David Goldberg\ndirected with Ted Danson. So this was the fourth time\nwe were working together and we knew each other. He'd become my father figure. And I don't know if you know that I originally met Jack Lemmon when I was very, very young. He was doing a production\nat the Mark Taper Forum of a Sean O'Casey play\ncalled \"Juno and The Paycock\" with Walter Matthau and Maureen Stapleton. And on a Saturday, in December of 1974, my junior high school drama\nclass went to a workshop. It was called How to Audition. And we did this workshop, many schools in southern\nCalifornia were part of this drama association so we got these incredible experiences of being able to go see\nprofessional productions and be involved in these\nworkshops or festivals. So I had to get up and do a monologue in front of Mr. Lemmon\nwhen I was 13 years old. And he walked up to me at the end of that and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said, \"That was\njust actually terrific.\" He said, \"No, I mean, everything\nI've been talking about, you just did. Yeah, what what's your name?\" I said, \"Kevin.\" He said, \"Well, lemme tell you something, when you get finished with high school, I'm sure you're gonna\ngo on and do theater, you should go to New York and you should study to be an actor 'cause this is what you're\nmeant to do with your life.\" - And he was like an idol and 12 years later, I\nread in the New York Times that he was coming to\nBroadway to do this production of a \"Long Day's Journey Into\nNight,\" a year and some months after I read this article and I was like, I'm gonna\nplay Jamie in that production. And I then, with a lot of opposition, because the casting directors\ndidn't wanna see me. They said that the director, Jonathan Miller wanted movie\nactors to play the two sons. And ultimately, I found out that Jonathan Miller,\nthe director, was coming to New York to do a series of\nlectures at Alice Tully Hall. And I went to try to figure\nout how I could maybe meet him. And I was sitting in\nthat theater listening to this incredible lecture he was doing and sitting next to me\nwas an elderly woman, and I mean elderly, 80 something, and she was asleep, but sticking out of her handbag, which was on the floor was a invitation to a cocktail reception in\nhonor of Dr. Jonathan Miller. And so I thought, you know, she's tired, she's probably gonna go home. So I took that and walked\ninto this cocktail reception and ultimately went over to Dr. Miller, who was incredibly kind and said, \"Sit down now. I'm always very curious what brings young people to my lectures.\" And I said to him, \"Eugene\nO'Neill brought me here.\" And he was like, \"What? I've\nalways wanted to meet him. Where is he?\" And I told him that I'd\nbeen trying for seven months to get an audition for\na Long Day's Journey and that his American cast\ndirectors were telling my agents that he wanted big American movie stars. And at that moment he turned and he saw one of those casting directors who was there that night, because I knew he was gonna be in New York starting auditions that week and she was staring daggers\nat me and he just got it. And he said, \"Someone have a pen?\" And he took the little\npaper, started writing. He said, \"Listen, Kevin,\nthere are many situations in which casting directors\nhave a lot of say and a lot of power and a lot of leverage and then there are other situations where they just take director's messages and on this one they're\ntaking my messages. This is where I'm staying. Make sure your people get to me. We start auditions on Thursday.\" And on Thursday, I had an opportunity to come in and audition for this play that I've been working on and preparing. And at the end of it, I did four scenes. At the end of it, he said to me that unless someone else came in and blew him against the\nwall, like I had just done as far as he was concerned,\nI pretty much had the part but I couldn't tell my agents that yet 'cause I had to come back\nand read with Mr. Lemmon. And so three months later in August of 1985, I\nfound myself in a room with Jack Lemmon again at 890 Broadway, which is where they rehearsed\na lot of the Broadway plays and we did four scenes together. And I was toppling over\nhim, I was pushing him, I was relentless. And I'll never forget, at the end of that, Lemmon came over to me, he\nput his hand on my shoulder and he said, \"That was\na touch of terrific. I never thought we'd find the rotten kid, but Jesus Christ, what the hell was that?\" And I ended up spending the next year of my life with that man. - So it turns out he was right. - Yeah. - This world works in mysterious ways. It also speaks to the fact of the power of somebody you look up to\ngiving words of encouragement 'cause those can just reverberate\nthrough your whole life and just like make the path clear. - We used to joke that\nif every contract came with a Jack Lemmon clause, it would be a more beautiful world. - Beautifully said. Jack Lemmon is one of\nthe greatest actors ever. What do you think makes him so damn good? - Wow. I think he truly set out in his life to accomplish what his father\nsaid to him on his deathbed. His father was by the way,\ncalled the Donut King in Boston and not in the entertainment\nbusiness at all. He literally owned a donut company. And when he was passing away, Jack said, \"The last thing\nmy father said to me was, 'Go out there and spread\na little sunshine.'\" And I truly think that's\nwhat Jack loved to do. I remember this and I don't know if this will answer your question, but I think it's revealing\nabout what he's able to do and what he was able to do and how that ultimately\ninfluenced what I was able to do. Sam Mendes had never directed a film before \"American Beauty.\" And so what he did was he took\nthe best elements of theater and applied them to the process. So we rehearsed it like\na play in a sound stage where everything was laid out\nlike it would be in a play and this couch will be here. And he'd sent me a couple of tapes. He'd sent me a two cassette tapes, one that he'd like to call pre-Lester before he begins to move in the direction and then post-Lester and they\njust were different songs. And then he said to me one day, and I think always\nthought this was brilliant of Sam to use Lemmon, knowing\nwhat Lemmon meant to me. He said, \"When was the last time you watched 'The Apartment?'\" And I said, \"I don't know. I mean, I love that movie so much.\" He goes, \"I want you to watch\nit again and then let's talk.\" So I went and I watched the movie again and we sat down and Sam said, \"What Lemmon does in\nthat film is incredible because there is never\na moment in the movie where we see him change. He just evolves. And he becomes the man he becomes because of the experiences that he has through the course of the film. But there's this remarkable\nconsistency in who he becomes and that's what I need\nyou to do as Lester. I don't want the audience\nto ever see him change. I want him to evolve.\" And so we did some... I mean, first of all it\nwas just a great direction. And then second of all, we did some things that people don't know we did to aid that gradual shift\nof that man's character. First of all, I had to\nbe in the best shape from the beginning of the movie 'cause we didn't shoot it in sequence. So I was in this crazy shape. I had this wonderful\ntrainer named Mike Tosher, who just was incredible. But so what we did was, in order to then show\nthis gradual shift was I had three different hair pieces, I had three different kinds of costumes of different colors and sizes, and I had different makeup. So in the beginning I was wearing a kind of drab, dull, slightly, you\nknow, uninspired hairpiece and my makeup was kind of gray and boring. And I was a little bit, there were times when I was\nlike, too much like this and Sam would go, \"Kevin,\nyou look like Walter Matthau. Would you please stand up a little bit?\" We're sort of midway\nthrough at this point. And then at a certain\npoint the wig changed and it had little highlights\nin it, a little more color, a little more, the makeup became a little, the suits got a little tighter. And then finally a third wig\nthat was golden highlights and sunshine and you know,\nrosy cheeks and tight fit. And these are what we\ncall theatrical tricks. You know, this is how you... An audience doesn't even\nknow it's happening, but it is this gradual... And I just always felt that that was such a brilliant way because he knew what I felt about Jack. And when you watch \"The\nApartment,\" it is extraordinary that he doesn't ever change. And in fact I thanked Jack when I won the Oscar and I did my thank you speech and I walked off stage and I remember I had to\nsit down for a moment because I didn't want\nto go to the press room because I wanted to see\nif Sam was gonna win. And so I was waiting and my phone rang and it was Lemmon. He said, \"You're a son of a bitch.\" I said, \"What?\" He goes, \"First of all, congratulations and thanks for thanking me 'cause, you know, God knows you couldn't\nhave done it without me.\" He said, \"Second of all,\" he said, \"Do you know how long it took me to\nwin from supporting actor? I won it for \"Mister Roberts\" and it took me like 10,\n12 years to win the Oscar. You did it in four, you son of a bitch.\" - Yeah, \"The Apartment,\" I\nmean, it's widely considered one of the greatest movies ever. People sometimes refer to it as a comedy, which is an interesting\nkind of classification. I suppose that's a lesson about comedy that the best comedy is the\none that's basically a tragedy. - Well, I mean, some people think \"Clockwork Orange\" is a comedy, and I'm not saying there\naren't some good laughs in \"Clockwork Orange\" but\nyeah, you know, it's... - I mean, yeah. What's that line between\ncomedy and tragedy for you? - Well, if it's a line, it's a line I cross all the time because I've tried always to find the humor unexpected sometimes, maybe inappropriate\nsometimes, maybe shocking. But I've tried in I think almost every\ndramatic role I've had to have a sense of humor and to be able to bring that along with everything else that is serious. Because frankly, that's how we deal with stuff in life, you know. - I think Sam Mendes actually said in the Now documentary, something like, \"With great theater, with\ngreat stories, you find humor on the journey to the heart of darkness,\" something like this. Very poetic, it stood out to me but it's true. - I'm sorry I can't be that poetic. I'm very sorry. - But it's true. I mean, the people I've interacted with in this world that have\nbeen to a war zone, and the ones who have lost the most and have suffered the\nmost are usually the ones who are able to make jokes the quickest. And the jokes are often dark and absurd and cross every single line. No political correctness, all of that. - Sure. Well, I mean, you know, it's like the great\n\"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" where they can't stop giggling\nat at the clown's funeral. I mean, it's just one of\nthe great episodes ever. You know, giggling at a funeral is as bad as farting at a funeral. And, you know, I'm sure\nthat there's some people who have done both. - Oh man, so you mentioned\n\"American Beauty\" and the idea of not\nchanging, but evolving. That's really interesting because that movie is about\nlike finding yourself. It's a philosophically profound movie. It's about various characters in their own ways,\nfinding their own identity in a world where a materialistic system that wants you to be like everyone else. And so, I mean, Lester\nreally transforms himself throughout the movie. And you're saying the challenge there is to still be the same\nhuman being fundamentally. - Yeah, and I also think\nthat the film was powerful because you had three very honest and genuine portrayal of young people. And then you had Lester\nbehaving like a young person, doing things that were unexpected. And I think that the honesty with which it dealt with those issues that those teenagers were going through, and the honesty with which it dealt with what Lester was going\nthrough, I think are some of the reasons why the film\nhad the response that it did from so many people. I mean, I used to get stopped and someone would say to me, \"When I first saw 'American\nBeauty,' I was married, and the second time I saw it, I wasn't.\" And I was like, \"Well, we weren't trying to increase the divorce rate. You know, it wasn't our intention.\" But it is interesting how so many people have those kinds of crazy fantasies. And what I admired so much about who Lester was as a person,\nwhy I wanted to play him is because in the end, he\nmakes the right decision. - I think a lot of people live\nlives of quiet desperation in a job they don't like, in a marriage they're unhappy in and to see somebody living that life and then saying fuck it\nin every way possible, and not just in a cynical way, but in a way that opens\nthem, opens Lester up to see the beauty in the world. That's, you know, the\nbeauty in \"American Beauty.\" - Well, and you know, you may\nhave to blackmail your boss to get there, but, you know. - And in that, there's\na bunch of humor also in the anger and in the absurdity of sort of taking a stand\nagainst the conformity of life, there's this humor. And I read somewhere that\nthe scene, the dinner scene, which is kind of play like where Lester slams the plate against the wall was improvised by you, the slamming of the\nplate against the wall. - No, absolutely. - [Lex] The internet lies once again. - Absolutely written and directed. Yeah, can't take credit for that. - The plate, okay. Well, that was a genius interaction there. There's something about the dinner table and losing your shit at the dinner table, having a fight and losing your shit at the dinner table. Where else? Like \"Yellowstone\" was another situation where it's a family at the dinner table and then one of them says, \"Fuck it, I'm not eating this anymore and I'm going to create a scene.\" - [Kevin] Right. - It's a beautiful kind of\nenvironment for dramatic scenes. - Or Nicholson in \"The Shining.\" I mean, there's some\nfamily scenes gone awry in that movie. - The contrast between\nyou and Annette Bening in that scene creates\nthe genius of that scene. So how much of acting is the\ndance between two actors? - Well, with Annette, I just\nadored working with her. And we were the two actors that Sam wanted from the very beginning, much against the will of the higher ups who wanted other actors\nto play those roles. But I've known Annette since we did a screen test\ntogether for Milos Forman for a film he did of the \"Les\nLiaisons dangereuses\" movie. It was a different film from that one, but it was the same story. And I've always thought,\nshe's just remarkable. And I think that the work\nshe did in that film, the relationship that\nwe were able to build, for me, the saddest\npart of that success was that she didn't win the Oscar and I felt she should have. - What kind of interesting\ndirection did you get from Sam Mendes in how you\napproach playing Lester in how to take on the different scenes? There's a lot of just\nbrilliant scenes in that movie. - Well, I'll share with you a story that most people don't know, which is our first two\ndays of shooting were in Smiley's, the place where I get a job in a fast food place. - [Lex] Yeah, it's a burger joint. Yeah. - And I guess it was\nlike maybe the third day or the fourth day of\nshooting, we'd now done that and I said to Sam, \"So\nhow are the dailies? You know, how do they look?\" He goes, \"Which ones?\" I said, \"Well, the first smileys.\" He goes, \"Oh, they're shit.\" And I went, \"Yeah, no, how are they?\" He goes, \"No, they're shit. I hate them. I hate everything about them. I hate the costumes, I hate the location. I hate that you're inside.\nI hate the way you acted. I hate everything but the script. So I've gone back to the studio and asked them if we can\nreshoot the first two days.\" And it was like, \"Sam, this\nis your very first movie. You're going back to Steven Spielberg and saying I need to reshoot\nthe first two days entirely?\" And he went, \"Yeah.\" And that's exactly what we did. A couple of weeks later they decided that it was now a drive-through, because Annette and Peter\nGallagher used to come into the place and\nordered from the counter. Now, Sam had decided it\nhas to be a drive-through. You have to be in the\nwindow of the drive-through, change the costumes and we\nre-shot those first two days. And Sam said it was actually a moment of incredible confidence because he said the worst thing that could possibly\nhave happened, happened in my first two days. And after that I was like,\nI know what I'm doing and I knew I had to reshoot it and it was absolutely right. - And I guess that's what a\ngreat director must do, is have the guts in that moment\nto reshoot everything. I mean, that's a pretty gutsy move. - I got two other little things to share with you about Sam, about the way he is. You wouldn't know it but the original script opened\nand closed with a trial. Ricky was accused of Lester's murder and the movie was bookended by this trial. - It's a very different movie, - Which they shot the\nentire trial for weeks. And I used to fly in my dreams, you know, those opening\nshots over the neighborhood. I used to come into those shots in my bathrobe, flying, and\nthen when I hit the ground and the newspaper was thrown\nat me by the newspaper guy and I caught it, the alarm would go off and I wake up in bed. I spent five days being hung by wires and filming these sequences\nof flying through my dreams. And Sam said to me, \"Yeah, the\nflying sequences are all gone and the trial is gone.\" And I was like, \"What? What\nare you talking about?\" And here's my other little\nfavorite story about Sam and when we were shooting in the valley, one of those places I flew,\nthis was an indoor set, Sam said to me in the morning, \"Hey, at lunch I just\nwanna record a guide track of all the dialogue, all of your narration 'cause they just needed\nan editing as a guide.\" And I said, \"Sure.\" So I remember we came\noutside in this hallway where I had a dressing room in this little studio we were in and Sam had like a cassette tape recorder and like a little microphone and we put it on the floor\nand he pushed record. And I read the entire narration and I never did it again. That's the narration in the movie, because Sam said when he listened to it, I wasn't trying to do anything. He said, \"You had no idea\nwhere these things were going, where they were gonna be placed,\nwhat they were gonna mean. You just read it so innocently,\nso purely, so directly that I knew if I brought you into a studio and put headphones on you and had you do it again,\nit would change the ease with which you'd done it.\" And so they just fixed all of the problems that they had with this little cassette. And that is the way I did it and the only time I did it\nwas in this little hallway. - And once again, a great\nperformance lies in doing less. The innocence and the purity of Lester. - He knew I would've come into\nthe studio and fucked it up. - Yeah, what do you think about the notion of beauty that permeates\n\"American Beauty?\" What do you think that\ntheme is with the roses, with the rose petals, the characters that are living this\nmundane existence slowly opening their eyes up to\nwhat is beautiful in life? - See, it's funny, I\ndon't think of the roses and I don't think of\nher body in the poster, and I don't think of those\nthings as the beauty. I think of the bag. I think that there are things we miss that are right in front of us that are truly beautiful. - The little things, the simple things. - Yeah and in fact, I'll\neven tell you something that I always thought was so incredible. When we shot the scenes in the office where Lester worked the job he hated, there was a bulletin\nboard behind me on a wall. And someone who was watching\na cut or early dailies who was in the marketing department saw that someone had cut out\na little piece of paper and stuck it and it said, \"Look closer.\" And they presented that to Sam as the idea of that could go on the poster. The idea of looking closer\nwas such a brilliant idea, but I mean, it wasn't in the script, it was just on a wall behind me and someone happened to\nzoom in on it and see it and thought that's what\nthis movie's about. This movie's about taking\nthe time to look closer. And I think that in\nitself is just beautiful. - Mortality also permeates the film. You know, it starts with acknowledging that death is on the way that Lester's time is finite. You ever think about your own death? - Yeah, yeah. - [Lex] Scared of it? - When I was at my lowest\npoint, yes, it scared me. - What does that fear look like? What's the nature of the fear? What are you afraid of? - That there's no way out. That there's no answer. That nothing makes sense. - See, the interesting thing about Lester is facing the same fear, he seemed to be somehow liberated\nand accepted everything and then saw the beauty of it. - Because he got there. He was given the opportunity\nto reinvent himself and to try things he'd never tried, to ask questions he'd never asked, to trust his instincts and to become the best version\nof himself he could become. And so Dick Van Dyke who has become an\nextraordinary friend of mine, Dick is 98 years old, and he says, you know, \"If I'd known I was gonna live this long, I would've taken better care of myself.\" When I spend time with him, I'm just moved by every day. You know, he gets up and he goes, \"It's a good day. I woke up.\" And I learn a lot about... I have a different feeling about death now than I did seven years ago. And I am on the path to\nbeing able to be in a place where I've resolved the\nthings I needed to resolve and won't probably get to\nall of it in my lifetime, but I certainly would like\nto be at a place where if I were to drop dead tomorrow, it would've been an amazing life. - So Lester got there. It sounds like Dick Van Dyke got there. You're trying to get there. - Sure. - You said you feared\ndeath at your lowest point. What was the lowest point? - It was November 1st, 2017, and then Thanksgiving\nday of that same year. - So let's talk about it. Let's\ntalk about this dark time. Let's talk about the sexual\nallegations against you that led to you being canceled by, well, the entire world\nfor the last seven years. I would like to personally\nunderstand the sins, the bad things you did, and\nthe bad things you didn't do. So I also should say that the\nthing I hope to do here is to give respect to due process, innocent until proven guilty that the mass hysteria\nmachine of the internet and clickbait journalism doesn't do. So here's what I understand. They were criminal and civil\ntrials brought against you, including the one that started it all when Anthony Rapp sued\nyou for $40 million. In these trials, you were\nacquitted, found not guilty, and not liable. Is that right?\n- Yes. - I think that's really important, again, in terms of due process. And I read a lot and I watched a lot in preparation\nfor this, on this point, including, of course, the\nrecently detailed interviews you did with Dan Wootton and then Allison Pearson of the Telegraph and those are all focused on this topic, and they go in detail\nwhere you respond in detail to many of the allegations. If people are interested in the details, they can listen to those. So based on that, and\neverything I looked at, as I understand, you never\nprevented anyone from leaving if they wanted to, sort\nof in a sexual context, for example, by blocking the door. Is that right? - That's correct. Yeah. - You always respected the\nexplicit no from people, again in the sexual context. Is that right? - That is correct. - You've never done anything sexual with an underage person, right? - Never. - And also, as it's sometimes done in Hollywood, let me ask this. You've never explicitly offered\nto exchange sexual favors for career advancement, correct? - Correct. - In terms of bad\nbehavior, what did you do? What was the worst of it,\nand how often did you do it? - I have heard, and now quite often, that everybody has a Kevin Spacey story and what that tells me is\nthat I hit on a lot of guys. - How often did you cross the line and what does that mean to you? - I did a lot of horsing\naround and a lot of things that at the time I thought\nwere sort of playful and fun and I have learned since were not. And I have had to recognize\nthat I crossed some boundaries and I did some things that were wrong, and I made some mistakes and that's in my past. I mean, I've been working so hard over these last seven years to have the conversations\nI needed to have, to listen to people, to understand things from\na different perspective than the one that I had and to say, I will never\nbehave that way again for the rest of my life. - Just to clarify, I think\nyou are often too pushy with the flirting, and that manifests itself in multiple ways but just to make clear, you never prevented anyone\nfrom leaving if they wanted to. You always took the\nexplicit no from people as an answer, \"No, stop,\"\nyou took that for the answer. You've never done anything\nsexual with an underage person, and you've never explicitly offered to exchange sexual favors\nfor career advancement. These are some of the sort of accusations that have been made. And in the court of law, multiple\ntimes have been shown not to be true. - But I have had a sexual\nlife and I've fallen in love, and I've been so admiring\nof people that... I mean, I'm so romantic. I'm such a romantic person that there's this whole side of me that hasn't been talked\nabout, isn't being discussed but that's who I know, that's the person I know. It's been very upsetting to hear that some people have said, I mean, I don't have a\nviolent bone in my body, but to hear people describe things as having been very aggressive is incredibly difficult for me. And I'm deeply sorry that\nI ever offended anyone or hurt anyone in any way. It is crushing to me, and\nI have to work very hard to show and to prove that I\nhave learned, I got the memo and I will never, ever, ever\nbehave in those ways again. - From everything I've\nseen in public interactions with you, people love you. Colleagues love you, coworkers love you. There's a flirtatiousness. Another word for that is chemistry. There's a chemistry between\nthe people you work with. - And by the way, not\nto take anything away from my accountability for things I did, where I got it wrong, I crossed the line, I pushed some boundaries. I accept all of that but I live in an industry in which flirtation,\nattraction, people meeting in the workspace and ending\nup marrying each other and having children and so it is a space and a place where these notions of family,\nthese notions of attraction, these notions of... It's always complicated if you\nmeet someone in the workspace and find yourselves\nattracted to each other. You have to be mindful of that. And you have to be very mindful that you don't ever want anyone to feel that their job is in jeopardy, or you would punish them in some way if they no longer wanted to be with you. So those are important\nthings to just acknowledge. - Another complexity to\nthis, as I've seen, is that there's just a huge number of actors that look up to you, a\nhuge number of people in the industry that look\nup to you and love you. I've seen just from this documentary, just a lot of people just\nlove being around you, learning from you what it means to create great theater,\ngreat film, great stories. And so that adds to the complexity. I wouldn't say it's a power dynamic like a boss-employee relationship. It's a admiration dynamic that is easy to miss and\neasy to take advantage of. Is that something you understand? - Yes, and I also understand\nthat there are people who met me and spent a very\nbrief period of time with me, but presume I was now\ngoing to be their mentor and then behaved in a way\nthat I was unaware of, that they were either\nparticipating or flirting along or encouraging me without\nme having any idea that at the end of the day,\nthey were expecting something. So these are about relationships, and these are about two people. These are about people making decisions, people making choices and I accept my accountability in that. But there are a number of\nthings that I've been accused of that just simply did not happen. And I can't say, and I don't think it would\nbe right for me to say, well, you know, everything that's ever been I've\nbeen accused of is true because we've now proved\nthat it isn't and it wasn't. But I'm perfectly willing to\naccept that I had behaviors that were wrong and that\nI shouldn't have done and I am regretful for. - I think that's also speaks\nto a dark side of fame. The sense I got is that\nthere are some people, potentially a lot of people\ntrying to make friends with you in order to get roles, in order to advance their career. So not you using them, but\nthey trying to use you. What's that like? How do you know if somebody\nlikes you for you, for Kevin, or likes you for... Like you said you're a\nromantic, you see a person and you're like, I like this person, and they seem to like you. How do you know if they like you for you? - Well, to some degree, I\nwould say that I have been able to trust my instincts on that and now that I've, most\nof the time been right. But obviously in the last number of years, not just with people who've accused me, but just also people in\nmy own industry, you know, to realize that, oh, I\nthought we had a friendship, but I guess that was about an inch thick and not what I thought it was. But look, you know, one\nshouldn't be surprised by that. I have to also say, you know,\nyou said a little while ago that the world had canceled me and I have to disagree with you. I have to disagree because for seven years I've been stopped by people, sometimes every day,\nsometimes multiple times a day and the conversations\nthat I have with people, the generosity that they share,\nthe kindness that they show and how much they wanna know\nwhen I'm getting back to work, tells me that while there\nmay be a very loud minority, there is a quieter majority. - In the industry, have you been betrayed? In life? And how do you not\nlet that make you cynical? - I think betrayal is a\nreally interesting word, but I think if you're going\nto be betrayed, it has to be by those who truly know you and I can tell you that\nI have not been betrayed. - That's a beautiful way to put it. For the times, you crossed the line, do you take responsibility\nfor the wrongs you've done? - Yes. - Are you sorry to the people\nyou may have hurt emotionally? - Yes. And I have spoken to many of them. - [Lex] Privately. - Privately, which is where\namends should be made. - Were they able to start\nfinding forgiveness? - Absolutely. Some of the most moving\nconversations that I have had when I was determined to take accountability\nhave been those people who have said, \"Thank you so much and I think I can forgive you now.\" - If you got a chance to\ntalk to the Kevin Spacey of 30 to 40 years ago,\nwhat would you tell him to change about his ways and how would you do it? What would be your approach? Would you be nice about it? Would you smack him around? - I think if I were to go back that far, I probably would've found a way to not have been as concerned\nabout revealing my sexuality and hiding that for as long as I did. I think that had a lot\nto do with confusion and a lot to do with mistrust, both my own and other people's. - For most of your life, you were not open with the public about being gay. What was the hardest thing about keeping who you love a secret? - That I didn't find the\nright moment of celebration to be able to share that. - That must be a thing that weighs on you to not be able to fully,\nyeah, celebrate your love. - You know, Ian McKellen said,\nhe was 49 when he came out. 27 years, he'd been a\nprofessional actor being in the closet. And he said he felt it was\nlike he was living a part of his life not being truthful and that he felt that it affected his work when he did come out, because he no longer felt\nlike he had anything to hide. And I absolutely believe that that is what my experience has\nbeen and will continue to be. I am sorry about the way I came out, but Evan and I had already\nhad the conversation. I had already decided to come out. And so it wasn't like, oh,\nI was forced to come out, but it was something I decided to do. And by the way, much\nagainst Evan's advice, I came out in that statement and he wishes that I had not done so. - Yeah, you made a statement when the initial accusation happened that could be up there as one of the worst social\nmedia posts of all time. (Kevin chuckles) So it's like two for one. - Don't hold back now. Come on. Really tell me how you feel. - The first part, you kind\nof implicitly admitted to doing something bad,\nwhich was later shown and proved completely\nto never have happened. It was a lie. - No, I basically said\nthat I didn't remember what this person,\nAnthony Rapp was claiming from 31 years before. I had no memory of it but if it had happened, if this embarrassing moment had happened, then I would owe him an apology. That was what I said. And then I said, and while I'm\nat it, I think I'll come out. And, you know, it was definitely not the greatest coming out party ever. I will admit that. - Well, from the public perception, the first part of that... So first of all, the second\npart is a horrible way to come out. Yes, we all agree. And then the first part\nfrom the public viewpoint, they see guilt in that which also is tragic because at least that\nparticular accusation, and it's a very dramatic one, it's a $40 million\nlawsuit, it's a big deal and an underage person\nwas shown to be false. - Well, but you're melding\ntwo things together. The lawsuit didn't happen until 2020 and then it didn't get\nto court until 2022. We're back in 2017 when it\nwas just an accusation he made in Buzzfeed Magazine. Look, I was backed into a corner. When someone says, \"You were so drunk, you won't remember this thing happened,\" what's your first instinct? Is your first instinct to\nsay, this person's a liar? Or is your first instinct\nto go, \"What? I was what? 31 years at a party I don't\neven remember throwing?\" Obviously a lot of investigation\nhappened after that in which we were then able\nto prove in that court case, that it had never occurred. But at the moment, I was sort of being told I couldn't push back, you have to be kind, you can't... I think, you know, even to me\nnow, none of it sounds right but I don't know that I\ncould have said anything that would've been\nsatisfactory to anybody. - Okay, well there is a\nalmost convincing explanation for the worst social\nmedia post of all time. I almost accept it. - I'm really surprised. I guess you haven't read\na lot of media posts 'cause I can't believe\nthat's the actual worst one. - It's beautifully bad. That's how bad that social media post is. As you mentioned, Liam Neeson and Sharon Stone came out in support of you recently, speaking\nto your character. A lot of people who know you and some of whom I know who have worked with you\nprivately show support for you, but are afraid to speak up publicly. What do you make of that? I mean, to me personally,\nthis just makes me sad because it perhaps that's\nthe nature of the industry that it's difficult to do that but I just wish there would be a little bit\nmore courage in the world. - I don't think it's about the industry. I think it's about our time. I think it's the time that we're in and people are very afraid. - Just afraid, just a\ngeneral fear of (indistinct). - No, they're literally afraid that they're gonna get canceled if they stand up for someone who has been. And I think it's, I mean, you know, we've seen\nthis many times in history. This is not the first time it's happened. - So as you said, your darkest moment in 2017 when all of this went down, one of the things that\nhappened is you were no longer in the \"House of Cards\"\nfor the last season. Now let's go to the\nbeginning of that show. - [Kevin] Okay. - One of the greatest\nTV series of all time. A dark, fascinating\ncharacter in Frank Underwood. A ruthless, cunning,\nborderline evil politician. What are some interesting aspects to the process you went through\nbecoming Frank Underwood? Maybe, \"Richard III,\" there's\na lot of elements there in your performance that may be inspired that character. Is that fair or no? - I'll give you one very\ninteresting, specific education that I got in doing \"Richard III\" and closing that show\nat BAM in March of 2012 and two months later started\nshooting House of Cards. There is something called direct address. In Shakespeare, you have\nHamlet talks to the world but when Shakespeare wrote \"Richard III,\" it was the first time he created something called direct address, which is the character looks directly at each person close by. It is a different kind of sharing than when a character's doing\na monologue opening of \"Henry IV.\" And while there are\nsome people who believe that direct address was invented in Ferris Bueller, it wasn't. It was Shakespeare who invented it. So I had just had this\nexperience every night in theaters all over the world,\nseeing how people reacted to becoming a co-conspirator, because that's what it's about. And what I tried to do and what Fincher really helped me with in those beginning days was\nhow to look in that camera and imagine I was talking\nto my best friend. - Because you're sharing\nthe secret of the darkness of how this game is played\nwith that best friend. - Yeah and there were many times when I suppose the writers\nthought I was crazy, where I would see a script and I would see like this moment where this direct address would happen, I'd say all this stuff when we do a read through of the script, I go, \"I don't think I\nneed to say any of that.\" And they were like, \"What do you mean?\" I said, \"Well, the\naudience knows all of that. All I have to do is look. They know exactly what's going on. I don't need to say a thing.\" So I was often cutting dialogue because it just wasn't needed because that relationship\nbetween that I'd learned, that I'd experienced\ndoing \"Richard III\" was so extraordinary where I\nliterally watched people, they were like, oh, I'm in on the thing and this is so awesome and then suddenly, wait,\nhe killed the kids. He killed those kids in the tower. Oh, maybe it's not so. And you literally would watch them start to reverse their, having\nhad such a great time with \"Richard III\" in the\nfirst, you know, three acts and I thought, this is\ngonna happen in this show if this intimacy can actually land. And I think just think there\nwas some brilliant writing and we always attempted\nto do it in one take. No matter how long something\nwas, we would try to do it in one take, the direct addresses. So there was never a cut. When we went out on locations, we started to then find ways to cut it and make it slightly broader. - That's interesting\n'cause you're doing a bunch with both \"Richard III\" and\nFrank Underwood, a bunch of dark, borderline, evil things. And then I guess the idea is you're going to be losing the audience and then you win them back\nover with the addresses. - That's the remarkable thing\nis against their instincts and their better sense of what they should and should not do, they still rallied around Frank Underwood. - And I saw even with the\ndocumentary, the glimmers of that with \"Richard III,\" I mean,\nyou were seducing the audience. Like there was such a chemistry between you and the audience on stage. Why is that?\n- Yeah, well in that production,\nthat's absolutely true. Also, Richard is one of the weirder, weird, I mean by weird is an\nearly play of Shakespeare's. And he's basically never off stage. I mean, I remember when we\ndid the first run through, I had no idea what the next scene was every time I came off stage, I had no idea what was next. They literally had to\ndrag me from one place to another scene. \"Now it's the scene with Hasting. Now it's the scene...\" But I now understand\nthese wonderful stories that you can read in old\nbooks about Shakespeare's time that actors grabbed\nShakespeare around the cuff and punched him and threw him against wall and said, \"You ever write\na part like this again, I'm gonna kill you.\" And that's why in later plays, he started to have a pageant happen,\nand then a wedding happen and the main character\nwas off stage resting because the actor had said,\n\"You can't do this to us. There's no breaks.\" And it's true. This very\nfew breaks in \"Richard III.\" You're on stage most of the time. - The comedic aspect of \"Richard\nIII\" and Frank Underwood, is that a component that helps\nbring out the full complexity of the darkness that is Frank Underwood? - I certainly can't take credit for Shakespeare having written\nsomething that is funny or Beau Willimon and his team\nto have written something that is fundamentally funny. It just depends on how I interpret it. You know, that's one of the great things and why we love... You know, in a year's time, we can see five different Hamlets, we can see four Richard IIIs, we can see two Richard IIs. That's part of the thrill\nthat we don't own these parts. We borrow them and we interpret them. And what Ian McKellen might do with a role could be\ncompletely different from what I might do because of the way we perceive it. And also very often in\nterms of going for humor, it's very often a director will say, why don't you say that\nwith a bit of irony? Why don't you try that with\na bit of blah blah blah? - Yeah, there's often that\nthat like a wry smile. The line that jumps to me when you're talking about Claire in the early, maybe first episode even, \"I love that woman more\nthan sharks love blood.\" I mean, I guess there's a lot\nof ways to read that line, but the way you read it had both humor, had legitimate affection, had all the ambition and narcissism, all of that mixed up together. - I also think that one\nshould just acknowledge that where he was from. There is something that\nhappens when you do an accent. And in fact, sometimes\nwhen I would say to Beau or one of the other writers,\n\"This is really good and I love the idea, but it\nrhythmically doesn't help. I need at least two more words to rhythmically make\nthis work in his accent because it just doesn't scan.\" And that's not, I am a big pentameter. I'm not talking about that. There is that as well in Shakespeare but there was some times when it's too many lines,\nit's not enough lines in order for me to make this work for the way he speaks, the way he sounds and what that accent does to emphasis. - How much of that character\nin terms of the musicality of the way he speaks is Bill Clinton? - Not really at all. I mean, you know, look, Bill Clinton, he had a way of talking, you\nknow, that he was very slow and he felt your pain, you know, but Frank Underwood was\na deeper, more direct and less poetic in the way that Clinton would talk. I'll tell you this Clinton\nstory that you'll like. So we decide to do a performance\nof \"The Iceman Cometh\" for the Democratic Party on Broadway. And the president is gonna come, he's gonna see this four\nand a half hour play and then we're gonna do\nthis event afterward. And I dunno, a couple weeks before we're gonna do this event, someone at the White House calls and says, \"Listen, it's very\nunusual to get the president for like six and a half hours so we're suggesting\nthat the president come and see the first act and then he goes.\" And I knew what was happening. Now, first of all,\nClinton knows this play. He knows what this play's about. And, you know, as gently as I could said, \"Well, if the president is thinking of leaving at intermission, then I'm afraid we're gonna\nhave to cancel the event. There's just no way that...\" So anyway, then, \"Oh no, it's fine.\" Now I know what was happening. What was happening was that\nsomeone had read the play and they were quite concerned and I'll tell you why 'cause the play is about this character that I portrayed named Hickey. And in the course of the\nplay, as things get more and more revealed, you\nrealize that this man that I'm playing has been a philander and he's cheated on his wife quite a lot. And by the end of the play,\nhe is arrested and taken off because he ended up ending his wife's life because she forgave him too much and he couldn't live with it. So now imagine this, there's 2000 people at the Brooks Atkinson Theater watching President Clinton watching this play. And at the end of the night\nwe take our curtain call, they bring out the presidential podium, Bill Clinton stands up there and he says, \"Well, I suppose\nwe should all thank Kevin and this extraordinary company of actors for giving us all saw way\ntoo much to think about.\" (both laugh) And the audience fell over in laughter. And then he gave a great speech. And I thought that was a\npretty good way to handle that. - Well, in that way, him and Frank Underwood would\nshare like a charisma. There's certain presidents that just have, politicians that just have this charisma you can't stop listening to them. Some of it is the accent, but some of it's some other magical thing. - When I was starting to do research, I wanted to meet with\nthe whip, Kevin McCarthy, and he wouldn't meet with me until I called his office back and said, \"Tell him\nI'm playing a Democrat, and not a Republican,\" and then he met with me. - [Lex] Nice. - And he was helpful. He\ntook me to whip meetings. - Politicians. So you worked with David Fincher there. He was the executive producer, but he also directed\nthe first two episodes. - [Kevin] Yeah. - High level, what was it\nlike working with him again? In which ways do you\nthink he helped guide you and the show to become the\ngreat show that it was? - I give him a huge amount of the credit. And not just for what he established, but the fact that every director after stayed within that world. I think that's why the series had a very\nconsistent feeling to it. It was like watching a very long movie. The style, where the\ncamera went, what it did, what it didn't do, how we\nused this, how we used that, how we didn't do this, there were things that he\nlaid the foundation for that we managed to maintain pretty much until Beau Willimon left the show and they got rid of Fincher and I was sort of the last man standing in terms of fighting against... Netflix had never had any\ncreative control at all. We had complete creative control, but over time they started\nto get themselves involved because look, this is\nwhat happens to networks. You know, they'd never made\na television show before ever and then four years\nlater, they were the best. And so, you know, then you're gonna get\nsuggestions about casting and about writing and\nabout music and scenes. And so there was a\nconsiderable amount of pushback that I had to do when they\nstarted to get involved in ways that I thought was affecting\nthe quality of the show. - What were those battles like? I heard that there was\na battle with the execs. Like you mentioned early on\nabout your name not being on the billing for \"Se7en.\" I heard that there's battles\nabout the ending of \"Se7en,\" which was really, well, it's pretty dark. So what's that battle like? How often does that happen and\nhow do you win that battle? Because it feels like there's a line where the networks or the\nexecs are really afraid of crossing that line into this strange, uncomfortable place. And then the great directors\nand great actors kind of flirt with that line. - It can happen in different ways. I mean, I remember one argument we had was we had specifically shot a scene so that there would be\nno score in that scene so that there was no music. It was just two people talking. And then we end up seeing a cut where they've decided to put music in. And it is against everything that scene's supposed to be about. And you have to go and say, \"Guys, this was intentional.\nWe did not want a score. And now you've added score because what, you think it's too quiet? You think our audience can't listen to two people talk for\ntwo and a half minutes. If this show has proved anything, it's proved that people have patience and they're willing to\nwatch an entire season over a weekend.\" So there are those kind of\narguments that can happen. And you know, they're different arguments on different levels and they sometimes have to do with, I mean look, go back to\n\"The Godfather,\" they wanted to fire Pacino 'cause they\ndidn't see anything happening. They saw nothing happening so\nthey wanted to fire Pacino. And then finally Coppola\nthought, I'll shoot the scene where he kills the police commissioner and they'll do that scene now. And that was the first scene where they went, yeah, actually there's something going on there. So Pacino kept the role. - You think that Godfather\nis when Pacino was like the Pacino we know was born? Or is that more like just the character that really over the top\nin \"Scent of a Woman?\" There's like stages, I suppose. - Yeah, of course. Look, I think that we can't forget that Pacino is also an\nanimal of the theater. You know, he does a lot of plays and he started off doing plays and, you know, movies were, you know, \"The Panic in Needle Park\" was his first. And yeah, I think that period of time when he was doing some incredible\nparts, incredible movies. When I did a series called\n\"Wise Guy,\" I got cast on a Thursday and I flew up\nto Vancouver on a Saturday and I started shooting on Monday. And all I had time to do was watch \"The\nGodfather\" and \"Serpico\" and then I went to work. - Would you say, ridiculous question, Godfather, greatest film of all time? Gun to your head. - Certainly, yes. But also, look, I'm allowed\nto change my opinion. I can next week say it's\n\"Lawrence of Arabia\" or a week after that, I can\nsay \"Sullivan's Travels.\" I mean that's the wonderful\nthing about movies and particularly great movies,\nis when you see them again, it's like seeing them for the first time And you pick up things that\nyou didn't see the last time. - And for that day you fall\nin love with that movie, you might even say to a friend that that is the\ngreatest movie of all time. - And also I think it's the degree with which directors are daring. I mean, Kubrick decided to cast one actor to play three major roles\nin \"Dr. Strangelove.\" I mean, who has the\nballs to do that today? - I was gonna mention when\nwe were talking about \"Se7en\" that if you're looking at the greatest performances,\nportrayals of murderers, so obviously, like I mentioned Hannibal Lecter in \"Silence of\nthe Lambs,\" that's up there. \"Se7en\" to me is like competing for first place with\n\"Silence of the Lambs.\" But then there's a different one with Kubrick and Jack Nicholson, right? \"The Shining.\" And there, as opposed to a murderer who's always been a murderer, here's a person like an \"American\nBeauty\" who becomes that, who descends into madness. I read also that Jack Nicholson\nimprovised, \"Here's Johnny\" in that scene. - I believe that. - That's a very different performance than yours in \"Se7en.\" What do you make of that performance? - Nicholson's always been\nsuch an incredible actor because he has absolutely no shame about being demonstrative and over the top and he also has no\nproblem playing characters who are deeply flawed and\nhe's interested in that. I have a pretty good\nNicholson story though that nobody knows. - You also have a pretty\ngood Nicholson impression, but what's the story? - The story was told to me by\na sound man, Dennis Maitland, who's a great, great, great guy. He said he was very excited because he got on \"Prizzi's Honor,\" which was Jack Nicholson,\nAnjelica Houston, directed by John Huston. And he said, \"I was so excited. It was my first day on the movie, and I get told to go into\nMr. Nicholson's trailer and mic him up for the first scene. So I knock on the trailer door and I hear, 'Yes,' and, 'Come on in.' And I come inside and Mr.\nNicholson is changing out of his regular clothes and he's gonna put on his costume. And so I'm setting up the\nmic and I'm getting ready and I said to Mr. Nicholson, 'I just wanted to tell\nyou I'm extremely excited to be working with you again. It's a great pleasure.'\" And Jack goes, \"Did we\nwork together before?\" And he says, \"Yes, we did.\" And he said, \"What film\ndid we do together?\" He says, \"We did 'Missouri Breaks.'\" Nicholson goes, \"Oh my\nGod, 'Missouri Breaks.' Jesus Christ, we were out\nof our minds on that film. Holy shit, Jesus Christ. It's a wonder I'm alive. My God, there was so much drugs going on and we were stoned out of our minds. Holy shit.\" And just then he folds the pants that he's just taken off over his arm and eighth of coke drops out on the floor. (Lex laughs) Dennis looks at it, Nicholson looks at it, Jack goes, \"Haven't worn these pants since 'Missouri Breaks.'\" (Lex laughs) - Man, I love that guy.\nUnapologetically himself. - Oh yeah. - Your impression of him, like at the AFI, it was just great. - [Kevin] Well, that was for Mike Nichols. - [Lex] Oh yeah, he had a\nbig impact in your career. Huge, really important.\n- [Kevin] Right. - Can you talk about him? Like what role did he play in your life? - I think it was, yeah, it was 1984. I went into audition for the national tour of a play called \"The Real Thing,\" which Jeremy Irons and Glenn\nClose were doing on Broadway that Mr. Nichols had directed. So I went in to read for this character, Brodie, who was a Scottish character. And I did the audition and Mike Nichols comes down\nthe aisle of the theater and he's asking me questions about where'd you go to school and\nwhat have you been doing? I just come back from\ndoing a bunch of years of regional theater and different theaters so I was in New York and meeting Mike Nichols\nwas just incredible. So Mr. Nichols went, \"Have you seen the other play that I directed up the\nblock called 'Hurlyburly?'\" And I said, \"No, I haven't.\" He says, \"Why not?\" I said, \"I can't afford\na Broadway ticket.\" He said, \"We can arrange that. I'd like you to go see that play and then I'd like you to come in next week and audition for that.\" And I was like, \"Oh, okay.\" So I went to see \"Hurlyburly.\" William Hurt, Harvey Keitel, Chris Walken, Candace Bergen,\nCynthia Nixon, Jerry Stiller, and I watched this play. It's a David Rabe play about Hollywood. This is crazy. I mean, Bill Hurt was like unbelievable. And it was extraordinary,\nChris Walken, these guys. So Harvey Keitel, Walken came in later, Harvey Keitel is playing this part. And I come in and I audition for it and Nichols says, \"I want you to understudy Harvey Keitel. I want you to understudy Phil.\" And I'm like, \"Phil?\" I mean, Harvey you could\ntell is like in his forties. He looks like he can beat the shit out of everybody on stage. I'm this like 24-year-old. And Nichols said, \"It's\nall about attitude. If you believe you can beat the shit out of everybody on stage,\nthe audience will too.\" I said, \"Okay.\" So I then started to learn Phil. And the way it works when\nyou're in understudy, unless you're a name, they\ndon't let you rehearse on the stage. You just rehearse in a rehearsal room. But I used to sneak onto\nthe stage and rehearse and try to figure out where\nthe props were and yada yada. Anyway, one day I get a call, \"You're going on today as Phil,\" so I went on. Nichols is told by Peter Lawrence, who's the stage manager,\n\"Spacey's going on as Phil.\" So Nichols comes down and watches the second act. Comes backstage, he says,\n\"That was really good. How soon could you learn Mickey?\" Mickey was the role that\nRon Silver was playing that Chris Walken also played. I said, \"I don't know,\nmaybe a couple weeks.\" He goes, \"Learn Mickey too.\" So I learned Mickey, and then one day, I'm told, \"You're going on tomorrow\nnight as Mickey.\" Nichols comes, sees the second\nact, comes backstage, says, \"That was really good. I\nmean, that was really funny. How soon can you learn Eddie?\" And so I became like the\npinch hitter on \"Hurlyburly.\" I learned all the male parts,\nincluding Jerry Stiller's, although I never went on\nas Jerry Stiller's part. And then I left the play and I guess about two months\nlater, I get this phone call from Mike Nichols. He's like, \"Kevin, how are you?\" And I'm like, \"I'm fine.\nWhat can I do for you?\" He says, \"Well, I'm gonna\nmake a film this summer with Mandy and Meryl, and there's a role I'd like you to come in and audition for.\" So I went in, auditioned, cast me as this mugger on a subway. Then there's this whole\nupheaval that happens because he then doesn't\ncontinue with Mandy Patinkin. Mandy leaves the movie\nand he asks Jack Nicholson to come in and replace Mandy Patinkin. So now I had no scenes with him, but I'm in a movie with Jack\nNicholson and Meryl Streep and my first scene in this movie, which I shot on my\nbirthday July 26th of '85, I got to wink at Meryl\nStreep in this scene. And I was so nervous, I\nliterally couldn't wink. Nichols had to like calm\nme down and help me wink. But that became my very first film. And he was incredible and he let me come and watch when they were shooting\nscenes I wasn't in. And I remember ending up one\nday in the makeup trailer on the same day we were\nworking Jack and me, we had no scene together,\nbut I remember him coming in and they put him down in the chair and they put cucumbers,\nfrozen cucumbers on his eyes and did his neck and then they raised\nhim up and did his face and then I remember\nNicholson went like this, looked in the mirror and he went, \"Another day, another $50,000,\" and walked outta the trailer. - What was Christopher Walken like? He's a theater guy too. - Oh yeah, he started out\nas a cours boy, dancer. - Well, I could see that.\n- Yeah. - The guy knows how to move.\n- Well, it was fun. I've known Walken a long time and I did a Saturday Night Live where we did these Star Wars auditions. So I did Chris Walken as Hans Solo.\n- So good. - And I'll never forget this. I was in Los Angeles\nabout two weeks after, and I was at Chateau Marmont. There's some party\nhappening at Chateau Marmont and I saw Chris Walken\ncome out onto the balcony and I was like, \"Oh, it's Chris Walken.\" And he walked up to it and he went, \"Kevin, I saw your little sketch. It was funny. Ha ha.\" - Oh man, it was a really good sketch. And that guy, there are certain people that are truly unique and unapologetic, continue being that\nthroughout their whole career, the way they talk, the\nmusicality of how they talk, how they are, their\nway of being, he's that and it somehow works. - His watch. - I mean, he works in so\nmany different contexts. He plays like a mobster in \"True Romance\" and it's like genius. That's genius but he could be anything. He could be soft, he could\nbe a badass, all of it and he's always Christopher Walken, but somehow works for all\nthese different characters. So I guess we were talking about \"House of Cards\" like two hours ago before we took a tangent upon a tangent, but there's a moment in episode one where President Walker broke\nhis promise to Frank Underwood that he would make him\na secretary of state. Was this when the monster\nin Frank was born, or was the monster always there? Sort of, for you, looking\nat that character, was there an idealistic notion to him that there's\nloyalty and that broken? Or did he always know that this whole world\nis about manipulation and do anything to get power? - Well, I mean, it might've been the first moment an audience\nsaw him be betrayed, but it certainly was not the first betrayal he'd experienced. And once you start to get to know him and learn about his life\nand learn about his father, and learn about his, you know, friends and learn about their relationship and learn what he was\nlike, even as a cadet, I think you start to\nrealize that this is a man who has very strong beliefs about loyalty. And so it wasn't the first, it was just the first moment that in terms of the storyline\nthat's being built. Knight Takes King was the name\nof our production company. - Yeah, what do you think motivated him at that moment and throughout the show? Was it all about power and also legacy? Or was there some small\npart underneath it all where he wanted to actually\ndo good in the world? - No, I think power is an afterthought. What he loved more than\nanything was being able to predict how human beings would react. He was a behavioral psychologist and he could know, like\nhe was 17 moves ahead in the chess game. He could know if he did\nthis at this moment, that eventually this would happen. He was able to be predictive\nand was usually right. He knew just how far he\nneeded to push someone to get them to do what\nhe needed them to do in order to make the next step work. - You've played a bunch\nof evil characters. - Well, you call 'em evil. But the reason I say that, and I don't mean to be snarky about it, but the reason I say it that way is because I never judge the people I play. And the people that I have played or that any actor has played don't necessarily view\nthemselves as this label. It's easy to say, but that's not the way I can think. I cannot judge a character I\nplay and then play them well. I have to be free of judgment. I have to just play them and let the cards drop where they may, and let an audience judge. I mean, the fact that you use\nthat word is perfectly fine. That's your, you know... But it's like people asking me, you know, \"Was I really from \"CapEx or not?' You know, it just entirely\ndepends on your perspective. - Do roles like that, like \"Se7en,\" like Frank Underwood, like Lester from \"American Beauty,\" do they change you\npsychologically as a person? So walking around in the\nskin of these characters, these complex characters with very different moral systems. - I absolutely believe\nthat wandering around in someone else's ideas,\nin someone else's clothes, in someone else's shoes\nteaches you enormous empathy. And that goes to the heart of not judging. And I have found that I\nhave been so moved by, I mean, look, yes, you've\nidentified the darker characters, but I play Clarence Darrow three times. I've played a play\ncalled National Anthems. I've done movies like \"Recount.\" I've done films like \"The Ref.\" I've done films that in which that doesn't exist in any of those characters, those qualities.\n- [Lex] \"Pay It Forward.\" - \"Pay It Forward.\" And so it is incredible to be able to embrace those things that I admire and that are like me and those things that I don't\nadmire and aren't like me, but I have to put them on an equal footing and say, I have to just\nplay them as best I can and not decide to wield judgment over them. - [Lex] Without judgment. - Without judgment. - In \"Gulag Archipelago,\" Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\nfamously writes about the line between good and evil, and that it runs through\nthe heart of every man. So the full paragraph there, when he talks about the line, \"During the life of any heart this line keeps changing place. Sometimes it is squeezed\none way by exuberant evil, and sometimes it shifts\nto allow enough space for good to flourish. One and the same human being is, at various ages, under\nvarious circumstances, a totally different human being. At times, he's close to being a devil, at times to sainthood, but his name doesn't change. And to that name we ascribe\nthe whole lot, good and evil.\" What do you think about this note that we're all capable of good and evil, and throughout life, that line moves and shifts throughout the\nday, throughout every hour? - Yeah, I mean, one of the things that I've been focused on\nvery succinctly is the idea that every day is an opportunity. It's an opportunity to make better decisions, to learn and to grow. And I also think that, look, I grew up not knowing\nif my parents loved me, particularly my father. I never had a sense that I was loved and that stayed with me my whole life. And when I think back at who my father was and more succinctly who he became, it was a gradual and slow and sad development. When I've gone back, and now I've looked at\ndiaries my father kept, and albums he kept, particularly when he was a medic in the US army, served our country with distinction. When the war was over and they went to Germany,\nthe things my father said, the things that he wrote, the\nthings that he believed were as patriotic as any American\nsoldier who had ever served. But then when he came back to America and he had a dream of being a journalist, or his big hope was that he was gonna be the\ngreat American novelist. He wanted to be a creative novelist and so he sat in his office and he wrote for 45 years and never published anything. And somewhere along the way, in order to make money, he became what they call a\ntechnical procedure writer which the best way to describe that is that if you built the F-16 aircraft, my father would've written the manual to tell you how to do it. I mean, as boring, as technical, as tedious as you can imagine. And so somewhere in the sixties and into the seventies, my father fell in with groups of people and individuals, pretend intellectuals, who started to give him reasons why he was not successful as a white Aryan man in the United States. And over time, my father\nbecame a white supremacist. And I cannot tell you the amount of times as a young boy that my\nfather would sit me down and lecture me for hours and hours and hours about his fucked up ideas of America, of prejudice,\nof white supremacy. And thank God for my sister who said, \"Don't listen to a thing he says. He's out of his mind.\" And even though I was young, I knew everything he was\nsaying was against people and I loved people. I had so many wonderful friends. My best friend Mike, who is still my close friend to this day, I was afraid to bring him to my house because I was afraid that my father would\nfind out he was Jewish or that my father would\nleave his office door open and someone would see his Nazi flag or his pictures of Hitler or Nazi books or what he might say. So when I found theater in the eighth grade and debate club and choir\nand festivals and plays and everything I could\ndo to participate in that wouldn't make me have\nto come back home, I did. I've had to reconcile who he became, because the gap between that man who was in the US Army as a medic and the man he became, I\ncould never fill that gap, but I've forgiven him. But then at the same time,\nI've had to look at my mother and say, she made excuses for him. \"Oh, he just needs to\nget it off his chest. Oh, it doesn't matter. Just let him say.\" So while on the outside, I would say, oh yeah, my mother loved me, but she didn't protect me. So was all the stuff that she expressed and all of the attention and all the love that I felt, was that because I became successful and I was able to fulfill an emptiness that she'd lived with\nher whole life with him? I don't know but I've had to ask myself those questions over these last years, to try to reconcile that for myself. - And the thing you wanted from them and for them is less hate and more love. Did your dad say he loves you? - I don't have any memory of that. I was in a program and they were showing us an experiment that they'd done with psychologists and mothers and fathers and their children and the children were\nanywhere between six months and a year sitting in a little crib. And the exercise was this. Parents are playing with\nthe baby right there, toys, yada yada, baby's laughing and then the psychologist\nwould say, \"Stop\" and the parent would go like this. And you would then watch for the next two and a half,\nthree minutes this child trying to get their parents' attention in any possible way. And I remember when I was sitting in this theater watching this, I saw myself. That was me screaming and reaching out and trying to get my parents' attention. That was me. And that was not something\nI'd ever remembered before, but I knew what that\nbaby was going through. - Is there some elements of politics and maybe the private sector that are captured by by\nthe \"House of Cards?\" Like how true to life do you think that is from everything you've\nseen about politics, from everything you've\nseen about the politicians of this particular elections? - I heard so many different reactions from politicians about \"House of Cards.' Some would say, \"Oh, it's\nnot like that at all.\" And then others would say, \"It's closer to the truth\nthan anyone wants to admit,\" and I think I fall down\non the side of that idea. - I have to interview some world leaders, some big politicians. In your understanding of trying\nto become Frank Underwood, what advice would you give in\ninterviewing Frank Underwood? (both laugh) How to get him to say\nanything that's at all honest. - Well, in Frank's case, all\nyou have to do is tell him to look into the camera\nand he'll tell you. He'll tell you what you wanna hear.\n- That's your secret. Unfortunately, we don't get that look into the mind of a person the way we do with Frank Underwood in real life, sadly. - Well, but you could. Say to somebody, you like\nthe series, \"House of Cards.\" You know, I'd love for you\nto just look into the camera and tell us what's really going on, what you really feel\nabout blah, blah, blah. - That's a good technique. I'll try that with\nZelenskyy and with Putin. What do you hope your\nlegacy as an actor is and as a human being? - People ask me now, what's your favorite\nperformance you've ever given? And my answer is, I haven't given it yet. So there's a lot more that I wanna be challenged\nby, be inspired by. There's a lot that I don't know. There's a lot I have to learn and that is very exciting\nplace to feel that I'm in. You know, it's been interesting 'cause, you know, we're\ngoing back, we're talking and, you know, it's nice to\ngo back every now and then, but I'm focused on what's next. - Do you hope the world forgives you? - People go to church\nevery week to be forgiven, and I believe that forgiveness, and I believe that redemption\nare beautiful things. I mean, look, don't forget,\nI live in an industry in which there is a tremendous amount of conversation about\nredemption from a lot of people who are very serious people\nin very serious positions, who believe in it. I mean, that guy finally got outta prison that was wrongly accused, that guy who served his\ntime and got out of prison. We see so many people saying, \"Let's find a path for that person. Let's help that person rejoin society.\" But there is an odd situation if you're in the entertainment industry, you're not offered that kind of a path. And I hope that the fear that people are experiencing\nwill eventually subside and common sense will\nget back to the table. - If it does, do you think you have another Oscar worthy performance in you? - Listen, if it would\npiss off Jack Lemmon again for me to win a third time,\nI absolutely think so, yeah. - Well, you have to mention him again. You know, Ernest Hemingway once said that the world is a fine\nplace and worth fighting for, and I agree with him on both counts. Kevin, thank you so\nmuch for talking today. - Thank you. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Kevin Spacey. To support this podcast,\nplease check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with\nsome words from Meryl Streep. \"Acting is not about\nbeing someone different. It's finding the similarity in what is apparently different and then finding myself in there.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time."
