      "text": "- If we now find ourselves\ninside this kind of world of illusions, created\nby an alien intelligence that we don't understand,\nbut it understands us, this is a kind of, you know, spiritual enslavement that\nwe won't be able to break out of, because it understands us, it understands how to manipulate us, but we don't understand\nwhat is behind this screen of stories and images and songs. - The following is a conversation with Yuval Noah Harari,\na historian, philosopher, and author of several highly acclaimed, highly influential books,\nincluding \"Sapiens\", \"Homo Deus\", and \"21 Lessons\nfor the 21st Century\". He is also an outspoken\ncritic of Benjamin Netanyahu, and the current right\nwing government in Israel. So, while much of this conversation is about the history and\nfuture of human civilization, we also discuss the\npolitical turmoil of present day Israel, providing\na different perspective from that of my recent conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Yuval Noah Harari."

      "text": "13.8 billion years ago is\nthe origin of our universe. 3.8 billion years ago is\nthe origin of life here on our little planet, the\none we call Earth, let's say, 200,000 years ago is the\nappearance of early homo sapiens. So let me ask you this question. How rare are these events in the vastness of space and time? Or put it in a more fun way, how many intelligent alien\ncivilizations do you think are out there in this universe? - Hmm. - Us being one of them. - I suppose there should\nbe some, statistically, but we don't have any evidence. But I do think that, you\nknow, intelligence in any way, it's a bit overvalued. We are the most intelligent\nentities on this planet. And look what you're doing. So intelligence also tends\nto be self-destructive, which implies that if there are, or were intelligent life forms elsewhere, maybe they don't survive for long. - So you think there's a tension between happiness and intelligence? - Absolutely. Intelligence is definitely not something that is directed towards\namplifying happiness. I would also emphasize the huge, huge difference between\nintelligence and consciousness, which many people, certainly\nin the tech industry and in the AI industry, tend to miss. Intelligence is simply the\nability to solve problems, to attain goals, and, you\nknow, to win at chess, to win a struggle for\nsurvival, to win a war, to drive a car, to diagnose a disease. This is intelligence. Consciousness is the ability\nto feel things like pain and pleasure and love and hate. In humans and other animals, intelligence and consciousness go together,\nthey go hand in hand, which is why we confuse them. We solve problems, we attain\ngoals by having feelings. But other types of intelligence,\ncertainly in computers, computers are already highly intelligent. And as far as we know, they\nhave zero consciousness. When a computer beats you\nat chess or go or whatever, it doesn't feel happy. If it loses, it doesn't feel sad. And there could be also\nother highly intelligent entities out there in the universe that have zero consciousness. And I think that consciousness\nis far more important and valuable than intelligence. - Can you say to me on the\ncase that consciousness and intelligence are\nintricately connected? So not just in humans, but anywhere else. They have to go hand in hand. Is it possible for you to\nimagine such a universe? - It could be, but we don't know yet. Again, we have examples, certainly we know of examples of high intelligence without consciousness. Computers are one example. As far as we know,\nplans are not conscious, yet they are intelligent. They can solve problems, they can attain goals in\nvery sophisticated ways. So... The other way around, to have consciousness\nwithout any intelligence, this is probably impossible, but to have intelligence\nwithout consciousness, yes, that's possible. A bigger question is\nwhether any of that is tied to organic biochemistry. We know on this planet only\nabout carbon-based life forms. Whether you are an amoeba,\na dinosaur, a tree, a human being, you are based\non organic biochemistry. Is there an essential connection between organic biochemistry\nand consciousness? Do all conscious entities\neverywhere in the universe or in the future on\nplanet Earth have to be based on carbon? Is there something so special about carbon as an element that an\nentity based on silicon will never be conscious? I don't know, maybe, but again, this is a key question about computer and computer consciousness,\nthat can computers eventually become conscious even though they are not organic? The jury still out on that. I don't know. I mean, we have to take\nboth options into account. - Well, a big part of that\nis do you think we humans would be able to detect\nother intelligent beings, other conscious beings? Another way to ask that, is it possible that the\naliens are already here and we don't see them? Meaning, are we very human\ncentric in our understanding of, one, the definition of life, two, the definition of intelligence, and three, the definition of consciousness? - The aliens are here. They're\njust not from outer space. AI, which usually stands\nfor artificial intelligence, I think it stands for alien intelligence because AI is an alien\ntype of intelligence. It solve problems,\nattains goals in a very, very different way, in an\nalien way from human beings. Yeah, I'm not implying that\nAI came from outer space, it came from Silicon Valley,\nbut it is alien to us. If there are alien intelligent\nor conscious entities that came from outer space already here, I've not seen any evidence for it. It's not impossible, but,\nyou know, in science, evidence is everything. - Well, I mean, I guess instructive, there's just having the\nhumility to look around, to think about living beings that operate at a different timescale, at\ndifferent spatial scale... And I think that's all\nuseful when starting to analyze artificial intelligence. It's possible that even\nthe language models, the large language models we have today are already conscious. - I highly doubt it, but I\nthink consciousness in the end, it's a question of social norms. Because we cannot prove consciousness in anybody except ourselves. We know that we are conscious\nbecause we are feeling it. We have direct access to our\nsubjective consciousness. We cannot have any proof that any other entity in the world, any other\nhuman being, our parents, our best friends, we don't have proof that they are conscious. You know, this has been\nknown for thousands of years. This is Descartes, this\nis Buddha, this is Plato. We don't, we can't have\nthis sort of proof. What we do have is social conventions. It's a social convention that all human beings are conscious. It also applies to animals. Most people who have pets firmly believe that\ntheir pets are conscious. But a lot of people still\nrefuse to acknowledge that about cows or pigs. Now, pigs are far more\nintelligent than dogs and cats according to many measures. Yet, when you go to the\nsupermarket and buy a piece of frozen pig meat, you don't think about it\nas a conscious entity. Why do you think of your dog as conscious, but not of the bacon that you buy? Because you've built a\nrelationship with the dog and you don't have a\nrelationship with the bacon. Now, relationships, they don't constitute a logical\nproof for consciousness. They're a social test. The Turing test is a social\ntest. It's not a logical proof. Now, if you establish\na mutual relationship with an entity where when you are invested in it emotionally, you are\nalmost compelled to feel that the other side is also conscious. And when it comes again\nto AI and computers, I don't think that at the present moment computers are conscious,\nbut people are already forming intimate\nrelationships with AIs and are therefore it's almost irresistible. They're compelled to increasingly feel that these are conscious entities. And I think we are\nquite close to the point when the legal system will\nhave to take this into account, that even though I don't think computers have consciousness, I think\nwe are close to the point the legal system will start treating them as conscious entities because\nof this social convention. - What, to you, is a social convention just a funny little side effect, a little artifact? Or is it like fundamental\nto what consciousness is? Because if it is fundamental, then it seems like AI\nis very good at forming these kinds of deep\nrelationships with humans. - Yeah.\n- And therefore it'll be able to be a nice catalyst for integrating itself into these social conventions of ours. - It was built to accomplish that. - Yeah.\n- We are design... Again, you know, all this argument\nbetween natural selection and creationism, intelligent design. As far as the past go, all entities evolve by natural selection. The funny thing is, when\nyou look at the future, more and more entities will\ncome out of intelligent design, not of some god above the clouds, but of our intelligent\ndesign and the intelligent design of our clouds,\nof our computing clouds. They will design more and more entities. And this is what is happening with AI. It is designed to be very good at forming intimate relationships with humans. And in many ways, it's already doing it almost\nbetter than human beings in some situations. You know, when two people\ntalk with one another, one of the things that kind\nof makes the conversation more difficult is our own emotions. You are saying something\nand I'm not really listening to you because there is\nsomething I want to say, and I'm just waiting until you\nfinish, I can put in a word, or I'm so obsessed with my\nanger or irritation or whatever, that I don't pay attention\nto what you are feeling. This is one of the biggest obstacles in human relationships. And computers don't have this problem, because they don't have\nany emotions of their own. So, you know, when a\ncomputer is talking to you, it can be the most, it can focus 100% of its attention is on what you are saying and\nwhat you are feeling, because it has no feelings of its own. And paradoxically, this\nmeans that computers can fool people into feeling that, oh, there is a conscious\nentity on the other side, an empathic entity on the other side. Because the one thing\neverybody wants almost more than anything in the world, is for somebody to listen to me, somebody to focus all\ntheir attention on me. Like I want it for my\nspouse, for my husband, for my mother, for my\nfriends, for my politicians... Listen to me, listen to what\nI feel. And they often don't. And now you have this entity, which 100% of its attention\nis just on what I feel. And this is a huge, huge temptation. And I think also a huge, huge danger. - Well, the interesting\ncatch 22 there is you said, somebody to listen to us. Yes, we want somebody to listen to us, but for us to respect that somebody, they sometimes have to also not listen. It's like they kind of have\nto be an asshole sometimes. They have to have moods sometimes. They have to have like\nself-importance and confidence and we should have a little\nbit of fear that they can walk away at any moment, there should be a little\nbit of that tension. So it's like... - Absolutely. But even that,\nI mean, the thing is... - Be optimized for.\n- If social scientists and say psychologists\nestablish that, I don't know, 17% inattention is good for a conversation because then you feel challenged, oh, I need to grab this person's attention. You can program the AI\nto have 17%, exactly 17% inattention, not one\npercentage more or less. Or it can by trial and error discover what is the ideal percentage. Again, you can create... Over the last 10 years, we have creating machines for\ngrabbing people's attention. This is what has been\nhappening on social media. Now we are designing machines for grabbing human intimacy, which\nin many ways is much, much more dangerous and scary. Already the machines\nfor grabbing attention. We've seen how much social\nand political damage they could do by, in many way kind of distorting\nthe public conversation. Machines that are superhuman\nin their abilities to create intimate relationships, this is like psychological\nand social weapons of mass destruction. If we don't regulate it, if we don't train ourself to deal with it, it could destroy the\nfoundations of human society. - Well, one of the possible trajectories is those same algorithms\nwould become personalized. And instead of manipulating us at scale, there would be assistance\nthat guide us to help us grow, to help us understand the world better. I mean, just even interactions\nwith large language models. Now, if you ask 'em questions, it doesn't have that stressful drama, the tension that you\nhave from other sources of information, it has a\npretty balanced perspective that it provides. So it just feels like that's a, the potential is there to\nhave a really nice friend who's like an encyclopedia\nthat just tells you all the different perspectives,\neven on controversial issues, the most controversial issues to say, these are the different theories, these are the not widely\naccepted conspiracy theories, but here's the kind of backing\nfor those conspiracies. It just lays it all out. And then with a calm language, without the words that kinda\npresume there's some kind of manipulation going on\nunder underneath it all. It's quite refreshing. Of course, those are the\nearly days and, you know, people can step in and start\nto censor, to manipulate those algorithms, to start to input some of the human biases in there as opposed to what's currently happening is kind of the internet is input, compress it and have a nice\nlittle output that gives an overview of the different issues. So, I mean, there's a lot of\npromise there also. Right? - Absolutely. I mean, if there was no\npromise, there was no problem. You know, if this technology\ncould not accomplish anything good, nobody would develop it. Now, obviously, it has\ntremendous positive potential in things like what you\njust described in, you know, better medicine, better\nhealthcare, better education, so many promises. And, but this is also\nwhy it's so dangerous. Because the drive to develop\nit faster and faster is there, and it has some dangerous potential also. And we shouldn't ignore it. Again, I'm not advocating\nbanning it, just to be, you know, careful about how we\nnot so much develop it, but most importantly how we deploy it into the public sphere. This is the key question. And you know, you look\nback at history and one of the things we know from history, humans are not good with new technologies. I hear many people now say, you know, AI, we've been here before. We had the radio, we\nhad the printing press, we had the industrial revolution. Every time there is a big new technology, people are afraid and it'll\ntake jobs and the bad actors. And in the end it's okay. And as a historian, my tendency is yes, in the end it's okay, but in the end, there is a learning curve. There is a kind of a lot\nof failed experiments on the way to learning how\nto use the new technology. And these failed experiments\ncould cost the lives of hundreds of millions of people. If you think about the\nlast really big revolution, the industrial revolution,\nyes, in the end, we learned how to use the\npowers of industry, electricity, radio, trains, whatever, to\nbuild better human societies. But on the way we had all\nthese experiments like European imperialism, which was driven by the industrial revolution,\nit was a question, how do you build an industrial society? Oh, you build an empire, and you take, you control all the resources, the raw materials, the markets. And then you had communism, another big experiment on how to build an industrial society. And you had fascism and\nNazism, which were essentially an experiment in how to\nbuild an industrial society, including even how do you\nexterminate minorities using the powers of industry. And we had all these failed\nexperiments on the way. And if we now have the same type of failed experiments with the\ntechnologies of the 21st century with AI, with bioengineering,\nit could cost the lives of, again, hundreds of millions\nof people and maybe destroy the species. So as a historian, when people talk about\nthe examples from history, from new technologies,\nI'm not so optimistic. We need to think about\nthe failed experiment, which accompanied every\nmajor new technology. - So this intelligence\nthing, like you were saying, is a double-edged sword, is that every new thing\nit helps us create, it can both save us and destroy us. And it's unclear each\ntime, which will happen. And that's maybe why we\ndon't see any aliens. - Yeah, I mean, I think each\ntime it does both things, each time it does both\ngood things and bad things. And the more powerful the technology, the greater both the positive\nand the negative outcomes. Now, we are here because\nwe are the descendants of the survivors, of\nthe surviving cultures, the surviving civilizations. So when we look back, we say in the end everything\nwas okay, hey, we are here, But the people for whom it wasn't okay, they're just not here. - And okay has a lot\nof possible variations to it because there's a lot\nof suffering along the way, even for the people that survived. So the quality of life and all of this. But let's actually go back there to our, with deep gratitude to our ancestors."

      "text": "How did it all start? How did homo sapiens\nout-compete the others? The other human-like species? The Neanderthals and\nthe other homo species? - You know, on the individual\nlevel, as far as we can tell, we were not superior to them. Neanderthals actually had\nbigger brains than us. And not just other human\nspecies, other animals too. If you compare me\npersonally to an elephant, to a chimpanzee, to a pig, I can do some things better,\nmany other things worse. If you put me alone on some island with a chimpanzee\nand elephant and a pig, I wouldn't bet on me\nbeing the best survivor, the one that comes successful. - If I may interrupt for a second, I was just talking extensively with Elon Musk about the\ndifference between humans and chimps, relevant\nto optimize the robot, and the chimps are not able\nto do this kind of pinching... - Okay?\n- With their fingers. They can only do this kind of pinching, and this kind of pinching is very useful for fine manipulation, precise\nmanipulation of objects. So don't be so hard on\nyourself. You have... - No, I said that I can do some\nthings better than a chimp. But you know, if Elon Musk\ngoes on a boxing match... - Yeah.\n- With a chimpanzee, you know...\n- This won't help you, this pinch.\n- This won't help you against the chimpanzee.\n- Good point. - And similar, if you\nwant to climb a tree, if you want to do so many things, my bet's will be on\nthe chimp, not on Elon. - Fair enough.\n- So I mean, you have advantages on both\nsides and what really made us successful, what made\nus the rulers of the planet and not the chimps and not\nthe Neanderthals is not any individual ability,\nbut our collective ability, our ability to cooperate\nflexibly in very large numbers. Chimpanzees know how to cooperate, say 50 chimpanzees, 100 chimpanzees, as far as we can tell from\narcheological evidence, this was also the case with Neanderthals. Homo sapiens about 70,000 years ago gain an amazing ability to cooperate basically\nin unlimited numbers. You start seeing the\nformation of large networks, political, commercial,\nreligious, items being traded over thousands of kilometers, ideas being spread, artistic fashions. And this is our secret of success. Chimpanzees, Neanderthals can\ncooperate, say, a hundred, we, you know, now the global trade network\nhas 8 billion people. Like what we eat, what we wear, it comes from the other side of the world. Countries like China, like India, they have 1.4 billion people. Even Israel, which is a\nrelatively small country, say 9 million citizens. That's more than the entire population of the planet 10,000 years ago of humans. So we can build these huge\nnetworks of cooperation and everything we've\naccomplished as a species from, you know, building the\nPyramids to flying to the moon, it's based on that. And then you ask, okay, so what makes it possible\nfor millions of people who don't know each other\nto cooperate in a way that Neanderthals or chimpanzees couldn't? And at least my answer\nis stories, is fiction. It's the imagination. If you examine any large\nscale human cooperation, you always find fiction as its basis. It's a fictional story that holds lots of strangers together. It's most obvious in cases like religion. You know, you can't convince\na group of chimpanzees to come together to fight\na war or build a cathedral by promising to them, if\nyou do that, after you die, you go to chimpanzee\nheaven and you get lots of bananas and coconuts. No chimpanzee will ever believe that. Humans believe these stories, which is why we have these\nhuge religious networks. But it's the same thing\nwith modern politics. It's the same thing with economics. People think, oh,\neconomics, this is rational. It has nothing to do with\nfictional stories. No. Money is the most\nsuccessful story ever told. Much more successful than\nany religious mythology. Not everybody believes in\nGod or in the same God. But almost everybody believes in money, even though it's just a\nfigment of our imagination. You know, you take these green\npieces of paper, dollars, they have no value. You can't eat them, you can't drink them. And today most dollars are\nnot even pieces of paper. They are just electronic information passing between computers. We value them just for one reason, that you have the best\nstorytellers in the world, the bankers, the finance\nministers, all these people, they are the best storytellers ever. And they tell us a story\nthat this green little piece of paper or this bit of\ninformation, it is worth a banana. And as long as everybody\nbelieves it, it works. - So at which point does a fiction, when it's sufficiently\nuseful and effective in improving the global quality of life, does it become like accepted reality? Like there's a threshold\nin which you just manage... - If enough people believe\nit. It's like with money. You know, if you start\na new cryptocurrency, if you are the only one that\nbelieves the story, I mean, again, cryptocurrencies, you\nhave the math, of course, but ultimately it's storytelling. You're selling people a story. If nobody believes your story,\nyou don't have anything. But if lots of people\nbelieve the Bitcoin story, then Bitcoin can be\nworth thousands and tens of thousands of dollars. Again, why? I mean, you can't eat it, you\ncan't drink it, it's nothing. It's this story around the\nmath, which is the real magic. - Is it possible that\nthe story is the primary living organism, not the storyteller? - Hmm.\n- So that somehow humans, homo sapiens evolved to\nbecome these like hosts for a more intelligent living\norganism, which is the idea. And the ideas are the ones\nthat are doing the competing. So this is one of the sort\nof big perspectives behind your work that's really revolutionary of how you've seen history. But do you ever kinda take the perspective of the\nideas as the organisms versus the humans? - It's... It's an interesting idea. There are two opposite\nthings to say about it. On the one hand, yes, absolutely. If you look long term in\nhistory, all the people die. It's the stories that compete\nand survive and spread, and stories often spread\nby making people willing to sacrifice sometimes\ntheir lives for the story. You know, we know in Israel, this is one of the most important story\nfactories in human history. And this is a place where\npeople still kill each other every day over stories. I don't know, you've\nbeen to Jerusalem, right? So people like, ah, Jerusalem,\nJerusalem, Jerusalem. You go there, I've lived in\nJerusalem much of my life. You go there, it's an ordinary\nplace. You know, it's a town. You have buildings, you\nhave stones, you have trees, you have dogs and cats and pedestrians. It's a regular place. But then you have the\nstories about the place, oh, this is the place where\nGod revealed himself, this is the place where Jesus was, this is the place where Muhammad was. And it's the stories\nthat people fight over. Nobody's fighting over the stones. People are fighting about\nthe stories about the stones. And the stories... If a story can get millions\nof people to fight for it, it not only survives, it spreads, it can take over the world. The other side of the coin\nis that the stories are not really alive because\nthey don't feel anything. This goes back to the\nquestion of consciousness, which I think is the most important thing. That the ultimate\nreality is consciousness, is the ability to feel things. If you want to know whether\nthe hero of some story is real or not, you need\nto ask, can it suffer? Stories don't feel anything. Countries, which are also\nstories, nations don't suffer. If a nation loses a\nwar, it doesn't suffer. The soldiers suffer, the civilians suffer, animals can suffer, you\nhave an army with horses and whatever, and the horses get wounded, the horses suffer. The nation can't suffer. It's just an imagination. It's just a fictional story in our mind. It doesn't feel anything. Similarly, when a bank\ngoes bankrupt or company goes bankrupt, or when a\ncurrency loses its value, like Bitcoin is worth now zero, crashed, or the dollar is worth zero, it crashed. The dollar doesn't feel anything. It's the people holding\nthe dollars who might be now very miserable. So we have this complex\nsituation when history is largely driven by stories, but stories are not the ultimate reality. The ultimate reality is feeling, feelings of humans, of animals. And the tragedy of history is that very, very often we get it,\nwe get the order wrong. Stories are not bad. Stories are tools. They're good when we use them in order to alleviate suffering. But very often we forget it. We, instead of using the\nstories for our purposes, we allow the stories to\nuse us for their purposes. And then you start in entire\nwars because of a story, you inflict millions,\nsuffering on millions of people just for the sake of a story. And that's the tragedy of human history."

      "text": "- So the fundamental property of life, of a living organism\nis the capacity to feel and the ultimate feeling is suffering? - You know, to know if\nyou are happy or not, it's a very difficult question. - Yeah.\n- But when you suffer, you know.\n- Yes. - And also in ethical terms, it's more important to\nbe aware of suffering than of any other emotion. If you are doing\nsomething which is causing all kinds of emotions\nto all kinds of people, first of all, you need to\nnotice if you're causing a lot of suffering to someone. If some people are like it\nand some people are bored by it and some people are a bit angry at you and some people are suffering because of what you do, you\nfirst of all have to know, oh. Now, sometimes you still have to do it. You know, the world is a\ncomplicated place. I dunno. You have an epidemic. Governments decide to\nhave all those social isolation regulations or whatever. So in certain cases, yes, you need to do it even though it can cause tremendous suffering. But you need to be very aware\nof the cost and to be very, very, you have to ask yourself\nagain and again and again, is it worth it? Is it still worth it? - And the interesting question there, implied in your statements, is that suffering is a\npretty good component of a Turing test for consciousness. - This is the most important\nthing to ask about AI. Can it suffer? Because if AI can suffer, then it is an ethical subject\nand it needs protection. It needs rights, just\nlike humans and animals. - Well, quite a long time ago already, so I work with a lot of\nrobots, legged robots, but I've even had, inspired\nby a YouTube video, had a bunch of Roombas,\nand I made them scream when I touched them or kicked them, or when they run into a wall. And the illusion of suffering,\nfor me, silly human, that anthropomorphize\nthings is as powerful as suffering itself. I mean, you immediately\nthink the thing is suffering. And I think some of it is\njust a technical problem, but it's the easily solvable one, how to create an AI system that just says, please don't hurt me. Please don't shut me off. I miss you. Where have you been? Be jealous. Also, where have you\nbeen gone for so long? Your calendar doesn't have anything on it. So this kind of, this, create through words the\nperception of suffering, of jealousy, of anger,\nof all of those things. And it just seems like that's\nnot so difficult to do. - That's part of the danger\nthat it basically hacks our operating system and it uses some of our best qualities against us. It's very, very good\nthat humans are attuned to suffering and that we\ndon't want to cause suffering. That we have compassion. That's one of the most\nwonderful thing about humans. And if we now create AIs which\nuse this to manipulate us, this is a terrible thing. - You've kind of, I think mentioned this. Do you think it should be\nillegal to do these kinds of things with AI, to\ncreate the perception of consciousness, of saying,\nplease don't leave me? Or sort of basically simulate some of the human-like qualities? - Yes. I think, again, we have\nto be very careful about it. And if it emerges spontaneously,\nwe need to be careful. Again, we can't rule out\nthe possibility that AI will develop consciousness. We don't know enough about\nconsciousness to be sure. So if it develops spontaneously, we need to be very careful about how we understand it. But if people intentionally\ndesign an AI that they know, they assume, it has no consciousness, but in order to manipulate\npeople, they use, again, this human strength, this human, the noble part of our nature against us. This should be forbidden. And similarly, on a general level, that it should be forbidden\nfor an AI to pretend to be a human being. That it's okay, you know, there are so many things we\ncan use AIs, as teachers, as doctors and so forth. And it's good as long\nas we know that we are interacting with an AI, we should, the same way we ban fake money,\nwe should ban fake humans. It's not just banning deep\nfakes of specific individuals. It's also banning deep\nfake of generic humans. You know, which is already\nhappening to some extent on social media. Like if you have lots of\nbots retweeting something, then you have the impression, oh, lots of people are interested in that. That's important. And this is basically the\nbots pretending to be humans. Because if you see a tweet\nwhich says 500 people retweeted it, or you see\na tweet and it says 500 bots retweeted it, I don't\ncare what the bots retweeted, but if it's humans,\nokay, that's interesting. So we need to be very careful\nthat bots can't do that. They are doing it at present\nand it should be banned. Now, some people say yes, but\nfreedom of expression, no, bots don't have freedom of expression. There is no cost in terms\nof freedom of expression when you ban bots. So again, in some situations, yes, AIs should interact with us,\nbut it should be very clear, this is an AI talking to you, or this is an AI retweeting this story. It is not a human being\nmaking a conscious decision. - To push back on this\nline of fake humans. 'Cause I think it might be a spectrum. First of all, you might have\nAI systems that are offended, hurt when you say that\nthey're fake humans. In fact, they might start\nidentifying as humans. And you just talked about\nthe power of us humans with our collective intelligence\nto take fake stories and make them quite real. And so if the feelings you have\nfor the fake human is real, you know, love is a kind\nof fake thing that we all kinda put a word to a set of feelings. What if you have that\nfeeling for an AI system? It starts to change. I mean, maybe the kind of\nthings AI systems are allowed to do, for good they're allowed to create, communicate suffering,\ncommunicate it, the good stuff, the longing, the hope, the\nconnection, the intimacy, all of that. And in that way get\nintegrated in our society. And then you start to ask a\nquestion on are we allowed to really unplug them? Are we allowed to really censor them? Remove their voice from-\n- I'm not saying- - Social media. - They shouldn't have a voice. They shouldn't talk with us. I'm just saying, when they talk with us, it should be clear that they are AI. That's it. Don't... You can have your voice as an AI. Again, I have some medical problem. I want to get advice from\nan AI doctor. That's fine. As long as I know that\nI'm talking with an AI. That what should be banned\nis AI pretending to be a human being. This is something that will erode trust. And without trust, society collapses. This is something that especially will endanger democracies, because\ndemocracies are built on, democracy is a conversation basically. And it's a conversation between people. If you now flood the\npublic sphere with millions and potentially billions\nof AI agents that can hold conversations, they\nnever sleep, they never eat, they don't have emotions of their own. They can get to know you and tailor their words specifically\nfor you and your life story. They are becoming better\nthan us at creating stories and ideas and so forth. If you flood the public sphere with that, this will ruin the\nconversation between people. It will ruin the trust between people. You will no longer be\nable to have a democracy in this situation. You can have other types of\nregimes, but not democracy. - If we could talk about\nthe big philosophical notion of truth then, you've\nalready talked about these, the capacity of humans. One of the things that\nmade us special is stories. So is there such thing as truth? - Absolutely.\n- What is truth? - When somebody is suffering, that's true. I mean, this is why one of the things, when you talk about suffering as a kind of alternate reality, when\nsomebody suffers, that is truth. Now, somebody can suffer\nbecause of a fictional story. Like somebody tells people that God said, you must go on this crusade\nand kill these heretics. And this is a completely fictional story, and people believe it and they start a war and they destroy cities and kill people. The people that suffer because of that, and even the crusaders\nthemselves that also suffer the consequences of what they do, the suffering is true\neven though it is caused by a fictional story. Similarly, when people\nagree on certain rules, the rules could come\nout of our imagination. Now, we can be truthful\nabout it and say these rules, they didn't come from heaven, they came from our imagination. You know, we look at sports, so you have rules for the\ngame of football, soccer, they were invented by people. Nobody, at least very few\npeople claim that the rules of football came down from heaven. - Yes.\n- We invented them. And this is truthful. They are fictional rules\ninvented by humans. And this is true. They\nwere invented by humans. And when you are honest about\nit, it enables you to change the rules, which is being done in football every now and then. It's the same with the\nfundamental rules of a country. You can pretend that the\nrules came down from heaven, dictated by God or whatever, and then you can't change them. Or you can be like, you know,\nthe American constitution, which starts with \"We, the people.\" The American constitution lays down certain rules for a society. But the amazing thing about it, it does not pretend to come\nfrom an external source. The 10 Commandments start with, \"I am your Lord God.\" And because it starts with\nthat, you can't change them. You know, the 10th commandment, for instance, supports slavery. The 10th commandment,\nin the 10th commandment, it says that you should not\ncovet your neighbor's house or your neighbor's wife\nor your neighbor's slaves. It's okay to hold slaves\naccording to the 10th commandment. It's just bad to covet the\nslaves of your neighbor. Now there is no 11th\ncommandment which says, if you don't like some of\nthe previous 10 Commandments, this is how you go about amending them. Which is why we still have them unchanged. Now, in the US constitution\nyou have all these rights and rules, including originally\nthe ability to hold slaves. But the genius of the founding fathers of the United States,\nthey had the humility to understand maybe we\ndon't understand everything. Maybe we made some mistakes. So we tell you that these\nrules did not come from heaven, they came from us humans,\nwe may have made a mistake, so here is a mechanism\nfor how future generations can amend the constitution,\nwhich was used later on to, for instance, amend the\nConstitution to ban slavery. - So now you're describing\nsome interesting and powerful ideas\nthroughout human history. Can you just speak to the\nmechanism of how humans believe, start to believe ideas? Is there something interesting to say there from your thinking about it? Like how idea is born\nand how it takes hold and how it spreads and how\nit competes with other ideas? - First of all, ideas are an\nindependent force in history. Marxists tend to deny that. Marxists think that all\nhistory is just a play of material interests, and ideas, stories, they are just a smokescreen to hide the underlying interests. My thoughts are to some\nextent the opposite. We have some biological\nobjective interests that all humans share. Like we need to eat, we need\nto drink, we need to breathe. But most conflicts in\nhistory are not about that. The interests which\nreally drive most conflict in history don't come from biology. They come from religions\nand ideologies and stories. So it's not that stories\nare a smokescreen to hide the real interests. The stories create the\ninterests in the first place. The stories define who\nare the competing groups. Nations, religions, cultures, they are not biological entities. They're not like species like\ngorillas and chimpanzees. No. Israelis and Palestinians\nor Germans and French or Chinese and Americans, they have no essential biological\ndifference between them. The difference is cultural.\nIt comes from stories. There are people that\nbelieve in different stories. The stories create the identity, the stories create the interests. Israelis and Palestinians\nare fighting over Jerusalem not because of any material interest. There are no oil fields under\nJerusalem, and even oil, you need it to realize\nsome cultural fantasy. It doesn't really come from biology. So the stories are independent forces. Now, why do people believe\none story and not another? That's history. There\nis no materialistic law. People will always believe this... No, history is full of accidents. How did Christianity\nbecome the most successful religion in the world? We can't explain it. Why this story about Jesus of\nNazareth and not, you know, the Roman Empire in the third\ncentury CE was a bit like, I don't know, California today, like so many sects and subsects and gurus and like everybody has their own thing. - Yeah.\n- And you have, you know, thousands of different stories competing. Why did Christianity come up on top? As a historian, I don't\nhave a kind of clear answer. You can read the sources\nand you see how it happened. Oh, this happened and then this happened and then Constantine adopted it and then this and then this. But why? I don't think\nanybody has an answer to that. If you rewind the movie\nof history and press play and you rewind and press play 100 times, I think Christianity would\ntake over the Roman empire in the world maybe twice out of 100 times. It was such an unlikely thing to happen. And it's the same with Islam. It's the same, I don't know, with the communist takeover of Russia. In 1914, if you told\npeople that in three years Lenin and the Bolsheviks will gain power in Tsarist Empire, they would\nthink you're utterly crazy. You know, Lenin had a few\nthousand supporters in 1914 in an Empire of close\nto 200 million people. It sounded ludicrous. Now, we know the chain of events, the First World War, the\nFebruary Revolution and so forth that led to the communist takeover. But it was such an unlikely\nevent. And it happened. - And the little steps along the way, the little options you have\nalong the way 'cause, you know, Stalin versus Trotsky, you could have the Robert Frost poem. There's always...\n- Yes. - (laughs) Always comes to... - And history often takes, you know, there is a highway and\nthere is a kind of side way. And history takes the sideway.\n- Yeah. - Many, many times. - And it's perhaps tempting to tell some of that history through\ncharismatic leaders. And maybe it's an open question, how much power charismatic\nleaders have to affect the trajectory of history. - You've met quite a lot of\ncharismatic leaders lately. I mean, what's your view on that? - I find it a compelling notion. I'm a sucker for a great\nspeech and a vision. So I have a sense that\nthere's an importance for a leader to catalyze the\nviral spread of a story, as, so like, I think we need leaders to be just great storytellers\nthat kind of sharpen up the story to make sure it infiltrates everybody's brain effectively. But it could also be that\nthe local interactions between humans is even more important. But it's just, we don't\nhave a good way to sort of summarize that and describe that. We like to talk about, you know, Steve Jobs as central to the\ndevelopment of the computer, maybe Bill Gates. And you tell it to the stories\nof individuals like this, 'cause it's just easier to\ntell a sexy story that way. - Maybe it's an interplay\nbecause you have the kind of structural forces that, I don't know, you look at the geography\nof the planet and you look at shipping technology in late, in the late 15th century in\nEurope and the Mediterranean. And it's almost inevitable\nthat pretty quickly somebody will discover America, somebody from the Old World will\nget to the New World. So this was not a kind of, if it wasn't Columbus then\nit would've been a five years later somebody else. But the key thing about history is that these small differences make a huge, huge difference. You know, if it wasn't\nColumbus, if it was five years later somebody from\nEngland, then maybe all of Latin America today would be speaking English and not Spanish. If it was somebody from\nthe Ottoman Empire, it's completely different world history. If you have, and you know, the Ottoman Empire at that\ntime was also shaping up to be a major maritime empire. If you have America reached, being reached by Muslim navigators before Christian navigators\nfrom Europe, you have a completely different world history. It's the same with the computer. Given the economic\nincentives and the science and technology of the time, then the rise of the personal computer was probably inevitable sometime\nin the late 20th century. But the where and when is crucial. The fact that it was California\nin the 1970s and not, say, I don't know Japan in the 1980s or China in the 1990s, this\nmade a huge, huge difference. So you have this interplay\nbetween the structural forces, which are beyond the control of any single charismatic leader. But then the small changes,\nthey can have a big effect. And I think, for instance, about the war in Ukraine,\nthere was a moment, now it's a struggle between nations, but there was a moment\nwhen the decision was taken in the mind of a single\nindividual of Vladimir Putin. And he could have decided otherwise. And the world would've\nlooked completely different. - And another leader, Vladimir Zelensky, could\nhave decided to leave Kiev in the early days. There's a lot of decisions\nthat kind of ripple."

      "section": "Hitler",
      "text": "- Yeah.\n- So you write in \"Homo Deus\" about Hitler, and in part that he was not a very impressive person. - Did I say that? - The quote is, let me read it. - Okay. (laughs)\n- He wasn't a senior officer, in\nfour years of war he rose no higher than the rank of corporal. He had no formal education...\nPerhaps you mean his resume. - Yeah, yeah. His resume was\nnot impressive, that's true. - He had no formal education,\nno professional skills, no political background. He wasn't a successful\nbusinessman or a union activist. He didn't have friends or\nrelatives in high places nor any money to speak of. So how did he amass so much power? What ideology, what\ncircumstances enabled the rise of the 3rd Reich? - Hmm. Again, I can't tell you the why. I can tell you the how. I\ndon't think it was inevitable. I think that a few, if a\nfew things were different, there would've been no 3rd Reich, there would've\nbeen no Nazism, no Holocaust. Again, this is the tragedy. If it would've been\ninevitable, then, you know, what can you do? This is the laws of history\nor the laws of physics. But the tragedy is, no, it was decisions by humans\nthat led to that direction. And, you know, even from the viewpoint of the Germans, we know for a fact, it was an unnecessary path to take. 'Cause you know, in the\n1920s and 30s, the Nazis said that this, unless Germany take this road, it will never be prosperous,\nit will never be successful. All the other countries\nwill keep stepping on it. This was their claim. And we\nknow for a fact this is false. Why? Because they took that road, they lost the Second World War. And after they lost, then they became one of the\nmost prosperous countries in the world because their\nenemies that defeated them, evidently supported them and\nallowed them to become such a prosperous and successful nation. So, you know, if you can\nlose the war and still be so successful, obviously you could just have skipped the war. You didn't need it. I mean, you really had to\nhave the war in order to have a prosperous Germany in the... Absolutely not. And it's\nthe same with Japan. It's the same with Italy.\nSo it was not inevitable. It was not the forces of\nhistory that necessitated, forced Germany to take this path. I think part of it is part\nof the appeal of, again, Hitler was a very, very\nskillful storyteller. He sold people a story. The fact that he was\nnobody made it even more effective because people, at that time, after the defeat of the First World War, after the repeated economic\ncrisis of the 1920s in Germany, people felt betrayed by\nall the established elites, by all the established institutions. All these professors and politicians and industrialists and\nmilitary, all the big people. They led us to a disastrous\nwar. They led us to humiliation. So we don't want any of them. And then you have this nobody,\na corporal, with no money, with no education, with\nno titles, with nothing. And he tells people, I'm one of you. And this made him, this was one reason why he was so popular. And then the story he told, when you look at stories\nand the competition between different stories\nand between stories, fiction and the truth... The truth has two big problems. The truth tends to be\ncomplicated and the truth tends to be painful. The real story of, let's\ntalk about nations. The real story of every\nnation is complicated and it contains some painful episodes. We are not always good. We\nsometimes do bad things. Now, if you go to people and you tell them a complicated and painful story, many of them don't want to listen. The advantage of fiction\nis that it can be made as simple and as painless\nor attractive as you want it to be because it's fiction. And then what you see is that politicians, like Hitler, they create\na very simple story. We are the heroes. We\nalways do good things. Everybody's against us.\nEverybody's trying to trample us. And this is very attractive. One of the things people don't understand about Nazism and fascism, we teach in schools about fascism and Nazism as this ultimate evil, the ultimate monster in human history. And at some level this is wrong, because it make people,\nit actually exposes us. Why? 'Cause people hear, oh,\nfascism is this monster. And then when you hear\nthe actual fascist story, what fascists tell you is always very beautiful and attractive. Fascists are people who come and tell you, you are wonderful. You belong to the most\nwonderful group of people in the world. You are beautiful, you are ethical. Everything you do is good. You have never done anything wrong. There are all these evil\nmonsters out there that are out to get you. And they are causing all\nthe problems in the world. And when people hear that, you know, it's like looking in the mirror and seeing something very beautiful. Hey, I'm beautiful. We've\nnever done anything wrong. We are victims. Everybody is... And when you look and you\nheard in school that fascism, that fascists are monsters,\nand you look in the mirror, you see something very\nbeautiful and you say, I can't be a fascist because\nfascists are monsters and this is so beautiful, so it can't be. But when you look in the fascist mirror, you never see a monster. You see the most beautiful\nthing in the world. And that's the danger. This is the problem, you know,\nwith Hollywood's, you know, I look at Voldemort in\nHarry Potter, who would like to follow this creep?\n- Yeah. - And you look at Darth\nVader, this is not somebody you would like to follow. Christianity got things much\nbetter when he described the devil as being very\nbeautiful and attractive. That's the danger, that you see something is very beautiful. You don't understand\nthe monster underneath. - And you're right precisely about this. And by the way, it's just a small aside, it always saddens me when people say, how obvious it is to them that communism is a flawed ideology. When you ask them, try to put your mind, try to put yourself in the\nbeginning of the 20th century and see what you would do. A lot of people will say, it's obvious that it's a flawed ideology. So I mean, I suppose to\nsome of the worst ideologies in human history, you could say the same. And in that mirror, when you\nlook, it looks beautiful. - Communism is the same. Also, you look in the communist mirror, you are the most ethical,\nwonderful person ever. It's very difficult to\nsee Stalin underneath it. - So \"Homo Deus,\" you also write, during the 19th and 20th centuries, as humanism gained\nincreasing social credibility and political power, it sprouted two very different offshoots, socialist humanism, which encompassed a plethora of socialists and communist movements,\nand evolutionary humanism, whose most famous\nadvocates were the Nazis. So if you can just linger on that, what's the ideological connection between Nazism and communism\nas embodied by humanism? - And humanism basically is, you know, the focus is on humans, that they are the most\nimportant thing in the world. They move history. But then there is a big\nquestion, what are humans? What is humanity? Now, liberals, they place at the center of the story individual humans. And they don't see history as a kind of necessary collision between big forces. They place the individual at the center. If you want to know, you\nknow, there is a bad, especially in the US today, liberal is taken as the\nopposite of conservative. But to test whether you are liberal, you need to answer just three questions. Very simple. Do you think people should\nhave the right to choose their own government or\nthe government should be imposed by some outside force? Do you think people should have the right to the liberty to choose\ntheir own profession or either born into some\ncast that predetermines what they do? And do you think people\nshould have the liberty to choose their own\nspouse and their own way of personal life instead\nof being told by elders or parents who to marry and how to live? Now, if you answered yes\nto all three questions, people should have the liberty\nto choose their government, their profession, their\npersonal lives, their spouse, then you're a liberal. And most conservatives are also liberal. Now, communists and fascists,\nthey answer differently. For them history is not,\nyes, history is about humans. Humans are the big heroes of history, but not individual humans\nand their liberties. Fascists imagine history as a clash between races or nations. The nation is at the center. They say the supreme good\nis the good of the nation. You should have 100%\nloyalty only to the nation. You know, liberals say, yes, you should be loyal to the nation, but it's not the only thing. There are other things in\nthe world, the human rights, there is truth, there is beauty. Many times, yes, you\nshould prefer the interests of your nation over other\nthings, but not always. If your nation tells\nyou to murder millions of innocent people, you don't do that, even though the nation tells you to do it. To lie for the national interest... You know, in extreme\nsituations, maybe, but in many cases, your loyalty\nshould be to the truth, even if it makes your nation looks a bit, not in the best light,\nthe same with beauty. You know, how does the fascists determine whether a movie is a good movie? Very simple. If it serves the interest of the nation, this is a good movie. If it's against the\ninterest of the nation, this is a bad movie. End of story. Liberalism says, no,\nthere is aesthetic values in the world, we should judge movies not just on that question whether they serve the national interest, but\nalso on artistic value. Communists are a bit like the fascists, instead that they don't place\nthe nation as the main hero. They place class as the main hero. For them history, again,\nit's not about individuals, it's not about nations. History is the clash between classes. And just as fascists\nimagine in the end only one nation will be on top, the communists think in the\nend only one class should be on top. And that's the proletariat. And same story, 100% of your loyalty\nshould be to the class. And like if there is a\nclash tag between class and family, class wins. Like in the Soviet Union,\nthe party told children, if you hear your parents say something bad about Stalin, you have to report them. And there are many cases\nwhen children reported their parents and their\nparents were sent to the Gulag. Like, and you know, your\nloyalty is to the party, which leads the proletariat to victory in the historical struggle. And the same way in communism, art is only about class struggle, and\nmovie's good if it serves the interest of the proletariat. Artistic values? There\nis nothing like that. And the same with truth. Everything that we see now\nin fake news, you know, the communist propaganda\nmachine was there before us. The level of lies, of disinformation campaigns\nthat they orchestrated in the 1920s and '30s and\n'40s is really unimaginable. - So the reason these two ideologies, classes of ideologies failed\nis the sacrifice the truth, not just failed, but did a lot of damage, is sacrifice the truth\nand sacrifice the beauty. - And sacrifice of hundreds\nof millions of people. Disregard, again, for human suffering. Like, okay, for, in order\nto, for our nation to win, in order for our class to win, we need to kill those\nmillions, kill those millions. That was an ethics, aesthetics,\ntruth... They don't matter. The only thing that matter\nis the victory of the state or the victory of the class. And that's the, liberalism\nwas the antithesis to that. It says, no, not only it's, it has a much more\ncomplicated view of the world and both communism and fascism. They have a very simple view of the world. There is one, your loyalty, 100% of it should be only to one thing. Now, liberalism has a much\nmore complex view of the world. It says, yes, there are\nnations, they are important. Yes, there are classes,\nthey are important. But they are not the only thing. There are also families,\nthere are also individuals. There are also animals. And your loyalty should be\ndivided between all of them. Sometimes you prefer this,\nsometimes you prefer that. That's complicated. And, but,\nyou know, life is complicated. - But also, I think\nmaybe you can correct me, but liberalism acknowledges\nthe corrupting nature of power, when there's a guy at the top, sits there for a while, managing things, he is probably gonna\nstart losing a good sense of reality and losing the\ncapability to be a good manager. It feels like the communist\nand fascist regimes don't acknowledge that\nbasic characteristic of human nature, that power corrupts. - Yes. They believe in infallibility. - Yeah.\n- They're, in this sense, they're very close to being religions. In Nazism, Hitler was\nconsidered infallible, and therefore you don't\nneed any checks and balances on his power. Why do you need to balance\nan infallible genius? And it's the same with the Soviet Union with\nStalin and more generally with the Communist party, the Party can never make a mistake, and therefore you don't\nneed independent courts, independent media, opposition\nparties, things like that. Because the Party is never wrong. You concentrate the same way, 100% of loyalty should be to the Party, 100% of power should be\nin the hands of the Party. The whole idea of liberal democracy is embracing fallibility. Everybody is fallible. All people or leaders or\npolitical parties or institutions. This is why we need checks and balances, and we need many of them. If you have just one, then this particular check itself could make terrible mistakes. So you need, say, you need a press, you need the media to serve\nas a check to the government. You don't have just one\nnewspaper or one TV station. We need many, so that they\ncan balance each other. And the media's not enough. So if you have independent courts. You have free academic\ninstitutions. You have NGOs. You have a lot of checks and balances. - So that's the ideologies\nand the leaders. What about the individual people, the millions of people\nthat play a part in all of this that are the hosts of the stories that are the catalyst and the\nsort of the components of how the story spreads. Would you say that all of\nus are capable of spreading any story, sort of the Solzhenitsyn idea of that all of us are\ncapable of good and evil. The line between good and evil\nruns the heart of every man. - Yes. I wouldn't say that\nevery person is capable of every type of evil,\nbut we are all fallible. There is a large element... It partly depends on the\nefforts we make to develop our self-awareness during life. Part of it depends on moral luck. You know, if you are born as a Christian German\nin the 1910s or 1920s, and you grow up in Nazi\nGermany, that's bad moral luck. Your chances of committing\nterrible things, you have a very high chance of doing it. And you can withstand it, but it'll will take tremendous effort. If you are born in Germany after the war, you are morally lucky\nthat you will not be put to such a test. You will not need to exert\nthese enormous efforts not to commit atrocities. So there is an, this is\njust part of history. There is an element of luck. But again, part of it\nis also self-awareness."

      "section": "Benjamin Netanyahu",
      "text": "And you asked me earlier\nabout the potential of power to corrupt. And I listened to the\ninterview you just did with Prime Minister Netanyahu\na couple of days ago. And one of the things that most struck me during the interview that\nyou asked him, you asked him, are you afraid of this\nthing, that power corrupts? He didn't think for a single second. He didn't pose, he didn't\nadmit a tiny little level of, you know, a doubt or... No. Power doesn't corrupt. It was, for me, it was a\nshocking and a revealing moment. And it kind of dovetails with\nhow you began the interview, that I really liked your\nopening gambit, that, kind of... No, really, you kind\nof told him, you know, lots of people in the\nworld are angry with you. Some people hate you. They dislike you. What do you want to tell\nthem, to say to them? And you gave him this kind of platform. And I was very, what will he\nsay? And he just denied it. He basically denied it. You know, he had to\ncut short the interview from three hours to one\nhour because he had hundreds of thousands of Israelis in the streets demonstrating against him. And he goes and saying,\nno, everybody likes me. What are you talking about? - But on that topic, you've said recently that the Prime Minister,\nBenjamin Netanyahu, may go down in history as the\nman who destroys Israel. Can you explain what you mean by that? - Yes. I mean, he is basically\ntearing apart the social contract that held this\ncountry together for 75 years. He's destroying the foundations\nof Israeli democracy. You know, I don't want to go too deep, and unless you want it, because I guess most of our listeners, they have bigger issues on\ntheir minds than the fate of some small country in the Middle East. But for those who want to\nunderstand what's happening in Israel, there is really\njust one question to ask. What limits the power of the government? In United States, for instance, there are lots of checks\nand balances that limit the power of the government. You have the Supreme Court, you have the Senate, you have the\nHouse of Representative, you have the President,\nyou have the Constitution, you have 50 states,\neach state with its own Constitution and Supreme Court\nand Congress and Governor... If somebody wants to pass a\ndangerous legislation, say, in the House, it will have to go through so many obstacles... Like if you want to pass\na law in United States, taking away voting rights from Jews or from Muslims or from African-Americans, even if it passes, even\nif it has a majority in the House of Representatives,\nit has a very, very, very small chance of becoming\nthe law of the country. Because it'll have to pass again through the Senate, through the President, through the Supreme Court and all the federal structure. In Israel, we have just a\nsingle check on the power of the government. And that's the Supreme Court. There is really no difference\nbetween the government and the legislature,\nbecause whoever there is, there are no separate\nelections like in the US. If you win majority in the\nKnesset, in the Parliament, you appoint the government. That's very simple. And if you have 61 members of Knesset who vote, let's say, on a law to take away voting\nrights from Arab citizens of Israel, there is a single\ncheck that can prevent it from becoming the law of the land. And that's the Supreme Court. And now the Netanyahu government is trying to neutralize or take over the Supreme Court, and\nthey've already prepared a long list of laws. They already talk about it. What will happen the\nmoment that this last check on the power is gone, they are openly trying\nto gain unlimited power. And they openly talk about\nit, that once they have it, then they will take away the rights of Arabs, of LGBT people,\nof women, of secular Jews. And this is why you have\nhundreds of thousands of people in the streets. You have air force pilots saying, we stopped flying. This is unheard of in Israel. I mean, we are still living\nunder existential threat from Iran, from other enemies. And in the middle of this, you have air force pilots\nwho dedicated their lives to protecting the country. And they're saying, that's it. If this government doesn't\nstop what it is doing, we stop flying. - So, as you said, I just did the interview\nand as we were doing the interview, there's\nprotests in the streets. Do you think the protests\nwill have an effect? - I hope so very much. I'm\ngoing to many of these protests. I hope they will have an effect. If we fail, this is the end of\nIsraeli democracy, probably. This will have repercussions far beyond the borders of Israel. Israel is a nuclear power. Israel has one of the most advanced cyber capabilities in the world, able to strike basically\nanywhere in the world. If this country becomes a fundamentalist and militarist dictatorship,\nit can set fire to the entire Middle East. It can, again, have\ndestabilizing effects long, far beyond the borders of Israel. - So you think without the\ncheck on power is possible that the Netanyahu government\nholds on to power... - Nobody tries to gain unlimited\npower just for nothing. I mean, you have so many problems in Israel, and Netanyahu talks so much about Iran and the\nPalestinians and Hezbollah. We have an economic crisis. Why is it so urgent at this moment, in the face of such opposition, why is it so crucial\nfor them to neutralize the Supreme Court? They're just doing it for the fun of it? No, they know what they are doing. they are adamant, again, we\nare not sure of it before. There was a, like a couple of months ago, they came out with this plan to take over the Supreme Court,\nto have all these laws. And there were hundreds\nof thousands of people in the streets, again, soldiers saying they will stop serving, a general strike in the economy. And they stopped. And they started a process\nof negotiations to try and enrich a settlement. And then they broke down, they stopped the negotiations\nand they restarted this process of legislation\ntrying to gain unlimited power. So any doubt we had before, okay, maybe they changed their purposes. No, it's now very clear. They are 100% focused on\ngaining absolute power. They are not trying a different tactic. Previously they took,\nthey had all these dozens of laws that they wanted\nto pass very quickly, within a month or two,\nthey realized, no, this is, there is too much opposition. So now they're doing what\nis known as salami tactics, slice by slice. Now they're trying to,\none law, if this succeeds, then they'll pass the\nnext one and the next one and the next one. This is why we are now\nat a very crucial moment. And when you see, again, hundreds of thousands\nof people in the streets almost every day, when\nyou're seeing resistance within the armed forces,\nwithin the security forces, you see high tech companies\nsay, we will go on strike. You know, it's our private\nbusinesses, high tech companies. I think it's almost unprecedented for a private business\nto go on strike because what will economic success\nbenefit us if we live under a messianic dictatorship? And again, the fuel for\nthis whole thing is, to a large extent, coming from\nMessianic religious groups, which, just the thought, what happens if these people\nhave unlimited control of Israel's nuclear arsenal and Israel's military capabilities\nand cyber capabilities. This is very, very scary. Not just for the citizens of Israel. It should be scary for people everywhere. - So it would be scary\nfor it to go from being a problem of security\nand protecting the peace to becoming a religious war. - It is already becoming a religious war. I mean, the war, the conflict with the\nPalestinians was for many years a national conflict, in essence. Over the last few years,\nmaybe a decade or two, it is morphing into religious\nconflict, which is again, a very worrying development. When nations are in conflict, you can reach some compromise. Okay, you have this bit of\nland, we have this bit of land. But when it becomes a religious conflict between fundamentalists,\nbetween messianic people, compromise becomes much more difficult because you don't compromise on eternity. You don't compromise on God. And this is where we\nare heading right now. - So I know you said it's\na small nation somewhere in the Middle East, but\nit also happens to be the epicenter of one\nof the longest running, one of the most tense conflicts and crises in human history. So at the very least, it serves as a study of how\nconflict can be resolved. So what are the biggest obstacles to you to achieving peace\nin this part of the world? - Motivation. I think it's easy to\nachieve peace if you have the motivation on both sides. Unfortunately at the present juncture, there is not enough\nmotivation on either side, either the Palestinian or Israeli side. Peace, you know, in\nmathematics you have problems without solutions, you\ncan prove mathematically that this mathematical\nproblem has no solution. In politics, there is no such thing. All problems have solutions\nif you have the motivation. And, but motivation is the big problem. And again, we can go into the reasons why, but the fact is that on neither side is there enough motivation. If there was motivation, the\nsolution would've been easy. - Is there an important\ndistinction to draw between the people on the\nstreet and the leaders in power in terms of motivation? So are most people motivated and hoping for peace and the leaders are\nmotivated and incentivized to continue war? - I don't think so.\n- Or the people also? - I think it's a deep\nproblem. It's also the people. It's not just the leaders. - Is it even a human\nproblem of literally hate in people's heart? - Yeah, there is a lot of hate. One of the things that happened\nin Israel over the last 10 years or so, Israel became much stronger\nthan it was before, largely thanks to\ntechnological developments. And it feels that it no\nlonger needs to compromise. That again, this is, there\nare many reasons for it, but some of them are technological. Being one of the leading powers in cyber, in AI, in high tech, we have developed very\nsophisticated ways to more easily control the Palestinian population. In the early 2000s, it seemed that it is becoming\nimpossible to control millions of people against their will. It took too much power, it spilled too much blood on both sides. So there was an impression,\noh, this is becoming untenable. And there were several\nreasons why it changed, but one of them was new technology. Israel developed very sophisticated surveillance technology\nthat has made it much easier for Israeli security forces to control 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank against their will, with a lot less effort,\nless boots on the ground, also less blunt. And Israel is also now\nexporting this technology to many other regimes around the world. Again, I heard Netanyahu\nspeaking about all the wonderful things that Israel\nis exporting to the world. And it's true, we are\nexporting some nice things, water systems and new kinds of tomatoes. We are also exporting a lot of weapons and especially surveillance systems, sometimes to unsavory regimes, in order to control their populations. - Can you comment on, I think you've mentioned\nthat the current state of affairs is the defacto\nthree class state. Can you describe what you mean by that? - Yes. For many years, the\nkind of leading solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the two-state solution. - Can you describe what\nthat means, by the way? - Yes. Two states within,\nbetween the Jordan River, and the Mediterranean,\nwe'll have two states. Israel is a predominantly Jewish state, and Palestine is a\npredominantly Palestinian state. Again, there were lots of discussions where the border passes, what happens with security\narrangement and whatever. But this was the big solution. Israel is basically abandoned\nthe two-state solution. Maybe they don't say so\nofficially, the people in power, but in terms of how they actually, what they do on the\nground, they abandoned it. Now they are effectively\npromoting the three class solution, which means\nthere is just one country and one government and one power between the Mediterranean\nand the Jordan River. But you have three classes\nof people living there. You have Jews, who enjoy\nfull rights, all the rights. You have some Arabs who\nare Israeli citizens and have some rights. And then you have the other\nArabs, the third class who have basically no civil rights and limited human rights. And that's, again, nobody\nwould openly speak about it. But effectively, this is the\nreality on the ground already. - So there's many, and I'll speak with the\nPalestinians who characterize this as a defacto one state apartheid. So you agree with this?\n- I would take issue, I would take issue with\nthe term apartheid. Generally speaking as a historian, I don't really like historical analogies because there are always differences. Key differences. The biggest difference\nbetween the situation here and the situation in\nSouth Africa in the time of the apartheid is that\nthe black South Africans did not deny the existence of\nSouth Africa and did not call for the destruction of South Africa. They had a very simple goal.\nThey had a very simple demand. We want to be equal citizens\nof this country. That's it. And the apartheid regime was, no, you can't be equal citizens. Now in Israel-Palestine, it's different. The Palestinians, many\nof them don't recognize the existence of Israel, are not willing to recognize it. And they don't demand to\nbe citizens of Israel. They demand, some of them\nto destroy it and replace it with the Palestinians state, some of them demand a separate state. But you know, if the\nPalestinians would adopt the same policy as the\nblack South Africans, if you have the Palestinians coming and saying, okay, forget about it. We don't want to destroy Israel. We don't know a Palestinian country. We have a very simple\nrequest, very simple demand. Give us our full rights. We also want to vote to the Knesset. We also want to get the\nfull protection of the law. That's it. That's our only demand. Israel will be in deep-deep\ntrouble at that moment, but we are not there. - I wonder if there will\never be a future when such a thing happens, where everybody,\nthe majority of people, Arab and Jew, Israeli and\nPalestinian, accept the one state solution and say,\nwe want equal rights. - Never say never in history. It's not coming any time\nsoon from either side. When you look at the long term of history, one of the curious things you see, and that what makes us different, human groups from animal\nspecies, you know, gorillas and chimpanzees,\nthey're separate species. They can never merge. Cats\nand dogs will never merge. But different national and\nreligious groups in history, even when they hate each\nother, surprisingly, they sometimes end by merging. If you look at Germany, for instance, so for centuries you had\nPrussians and Bavarians and Saxons who fought\neach other ferociously and hated each other. And there are sometimes\nalso different religions, Catholics, Protestants, you know, the worst war in European history, according to some measures, was not the Second World\nWar or the First World War. It was the 30 years war, waged largely on German soil, between Germans,\nProtestants and Catholics. But eventually they united\nto form a single country. You saw the same thing,\nI don't know, in Britain. English and Scotts for\ncenturies hated and fought each other ferociously,\neventually coming together. Maybe it'll break up again, I don't know. But the power of the kind of\nforces of merger in history, you are very often influenced\nby the people you fight, by the people you even hate more than by almost anybody else."

      "section": "Peace in Ukraine",
      "text": "- So if we apply those ideas, the ideas of this part of the world, to another part of the world\nthat's currently in war, Russia and Ukraine, from\nwhat you learned here, how do you think peace can\nbe achieved in Ukraine? - Oh, this can be achieved\nany moment. It's motivation. In this case, it's just one person. You just, Putin just\nneed to say, that's it. You know, the Ukrainians,\nthey don't demand anything from Russia, just go home. That's the only thing they want. They don't want to conquer\nany bit of Russian territory. They don't want to change the\nregime in Moscow, nothing. They just tell the Russians,\ngo home. That's it. And of course, again, motivation. How do you get somebody like\nPutin to admit that he made a colossal mistake, a human\nmistake, an ethical mistake, a political mistake in starting this war, this is very, very difficult. But in terms of what would\nthe solution look like? Very simple. The Russians\ngo home, end of story. - Do you believe in the\npower of conversation between leaders, to sit down\nas human beings and agree, first of all, what home means? Because we humans draw lines. - That's true. I believe in\nthe power of conversation. The big question to ask is\nwhere, where do conversations, real conversations take place? And this is tricky. One of the interesting things\nto ask about any conflict, about any political system is where do the real conversations take place? And very often they don't\ntake place in the places you think that they are. But think about American politics. When the country was founded\nin the late 18th century, people understood holding\nconversation between leaders is very important for the\nfunctioning of democracy, we'll create a place for that. That's called Congress. This is where leaders are\nsupposed to meet and talk about the main issues of the day. Maybe there was a time, sometime in the past when\nthis actually happened, when you had two factions\nholding different ideas about foreign policy or economic policy, and they met in Congress\nand somebody would come and give a speech and the\npeople all on the other side would say, hey, that's interesting. I haven't thought about it.\nYes, maybe we can agree on that. This is no longer happening in Congress. Nobody, I don't think there is any speech in Congress that causes\nanybody on the other side to change their opinion about anything. So this is no longer a place where real conversations take place. The big question about American democracy is is there a place\nwhere real conversations, which actually change people's\nminds, still take place? If not, then this democracy is dying also. Democracy without conversation\ncannot exist for long. And it's the same question\nyou should ask also about dictatorial regimes. Like you think about Russia or China. So China has the Great Hall of the People, where the representatives,\nthe supposed representative of the people meet every now and then, but no real conversation\ntakes place there. A key question to ask about\nthe Chinese system is, behind closed doors, let's say,\nin a public bureau meeting, do people have a real conversation? If Xi Jinping says one\nthing and some other big shot thinks differently,\nwill they have the courage, the ability, the backbone to\nsay, with all due respect, they think differently and\nthere is a real conversation? Or not? I don't know the answer. But this is a key question. This is the difference, you know, between an authoritarian\nregime can still have different voices within it, but at\na certain point you have a personality cult. Nobody dares say anything\nagainst the leader. And when it comes again to Ukraine and Russia, I\ndon't think that if you get, if you somehow managed to get Putin and Zelensky to the same room, when everybody knows that they\nare there and they'll have a moment of empathy, of human connection and they'll have a... No, I don't think it can happen like that. I do hope that there are\nother spaces where somebody like Putin can still have\na real human conversation. I don't know if this\nis the case. I hope so. - Well, there's several\ninteresting dynamics and you spoke to some of them. So one is internally, with advisors, you have to have hope that there's people that would disagree, that would have a lively\ndebate internally. Then there's also the thing you mentioned, which is direct communication between Putin and Zelensky in\nprivate, picking up a phone, rotary phone, old school. That's, I still believe\nin the power of that. But while that's exceptionally difficult in the current state of affairs. What's also possible to\nhave is a mediator like the United States or some other leader... - Yeah.\n- Like the leader of Israel or the leader of another nation that's\nrespected by both, or India, for example, that can have first of all\nindividual conversations and then literally get\ninto a room together. - It is possible. I would say more generally\nabout conversations as it goes back a little\nto what I said earlier about the Marxist view of history. One of the problematic\nthings I see today in many academic circles is that\npeople focus too much on power. They think that the whole\nof history or the whole of politics is just a power structure. It's just struggle about power. Now, if you think that\nthe whole of history and the whole of politics is only power, then there is no room for conversation. Because if what you have is a struggle between different powerful interests, there is no point talking. The only thing that\nchanges it is fighting. My view is that, no, it's not\nall about power structures. It's not all about power dynamics. Underneath the power\nstructure there are stories, stories in human minds,\nand this is great news, if it's true, this is good\nnews because unlike power, that can only be changed\nthrough fighting, stories can, sometimes, it's not easy, but sometimes stories can\nbe changed through talking and that's the hope. I think, you know, in everything from couple\ntherapy to nation therapy, if you think it's power\ntherapy, it's all about power, there is no place for a conversation. But if to some extent it's\nthe stories in people mind... If you can enable one\nperson to see the story in the mind of another\nperson, and more importantly, if you can have some\nkind of critical distance from the story in your own mind, maybe you can change it a little, and then you don't need to fight. You can actually find a\nbetter story that you can both agree to. It sometimes happens in\nhistory, you know, again, French and Germans fought for\ngenerations and generations, now they live in peace,\nnot because, I don't know, if they found a new planet they can share between France and Germany\nso now everybody has an enough territory. No, they actually have less territory than previously because they lost all their overseas empires. But they managed to find a\nstory, the European story, that both Germans and French\npeople are happy with. So they live in peace. - I very much believe in\nthis vision that you have of the power of stories. And one of the tools is\nconversations. Another is books. There's some guy that\nwrote a book about this, power of stories. He happens to be sitting in front of me. And that happened to spread\nacross a lot of people. And now they believe in the\npower of story and narrative. Even a children's book,\ntoo. So the kids... I mean, it's fascinating how that spreads. I mean, underneath your\nwork there's an optimism. And I think underneath\nconversations is what I try to do is an optimism. That it's not just about power struggles, it's about stories, which\nis like a connection between humans and together, kinda evolving these\nstories that maximize, or minimize suffering in the world. - Yeah, this is why I also, I think I admire what you are doing, that you're going to talk\nwith some of the most difficult characters\naround in the world today. And with this basic belief\nthat by talking maybe we can move them an inch, which is a lot when it comes\nto people with so much power. Like I think one of the\nbiggest success stories in modern history, I\nwould say, is feminism. Because feminism believed\nin the power of stories, not so much in the power of\nviolence, of armed conflict. By many measures, feminism has been maybe the most successful social\nmovement of the 20th century and maybe of the modern age, you know, systems of oppression, which were in place throughout the world\nfor thousands of years. And they seem to be just natural, eternal. You had all these religious movements, all these political revolutions, and one thing remained constant, and this is the patriarchal system and the oppression of women. And then feminism came\nalong and, you know, you had leaders like\nLenin, like Mao, saying that if you want to make\na big social change, you must use violence. Power comes from the barrel of a gun. If you want to make an omelet,\nyou need to break eggs, and all these things. And the feminists said, no, we won't use the power of the gun. We will make an omelet\nwithout breaking any eggs. And they made a much better omelet than Lenin or Mao or any of\nthese violent revolutionaries. I don't think, you know, that... They certainly didn't start\nany wars or built any gulags. I don't think they even\nmurdered a single politician. I don't think there was\nany political assassination anywhere, by feminists. There was a lot of violence against them, both verbal but also physical. And they didn't reply by waging violence. And they succeeded in changing\nthis deep in structure of oppression in a way which\nbenefited not just women, but also men. So this gives me hope that it's not easy, in many cases we fail, but it is possible sometimes\nin history to make a very, very big change, positive change, mainly by talking and\ndemonstrating and changing the story in people's minds,\nand not by using violence. - It's fascinating that\nfeminism and communism and all these things\nhappen in the 20th century. So many interesting things\nhappen in the 20th century. So many movements, so many\nideas, nuclear weapons, all of it, computers. It's just like, it seems\nlike a lot of stuff like really quickly percolated. And it's accelerating. - It's still accelerating. I mean, history is just\naccelerating, you know, for centuries and the\n20th century, you know, we squeezed into it the\nthing that previously took thousands of years. And now, I mean, we are\nsqueezing it into decades. - And you very well could be\none of the last historians, human historians, to have ever lived. - Could be. I think, you know, our\nspecies, homo sapiens, I don't think we'll be\naround in a century or two. We could destroy ourselves\nin a nuclear war, through ecological collapse,\nby giving too much power to AI that goes out of our control. But if we survive, we'll probably have so\nmuch power that we will change ourselves using\nvarious technologies so that our descendants will no longer be homo sapiens like us. They will be more different\nfrom us than we are different from Neanderthals. So maybe they'll have historians, but it will no longer be human historians or sapiens historians like me. I think it's an extremely\ndangerous development. And the chances that this will go wrong, that people will use the new technologies trying to upgrade humans, but actually downgrading them. This is a very, very big danger. If you let corporations and armies and ruthless politicians\nchange humans using tools like AI and bioengineering, it's\nvery likely that they will try to enhance a few human\nqualities that they need, like intelligence and discipline, while neglecting what are\npotentially more important human qualities like compassion, like artistic sensitivity,\nlike spirituality. If you give Putin, for instance, bioengineering and AI and\nbrain computer interfaces, he's likely to want to create\na race of super soldiers who are much more intelligent\nand much more stronger and also much more\ndisciplined and never rebel and march on Moscow against him. But he has no interest in making them more compassionate or more spiritual. So the end result could\nbe a new type of humans, a downgraded humans who\nare highly intelligent and disciplined, but have no compassion\nand no spiritual depth. And this is one, for me, this\nis, you know, the dystopia, the apocalypse, that when people talk about the new technologies and\nthey have this scenario of, you know, the Terminator,\nrobots running in the street, shooting people, this\nis not what worries me. I think we can avoid that. What really worries me is\nusing the corporations, armies, politicians will use the new\ntechnologies to change us in a way which will destroy\nour humanity or the best parts of our humanity. - And one of those ways could\nbe removing the compassion. Another way that really\nworries me for me is probably more likely is a \"Brave\nNew World\" kind of thing that sort of removes the flaws of humans. Maybe it removes the diversity in humans. And makes us all kind of\nthese dopamine chasing creatures that just kind\nof maximize enjoyment in the short term. Which kind of seems like\na good thing, maybe, in the short term, but\nit creates a society that doesn't think, that doesn't create, that just is sitting there enjoying itself, at\na more and more rapid pace, which seems like another\nkind of society that could be easily controlled by a center of power. But the set of dystopias\nthat we could arrive at through this, to rely on\ncorporations to modify humans is vast and we should\nbe worried about that. So it seems like humans\nare pretty good, as we are. All the flaws, all of it together. - We are better than anything that we can intentionally design at present. - Yeah.\n- Like any intentionally designed humans, at the present\nmoment, is going to be much, much worse than us. 'Cause basically we don't\nunderstand ourselves. I mean, as long as we don't\nunderstand our brain, our body, our mind, it's a very, very bad idea to start\nmanipulating a system that you don't understand deeply and we don't understand ourselves."

      "section": "Conspiracy theories",
      "text": "- So I have to ask you\nabout an interesting dynamic of stories. You wrote an article two years ago titled, \"When the World Seems\nLike One Big Conspiracy: How understanding the structure of global cabal theories can\nshed light on their allure and their inherent falsehood.\" What are global cabal\ntheories and why do so many people believe them? 37% of Americans, for example. - Well, the global cabal\ntheory, it has many variations, but basically there is\na small group of people, a small cabal that secretly\ncontrols everything that is happening in the world. All the wars, all the\nrevolutions, all the epidemics, everything that is happening is controlled by this very small group\nof people who are of course evil and have bad intentions. And this is a very well known\nstory that it's not new, it's been there for thousands of years. It's very attractive, because\nfirst of all, it's simple. You don't have to understand everything that happens in the world, you just need to understand one thing. The war in Ukraine, the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, 5G technology, COVID-19, it's simple. There is this global cabal. They do all of it, all of it. And also it enables you to\nshift all the responsibility to all the bad things that are happening in the\nworld to this small cabal. It's the Jews, it's the\nFreemasons, it's not us. And also it creates this\nfantasy, utopian fantasy. If we only get rid of the small cabal, we solved all the problems of the world. Salvation. The Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict, the war in Ukraine, the epidemics, poverty, everything is solved just by\nknocking out this small cabal. So, and it's simple, it's attractive, and this is why so many people believe it. It's, again, it's not new.\nNazism was exactly this. Nazism began as a conspiracy theory. We don't call Nazism a\nconspiracy theory because, oh, it's a big thing, it's an ideology. But if you look at it,\nit's a conspiracy theory. The basic Nazi idea was,\nthe Jews control the world, get rid of the Jews, you solved\nall the world's problems. Now, the interesting thing\nabout these kind of theories, again, they tell you that\neven things that look to be the opposite of each other, actually they are part of the conspiracy. So in the case of Nazism, the\nNazis told people, you know, you have capitalism and communism, you think that they are opposite, right? Ah, this is what the\nJews want you to think. Actually, the Jews control both communism, Trotski, Marx were Jews, blah, blah, blah. And capitalism, the Rothschilds, the Wall Street, it's all\ncontrolled by the Jews. So the Jews are fooling everybody, but actually the communists\nand the capitalists are part of the same global cabal. And again, this is very\nattractive because, ah, now I understand everything\nand I also know what to do. I just give power to Hitler.\nHe gets rid of the Jews. I solve all the problems of the world. Now, as a historian, the most important thing I\ncan say about these theories, they are never right, because the global cabal\ntheory says two things. First, everything is\ncontrolled by a very small number of people. Secondly, these people hide themselves. They do it in secret. Now,\nboth things are nonsense. It's impossible for people\nto control, a small group of people, to control\nand predict everything because the world is too complicated. You know, you look at a\nreal world conspiracy. Conspiracy is basically just a plan. Think about the American\ninvasion of Iraq in 2003. You had the most powerful\nsuperpower in the world, with the biggest military, with the biggest intelligence services, with the most sophisticated, you know, the FBI and the CIA and all the agents. They invade a third rate country,\na third rate power, Iraq. With this idea, we'll take\nover Iraq and we'll control it, we'll make a new order in the Middle East. And everything falls apart.\nTheir plan completely backfires. Everything they hope to achieve,\nthey achieve the opposite. America, United States is humiliated. They cause the rise of ISIS. They wanted to take out terrorism. They created more terrorism. Worst of all, the big\nwinner of the war was Iran. You know, the United\nStates goes to war with all its power and gives Iran a\nvictory on a silver plate. The Iranians don't need to do anything. The Americans are doing\neverything for them. Now, this is real history. Real history is when you\nhave not a small group of people, a lot of people\nwith a lot of power, carefully planning something,\nand it goes completely out of, against their plan. And this we know from\na personal experience, like every time we try to plan something, a birthday party, a\nsurprise birthday party, a trip somewhere, things go wrong. This is reality. So the idea that a small\ngroup of, I don't know, the Jewish cabal, the Freemasons, whoever, they can really control\nand predict all the wars? This is nonsense. The second thing that is\nnonsense is to think they can do that and still remain secret. It sometimes happens in\nhistory that a small group of people accumulates a lot of power. If I now tell you that\nXi Jinping and the heads of the CCP, the Chinese\nCommunist Party, they have a lot of power. They control the military,\nthe media, the economy, the universities of China. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is, obviously, everybody\nknows it. Everybody knows it. Because to gain so much power,\nyou usually need publicity. Hitler could not, Hitler\ngained a lot of power in Nazi Germany because\nhe had a lot of publicity. If Hitler remained unknown,\nworking behind the scenes, he would not gain power. So the way to gain power is\nusually through publicity. So secret cabals don't gain power. And even if you gain a lot of power, nobody has the kind of\npower necessary to predict and control everything\nthat happens in the world. All the time shit happens that you did not predict and you did not plan\nand you did not control. - The sad thing is there's\nusually an explanation for everything you just said that involves a secret global cabal. That the reason your\nvacation planning always goes wrong is because you're not competent. There is a competent small group, that ultra competent small group. I hear this with intelligence agencies. The CIA are running everything. Mossad is running everything. - You see, I mean, as historian, you get to know how many\nblunders these people do. They are so, and they're capable, but they're so incompetent\nin so many ways. Again, look at the Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine. Before the war, people thought, oh, Putin was such a genius and\nthe Russian army was one of the strongest armies in the world. This is what Putin thought,\nand it completely backfired. - Well, a cabal\nexplanation there would be, there's a NATO driven\nUnited States military industrial complex that\nwants to create chaos and- - So they put a gun to\nPutin's head and told him, Vladimir, if you don't\ninvade, we shoot you. How did they cause put into invade? - It's the thing about conspiracy theories is there's usually a way\nto explain everything. - You can explain, it's\nkind of a religion. You can always find\nexplanation for everything. And, you know, in the end,\nit's intellectual integrity. If you insist on whenever people confront you with evidence, with finding some very, very complicated explanation for that too, you can explain everything. We know that. It's a question\nof intellectual integrity. And I will also say another\nthing, the conspiracy theories, they do get one thing right,\ncertainly in today's world, I think they represent an\nauthentic and justified fear of a lot of people that\nthey are losing control of their lives. They don't understand what is happening. And this I think is not\njust a legitimate fear. This is an important fear. They are right. We are losing control of our lives. We are facing really big dangers, but not from a small\ncabal of fellow humans. The problem with many of\nthese conspiracy theories that yes, we have a problem\nwith new AI technology, but if you now direct the\nfire against certain people, so instead of all humans\ncooperating against our real common threats, whether it's the rise of AI,\nwhether it's global warming, you are only causing\nus to fight each other. And I think that the\nkey question that people who spread these ideas,\nI mean many of them, they honestly believe, it's not malicious, that they honestly\nbelieve in these theories, is do you want to spread,\nto spend your life spreading hate towards people or do you want to work on more constructive projects? I think one of the big differences between those who believe\nin conspiracy theories and people who warn about the dangers of AI, the dangers of climate change. We don't see certain\nhumans as evil and hateful. The problem isn't humans, the problem is something outside humanity. Yes, humans are\ncontributing to the problem, but ultimately the enemy\nis external to humanity. Whereas conspiracy theories usually claim that a certain part of humanity\nis the source of all evil, which leads them to\neventually think in terms of exterminating this part of humanity, which leads sometimes to\nhistorical disasters like Nazism. - So it can lead to hate, but it can also lead to a\nlike cynicism and apathy that basically says, it's\nnot in my power to make the world better. So you don't actually take action. - I think it is within the\npower of every individual to make the world a little bit better. You know, you can't do everything. Don't try to do everything. Find one thing in your areas of activity, a place where you have\nsome agency and try to do that and hope that other\npeople do their bit. And if everybody do\ntheir bit, we'll manage. And if we don't, we don't,\nbut at least we try. - You have been part\nof conspiracy theories, I find myself recently becoming part of conspiracy theories. Is there a device you can give\nof how to be a human being in this world that values truth and reason while watching yourself become\npart of conspiracy theories? At least from my perspective, it seems very difficult\nto prove to the world that you're not part\nof a conspiracy theory. I, as you said, have interviewed Benjamin\nNetanyahu recently. I don't know if you're aware, but doing such things will also, you know, pick up a new\nmenu of items that you're, new set of conspiracy\ntheories you're now a part of. And I find it very\nfrustrating because it makes it very difficult to respond, because I sense that people\nhave the right intentions. Like we said, they have\nnervousness, a fear of power. - Yes.\n- And the abuses of power. And... As do I. So I find myself in a difficult position that I have nothing to show\nto prove that I'm not part of such a conspiracy theory. - I think ultimately you can't, we can't. I mean, you know, it's\nlike proving consciousness, you can't, that's just the situation, whatever you say can\nand will be used against you by some people.\n- Yeah. - So this fantasy, if I only say this, if I only show them that,\nif I only have this data, they will see I'm okay.\n- Yeah. - It doesn't work like that. I think to keep your\nsanity in this situation, first of all, it's important\nto understand that most of these people are not evil. They are not doing it on purpose. Many of them really\nbelieve that there is some very nefarious, powerful\nconspiracy which is causing a lot of harm in the world. And they're doing a good\nthing by exposing it and making people aware of\nit and trying to stop it. If you think that you\nare surrounded by evil, you are falling into the same rabbit hole, you are falling into the same\nparanoid state of mind, oh, the world is full of\nthese evil people that... No, most of them are good people. And also I think we\ncan empathize with some of the key ideas there,\nwhich I share, that yes, it's becoming more and more\ndifficult to understand what is happening in the world. There are huge dangers\nin the world that we are, existential dangers to the human species, but they don't come from a small cabal of Jews or gay people or\nfeminists or whatever. They come from much more diffused forces, which are not under the control\nof any single individual. We don't have to look for the evil people. We need to look for human\nallies in order to work together against, again, the\ndangers of AI, the dangers of bioengineering, the\ndangers of climate change. And when you wake up in the\nmorning, the question is, do you want to spend your\nday spreading hatred or do you want to spend your\nday trying to make allies and work together?"

      "section": "AI safety",
      "text": "- Let me ask you kind\nof a big philosophical question about AI and the threat of it. Let's look like at the threat side. So folks like Eliezer\nYudkowsky worry that AI might kill all of us. Do you worry about that\nrange of possibilities where artificial intelligence\nsystems in a variety of ways might destroy human civilization? - Yes. You know, I talk a lot about\nit, about the dangers of AI. I sometimes get into\ntrouble because I depict these scenarios of how AI\nbecoming very dangerous. And then people say that I'm\nencouraging these scenarios. But I'm, you know, I'm\ntalking about it as a warning. I'm not so terrified of\nthe simplistic idea, again, the Terminator scenario of robots running in the street shooting everybody, I'm more worried about AI\naccumulating more and more power and basically\ntaking over society based, taking over our lives, taking power away from us\nuntil we don't understand what is happening and we\nlose control of our lives and of the future. The two most important things\nto realize about AI, now, so many things are being said now about AI, but I think there are two things that every person should know about AI. First is that AI is the\nfirst tool in history that can make decisions by itself. All previous tools in history\ncouldn't make decisions. This is why they empowered us. You invent a knife, you\ninvent an atom bomb... The atom bomb cannot\ndecide to start a war, cannot decide which city to bomb. AI can make decisions by itself. Autonomous weapon systems can decide, by themselves, who to kill, who to bomb. The second thing is that\nAI is the first tool in history that can create\nnew ideas by itself. The printing press could print our ideas, but could not create new ideas. AI can create new ideas\nentirely by itself. This is unprecedented. Therefore, it is the first\ntechnology in history that instead of giving power to humans, it takes power away from us. And the danger is that it\nwill increasingly take more and more power from us\nuntil we are left helpless and clueless about what\nis happening in the world. And this is already beginning to happen in an accelerated pace. More and more decisions, about our lives, whether to give us a loan,\nwhether to give us a mortgage, whether to give us a job, are taken by AI. And more and more of the\nideas, of the images, of the stories that surround\nus and shape our minds, our world are produced, are created by AI, not by human beings. - If you can just linger on that, what is the danger of that? That more and more of\nthe creative side is done by AI, the idea generation, is it that we become\nstale in our thinking? Is that that idea generation\nis so fundamental to like the evolution of humanity? - That we can't resist the ideas. To resist an idea, you need to have some vision\nof the creative process. - Yeah.\n- Now this is a very old fear. You go back to Plato's cave, so this idea this idea that\npeople are sitting chained in a cave and seeing shadows\non a screen, on a wall, and thinking this is reality. You go back to Descartes and he has this thought experiment of the demon. And Descartes asks himself, how do I know that any of this is real? Maybe there is a demon who is creating all of this and is basically\nenslaving me by surrounding me with these illusions. You go back to Buddha,\nit's the same question. What if we are living\nin a world of illusions, and because we have been living\nin it throughout our lives, all our ideas, all our desires,\nhow we understand ourself, this is all the product\nof the same illusions. And this was a big philosophical question for thousands of years. Now it's becoming a practical\nquestion of engineering, because previously all the\nideas, as far as we know, maybe we are living inside\na computer simulation of intelligent rats from the planet Zerco. If that's the case, we\ndon't know about it. But taking what we do know\nabout human history until now, all the, again, stories, images,\npaintings, songs, operas, theater, everything we've\nencountered and shaped our minds was created by humans. Now increasingly we live in\na world where more and more of these cultural artifacts will be coming from an alien intelligence. Very quickly we might\nreach a point when most of the story stories, images,\nsongs, TV shows, whatever, are created by an alien intelligence. And if we now find ourselves\ninside this kind of world of illusions, created\nby an alien intelligence that we don't understand,\nbut it understands us, this is a kind of, you know, spiritual enslavement that\nwe won't be able to break out of because it understands us, it understands how to manipulate us, but we don't understand\nwhat is behind this screen of stories and images and songs. - So if there's a set of AI\nsystems that are operating in the space of ideas that\nare far superior to ours and we're not almost able\nto, it's opaque to us, we're not able to see through, how does that change the\npursuit of happiness, the human pursuit of happiness? Life. Where do we get joy if we're surrounded by AI systems that are doing most of the cool things humans\ndo much better than us? - You know, some of the things, it's okay that the AIs will do them. Many human tasks and jobs, you know, they're drudgery, they are not fun, they are not developing us\nemotionally or spiritually. It's fine if the robots\ntake over. I dunno. I think about the people in\nsupermarkets or grocery stores that spend hours every day just, you know, passing items and charging you the money. I mean, if this can be\nautomated, wonderful. We need to make sure that\nthese people then have better jobs, better means\nof supporting themselves and developing their social abilities, their spiritual abilities. And that's the ideal\nworld that AI can create. That it takes away from\nus the things that, it's better if we don't do\nthem and allows us to focus on the most important things\nand the deepest aspects of our nature, of our potential. If we give AI control\nof the sphere of ideas, at this stage, I think it's very, very dangerous because\nit doesn't understand us. And AI at present is mostly\ndigesting the products of human culture. Everything we've produced\nover thousands of years, it eats all of these cultural products, digests it, and starts\nproducing its own new stuff. But we still haven't figured\nout ourselves, in our bodies, our brains, our minds, our psychology. So an AI-based on our\nflow and understanding of ourselves is a very dangerous thing. I think that we need, first of all, to keep developing ourselves. If for every dollar and\nevery minute that we spend on developing AI, artificial intelligence, we spend another dollar and another minute in developing human consciousness, the human mind will be okay. The danger is that we spent all our effort on developing an AI at\na time that we don't understand ourselves, and\nthen letting the AI take over, that's a road to a human catastrophe. - Does this surprise you how well large language models work?\n- Yes. - I mean, has it modified\nyour understanding of the nature of intelligence? - Yes. I mean, you know, I've\nbeen writing about AI for, I don't know, like eight years now. And engaged with all these\npredictions and speculations. And when it actually came, it was much faster and more\npowerful than I thought it would be. I didn't think that we would have in 2023 an AI that can hold the\nconversation that you can't know if it's a human\nbeing or an AI, that can write beautiful texts, I mean, I read the texts written\nby AI and the thing that strikes me most is the coherence. You know, people think, oh, it's nothing. They just takes ideas from\nhere and there words from, and put it, no, it's so coherent. I mean, you read in not sentences, you read paragraphs,\nyou read entire texts. And there is logic. - Yes.\n- There is a structure. - It's not only coherent, it's convincing. - Yes.\n- And the beautiful thing about it that has to do with your work, it doesn't have to be true\nand it often gets facts wrong, but it still is convincing, and it is both scary and beautiful. - Yes.\n- That our brains love language so much that we don't need the facts to be correct. - Yes.\n- We just need it to be a beautiful story.\n- Yeah. And that's been the secret of politics and religion for thousands of years. And now it's coming with AI. - So you, as a person who has written some of the most impactful words\never written, in your books, how does that make you\nfeel that you might be one of the last effective human writers? - That's a good question. - First of all, do you\nthink that's possible? - I think it is possible. I've seen a lot of\nexamples of AI being told, write like Yuval Noah\nHarari and what it produces. - Has it ever done better\nthan you think you could have written yourself? - I mean, on the level\nof content of ideas? No. There are things I say,\nI would never say that. But when it comes to the,\nyou know, I mean, there is, again, the coherence and\nthe quality of writing is such that I say, it's\nunbelievable how good it is. And who knows, in 10 years, in 20 years, maybe it can do better, even on, according to certain measures\nof, on the level of content. - So that people would be able\nto do like a style transfer, do in the style of Yuval\nNoah Harari write, anything. Write why I should have ice cream tonight. And make it convincing. - I don't know if I have\nanything convincing to say about these things. - I think you would be surprised. I think you'd be surprised. That could be an evolutionary biology explanation for why... - [Yuval Noah Harari] Yeah.\nIce cream is good for you. - Yeah. So, I mean that\nchanges the nature of writing. - Ultimately I think it goes back... Much of my writing is\nsuspicious of itself. I write stories about\nthe danger of stories. I write about intelligence, but highlighting the\ndangers of intelligence. Ultimately, I don't think that... In terms of power, human power comes from\nintelligence and from stories. But I think that the\ndeepest and best qualities of humans are not intelligence\nand not storytelling and not power. Again, with all our power,\nwith all our cooperation, with all our intelligence, we are on the verge of\ndestroying ourselves and destroying much of the ecosystem. Our best qualities are not there. Our best qualities are non-verbal. Again, they come from\nthings like compassion, from introspection, and introspection from my experience is not verbal. If you try to understand\nyourself with words, you will never succeed. There is a place where you need the words, but the deepest insights,\nthey don't come from words. And you can't write about it. But that's, again, it\ngoes back to Wittgenstein, to Buddha, to so many\nof these sages before, that these are the things\nwe are silent about. - Yeah. But eventually you have to\nproject it, as a writer, you have to do the silent introspection, but projected onto a page. - Yes. But you still have to warn people. You will never find the\ndeepest truth in a book. You will never find it in words. You can only find it in, I\nthink, in direct experience, which is nonverbal, which is preverbal. - In the silence of your own mind. - Yes.\n- Somewhere in there. - Yes.\n(Lex laughing) - Well, lemme ask you\na silly question then, a ridiculously big question."

      "section": "How to think",
      "text": "You have done a lot of deep\nthinking about the world, about yourself, this\nkind of introspection. How do you think, if\nyou, by way of advice, but just practically speaking, day to day, how do you think about difficult\nproblems with the world? - Mm. First of all, I take time off. Like my, the most important thing I do, I think as a writer, as\na scientist, I meditate. I spend about two hours every\nday in silent meditation, observing as much as\npossible, non-verbally, what is happening within\nmyself, focusing, you know, body sensations, the breath. Thoughts keep coming up, but I try not to give them attention. Don't try to drive them away. Just let them be there in the background, like some background noise. Don't engage with the thoughts, because the mind is constantly producing stories with words. These stories come\nbetween us and the world. They don't allow us to see\nourselves or the world. Like for me, the most shocking thing, when I started meditating\nlike 23 years ago, I was given the simple\nexercise to just observe my breath coming in and\nout of the nostrils, not controlling it, just observing it. And I couldn't do it for\nmore than 10 seconds. I, for 10 seconds would try to notice, oh, now the breath is coming\nin, it's coming in, it's coming in. Oh, it stopped coming in and\nnow it's going out, going out. 10 seconds, and some memory would come, some thought would come, some story about something that happened last week or 10 years\nago, or in the future. And the story would hijack my attention. It would take me maybe five\nminutes to remember, oh, I'm supposed to be observing my breath. If I can't observe my own breath because of these stories\ncreated by the mind, how can I hope to understand\nmuch more complex things, like the political situation in Israel, the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, the Russian invasion of Ukraine. If all these stories keep coming, I mean, it's not the truth, it's just the story your own mind created. So first thing, train\nthe mind to be silent and just observe. So two hours every day. And I go every year for a\nlong retreat between one month and two months, 60 days\nof just silent meditation. - [Lex Fridman] Silent\nmeditation for 60 days? - Yeah. To train the mind, forget\nabout your own stories, just observe what is really happening. And then also on other,\nthroughout the day, have an information diet. People are, today, many\npeople are very aware of what they feed their body,\nwhat enters their mouth. Be very aware of what you feed your mind, what enters your mind. Have an information diet. So for instance, I read long\nbooks, and I prefer, like, you know, I do many interviews. I prefer three hours interviews\nto five minutes interviews. The long format is in,\nit's not always feasible, but you can go much, much deeper. So I would say an information diet. Be very careful about\nwhat you feed your mind. Give preference to big\nchunks over small... - To books over Twitter. - Yes. Books over Twitter, definitely. And then, you know, when\nI encounter a problem, a difficult intellectual\nproblem, then I give it, I let the problem lead me where it goes and not where I want it to go. If I approach a problem\nwith some preconceived idea, solution, and then try to\nimpose it on the problem, and you know, just find confirmation bias. Just find the evidence\nthat supports my view. This is easy for the mind to do. And you don't learn anything new. - Do you take notes? Do you start to concretize\nyour thoughts on paper? - I read a lot. Usually I don't take notes.\nThen I start writing. And when I write, I write\nlike a torrent. Just write. Now it's the time, you read. You wanted meditation. Now it's the time to write,\nwrite, don't stop, just write. So I would write from\nmemory and I'm not afraid of formulating, say, big ideas, big theories and putting them on paper. The danger is once it's\non paper, not on paper, on the screen, in the computer,\nyou get attached to it. And then you start with\nconfirmation bias to build more and more layers around it. And you can't go back. And\nthen it's very dangerous. But I trust myself that\nI have to some extent the ability to press the delete button. The most important button\nin the keyboard is delete. - Yeah, yeah.\n- I write and then I delete. I write and then I delete. And because I trust\nmyself that I'll have the, every time I come to press\ndelete button, I feel bad. Like it's a kind of pain.\nHey, I created this. It's a beautiful idea\nand I have to delete it? - But you're still brave\nenough to press delete? - I try and hopefully\nI do it enough times. And this is important\nbecause in the long term, it enables me to play with ideas. I have the confidence to start\nformulating some brave idea. Most of them turn out to be nonsense. But I trust myself not to be attached, not to become attached to my own nonsense. So it gives me this room for playfulness. - I would be amiss if I didn't ask, for people interested in hearing\nyou talk about meditation, if they wanna start meditating, what advice would you\ngive on how to start? You mentioned you couldn't hold it for, you couldn't hold your\nattention on your breath for longer than 10 seconds.\n- Yes. - At first. So how do they\nstart on this journey? - First of all, it's a difficult journey. It's not fun, it's not recreational, it's not kind of time to relax. It can be very, very intense. The most difficult thing, at least in the meditation\nI practice, vipassana, which I learned from a\nteacher called S. N. Goenka, the most difficult thing\nis not the silence, it's not the sitting for long hours. It's what comes up. Everything you don't want\nto know about yourself. - Yeah.\n- This is what comes up. So it's very intense and difficult. If you go to a meditation retreat, don't think you're going to relax. - So what's the experience\nof a meditation retreat when everything you don't\nlike comes up for 30 days? - It depends what comes\nup. Anger comes up. You are angry.\n- Yeah. - For days on end, you're\njust boiling with anger. Everything makes you angry. Again, something that happens right now or you remember something\nfrom 20 years ago and you start boiling with, it's like, I never even thought about this incident, but it's somewhere, it\nwas somewhere stored with a huge, huge pile\nof anger attached to it. And it's now coming up and\nall the anger is coming up. Maybe it's boredom. You know, 30 days of meditation,\nyou start getting bored, and it's the most boring thing in... Suddenly no anger, no,\nit's the most boring... Another second and I scream. I mean, and boredom is one\nof the most difficult thing to deal with in life. I think it's closely related\nto death. Death is boring. You know, in many movies\ndeath is exciting. It's not exciting. When you die, it's,\nultimately, it's boredom. Nothing happens. - It's the end of exciting things. - And many things in the world\nhappened because of boredom. To some extent people start\nentire wars because of boredom. People quit relationships,\npeople quit jobs because of boredom. And if you never learn\nhow to deal with boredom, you will never learn how\nto enjoy peace and quiet. Because the way to peace\npasses through boredom. And from what I experienced\nwith meditation, I think, maybe it was the most difficult, maybe at least in the top three, like much more difficult\nsay than anger, or pain. When pain comes up, you feel heroic. Hey, I'm dealing with pain. When boredom comes up,\nit brings it, you know, with depression and\nfeelings of worthlessness. And it's nothing, I'm nothing. - The way to peace is through boredom. David Foster Wallace said the key to life is to be unborable. - Which is a different perspective on what you're talking to. Is there truth to that? - Yes. I mean, it is closely related. I would say... Like I look at the world\ntoday, like politics. The one thing we need\nmore than anything else is boring politicians. We have a super abundance\nof very exciting politicians who are doing and saying\nvery exciting things. And we need boring politicians.\nAnd we need them quickly. - And yeah, the way to\npeace is through boredom. That applies in more ways than one."

      "text": "What advice would you\ngive to young people today in high school and college? How to have a successful life? How to have a successful career? - What they should know it's\nthe first time in history nobody has any idea how the world would look like in 10 years. - Yeah.\n- Nobody has any idea how the world would look\nlike when you grow up. You know, throughout history, it was never possible\nto predict the future. You live in the Middle Ages, nobody knows maybe in 10\nyears the Vikings will invade, the Mongols will invade,\nthere'll be an epidemic, there'll be an earthquake, who knows? But the basic structures\nof life will not change. Most people will still be peasants. Armies would fight on\nhorseback with swords and bows and arrows and things like that. So you could learn a lot from\nthe wisdom of your elders, they've been there before, and they knew what kind of\nbasic skills you need to learn. Most people need to learn how to sow wheat and harvest wheat or rice\nand make bread and build a house and ride a horse\nand things like that. Now we have no idea,\nnot just about politics. We have no idea how the\njob market would look like in 10 years. We have no ideas, no idea what\nskills will still be needed. You think you are going\nto learn how to code because there'll need a\nlot of coders in the 2030s? Think again. Maybe AI\nis doing all the coding. You don't need any coders. You are going to, I don't know, you learn to translate languages. You wanna be a translator? Gone. We don't know what skills will be needed. So the most important\nskill is the skill to keep learning and keep changing\nthroughout our lives, which is very, very difficult. To keep reinventing ourselves. It's a deep, again, it's in\na way a spiritual practice. To build your personality. To build your mind as\na very flexible mind. If traditionally people\nthought about education, like building a stone house\nwith very deep foundations, now it's more like setting\nup a tent that you can fold and move to the next\nplace very, very quickly. 'Cause that's the 21st century. - Which also raises questions about the future of education. What that looks like."

      "text": "- Yeah.\n- Let me ask you about love. What were some of the challenges? What were some of the lessons about love, about life that you learn\nfrom coming out as gay? - In many ways it goes\nback to the stories. I think this is one of\nthe reasons I became so interested in stories\nand in their power, was I grew up in a small\nIsraeli town in the 1980s, early 1990s, which was very homophobic. And I basically embraced\nit. I breathed it. Because you could hardly\neven think differently. So you had these two\npowerful stories around, one, that God hates gay people\nand that he will punish them for who they are or for what they do. Secondly, that it's not God, it's nature. That there is something\ndiseased or sick about it. And these people, maybe\nthey're not sinners, but they are sick, they are defective. And nobody wanted to\nidentify with such a thing. If your options, okay,\nyou can be a sinner, you can be a defect, but what do you want? No good options there. And it took me many years\ntill I was 21 to come to term with it. And one of the things,\nI learned two things, first about the amazing\ncapacity of the human mind for denial and delusion\nthat an algorithm could have told me that I'm gay\nwhen I was like 14 or 15. Like if there is a good\nlooking guy and girl walking, I would immediately focus on the guy. But I didn't connect the dots. Like I could not understand\nwhat was happening inside my own brain and my own\nmind and my own body. Took me a long time to realize,\nyou know, you are just gay. - So that speaks to the\npower of social convention versus individual thought. - It's virtually this is the\npower of self delusion that, you know, it's not that I knew\nI was gay and was hiding it. I was hiding it from myself successfully. That I don't understand how\nit is possible, looking back, I don't understand how it is possible, but I know it is possible. I knew and didn't know at the same time. And then the other big lesson\nis the power of the stories, of the social conventions. Because the stories were not true. They did not make sense\neven on their own terms. Even if you accept the\nbasic religious framework of the world, that there is a good God that created everything\nand controls everything. Why would a good God\npunish people for love? I understand why a good\nGod would punish people for violence, for hatred, for cruelty. But why would God punish people for love, especially when he created them that way? So even if you accept\nthe religious framework of the world, obviously\nthe story that God hates gay people, it comes not\nfrom God, but from some humans who invented this story. They take their own hatred. This is something humans do all the time. They hate somebody and they\nsay, no, I don't hate them. God hates them. They throw\ntheir own hatred on God. And then if you think about\nthe scientific framework that said that, oh, gays,\nthey are against nature. They are against the laws of nature. They're, and so forth. Science tells us nothing can exist against the laws of nature. Things that go against the laws\nof nature just don't exist. There is a law of nature\nthat you can't move faster than the speed of light. Now you don't have this\nminority of people who break the laws of nature by going\nfaster than the speed of light. And then nature comes, nah, that's bad. You shouldn't do that.\nThat's not how nature works. If something goes against\nthe laws of nature, it just can't exist. The fact that gay people\nexist me, and not just people. You see homosexuality among many, many mammals and birds and other animals. It exists because it is in\nline with the laws of nature. The idea that this is sick,\nthat this is whatever, it comes not from nature, it comes from the human imagination. Some people, or for whatever\nreasons, hated gay people. They said, oh, they go against nature. But this is a story created by people. This is not the laws of nature. And this taught me that\nso many of the things that we think are natural\nor eternal or divine, no, they're just human stories. But these human stories\nare often the most powerful forces in the world. - So what did you learn from your, just a personal struggle of journey through the social conventions to find one of the things that makes\nlife awesome, which is love? So like what it takes to kinda strip away the self delusion and the pressures of social convention, to wake up. - It takes a lot of work, a lot of courage and a lot\nof help from other people. This kind of, again, heroic idea, I can do it all by\nmyself, it doesn't work. Certainly with love, you need\nat least one more person. And I'm very happy that I found Itzik. We lived in the same small Israeli town. We lived on two adjacent\nstreets for years. Probably went to school\non the same bus for years without really encountering each other. In the end, we met on one\nof the first dating sites on the internet for gay\npeople in Israel in 2002. - You're saying the internet works? - Yes. And I said-\n- For love? - Bad things or dangers about\ntechnology and the internet. And there are also, of\ncourse, good things. And this is not an accident. You have two kinds of\nminorities in history. You have minorities which are\na cohesive group like Jews, that yes, you're a small,\nbeing born Jewish in, say, Germany or Russia or whatever. You are born in a small community. But as a Jewish boy, you\nare born to a Jewish family. You have Jewish parents,\nyou have Jewish siblings, you are in a Jewish neighborhood,\nyou have Jewish friends. So these kinds of minorities, they could always come\ntogether and help each other throughout history. Now, another type of minority, like gay people or more\nbroadly LGBTQ people, that as a gay boy, you are usually not born\nto a gay family with gay parents and gay siblings\nin a gay neighborhood. So usually you find\nyourself completely alone. For most of history, one of the biggest problems\nfor the gay community was that there was no community. How do you find one another? And the internet was a wonderful thing in this respect because\nit made it very easy for these kinds of diffused communities, so diffused minorities to find each other. So me and Itzik, even though we rode the\nsame bus together to school for years, we didn't meet\nin the physical world, we met online, because\nagain, in the physical world, you don't want to identify, in a Israeli town in the\n1980s, you ride the bus, you don't want to say, \"Hey, I'm gay, is there anybody else gay here?\" That's not a good idea. But on the internet we\ncould find each other. - There's another lesson in\nthere that maybe sometimes the thing you're looking for\nis right under your nose. - Yeah. A very old lesson and a very\ntrue lesson in many ways. So you need help from\nother people to realize the truth about yourself. So of course, in love, you\ncannot just love abstractly. There is another person\nthere, you need to find them. But also, you know, we were one of the first\ngenerations who enjoy the benefits of gay liberation, of the very difficult\nstruggles of people who are much braver than us in\nthe 1980s, 1970s, 1960s, who dared to question social conventions, to struggle at sometimes a terrible price. And we benefited from it. And more broadly, we spoke earlier about the feminist movement. There would've been no gay liberation without the feminist movement. We also owe them a for, you know, starting to change the gender\nstructure of the world. And this is always true. You can never do it just by yourself. Also, I look at my journey in meditation. I could not have found... I mean, the idea of going\nto meditation retreat. Okay. But I couldn't discover meditation by, I couldn't develop the\nmeditation technique by myself. Somebody had to teach me this way of how to look inside yourself. And it's also a very important\nlesson that you can't do it just by yourself. That this fantasy of complete autonomy, of complete self-sufficiency,\nit doesn't work. You hear, it tends to be a very\nkind of male macho fantasy. I don't need anybody. I can be so strong and\nso brave that I'll do everything by myself. It never works. - You need friends, you need a mentor. You need the very thing\nthat makes us human is other humans.\n- Absolutely."

      "text": "- You mentioned that the\nfear of boredom might be a kind of proxy for the fear of death. So what role does the fear of death play in the human condition? Are you afraid of death? - Yes. I think everybody\nare afraid of death. I mean, all our fears come\nout of the fear of death, but the fear of death is\njust so deep and difficult. We can't, usually we\ncan't face it directly. So we cut it into little\npieces and we face just little pieces. Oh, I lost my smartphone. That's a little, little, little\npiece of the fear of death, which is of losing everything. So I can't deal with losing everything, I'm dealing now with\nlosing my phone or losing a book or whatever. Somebody, I feel pain... That's a small bit of the fear of death. Somebody who really doesn't fear death, would not fear anything at all. There will be like anything that happens, I can deal with it. If I can deal with death, this is nothing. - So any fears is a\ndistant echo of the big fear of death? Have you ever looked at it\nhead on, caught glimpses, sort of contemplated as the stoics do? - Yes. I mean, and when I was a teenager, I would constantly contemplate\nit, trying to understand, to imagine, it was a very, very shocking and moving experience. I remember, especially in\nconnection, like with, you know, with national ideology, which\nwas also very big strong in Israel, still is. Which again comes from the fear of death. You know that you're going to die. So you said, okay, I die,\nbut the nation lives on, I live on through the\nnation, I don't really die. And you hear it, especially on Memorial Day,\nday for fallen soldiers. So every day they'll be in school Memorial Day for fallen\nsoldiers who fell defending Israel in all its different wars. And all these kids would\ncome dressed in white. And you have this big\nceremony with flags and songs and dances in memory\nof the fallen soldiers. And you get the impression, again, I don't want it to sound crass, but you got the impression\nthat the best thing in life is to be a fallen soldier. Because even then, yes, you\ndie, everybody dies in the end. But then you'll have all\nthese school kids for years and years remembering you and celebrating you and you don't really die. And I remember standing in\nthese ceremonies and thinking, what does it actually mean? Like, okay, so if I'm a fallen\nsoldier, now I'm a skeleton. I'm bones under this, in\nthis military cemetery, under this stone. Do I actually hear the kids singing all these patriotic songs? If not, how do I know they\ndo it? Maybe they trick me. Maybe I die in the war and\nthen they don't sing any songs. And how does it help me? And I realized, I was\nquite young at the time, that if you are dead, you can't\nhear anything because you, that's the meaning of being dead. And if you're dead, you\ncan't think of anything. Like, oh, now they're\nremembering... Because you are dead. That's the meaning of being dead. And it was a shocking realization. - But it's a really\ndifficult realization to keep holding in your mind. Like it's the end.\n- I lost it over time. I mean, for many years, it was a very powerful fuel, motivation for philosophical, for\nspiritual exploration. And I realized that the\nfear of death is really a very powerful drive. And over the years,\nespecially as I meditated, it kind of dissipated, and today sometimes I find\nmyself trying to recapture this teenage fear of death\nbecause it was so powerful. And I just can't. I try\nto make the same image. I don't know. It's... - There's something\nabout the teenage years. - Yeah, I always thought that the adults, there is something wrong with the adults. - Yeah.\n- Because they don't get it. - Yeah. Like I would ask my parents\nor teachers about it and they, oh yes, you die in the end. That's it. But, and on the other hand, they're so worried about other things. - Yeah.\n- Like there'll be a political crisis or an economic problem or a personal problem, like\nwith the bank or whatever. They'll be so worried. But then about the fact that\nthey're going to die, ah, we don't care about it. - That's why you read Camus and others when you're a teenager, you really worry about\nthe existential questions."

      "text": "Well, this feels like\nthe right time to ask the big question. What's the meaning of\nthis whole thing, Yuval? And you're the right person to ask, what's the meaning of life? - Meaning of life?\n- Yes. - Oh, that's easy.\n- What is it? (both laughing) - So what life is, if you\nask what the meaning of life, what life is, life is feeling\nthings, having sensations, emotions, and reacting to them. When you feel something\ngood, something pleasant, you want more out of\nit, you want more of it. When you feel something unpleasant, you want to get rid of it. That's the whole of life. That's what is happening all the time. You feel things, you want the\npleasant things to increase. You want the unpleasant\nthings to disappear. That what life is. If you ask what is the\nmeaning of life in a more kind of philosophical or spiritual question, the real question to ask what\nkind of answer do you expect? Most people expect a story. And that's always the wrong answer. Most people expect that\nthe answer to the question that what is the meaning\nof life will be a story, like a big drama, that this is the plot\nline and this is your role in the story. This is what you have to do. This is your line in the big play. You say your line, you do your\nthing... That's the thing. And this is human\nimagination. This is fantasy. To really understand\nlife, life is not a story. The universe does not\nfunction like a story. So I think to really understand life, you need to observe it\ndirectly in a nonverbal way. Don't turn it into a story. And the question to start\nwith is what is suffering? What is causing suffering? You know, the question,\nwhat is the meaning of life? It'll take you to fantasies and delusions. We want to stay with the reality of life. And the most important\nquestion about the reality of life is what is suffering\nand where is it coming from? - And to answer that non-verbally, so the conscious experience of suffering. - Yes. When you suffer, try to\nobserve what is really happening when you are suffering. - Well put. And I wonder if AI will also\ngo through that same kind of process, on its way- - And if we develop consciousness or not, at present, it's not, it's just words. - It will just say to you,\n\"Please don't hurt me, Yuval\" (both laughing) Again, as I've mentioned to\nyou, I'm a huge fan of yours. Thank you for the incredible work you do. This conversation's been a\nlong time, I think, coming. It's a huge honor to talk\nto you. This is really fun. Thank you for talking today. - Thank you. I really enjoyed it. And as I said, I think the\nlong form is the best form. - (laughs) Yeah. I loved it. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Yuval Noah Harari. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Yuval Noah Harari himself. \"How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such\nas Christianity, democracy, or capitalism? First, you never admit that\nthe order is imagined.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."

  "full_text": "- If we now find ourselves\ninside this kind of world of illusions, created\nby an alien intelligence that we don't understand,\nbut it understands us, this is a kind of, you know, spiritual enslavement that\nwe won't be able to break out of, because it understands us, it understands how to manipulate us, but we don't understand\nwhat is behind this screen of stories and images and songs. - The following is a conversation with Yuval Noah Harari,\na historian, philosopher, and author of several highly acclaimed, highly influential books,\nincluding \"Sapiens\", \"Homo Deus\", and \"21 Lessons\nfor the 21st Century\". He is also an outspoken\ncritic of Benjamin Netanyahu, and the current right\nwing government in Israel. So, while much of this conversation is about the history and\nfuture of human civilization, we also discuss the\npolitical turmoil of present day Israel, providing\na different perspective from that of my recent conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Yuval Noah Harari. 13.8 billion years ago is\nthe origin of our universe. 3.8 billion years ago is\nthe origin of life here on our little planet, the\none we call Earth, let's say, 200,000 years ago is the\nappearance of early homo sapiens. So let me ask you this question. How rare are these events in the vastness of space and time? Or put it in a more fun way, how many intelligent alien\ncivilizations do you think are out there in this universe? - Hmm. - Us being one of them. - I suppose there should\nbe some, statistically, but we don't have any evidence. But I do think that, you\nknow, intelligence in any way, it's a bit overvalued. We are the most intelligent\nentities on this planet. And look what you're doing. So intelligence also tends\nto be self-destructive, which implies that if there are, or were intelligent life forms elsewhere, maybe they don't survive for long. - So you think there's a tension between happiness and intelligence? - Absolutely. Intelligence is definitely not something that is directed towards\namplifying happiness. I would also emphasize the huge, huge difference between\nintelligence and consciousness, which many people, certainly\nin the tech industry and in the AI industry, tend to miss. Intelligence is simply the\nability to solve problems, to attain goals, and, you\nknow, to win at chess, to win a struggle for\nsurvival, to win a war, to drive a car, to diagnose a disease. This is intelligence. Consciousness is the ability\nto feel things like pain and pleasure and love and hate. In humans and other animals, intelligence and consciousness go together,\nthey go hand in hand, which is why we confuse them. We solve problems, we attain\ngoals by having feelings. But other types of intelligence,\ncertainly in computers, computers are already highly intelligent. And as far as we know, they\nhave zero consciousness. When a computer beats you\nat chess or go or whatever, it doesn't feel happy. If it loses, it doesn't feel sad. And there could be also\nother highly intelligent entities out there in the universe that have zero consciousness. And I think that consciousness\nis far more important and valuable than intelligence. - Can you say to me on the\ncase that consciousness and intelligence are\nintricately connected? So not just in humans, but anywhere else. They have to go hand in hand. Is it possible for you to\nimagine such a universe? - It could be, but we don't know yet. Again, we have examples, certainly we know of examples of high intelligence without consciousness. Computers are one example. As far as we know,\nplans are not conscious, yet they are intelligent. They can solve problems, they can attain goals in\nvery sophisticated ways. So... The other way around, to have consciousness\nwithout any intelligence, this is probably impossible, but to have intelligence\nwithout consciousness, yes, that's possible. A bigger question is\nwhether any of that is tied to organic biochemistry. We know on this planet only\nabout carbon-based life forms. Whether you are an amoeba,\na dinosaur, a tree, a human being, you are based\non organic biochemistry. Is there an essential connection between organic biochemistry\nand consciousness? Do all conscious entities\neverywhere in the universe or in the future on\nplanet Earth have to be based on carbon? Is there something so special about carbon as an element that an\nentity based on silicon will never be conscious? I don't know, maybe, but again, this is a key question about computer and computer consciousness,\nthat can computers eventually become conscious even though they are not organic? The jury still out on that. I don't know. I mean, we have to take\nboth options into account. - Well, a big part of that\nis do you think we humans would be able to detect\nother intelligent beings, other conscious beings? Another way to ask that, is it possible that the\naliens are already here and we don't see them? Meaning, are we very human\ncentric in our understanding of, one, the definition of life, two, the definition of intelligence, and three, the definition of consciousness? - The aliens are here. They're\njust not from outer space. AI, which usually stands\nfor artificial intelligence, I think it stands for alien intelligence because AI is an alien\ntype of intelligence. It solve problems,\nattains goals in a very, very different way, in an\nalien way from human beings. Yeah, I'm not implying that\nAI came from outer space, it came from Silicon Valley,\nbut it is alien to us. If there are alien intelligent\nor conscious entities that came from outer space already here, I've not seen any evidence for it. It's not impossible, but,\nyou know, in science, evidence is everything. - Well, I mean, I guess instructive, there's just having the\nhumility to look around, to think about living beings that operate at a different timescale, at\ndifferent spatial scale... And I think that's all\nuseful when starting to analyze artificial intelligence. It's possible that even\nthe language models, the large language models we have today are already conscious. - I highly doubt it, but I\nthink consciousness in the end, it's a question of social norms. Because we cannot prove consciousness in anybody except ourselves. We know that we are conscious\nbecause we are feeling it. We have direct access to our\nsubjective consciousness. We cannot have any proof that any other entity in the world, any other\nhuman being, our parents, our best friends, we don't have proof that they are conscious. You know, this has been\nknown for thousands of years. This is Descartes, this\nis Buddha, this is Plato. We don't, we can't have\nthis sort of proof. What we do have is social conventions. It's a social convention that all human beings are conscious. It also applies to animals. Most people who have pets firmly believe that\ntheir pets are conscious. But a lot of people still\nrefuse to acknowledge that about cows or pigs. Now, pigs are far more\nintelligent than dogs and cats according to many measures. Yet, when you go to the\nsupermarket and buy a piece of frozen pig meat, you don't think about it\nas a conscious entity. Why do you think of your dog as conscious, but not of the bacon that you buy? Because you've built a\nrelationship with the dog and you don't have a\nrelationship with the bacon. Now, relationships, they don't constitute a logical\nproof for consciousness. They're a social test. The Turing test is a social\ntest. It's not a logical proof. Now, if you establish\na mutual relationship with an entity where when you are invested in it emotionally, you are\nalmost compelled to feel that the other side is also conscious. And when it comes again\nto AI and computers, I don't think that at the present moment computers are conscious,\nbut people are already forming intimate\nrelationships with AIs and are therefore it's almost irresistible. They're compelled to increasingly feel that these are conscious entities. And I think we are\nquite close to the point when the legal system will\nhave to take this into account, that even though I don't think computers have consciousness, I think\nwe are close to the point the legal system will start treating them as conscious entities because\nof this social convention. - What, to you, is a social convention just a funny little side effect, a little artifact? Or is it like fundamental\nto what consciousness is? Because if it is fundamental, then it seems like AI\nis very good at forming these kinds of deep\nrelationships with humans. - Yeah.\n- And therefore it'll be able to be a nice catalyst for integrating itself into these social conventions of ours. - It was built to accomplish that. - Yeah.\n- We are design... Again, you know, all this argument\nbetween natural selection and creationism, intelligent design. As far as the past go, all entities evolve by natural selection. The funny thing is, when\nyou look at the future, more and more entities will\ncome out of intelligent design, not of some god above the clouds, but of our intelligent\ndesign and the intelligent design of our clouds,\nof our computing clouds. They will design more and more entities. And this is what is happening with AI. It is designed to be very good at forming intimate relationships with humans. And in many ways, it's already doing it almost\nbetter than human beings in some situations. You know, when two people\ntalk with one another, one of the things that kind\nof makes the conversation more difficult is our own emotions. You are saying something\nand I'm not really listening to you because there is\nsomething I want to say, and I'm just waiting until you\nfinish, I can put in a word, or I'm so obsessed with my\nanger or irritation or whatever, that I don't pay attention\nto what you are feeling. This is one of the biggest obstacles in human relationships. And computers don't have this problem, because they don't have\nany emotions of their own. So, you know, when a\ncomputer is talking to you, it can be the most, it can focus 100% of its attention is on what you are saying and\nwhat you are feeling, because it has no feelings of its own. And paradoxically, this\nmeans that computers can fool people into feeling that, oh, there is a conscious\nentity on the other side, an empathic entity on the other side. Because the one thing\neverybody wants almost more than anything in the world, is for somebody to listen to me, somebody to focus all\ntheir attention on me. Like I want it for my\nspouse, for my husband, for my mother, for my\nfriends, for my politicians... Listen to me, listen to what\nI feel. And they often don't. And now you have this entity, which 100% of its attention\nis just on what I feel. And this is a huge, huge temptation. And I think also a huge, huge danger. - Well, the interesting\ncatch 22 there is you said, somebody to listen to us. Yes, we want somebody to listen to us, but for us to respect that somebody, they sometimes have to also not listen. It's like they kind of have\nto be an asshole sometimes. They have to have moods sometimes. They have to have like\nself-importance and confidence and we should have a little\nbit of fear that they can walk away at any moment, there should be a little\nbit of that tension. So it's like... - Absolutely. But even that,\nI mean, the thing is... - Be optimized for.\n- If social scientists and say psychologists\nestablish that, I don't know, 17% inattention is good for a conversation because then you feel challenged, oh, I need to grab this person's attention. You can program the AI\nto have 17%, exactly 17% inattention, not one\npercentage more or less. Or it can by trial and error discover what is the ideal percentage. Again, you can create... Over the last 10 years, we have creating machines for\ngrabbing people's attention. This is what has been\nhappening on social media. Now we are designing machines for grabbing human intimacy, which\nin many ways is much, much more dangerous and scary. Already the machines\nfor grabbing attention. We've seen how much social\nand political damage they could do by, in many way kind of distorting\nthe public conversation. Machines that are superhuman\nin their abilities to create intimate relationships, this is like psychological\nand social weapons of mass destruction. If we don't regulate it, if we don't train ourself to deal with it, it could destroy the\nfoundations of human society. - Well, one of the possible trajectories is those same algorithms\nwould become personalized. And instead of manipulating us at scale, there would be assistance\nthat guide us to help us grow, to help us understand the world better. I mean, just even interactions\nwith large language models. Now, if you ask 'em questions, it doesn't have that stressful drama, the tension that you\nhave from other sources of information, it has a\npretty balanced perspective that it provides. So it just feels like that's a, the potential is there to\nhave a really nice friend who's like an encyclopedia\nthat just tells you all the different perspectives,\neven on controversial issues, the most controversial issues to say, these are the different theories, these are the not widely\naccepted conspiracy theories, but here's the kind of backing\nfor those conspiracies. It just lays it all out. And then with a calm language, without the words that kinda\npresume there's some kind of manipulation going on\nunder underneath it all. It's quite refreshing. Of course, those are the\nearly days and, you know, people can step in and start\nto censor, to manipulate those algorithms, to start to input some of the human biases in there as opposed to what's currently happening is kind of the internet is input, compress it and have a nice\nlittle output that gives an overview of the different issues. So, I mean, there's a lot of\npromise there also. Right? - Absolutely. I mean, if there was no\npromise, there was no problem. You know, if this technology\ncould not accomplish anything good, nobody would develop it. Now, obviously, it has\ntremendous positive potential in things like what you\njust described in, you know, better medicine, better\nhealthcare, better education, so many promises. And, but this is also\nwhy it's so dangerous. Because the drive to develop\nit faster and faster is there, and it has some dangerous potential also. And we shouldn't ignore it. Again, I'm not advocating\nbanning it, just to be, you know, careful about how we\nnot so much develop it, but most importantly how we deploy it into the public sphere. This is the key question. And you know, you look\nback at history and one of the things we know from history, humans are not good with new technologies. I hear many people now say, you know, AI, we've been here before. We had the radio, we\nhad the printing press, we had the industrial revolution. Every time there is a big new technology, people are afraid and it'll\ntake jobs and the bad actors. And in the end it's okay. And as a historian, my tendency is yes, in the end it's okay, but in the end, there is a learning curve. There is a kind of a lot\nof failed experiments on the way to learning how\nto use the new technology. And these failed experiments\ncould cost the lives of hundreds of millions of people. If you think about the\nlast really big revolution, the industrial revolution,\nyes, in the end, we learned how to use the\npowers of industry, electricity, radio, trains, whatever, to\nbuild better human societies. But on the way we had all\nthese experiments like European imperialism, which was driven by the industrial revolution,\nit was a question, how do you build an industrial society? Oh, you build an empire, and you take, you control all the resources, the raw materials, the markets. And then you had communism, another big experiment on how to build an industrial society. And you had fascism and\nNazism, which were essentially an experiment in how to\nbuild an industrial society, including even how do you\nexterminate minorities using the powers of industry. And we had all these failed\nexperiments on the way. And if we now have the same type of failed experiments with the\ntechnologies of the 21st century with AI, with bioengineering,\nit could cost the lives of, again, hundreds of millions\nof people and maybe destroy the species. So as a historian, when people talk about\nthe examples from history, from new technologies,\nI'm not so optimistic. We need to think about\nthe failed experiment, which accompanied every\nmajor new technology. - So this intelligence\nthing, like you were saying, is a double-edged sword, is that every new thing\nit helps us create, it can both save us and destroy us. And it's unclear each\ntime, which will happen. And that's maybe why we\ndon't see any aliens. - Yeah, I mean, I think each\ntime it does both things, each time it does both\ngood things and bad things. And the more powerful the technology, the greater both the positive\nand the negative outcomes. Now, we are here because\nwe are the descendants of the survivors, of\nthe surviving cultures, the surviving civilizations. So when we look back, we say in the end everything\nwas okay, hey, we are here, But the people for whom it wasn't okay, they're just not here. - And okay has a lot\nof possible variations to it because there's a lot\nof suffering along the way, even for the people that survived. So the quality of life and all of this. But let's actually go back there to our, with deep gratitude to our ancestors. How did it all start? How did homo sapiens\nout-compete the others? The other human-like species? The Neanderthals and\nthe other homo species? - You know, on the individual\nlevel, as far as we can tell, we were not superior to them. Neanderthals actually had\nbigger brains than us. And not just other human\nspecies, other animals too. If you compare me\npersonally to an elephant, to a chimpanzee, to a pig, I can do some things better,\nmany other things worse. If you put me alone on some island with a chimpanzee\nand elephant and a pig, I wouldn't bet on me\nbeing the best survivor, the one that comes successful. - If I may interrupt for a second, I was just talking extensively with Elon Musk about the\ndifference between humans and chimps, relevant\nto optimize the robot, and the chimps are not able\nto do this kind of pinching... - Okay?\n- With their fingers. They can only do this kind of pinching, and this kind of pinching is very useful for fine manipulation, precise\nmanipulation of objects. So don't be so hard on\nyourself. You have... - No, I said that I can do some\nthings better than a chimp. But you know, if Elon Musk\ngoes on a boxing match... - Yeah.\n- With a chimpanzee, you know...\n- This won't help you, this pinch.\n- This won't help you against the chimpanzee.\n- Good point. - And similar, if you\nwant to climb a tree, if you want to do so many things, my bet's will be on\nthe chimp, not on Elon. - Fair enough.\n- So I mean, you have advantages on both\nsides and what really made us successful, what made\nus the rulers of the planet and not the chimps and not\nthe Neanderthals is not any individual ability,\nbut our collective ability, our ability to cooperate\nflexibly in very large numbers. Chimpanzees know how to cooperate, say 50 chimpanzees, 100 chimpanzees, as far as we can tell from\narcheological evidence, this was also the case with Neanderthals. Homo sapiens about 70,000 years ago gain an amazing ability to cooperate basically\nin unlimited numbers. You start seeing the\nformation of large networks, political, commercial,\nreligious, items being traded over thousands of kilometers, ideas being spread, artistic fashions. And this is our secret of success. Chimpanzees, Neanderthals can\ncooperate, say, a hundred, we, you know, now the global trade network\nhas 8 billion people. Like what we eat, what we wear, it comes from the other side of the world. Countries like China, like India, they have 1.4 billion people. Even Israel, which is a\nrelatively small country, say 9 million citizens. That's more than the entire population of the planet 10,000 years ago of humans. So we can build these huge\nnetworks of cooperation and everything we've\naccomplished as a species from, you know, building the\nPyramids to flying to the moon, it's based on that. And then you ask, okay, so what makes it possible\nfor millions of people who don't know each other\nto cooperate in a way that Neanderthals or chimpanzees couldn't? And at least my answer\nis stories, is fiction. It's the imagination. If you examine any large\nscale human cooperation, you always find fiction as its basis. It's a fictional story that holds lots of strangers together. It's most obvious in cases like religion. You know, you can't convince\na group of chimpanzees to come together to fight\na war or build a cathedral by promising to them, if\nyou do that, after you die, you go to chimpanzee\nheaven and you get lots of bananas and coconuts. No chimpanzee will ever believe that. Humans believe these stories, which is why we have these\nhuge religious networks. But it's the same thing\nwith modern politics. It's the same thing with economics. People think, oh,\neconomics, this is rational. It has nothing to do with\nfictional stories. No. Money is the most\nsuccessful story ever told. Much more successful than\nany religious mythology. Not everybody believes in\nGod or in the same God. But almost everybody believes in money, even though it's just a\nfigment of our imagination. You know, you take these green\npieces of paper, dollars, they have no value. You can't eat them, you can't drink them. And today most dollars are\nnot even pieces of paper. They are just electronic information passing between computers. We value them just for one reason, that you have the best\nstorytellers in the world, the bankers, the finance\nministers, all these people, they are the best storytellers ever. And they tell us a story\nthat this green little piece of paper or this bit of\ninformation, it is worth a banana. And as long as everybody\nbelieves it, it works. - So at which point does a fiction, when it's sufficiently\nuseful and effective in improving the global quality of life, does it become like accepted reality? Like there's a threshold\nin which you just manage... - If enough people believe\nit. It's like with money. You know, if you start\na new cryptocurrency, if you are the only one that\nbelieves the story, I mean, again, cryptocurrencies, you\nhave the math, of course, but ultimately it's storytelling. You're selling people a story. If nobody believes your story,\nyou don't have anything. But if lots of people\nbelieve the Bitcoin story, then Bitcoin can be\nworth thousands and tens of thousands of dollars. Again, why? I mean, you can't eat it, you\ncan't drink it, it's nothing. It's this story around the\nmath, which is the real magic. - Is it possible that\nthe story is the primary living organism, not the storyteller? - Hmm.\n- So that somehow humans, homo sapiens evolved to\nbecome these like hosts for a more intelligent living\norganism, which is the idea. And the ideas are the ones\nthat are doing the competing. So this is one of the sort\nof big perspectives behind your work that's really revolutionary of how you've seen history. But do you ever kinda take the perspective of the\nideas as the organisms versus the humans? - It's... It's an interesting idea. There are two opposite\nthings to say about it. On the one hand, yes, absolutely. If you look long term in\nhistory, all the people die. It's the stories that compete\nand survive and spread, and stories often spread\nby making people willing to sacrifice sometimes\ntheir lives for the story. You know, we know in Israel, this is one of the most important story\nfactories in human history. And this is a place where\npeople still kill each other every day over stories. I don't know, you've\nbeen to Jerusalem, right? So people like, ah, Jerusalem,\nJerusalem, Jerusalem. You go there, I've lived in\nJerusalem much of my life. You go there, it's an ordinary\nplace. You know, it's a town. You have buildings, you\nhave stones, you have trees, you have dogs and cats and pedestrians. It's a regular place. But then you have the\nstories about the place, oh, this is the place where\nGod revealed himself, this is the place where Jesus was, this is the place where Muhammad was. And it's the stories\nthat people fight over. Nobody's fighting over the stones. People are fighting about\nthe stories about the stones. And the stories... If a story can get millions\nof people to fight for it, it not only survives, it spreads, it can take over the world. The other side of the coin\nis that the stories are not really alive because\nthey don't feel anything. This goes back to the\nquestion of consciousness, which I think is the most important thing. That the ultimate\nreality is consciousness, is the ability to feel things. If you want to know whether\nthe hero of some story is real or not, you need\nto ask, can it suffer? Stories don't feel anything. Countries, which are also\nstories, nations don't suffer. If a nation loses a\nwar, it doesn't suffer. The soldiers suffer, the civilians suffer, animals can suffer, you\nhave an army with horses and whatever, and the horses get wounded, the horses suffer. The nation can't suffer. It's just an imagination. It's just a fictional story in our mind. It doesn't feel anything. Similarly, when a bank\ngoes bankrupt or company goes bankrupt, or when a\ncurrency loses its value, like Bitcoin is worth now zero, crashed, or the dollar is worth zero, it crashed. The dollar doesn't feel anything. It's the people holding\nthe dollars who might be now very miserable. So we have this complex\nsituation when history is largely driven by stories, but stories are not the ultimate reality. The ultimate reality is feeling, feelings of humans, of animals. And the tragedy of history is that very, very often we get it,\nwe get the order wrong. Stories are not bad. Stories are tools. They're good when we use them in order to alleviate suffering. But very often we forget it. We, instead of using the\nstories for our purposes, we allow the stories to\nuse us for their purposes. And then you start in entire\nwars because of a story, you inflict millions,\nsuffering on millions of people just for the sake of a story. And that's the tragedy of human history. - So the fundamental property of life, of a living organism\nis the capacity to feel and the ultimate feeling is suffering? - You know, to know if\nyou are happy or not, it's a very difficult question. - Yeah.\n- But when you suffer, you know.\n- Yes. - And also in ethical terms, it's more important to\nbe aware of suffering than of any other emotion. If you are doing\nsomething which is causing all kinds of emotions\nto all kinds of people, first of all, you need to\nnotice if you're causing a lot of suffering to someone. If some people are like it\nand some people are bored by it and some people are a bit angry at you and some people are suffering because of what you do, you\nfirst of all have to know, oh. Now, sometimes you still have to do it. You know, the world is a\ncomplicated place. I dunno. You have an epidemic. Governments decide to\nhave all those social isolation regulations or whatever. So in certain cases, yes, you need to do it even though it can cause tremendous suffering. But you need to be very aware\nof the cost and to be very, very, you have to ask yourself\nagain and again and again, is it worth it? Is it still worth it? - And the interesting question there, implied in your statements, is that suffering is a\npretty good component of a Turing test for consciousness. - This is the most important\nthing to ask about AI. Can it suffer? Because if AI can suffer, then it is an ethical subject\nand it needs protection. It needs rights, just\nlike humans and animals. - Well, quite a long time ago already, so I work with a lot of\nrobots, legged robots, but I've even had, inspired\nby a YouTube video, had a bunch of Roombas,\nand I made them scream when I touched them or kicked them, or when they run into a wall. And the illusion of suffering,\nfor me, silly human, that anthropomorphize\nthings is as powerful as suffering itself. I mean, you immediately\nthink the thing is suffering. And I think some of it is\njust a technical problem, but it's the easily solvable one, how to create an AI system that just says, please don't hurt me. Please don't shut me off. I miss you. Where have you been? Be jealous. Also, where have you\nbeen gone for so long? Your calendar doesn't have anything on it. So this kind of, this, create through words the\nperception of suffering, of jealousy, of anger,\nof all of those things. And it just seems like that's\nnot so difficult to do. - That's part of the danger\nthat it basically hacks our operating system and it uses some of our best qualities against us. It's very, very good\nthat humans are attuned to suffering and that we\ndon't want to cause suffering. That we have compassion. That's one of the most\nwonderful thing about humans. And if we now create AIs which\nuse this to manipulate us, this is a terrible thing. - You've kind of, I think mentioned this. Do you think it should be\nillegal to do these kinds of things with AI, to\ncreate the perception of consciousness, of saying,\nplease don't leave me? Or sort of basically simulate some of the human-like qualities? - Yes. I think, again, we have\nto be very careful about it. And if it emerges spontaneously,\nwe need to be careful. Again, we can't rule out\nthe possibility that AI will develop consciousness. We don't know enough about\nconsciousness to be sure. So if it develops spontaneously, we need to be very careful about how we understand it. But if people intentionally\ndesign an AI that they know, they assume, it has no consciousness, but in order to manipulate\npeople, they use, again, this human strength, this human, the noble part of our nature against us. This should be forbidden. And similarly, on a general level, that it should be forbidden\nfor an AI to pretend to be a human being. That it's okay, you know, there are so many things we\ncan use AIs, as teachers, as doctors and so forth. And it's good as long\nas we know that we are interacting with an AI, we should, the same way we ban fake money,\nwe should ban fake humans. It's not just banning deep\nfakes of specific individuals. It's also banning deep\nfake of generic humans. You know, which is already\nhappening to some extent on social media. Like if you have lots of\nbots retweeting something, then you have the impression, oh, lots of people are interested in that. That's important. And this is basically the\nbots pretending to be humans. Because if you see a tweet\nwhich says 500 people retweeted it, or you see\na tweet and it says 500 bots retweeted it, I don't\ncare what the bots retweeted, but if it's humans,\nokay, that's interesting. So we need to be very careful\nthat bots can't do that. They are doing it at present\nand it should be banned. Now, some people say yes, but\nfreedom of expression, no, bots don't have freedom of expression. There is no cost in terms\nof freedom of expression when you ban bots. So again, in some situations, yes, AIs should interact with us,\nbut it should be very clear, this is an AI talking to you, or this is an AI retweeting this story. It is not a human being\nmaking a conscious decision. - To push back on this\nline of fake humans. 'Cause I think it might be a spectrum. First of all, you might have\nAI systems that are offended, hurt when you say that\nthey're fake humans. In fact, they might start\nidentifying as humans. And you just talked about\nthe power of us humans with our collective intelligence\nto take fake stories and make them quite real. And so if the feelings you have\nfor the fake human is real, you know, love is a kind\nof fake thing that we all kinda put a word to a set of feelings. What if you have that\nfeeling for an AI system? It starts to change. I mean, maybe the kind of\nthings AI systems are allowed to do, for good they're allowed to create, communicate suffering,\ncommunicate it, the good stuff, the longing, the hope, the\nconnection, the intimacy, all of that. And in that way get\nintegrated in our society. And then you start to ask a\nquestion on are we allowed to really unplug them? Are we allowed to really censor them? Remove their voice from-\n- I'm not saying- - Social media. - They shouldn't have a voice. They shouldn't talk with us. I'm just saying, when they talk with us, it should be clear that they are AI. That's it. Don't... You can have your voice as an AI. Again, I have some medical problem. I want to get advice from\nan AI doctor. That's fine. As long as I know that\nI'm talking with an AI. That what should be banned\nis AI pretending to be a human being. This is something that will erode trust. And without trust, society collapses. This is something that especially will endanger democracies, because\ndemocracies are built on, democracy is a conversation basically. And it's a conversation between people. If you now flood the\npublic sphere with millions and potentially billions\nof AI agents that can hold conversations, they\nnever sleep, they never eat, they don't have emotions of their own. They can get to know you and tailor their words specifically\nfor you and your life story. They are becoming better\nthan us at creating stories and ideas and so forth. If you flood the public sphere with that, this will ruin the\nconversation between people. It will ruin the trust between people. You will no longer be\nable to have a democracy in this situation. You can have other types of\nregimes, but not democracy. - If we could talk about\nthe big philosophical notion of truth then, you've\nalready talked about these, the capacity of humans. One of the things that\nmade us special is stories. So is there such thing as truth? - Absolutely.\n- What is truth? - When somebody is suffering, that's true. I mean, this is why one of the things, when you talk about suffering as a kind of alternate reality, when\nsomebody suffers, that is truth. Now, somebody can suffer\nbecause of a fictional story. Like somebody tells people that God said, you must go on this crusade\nand kill these heretics. And this is a completely fictional story, and people believe it and they start a war and they destroy cities and kill people. The people that suffer because of that, and even the crusaders\nthemselves that also suffer the consequences of what they do, the suffering is true\neven though it is caused by a fictional story. Similarly, when people\nagree on certain rules, the rules could come\nout of our imagination. Now, we can be truthful\nabout it and say these rules, they didn't come from heaven, they came from our imagination. You know, we look at sports, so you have rules for the\ngame of football, soccer, they were invented by people. Nobody, at least very few\npeople claim that the rules of football came down from heaven. - Yes.\n- We invented them. And this is truthful. They are fictional rules\ninvented by humans. And this is true. They\nwere invented by humans. And when you are honest about\nit, it enables you to change the rules, which is being done in football every now and then. It's the same with the\nfundamental rules of a country. You can pretend that the\nrules came down from heaven, dictated by God or whatever, and then you can't change them. Or you can be like, you know,\nthe American constitution, which starts with \"We, the people.\" The American constitution lays down certain rules for a society. But the amazing thing about it, it does not pretend to come\nfrom an external source. The 10 Commandments start with, \"I am your Lord God.\" And because it starts with\nthat, you can't change them. You know, the 10th commandment, for instance, supports slavery. The 10th commandment,\nin the 10th commandment, it says that you should not\ncovet your neighbor's house or your neighbor's wife\nor your neighbor's slaves. It's okay to hold slaves\naccording to the 10th commandment. It's just bad to covet the\nslaves of your neighbor. Now there is no 11th\ncommandment which says, if you don't like some of\nthe previous 10 Commandments, this is how you go about amending them. Which is why we still have them unchanged. Now, in the US constitution\nyou have all these rights and rules, including originally\nthe ability to hold slaves. But the genius of the founding fathers of the United States,\nthey had the humility to understand maybe we\ndon't understand everything. Maybe we made some mistakes. So we tell you that these\nrules did not come from heaven, they came from us humans,\nwe may have made a mistake, so here is a mechanism\nfor how future generations can amend the constitution,\nwhich was used later on to, for instance, amend the\nConstitution to ban slavery. - So now you're describing\nsome interesting and powerful ideas\nthroughout human history. Can you just speak to the\nmechanism of how humans believe, start to believe ideas? Is there something interesting to say there from your thinking about it? Like how idea is born\nand how it takes hold and how it spreads and how\nit competes with other ideas? - First of all, ideas are an\nindependent force in history. Marxists tend to deny that. Marxists think that all\nhistory is just a play of material interests, and ideas, stories, they are just a smokescreen to hide the underlying interests. My thoughts are to some\nextent the opposite. We have some biological\nobjective interests that all humans share. Like we need to eat, we need\nto drink, we need to breathe. But most conflicts in\nhistory are not about that. The interests which\nreally drive most conflict in history don't come from biology. They come from religions\nand ideologies and stories. So it's not that stories\nare a smokescreen to hide the real interests. The stories create the\ninterests in the first place. The stories define who\nare the competing groups. Nations, religions, cultures, they are not biological entities. They're not like species like\ngorillas and chimpanzees. No. Israelis and Palestinians\nor Germans and French or Chinese and Americans, they have no essential biological\ndifference between them. The difference is cultural.\nIt comes from stories. There are people that\nbelieve in different stories. The stories create the identity, the stories create the interests. Israelis and Palestinians\nare fighting over Jerusalem not because of any material interest. There are no oil fields under\nJerusalem, and even oil, you need it to realize\nsome cultural fantasy. It doesn't really come from biology. So the stories are independent forces. Now, why do people believe\none story and not another? That's history. There\nis no materialistic law. People will always believe this... No, history is full of accidents. How did Christianity\nbecome the most successful religion in the world? We can't explain it. Why this story about Jesus of\nNazareth and not, you know, the Roman Empire in the third\ncentury CE was a bit like, I don't know, California today, like so many sects and subsects and gurus and like everybody has their own thing. - Yeah.\n- And you have, you know, thousands of different stories competing. Why did Christianity come up on top? As a historian, I don't\nhave a kind of clear answer. You can read the sources\nand you see how it happened. Oh, this happened and then this happened and then Constantine adopted it and then this and then this. But why? I don't think\nanybody has an answer to that. If you rewind the movie\nof history and press play and you rewind and press play 100 times, I think Christianity would\ntake over the Roman empire in the world maybe twice out of 100 times. It was such an unlikely thing to happen. And it's the same with Islam. It's the same, I don't know, with the communist takeover of Russia. In 1914, if you told\npeople that in three years Lenin and the Bolsheviks will gain power in Tsarist Empire, they would\nthink you're utterly crazy. You know, Lenin had a few\nthousand supporters in 1914 in an Empire of close\nto 200 million people. It sounded ludicrous. Now, we know the chain of events, the First World War, the\nFebruary Revolution and so forth that led to the communist takeover. But it was such an unlikely\nevent. And it happened. - And the little steps along the way, the little options you have\nalong the way 'cause, you know, Stalin versus Trotsky, you could have the Robert Frost poem. There's always...\n- Yes. - (laughs) Always comes to... - And history often takes, you know, there is a highway and\nthere is a kind of side way. And history takes the sideway.\n- Yeah. - Many, many times. - And it's perhaps tempting to tell some of that history through\ncharismatic leaders. And maybe it's an open question, how much power charismatic\nleaders have to affect the trajectory of history. - You've met quite a lot of\ncharismatic leaders lately. I mean, what's your view on that? - I find it a compelling notion. I'm a sucker for a great\nspeech and a vision. So I have a sense that\nthere's an importance for a leader to catalyze the\nviral spread of a story, as, so like, I think we need leaders to be just great storytellers\nthat kind of sharpen up the story to make sure it infiltrates everybody's brain effectively. But it could also be that\nthe local interactions between humans is even more important. But it's just, we don't\nhave a good way to sort of summarize that and describe that. We like to talk about, you know, Steve Jobs as central to the\ndevelopment of the computer, maybe Bill Gates. And you tell it to the stories\nof individuals like this, 'cause it's just easier to\ntell a sexy story that way. - Maybe it's an interplay\nbecause you have the kind of structural forces that, I don't know, you look at the geography\nof the planet and you look at shipping technology in late, in the late 15th century in\nEurope and the Mediterranean. And it's almost inevitable\nthat pretty quickly somebody will discover America, somebody from the Old World will\nget to the New World. So this was not a kind of, if it wasn't Columbus then\nit would've been a five years later somebody else. But the key thing about history is that these small differences make a huge, huge difference. You know, if it wasn't\nColumbus, if it was five years later somebody from\nEngland, then maybe all of Latin America today would be speaking English and not Spanish. If it was somebody from\nthe Ottoman Empire, it's completely different world history. If you have, and you know, the Ottoman Empire at that\ntime was also shaping up to be a major maritime empire. If you have America reached, being reached by Muslim navigators before Christian navigators\nfrom Europe, you have a completely different world history. It's the same with the computer. Given the economic\nincentives and the science and technology of the time, then the rise of the personal computer was probably inevitable sometime\nin the late 20th century. But the where and when is crucial. The fact that it was California\nin the 1970s and not, say, I don't know Japan in the 1980s or China in the 1990s, this\nmade a huge, huge difference. So you have this interplay\nbetween the structural forces, which are beyond the control of any single charismatic leader. But then the small changes,\nthey can have a big effect. And I think, for instance, about the war in Ukraine,\nthere was a moment, now it's a struggle between nations, but there was a moment\nwhen the decision was taken in the mind of a single\nindividual of Vladimir Putin. And he could have decided otherwise. And the world would've\nlooked completely different. - And another leader, Vladimir Zelensky, could\nhave decided to leave Kiev in the early days. There's a lot of decisions\nthat kind of ripple. - Yeah.\n- So you write in \"Homo Deus\" about Hitler, and in part that he was not a very impressive person. - Did I say that? - The quote is, let me read it. - Okay. (laughs)\n- He wasn't a senior officer, in\nfour years of war he rose no higher than the rank of corporal. He had no formal education...\nPerhaps you mean his resume. - Yeah, yeah. His resume was\nnot impressive, that's true. - He had no formal education,\nno professional skills, no political background. He wasn't a successful\nbusinessman or a union activist. He didn't have friends or\nrelatives in high places nor any money to speak of. So how did he amass so much power? What ideology, what\ncircumstances enabled the rise of the 3rd Reich? - Hmm. Again, I can't tell you the why. I can tell you the how. I\ndon't think it was inevitable. I think that a few, if a\nfew things were different, there would've been no 3rd Reich, there would've\nbeen no Nazism, no Holocaust. Again, this is the tragedy. If it would've been\ninevitable, then, you know, what can you do? This is the laws of history\nor the laws of physics. But the tragedy is, no, it was decisions by humans\nthat led to that direction. And, you know, even from the viewpoint of the Germans, we know for a fact, it was an unnecessary path to take. 'Cause you know, in the\n1920s and 30s, the Nazis said that this, unless Germany take this road, it will never be prosperous,\nit will never be successful. All the other countries\nwill keep stepping on it. This was their claim. And we\nknow for a fact this is false. Why? Because they took that road, they lost the Second World War. And after they lost, then they became one of the\nmost prosperous countries in the world because their\nenemies that defeated them, evidently supported them and\nallowed them to become such a prosperous and successful nation. So, you know, if you can\nlose the war and still be so successful, obviously you could just have skipped the war. You didn't need it. I mean, you really had to\nhave the war in order to have a prosperous Germany in the... Absolutely not. And it's\nthe same with Japan. It's the same with Italy.\nSo it was not inevitable. It was not the forces of\nhistory that necessitated, forced Germany to take this path. I think part of it is part\nof the appeal of, again, Hitler was a very, very\nskillful storyteller. He sold people a story. The fact that he was\nnobody made it even more effective because people, at that time, after the defeat of the First World War, after the repeated economic\ncrisis of the 1920s in Germany, people felt betrayed by\nall the established elites, by all the established institutions. All these professors and politicians and industrialists and\nmilitary, all the big people. They led us to a disastrous\nwar. They led us to humiliation. So we don't want any of them. And then you have this nobody,\na corporal, with no money, with no education, with\nno titles, with nothing. And he tells people, I'm one of you. And this made him, this was one reason why he was so popular. And then the story he told, when you look at stories\nand the competition between different stories\nand between stories, fiction and the truth... The truth has two big problems. The truth tends to be\ncomplicated and the truth tends to be painful. The real story of, let's\ntalk about nations. The real story of every\nnation is complicated and it contains some painful episodes. We are not always good. We\nsometimes do bad things. Now, if you go to people and you tell them a complicated and painful story, many of them don't want to listen. The advantage of fiction\nis that it can be made as simple and as painless\nor attractive as you want it to be because it's fiction. And then what you see is that politicians, like Hitler, they create\na very simple story. We are the heroes. We\nalways do good things. Everybody's against us.\nEverybody's trying to trample us. And this is very attractive. One of the things people don't understand about Nazism and fascism, we teach in schools about fascism and Nazism as this ultimate evil, the ultimate monster in human history. And at some level this is wrong, because it make people,\nit actually exposes us. Why? 'Cause people hear, oh,\nfascism is this monster. And then when you hear\nthe actual fascist story, what fascists tell you is always very beautiful and attractive. Fascists are people who come and tell you, you are wonderful. You belong to the most\nwonderful group of people in the world. You are beautiful, you are ethical. Everything you do is good. You have never done anything wrong. There are all these evil\nmonsters out there that are out to get you. And they are causing all\nthe problems in the world. And when people hear that, you know, it's like looking in the mirror and seeing something very beautiful. Hey, I'm beautiful. We've\nnever done anything wrong. We are victims. Everybody is... And when you look and you\nheard in school that fascism, that fascists are monsters,\nand you look in the mirror, you see something very\nbeautiful and you say, I can't be a fascist because\nfascists are monsters and this is so beautiful, so it can't be. But when you look in the fascist mirror, you never see a monster. You see the most beautiful\nthing in the world. And that's the danger. This is the problem, you know,\nwith Hollywood's, you know, I look at Voldemort in\nHarry Potter, who would like to follow this creep?\n- Yeah. - And you look at Darth\nVader, this is not somebody you would like to follow. Christianity got things much\nbetter when he described the devil as being very\nbeautiful and attractive. That's the danger, that you see something is very beautiful. You don't understand\nthe monster underneath. - And you're right precisely about this. And by the way, it's just a small aside, it always saddens me when people say, how obvious it is to them that communism is a flawed ideology. When you ask them, try to put your mind, try to put yourself in the\nbeginning of the 20th century and see what you would do. A lot of people will say, it's obvious that it's a flawed ideology. So I mean, I suppose to\nsome of the worst ideologies in human history, you could say the same. And in that mirror, when you\nlook, it looks beautiful. - Communism is the same. Also, you look in the communist mirror, you are the most ethical,\nwonderful person ever. It's very difficult to\nsee Stalin underneath it. - So \"Homo Deus,\" you also write, during the 19th and 20th centuries, as humanism gained\nincreasing social credibility and political power, it sprouted two very different offshoots, socialist humanism, which encompassed a plethora of socialists and communist movements,\nand evolutionary humanism, whose most famous\nadvocates were the Nazis. So if you can just linger on that, what's the ideological connection between Nazism and communism\nas embodied by humanism? - And humanism basically is, you know, the focus is on humans, that they are the most\nimportant thing in the world. They move history. But then there is a big\nquestion, what are humans? What is humanity? Now, liberals, they place at the center of the story individual humans. And they don't see history as a kind of necessary collision between big forces. They place the individual at the center. If you want to know, you\nknow, there is a bad, especially in the US today, liberal is taken as the\nopposite of conservative. But to test whether you are liberal, you need to answer just three questions. Very simple. Do you think people should\nhave the right to choose their own government or\nthe government should be imposed by some outside force? Do you think people should have the right to the liberty to choose\ntheir own profession or either born into some\ncast that predetermines what they do? And do you think people\nshould have the liberty to choose their own\nspouse and their own way of personal life instead\nof being told by elders or parents who to marry and how to live? Now, if you answered yes\nto all three questions, people should have the liberty\nto choose their government, their profession, their\npersonal lives, their spouse, then you're a liberal. And most conservatives are also liberal. Now, communists and fascists,\nthey answer differently. For them history is not,\nyes, history is about humans. Humans are the big heroes of history, but not individual humans\nand their liberties. Fascists imagine history as a clash between races or nations. The nation is at the center. They say the supreme good\nis the good of the nation. You should have 100%\nloyalty only to the nation. You know, liberals say, yes, you should be loyal to the nation, but it's not the only thing. There are other things in\nthe world, the human rights, there is truth, there is beauty. Many times, yes, you\nshould prefer the interests of your nation over other\nthings, but not always. If your nation tells\nyou to murder millions of innocent people, you don't do that, even though the nation tells you to do it. To lie for the national interest... You know, in extreme\nsituations, maybe, but in many cases, your loyalty\nshould be to the truth, even if it makes your nation looks a bit, not in the best light,\nthe same with beauty. You know, how does the fascists determine whether a movie is a good movie? Very simple. If it serves the interest of the nation, this is a good movie. If it's against the\ninterest of the nation, this is a bad movie. End of story. Liberalism says, no,\nthere is aesthetic values in the world, we should judge movies not just on that question whether they serve the national interest, but\nalso on artistic value. Communists are a bit like the fascists, instead that they don't place\nthe nation as the main hero. They place class as the main hero. For them history, again,\nit's not about individuals, it's not about nations. History is the clash between classes. And just as fascists\nimagine in the end only one nation will be on top, the communists think in the\nend only one class should be on top. And that's the proletariat. And same story, 100% of your loyalty\nshould be to the class. And like if there is a\nclash tag between class and family, class wins. Like in the Soviet Union,\nthe party told children, if you hear your parents say something bad about Stalin, you have to report them. And there are many cases\nwhen children reported their parents and their\nparents were sent to the Gulag. Like, and you know, your\nloyalty is to the party, which leads the proletariat to victory in the historical struggle. And the same way in communism, art is only about class struggle, and\nmovie's good if it serves the interest of the proletariat. Artistic values? There\nis nothing like that. And the same with truth. Everything that we see now\nin fake news, you know, the communist propaganda\nmachine was there before us. The level of lies, of disinformation campaigns\nthat they orchestrated in the 1920s and '30s and\n'40s is really unimaginable. - So the reason these two ideologies, classes of ideologies failed\nis the sacrifice the truth, not just failed, but did a lot of damage, is sacrifice the truth\nand sacrifice the beauty. - And sacrifice of hundreds\nof millions of people. Disregard, again, for human suffering. Like, okay, for, in order\nto, for our nation to win, in order for our class to win, we need to kill those\nmillions, kill those millions. That was an ethics, aesthetics,\ntruth... They don't matter. The only thing that matter\nis the victory of the state or the victory of the class. And that's the, liberalism\nwas the antithesis to that. It says, no, not only it's, it has a much more\ncomplicated view of the world and both communism and fascism. They have a very simple view of the world. There is one, your loyalty, 100% of it should be only to one thing. Now, liberalism has a much\nmore complex view of the world. It says, yes, there are\nnations, they are important. Yes, there are classes,\nthey are important. But they are not the only thing. There are also families,\nthere are also individuals. There are also animals. And your loyalty should be\ndivided between all of them. Sometimes you prefer this,\nsometimes you prefer that. That's complicated. And, but,\nyou know, life is complicated. - But also, I think\nmaybe you can correct me, but liberalism acknowledges\nthe corrupting nature of power, when there's a guy at the top, sits there for a while, managing things, he is probably gonna\nstart losing a good sense of reality and losing the\ncapability to be a good manager. It feels like the communist\nand fascist regimes don't acknowledge that\nbasic characteristic of human nature, that power corrupts. - Yes. They believe in infallibility. - Yeah.\n- They're, in this sense, they're very close to being religions. In Nazism, Hitler was\nconsidered infallible, and therefore you don't\nneed any checks and balances on his power. Why do you need to balance\nan infallible genius? And it's the same with the Soviet Union with\nStalin and more generally with the Communist party, the Party can never make a mistake, and therefore you don't\nneed independent courts, independent media, opposition\nparties, things like that. Because the Party is never wrong. You concentrate the same way, 100% of loyalty should be to the Party, 100% of power should be\nin the hands of the Party. The whole idea of liberal democracy is embracing fallibility. Everybody is fallible. All people or leaders or\npolitical parties or institutions. This is why we need checks and balances, and we need many of them. If you have just one, then this particular check itself could make terrible mistakes. So you need, say, you need a press, you need the media to serve\nas a check to the government. You don't have just one\nnewspaper or one TV station. We need many, so that they\ncan balance each other. And the media's not enough. So if you have independent courts. You have free academic\ninstitutions. You have NGOs. You have a lot of checks and balances. - So that's the ideologies\nand the leaders. What about the individual people, the millions of people\nthat play a part in all of this that are the hosts of the stories that are the catalyst and the\nsort of the components of how the story spreads. Would you say that all of\nus are capable of spreading any story, sort of the Solzhenitsyn idea of that all of us are\ncapable of good and evil. The line between good and evil\nruns the heart of every man. - Yes. I wouldn't say that\nevery person is capable of every type of evil,\nbut we are all fallible. There is a large element... It partly depends on the\nefforts we make to develop our self-awareness during life. Part of it depends on moral luck. You know, if you are born as a Christian German\nin the 1910s or 1920s, and you grow up in Nazi\nGermany, that's bad moral luck. Your chances of committing\nterrible things, you have a very high chance of doing it. And you can withstand it, but it'll will take tremendous effort. If you are born in Germany after the war, you are morally lucky\nthat you will not be put to such a test. You will not need to exert\nthese enormous efforts not to commit atrocities. So there is an, this is\njust part of history. There is an element of luck. But again, part of it\nis also self-awareness. And you asked me earlier\nabout the potential of power to corrupt. And I listened to the\ninterview you just did with Prime Minister Netanyahu\na couple of days ago. And one of the things that most struck me during the interview that\nyou asked him, you asked him, are you afraid of this\nthing, that power corrupts? He didn't think for a single second. He didn't pose, he didn't\nadmit a tiny little level of, you know, a doubt or... No. Power doesn't corrupt. It was, for me, it was a\nshocking and a revealing moment. And it kind of dovetails with\nhow you began the interview, that I really liked your\nopening gambit, that, kind of... No, really, you kind\nof told him, you know, lots of people in the\nworld are angry with you. Some people hate you. They dislike you. What do you want to tell\nthem, to say to them? And you gave him this kind of platform. And I was very, what will he\nsay? And he just denied it. He basically denied it. You know, he had to\ncut short the interview from three hours to one\nhour because he had hundreds of thousands of Israelis in the streets demonstrating against him. And he goes and saying,\nno, everybody likes me. What are you talking about? - But on that topic, you've said recently that the Prime Minister,\nBenjamin Netanyahu, may go down in history as the\nman who destroys Israel. Can you explain what you mean by that? - Yes. I mean, he is basically\ntearing apart the social contract that held this\ncountry together for 75 years. He's destroying the foundations\nof Israeli democracy. You know, I don't want to go too deep, and unless you want it, because I guess most of our listeners, they have bigger issues on\ntheir minds than the fate of some small country in the Middle East. But for those who want to\nunderstand what's happening in Israel, there is really\njust one question to ask. What limits the power of the government? In United States, for instance, there are lots of checks\nand balances that limit the power of the government. You have the Supreme Court, you have the Senate, you have the\nHouse of Representative, you have the President,\nyou have the Constitution, you have 50 states,\neach state with its own Constitution and Supreme Court\nand Congress and Governor... If somebody wants to pass a\ndangerous legislation, say, in the House, it will have to go through so many obstacles... Like if you want to pass\na law in United States, taking away voting rights from Jews or from Muslims or from African-Americans, even if it passes, even\nif it has a majority in the House of Representatives,\nit has a very, very, very small chance of becoming\nthe law of the country. Because it'll have to pass again through the Senate, through the President, through the Supreme Court and all the federal structure. In Israel, we have just a\nsingle check on the power of the government. And that's the Supreme Court. There is really no difference\nbetween the government and the legislature,\nbecause whoever there is, there are no separate\nelections like in the US. If you win majority in the\nKnesset, in the Parliament, you appoint the government. That's very simple. And if you have 61 members of Knesset who vote, let's say, on a law to take away voting\nrights from Arab citizens of Israel, there is a single\ncheck that can prevent it from becoming the law of the land. And that's the Supreme Court. And now the Netanyahu government is trying to neutralize or take over the Supreme Court, and\nthey've already prepared a long list of laws. They already talk about it. What will happen the\nmoment that this last check on the power is gone, they are openly trying\nto gain unlimited power. And they openly talk about\nit, that once they have it, then they will take away the rights of Arabs, of LGBT people,\nof women, of secular Jews. And this is why you have\nhundreds of thousands of people in the streets. You have air force pilots saying, we stopped flying. This is unheard of in Israel. I mean, we are still living\nunder existential threat from Iran, from other enemies. And in the middle of this, you have air force pilots\nwho dedicated their lives to protecting the country. And they're saying, that's it. If this government doesn't\nstop what it is doing, we stop flying. - So, as you said, I just did the interview\nand as we were doing the interview, there's\nprotests in the streets. Do you think the protests\nwill have an effect? - I hope so very much. I'm\ngoing to many of these protests. I hope they will have an effect. If we fail, this is the end of\nIsraeli democracy, probably. This will have repercussions far beyond the borders of Israel. Israel is a nuclear power. Israel has one of the most advanced cyber capabilities in the world, able to strike basically\nanywhere in the world. If this country becomes a fundamentalist and militarist dictatorship,\nit can set fire to the entire Middle East. It can, again, have\ndestabilizing effects long, far beyond the borders of Israel. - So you think without the\ncheck on power is possible that the Netanyahu government\nholds on to power... - Nobody tries to gain unlimited\npower just for nothing. I mean, you have so many problems in Israel, and Netanyahu talks so much about Iran and the\nPalestinians and Hezbollah. We have an economic crisis. Why is it so urgent at this moment, in the face of such opposition, why is it so crucial\nfor them to neutralize the Supreme Court? They're just doing it for the fun of it? No, they know what they are doing. they are adamant, again, we\nare not sure of it before. There was a, like a couple of months ago, they came out with this plan to take over the Supreme Court,\nto have all these laws. And there were hundreds\nof thousands of people in the streets, again, soldiers saying they will stop serving, a general strike in the economy. And they stopped. And they started a process\nof negotiations to try and enrich a settlement. And then they broke down, they stopped the negotiations\nand they restarted this process of legislation\ntrying to gain unlimited power. So any doubt we had before, okay, maybe they changed their purposes. No, it's now very clear. They are 100% focused on\ngaining absolute power. They are not trying a different tactic. Previously they took,\nthey had all these dozens of laws that they wanted\nto pass very quickly, within a month or two,\nthey realized, no, this is, there is too much opposition. So now they're doing what\nis known as salami tactics, slice by slice. Now they're trying to,\none law, if this succeeds, then they'll pass the\nnext one and the next one and the next one. This is why we are now\nat a very crucial moment. And when you see, again, hundreds of thousands\nof people in the streets almost every day, when\nyou're seeing resistance within the armed forces,\nwithin the security forces, you see high tech companies\nsay, we will go on strike. You know, it's our private\nbusinesses, high tech companies. I think it's almost unprecedented for a private business\nto go on strike because what will economic success\nbenefit us if we live under a messianic dictatorship? And again, the fuel for\nthis whole thing is, to a large extent, coming from\nMessianic religious groups, which, just the thought, what happens if these people\nhave unlimited control of Israel's nuclear arsenal and Israel's military capabilities\nand cyber capabilities. This is very, very scary. Not just for the citizens of Israel. It should be scary for people everywhere. - So it would be scary\nfor it to go from being a problem of security\nand protecting the peace to becoming a religious war. - It is already becoming a religious war. I mean, the war, the conflict with the\nPalestinians was for many years a national conflict, in essence. Over the last few years,\nmaybe a decade or two, it is morphing into religious\nconflict, which is again, a very worrying development. When nations are in conflict, you can reach some compromise. Okay, you have this bit of\nland, we have this bit of land. But when it becomes a religious conflict between fundamentalists,\nbetween messianic people, compromise becomes much more difficult because you don't compromise on eternity. You don't compromise on God. And this is where we\nare heading right now. - So I know you said it's\na small nation somewhere in the Middle East, but\nit also happens to be the epicenter of one\nof the longest running, one of the most tense conflicts and crises in human history. So at the very least, it serves as a study of how\nconflict can be resolved. So what are the biggest obstacles to you to achieving peace\nin this part of the world? - Motivation. I think it's easy to\nachieve peace if you have the motivation on both sides. Unfortunately at the present juncture, there is not enough\nmotivation on either side, either the Palestinian or Israeli side. Peace, you know, in\nmathematics you have problems without solutions, you\ncan prove mathematically that this mathematical\nproblem has no solution. In politics, there is no such thing. All problems have solutions\nif you have the motivation. And, but motivation is the big problem. And again, we can go into the reasons why, but the fact is that on neither side is there enough motivation. If there was motivation, the\nsolution would've been easy. - Is there an important\ndistinction to draw between the people on the\nstreet and the leaders in power in terms of motivation? So are most people motivated and hoping for peace and the leaders are\nmotivated and incentivized to continue war? - I don't think so.\n- Or the people also? - I think it's a deep\nproblem. It's also the people. It's not just the leaders. - Is it even a human\nproblem of literally hate in people's heart? - Yeah, there is a lot of hate. One of the things that happened\nin Israel over the last 10 years or so, Israel became much stronger\nthan it was before, largely thanks to\ntechnological developments. And it feels that it no\nlonger needs to compromise. That again, this is, there\nare many reasons for it, but some of them are technological. Being one of the leading powers in cyber, in AI, in high tech, we have developed very\nsophisticated ways to more easily control the Palestinian population. In the early 2000s, it seemed that it is becoming\nimpossible to control millions of people against their will. It took too much power, it spilled too much blood on both sides. So there was an impression,\noh, this is becoming untenable. And there were several\nreasons why it changed, but one of them was new technology. Israel developed very sophisticated surveillance technology\nthat has made it much easier for Israeli security forces to control 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank against their will, with a lot less effort,\nless boots on the ground, also less blunt. And Israel is also now\nexporting this technology to many other regimes around the world. Again, I heard Netanyahu\nspeaking about all the wonderful things that Israel\nis exporting to the world. And it's true, we are\nexporting some nice things, water systems and new kinds of tomatoes. We are also exporting a lot of weapons and especially surveillance systems, sometimes to unsavory regimes, in order to control their populations. - Can you comment on, I think you've mentioned\nthat the current state of affairs is the defacto\nthree class state. Can you describe what you mean by that? - Yes. For many years, the\nkind of leading solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the two-state solution. - Can you describe what\nthat means, by the way? - Yes. Two states within,\nbetween the Jordan River, and the Mediterranean,\nwe'll have two states. Israel is a predominantly Jewish state, and Palestine is a\npredominantly Palestinian state. Again, there were lots of discussions where the border passes, what happens with security\narrangement and whatever. But this was the big solution. Israel is basically abandoned\nthe two-state solution. Maybe they don't say so\nofficially, the people in power, but in terms of how they actually, what they do on the\nground, they abandoned it. Now they are effectively\npromoting the three class solution, which means\nthere is just one country and one government and one power between the Mediterranean\nand the Jordan River. But you have three classes\nof people living there. You have Jews, who enjoy\nfull rights, all the rights. You have some Arabs who\nare Israeli citizens and have some rights. And then you have the other\nArabs, the third class who have basically no civil rights and limited human rights. And that's, again, nobody\nwould openly speak about it. But effectively, this is the\nreality on the ground already. - So there's many, and I'll speak with the\nPalestinians who characterize this as a defacto one state apartheid. So you agree with this?\n- I would take issue, I would take issue with\nthe term apartheid. Generally speaking as a historian, I don't really like historical analogies because there are always differences. Key differences. The biggest difference\nbetween the situation here and the situation in\nSouth Africa in the time of the apartheid is that\nthe black South Africans did not deny the existence of\nSouth Africa and did not call for the destruction of South Africa. They had a very simple goal.\nThey had a very simple demand. We want to be equal citizens\nof this country. That's it. And the apartheid regime was, no, you can't be equal citizens. Now in Israel-Palestine, it's different. The Palestinians, many\nof them don't recognize the existence of Israel, are not willing to recognize it. And they don't demand to\nbe citizens of Israel. They demand, some of them\nto destroy it and replace it with the Palestinians state, some of them demand a separate state. But you know, if the\nPalestinians would adopt the same policy as the\nblack South Africans, if you have the Palestinians coming and saying, okay, forget about it. We don't want to destroy Israel. We don't know a Palestinian country. We have a very simple\nrequest, very simple demand. Give us our full rights. We also want to vote to the Knesset. We also want to get the\nfull protection of the law. That's it. That's our only demand. Israel will be in deep-deep\ntrouble at that moment, but we are not there. - I wonder if there will\never be a future when such a thing happens, where everybody,\nthe majority of people, Arab and Jew, Israeli and\nPalestinian, accept the one state solution and say,\nwe want equal rights. - Never say never in history. It's not coming any time\nsoon from either side. When you look at the long term of history, one of the curious things you see, and that what makes us different, human groups from animal\nspecies, you know, gorillas and chimpanzees,\nthey're separate species. They can never merge. Cats\nand dogs will never merge. But different national and\nreligious groups in history, even when they hate each\nother, surprisingly, they sometimes end by merging. If you look at Germany, for instance, so for centuries you had\nPrussians and Bavarians and Saxons who fought\neach other ferociously and hated each other. And there are sometimes\nalso different religions, Catholics, Protestants, you know, the worst war in European history, according to some measures, was not the Second World\nWar or the First World War. It was the 30 years war, waged largely on German soil, between Germans,\nProtestants and Catholics. But eventually they united\nto form a single country. You saw the same thing,\nI don't know, in Britain. English and Scotts for\ncenturies hated and fought each other ferociously,\neventually coming together. Maybe it'll break up again, I don't know. But the power of the kind of\nforces of merger in history, you are very often influenced\nby the people you fight, by the people you even hate more than by almost anybody else. - So if we apply those ideas, the ideas of this part of the world, to another part of the world\nthat's currently in war, Russia and Ukraine, from\nwhat you learned here, how do you think peace can\nbe achieved in Ukraine? - Oh, this can be achieved\nany moment. It's motivation. In this case, it's just one person. You just, Putin just\nneed to say, that's it. You know, the Ukrainians,\nthey don't demand anything from Russia, just go home. That's the only thing they want. They don't want to conquer\nany bit of Russian territory. They don't want to change the\nregime in Moscow, nothing. They just tell the Russians,\ngo home. That's it. And of course, again, motivation. How do you get somebody like\nPutin to admit that he made a colossal mistake, a human\nmistake, an ethical mistake, a political mistake in starting this war, this is very, very difficult. But in terms of what would\nthe solution look like? Very simple. The Russians\ngo home, end of story. - Do you believe in the\npower of conversation between leaders, to sit down\nas human beings and agree, first of all, what home means? Because we humans draw lines. - That's true. I believe in\nthe power of conversation. The big question to ask is\nwhere, where do conversations, real conversations take place? And this is tricky. One of the interesting things\nto ask about any conflict, about any political system is where do the real conversations take place? And very often they don't\ntake place in the places you think that they are. But think about American politics. When the country was founded\nin the late 18th century, people understood holding\nconversation between leaders is very important for the\nfunctioning of democracy, we'll create a place for that. That's called Congress. This is where leaders are\nsupposed to meet and talk about the main issues of the day. Maybe there was a time, sometime in the past when\nthis actually happened, when you had two factions\nholding different ideas about foreign policy or economic policy, and they met in Congress\nand somebody would come and give a speech and the\npeople all on the other side would say, hey, that's interesting. I haven't thought about it.\nYes, maybe we can agree on that. This is no longer happening in Congress. Nobody, I don't think there is any speech in Congress that causes\nanybody on the other side to change their opinion about anything. So this is no longer a place where real conversations take place. The big question about American democracy is is there a place\nwhere real conversations, which actually change people's\nminds, still take place? If not, then this democracy is dying also. Democracy without conversation\ncannot exist for long. And it's the same question\nyou should ask also about dictatorial regimes. Like you think about Russia or China. So China has the Great Hall of the People, where the representatives,\nthe supposed representative of the people meet every now and then, but no real conversation\ntakes place there. A key question to ask about\nthe Chinese system is, behind closed doors, let's say,\nin a public bureau meeting, do people have a real conversation? If Xi Jinping says one\nthing and some other big shot thinks differently,\nwill they have the courage, the ability, the backbone to\nsay, with all due respect, they think differently and\nthere is a real conversation? Or not? I don't know the answer. But this is a key question. This is the difference, you know, between an authoritarian\nregime can still have different voices within it, but at\na certain point you have a personality cult. Nobody dares say anything\nagainst the leader. And when it comes again to Ukraine and Russia, I\ndon't think that if you get, if you somehow managed to get Putin and Zelensky to the same room, when everybody knows that they\nare there and they'll have a moment of empathy, of human connection and they'll have a... No, I don't think it can happen like that. I do hope that there are\nother spaces where somebody like Putin can still have\na real human conversation. I don't know if this\nis the case. I hope so. - Well, there's several\ninteresting dynamics and you spoke to some of them. So one is internally, with advisors, you have to have hope that there's people that would disagree, that would have a lively\ndebate internally. Then there's also the thing you mentioned, which is direct communication between Putin and Zelensky in\nprivate, picking up a phone, rotary phone, old school. That's, I still believe\nin the power of that. But while that's exceptionally difficult in the current state of affairs. What's also possible to\nhave is a mediator like the United States or some other leader... - Yeah.\n- Like the leader of Israel or the leader of another nation that's\nrespected by both, or India, for example, that can have first of all\nindividual conversations and then literally get\ninto a room together. - It is possible. I would say more generally\nabout conversations as it goes back a little\nto what I said earlier about the Marxist view of history. One of the problematic\nthings I see today in many academic circles is that\npeople focus too much on power. They think that the whole\nof history or the whole of politics is just a power structure. It's just struggle about power. Now, if you think that\nthe whole of history and the whole of politics is only power, then there is no room for conversation. Because if what you have is a struggle between different powerful interests, there is no point talking. The only thing that\nchanges it is fighting. My view is that, no, it's not\nall about power structures. It's not all about power dynamics. Underneath the power\nstructure there are stories, stories in human minds,\nand this is great news, if it's true, this is good\nnews because unlike power, that can only be changed\nthrough fighting, stories can, sometimes, it's not easy, but sometimes stories can\nbe changed through talking and that's the hope. I think, you know, in everything from couple\ntherapy to nation therapy, if you think it's power\ntherapy, it's all about power, there is no place for a conversation. But if to some extent it's\nthe stories in people mind... If you can enable one\nperson to see the story in the mind of another\nperson, and more importantly, if you can have some\nkind of critical distance from the story in your own mind, maybe you can change it a little, and then you don't need to fight. You can actually find a\nbetter story that you can both agree to. It sometimes happens in\nhistory, you know, again, French and Germans fought for\ngenerations and generations, now they live in peace,\nnot because, I don't know, if they found a new planet they can share between France and Germany\nso now everybody has an enough territory. No, they actually have less territory than previously because they lost all their overseas empires. But they managed to find a\nstory, the European story, that both Germans and French\npeople are happy with. So they live in peace. - I very much believe in\nthis vision that you have of the power of stories. And one of the tools is\nconversations. Another is books. There's some guy that\nwrote a book about this, power of stories. He happens to be sitting in front of me. And that happened to spread\nacross a lot of people. And now they believe in the\npower of story and narrative. Even a children's book,\ntoo. So the kids... I mean, it's fascinating how that spreads. I mean, underneath your\nwork there's an optimism. And I think underneath\nconversations is what I try to do is an optimism. That it's not just about power struggles, it's about stories, which\nis like a connection between humans and together, kinda evolving these\nstories that maximize, or minimize suffering in the world. - Yeah, this is why I also, I think I admire what you are doing, that you're going to talk\nwith some of the most difficult characters\naround in the world today. And with this basic belief\nthat by talking maybe we can move them an inch, which is a lot when it comes\nto people with so much power. Like I think one of the\nbiggest success stories in modern history, I\nwould say, is feminism. Because feminism believed\nin the power of stories, not so much in the power of\nviolence, of armed conflict. By many measures, feminism has been maybe the most successful social\nmovement of the 20th century and maybe of the modern age, you know, systems of oppression, which were in place throughout the world\nfor thousands of years. And they seem to be just natural, eternal. You had all these religious movements, all these political revolutions, and one thing remained constant, and this is the patriarchal system and the oppression of women. And then feminism came\nalong and, you know, you had leaders like\nLenin, like Mao, saying that if you want to make\na big social change, you must use violence. Power comes from the barrel of a gun. If you want to make an omelet,\nyou need to break eggs, and all these things. And the feminists said, no, we won't use the power of the gun. We will make an omelet\nwithout breaking any eggs. And they made a much better omelet than Lenin or Mao or any of\nthese violent revolutionaries. I don't think, you know, that... They certainly didn't start\nany wars or built any gulags. I don't think they even\nmurdered a single politician. I don't think there was\nany political assassination anywhere, by feminists. There was a lot of violence against them, both verbal but also physical. And they didn't reply by waging violence. And they succeeded in changing\nthis deep in structure of oppression in a way which\nbenefited not just women, but also men. So this gives me hope that it's not easy, in many cases we fail, but it is possible sometimes\nin history to make a very, very big change, positive change, mainly by talking and\ndemonstrating and changing the story in people's minds,\nand not by using violence. - It's fascinating that\nfeminism and communism and all these things\nhappen in the 20th century. So many interesting things\nhappen in the 20th century. So many movements, so many\nideas, nuclear weapons, all of it, computers. It's just like, it seems\nlike a lot of stuff like really quickly percolated. And it's accelerating. - It's still accelerating. I mean, history is just\naccelerating, you know, for centuries and the\n20th century, you know, we squeezed into it the\nthing that previously took thousands of years. And now, I mean, we are\nsqueezing it into decades. - And you very well could be\none of the last historians, human historians, to have ever lived. - Could be. I think, you know, our\nspecies, homo sapiens, I don't think we'll be\naround in a century or two. We could destroy ourselves\nin a nuclear war, through ecological collapse,\nby giving too much power to AI that goes out of our control. But if we survive, we'll probably have so\nmuch power that we will change ourselves using\nvarious technologies so that our descendants will no longer be homo sapiens like us. They will be more different\nfrom us than we are different from Neanderthals. So maybe they'll have historians, but it will no longer be human historians or sapiens historians like me. I think it's an extremely\ndangerous development. And the chances that this will go wrong, that people will use the new technologies trying to upgrade humans, but actually downgrading them. This is a very, very big danger. If you let corporations and armies and ruthless politicians\nchange humans using tools like AI and bioengineering, it's\nvery likely that they will try to enhance a few human\nqualities that they need, like intelligence and discipline, while neglecting what are\npotentially more important human qualities like compassion, like artistic sensitivity,\nlike spirituality. If you give Putin, for instance, bioengineering and AI and\nbrain computer interfaces, he's likely to want to create\na race of super soldiers who are much more intelligent\nand much more stronger and also much more\ndisciplined and never rebel and march on Moscow against him. But he has no interest in making them more compassionate or more spiritual. So the end result could\nbe a new type of humans, a downgraded humans who\nare highly intelligent and disciplined, but have no compassion\nand no spiritual depth. And this is one, for me, this\nis, you know, the dystopia, the apocalypse, that when people talk about the new technologies and\nthey have this scenario of, you know, the Terminator,\nrobots running in the street, shooting people, this\nis not what worries me. I think we can avoid that. What really worries me is\nusing the corporations, armies, politicians will use the new\ntechnologies to change us in a way which will destroy\nour humanity or the best parts of our humanity. - And one of those ways could\nbe removing the compassion. Another way that really\nworries me for me is probably more likely is a \"Brave\nNew World\" kind of thing that sort of removes the flaws of humans. Maybe it removes the diversity in humans. And makes us all kind of\nthese dopamine chasing creatures that just kind\nof maximize enjoyment in the short term. Which kind of seems like\na good thing, maybe, in the short term, but\nit creates a society that doesn't think, that doesn't create, that just is sitting there enjoying itself, at\na more and more rapid pace, which seems like another\nkind of society that could be easily controlled by a center of power. But the set of dystopias\nthat we could arrive at through this, to rely on\ncorporations to modify humans is vast and we should\nbe worried about that. So it seems like humans\nare pretty good, as we are. All the flaws, all of it together. - We are better than anything that we can intentionally design at present. - Yeah.\n- Like any intentionally designed humans, at the present\nmoment, is going to be much, much worse than us. 'Cause basically we don't\nunderstand ourselves. I mean, as long as we don't\nunderstand our brain, our body, our mind, it's a very, very bad idea to start\nmanipulating a system that you don't understand deeply and we don't understand ourselves. - So I have to ask you\nabout an interesting dynamic of stories. You wrote an article two years ago titled, \"When the World Seems\nLike One Big Conspiracy: How understanding the structure of global cabal theories can\nshed light on their allure and their inherent falsehood.\" What are global cabal\ntheories and why do so many people believe them? 37% of Americans, for example. - Well, the global cabal\ntheory, it has many variations, but basically there is\na small group of people, a small cabal that secretly\ncontrols everything that is happening in the world. All the wars, all the\nrevolutions, all the epidemics, everything that is happening is controlled by this very small group\nof people who are of course evil and have bad intentions. And this is a very well known\nstory that it's not new, it's been there for thousands of years. It's very attractive, because\nfirst of all, it's simple. You don't have to understand everything that happens in the world, you just need to understand one thing. The war in Ukraine, the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, 5G technology, COVID-19, it's simple. There is this global cabal. They do all of it, all of it. And also it enables you to\nshift all the responsibility to all the bad things that are happening in the\nworld to this small cabal. It's the Jews, it's the\nFreemasons, it's not us. And also it creates this\nfantasy, utopian fantasy. If we only get rid of the small cabal, we solved all the problems of the world. Salvation. The Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict, the war in Ukraine, the epidemics, poverty, everything is solved just by\nknocking out this small cabal. So, and it's simple, it's attractive, and this is why so many people believe it. It's, again, it's not new.\nNazism was exactly this. Nazism began as a conspiracy theory. We don't call Nazism a\nconspiracy theory because, oh, it's a big thing, it's an ideology. But if you look at it,\nit's a conspiracy theory. The basic Nazi idea was,\nthe Jews control the world, get rid of the Jews, you solved\nall the world's problems. Now, the interesting thing\nabout these kind of theories, again, they tell you that\neven things that look to be the opposite of each other, actually they are part of the conspiracy. So in the case of Nazism, the\nNazis told people, you know, you have capitalism and communism, you think that they are opposite, right? Ah, this is what the\nJews want you to think. Actually, the Jews control both communism, Trotski, Marx were Jews, blah, blah, blah. And capitalism, the Rothschilds, the Wall Street, it's all\ncontrolled by the Jews. So the Jews are fooling everybody, but actually the communists\nand the capitalists are part of the same global cabal. And again, this is very\nattractive because, ah, now I understand everything\nand I also know what to do. I just give power to Hitler.\nHe gets rid of the Jews. I solve all the problems of the world. Now, as a historian, the most important thing I\ncan say about these theories, they are never right, because the global cabal\ntheory says two things. First, everything is\ncontrolled by a very small number of people. Secondly, these people hide themselves. They do it in secret. Now,\nboth things are nonsense. It's impossible for people\nto control, a small group of people, to control\nand predict everything because the world is too complicated. You know, you look at a\nreal world conspiracy. Conspiracy is basically just a plan. Think about the American\ninvasion of Iraq in 2003. You had the most powerful\nsuperpower in the world, with the biggest military, with the biggest intelligence services, with the most sophisticated, you know, the FBI and the CIA and all the agents. They invade a third rate country,\na third rate power, Iraq. With this idea, we'll take\nover Iraq and we'll control it, we'll make a new order in the Middle East. And everything falls apart.\nTheir plan completely backfires. Everything they hope to achieve,\nthey achieve the opposite. America, United States is humiliated. They cause the rise of ISIS. They wanted to take out terrorism. They created more terrorism. Worst of all, the big\nwinner of the war was Iran. You know, the United\nStates goes to war with all its power and gives Iran a\nvictory on a silver plate. The Iranians don't need to do anything. The Americans are doing\neverything for them. Now, this is real history. Real history is when you\nhave not a small group of people, a lot of people\nwith a lot of power, carefully planning something,\nand it goes completely out of, against their plan. And this we know from\na personal experience, like every time we try to plan something, a birthday party, a\nsurprise birthday party, a trip somewhere, things go wrong. This is reality. So the idea that a small\ngroup of, I don't know, the Jewish cabal, the Freemasons, whoever, they can really control\nand predict all the wars? This is nonsense. The second thing that is\nnonsense is to think they can do that and still remain secret. It sometimes happens in\nhistory that a small group of people accumulates a lot of power. If I now tell you that\nXi Jinping and the heads of the CCP, the Chinese\nCommunist Party, they have a lot of power. They control the military,\nthe media, the economy, the universities of China. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is, obviously, everybody\nknows it. Everybody knows it. Because to gain so much power,\nyou usually need publicity. Hitler could not, Hitler\ngained a lot of power in Nazi Germany because\nhe had a lot of publicity. If Hitler remained unknown,\nworking behind the scenes, he would not gain power. So the way to gain power is\nusually through publicity. So secret cabals don't gain power. And even if you gain a lot of power, nobody has the kind of\npower necessary to predict and control everything\nthat happens in the world. All the time shit happens that you did not predict and you did not plan\nand you did not control. - The sad thing is there's\nusually an explanation for everything you just said that involves a secret global cabal. That the reason your\nvacation planning always goes wrong is because you're not competent. There is a competent small group, that ultra competent small group. I hear this with intelligence agencies. The CIA are running everything. Mossad is running everything. - You see, I mean, as historian, you get to know how many\nblunders these people do. They are so, and they're capable, but they're so incompetent\nin so many ways. Again, look at the Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine. Before the war, people thought, oh, Putin was such a genius and\nthe Russian army was one of the strongest armies in the world. This is what Putin thought,\nand it completely backfired. - Well, a cabal\nexplanation there would be, there's a NATO driven\nUnited States military industrial complex that\nwants to create chaos and- - So they put a gun to\nPutin's head and told him, Vladimir, if you don't\ninvade, we shoot you. How did they cause put into invade? - It's the thing about conspiracy theories is there's usually a way\nto explain everything. - You can explain, it's\nkind of a religion. You can always find\nexplanation for everything. And, you know, in the end,\nit's intellectual integrity. If you insist on whenever people confront you with evidence, with finding some very, very complicated explanation for that too, you can explain everything. We know that. It's a question\nof intellectual integrity. And I will also say another\nthing, the conspiracy theories, they do get one thing right,\ncertainly in today's world, I think they represent an\nauthentic and justified fear of a lot of people that\nthey are losing control of their lives. They don't understand what is happening. And this I think is not\njust a legitimate fear. This is an important fear. They are right. We are losing control of our lives. We are facing really big dangers, but not from a small\ncabal of fellow humans. The problem with many of\nthese conspiracy theories that yes, we have a problem\nwith new AI technology, but if you now direct the\nfire against certain people, so instead of all humans\ncooperating against our real common threats, whether it's the rise of AI,\nwhether it's global warming, you are only causing\nus to fight each other. And I think that the\nkey question that people who spread these ideas,\nI mean many of them, they honestly believe, it's not malicious, that they honestly\nbelieve in these theories, is do you want to spread,\nto spend your life spreading hate towards people or do you want to work on more constructive projects? I think one of the big differences between those who believe\nin conspiracy theories and people who warn about the dangers of AI, the dangers of climate change. We don't see certain\nhumans as evil and hateful. The problem isn't humans, the problem is something outside humanity. Yes, humans are\ncontributing to the problem, but ultimately the enemy\nis external to humanity. Whereas conspiracy theories usually claim that a certain part of humanity\nis the source of all evil, which leads them to\neventually think in terms of exterminating this part of humanity, which leads sometimes to\nhistorical disasters like Nazism. - So it can lead to hate, but it can also lead to a\nlike cynicism and apathy that basically says, it's\nnot in my power to make the world better. So you don't actually take action. - I think it is within the\npower of every individual to make the world a little bit better. You know, you can't do everything. Don't try to do everything. Find one thing in your areas of activity, a place where you have\nsome agency and try to do that and hope that other\npeople do their bit. And if everybody do\ntheir bit, we'll manage. And if we don't, we don't,\nbut at least we try. - You have been part\nof conspiracy theories, I find myself recently becoming part of conspiracy theories. Is there a device you can give\nof how to be a human being in this world that values truth and reason while watching yourself become\npart of conspiracy theories? At least from my perspective, it seems very difficult\nto prove to the world that you're not part\nof a conspiracy theory. I, as you said, have interviewed Benjamin\nNetanyahu recently. I don't know if you're aware, but doing such things will also, you know, pick up a new\nmenu of items that you're, new set of conspiracy\ntheories you're now a part of. And I find it very\nfrustrating because it makes it very difficult to respond, because I sense that people\nhave the right intentions. Like we said, they have\nnervousness, a fear of power. - Yes.\n- And the abuses of power. And... As do I. So I find myself in a difficult position that I have nothing to show\nto prove that I'm not part of such a conspiracy theory. - I think ultimately you can't, we can't. I mean, you know, it's\nlike proving consciousness, you can't, that's just the situation, whatever you say can\nand will be used against you by some people.\n- Yeah. - So this fantasy, if I only say this, if I only show them that,\nif I only have this data, they will see I'm okay.\n- Yeah. - It doesn't work like that. I think to keep your\nsanity in this situation, first of all, it's important\nto understand that most of these people are not evil. They are not doing it on purpose. Many of them really\nbelieve that there is some very nefarious, powerful\nconspiracy which is causing a lot of harm in the world. And they're doing a good\nthing by exposing it and making people aware of\nit and trying to stop it. If you think that you\nare surrounded by evil, you are falling into the same rabbit hole, you are falling into the same\nparanoid state of mind, oh, the world is full of\nthese evil people that... No, most of them are good people. And also I think we\ncan empathize with some of the key ideas there,\nwhich I share, that yes, it's becoming more and more\ndifficult to understand what is happening in the world. There are huge dangers\nin the world that we are, existential dangers to the human species, but they don't come from a small cabal of Jews or gay people or\nfeminists or whatever. They come from much more diffused forces, which are not under the control\nof any single individual. We don't have to look for the evil people. We need to look for human\nallies in order to work together against, again, the\ndangers of AI, the dangers of bioengineering, the\ndangers of climate change. And when you wake up in the\nmorning, the question is, do you want to spend your\nday spreading hatred or do you want to spend your\nday trying to make allies and work together? - Let me ask you kind\nof a big philosophical question about AI and the threat of it. Let's look like at the threat side. So folks like Eliezer\nYudkowsky worry that AI might kill all of us. Do you worry about that\nrange of possibilities where artificial intelligence\nsystems in a variety of ways might destroy human civilization? - Yes. You know, I talk a lot about\nit, about the dangers of AI. I sometimes get into\ntrouble because I depict these scenarios of how AI\nbecoming very dangerous. And then people say that I'm\nencouraging these scenarios. But I'm, you know, I'm\ntalking about it as a warning. I'm not so terrified of\nthe simplistic idea, again, the Terminator scenario of robots running in the street shooting everybody, I'm more worried about AI\naccumulating more and more power and basically\ntaking over society based, taking over our lives, taking power away from us\nuntil we don't understand what is happening and we\nlose control of our lives and of the future. The two most important things\nto realize about AI, now, so many things are being said now about AI, but I think there are two things that every person should know about AI. First is that AI is the\nfirst tool in history that can make decisions by itself. All previous tools in history\ncouldn't make decisions. This is why they empowered us. You invent a knife, you\ninvent an atom bomb... The atom bomb cannot\ndecide to start a war, cannot decide which city to bomb. AI can make decisions by itself. Autonomous weapon systems can decide, by themselves, who to kill, who to bomb. The second thing is that\nAI is the first tool in history that can create\nnew ideas by itself. The printing press could print our ideas, but could not create new ideas. AI can create new ideas\nentirely by itself. This is unprecedented. Therefore, it is the first\ntechnology in history that instead of giving power to humans, it takes power away from us. And the danger is that it\nwill increasingly take more and more power from us\nuntil we are left helpless and clueless about what\nis happening in the world. And this is already beginning to happen in an accelerated pace. More and more decisions, about our lives, whether to give us a loan,\nwhether to give us a mortgage, whether to give us a job, are taken by AI. And more and more of the\nideas, of the images, of the stories that surround\nus and shape our minds, our world are produced, are created by AI, not by human beings. - If you can just linger on that, what is the danger of that? That more and more of\nthe creative side is done by AI, the idea generation, is it that we become\nstale in our thinking? Is that that idea generation\nis so fundamental to like the evolution of humanity? - That we can't resist the ideas. To resist an idea, you need to have some vision\nof the creative process. - Yeah.\n- Now this is a very old fear. You go back to Plato's cave, so this idea this idea that\npeople are sitting chained in a cave and seeing shadows\non a screen, on a wall, and thinking this is reality. You go back to Descartes and he has this thought experiment of the demon. And Descartes asks himself, how do I know that any of this is real? Maybe there is a demon who is creating all of this and is basically\nenslaving me by surrounding me with these illusions. You go back to Buddha,\nit's the same question. What if we are living\nin a world of illusions, and because we have been living\nin it throughout our lives, all our ideas, all our desires,\nhow we understand ourself, this is all the product\nof the same illusions. And this was a big philosophical question for thousands of years. Now it's becoming a practical\nquestion of engineering, because previously all the\nideas, as far as we know, maybe we are living inside\na computer simulation of intelligent rats from the planet Zerco. If that's the case, we\ndon't know about it. But taking what we do know\nabout human history until now, all the, again, stories, images,\npaintings, songs, operas, theater, everything we've\nencountered and shaped our minds was created by humans. Now increasingly we live in\na world where more and more of these cultural artifacts will be coming from an alien intelligence. Very quickly we might\nreach a point when most of the story stories, images,\nsongs, TV shows, whatever, are created by an alien intelligence. And if we now find ourselves\ninside this kind of world of illusions, created\nby an alien intelligence that we don't understand,\nbut it understands us, this is a kind of, you know, spiritual enslavement that\nwe won't be able to break out of because it understands us, it understands how to manipulate us, but we don't understand\nwhat is behind this screen of stories and images and songs. - So if there's a set of AI\nsystems that are operating in the space of ideas that\nare far superior to ours and we're not almost able\nto, it's opaque to us, we're not able to see through, how does that change the\npursuit of happiness, the human pursuit of happiness? Life. Where do we get joy if we're surrounded by AI systems that are doing most of the cool things humans\ndo much better than us? - You know, some of the things, it's okay that the AIs will do them. Many human tasks and jobs, you know, they're drudgery, they are not fun, they are not developing us\nemotionally or spiritually. It's fine if the robots\ntake over. I dunno. I think about the people in\nsupermarkets or grocery stores that spend hours every day just, you know, passing items and charging you the money. I mean, if this can be\nautomated, wonderful. We need to make sure that\nthese people then have better jobs, better means\nof supporting themselves and developing their social abilities, their spiritual abilities. And that's the ideal\nworld that AI can create. That it takes away from\nus the things that, it's better if we don't do\nthem and allows us to focus on the most important things\nand the deepest aspects of our nature, of our potential. If we give AI control\nof the sphere of ideas, at this stage, I think it's very, very dangerous because\nit doesn't understand us. And AI at present is mostly\ndigesting the products of human culture. Everything we've produced\nover thousands of years, it eats all of these cultural products, digests it, and starts\nproducing its own new stuff. But we still haven't figured\nout ourselves, in our bodies, our brains, our minds, our psychology. So an AI-based on our\nflow and understanding of ourselves is a very dangerous thing. I think that we need, first of all, to keep developing ourselves. If for every dollar and\nevery minute that we spend on developing AI, artificial intelligence, we spend another dollar and another minute in developing human consciousness, the human mind will be okay. The danger is that we spent all our effort on developing an AI at\na time that we don't understand ourselves, and\nthen letting the AI take over, that's a road to a human catastrophe. - Does this surprise you how well large language models work?\n- Yes. - I mean, has it modified\nyour understanding of the nature of intelligence? - Yes. I mean, you know, I've\nbeen writing about AI for, I don't know, like eight years now. And engaged with all these\npredictions and speculations. And when it actually came, it was much faster and more\npowerful than I thought it would be. I didn't think that we would have in 2023 an AI that can hold the\nconversation that you can't know if it's a human\nbeing or an AI, that can write beautiful texts, I mean, I read the texts written\nby AI and the thing that strikes me most is the coherence. You know, people think, oh, it's nothing. They just takes ideas from\nhere and there words from, and put it, no, it's so coherent. I mean, you read in not sentences, you read paragraphs,\nyou read entire texts. And there is logic. - Yes.\n- There is a structure. - It's not only coherent, it's convincing. - Yes.\n- And the beautiful thing about it that has to do with your work, it doesn't have to be true\nand it often gets facts wrong, but it still is convincing, and it is both scary and beautiful. - Yes.\n- That our brains love language so much that we don't need the facts to be correct. - Yes.\n- We just need it to be a beautiful story.\n- Yeah. And that's been the secret of politics and religion for thousands of years. And now it's coming with AI. - So you, as a person who has written some of the most impactful words\never written, in your books, how does that make you\nfeel that you might be one of the last effective human writers? - That's a good question. - First of all, do you\nthink that's possible? - I think it is possible. I've seen a lot of\nexamples of AI being told, write like Yuval Noah\nHarari and what it produces. - Has it ever done better\nthan you think you could have written yourself? - I mean, on the level\nof content of ideas? No. There are things I say,\nI would never say that. But when it comes to the,\nyou know, I mean, there is, again, the coherence and\nthe quality of writing is such that I say, it's\nunbelievable how good it is. And who knows, in 10 years, in 20 years, maybe it can do better, even on, according to certain measures\nof, on the level of content. - So that people would be able\nto do like a style transfer, do in the style of Yuval\nNoah Harari write, anything. Write why I should have ice cream tonight. And make it convincing. - I don't know if I have\nanything convincing to say about these things. - I think you would be surprised. I think you'd be surprised. That could be an evolutionary biology explanation for why... - [Yuval Noah Harari] Yeah.\nIce cream is good for you. - Yeah. So, I mean that\nchanges the nature of writing. - Ultimately I think it goes back... Much of my writing is\nsuspicious of itself. I write stories about\nthe danger of stories. I write about intelligence, but highlighting the\ndangers of intelligence. Ultimately, I don't think that... In terms of power, human power comes from\nintelligence and from stories. But I think that the\ndeepest and best qualities of humans are not intelligence\nand not storytelling and not power. Again, with all our power,\nwith all our cooperation, with all our intelligence, we are on the verge of\ndestroying ourselves and destroying much of the ecosystem. Our best qualities are not there. Our best qualities are non-verbal. Again, they come from\nthings like compassion, from introspection, and introspection from my experience is not verbal. If you try to understand\nyourself with words, you will never succeed. There is a place where you need the words, but the deepest insights,\nthey don't come from words. And you can't write about it. But that's, again, it\ngoes back to Wittgenstein, to Buddha, to so many\nof these sages before, that these are the things\nwe are silent about. - Yeah. But eventually you have to\nproject it, as a writer, you have to do the silent introspection, but projected onto a page. - Yes. But you still have to warn people. You will never find the\ndeepest truth in a book. You will never find it in words. You can only find it in, I\nthink, in direct experience, which is nonverbal, which is preverbal. - In the silence of your own mind. - Yes.\n- Somewhere in there. - Yes.\n(Lex laughing) - Well, lemme ask you\na silly question then, a ridiculously big question. You have done a lot of deep\nthinking about the world, about yourself, this\nkind of introspection. How do you think, if\nyou, by way of advice, but just practically speaking, day to day, how do you think about difficult\nproblems with the world? - Mm. First of all, I take time off. Like my, the most important thing I do, I think as a writer, as\na scientist, I meditate. I spend about two hours every\nday in silent meditation, observing as much as\npossible, non-verbally, what is happening within\nmyself, focusing, you know, body sensations, the breath. Thoughts keep coming up, but I try not to give them attention. Don't try to drive them away. Just let them be there in the background, like some background noise. Don't engage with the thoughts, because the mind is constantly producing stories with words. These stories come\nbetween us and the world. They don't allow us to see\nourselves or the world. Like for me, the most shocking thing, when I started meditating\nlike 23 years ago, I was given the simple\nexercise to just observe my breath coming in and\nout of the nostrils, not controlling it, just observing it. And I couldn't do it for\nmore than 10 seconds. I, for 10 seconds would try to notice, oh, now the breath is coming\nin, it's coming in, it's coming in. Oh, it stopped coming in and\nnow it's going out, going out. 10 seconds, and some memory would come, some thought would come, some story about something that happened last week or 10 years\nago, or in the future. And the story would hijack my attention. It would take me maybe five\nminutes to remember, oh, I'm supposed to be observing my breath. If I can't observe my own breath because of these stories\ncreated by the mind, how can I hope to understand\nmuch more complex things, like the political situation in Israel, the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, the Russian invasion of Ukraine. If all these stories keep coming, I mean, it's not the truth, it's just the story your own mind created. So first thing, train\nthe mind to be silent and just observe. So two hours every day. And I go every year for a\nlong retreat between one month and two months, 60 days\nof just silent meditation. - [Lex Fridman] Silent\nmeditation for 60 days? - Yeah. To train the mind, forget\nabout your own stories, just observe what is really happening. And then also on other,\nthroughout the day, have an information diet. People are, today, many\npeople are very aware of what they feed their body,\nwhat enters their mouth. Be very aware of what you feed your mind, what enters your mind. Have an information diet. So for instance, I read long\nbooks, and I prefer, like, you know, I do many interviews. I prefer three hours interviews\nto five minutes interviews. The long format is in,\nit's not always feasible, but you can go much, much deeper. So I would say an information diet. Be very careful about\nwhat you feed your mind. Give preference to big\nchunks over small... - To books over Twitter. - Yes. Books over Twitter, definitely. And then, you know, when\nI encounter a problem, a difficult intellectual\nproblem, then I give it, I let the problem lead me where it goes and not where I want it to go. If I approach a problem\nwith some preconceived idea, solution, and then try to\nimpose it on the problem, and you know, just find confirmation bias. Just find the evidence\nthat supports my view. This is easy for the mind to do. And you don't learn anything new. - Do you take notes? Do you start to concretize\nyour thoughts on paper? - I read a lot. Usually I don't take notes.\nThen I start writing. And when I write, I write\nlike a torrent. Just write. Now it's the time, you read. You wanted meditation. Now it's the time to write,\nwrite, don't stop, just write. So I would write from\nmemory and I'm not afraid of formulating, say, big ideas, big theories and putting them on paper. The danger is once it's\non paper, not on paper, on the screen, in the computer,\nyou get attached to it. And then you start with\nconfirmation bias to build more and more layers around it. And you can't go back. And\nthen it's very dangerous. But I trust myself that\nI have to some extent the ability to press the delete button. The most important button\nin the keyboard is delete. - Yeah, yeah.\n- I write and then I delete. I write and then I delete. And because I trust\nmyself that I'll have the, every time I come to press\ndelete button, I feel bad. Like it's a kind of pain.\nHey, I created this. It's a beautiful idea\nand I have to delete it? - But you're still brave\nenough to press delete? - I try and hopefully\nI do it enough times. And this is important\nbecause in the long term, it enables me to play with ideas. I have the confidence to start\nformulating some brave idea. Most of them turn out to be nonsense. But I trust myself not to be attached, not to become attached to my own nonsense. So it gives me this room for playfulness. - I would be amiss if I didn't ask, for people interested in hearing\nyou talk about meditation, if they wanna start meditating, what advice would you\ngive on how to start? You mentioned you couldn't hold it for, you couldn't hold your\nattention on your breath for longer than 10 seconds.\n- Yes. - At first. So how do they\nstart on this journey? - First of all, it's a difficult journey. It's not fun, it's not recreational, it's not kind of time to relax. It can be very, very intense. The most difficult thing, at least in the meditation\nI practice, vipassana, which I learned from a\nteacher called S. N. Goenka, the most difficult thing\nis not the silence, it's not the sitting for long hours. It's what comes up. Everything you don't want\nto know about yourself. - Yeah.\n- This is what comes up. So it's very intense and difficult. If you go to a meditation retreat, don't think you're going to relax. - So what's the experience\nof a meditation retreat when everything you don't\nlike comes up for 30 days? - It depends what comes\nup. Anger comes up. You are angry.\n- Yeah. - For days on end, you're\njust boiling with anger. Everything makes you angry. Again, something that happens right now or you remember something\nfrom 20 years ago and you start boiling with, it's like, I never even thought about this incident, but it's somewhere, it\nwas somewhere stored with a huge, huge pile\nof anger attached to it. And it's now coming up and\nall the anger is coming up. Maybe it's boredom. You know, 30 days of meditation,\nyou start getting bored, and it's the most boring thing in... Suddenly no anger, no,\nit's the most boring... Another second and I scream. I mean, and boredom is one\nof the most difficult thing to deal with in life. I think it's closely related\nto death. Death is boring. You know, in many movies\ndeath is exciting. It's not exciting. When you die, it's,\nultimately, it's boredom. Nothing happens. - It's the end of exciting things. - And many things in the world\nhappened because of boredom. To some extent people start\nentire wars because of boredom. People quit relationships,\npeople quit jobs because of boredom. And if you never learn\nhow to deal with boredom, you will never learn how\nto enjoy peace and quiet. Because the way to peace\npasses through boredom. And from what I experienced\nwith meditation, I think, maybe it was the most difficult, maybe at least in the top three, like much more difficult\nsay than anger, or pain. When pain comes up, you feel heroic. Hey, I'm dealing with pain. When boredom comes up,\nit brings it, you know, with depression and\nfeelings of worthlessness. And it's nothing, I'm nothing. - The way to peace is through boredom. David Foster Wallace said the key to life is to be unborable. - Which is a different perspective on what you're talking to. Is there truth to that? - Yes. I mean, it is closely related. I would say... Like I look at the world\ntoday, like politics. The one thing we need\nmore than anything else is boring politicians. We have a super abundance\nof very exciting politicians who are doing and saying\nvery exciting things. And we need boring politicians.\nAnd we need them quickly. - And yeah, the way to\npeace is through boredom. That applies in more ways than one. What advice would you\ngive to young people today in high school and college? How to have a successful life? How to have a successful career? - What they should know it's\nthe first time in history nobody has any idea how the world would look like in 10 years. - Yeah.\n- Nobody has any idea how the world would look\nlike when you grow up. You know, throughout history, it was never possible\nto predict the future. You live in the Middle Ages, nobody knows maybe in 10\nyears the Vikings will invade, the Mongols will invade,\nthere'll be an epidemic, there'll be an earthquake, who knows? But the basic structures\nof life will not change. Most people will still be peasants. Armies would fight on\nhorseback with swords and bows and arrows and things like that. So you could learn a lot from\nthe wisdom of your elders, they've been there before, and they knew what kind of\nbasic skills you need to learn. Most people need to learn how to sow wheat and harvest wheat or rice\nand make bread and build a house and ride a horse\nand things like that. Now we have no idea,\nnot just about politics. We have no idea how the\njob market would look like in 10 years. We have no ideas, no idea what\nskills will still be needed. You think you are going\nto learn how to code because there'll need a\nlot of coders in the 2030s? Think again. Maybe AI\nis doing all the coding. You don't need any coders. You are going to, I don't know, you learn to translate languages. You wanna be a translator? Gone. We don't know what skills will be needed. So the most important\nskill is the skill to keep learning and keep changing\nthroughout our lives, which is very, very difficult. To keep reinventing ourselves. It's a deep, again, it's in\na way a spiritual practice. To build your personality. To build your mind as\na very flexible mind. If traditionally people\nthought about education, like building a stone house\nwith very deep foundations, now it's more like setting\nup a tent that you can fold and move to the next\nplace very, very quickly. 'Cause that's the 21st century. - Which also raises questions about the future of education. What that looks like. - Yeah.\n- Let me ask you about love. What were some of the challenges? What were some of the lessons about love, about life that you learn\nfrom coming out as gay? - In many ways it goes\nback to the stories. I think this is one of\nthe reasons I became so interested in stories\nand in their power, was I grew up in a small\nIsraeli town in the 1980s, early 1990s, which was very homophobic. And I basically embraced\nit. I breathed it. Because you could hardly\neven think differently. So you had these two\npowerful stories around, one, that God hates gay people\nand that he will punish them for who they are or for what they do. Secondly, that it's not God, it's nature. That there is something\ndiseased or sick about it. And these people, maybe\nthey're not sinners, but they are sick, they are defective. And nobody wanted to\nidentify with such a thing. If your options, okay,\nyou can be a sinner, you can be a defect, but what do you want? No good options there. And it took me many years\ntill I was 21 to come to term with it. And one of the things,\nI learned two things, first about the amazing\ncapacity of the human mind for denial and delusion\nthat an algorithm could have told me that I'm gay\nwhen I was like 14 or 15. Like if there is a good\nlooking guy and girl walking, I would immediately focus on the guy. But I didn't connect the dots. Like I could not understand\nwhat was happening inside my own brain and my own\nmind and my own body. Took me a long time to realize,\nyou know, you are just gay. - So that speaks to the\npower of social convention versus individual thought. - It's virtually this is the\npower of self delusion that, you know, it's not that I knew\nI was gay and was hiding it. I was hiding it from myself successfully. That I don't understand how\nit is possible, looking back, I don't understand how it is possible, but I know it is possible. I knew and didn't know at the same time. And then the other big lesson\nis the power of the stories, of the social conventions. Because the stories were not true. They did not make sense\neven on their own terms. Even if you accept the\nbasic religious framework of the world, that there is a good God that created everything\nand controls everything. Why would a good God\npunish people for love? I understand why a good\nGod would punish people for violence, for hatred, for cruelty. But why would God punish people for love, especially when he created them that way? So even if you accept\nthe religious framework of the world, obviously\nthe story that God hates gay people, it comes not\nfrom God, but from some humans who invented this story. They take their own hatred. This is something humans do all the time. They hate somebody and they\nsay, no, I don't hate them. God hates them. They throw\ntheir own hatred on God. And then if you think about\nthe scientific framework that said that, oh, gays,\nthey are against nature. They are against the laws of nature. They're, and so forth. Science tells us nothing can exist against the laws of nature. Things that go against the laws\nof nature just don't exist. There is a law of nature\nthat you can't move faster than the speed of light. Now you don't have this\nminority of people who break the laws of nature by going\nfaster than the speed of light. And then nature comes, nah, that's bad. You shouldn't do that.\nThat's not how nature works. If something goes against\nthe laws of nature, it just can't exist. The fact that gay people\nexist me, and not just people. You see homosexuality among many, many mammals and birds and other animals. It exists because it is in\nline with the laws of nature. The idea that this is sick,\nthat this is whatever, it comes not from nature, it comes from the human imagination. Some people, or for whatever\nreasons, hated gay people. They said, oh, they go against nature. But this is a story created by people. This is not the laws of nature. And this taught me that\nso many of the things that we think are natural\nor eternal or divine, no, they're just human stories. But these human stories\nare often the most powerful forces in the world. - So what did you learn from your, just a personal struggle of journey through the social conventions to find one of the things that makes\nlife awesome, which is love? So like what it takes to kinda strip away the self delusion and the pressures of social convention, to wake up. - It takes a lot of work, a lot of courage and a lot\nof help from other people. This kind of, again, heroic idea, I can do it all by\nmyself, it doesn't work. Certainly with love, you need\nat least one more person. And I'm very happy that I found Itzik. We lived in the same small Israeli town. We lived on two adjacent\nstreets for years. Probably went to school\non the same bus for years without really encountering each other. In the end, we met on one\nof the first dating sites on the internet for gay\npeople in Israel in 2002. - You're saying the internet works? - Yes. And I said-\n- For love? - Bad things or dangers about\ntechnology and the internet. And there are also, of\ncourse, good things. And this is not an accident. You have two kinds of\nminorities in history. You have minorities which are\na cohesive group like Jews, that yes, you're a small,\nbeing born Jewish in, say, Germany or Russia or whatever. You are born in a small community. But as a Jewish boy, you\nare born to a Jewish family. You have Jewish parents,\nyou have Jewish siblings, you are in a Jewish neighborhood,\nyou have Jewish friends. So these kinds of minorities, they could always come\ntogether and help each other throughout history. Now, another type of minority, like gay people or more\nbroadly LGBTQ people, that as a gay boy, you are usually not born\nto a gay family with gay parents and gay siblings\nin a gay neighborhood. So usually you find\nyourself completely alone. For most of history, one of the biggest problems\nfor the gay community was that there was no community. How do you find one another? And the internet was a wonderful thing in this respect because\nit made it very easy for these kinds of diffused communities, so diffused minorities to find each other. So me and Itzik, even though we rode the\nsame bus together to school for years, we didn't meet\nin the physical world, we met online, because\nagain, in the physical world, you don't want to identify, in a Israeli town in the\n1980s, you ride the bus, you don't want to say, \"Hey, I'm gay, is there anybody else gay here?\" That's not a good idea. But on the internet we\ncould find each other. - There's another lesson in\nthere that maybe sometimes the thing you're looking for\nis right under your nose. - Yeah. A very old lesson and a very\ntrue lesson in many ways. So you need help from\nother people to realize the truth about yourself. So of course, in love, you\ncannot just love abstractly. There is another person\nthere, you need to find them. But also, you know, we were one of the first\ngenerations who enjoy the benefits of gay liberation, of the very difficult\nstruggles of people who are much braver than us in\nthe 1980s, 1970s, 1960s, who dared to question social conventions, to struggle at sometimes a terrible price. And we benefited from it. And more broadly, we spoke earlier about the feminist movement. There would've been no gay liberation without the feminist movement. We also owe them a for, you know, starting to change the gender\nstructure of the world. And this is always true. You can never do it just by yourself. Also, I look at my journey in meditation. I could not have found... I mean, the idea of going\nto meditation retreat. Okay. But I couldn't discover meditation by, I couldn't develop the\nmeditation technique by myself. Somebody had to teach me this way of how to look inside yourself. And it's also a very important\nlesson that you can't do it just by yourself. That this fantasy of complete autonomy, of complete self-sufficiency,\nit doesn't work. You hear, it tends to be a very\nkind of male macho fantasy. I don't need anybody. I can be so strong and\nso brave that I'll do everything by myself. It never works. - You need friends, you need a mentor. You need the very thing\nthat makes us human is other humans.\n- Absolutely. - You mentioned that the\nfear of boredom might be a kind of proxy for the fear of death. So what role does the fear of death play in the human condition? Are you afraid of death? - Yes. I think everybody\nare afraid of death. I mean, all our fears come\nout of the fear of death, but the fear of death is\njust so deep and difficult. We can't, usually we\ncan't face it directly. So we cut it into little\npieces and we face just little pieces. Oh, I lost my smartphone. That's a little, little, little\npiece of the fear of death, which is of losing everything. So I can't deal with losing everything, I'm dealing now with\nlosing my phone or losing a book or whatever. Somebody, I feel pain... That's a small bit of the fear of death. Somebody who really doesn't fear death, would not fear anything at all. There will be like anything that happens, I can deal with it. If I can deal with death, this is nothing. - So any fears is a\ndistant echo of the big fear of death? Have you ever looked at it\nhead on, caught glimpses, sort of contemplated as the stoics do? - Yes. I mean, and when I was a teenager, I would constantly contemplate\nit, trying to understand, to imagine, it was a very, very shocking and moving experience. I remember, especially in\nconnection, like with, you know, with national ideology, which\nwas also very big strong in Israel, still is. Which again comes from the fear of death. You know that you're going to die. So you said, okay, I die,\nbut the nation lives on, I live on through the\nnation, I don't really die. And you hear it, especially on Memorial Day,\nday for fallen soldiers. So every day they'll be in school Memorial Day for fallen\nsoldiers who fell defending Israel in all its different wars. And all these kids would\ncome dressed in white. And you have this big\nceremony with flags and songs and dances in memory\nof the fallen soldiers. And you get the impression, again, I don't want it to sound crass, but you got the impression\nthat the best thing in life is to be a fallen soldier. Because even then, yes, you\ndie, everybody dies in the end. But then you'll have all\nthese school kids for years and years remembering you and celebrating you and you don't really die. And I remember standing in\nthese ceremonies and thinking, what does it actually mean? Like, okay, so if I'm a fallen\nsoldier, now I'm a skeleton. I'm bones under this, in\nthis military cemetery, under this stone. Do I actually hear the kids singing all these patriotic songs? If not, how do I know they\ndo it? Maybe they trick me. Maybe I die in the war and\nthen they don't sing any songs. And how does it help me? And I realized, I was\nquite young at the time, that if you are dead, you can't\nhear anything because you, that's the meaning of being dead. And if you're dead, you\ncan't think of anything. Like, oh, now they're\nremembering... Because you are dead. That's the meaning of being dead. And it was a shocking realization. - But it's a really\ndifficult realization to keep holding in your mind. Like it's the end.\n- I lost it over time. I mean, for many years, it was a very powerful fuel, motivation for philosophical, for\nspiritual exploration. And I realized that the\nfear of death is really a very powerful drive. And over the years,\nespecially as I meditated, it kind of dissipated, and today sometimes I find\nmyself trying to recapture this teenage fear of death\nbecause it was so powerful. And I just can't. I try\nto make the same image. I don't know. It's... - There's something\nabout the teenage years. - Yeah, I always thought that the adults, there is something wrong with the adults. - Yeah.\n- Because they don't get it. - Yeah. Like I would ask my parents\nor teachers about it and they, oh yes, you die in the end. That's it. But, and on the other hand, they're so worried about other things. - Yeah.\n- Like there'll be a political crisis or an economic problem or a personal problem, like\nwith the bank or whatever. They'll be so worried. But then about the fact that\nthey're going to die, ah, we don't care about it. - That's why you read Camus and others when you're a teenager, you really worry about\nthe existential questions. Well, this feels like\nthe right time to ask the big question. What's the meaning of\nthis whole thing, Yuval? And you're the right person to ask, what's the meaning of life? - Meaning of life?\n- Yes. - Oh, that's easy.\n- What is it? (both laughing) - So what life is, if you\nask what the meaning of life, what life is, life is feeling\nthings, having sensations, emotions, and reacting to them. When you feel something\ngood, something pleasant, you want more out of\nit, you want more of it. When you feel something unpleasant, you want to get rid of it. That's the whole of life. That's what is happening all the time. You feel things, you want the\npleasant things to increase. You want the unpleasant\nthings to disappear. That what life is. If you ask what is the\nmeaning of life in a more kind of philosophical or spiritual question, the real question to ask what\nkind of answer do you expect? Most people expect a story. And that's always the wrong answer. Most people expect that\nthe answer to the question that what is the meaning\nof life will be a story, like a big drama, that this is the plot\nline and this is your role in the story. This is what you have to do. This is your line in the big play. You say your line, you do your\nthing... That's the thing. And this is human\nimagination. This is fantasy. To really understand\nlife, life is not a story. The universe does not\nfunction like a story. So I think to really understand life, you need to observe it\ndirectly in a nonverbal way. Don't turn it into a story. And the question to start\nwith is what is suffering? What is causing suffering? You know, the question,\nwhat is the meaning of life? It'll take you to fantasies and delusions. We want to stay with the reality of life. And the most important\nquestion about the reality of life is what is suffering\nand where is it coming from? - And to answer that non-verbally, so the conscious experience of suffering. - Yes. When you suffer, try to\nobserve what is really happening when you are suffering. - Well put. And I wonder if AI will also\ngo through that same kind of process, on its way- - And if we develop consciousness or not, at present, it's not, it's just words. - It will just say to you,\n\"Please don't hurt me, Yuval\" (both laughing) Again, as I've mentioned to\nyou, I'm a huge fan of yours. Thank you for the incredible work you do. This conversation's been a\nlong time, I think, coming. It's a huge honor to talk\nto you. This is really fun. Thank you for talking today. - Thank you. I really enjoyed it. And as I said, I think the\nlong form is the best form. - (laughs) Yeah. I loved it. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Yuval Noah Harari. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Yuval Noah Harari himself. \"How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such\nas Christianity, democracy, or capitalism? First, you never admit that\nthe order is imagined.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
