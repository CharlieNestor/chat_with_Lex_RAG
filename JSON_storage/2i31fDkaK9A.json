      "text": "- I tweet that and then I finish the day and I wake up the next morning\nand I glance at my phone. I'm seeing all these verified\naccounts that are, you know, quote tweeting it, and demanding\na retraction and whatever. And I go, uh oh, okay, this looks like it's\ngetting some attention. I then continue about my day. Around noon, I hear from my\ndad that he got 100 messages, from, \"You should have aborted your son\", to, \"We're gonna find all\nof you\", to whatever else. My dad has no idea what's going on. He's like, I don't know what this is, but I have 100 DMs to\neverything else you can imagine. And I start to get emails about, you know, your Jewish faith, this and\nthat and the other thing. And so at that point, to me, I thought, this is just going to get\nworse and worse and worse. And so I deleted the tweet. And I really regret doing that, because over the 48 hours that followed, yes, the attacks escalated, it went through Candace Owens\nand then at foxnews.com, Newsmax, kind of peaking\nwith, with Donald Trump Jr. And it was horrible. The following is a\nconversation with David Pakman, a left wing, progressive\npolitical commentator and host of the David Pakman Show. I hope to continue to have\nmany conversations on politics with prominent, insightful, and sometimes controversial figures across the political spectrum. David and I have been planning\nto speak for a long time, and I'm sure we'll speak many more times. This conversation was\nchallenging, eye-opening and fun. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's David Pakman. Are there interesting differences to you between terms like Liberal,\nDemocrat, left wing, leftist, progressive, socialist,\ncommunist, Marxist, far left, center left, all of these labels? Is there interesting\ndistinctions between them? - Yeah, there's two sets of distinctions. One is if you just want to say, let's define each of\nthese as political terms. They're all different terms. You can be a progressive ideologically but not be a member of\nthe Democratic Party. Many say the Democratic Party isn't even really very progressive. So these are certainly\nterms that we could define in order to have a conversation\nabout the next thing, kind of as a precursor to a conversation. Sometimes the terms are\nused in order to tag someone with a certain ideology that's not really linked to policy or any particular political question, but they can be used\npositively or negatively to just kind of say, here is the image of this\nindividual that I have in my mind. So like Marxist is right now\nvery popularly being used by some on the right to attack Democrats. There's very few actual Marxists, certainly not in positions of\npower in the United States, but even among the general population. So I think it's important to distinguish, are we defining these terms because we want to compare\nand contrast the ideas that a particular group might\nbring to the discussion, or are we using them as insults\nor to stifle conversation? There are terms that can be used to start conversation or to stop it. - And the use of those terms is evolving rapidly month by month. So the term leftist, I think is a relatively popular term now to use in the negative context to describe what an outraged left wing commentator. - I think what you're\nkind of grasping onto is that there's probably some set of ideas that would apply to most of those who consider themselves to be on the left. The discussion of how that\nterm is mostly being used is not about policy ideas. You're accurately kind\nof identifying that. And it does seem like progressive is no longer being used as a smear, and leftist is being used as\na smear more at this point. - Okay, but sometimes some\nof these terms are useful, like can we try to pick\nthe terms that are useful, like Liberal and progressive and Democrat. Liberal and progressive, is there an interesting\ndefinable distinction between Liberal and progressive to you? - That's a maybe one of\nthe most interesting ones. 10 years ago Liberal often meant what now we mean by progressive. More recently, the progressive\nsocialist leaning part of the political spectrum has started to use\nLiberal to mean Joe Biden, to mean someone who is\nnot really left enough. So Liberal's very interesting because I remember talking\nwith my audience years ago, maybe eight years ago\nor something like that, where I identified I'm going to now use the term progressive more commonly to describe my own beliefs, because Liberal has now been made a smear. It's being shifted into something else. And it also means more of\nlike a center left politics. So it's changed in some\nsense by necessity, by force. And also because the spectrum\nhas shifted to some degree. - So the term Liberal has evolved, now Liberal meaning\nsome kind of embodiment of the mainstream Democratic Party almost. - To some degree. Sometimes I'm called, I'm\nwritten off by, you know, within my space, there are\nall sorts of shades of gray, which I'm sure we can talk about, about where I am, versus should be, could be, or am wrongly placed. And sometimes an attack\non me is, he's just a Lib, meaning I'm not left enough,\nI'm not progressive, socialist, wherever else you want to go. So yeah, the problem with\na lot of these terms, and they're used very casually by people who call into my show, is that unless we actually\ndefine them each time, they very often mean very different things to different people, and often come with an\nagenda attached to them. And so I find that they often\nstifle meaningful conversation rather than encourage it. - Hey, do you sense\nthat there's a drifting of what is the threshold\nto be a progressive? Or is there, should we use\nprogressive synonymously with Democratic socialists? - I think we should\nnot use it synonymously with Democratic socialists. And this is where there's\nanother linguistic confusion and a political confusion. So we'll first talk\nabout the linguistic one. Social democracy versus\nDemocratic socialism. Very similar words in a\ndifferent order, okay? The way I operate is Democratic socialism is actually a form of socialism where one would seek\nto socialize ownership of the means of production as an example. Social democracy is a\nvery highly regulated form of capitalism, the likes of which we would see in Northern Europe, Denmark, et cetera. These are very different things. I associate progressivism in\n2023 with social democracy and would consider Democratic socialism a form of actual socialism. That is different. We're no longer talking about\na capitalist organization of society. - So transition from one to the other is a fundamental shift in\nhow society operates then? - Absolutely. And when you talk about social democracy, you're talking about\nsocializing a couple more things than we socialize in most\nmodern capitalist countries. I had this conversation with\nPatrick Bet-David recently. Social democracy is, okay, we've socialized\nthe military already in the United States. We've socialized some\nhealthcare in the sense of like the VA and Medicaid, et cetera. We're talking about socializing\na couple more things still in a capitalist country. Democratic socialism would\nbe something beyond that. And as someone who is not a\nDemocratic socialist myself, I'm maybe not the best\nadvocate for explaining exactly how that system would function, but it would have some version\nof socializing ownership of the means of production\nbusinesses, et cetera. - So you mentioned you\nappeared on the PBD podcast with Patrick Bet-David. The debate was pretty intense. - [David] Was it? - I should say, I personally enjoyed it. I thought actually you did well, and I thought Patrick did well, and it was a good conversation. There was a little bit of tension. - [David] Yeah. - And I thought that Patrick actually, so I disagreed with the internet. I thought Patrick just took\non a kind of devil's advocate. Like he was purposely being stubborn to bring out the best in you. But the internet thought\nthat he's being stubborn, not being open to your ideas. I thought the tension between ideas, I think a lot of the tension had to do probably with Donald\nTrump and Trump supporters. - That certainly could be the case. And people wrote to me the full gamut of everything you can imagine, from this was your best thing\nyou've ever done in public, to you got humiliated and your mother should have aborted you. Okay, so and everything in between. So, you know, take your pick. But the most interesting feedback I got was from people who asked me, after, was it incredibly\ntense and awkward, and because it seemed so combative. And I think for, I'm so used\nto those types of tensions in the discussions that I have that it's very comfortable to me. It's not like afterwards it's, there's a grudge or it's tense\nor whatever the case may be. I'm very comfortable just, I disagree with people and that's it. So I did not find anything\nthat happened inappropriate. I disagreed with a lot of the\nthings he said, certainly. - So you also spoken with Michael Knowles, I think about the idea of what is a woman. Can you speak broadly\nabout your conversations with people you disagree with? You know, some of the cases\nit feels like it's gone wrong. - The conversations have gone wrong. - [Lex] Yeah. - Yeah, I mean, I think there's\na couple different things. And I'm the first to tell you that depending on who I'm talking to, I go in with a different attitude about how, quote, seriously I'm taking it in the sense of whether\nI think it's going to be a deep policy discussion, versus whether it's going\nto be more of a performance for an audience that is\nexpecting a certain thing. And I think there's\ndifferent types of shows. When I was interviewed by this guy, Jesse Lee Peterson in Los Angeles, it's very different, for example, than when I'm talking\nto Patrick Bet-David, just to give two examples. I think the reason I stopped\ndoing the Michael Knowles Show was the number of of threats\nI would get after the fact. That's really the, I was\nglad to engage with him to the extent that the\ninterviews were interesting and, you know, we could organize\nit reasonably efficiently. But the reason I stepped away\nwas sort of the aftermath. But I did find him to be\nsomeone who was abundantly clear about his view and where he comes from. And while I could not possibly\ndisagree more with him in terms of politics and\nculture and our backgrounds, everything is just so different. I found it easy to engage\nin the conversation just because of how\nupfront and clear he was about what his beliefs were. - But the number of\nthreats, it's too much. - Yeah, it was just too much. And this, you know, I don't\nknow if how much you saw about this recent Twitter\ndust up I was involved in that peaked with Donald\nTrump Jr. tweeting about me, and then that then declining from there. - Oh, let's talk through\nit, I didn't see it. - Okay. - I have to understand, like\nthe way you study Shakespeare, I have to study your Twitter. I have to understand how\nmuch of it is sarcasm, how much-- - It's mostly sarcasm. I mean here's the thing, and I know that there\nare people who will say, David, you're dealing\nwith such serious issues, it's really not okay not to take everything you\ndo completely seriously. But my view is, it's so\nincredible that I've, between chance and timing\nand so different things fallen into a position where this is what I do professionally, and it's a career, and it's\nfinancially sustainable and all these different things. I don't wanna end up\ntaking myself too seriously because I recognize the timing and luck and all of these other things. And this could have gone a\ncompletely different way. So my approach to a lot of this is let's not take ourselves too seriously, and in particular on\nTwitter, a platform that, you know, the degree to which it should be taken very seriously maybe\nhas changed over time. I'm always sort of thinking\na little bit tongue in cheek on Twitter. - So what happened with Donald Trump Jr.? - [David] So. - Or the full arc of it. - Yeah, to give you a one minute arc and then we can pick\nwhichever parts we want. After a mass shooting, now you might say there's\nlike two or three a day, you're correct. After the Nashville mass\nshooting at a Christian school, I tweeted snarkily, tongue in cheek, to point that thoughts and prayers not only aren't particularly\nuseful after a shooting, they also don't prevent shootings. That there's some confusion about how there would be a\nshooting at a Christian school given that it is a place\nwhere prayer is taking place. I think, you know, jokingly\nsaid something like, were they not praying enough or correctly? - In my deep journalistic integrity. - You have it. - I have your tweet. - [David] Beautiful, beautiful. - This is the only display\nof journalistic integrity I will show today. Okay, and then I have\na couple of responses. - [David] Beautiful. - And you deleted the tweet since then. - Which I regret. - Oh, interesting. - [David] And we can talk about that. - Well I would love to because it's such a interesting decision, because when you tweet something, one of the things I've also learned is you don't often understand\nhow it's going to be read. It's going to be analyzed,\nlike I mentioned, Shakespeare. Like there's certain, the use of certain words\nthat you regret saying in a certain kind of way, maybe just 'cause it wasn't\nas eloquent, as powerful. It didn't actually convey the thing, or is the distraction to the main message, all that kind of stuff. Okay, the actual tweet is, \"Very surprising that there\nwould be a mass shooting at a Christian school, \"given that lack of prayer is often blamed \"for these horrible events. \"Is it possible they weren't\npraying enough or correctly \"despite being a Christian school?\" And a lot of people quote retweeted that, which I'm assuming was criticism. So Colin Wright wrote, \"I used to consider you\na reasonable progressive, \"but you clearly devolved\ninto partisan hackery. \"I'm an atheist. \"It cannot begin to fathom \"using the murder of children and adults \"at a Christian school as an opportunity \"to dunk on the concept of prayer.\" And you responded, \"I'm dunking on the people\nwho send thoughts and prayers \"and do nothing else, and\nthe shootings continue.\" Okay, I'm sure there's a\nlot of other interactions with this. - There's a few other a\nhundred thousand interactions. So do you want the arc\nleading to the deleting of it? - [Lex] Yes, please. - So basically-- - [Lex] I just wanted to display-- - Do you know what time of day\nI tweeted the original one? I feel like it was in the\nafternoon or evening on a Monday. - 3:42 PM on 27th, March 27th. - Which was a Monday, okay. So basically I tweet that\nand then I finish the day. - So you tweet, and then\nyou go on with your day. - I might have looked once at Twitter, and it had 2,000 likes\nand a few people saying, eh, this might have missed the mark. But it's sort of like, it's\none of my 20,000 tweets, I don't know. I wake up the next morning, my baby daughter did not sleep till 7:30 the way I would like, so she's up at 6:00 AM, and I get up, and I'm just there\nstarting to make breakfast. And I glance at my phone,\nand I'm starting to, this was when verified\nmeant a different thing than it means now. I'm seeing all these\nverified accounts that are, you know, quote tweeting it, and demanding a retraction and whatever. And I go, uh oh, okay, this\nlooks like it's getting, looks like it's getting some attention. I then continue about my day. Around noon, I hear from my\ndad that he got 100 messages from, \"you should have aborted your son\", to, \"we're gonna find all\nof you\", to whatever else. My dad has no idea what's going on. He's like, I don't know what this is, but I have 100 DMs, to\neverything else you can imagine. And I start to get emails about, you know, your Jewish faith, this and\nthat, and the other thing. And so at that point to me, I thought, this is just going to get\nworse and worse and worse. And so I deleted the tweet. And I really regret doing that. Because over the 48 hours that followed, yes the attacks escalated, it\nwent through Candace Owens, and then at foxnews.com, Newsmax, kind of peaking with Donald Trump Jr. And it was horrible. I mean thousands and\nthousands of the, okay. But once I told my audience\nabout what happened, I got thousands of messages\nfrom people saying, David, only someone who doesn't know you and is determined to interpret this in the worst possible faith would think you're blaming\nkids who died for getting shot. Of course you weren't doing that, I wish you hadn't deleted it,\nso that it would still be up and you would now see the\ntide kind of turning on it. This was not a fun three days regardless, but I do regret having\ndeleted it because it was a- I wanted to do the quickest\nthing I thought I could to get people to stop trying\nto find family members and send them threats. And so around noon, that's what I did. And the truth is the\nthreats didn't stop anyway, 'cause everybody had screenshotted it. And I do wish I had left it up. - And is there some degree,\nmaybe stepping outside yourself, do you regret tweeting that, in that it feeds the mockery\nengine that fuels Twitter? So like, does that tweet really\nrepresent what you believe? - It absolutely represents\nthe disgust with politics that includes saying we can't\ntouch guns, we just, we can't. But we're willing to\npoint to mental health, or say we need more prayer\nin schools or whatever. 1000% it represents that view. Is it the type of snark and\nsarcasm that I would use if given an hour to discuss the topic rather than whatever\nthe number of characters is now on Twitter? No, definitely not. And so I am very cognizant of the fact that it was unnecessarily\nprovocative how it was written. - I think I asked similar\nquestion to Ben Shapiro. Do you worry that this\nstyle of presentation can turn you from being, you\nknow, a deeply thoughtful, objective political thinker, to somebody who is just a partisan hack? Or partisan, what's a\ngood word, talking head? - Do you mean with regard to Twitter, or the format of my show in general? - So Twitter for now, let's\nstart with Twitter for now. And can you silo your style\nof communication on Twitter from being a virus that affects your mind? - Right. I don't have deep thoughts\nabout the Twitter component, beyond, I think across\nall sorts of disciplines, this is not the best way to\nmost effectively solve problems and figure out solutions\nto complex issues. - [Lex] You're talking about Twitter? - Now, right now I'm\ntalking about Twitter. That being said, I think all of us to some\ndegree have to adapt our content to the platform that we're using, in the same way that\nwhat I post to YouTube is different than what I post to TikTok. What I post to Twitter is also different. Do I think Twitter has been an\nunmitigated good for society? No. Have I chosen to step into Twitter as one of the ways in\nwhich I get my message out with the good and the bad? Yes. And I think that there\nis a deep conversation to be had there. I think zooming out a little\nbit in terms of what I do, and I was hoping this would come up because I think it's really interesting. I will often get emails from\npeople who say two things. I will get the, you would\nhave such a bigger audience if you did X type emails. And usually they are\nplays to sensationalism, salacious and titillating content, more pop culture stuff, et cetera. On the other hand, it's folks who say, listen, what you're doing\nreally isn't as serious as it could be, and it seems like you could\ndo something more serious, and you should consider doing deep dives. You know, once it was, do a deep dive into Calvin Coolidge, and I was like, nobody will watch that. So it's not by accident that my show is the way it is, right? In an hour, I'm thinking of\nall the platforms I'm on, and I'm saying, okay, I wanna\ndo a relatively deep dive on the federal budget, and I want to talk about some of the political tomfoolery going on within the post office. And I'm gonna do a segment\nabout the wacky rally where Trump said crazy things and made up three words and\nsaid he endorsed a candidate who's named it, right? I'm crafting that in\ntotal to find a balance between let's build this\naudience as much as I can in order to have a bigger base,\nto get my message out there, and include the more serious stuff with the hope that there's a little bit of something for everyone, and I'm finding a balance between those two sides of the spectrum. It's a deliberate thing. And I'm aware that if I were\nproducing my show 50 years ago, the balance would probably be different, and it would probably change again. If we didn't, if the show was audio only, rather than having all\nthese video platforms, it would also be different. But it's a decision\nthat's proactively made to try to get the best\nand most out of the hour that I'm creating every day. - Well it just feels like\nthere's an entire machine fed by Twitter and journalism\nthat wants to divide people. And the drama of that division, highlighting the partisan division, the drama of that division\nfeels like it's a tension with objective, clear thinking sometimes. And so that's the, I worry\nthat there's a drug to it. There's too much fun to\nmock ridiculous people on the other side. - I think you're right about that. And the fact that that is true, to me supports, I've talked\nwith my audience about, you know, like the old food pyramid, which I guess was like wrong, but let's imagine that there\nwas a pyramid that made sense. - [Lex] What's at the bottom, bread? - I think like whole grains maybe? I don't remember, it's been a while-- - Sugar is on the top. - Junk food is at the very top. I'm very open with my audience. The vast majority of what I\ndo is the top of that pyramid. And I tell people very openly, I don't consume a lot of the\ntype of content I produce. And I think it's really important to, as a base, be doing critical\nthinking, epistemology, how do we believe the things we believe, basics about the world. After that, reading history,\neconomics, philosophy, et cetera. After that, now we're\ngetting into current events. I would mostly be looking at consuming primary source reporting, things like Associated Press, whatever. I know everybody will\nhave a different list of what counts there. After that is when I'd say indulge in some of the commentary\ntype stuff that I do, if you find that I'm thoughtful\nenough to make it into that. But I'm very open and\nreally what I try to do on my show often is in being that at\nthe top of the pyramid, tell people there's all this other stuff that should be forming your foundation, that I hope you're consuming in addition to just watching me. And I'm very open with\nmy audience about that. - What about the shape, the dynamics, the characteristics of your audience? Is there some degree to which\nyou're, through mocking, maybe Republicans, that there's\na lean to that audience, and then you become\ncaptured by the audience? Do you worry about the audience capture? - I worry about it. I'm relatively comfortable that\nit's not shaping the program to a great degree in the sense that at this point, I have a pretty good sense\nof the things I can say that will upset what I\nmight call my core audience. You know, one of the interesting things, just to briefly go back\nto the Twitter thing was, those people who were\nfurious with me on Twitter, and they contacted my advertisers, and some advertisers dropped\nme, and on and on and on. None of them are actually in my audience. None of them are regular\nconsumers of my audience. They were kind of weaponized against me by people who said, hey, look at this. The people who follow\nCandace Owens on Twitter, other than for their kind of shock value, they're not in my audience. And with my core audience, I know there are things I can talk about that will generate displeasure, I guess you could say with my audience. Sometimes when I touch the\nIsraeli Palestinian conflict, that will happen. Sometimes on vaccines, there's\na portion of my audience that is more generally\nskeptical of vaccines. Sometimes on some foreign\npolicy issues, or you know, I'm not a big fan of Marianne Williamson nor Bobby Kennedy Jr's\nchallenges to Joe Biden, not because I love Joe Biden, but because I don't consider them to be the most serious challengers. I know there's people I know my audience who don't like that, they\nget mad at me about that. And I'm totally okay with that, and that tension with my core audience. So in that sense, I don't feel as though I've\nhad that audience capture take place, but I know it can happen, and I'm very open to to being told ways in which it may be happening\nwithout me noticing. - So I've made a call\nfor questions on Reddit for this conversation. There's a lot of good questions\nthat I'll probably bring up, but one of them was about\nMarianne Williamson, asking why David thinks\nshe's a garbage candidate, which of course-- - I've never said. - But perhaps you have\nmore eloquently criticized. So let's go there to the 2024 election. - [David] Okay. - So Biden, Joe Biden officially announced that he's running again. Donald Trump officially announced\nthat he's running again. If that's the matchup,\nwho do you think wins? - If the election's held today? I think Biden. - Why? - Well first of all, I\nbelieve he won last time. And if I start with the results from 2020, and I think to myself what\nhas happened since then that would push or pull\nvoters one way or the other, I have a hard time making a case that Trump is in a better position today than he was in November of 2020. So that's kind of my starting point, which is it's a rematch of an\nelection with a known outcome. What has changed? And I can't make a case for\ncircumstances having changed in Trump's favor. To give a couple of state level examples, Florida seems to be kind of moving more to the Republican side since 2020, but Trump won that state already in 2020. So it wouldn't really change the outcome. Arizona was close. I think Arizona has moved\nto the left since 2020. So I don't see Trump taking that one. Wisconsin, I think the\nsame sort of thing applies. So being very like practical, that would be kind of the\nstart of my reasoning. - Do you think Joe Biden\nis a better candidate now than he was in 2020? - I think he's a worse candidate. This is going to sound ageist, but I think he's a worse\ncandidate in that he's even older and there already seems to be an appetite for younger candidates, particularly on the\nDemocratic voting side. So he's going to be four years older, and in a sense that could be a liability. However, he also is going to have four years of accomplishments. Now, you might not like\nthe things he's done, in which case that would hurt him, but he has started to accumulate a not insignificant\nnumber of accomplishments. Some of the big things that are known, Inflation Reduction Act, and\nCOVID stimulus, you know, but also less well known things, like a bunch of little\ntweaks to healthcare, a bunch of little tweaks\nto student lending. There's been a lot of little things. At the macro level, I don't\nactually think Joe Biden has that much to do with this, the same way I didn't\ncredit or attack Trump for a lot of the macroeconomic stuff, but inflation has started\nto come down significantly, the stock market's quite\nsteady, these sort of things. I think looking historically, it's a pretty okay\nenvironment for Joe Biden, with the exception that he was\nalready the oldest President to be inaugurated in 2021, and he would beat his own\nrecord in January of 2025. And I just don't know how\nvoters are gonna see that. - So in terms of just\na public human being, how would you compare Trump and Biden? So if I were to give\ncriticism towards Trump, it would be that he's chaotic, maybe to the point of being disrespectful to a lot of different groups,\nto a lot of different ideas, to a lot of different nations and leaders and all that kind of stuff. And then the criticism towards Biden would be that he, maybe\nperhaps because of age, or any other kind of\ncognitive capabilities is not really there mentally as a, you know, in the way that\nperhaps you could say like Barack Obama was there. Just mentally being able to\nhandle all kinds of aspects of being a public representative\nof a nation to the world and to the people of that nation. So, which, in the competition\nof personality flaws, which do you think is more powerful? - You've laid out fair, and I\nbelieve accurate assessments of elements of both of those men. You haven't weighed in on to what degree you value each of those assessments, which is where I think the kind of meat of\nthis question really is. I don't see, and I know that, you know, Biden's gonna get us into World War III, World War III doesn't\nseem to be happening. I don't see the Biden deficits you listed, which I agree with you on. I don't see them as\ndangerous or threatening to the standing of the United States in this kind of environment with our traditional western\nallies and geopolitics, et cetera, in the way that the sort of\nunhinged personality of Trump, combined with his lack of\nknowledge about most issues is a threat. So for me, if those\ntwo are the candidates, Biden would be my choice. Now, are there people I would rather see on the Democratic side? Yes. If I knew the President\nwould be a Republican, can I think of better options than Trump? Absolutely. You know, it's so funny, when in 2012 it was Obama versus Romney, the difference seemed so\nsignificant between them. Thinking back, I'm sure I\nwould disagree with Mitt Romney about tax rates and his\nviews on LGBT are, I'm sure, I know are different than mine. But it seems without looking at him with rose colored glasses, so comparatively benign given\nthe four years of Trump. So that's kind of where I come down. - Even McCain and Obama, the differences seemed quite drastic. - Yeah. McCain was interesting because\nPalin, as his running mate, opened the door to the\nsort of cartoonish stuff that we've started to see\non the Republican side. Palin, Trump, Marjorie Taylor Greene, it started going in that direction, which has made the party a bit of a joke, aside from what you believe\nthe tax rate would be, right? You can say taxes are too high, but Jewish space lasers come on, you know? So, but I agree with you on McCain also. - So going back to the\npolitical terms we talked about, where in that spectrum do\nyou place yourself today? Which of the label do you think captures your political views? - Progressive Social Democrat,\nwhich, again is a capitalist. I own my own business. I pay the taxes I'm\nlegally required to pay and not a penny more. And, you know, all those things, that's where I place myself. - Would you place yourself to the left of Joe Biden for Senate? - Yes, yes. - Where does AOC fit into that? - That's a good question. - What do you think\nabout AOC as a candidate? Do you think she eventually runs? - I think that if she doesn't\nrun into some kind of scandal, and I don't mean scandal in the sense of some personal\nimpropriety, that you know, but I mean some kind of\nmajor political problem. It seems that she has the staying power to be in American elected\npolitics for a long time. Whether she would even\nwant to be President, versus maybe going to the\nSenate, or being Governor, or whatever the case may be, I have no idea what her\nambitions are in that sense. But certainly like policy aside, she has this combination of\ncharisma, likability to some, but also something about her personality that angers the people who don't like her in a way that only fuels\nher sort of presence. Which I think applies to Trump as well, that I do think that she\nhas the potential to be, to have significant staying\npower in American politics. President, I don't know. - Do you think that's the\nfuture of political elections and politics in general, is people who are able to skillfully piss off the other side,\nlike AOC and Trump did? - I think it's an aspect of it. I think it's also understanding how to communicate policy ideas. Trump, you know, I have things I can praise Trump about if we wanna get to that\nsegment at some point. You let me know when that is, but I do think that there are some things Trump is very good at. And this is why it's very\nhard for me to believe that Ron DeSantis has what it takes to actually fight Trump\nin a national primary. And one of those things is Trump has a, even though he often\nsays very strange things, that if you transcribe them, you go, what language is that? That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. In the moment, the way he relates to\nadversaries on stage, et cetera, is very good in that he is very much aware of how it is going to\nbe seen by the audience. And so that's why a lot of times, it's more about doesn't matter that a word salad came out of his mouth, how he immediately responded\nand related to the person, very good. So I think that knowing how to be good when clips are shared all the time, often out of context is\nextraordinarily important. Knowing how to use social media, which every election cycle,\nthat means something different. But understanding how to use\nsocial media, very important. Those things are absolutely so important. And whether you're able to do\na deep dive on the deficit, it's certainly useful. But I would say it's a bad thing. It's becoming less important\nin terms of figuring out who we want to represent us. - So just lingering on the AOC, and then maybe let's throw\nin Bernie Sanders on that. So where do you place yourself and how do you do the layout of the land of Bernie Sanders, AOC, Joe\nBiden, and David Pakman? - My instinct is, and\nI'm going to answer it, the thing that makes this\ntough is Bernie says, he's a Democratic socialist. He ran as a social Democrat. He didn't run on anything\nthat was really socialism. So I'm going by their\npublic facing platforms. - I've been listening to\nhim for many, many years, and all the way back to\nthe Thom Hartman Show. And I think using the terms\nas you've been using them, he has, I don't think ever\nbeen a Democratic socialist. I haven't heard him speak about socialism. I think, I've heard him\nspeak about social programs and the value of social programs throughout the history\nof the United States and how they've been beneficial. - My understanding is\nvery similar to yours. Although there may be stuff from the '70s where he really was talking about-- - [Lex] We've all been\nassociated in the '70s. - Yeah, yeah. You and I even who weren't around, we were doing stuff in the '70s. - [Lex] I feel like we did, yeah. - My sense would be, you know,\nBiden is like center left, and then I'm to the left of that. But maybe just inside of\nwhere AOC and Bernie are, or very, very similar to Bernie. I mean I identify with\na lot of Bernie's ideas. Maybe their implementation,\nI'm more flexible on. I'll give you one example, Medicare for all. One way of trying to get\nhealthcare to everybody, which Bernie's very big on, is you take the current Medicare program, you just eliminate the age limit, make it available to everybody,\npay for it through taxation. Interesting. However, I'm open to other models if they get everybody healthcare, that is good quality and affordable. Singapore has an interesting model, Germany has an interesting model. I am more agnostic about how\nwe do it than just saying, let's expand Medicare. Whether that puts me to the\nright of Bernie, I don't know, but I'm not like exactly right there on it has to be Medicare for all. - Yeah, that's more just\nflexibility versus dogmatism. So I don't know if that\nputs you to the left or to the right. - I don't either. - What do you think about the, we could term manipulation\nor the corruption in the DNC that perhaps tipped the\nskills against Bernie in the election? Do you think there was such a-- - In 2016 or 2020? (Lex laughing) - Both, I would say, in different, the dynamics there were\ndifferent with Hillary Clinton and the pressure from Hillary\nClinton as a candidate and so on. I mean, was there, why didn't Bernie win, I guess is one way to ask? - Okay, I think there's\na couple things here. First, the DNC, I'm not a Democrat. Just your audience may not\nknow, I'm just a independent. I mostly vote for candidates\nthat end up being Democrats. In local elections, often\nthere's no party designation. So okay, I'm obviously on the\nleft, I'm not denying that. But the Democratic Party as an institution has never really been interesting to me. - You're still a rebel that resists belonging to any institution. - Exactly right, exactly right. And whether it matters, I don't know. The DNC and the RNC\nreally are organizations that to some degree exist to\njustify their own existence because if they were no longer necessary, they would go away. And so they have to assert their\nvalue and their importance. They do this in a number\nof different ways. Organizing the way that\nthe nominee is chosen, the convention, working\nwith states on everything from redistricting to\nwhatever else the case may be. Setting the order of primaries and having some involvement in how that's all going to happen. And also coordinating behind the scenes, I guess they would describe it\nas making sure our candidates don't get in each other's ways. We might see it and say,\nthey're picking the winner. There's nothing illegal\nabout them being involved in picking the winner, but we might say it's not\nin people's interests. I think the 2020 primary\nwas really interesting. Bernie supporter myself, I started telling my audience\nafter a couple primaries and even before, based on\npolling and different things, I see a real uphill\nbattle here for Bernie. And it's really important, people in my audience are not the average, you know, union worker in Michigan who is mostly working\nand raising a family, and then goes to vote on primary day and goes to vote on election day. If you spend a lot of time\non Reddit and Twitter, you're going to have an inflated sense of Bernie's popularity\nwithin the Democratic Party. That was my sense. And to some degree we saw\nthat in certain states. I don't have the exact\nprimary order in results in front of me or or in my head. But the big turning\npoint was South Carolina. South Carolina was when Joe\nBiden won and won handily, understood to be because of the larger African American population\nin South Carolina. And right around that exact same time, I actually don't remember now whether it was the day\nafter or the day before, some of the smaller Democratic candidates, smaller in terms of support, got out and said, I'm endorsing Joe Biden. And to some degree, of course, it was all organized and timed to help Joe Biden. There's no doubt about that. This is what the DNC does. It's hard for me to be mad at the DNC because this is sort of like, if we believe they were\nthere to be unbiased arbiters and to stay as much on\nthe side as possible, it would make sense to be furious that they've gone against their stated, you know, kind of mandate. But we know that the DNC negotiates and is working behind the\nscenes, and has a favorite, that favorite was Hillary in 2016, 2020. So I share the frustration about\nthe power that the DNC has, but for people who were saying\nthey did something illegal or whatever else the case may be, that doesn't seem to be the case. But this is part of why, I mean, I would love there not to be this duopoly of Republicans and Democrats. And there's probably four major\nchanges that have to happen in order to make that a reality. But I share the frustration\nof folks while recognizing that Reddit was not\naccurately representing Bernie's level of popularity. - Still I wish that the\nbias wasn't towards the, what could be negatively\ntermed the deep state, towards the bureaucracy, towards\nthe momentum of the past, which I think Joe Biden kind\nof represents versus new ideas. Which is funny to say that Bernie Sanders somehow represents new ideas, 'cause he is also an older gentleman. - Well it's a lot of framing. And the other aspect to that is, on paper, Joe Biden's platform was arguably the most progressive of\nany Democratic candidate who won the nomination. Now of course there were\npeople who challenged the nominations who were\nto Joe Biden's left. A lot of this is perspective,\nand it, you know, that's how you end up saying, the guy who's a couple\nyears older than Biden is actually the guy with\nthe fresh perspective. Which is interesting because\nI don't disagree with you. - Yeah, and you also have to say, the perspective doesn't always\nalign with the policies. You're right on, you know, the actual policies of\nJoe Biden are different than maybe the perception of Joe Biden. - Or what he ran on. I mean, just two examples\nI would give are, during his campaign, he\nplayed up a little bit, his interest in doing\nstudent loan forgiveness and something on cannabis. I never bought it. I told my audience, I think\nhe's saying this stuff because this is the way\nthe tide is kind of, the wind is blowing and he's being advised to say this stuff. I don't think he's gonna do very much on either of these things. He did actually do some\nstudent loan stuff. But that would be two examples I think. - Okay, let's go to the,\nsomething you alluded to, which is the pros and cons\nof a particular candidate. Well, what to you, as a critic of Trump, what to you are the pros, the\nstrengths of Donald Trump, and what to you are\nhis biggest weaknesses? - The strengths of Trump. Let's see how I can frame them in a way that is both accurate and accurately assesses\nmy feeling about it. - And could be taken out\nof context most masterfully through the clipping process. - Yes. Trump's strengths are mostly superficial, and in terms of presentation. Trump was able to, I call it a grift. Some on the right say he's just so good at relating to different types of people. Trump as a rich guy from New York City, was able to convince people\nthat he spent most of his life trying to be kept isolated from, that he had their best interests in mind, that he knew why they weren't doing well in the 2016 economy, and that he had solutions that he was going to bring forward. The truth is, he never\nreally liked those people. And as soon as they weren't useful to him for a brief period of time, he, you know, that love affair\nwith his followers stopped, and then now it's back\nthat he needs them again. He didn't really understand\nthe causes of the problems that those folks were experiencing. And his solutions were laughable, right? Like Jared was going to solve the Israeli Palestinian\nconflict in year one. He was gonna replace Obamacare in 2017. Things that were never\ngoing anywhere, anywhere. But what he did really well was he put up a united front of,\nI know what is ailing you, I know how to fix it, and I know how to fix it, I guess, because he's a businessman and he's been above the fray\nof politics for so long, knowing how to use political\ndonations to his advantage. He called that smart, et cetera. I think that's his greatest strength. - Why do you say that the Jared plan for Israel and Palestine and the plan for healthcare\nto improve Obamacare, why do you say that's laughable? - Well, only someone, I would include the\nNorth Korea plan as well, which I'm glad to talk about. Only someone who doesn't know anything about the size and scope of these issues could so arrogantly say\nthat they could solve them in that way and on that timeframe. I'm all for optimism and\nbringing a new face to things, absolutely, without a doubt. But, you know, a wall with\nMexico that Mexico will pay for at the end of my first term. I know there are people who believed it because they would call\ninto my show and say, I'm voting for Trump because of it. But it's hard to believe\nthat anybody serious would fall for that, unless you were deliberately wanting to just believe whatever\nwas being fed to you, or you just hadn't ever thought\nabout these issues before. The healthcare plan, you know, in 2017 they proposed one would've led to 24 million or so people ending up without healthcare. Didn't go anywhere 'cause\nit was so terrible. And then in August of 2020, Trump said, in two weeks I'm gonna finally\nhave my healthcare proposal. It's 2023, we still never got it. You know, with all of these things when you think them through,\nit was just sort of arrogance. And I get the perspective of, I want optimism and I liked that optimism. It worked. I mean fair. A lot of people saw it and liked it. As someone who followed a\nlot of those issues closely, they seemed of course\nlike impossible promises. - Well it's a double-edged sword. So to push back a little bit, if you look at the things I have a little bit more knowledge about, which is the space of\nartificial intelligence, there's a company called DeepMind, and there's a company called OpenAI that we're laughed at for a long time when they were talking about that they're going to solve intelligence. And now they've made, especially DeepMind, and now most recently OpenAI with GPT, they've made progress that\nmost of the AI community would not have imagined\nthey'd be able to make. Everything from AlphaGo\nbeating the world Go champion. Just all the different steps and progress that I can get into,\nwere surprised everybody. And they are legitimately fearlessly pursuing the task of solving intelligence. The other aspect, he gets\na lot of criticism now, but another example is Elon Musk. I can say a lot of things, like SpaceX, so commercial space flight. He was laughed at for a long\ntime that that's possible. Same thing with autopilot in\nTesla, autonomous vehicles. His approach was harshly\ncriticized by all the experts, and still criticized, to\nthis day, deeply criticized. And as a person that I believe objectively can look at the progress of autopilot as a semi-autonomous vehicle system has been incredibly surprising. So the reason I mentioned\nthat is sometimes it feels like you need the guy or the gal who makes those preposterous,\nambitious statements, like we're going to solve\nhealthcare this year. Like, and then there's\nexperts like yourself that are looking, thinking, have you read anything about the history of Israel Palestine, is a good example of that. Do you know there's a history there? Do you realize how complicated,\nhow many people have tried, how many people have failed? How many millions of\npeople hate each other in this little place,\nin this land, that like, sometimes the expertise\ncan really weigh you down. So sort of to push back, sometimes you have to have\nthe almost be naive and stupid and just rush in with an optimism in order to actually make some progress. - I agree with you 100%. I think it's interesting that\nall of the examples you gave of successes are from\nthe technology space. - Not politics, yes. - Not from politics, which I mean, listen, I would love to be able to make headway on some of these issues more\nquickly without a doubt. I do think at some point though, when it comes down to voting and saying, one of these people is going\nto be ostensibly in charge for four years through\nall of the departments, and secretaries and\nchoices that they make, we do wanna apply some level of realism with the understanding that your examples are from the tech space. And they're good examples. There's no question about it. One thing I'll add to this, I recently read Bradley Hope's\nnew book about North Korea, and it's really about an activist who doesn't even really matter, but in the background of the book, it's written, much of\nwhat is written about happens during the Trump era. And when Trump did the\nfirst and then the second, I guess you'd call them\nsummits with Kim Jong Un. And it actually did seem\nlike to some degree, Trump's were gonna handle this like I do a business deal\napproach to Kim Jong Un. In some sense it actually was logical because of Kim Jong Un and the way that it was so ego-driven, and they both as sort of\nauthoritarian strong men types to different degrees wanted that. There was actually a colonel where I actually thought as I read it, Trump's initial idea wasn't crazy. The problem was he knew nothing about the backstory of the relationship. He fell for all sorts of\nlies from Kim Jong Un, and he made offers that\ndidn't make any sense to make. It fell apart, fine. But that's an example where\nI think Trump's personality was not actually at its base, the problem, when it came to North Korea. - Well there's other things of this nature that could go and, or some people argue goes\ninto the strengths and pros of Donald Trump for China, for\nexample, tariffs and China. Can you make the case that\nthere's some positive outcomes of the way Donald Trump acted with China? - It's really tough, and I'll\ngive you a couple reasons. - [Lex] Okay, then also cons. - Give you, it's tough to make. So the China thing is\nreally, so just very recently to when we're recording this, Trump was on Fox News interviewed\nby a guy named Mark Levin. And Trump proposed a new, I\ncall it a conspiracy theory, maybe it will strike you\nas something different about China, COVID, and tariffs. And Trump's suggestion was that the tariffs cost China so much money, China sent the US so much money in tariffs that they released COVID as punishment. Now there's a couple problems with that. One, American companies pay the tariffs. Trump still doesn't seem to know this. Trump seems to believe\nthat when he puts a tariff on Chinese imports, someone in China is cutting\na check to the United States. American companies buy\nthe stuff from China, and then American companies cut\na check to the United States for the tariff. Trump doesn't seem to get that. - But it still has a sting\nto the Chinese economy. - You can make the argument that if there is a suitable\nalternative domestically or from a different country, that it will reduce imports,\nbut it didn't happen. And we actually have reports\nnow that the tariffs on China cost about a quarter\nmillion American jobs. The other problem with that idea is China created and released\na virus in order to hurt you. But as of today, 5.7 of the 6.8 million deaths\nwere in other countries. It's a very indirect way. You're mostly killing\npeople in other countries to hurt Trump. Maybe there was a, this\nis the sort of thing where when I think about\nhow Trump dealt with China, it's very scary. Because given another four years, who knows what he might do if\nhe still doesn't understand how tariffs work. - So geopolitics operates\nin complicated ways with carrots and sticks, and Henry Kissinger has\nwritten quite a lot about this. And in some sense the positive aspect here that Donald Trump is\nwilling to take big risks in the game of geopolitics\nwith this giant superpower that is China. And a lot of others are too afraid, too afraid to call them out, to come to the table and criticize. - I certainly think that's\nan argument that can be made. My question would be, what tangible positive\noutcomes did it lead to? And it's tough to identify any. But I think it's a great thing. I mean, listen, one of the\nthings you're kind of getting at maybe indirectly is that there's been\nthis sense that politics has been done very\nsimilarly for a long time. And even between Democrats\nand Republicans still, even with some policy differences, there's still the kind of feeling that it's disconnected folks in DC, mostly dealing with issues\nthat don't directly affect. Look, I get that. I'm with you on that. I think the question as\nto whether Trump's bluster was positive rather than\nextraordinarily humiliating in many ways, I just come down on, it was an absolute and total humiliation. But I understand that you can recognize Trump doesn't know a lot of stuff, but his attitude was\nrefreshing in some way. That's a reasonable position\nfor someone to take. I disagree with it, but I understand it - Well, is trying and failing\nbetter than not trying? - This goes well beyond politics. You know, Wayne Gretzky\nhas weighed in about this. Michael Jordan has weighed\nin about, I mean this is, yeah, is it better to have\ntried and failed than never? Is it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved? I don't know. I mean, listen, we lived\nthrough four years of Trump. We know what that four year term was like, and it's very hard for me to\nsay that the things he tried were overwhelmingly reasonable. But I get the point you're trying to make, and I appreciate it. And it's, if we don't do any of it, then where do we end up, sure. We know where we ended up with with Trump and it was pretty embarrassing. - Okay, let's linger\non some more strengths. We didn't start any new wars. - [David] We didn't start-- - Is there something to that? - Yeah, that's, it's interesting. There's a few different\napproaches to dealing with that. First, it's really important to remember that the counterpoint to that from the folks who like to say that was that Hillary Clinton\nwas gonna start three wars. Sometimes they say four wars,\nsometimes they say five wars. Okay. The geopolitical situation\nduring the four years that Trump was in office, I don't know that they obviously\nlent themselves to wars that Trump just barely was\nable to keep us out of. I think the Russia thing is interesting, because now it's very\npopular to go back and say, you know, the reason Putin\ndidn't do the Ukraine thing when Trump, right, and to somehow give Trump credit for that. There's a counterpoint to it,\nwhich is Putin under Trump, particularly if Trump got four more years, would've been able to maybe\nconsolidate power in other ways because of his relationship with Trump. I'm not coming down on\none side or the other. It's not my area of expertise. But it's not the open shut slam dunk that, you know, Trump likes to say this. Putin didn't invade because\nhe knew I would crush 'em, and okay. So it's not obvious to me that\nthere were imminently wars that would've started during that time. That being said, you know, for all the criticism\nof Obama during Crimea, Trump seemed to just\nkind of forget about that after all the criticism and say, I'm not actually gonna\ndo anything about that. And so there are foreign policy criticisms that could be made. But it is true, no new wars\nwere started under Trump. And I like that. I don't like wars. - What do you think about\nhis handling of COVID? Can you say, what are the pros and cons\nof his handling of COVID? - The con for him is he'd\nbe President right now if he had handled it differently. I think it's abundantly clear. Early on, and there's now a\nlot of really good reporting about the conversations he was having with Jared Kushner and others. He became convinced, either because of things\nhe was being told, or because he decided this\nis the way it's going to be. This is gonna go away. Fine, it's in China. Okay, it's in China. In Italy, okay, we have 15\ncases, but it'll soon be zero. We'll be open by Easter of 2020. None of it happened. If he had handled it in the following way, and I've said this to Rogan, and I've said this to Patrick Bet-David, and they tend to all see my side of this. If Trump had said, listen, we don't know\nhow bad this is gonna be, but I care too much\nabout the American people to take a shot. So it's not gonna be two weeks,\nit's gonna be a little bit, but I need your help. We're gonna bring everybody together. I don't care if you're a\nDemocrat or a Republican, we're gonna have MAGA masks, and he could have kept\n50 cents on the dollar to pay off Stormy or whoever, right? But it would've been, I\nthink he wins reelection, because the perception was, and reality is a version of that. The perception was that he\nwas way too cavalier about it early on. People died who didn't need to die. And I think that it was\narguably the one area where he could have all but guaranteed that he was going to\nget himself reelected. - Well to push back on that,\nI mean, because you mentioned sort of masks and lockdowns\nkind of a solution to COVID. - I didn't mention lockdowns, but I'm glad to talk about policy. - Sure, quarantine, like there's several\nsolutions to a pandemic broadly speaking. And one of them is a vaccine. And so you didn't mention that. He fast tracked the development. He, his administration fast\ntracked the development of the vaccine, which surprising he didn't\nreally take much credit for. - I think he did, I think he tried. There's a couple, there's a lot there. - Well, to me, it seems\nlike you could make the case with the Trump hand gestures, that his decisions for fast tracking the development of the vaccine saved tens of millions of lives You could make, he could\nin the Trumpian way, make that case. - So, couple different things. I know you don't necessarily\nfollow Trump's rallies as closely as I do, and I'm\njealous of you for that. But he did tout the vaccine\nstuff hugely for a while, until his audience turned against him. And then he had to draw this\nline where he was going, I made the vaccines, which\nnone of you have to take, by the way, freedom. You don't have to take\nthem, but it's fantastic. And nobody else could have done it. But don't worry, nobody's gonna\nmake you take the vaccine. And he actually got booed at\na couple of his own rallies when talking about the vaccines. But let's back up a little bit. Fast tracking, my\nunderstanding of what he did is he did what any President\nin his situation would do, and what many world leaders\nelsewhere did as well, which is he agreed to\npre-purchase supply of vaccine, in order to provide money\nto pharmaceutical companies to scale up the manufacturing,\nwhich is absolutely fine. But he wants, one of the stories he tells is it usually takes 12\nyears to develop a vaccine. We did it in nine months thanks to me. Decades of mRNA technology\nbeing developed, created the platform in which you can make a particular\nvaccine in nine months. Didn't have anything to do with Trump. He did pre-fund and say,\nwe will buy huge supply. And that provided liquidity to\nthe pharmaceutical companies. - But he also delegated control to people, to experts that enabled that kind of fast tracking\nof vaccines, right? - He was very eager for\nthe FDA to approve it, because he saw that there\nwould be a political benefit. - [Lex] And he didn't get in\nthe way, I guess is what-- - He didn't get in the way, fair. I think now we're on the same page. He did not get in the way\nof vaccines being developed, which is good. - Presidents and bureaucracies have a way of getting in the way. - And I don't disagree with that. I'm not aware of really any\ngovernments that got in the way. I mean, it seemed, given\nthe global situation, everybody, European countries\nwere pre-purchasing vaccine. African countries were, who were going to be\nlater to receive vaccines, were partnering with\nthe European countries that had pre-purchased. But the most interesting\nthing about all of this is Trump did play up the\nvaccines for a long time until his crowd didn't\nwanna hear about it anymore, which was crazy. It was sort of like he became a victim of the monster he created to some degree. - One of the effects of all\nthis that makes me truly sad is this division over the vaccines has created distrust in science. - Yeah. - And also what makes me sad\nis the scientific leaders, Anthony Fauci being one\nof the representatives of that community, I would say\ncompletely dropped the ball. - Hmm, in what way? - They spoke with arrogance. They spoke down to people, they spoke in a way that a\ngreat scientist does not speak, which is they spoke with\ncertainty, without humility. Like they have all the wisdom, and all of us are too\ndumb to understand it, but they're going to be the parent that tells us exactly what to do, versus speaking to the\nimmensity of the problem, the deep core of the problem\nbeing the uncertainty. We don't know what to do. The terrifying thing about the pandemic, we don't know anything\nabout it as it's happening. And so you have to make decisions, you have to take risks about, well maybe you have to overreact in order to protect the populace. But it's in the face of\nuncertainty, they have to do that, not powered, empowered by science somehow, and the deep expertise as\nsomebody like Anthony Fauci claims to have. So like the, I just,\nI'm really troubled by, yeah, the distrust and science\nthat resulted from that. And that you have to blame the leaders, I mean, to the degree,\nleaders take responsibility. And I think Anthony Fauci\nwas the scientific leader behind the American\nresponse to the pandemic. And I think he failed as a scientist, as a representative of science. - I'm less, I don't know if\ninterested is the right word, but the kind of the Fauci\nreview is less interesting to me in terms of what comes next than the first part you mentioned, which is the distrust in science. And sometimes I'll get\nvoicemails or emails from people in my audience who say, that I have had to\nbackpedal on certain things related to this. And one of the things I tried\nto do from the beginning was not speak in certain terms when we really didn't\nhave complete information. So there was this period\nwhere hydroxychloroquine was first sort of mentioned\nas a possible treatment, prophylactic, or you know,\nproactive treatment for COVID, or active treatment for COVID, along with a bunch of other stuff. There was ivermectin, there was Vitamin D, there were all sorts of different things. And I tried to be careful to say, right now we don't have rigorous science that tells us that some\nof these things work. It doesn't mean that\nwon't come in the future. At which point, if there was something as\ncheap as hydroxychloroquine that treated COVID effectively,\nunbelievable, fantastic. It's not, there's no way\nit ever will be determined. We don't have that information right now. So it's not super wise right now to go and start taking this stuff. We eventually learned,\nlike with Vitamin D, having an appropriate Vitamin\nD level does seem to be, based on what I've most recently read, generally protective, and a good thing when it comes to infections\nof different, great. Okay, so that one we figured out. One of the really difficult\nthings is that the quote, truth about the vaccines did change. And the original, again, this is all, I don't pretend to be an expert, but just someone who's\nsynthesizing the medical data and writing about it, originally, the first vaccine related to the wild type strain did\nseem to be very effective, not only at preventing\ndeath and serious illness, but also transmission. There were people then saying, it doesn't prevent transmission. Over time, as the variants came forward, the vaccine became less effective at that. At that point I started telling my audience something different, because as far as I was concerned, the reality on the ground had changed. In my mind, that's how science works. It's not backpedaling, it's\nwe're adjusting our beliefs to what is taking place in the real world. - Well, to be fair, the scientists, many of whom are my friends,\nviralogists and biologists, they have way more humility\nthan people like Anthony Fauci, who are speaking about\nthis, or the CEO of Pfizer who are speaking about this. This is the fundamental problem here. Is the way science work is, has, the way science works is there's\nusually a lot more humility and a lot more transparency about what we know and what we don't know. And people like Anthony Fauci thought it would be beneficial for the world if he speaks with more certainty. But because of the political division that formed around that, that certainty resulted in, became completely counterproductive, that people didn't trust\nanything about the vaccine, didn't trust any institutions. There were, that contained the experts that actually knew what they were doing, and basically didn't trust anything that was coming out of\nthe mouths of scientists, some large percent of the population. So that made you\ncompletely ineffective in, at scale, as a society trying to respond to a terrible pandemic. And that's where I put a\nlot of blame on leaders. So political leaders\nand scientific leaders are the ones that should inspire us to all get together and respond, and that should be the\ncase for the pandemic, that should be the case\nin the time of war, all this kind of stuff. - I generally agree with you, and for me it's really about shared blame. And there were a lot of different reasons why that the early\ncommunication wasn't good. Part of it was, I mean, for me, I prefer accuracy\nrather than overconfidence. I would prefer, listen, we\ndon't really know right now whether masks do X or Y. What we do know is the\nsupply is really limited of this type of mask. We're gonna try to keep 'em\nfor the frontline workers. I love that. That's the way I want\nto be communicated to. A call was made to do it differently, which was to say the\nmasks don't actually help, but the real reason is\nthey want to keep them for healthcare workers. And then later the masks\nare what's going to solve. I'm with you 100%. I think the other layer to it, is you can't ignore the\npolitical situation at the time. If Trump had won reelection, and the vaccine\ndistribution had taken place while Trump was President\nrather than Biden, my belief is that the\nsame number of Democrats would've gotten vaccinated, but way more Republicans would've as well, because they were following not science, but political leaders. And when it was Biden\nin DC instead of Trump, a lot of those people said,\nI don't trust the vaccine. But wait, it's Trump's vaccine, I thought. Yeah, but something about the\nway Biden's distributing it. So I do think you can't\nignore that political layer. I agree with you, the\ncommunication was a disaster. - Let me ask you about Joe Biden. What are the strengths and\nweaknesses of Joe Biden? - Weaknesses, I think\nare some of the things you've identified. He is not seen as high energy. He is not the same Joe Biden\nthat debated Paul Ryan in 2012 and ran circles around him, in just an incredible debate performance. He is not inspiring in the way that someone like a Barack\nObama was to people coming up and starting to get\ninterested in politics. I think a lot of those\nare fair criticisms. I think on policy, he's not interested in a lot of the things that younger voters are interested in. I mentioned cannabis reform,\nI mentioned student loans. So I think that that's\na deficit for Biden. I think the upside to Biden, is when it comes to\nforeign policy, diplomacy, high level negotiations, knowing how to engage with\nallies in a productive way, it's tough to find someone with\nmore experience than Biden. I know that there are\ncounterpoints to what I'm saying, and those include that was the old Biden, the new Biden doesn't have it. That includes, that's just a sign of rot because he's been around for so long. Nobody should be around\nthat long in politics. Perfectly reasonable\ncriticisms to talk about. But I do see that as one of his strengths. And he also is good at knowing when he can work with\nRepublicans, and when he can't, and not wasting more time\nthan is sort of expected for posturing reasons. And I think that that's a good thing. - Do you think he's actually there, so in day-to-day operation of government, given his cognitive capabilities, do you think he is an active\nand practicing executive? - I don't know that I can say that it's because of what\nmay be going on cognitively, but my sense from the people I talk to, is that he's very much involved in the highest level geopolitical, and big domestic economic stuff. But that a lot of the smaller issues that presidents might or might not be in sort of plugged into, that he's not plugged into the details of a lot of the lower level stuff. - Yeah, you could probably\napply the same exact criticism even more so towards the\nDonald Trump administration in terms of being a\npracticing active executive who's paying attention. Like for example, like Vladimir Putin is somebody who loves the\nrole of the executive, has a huge amount of meetings, is constantly tracking\ninformation about agriculture and all the different\nsubsystems of government. Stalin, funny enough, was\nalso extremely good at this. So certain people just love\nthe job of being an executive. And I'm not sure if Donald Trump did, and I'm not sure if Joe\nBiden in this current state has the cognitive capability to. - It's a good question, Kim Jong Un's another one by the way. You know, there's videos\nof him examining a pottery, you know, a factory\nwhere they make plates, and making very specific comments about how the plates should be made. I think that in that case, there's a lot of propaganda value to it. With Trump, I think you're probably right. You know, he did get involved\nin the minutiae of things. I mean once he pulled out a weather map, and with a sharpie, drew\na different hurricane path that was more politically\nconvenient to him. That's pretty micro, you know, saying the weather channel's wrong. - I see what you did there. - [David] This is, okay. - I see what you did there. - So that's a micro,\nhe went to Puerto Rico and he gave out paper\ntowels after a hurricane. Now he was shooting them like free throws, which didn't look very good. So he will get involved in the\nmicro when it's advantageous, you know what I mean? But I do agree with you that he wants to just kind of\nmake it, so build the wall. I don't know, just build it,\nfigure it out, get it done. - [Lex] Quick pause, bathroom break. - Sure. - Yeah, you're hilarious. And just for the sake of completeness, I should mention the\nsubreddit, what Biden has done. There's also what Trump has\ndone, but it's not as active. And it has like this master\nlist of all the accomplishments. It's, I recommend people\nlook at it 'cause there's, it's kind of rigorous and\ninteresting with links, a list of all the things he's done. Just to list some of them,\nrestored daily press briefings, canceled the Keystone Pipeline,\nreversed Trump's Muslim ban, required masks on federal property, rejoins the Paris Climate Agreement, extend student loan payment\nfreeze, extend eviction freeze, historic stimulus bill, as you mentioned, ends funding for border\nwall, and so on and so forth. DACA, border strengthening of DACA, rejoins the World Health Organization. And the timing of this\nof course is important. Yeah, several historic stimulus bills, which of course you could\ncriticize or support. Raise the minimum wage\nfor federal contractors and federal employees for $15. There's a lot, there's a lot. It makes you realize\nwith both Trump and Biden that there's a bunch of\nsmall details that matter. - [David] Yeah. - Like that matter on people's lives, like actual little policies. Trump did a lot of stuff as far\nas I heard for the military. Like not big stuff, but small stuff. - Yeah, I'd be curious\nwhat you're thinking of. I mean, I know one of the\nbig things under Trump was we're gonna get trans\npeople out of the military. - [Lex] That's not what\nI was referring to. - You weren't referring to that. He, Trump's hilarious with\nthese stories that he tells, and one of the story,\nand you get to know them, if you follow him at all. He tells the story, you know,\nwhen I came into office, the generals came to me and they said, \"Sir, the cupboards are bare. \"We have no bullets. \"And so I rebuilt the military, you know, \"the cupboards were\nbare when Obama left it, \"and it was just terrible. \"But I rebuilt it and the generals, \"I've got the best generals, they said, \"Sir, it's incredible\nwhat you were able to do.\" You look into it and it's like, yeah, that's not really true. Like it is true that there are armaments that just like on a\nschedule, do get replaced, and that's part of the\nmilitary industrial complex. But there's nothing like\nspecial Trump really did. But these stories become, they take on like a life of their own. And it's interesting to sometimes try to dig down and figure out like, was there any policy connected to that or is that just a story? - Do you think it's possible to have a good conversation\nwith each of them, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, in a podcast context\nor in a debate context? - Absolutely. Yeah, you're saying like,\ncould I with of either them? - [Lex] Yes. - Oh, 100%, yeah. - [Lex] Joe Biden too? - Sure, yeah. - But can you dig into that a little more? - Well, I mean, I don't know what, I think there's maybe something implicit in your question, but-- - That's deeper about\nthe nature of politics and politicians, yes. - I think with either of them, I mean the political differences\nwouldn't be an impediment to having a good conversation\nwith either of them. I think one of the things\nthat's really tough in my experience when\ntalking to elected officials, is they could be super interesting about 100 different topics, but handlers decide or try\nto get you to talk about something you don't really care about and something really narrow, which doesn't bring out\nyour best nor their best. And that's a frustration. But I think that given an unstructured three hour conversation, I think it would be\ninteresting to talk to both. I mean, listen with Biden, aside from his view on\ncannabis or whatever, his background and the incredible unimaginable family tragedy\nthat he had in his first wife, and you know, multiple kids dying. And I mean it's just incredible, you know? And with Trump, I think also you could have\nan interesting conversation. - Yeah, the human beings\nwere the life story. - [David] Yes. And they're some of the\nmost successful humans who have ever lived to have rose to this highest office in\ninteresting complex ways. - [David] Yes. - I mean one of the\nthings I'm troubled by, maybe you can speak to,\nis why we're so negative towards presidential\ncandidates and presidents. Why, it's just they go\nthrough this shit storm no matter who they are. They're like hated. Like all the conspiracy theories, and just the dynamics of how\nwe talk about them is vicious. If you just look at replies to\neven Barack Obama on Twitter, it's like, what is going on here? Why, because we look at other\nleaders in other spaces, and we're generally positive about it. - Yeah, there's a couple different things. There's this dynamic which\nis really unfortunate, which is, you ask people, do you approve of the job a\nparticular president is doing? And very often if at any point\nwhile they were in office they did something you don't like, people will say, I don't approve. And so by its nature what that means is just like the longer you're in office, the lower your approval\nrating's going to be. And very often that's the way it works. I mean there's major events like 9/11 spiked George W. Bush's\napproval to a incredible level. Then it came back down with the Iraq war. But there's this unfortunate thing that when people are just asked, you think Biden's doing a good job? If four months ago Biden\ndid something on healthcare that somebody didn't like,\neven if you like most of it, a lot of people from that\npoint forward will say, I don't approve. They might still vote for 'em, because they like him better than the alternative or whatever. It's just the dynamic of politics. And I agree it's very- - Does it have to be that way, you think? - I don't think it has to be\nthat way, but to unwind it, so many things would have to change. I think our election system\nis part of why politics is the way it is, where you have two choices and\nit's first passed the post, and we have this electoral college so that depending on\nwhich state you vote in, the kind of meaning and\nsignificance of your vote is different. If you vote in Montana, it's the Republican\ncandidate's going to win, and that changes the dynamics. I think that's part of it. I think that at a personal level, I've experienced this in my life a lot. We've become, and by we, I mean\npeople in the United States to some degree who talk about this stuff, we've become uncomfortable\nwhen there is disagreement, and it bleeds over into now we can't have a normal interpersonal\nrelationship anymore. I'm from Argentina, and in\nArgentina it's really common, even in my family, there are incredibly\nheated political debates, at the start, the middle, the\nend of some kind of gathering. But then everybody just goes back to like, okay, we disagree on some\nthings, but that's okay. And we can now go, and you know, finish cooking the beef, or\nwhatever it is that we're doing. And I experienced the civic, even with people who come\nup to me on the street, and they go, just earlier today, a guy came up to me and he said, \"RFK all the way baby\",\ntalking about Bobby Kennedy Jr. And I just kind, you know, I said, \"Oh, all right, you know,\nlet's see what happens.\" And then there was another moment where the guy ended up standing next to me for maybe longer than he thought. And I could tell this\nguy's getting so awkward, because it was an utterance he thought that would just be\non the fly and he'd be gone. But now we're standing next to each other waiting for our sandwiches. It's like no big deal. You know, it's just, oh okay,\nyou like Bobby Kennedy Jr. I don't plan to vote\nfor, it's fine, you know? And that's like a sociocultural thing. I think there's lots of other countries. I've spent time in Italy, I have relatives in Israel where\nlike shouting at each other is sort of like normal. And then you just go back and finish the, it sounds like shouting,\nI'm sort of exaggerating, but very animated, what\nseemed like big disagreements. And then everybody's cool. I wish it were more normal. - So maybe the mechanism of going from shouting to being\ncool again needs to improve, because maybe we can't solve\nthe shouting at each other. - [David] Maybe not. - So maybe we need to somehow\nfigure out the deescalation, like making up, I've had a few recent fights\nwith friends like that. - Really? - Yeah.\n- For politics? - No.\n- Oh. - No, but political style,\nemotionally drenched stuff. And it was interesting to\ngo through that full process and then make up at the end. But it was a process, and it was a process that\nrequired being in person, and talking through it. And it was stressful, the whole thing. And then maybe because most of\nour interactions are online, we don't get a chance to do\nthat in person, making up again. I don't know, but do you think it's a\nfeature or a bug of the system that we're so, we just hate the powerful. - You mentioned the online part. I think it's a, you mentioned\nit earlier perfectly, which is you take\ncontentious political issues, you create a platform that rewards controversy and disagreement, and limits the number of\ncharacters you can use to express yourself. You kind of throw it into a\nbaking dish, and you know, mix the entire thing up. It's complete and total chaos. And one of the things that, you know, I've talked before about all\nthe angry emails and threats and stuff that I get. I'm acutely aware that if I\nhad in-person conversations with most of these people, the conversations would basically be like, oh, we have different views about how to solve some of\nthe problems we're facing. We probably agree about\nwhat the problem is, and we probably share many values. But on these particular four issues, we may have very different\nviews, but that's okay. Online, that's not the case. And it leads to, you know, the mess that we get ourselves in. But I think that it's a\nfeature of a lot of the systems that are being used to\ndisseminate information. - Again, let me linger on that. Do you regret some of the mockery and the snarky use on\nTwitter, and even in your show that kind of feeds that division? - I don't regret it in the sense that it's a calculated\npart or tool that I use in addition to figuring out how to simplify complicated concepts, and choosing stories that I\nthink are underrepresented, and you know, it's all part of like the\npackage of what I'm doing. I recognize that my show is\nnot the audio visual version of a peer reviewed, you know,\nrandomized controlled trial about views on abortion\nor whatever the case. Like I'm very much aware of that. But I don't regret including it as a tool that I've used to build the community in sum total that I've built over the last more than 10 years. - I guess I could ask about\nthe different trajectories you think your show might take. So, you know, the dynamic\nyou had with Donald Trump Jr. and maybe Candace Owens is the\nmore appropriate comparison. Are you okay having that\ndance for the next few years between you and Candace Owens, and just kinda the mockery, the derision that's a part of that process and taking part in that, you know? - I'm fine with it in the sense of, personally I tolerate it well, until it crosses the line, and people pull my family in and- So that's the part that-- - If we set the family stuff aside-- - [David] If I set that aside-- - So just in the digital space-- - I'm glad to mix it up. Now the truth is, Candace Owens\nhas had me blocked for years up until this incident. I don't lie. - [Lex] Did she unblock you? - She unblocked me just to tweet\nabout what I tweeted about. I don't know the backstory\nof that, genuinely, I have no idea. So I don't have a sense\nthat she's super interested in engaging with me on that. But all of these people, I mean Candace Owens is\nwelcome on my show anytime, Don Jr.'s welcome on my show anytime. It's been a decade since\nI had Ben Shapiro on. He's welcome at any time. I'm glad to have these conversations, and I think it's an important thing. And also I wish that everybody was willing to have the\nconversations in good faith, rather than as performance. It's not even really performance, or rather than being simply\nperformative for an audience that you have. - In terms of your\nmotivations, do you see, do you worry about the effects\nof something we spoke of, spoke about offline with\nlike the YouTube algorithm? Are you driven by the number\nof views your videos get, or are you driven by something else? - So in my world, I guess I would say, the number of views that\nany platform generates is a metric that I can\nchoose how to interpret. I can choose to interpret it as, I've created content that's\ninteresting to people, or I've created content\nthat's really angering people, and that's why they're showing up, they don't actually like it, it's because they're angry or\nwhatever else the case may be. But it is true that there\nare algorithmic changes that can take place. Something happened in early January that affected us on YouTube, or there are periods on\nTikTok where you can tell, we're doing all the same things. Something has happened and then you never usually\nfigure out what it is. So for me it's sort of\njust like a general tool to see what is the level of\ninterest in what I'm doing, and are the numbers so out of whack, with what I would expect, that I should look into\nwhether something deeper is happening. Has there been some change to an algorithm or whatever the case may be. I had a debate once with\nsomeone who accused me of using clickbait to generate views, and we had a really interesting\nconversation where I said, tell me really what you mean by that. Is your argument that I'm using titles that don't actually represent\nwhat's in the video? No, what's in the title is in the video. I go, okay, so it's not\nthat the title is dishonest, are you saying I'm\ndeliberately picking titles that will garner a larger audience? And they said, yeah,\nthat's kind of what I mean. And I said, isn't that kind\nof what we're all doing? The alternative would be choosing titles to generate a smaller audience, which seems like a real\nkind of waste of time. So I'm trying to navigate\nand play the game in a way that's comfortable, but use the metrics more as a tool than as something to obsess over. - Nevertheless, the\nmetrics are what they are in that they're able\nto affect your psyche. It's very difficult, which is why I have a Chrome extension that hides all the views and\nall that on YouTube for me. Is difficult not to let it\naffect how you think about ideas. So maybe your extensive exploration of a particular topic like healthcare, generated very few views, is it difficult for you to\nstill care about healthcare? There's some aspect of the human mind that starts being affected by those views. And I think that's a\nreally dangerous thing. Mostly it's probably beneficial, because it probably makes\nyou a better presenter, if you do care about a topic a lot, you become more charismatic, more, you learn sort of\nin Jimmy Mr. Beast way how to present the ideas better. But it also can affect which\ntopics you choose to cover, what you choose to think\nabout those topics, the audience capture of those topics. And that's a really scary effect. I'm really worried about\nmy own mind in that, so I run from that aggressively. - One of the things that I\ninclude in my overall approaches, I don't think about any one clip, I think about an entire\nshow, or a week of shows, or a month of shows. And so it's less about\ndoes one clip do well. My view going in is, I'm going to do stuff\nthat won't do that well, but I think it's really important to do, and I want to make it part of my show. And so when I did a clip with 10 ideas for reducing gun violence, I know that that's not gonna\nget 500,000 or a million views. I know it's just not going to. And the first day it'll\nget 12,000 and I'll go, I don't care, that's fine. There's a group of people in my audience that values this stuff, and I\nwanna keep doing this stuff. I'll end up surprised sometime. And two weeks later, it has 150,000 views because it started being shared, great. But I don't go into it thinking, these all need to be\nhome runs by that metric. I always go in saying, I want to put out a diversity of content, including stuff that is less\ntitillating and salacious, but is important to do, it's\nmore researched, et cetera. And so that's the way I try to resist exactly what you're talking about. - And I think you have to\nprobably know yourself. Like for me, metrics, I\njust like numbers too much. And for me, metrics do affect me. This is why I don't pay attention at all. Like I can't, I would\nlove to hire somebody on the team who cares, 'cause we currently have folks who just, all of us just don't care. 'Cause it probably is good to care enough to kind of just do good\nthumbnails and this kind of stuff to pay attention. But to me personally, I just\nfind inner peace and focus if I don't think about the numbers at all. 'Cause I find myself, I just remember a long time\nago when I started a podcast, I would think that I failed\nif it didn't do well. Like if I didn't celebrate\nthe person well enough, I didn't do a good job\nenough of a conversation, when that's not necessarily\nat all what that means. And it's hard not to like-- - This is tough stuff. I mean yeah, I know\nexactly what you're saying. And part of it is, I mean it starts in my, you have a little bit of a\ndifferent situation than me, because you're doing long form\nconversations with people, and the prep is a little bit different. One of the things in my space, because I'm reacting mostly\nto what's going on in the news and then also picking\ntopics to dive into it a little bit more deeply, is I have very little\ncontrol over the news cycle, and there is a meta\nmetric or a macro metric that affects me, that will quadruple my audience, and then take 75% of it away, which is the seasonality\nof election cycles. And the first few election\ncycles, it's very tough, because I go, it's October, I'm like, at this rate we're gonna\nhave 20 million subscribers by the next, these\nnumbers are unbelievable. And then it's January 30th,\nthe inauguration's over, the debate is about the debt ceiling, and nothing's going on, and I go, nobody's watching my content. I must have forgotten to upload a, like something must be wrong. It's completely beyond my control. So I just, and I think part\nof what you're saying is, I try to focus on the\nthings I can control, and understand those that I really have no\ncontrol over whatsoever, and try not to worry about them. - And try to do the\nthings that make you happy at the end of the day. You mentioned RFK, the guy you met. What do you think about\nsome of the other candidates outside of Joe Biden in\nthe Democratic Party? RFK Jr, what do you think\nof him as a candidate? - I've met him, we once had dinner, and we have a number of friends in common, which is what makes this\na little more awkward. But I think his campaign is basically sort of like a chaos\ncandidacy to raise awareness, and maybe raise money either for his book, or his anti-vaccine organization, Children's Defense Fund,\nI believe it's called. I think there's some reporting that Steve Bannon really liked the idea of him running as a Democrat, again, to just generate chaos. I don't find it super interesting. I don't find it worthy\nof that much discussion. Smart guy, nice guy, has\nbeen doing anti-vaccine work that I don't find particularly inspiring. - So it's not just anti-COVID vaccine, it's more broader than that? - He's been in that space long\nbefore the COVID vaccines. Yeah, I don't find it super interesting. - Well, he also wrote the\nbook, The Real Anthony Fauci, is that the name of the book? - Did he write that? That's, I don't know. I'm not sure about that. I'm aware of that book, I\ndidn't know he wrote it. - I think I need, but it's\nbeen on my reading list to get, I've been trying to get a\ngood balanced reading list about the COVID pandemic, to understand what the hell happened. And anytime I start to\ntry to go into that place, it's just, I'm exhausted by it. - Well, it's interesting to me\nthat you wouldn't wait longer before delving into those books, to have maybe a more clear hindsight. - But I think this is a pretty good time. You don't think so? Like this, it depends on your goals. If you're thinking of it\nas a historical event, yes, you should probably wait longer. But if you're thinking\nabout like understanding what is broken about our system, that we responded so poorly, that there was so much division? What is broken about our political system that it didn't unite us, it divided us? Who's to blame? There's probably a lot\nof different narratives, but I feel like the more\nyou learn about this, the better you can understand. I've read on just Vladimir Putin, I read like five biographies\nalready, maybe more. Just it helps to really\nunderstand, the people involved, the organizations evolved. I don't know, everything\nfrom the scientists to the political leaders. It felt like the blog posts and the tweets didn't quite capture. - They didn't quite get. No, one of the things I read a ton, I don't read any like\nmodern political books. So I don't read the memoirs\nof elected officials. I don't read any, I just feel like I get\nenough of it in my job. So my reading list is just other things. It's history, it's narrative non-fiction, economics, et cetera. And that's my bias\nbecause I'm so overloaded with a lot of the stuff\nyou're talking about. I haven't read any of Obama's books. I didn't read John\nBolton's book, or you know, I don't read any of that stuff. Although I'm sure there is\nvalue to be gleaned from it. - What about the other candidate that, according to the subreddit, and as you mentioned, you've\ncriticized a little bit, Marianne Williamson. Do you think, what are the pros and cons\nof her as a candidate? - This is another area\nwhere many in my audience really are angry with me. I don't find her candidacy\nsuper interesting. I'll tell you the pros and\nthe cons as I see them. I do think that we have\nelected officials in the US, particularly presidents, from a really narrow range of backgrounds. So it's lawyers and\nsometimes business people, very, very often lawyers. I think we would benefit from a much greater\ndiversity of backgrounds. And I once said, and that would include\npeople from education, people from the science world, people with backgrounds maybe\nrunning nonprofits, et cetera. Now Marianne Williamson\ndid, I guess at one point, run some kind of small nonprofit, and some in my audience\nthought that credential alone would make me fall head over heels in love with the idea\nof a Marianne candidacy. I've interviewed for her. It's just not for me is\nthe way I like to say it. It's the background of\nthe woo-woo type stuff is a bit off-putting to me. I understand that someone with literal Christian Bible\nbeliefs that also I don't like, maybe I'm more willing to accept as most of our presidents of\ncourse have had those views, because they're otherwise more qualified. But some of the things that she says, just strike me as, I just don't know. I'll give you an example. When she was on with Russell Brand, she said there's no such\nthing as clinical depression. It just means someone in a clinic told you you have depression. I don't believe that to be the case. I think we have an understanding, there's two types of depression. There's like a genetic\npredisposition depression, there's like a acute,\nsomething's happening in my life, temporary depression. You know, when she was asked\nabout it recently, she said, \"I didn't mean it, \"I was just trying to\nimpress Russell Brand.\" I don't know if I'm more bothered by the things she first said, or by the fact that she wanted\nto impress Russell Brand. But it's just like, it's\njust really not for me. And I agree with her on, we need to take the\nclimate more seriously, we need to expand access to health. I'm with all of that stuff. Now I wanna say one\nother thing about this. Anybody who wants to run should run. I am not suggesting there should be an uncontested\nprimary for Joe Biden. Absolutely. - So you think he should be contested? - Well what I mean by contested is, so there's two parts to\nwhat we mean by contested. Will the DNC organize debates? And we'll get to that in a second, but should anybody who's on\nthe left get out of the way because Joe Biden is President and he's running for reelection? Absolutely not. The question about\nshould there be debates, I would like there to be debates. The DNC pretty clearly isn't\ngoing to organize them. I think if you did them, you would have to say at what\npolling level do you qualify? And I don't know exactly\nwhere you put that number. But I think it would be a great thing to put Joe Biden on a stage with, if you can get, what, 6%, 8%, I'm not really sure what\nthe number would be. I'm totally all for that. - Why is this set of candidates, at least from my perspective, so weak? Do you have an understanding of this? - There's a lot of\ndifferent answers to this. One aspect to this, which I think is more of\na sociocultural thing, which I've recently read\nabout to some degree, is the job actually turns off the people who would be best at it, because of what you need\nto do to become President. And it includes all but\ncompletely abandoning your existing day-to-day life\njob, which you may depend on, and family to some degree. It's horribly negative, as\nwe already talked about. And at the end of all of that, you either lose and then have to rebuild, and maybe you're not in a\nposition to be able to do that, or you win and then now\nyou've got four years of being one of the most hated people, no matter how good a job you do. So I think by its nature it\nturns off a lot of people that would otherwise be good. I also think that there's\na lot of posturing from within the parties about, well, you might be good\nbut it's not your time yet, so you should wait. And then let's talk about maybe a Senate seat here and there. So it's like a company essentially, and they're figuring out\nwhere they wanna place people. I think all of these things make it so we end up with candidates most people aren't super thrilled with. - So it's difficult for somebody\nwho's young or an outsider to quickly become a candidate. - I think that that's true, and I think also in a lot\nof ways it's just not, I mean, would you wanna be President? - No. - I mean I can't be 'cause\nI wasn't born in the US, so it's easy for me to say, but. - If everyone says no, then we're get the people that we have. - No, I understand that. - So I would love to help somehow. - [David] Sure. - And I feel like there's not\neven a mechanism for helping, except through the democratic,\nthrough the voting process. But I'm just annoyed how\nlittle technology there is in the whole process, how little innovation there\nis in the whole process, all of this. - The sad thing is, this\nis written about a lot, which is there's this thing\ncalled political hobbyism. And I think there's a good chance that some of the people in my audience are political hobbyists in the sense that they follow this stuff as entertainment to some degree. And I've written a lot about how, I've read a lot and\ntalked a lot about how, okay, we vote every two\nyears or every four years in our local elections, et cetera. And then we think about\npolitics all the time. Neil Postman wrote about this in his book, Amusing Ourselves to Death. But what are you actually\ngoing to do about the kids starving in this country, and the nuclear buildup in that country? It's okay, if everybody\nrefocused their attention on their immediate communities, and that could mean any number, it could mean the town\nor city you live in, or it might mean an\nathletic club or whatever. If everybody this time they\nspent on political hobbyism, they moved somewhere else, which might put me out\nof a job, that's okay. I'm willing to lose my job because I think it would be so beneficial, then our communities would\njust be that much better, because you can actually affect change in a much more tangible way locally, whether it's, people talk about potholes, but other things as well. - Yeah, and I wish our\nsystem was more amenable to that kind of contribution. Hopefully through the\ndigital space, it would be. Let me ask you about on the\nRepublican side, Ron DeSantis, what do you think of him as a candidate running against Donald Trump? - I think in the couple of weeks before our discussion today, his campaign, which hasn't even started, has sort of started to implode. And this was something that\nI started thinking about in September, October. He really doesn't seem\nready for primetime, in the sense that just being confronted, and confronted is not even the right word, just being asked about some topics he didn't really seem\nto want to talk about. He responded in such a sort of disproportionate, unhinged way. During his recent trip to Asia, he was asked about why aren't you or why are you responding\nbut in this weird way to Trump's attacks on you? And he went into this\nweird bobblehead thing with a weird smile, and something came out\nthat didn't make any sense, and he sort of got mad at the reporter, and it was just like, if\nyou can't handle that, you can't be on a debate\nstage with Donald Trump. And again, for all my criticisms of Trump, the guy gets you on a debate stage, he can make you look pretty silly. He was recently asked about\nhis role at Guantanamo Bay when he was an officer in, I forget which branch of the armed forces. And he just sort of\nattacked the journalist asking the question, and\nit just looked very bad. And there are increasingly\nbig Republican donors who are not fans of Trump and were sort of hoping to put their eggs in the Ron DeSantis basket who are saying, this guy just doesn't have what it takes, I don't think he can do it. So I don't know if DeSantis\nwill be able to get away. Once you're polling 20\nsomething like he is, and you haven't even announced,\nit's very attractive. And he probably to some\ndegree is thinking, if I wait till 2028, I might not have this opportunity again. But Trump's polling 52, 53, which means even if DeSantis gets all of the current non-Trump vote, he has to figure out how to\ntake something more from Trump. I just don't know how he does it. - First of all, the implosion aspect, that's part of the process, isn't it? You kind of implode a bunch of times. - [David] And then rebuild yourself. - And rebuild and because the\nnew cycle kind of forgets. - It's possible. The problem is if he, the\nfirst debate is in August. So that's only a few months away, and the decision's going to\nhave to be made pretty soon. And unless he can get\na new momentum going, I just don't know how\nhe gets what he needs in order to really have a shot. - So would anyone else\nrun against Donald Trump? - It's very tough right now. I mean there are other people running. There's this guy, Vivek\nRamaswamy who's running, Nikki Haley is running. Her campaign basically dead on arrival. Trump actually does better\nin polls the more people run. When it's just him and DeSantis, that's the best scenario for DeSantis. It's not great for DeSantis,\nbut it's certainly better. But I think the difficulty is, this is a question for\nRepublicans to figure out. The people who rightly recognized in 2016 that this guy is not good for their party, still believe this guy is\nnot good for their party. But many of them recognize\nthat most of the voters are still behind him. You can always say, it's early, his polling doesn't really mean anything. Anything could happen. Something major would have to happen for Trump to lose that\nlead, if he got more, if he was arrested two more\ntimes, and had more indictments, and it just became like\nthis guy can't even campaign because he's so busy\ngoing from court to court. Maybe that would make a difference. It's really tough to imagine. - You said that there are\nthree categories of people who vote Republican, and that Trump introduced the fourth one. Can you go through the four categories? - Sure. So you've got like your\npro-business, low tax Republicans. These are mostly people like Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney has a bit of the\nsocial conservatism as well. He's Mormon and that's there. But Mitt Romney primarily, particularly as a northeast\nsort of Republican, I mean, I know Utah, but\nGovernor of Massachusetts, he is like a low tax\npro-business type guy. You've got your libertarian\ntype Republicans who are primarily about\nfreedom and liberty. Often they are actually\nmore socially Liberal where they go, I don't\ncare about gay marriage, Liberal, you know, I don't\ncare so much about abortion. And that overlapped a little bit with the Tea Party Movement in 2010, although Tea Party did\nhave a religious component, but sort of like the libertarian\nfreedom-minded folks, and then the religious Conservatives, people that support candidates like Josh Hawley, or Ted Cruz, et cetera, where their big thing are social issues. Often they actually want Christianity, being civil government. They don't want separation\nof church and state. Those are traditionally the\nthree Republican groups. The one that Trump introduced was people who just didn't\nreally pay attention to politics, but either followed celebrity, or had grievances that they\ndidn't yet have scapegoat for, and were sort of right-leaning culturally even though they didn't\nattribute that to Republicanism. And Trump was able to\nbring them into politics often for the first time as voters. They could be part of\nany of those three groups if they get more into politics or kind of be their own thing. But they're more kind of\nlike cult of personality, I'm here for Trump types. - Did it have to do anything\nabout the culture wars and the identity politics,\nall that kind of stuff? - Yeah, I mean, so in 2016\nwhen Trump mobilized them, those weren't really issues\nthe way they are now. So I think at that time, it\ncertainly was not a factor. - What was the mobilizing issue? Was it just anti-Hillary in 2016? - He did a good job on anti-Hillary, but a lot of it was identifying\nreal economic problems, wage depression, lack of\njobs in parts of the country. You know, Ohio and Indiana, Trump rightly identified\nlike we have an issue here, we don't have enough\nentrepreneurship, et cetera. But there was also a lot\nof scapegoating that was, you know, China and people coming through the US-Mexico border\nwere popular scapegoats for a lot of those problems. This gets us kind of to populism. Populism is a rhetoric, and populism as a rhetoric\ndoesn't necessarily come with particular policies. You can be a populist, a user of populist rhetoric\nand proposed solutions that would be more aligned\nwith Bernie or Tucker Carlson. Populists will often identify the plight of the middle class. The difference would be Bernie will say, we've gotta put some restrictions on how much billionaires can make, and we've gotta reinvest\nin these social programs. Tucker will say, BLM taking your house, and a brown person from\nMexico taking your job are what we need to deal with. So the the populist\nrhetoric can lend itself to very different policy, and Trump used that very\neffectively in 2016. - Why do you think Hillary Clinton was hated as intensely as she was by a certain percent of the population? It feels like that's the\nfirst election I witnessed where there's a lot of hate. Maybe I'm misremembering. I don't remember Obama, I don't\nremember the degree of hate. There was conspiracy theories that he wasn't born in this country, but I don't remember hate towards Obama. - Record death threats under Obama more than any previous President. - Towards who, towards him? - Towards him, yeah. Do you mean more hate between voters or- - Between voters. Between voters, but like that's I guess\nwhat I was speaking to, but that hate was directed\ntowards the narrative, the thread that connected\nall of that in 2016 was Hillary Clinton. - Few different things. And I'm not ranking these, these are just all\nthings that come to mind. One is Hillary Clinton had been around in the political space for a long time, from her time as First\nLady, through as Senator, Secretary of State, et cetera. So I think that there was\nenough time for different groups to develop an antipathy towards\nher for different reasons. So time. Secondly, Trump's\nbranding of her as crooked was very effective, where there were so many people demanding that she be imprisoned. If you ask them what is\nthe crime, they don't know. But she should definitely be locked up. That became a very big thing. The email story as it were, and James Comey doing\na second public event about that investigation, even though there wasn't\nany actual news about it, just doing a second event\nabout it at the last minute, I think hurt her and\nalso generated some hate. And I don't find Hillary Clinton\nto be particularly likable, although I voted for her, I thought she was the better candidate. And I think that there are others who also didn't find her\nparticularly likable. Those are a lot of impediments\nto becoming President. - Well I was trying to understand why there's so many conspiracy theories about Clintons in general, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. And I, maybe I'm not\nresearched well enough. - [David] Of the why of it. - The why of it, actually the extent of\nthe conspiracy theories, the sort the conspiracy theories that they've killed a lot of\npeople, this kind of stuff. - It's hard for me to speak to them because I'm aware that they exist, but I'm not an expert in them, because they seem so obviously baseless, to the degree that I've\nresearched them a little bit, and then I move on, and you know, it's been years since I've looked at this stuff. I know there's the Seth Rich one, and there's the Clinton body count one. I think there's one connected to Epstein if I recall correctly. There's all sorts of these different ones. Without speaking to any\nof them specifically, because I'm not the expert\non Clinton conspiracies, it does seem as though\nthis stuff for so long has generated an audience. I mean, I remember in the supermarket when Bill Clinton was\nPresident at the checkout seeing the tabloids, and there were stuff about\nHillary birthed an alien baby, and, you know, all the, it seems like it's been\ntitillating to people for a very long time. - Well, another question from\nReddit, speaking of aliens. I would be curious to hear David's views on conspiracies and conspiracy theories, the extent to which real\nconspiracies happen, and why conspiracies that have\nlittle evidence behind them managed to be so compelling\nto people regardless. Also, please bring up aliens and UAPs. - [David] Okay, where do we start? - The conspiracy, so what are, in general, as a person who thinks about politics, thinks about this world, like where do conspiracy\ntheories fit in for you? - I think there have been conspiracies, and by conspiracies, I'm\nusing a colloquial definition, which is basically individuals\nworking together to, in a clandestine way, impact or affect some kind\nof event or phenomenon very, very broadly. I mean, certainly that\nthose things have happened. To pick, to jump around\nto some of the things that were in there, I think the reason that\nconspiracy theories are so compelling, is that it's really tough\nfor a lot of people to accept there are random events, not\npredictable specifically. At a stochastic level, we\nmight be able to predict them, but specifically unpredictable,\nbad events in many ways. I could be the victim\nof one, or you could, or my family could. That's really scary to a lot\nof people understandably so. And for some people it's less scary and more soothing in a way to say, there aren't really\nrandom events like this. Somebody planned it. And if we had just known who planned it, it just could have been stopped because we would've known exactly when. That's just a psychological level, easier to accept for people. And I get that to some degree, because listen, it's not\nthe most exciting thing that everything can just be going fine and something absolutely\nhorrible happens and kills, who knows, some number of people or. So I think that's the biggest at attractor to a lot of these conspiracy theories. It doesn't apply to all of 'em though. - But yeah, but there's still\nkind of a basic understanding of human nature where people, some people are greedy and want power, and are corrupted by power. So there's kind of these\ncompelling narratives that stick that, I don't know, the\nvaccine is a opportunity for a powerful billionaire\nto implant chips into you so he can control you further. - [David] Right. - It doesn't seem, what do I want to say? It's like, for some reason, that doesn't seem as crazy as it should, because you think like maybe\nHollywood contributes to that. But you think, yeah, you\ncould imagine an evil person, a person that wants more\ncontrol, more power, and is also at the same time\nable to convince themselves, as history shows, that they're actually\nhave the best interest of the populace in mind, that they're trying to\ndo good for the world. So they do evil while trying to do good. And you can kind of imagine it. So it's like, why not? And you listen to people\nin power, authorities, they kind of look and\nsound shady, you know? Like the transparency,\nespecially the older ones. I think younger folks are better at being like real and transparent, and just like revealing their\nflaws and the basic humanity. But people that are a little bit older, in the positions of power,\nthey're more polished. They're more like, it feels like they're\npresenting a narrative, what the truth is hidden in the shadows. - I don't think there's\nanything wrong with suspecting, maybe a public figure isn't\ngiving me the full story. Totally reasonable thing to question. I don't think there's anything wrong with exploring a lot of\nthese different things. I think the problem becomes, and I know you've talked about this in so many different\nways with other guests, the problem becomes when we\nlose a shared understanding of how we would assess whether\nany of these things are true, and then both alleged evidence\nand then absence of evidence, both become supportive\nof the conspiracy theory. Because if there's bad evidence, you manipulate it and\nsay it's good evidence. If there's no evidence, you say the evidence was obviously hidden by the people who carried\nout the thing or whatever. So unless we can have\na shared understanding of how we would determine what's true, these are common conversations often between atheists\nand religious folks. How can we deter, like,\nis my faith in something or my desire for something to be true a good way to evaluate whether it is true? They're really similar questions. - Well, let me ask you\nabout Trump on that front, about the election, 2020 election. And maybe the better question\nis about January 6th. Do you think January 6th was a big deal? - I do. - [Lex] How big of a deal? - Compared to what. - Civil War. - I think it was less of a\nbig deal than the Civil War. - [Lex] Okay. - No, I mean, so you, well that it's a very\ninteresting thing though, right? Because we have not only the event, that's clever actually. It's not only the event,\nbut it's what led up to it, and what has happened since, and did it change what is\nconsidered on the table that citizens can, should or might do if they disagree with the\nresults of an election? So I think that there are\nfurther reaching consequences than just the six hour\nperiod on January 6th, a bigger or smaller\ndeal than the Civil War? And there's so much wrapped up into it. Many conspiracy theories flowed\nfrom January 6th as well. 60 Minutes recently featured\na guy named Ray Epps who was targeted by some on the right, claiming that he was an\ninstigator or an agent of the FBI or something along those lines. There were people claiming that no real it was like a No True\nScotsman sort of thing. Like Trump supporters wouldn't riot, so by definition it must have been Antifa, police let 'em in, or\npolice were, you know, all these different things. I think it was a big deal in a lot of ways because it completely made\nus have to go back to the top to say, okay, what are the parameters of valid discussion and\nactivism in the United States? - But what aspect of the\nJanuary 6th was bad for you? - [David] Well, I mean. - If you're thinking of\nfrom a big philosophical, political perspective, so presumably the number of people hurt and the number of people who died is not the only metric to consider here. - Absolutely. I think the sum total of what it means about how the United States operates is what's most concerning. And I'll kind of just like\nflesh it out a little bit. So summer of 2020, Trump's already saying\nthey're going to cheat. Now the polling is close, but it shows that Biden's\nin a good position, people aren't happy with Trump. Any reasonable person would look and say, it's gonna be close, but Biden certainly wouldn't\nbe a crazy thing if Biden won. Trump's already saying they're gonna cheat with mail-in ballots, or they're gonna cheat with early voting, or they're gonna cheat with machines, or we should do only in person or whatever else the case may be. We have the election. We knew in certain states how the vote count was going to go. Some states stopped counting at 10:00 PM, some states count all of\nthe mail-in stuff up front, some don't. Everything was completely predictable. At 2:00 AM, Trump comes\nout and says, I won. Okay, but where are you getting that, Sir, as he claims people always refer to him, where are you getting that? And with that statement,\nimmediately we see that there is a large\nportion of this country that either is unable or unwilling to say, wait a second, the polling all said this was a real possibility. The counting schedules\nare all being adhered to, but Trump won? That doesn't make any sense. That doesn't happen. It builds. People are donating millions\nto Trump for supposed audits, which nobody can define, and\nlawsuits which go nowhere. And it builds and builds and builds. And we have a total separation\nfrom a factual reality. There's no reason to think,\nby December 1st, right, give three weeks to look\nthrough some of this stuff. By December 1st, there's no\nreasonable case to be made that Trump actually won. But it doesn't end there. It goes into, maybe we can just like\nsend different electors, even though Biden won\nArizona, let's just like send, I don't remember how many\nelectors it is in Arizona. Let's just like send\nRepublican electors to say, we vote for Trump. But that's not democracy. That's not the way the system works. Let's make sure we're ready. Ready for what exactly? And then it builds to, maybe Mike Pence can\njust like prevent Biden from being President, or maybe we can just\ninterfere in this other way. And then it gets to, let's\nbreak into the Capitol. It's the height of saying we\nno longer comport ourselves attached to what is a\nverifiable factual reality. And when we no longer do that, we're also willing to commit\ncrimes, property crimes, violent crimes, okay, to different degrees in order to try to have\nsomething other than democracy. It wouldn't be democracy if any of those things had happened. - Yeah, I think it's not the height of it. I think there's still a case to be made that that did not leave\nthe realm of protest, versus a violation of the\nprinciples of democracy. So to me, the height of what\ncould happen on January 6th, is if Donald Trump was\nmuch better executive, he could take control of the military. - [David] If it had succeeded. - No, not even succeeded. The attempt would've been more empowered. - [David] I understand. - So like, the way not to bring\nup Hitler every other word, which is something your subreddit had also told me not to do. - [David] Okay. - He's kind of an important figure and it's interesting to\nstudy that moment in history 'cause it reveals so\nmuch about human nature, and that all of us are\ncapable of good and evil. But thank you dear subredditor or redditor for your contribution to the conversation. I will keep bringing up\nHitler and the Third Reich and I'll keep bringing up Stalin. There's so much to learn from that. Anyway, the, an effective\npracticed authoritarian could roll the tanks out\ninto the city streets to establish order. And in so doing pause\nthe process of democracy as opposed to a few\nprotestors breaking in, to a questionably protected building. - I agree that what you're\nsaying would be worse. I don't want to use it to minimize what the protestors were intent on doing. They failed fortunately. - But to you, the intention was there too. - Well, the intention was\nTrump should remain President. That's the intention. And to what length they\nwould've been willing to go if by the evening, early evening, they, you know, were sort of\nlike forced out, I don't know. I agree with you that Trump\ntrying to use the military would absolutely be worse. You know, there's these reports that he tried to seize voting machines, which is kind of funny 'cause it's like, once you get the machine at Mar-a-Lago, what do you do with it\nexactly, I don't know. There's a like a comedic element to Trump sitting around\nwith voting machines. But he did float trying\nto do some other things. I don't believe there's reporting that he actually tried\nto use the military. - I wonder to what degree\nthis opened the door to further things like this\nwith other candidates on, you know, even in the\nDemocratic Party also. Do you think there would be\nmore and more questioning of the election results? - There has been already. It's very clearly the playbook. Kari Lake lost, she ran for Governor in\nArizona 2022, she lost. What I mean by that is her\nopponent received more votes. It's like very clear what\nit means that she lost. She insists to this day\nthat she won, to this day. She did the same grift\nTrump did about donate, we've got a case, we won in the case. You didn't win. They just set a court date. Like that's not, you know? Lies upon grift upon lies. So they did it then. It is, it's extraordinarily saddening, but it seems like this is now going to be part of the playbook. - Do you think people on the\nleft will start doing it? - I don't have a reason to believe that that is going to happen, but I'm not going to say it never could. It certainly could. People on the left could\nstart using it as a tactic. Right now, there's not a sign\nthat that's going to happen, but it's certainly could. My expectation is, and\nI'm not a betting man, but I would bet money. If Joe Biden loses in November of 2024, he will say, I lost, he\nwill call the winner. He will concede and he\nwill leave the White House in an orderly fashion. - You don't think there will\nbe claims of a hacked election? The ability to hack elections is becoming more and more effective with the developments on the\nartificial intelligence side. - The difficulty is\nyou're basically saying, will something happen without me knowing anything\nabout the election? Imagine there really was\nevidence of a hacked election, then I would want those claims to be made. But the way elections\nhave gone in the past, I don't expect that that's a\nclaim that would be made, no. - Speaking of evidence of\nthings that were claimed, what do you think about\nthe Hunter Biden laptop, or as you tweeted, The\nLaptop From Hell TM. - [David] Right. - To what degree was this\nlaptop story important and to what degree was it not? - At this point, I have said many times, if there is any reason to\nbelieve that Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Naomi Biden, Jill\nBiden, Hillary, Obama, Doug, if there's any evidence any\nof them committed a crime, they should be investigated,\nthey should be charged, and they should be tried, period. The Hunter Biden laptop thing has been floating around for so long, and we still have zero\nactual pieces of evidence of any crime, particularly\ninvolving Joe Biden. There's the claim from some\nthat references to the big guy, are about Joe Biden getting\n10% for some illicit, it's been years they've been saying this, they've not been able to bring\nforward any evidence on it. So my assessment of the\nHunter Biden laptop is, it seems to mostly be a story about nude images released\nwithout someone's consent, which is illegal in most states, and violates Twitter's own policies. That's the main story to me. Beyond that, I don't know how many people have a copy of this hard\ndrive at this point. Rudy had it. Tucker, do you remember when\nTucker, this is unbelievable. Tucker said that he mailed\nhimself a copy, a USB stick. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it got lost in the mail. You have the mother load\nproving the criminality of Joe and Hunter Biden, and you just dropped it off with a stamp and it got lost in the mail. You don't have a backup copy, you don't- So I'm ready for the\nevidence to come forward. Hunter Biden has nothing to do with Joe Biden's administration. But as a person who, if\nhe committed a crime, charge him, investigate 'em, whatever. But it's getting, it's\nalmost getting satirical, the degree to which they're talking about the Hunter Biden laptop. - Well what do you think about the social media aspect of\nthis, that story got censored, and what do you think\nabout censorship in general on social media that that\nstory during an important time in the electoral process got censored? - So I, as a matter of principle, I think we have to define\nwhat we mean by censorship. But I'm against censorship,\nshort of illegal content, I guess is the way I would put it. I do respect a company's\nright to have terms of service and to enforce them as long\nas they're not illegal. If Twitter were to say, we don't publish content\nfrom Jewish people. Okay, now we've got a\nproblem on our hands. But what is dubious to me is the claim that had people been able to\nsee Hunter Biden's genitals, they would've voted for Trump. Which I know it's like,\nDavid, you're making light of- And, but at the end of the day, what exactly is the claim that if you had known\nmore about Hunter Biden, I guess allegedly hiring prostitutes and having a drug problem\nand seeing pictures, you wouldn't have voted for Joe Biden? I mean, I know me as a\nvoter, I don't feel that way. - I think it's less about\nthe content of the story and about the actions of\na social media company to control what you see\nand what you don't see. So you could imagine\na social media company like Facebook and Twitter\nmaking the same kind of decision about a more impactful story than a few dick pics on a laptop. - Well, I think if that happened, then my view might be different, right? But I do, my general view though on the Hunter Biden story is, had the articles not\ncontained those images that were illegal in many states and violated Twitter's policies, I would say publish it, absolutely. I don't think it would've had an impact, but I would be in favor of it being, of the links being allowed, 100%. - Okay, you mentioned Tucker. What do you think about\nTucker getting fired from Fox? You're a media person\nthat works independently. - [David] Yes. - Tucker was a media person\nwho doesn't work independently. - [David] Right. - Yeah, what do you think about\nthat particular situation? Is it representative of some big shift that's happening in mainstream media? - What would the shift be? - Basically, mainstream media freaking out because the funding is getting less and\nless and less and less. And there's gonna give more power to individual commentators, basically Tucker Carlson\njust starting a podcast, and a YouTube channel. - I think that's what he should do. I think that's the most profitable path rather than maybe going\nto work for Newsmax or whatever the case may be. But the firing fundamentally was not a politically oriented firing that suggests Fox News is\nchanging its tune politically in any way. There's no evidence of that whatsoever. Tucker Carlson basically\nbecame a legal problem for Fox News. There's really four points to it. One is the $787 and a half\nmillion settlement with Dominion partially was because of the claims that went out on Tucker Carlson's program. So to some degree, Tucker's\nprogram was a prominent node of the problematic claims that became the subject of the lawsuit. That's number one. Number two, Smartmatic, which is another voting machine company, still has a similarly sized\nlawsuit against Fox News, based on the exact same sorts of claims. It may cost Fox News again. So this is now two problems that Tucker's a big contributor to. Number three, former Tucker\nstaffer has brought a lawsuit, and I don't remember the exact claims, but I know that there are claims of different types of discrimination. It seems like it has legs, and that may be a third payout\nrelated to Tucker Carlson. And based on the 60 Minutes\npiece from a few weeks ago, Ray Epps saying, Tucker ruined his life by\nfomenting conspiracies about him around January 6th. That's ripe for another lawsuit. So to me, Tucker's firing was\na risk mitigation strategy of many that will be employed as these lawsuits come forward. There's no evidence that\nit's because Fox didn't like, and what we mean by that,\nwho are we talking about? Rupert Murdoch doesn't\nlike, or the, I don't know. But I don't have any reason to believe it's because Tucker's ideas\nwere no longer welcome on Fox. Certainly the audience liked them. - So interesting, it's not about, it's not even about the ratings, it's about just the legal costs. - Fox is interesting, the ratings question is\ninteresting, because Fox, unlike most other or every\nother cable news channel, they negotiate a fee from\nevery cable subscriber. If you have Fox News as a channel, even if you don't watch it,\nFox gets a little bit of money. They are dramatically less\ndependent on ad revenue than CNN and MSNBC. So the ratings question\nis an interesting one, but Fox's position is different on that. - Another question from Reddit. \"Both sides are the same\", in quotes, is a meme notion that\nhas spread far and wide in American political\ndiscourse on the internet. To what extent do you agree\nor disagree with this notion and why do you think it is so popular? Now, this Reddit comment also says that podcasts like Russell\nBrand and Joe Rogan, or the legendary comic George Carlin, are examples of big\nproponents of this notion, all of which I kind of disagree with. Russell Brand, Joe Rogan and\nGeorge Carlin claim that-- - [David] Say both sides the same. - The same, and use that, you know, all politicians are\ncrooked, and they suck, and this kind of thing. I don't know if that's\ntrue, maybe George Carlin. Anyway, let's leave that aside. - [David] Yeah. - To what degree do you think, do you agree with this notion\nthat both sides are the same, left and right, the crooked\ncorrupt politicians, they do what politicians do? - I don't agree that it's the same. I think there are different\nfactions that like to say that for different reasons. There are some individuals\nwho want to present themselves as kind of being of above the\nfray of partisan politics. And so I call it enlightened centrism. - [Lex] Do you mean that\npositively or negatively? - No, I mean it negatively, yeah. It's a bit of a pejorative. The idea that I am not going to fall for being a Democrat or a Republican. I can see that these are just\ntwo sides of the same coin, equally bad, lying to\nevery, okay, so that's one. It's sort of like it's\npopular at dinner parties in some circles to go, I'm, both all these politicians,\nyou know, left and right. So that's one side of it. The other side of it\nis that it's often used when your side has really stepped in it, it's a popular way to acknowledge that your side has done something wrong, but while framing it as\nit's not uniquely wrong, and it's not worse than\nwhat anybody else does. And I find that it's one of the lamest and most kind of\ncringe-inducing things to hear because of the what comes next. And usually what comes next is\nnot a good accurate criticism of something that took place, and a discussion of how\nto solve a real problem that we have. I find it a conversation stifler. It also is used to kind\nof suppress voter turnout. Not actively, it's not that\nthe people who say that go around saying don't vote. But the idea of course is\nthe more people that believe that it doesn't really make a\ndifference who you vote for, it's going to suppress voter turnout. And I want voter turnout\nto be as high as possible, not as low as possible, so I also dislike it for that reason. - So is it possible to\nsay that one side is worse than the other in modern\ncurrent political climate? - Listen, I'm a person on the left. I'm not pretending to come here as, and not knowing that my view is biased, because I'm a person of the left. If you ask Ben Shapiro, he'll\ntell you something different. I think in 2023, sum total, the influence of the American right wing, if the American right wing were\nto get everything it wants, it would be a horrifying reality. If the left were to get\neverything it wants, we'd have to figure out a few things, including exactly how we\npay for certain programs. But they're mostly noble goals. And I believe that they\nare more supportive of an individual self-determining\nwhat they wanna do in life and how they wanna live, and is more in line with the\nidea of freedom and liberty than what the right is\ncurrently proposing. That's my view. And of course people will\ndisagree with me and they, no, we get the freedom and liberty the way that the right wants to do it. Okay, well we can have that conversation. - So I think you've\nimplied in your answer, it was kind of focused on policy. It felt like it was focused on policy. There's other stuff\nthat people worry about. - [David] Sure. - Particularly with the left, what maybe termed, the woke mind virus. - Where have I heard, who's\nusing that term a lot now? I'm trying to think. - I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Not sure where it comes up. But the cultural aspect\nof this, that, you know, if you give a lot of power\nto people on the left, like as you gave as an example, there would be a lot of kind of censorship and suppression of speech, and a kind of dividing up of a society of who's allowed to, basically a reallocation of\nresources, not based on merit, but based on some kind\nof high ethical notions of what is right. And only a very small\npercent of the population gets to decide what is\nfair, what is right, which is, you know. - We already have a small\nportion of the population society and fair, okay. - But I don't know how many\ndifferent ways I can say kind of a negative characterization\nof folks on the left when we're now comparing it just as a, to play devil's advocate. - [David] Sure. - So is that something\nthat you worry about? So setting policies aside, wokeism. - [David] Yes. - How big of a problem is it? - This is a great conversation. So two sides of it. Okay, we have new polling\nthat seems to suggest so-called wokeism is kind of more popular in the United States than anti-wokeism. And I'll tell you what I mean by that. This is the less interesting part, we'll go to the more\ninteresting part in a second. Sometimes what people mean by wokeism is an overreaction to\na perceived injustice that goes beyond what would\nbe fair and equitable. There was this really interesting poll and it asked questions like, for example, do you believe society has gone too far, not far enough, or just\nabout the right amount in dealing with issues\naffecting the trans community? The woke position, which is\nsociety hasn't gone far enough, was far more popular\nthan we've gone too far. Now the right wing media narrative is we've gone way too far,\nthis is out of control. And there are lots of\nother similar answers. It's not a huge margin. A lot of these are like\n58 to 42, 60 to 40. It's not like 90 to 10. But by a small margin, the\nso-called woke perspective, of we actually haven't yet done enough to fix some of these issues\nis a little bit more popular. So if we went back to DeSantis, this is part of why I think\nDeSantis is anti-woke agenda may just be a political misstep. - That's a really interesting result. I wonder how the questions are framed, but it's still interesting, nevertheless, no matter what to hear that, people are, majority of\npeople in America are woke, not in the negative sense of the word. - The poll didn't use the term woke. - [Lex] Right. - This is a critical thing. - [Lex] Let's use the\nterm woke positively. - The term has kind of been perverted. Four years ago when the\nterm was started to be used, I would've said, oh yeah, woke just means like I have become aware of problems that are bigger than any one\nperson can fix for themselves that relate to the system. I think that's what, and we might disagree on which problems fall into that category, but\nlike, it was kind of benign. I think now it just means\nlike outrageously left wing, maybe even with socialist\nor Marxist undertones, it's become a pejorative at this point. - But also like bullies, like people-- - [David] Sure, censorers. - Yeah, but people that go\naround calling others racist sometimes oftentimes without\nany proof or justification. - [David] Fair. - But that's a few folks on Twitter. You're saying like the\npolling is starting to show that like no, there's still, most of Americans still\ncare about these issues and wanna improve, and\nwanna make progress. - I think that's the case and they wanna do it in a genuine way that doesn't suppress or oppress anybody. But now let me get to, like to what degree do\nI think that actual, when it goes too far is a problem? It absolutely exists. We can find instances of\nwhere this exists on the left. I've been told many times that as a Jewish Argentinian\nimmigrant to the United States, I actually don't qualify\nas oppressed enough because Jews are privileged now in the US, and my family had just enough\nmoney to leave Argentine. So there's this kind of like\noppression Olympics thing where I've been told you\ndon't get to comment, for example, like a topic in\nthe Latino community now is, are you familiar with Latinx? Okay, in Spanish, there's\nan analogous movement where words by their nature\nsort of like have a gender. So like the word for friend is amigo, but if it's a woman, you would say amiga. So right from there, you can tell the gender\nthat we're talking about. And if it's a mixed group, you say amigos, it's the male with an S,\nbut it could include both. There's a movement now which\nwants to do away with that and put the letter E in. It's a new word, okay? It's a gender neutral word. Amiges, totally new. I don't like that. And I don't know anyone, no\none in my family uses it. And I think it's kind of\nlike a strange imposition from someone kind of with a\nsolution in search of a problem. I've been told, you\nmoved to the US long ago, and like, your English is\ngood, and like you look white. And so like, you don't\nget to weigh in on that. That I think is an example,\nif I understand correctly, of the type of thing you're talking about. I'm kind of being bullied. I'm fine, I'm surviving fine, but I'm being bullied\nover it and disqualified, and saying, you don't get\nto speak on this issue. All of those example, all of that stuff I am completely against. And I tell people on the left, we're actually hurting our\nown movement with this stuff. I just don't think it's as\nbig as some others believe. - You don't think it's\nan existential threat to our civilization in the west, to west civilization? - No, I don't. And I mean, look, we've\ngot a Biden administration, I see Biden as center left. Those who see Biden as extreme far left, this stuff has played\nalmost no role whatsoever in the first two plus years\nof his administration. - There's people that see him as far left? - There's people on the right who, I mean, Trump says Biden's a\nMarxist Socialist Communist. - I haven't heard that because I don't think that\nwould stick very much. - He said that at every rally, yeah. I'm so jealous that you\ndon't watch these things. - I love how deeply\nresearched you are in Trump. I can only imagine how good\nyour Trump impression is at this point. - [David] It's not very,\nsadly, it's not good. - It's not, all right. - No, but, and I'll say\none other thing on that. You know, take trans, because trans, just to talk about it a little bit, we haven't dealt with it much. The trans issue has become huge, I believe because the\nright is obsessed with it. The right is very much not\nconcerned with gay men anymore. It used to be that gay men, it's like, oh, we have to stop gay men\nfrom adopting, and unnatural, and pedophiles. Now it's trans, it's\ndrag shows, et cetera. I do think that there is\na fair question to say, how do we deal with trans women in a very small short list of sports? That's real, okay? My view though is I go,\nokay, we have all issues. We have issues related to\ngender and sexual orientation. We have issues related to trans. Within that, we have specifically sports. You can eliminate from that, trans men, nobody's worried, right,\nabout women, biological women who are trans. And then when you say, it's only in certain\nsports that it matters. Hey, I'm right there. I think it's a complicated question. I don't know how we deal with it. I would ask leagues that have\nexperienced with this already and whatever. The problem I have is\npretending that the vanguard of left wing politics right now is trying to force\ntrans women into sports. It's like, it's just not the big issue that the right is reacting as if it were. - But perhaps because of the right, it's forcing the left to\ncontinue discussing it. I mean, I feel like it, even in institutions,\neven at universities, it feels like these ideas of diversity, inclusion, and equity are taking some of the air out of the room of what a university should\nalso care about, which is merit. And it feels like reprioritization is going a little too far the other way, meaning prioritizing this kind of amorphous concept\nof diversity is moving away, is giving power to people\nthat don't care about merit and are just wanna bully\npeople with a big stick that says racism, or\nsexism, or anti-diversity. And it kind of suffocates the\npeople that care about merit, about meritocracy, about inspiring people from all kinds of backgrounds to succeed. And it's just, you kind of observe that. I'm sure that happens in\nall kinds of institutions. And the concern, I think the people that\nare concerned about wokeism are concerned about at scale, what impact does that have on a society, when there's so much\nconversation about racism, and a pressure not to talk about merit. Like who's the actual\ngood person in the room, the best person in the room? - Generically, that's a concern to me. The degree to which it's happening\nat different institutions I think, is worthy of exploration. I know people who work in academia that are getting out of academia because they don't like the\nenvironment on their campuses for exactly the reason you're saying. So it exists, there is\nno question about it. I also think that the idea\nof a perfect meritocracy is maybe not necessarily the goal in the sense that when you\ntalk about perfect meritocracy, someone wrote a book about this who I interviewed about\na year and a half ago and whose name escapes me. There are problems with\na perfect meritocracy. I think what we want to do is generate roughly equal\nopportunity for people, understanding that there is going to be an outcome on a gradient or a bell curve, allowing people generally speaking, to determine the path\nthat they want to take and giving them, if it's possible, the ability to pursue that\nwithout suppressing, limiting. I mean this is like relatively\nuncontroversial stuff among, I would argue 95% of the left, with the caveats of what\nyou're talking about, which I agree exist. - And it would be nice\nto know the actual data. Sometimes people blow stuff\nout of the proportion. But it's hard to measure\nhow much self-censorship happens at university campuses. It's hard. - That's true. I think also it's sort of like the pitbull bite stories thing, where when a pitbull bites a person, it's more likely to be reported on because it fits a certain narrative. And there are right wing publications that are very interested\nin making this seem as if it is an epidemic. I'm the first to say it\nis happening to a degree. I don't know the degree\nthat it's happening to. I know a lot of people in academia, only a couple of them\nsay that it's an issue. - Would they say it though,\nif they believed it? - I think they would say it, to me, these are just personal contacts. It's not like I'm gonna go blabbing. - To push back, I kind of agree with you, but at the same time, most, I mean I'm deeply connected in academia, I have huge number of colleagues. Most people self-censor by\nnot thinking about it at all. They're like, screw it. - [David] That's deeper. - Whatever.\n- Yeah. - I'm just gonna focus on\nthe thing I love doing, which is the work. And they don't think about, they basically remove themselves from politics and social issues\nand they just kind of say, I'm gonna do my engineering,\nI'm gonna do my mathematics. - Sure. The problem with that is it's kind of, you can't go anywhere\nfurther to figure it out. It's sort of like, there's this funny clip\nwhere Jordan Peterson says, even atheists are actually religious, they just don't know it. And it's like, it's hard\nto test that, you know? I don't know. Okay, I mean, I don't- But it's a fair point. I mean, there may be some people, if it has become so toxic for some people, they may have repressed it way\ndown into their subconscious, but I don't know how we would know that. - But you know symptoms of it, because when certain people\nspeak up kind of lightly, and then 19 year old or\na 20 year old responds and is outraged, the fact that the administration listens to that 19 and 20 year old, and then reprimands whoever\nspoke up a little bit, that's a really dangerous sign to me. And I don't really care about these, like, so I'm more with you. I don't think it's a big\nissue, but then I notice it. I wonder, wait a minute. Would this kind of environment allow a young Noam Chomsky to be around? Would this environment allow like a, I don't know, like a what\ntenure was designed for, which is to have controversial thinkers, and not kind of weird\ncontroversial thinkers, but really people that challenge things that should be challenged? - Yeah, I sympathize\nwith that significantly. I always try to look at specific examples. And sometimes I'll look at\npeople, I'll ask for them, and people will send me five. And one of them is a\nlegit bonafide example of what we're talking about. And four are kind of like, eh, there was a complaint\nand it was investigated, but the teacher's tenure\nwas never in jeopardy, and I don't know that I chalked\nthis up to a big woke event. What do you think the kind of apparatus of the four year degree in college is going to look like in 20 years? - Oh, that's, I mean,\nwe're like day by day, that seems to be changing with GPT. I don't know if you've gotten a chance to interact with ChatGPT. - Absolutely. My entire show now is written by ChatGPT. - I mean there's, that's partially a joke. - It is only because it\nstopped looking at the internet in 2021. If it was current, I could\ncompletely just tune it out. No, I'm kidding. But it's a fascinating tool. - And it's changing the nature of how we do homework assignments, it's changing the nature of how we learn, how we look up new information,\nhow we explore information, how we care about things\nwe're interested in. I think it, I don't think we'll have value for university degree in\n20 years the way we do now. I just think it changes everything. I think language models, I mean Google search has already, and Wikipedia has already transformed, I would say our civilization. But it's, there was still a\nvalue for basic education. I don't, I think that starts\nto dissipate with ChatGPT. So I don't, I don't know. I really don't think there's a university the way we think of a\nuniversity in 20, 30 years. - I mean, I have a personal interest in it in that my daughter is 10 months old. And I'm doing the 529 account. I'm going through the motions as if. But I also recognize, you know, if she went to the schools I went to just with the rate of tuition increase, you're talking 200K a\nyear by the time she's 18. And what happens with\nwages relative to that? This is like separate from\nthe technological thing. And in my mind I'm thinking, is this going to continue\nbeing the right path? What I would love to see is so many people that I interact with, just by virtue of what I do, have no foundation in critical thinking, epistemology, philosophy,\nmedia or literacy. And if there were some way to make that the core\nof some basic education that everybody's receiving,\nwhich goes beyond, you know, ChatGPT can do so many things, but I've not yet seen good examples of how it can teach you to think. Maybe you have a different\nview on how ChatGPT can teach a user to think. But those skills seem to be so lacking in so many of the people I interact with. If there's any positive change to come from a changing\ndynamic with higher education, I wish it would be to\ngo in that direction. - Well, no ChatGPT is actually much better at helping me think than any educator, even books that I've encountered. Because it's very good at\npresenting the full picture, even better than a lot of\nWikipedia articles, you know, on questions like, did\nthe virus leak from a lab, did the COVID leak from a lab? It just presents to you all\nthe different hypotheses, the amount of evidence available to it. It's like a full calm\nobjective picture of it. There's no partisanship. It's like a really nice list\nof things that's available. - But I guess what I mean is, does it tell you how as a thinking human, you should evaluate the strength of each of the paragraphs\nit presents to you? - [Lex] You can literally ask it. - You can ask it to do, okay, yeah. - And then it's actually a fun, it's fun to ask ChatGPT that question 'cause you'll get good answers. And so you'll basically\nhave a kind of Socratic, like a deep intimate, like great podcast style\nconversation with an AI system every single day for as\nmany hours as you want, especially as it improves as, and as the interfaces\nby which you communicate with the thing improves. So yeah, I think it will do exactly that, which is teach you how to think, because you will offload the\nmemory of facts and equations, and whatever else school teaches you, you'll offload that to AI. And instead you'll be\nusing your human mind, which is what it for now\nat least uniquely good at, which is asking good questions, thinking through the\ncomplexities of issues when there's multiple\nperspectives on it, all of that. - Well then I stand corrected maybe. Then I don't know what college\nis gonna be in 20 years. - Well, but you were sort\nof commenting, I see, to the financial aspect of it. Like why does it even\nmake sense at this point? - [David] Yeah. - I am thinking about the\ntransformative effects of AI and starts to ask, what is even education? - [David] Right. - What are you supposed, what\nis the purpose of education? So one is to give you kind\nof a background knowledge on a bunch of different topics. But the other is to discover the thing you're truly passionate about, and the thing you're really good at, such that you can make money, and you can contribute to society, and have a fulfilling life. - Yeah, and I think and also learning to interact with other people. With how relationships are built, socializing, and so many\nother things as well. - But is that, you know, that is the big value of university. - [David] Yeah. - And maybe should be\ncalled something else. - Can you get that for less\nthan 200K a year somewhere else? Yeah, no, it's a fair question. - [David] Kind of social club. - And you know, one of the\nthings I think about also is, people who are well connected, I mean this has always\nbeen, this isn't new, right? But if you're well connected, and you have a sort of drive\ntowards entrepreneurship, and doing your own thing, and you're not pursuing a field that is very licensing-dependent\nlike medicine or law, getting started four years\nearlier with some internships can be a privilege in some cases. But again, that path is available to the people that would likely do well regardless of whether\nthey went to college. And so it's a very privileged,\nself-selected group anyway. - Another question from Reddit. Ask David to explain why\nAmerican style libertarianism is an unserious philosophy. - I don't know what they mean by American style libertarianism. I've talked before about these\nkind of utopian libertarians where, you know, we have,\nwe don't have police, you just kind of like\nhire a for-profit company if you want protection. And if there's a conflict between two of these\nprivate security companies, then I don't know, you\nfigure it out somehow. - [David] So it's almost like anarchism, so take it to that degree. - Yeah, if by, I don't know\nwhat the question means by that American style libertarianism. But in general my problems\nwith libertarianism as it is often presented, come from the work of sociology\nas well as human psychology. Which is the reality\nthat once you get a group that's bigger than 150 people, you really have to start\ncentralizing some decisions. Unless you're gonna subdivide\nthe 150 endlessly into 275s that now no longer have contact, but then that's not really\none society, now it's two. I've not seen good evidence. And I've read a fair bit about this, that once you get beyond 150, you can keep all decisions decentralized. And once you say some things\nneed to be centralized, then it's a matter of how you do it. And it's going to be some\nversion of government that conflicts with\naspects of libertarianism. - Well it could be companies, right? It could be more market-driven, which is the idea of\nanarchism that you're not, you don't give any centralized entity a monopoly over violence. You know, and then if you think that the markets are\nefficient at delivering, especially in this 21st\ncentury and beyond, where a market could have\nperfect information about people. So one of the issues is that\nyou can manipulate markets because there's not perfect information. But now in a digital age, we can be higher bandwidth\nparticipants in the market. So if you're choosing between\ndifferent security companies, are you choosing between\ndifferent providers and different services, you could do so more\nefficiently and more effectively in the digital space. So you could kind of imagine it, but we haven't successfully\ndone it without governments. - Yeah, and I think there's a practical, once you get beyond 150, you also start specializing. It just is a matter of fact. You don't have, everybody\nisn't growing their own food. Some people grow the food and\nother people do other things. And you come across a lot of the problems that started at the\nagricultural revolution. And whether you say that it's a company that's solving it or a government, the problems are going to be very similar. And I've not read anything\nthat to my satisfaction explains how you deal with that. - Well there's underlying\nprinciples of libertarianism, which is putting priority at the freedom of the individual, right? And that's a compelling notion. - Yeah, whenever I do these\nvarious political compass things that put you on two axes, on the authoritarian libertarian axis, I am way down on the libertarian\nside as a left libertarian. So my tendencies are\nalways anti-authoritarian, and towards that option\nwhen it makes sense. So I sympathize with that a lot. - Another question from Reddit. Ask David what issues he\ndisagrees with you on. Is there something you-- - I have no idea. - Okay, that's good. There you go, there's no issues. Perfect agreement. - What's your view on Tesla? - That's a good opportunity to ask. What do you think is strengths\nand weaknesses of Elon Musk? You mentioned Twitter. Have you paid your $8? - I have not paid my $8. I don't see the point in paying for it. I have no problem paying for services. I use a ton of services. I'll try the free, I'll go to the paid. Right now, so the way I used\nto use the Verified feed was I would post a tweet, and then the next day when I, you know, review what's going on on my social media, I would look at the replies to the tweet, which would give me a mix of replies from verified and unverified people. But then I would also look at the verified and see who that are verified public folks have responded to me, or maybe I wanna engage with\nor whatever the case may be. I don't even understand why I would look at the\nVerified feed anymore. So I never do because it's\nrandom folks who I don't know. And it sort of lost its utility to me. And then-- - Oh yeah, sorry to interrupt. But the idea is if everybody\nwho's human pays the $8, it shows to you that it's not\nbots, it's at least humans. - From the reports about\nthe number of people that have bought the blue check mark, I think we may be a thousand\nyears from enough signups in order to make that\nsort of like a reality. - That was the idea.\n- That was the idea. It's an interesting idea. Honestly from my experience, obviously I was seeing all\nsorts of attack comments, some of which were, I'm sure from bots. But I'm ignoring all of\nthose comments anyway. So it really didn't affect\nmy experience that much. I mean here's the thing\nabout Elon and I say this, people sometimes are like, David, you obviously hate Elon\nor you obviously love Elon. I was an investor in\nTesla starting in 2015. I've since sold all my shares. Great run. I'm on my second Tesla right now. I probably won't get a third one because I think that\nelectric vehicle technology is now maturing such\nthat when my lease is up, I'm gonna have many more options with the range and charging\nnetwork, that's important to me. But I could be wrong. Maybe, you know, I don't know. I have no, the cults of\npersonality around people, they mean nothing to me. So for me it's just\nlike people are people. Nobody has only good ideas. Fine. I think that what Elon Musk did accelerating and pushing forward the battery and electric vehicle\ntechnology is unbelievable. It's a one person wrecking\nball in the best sense of saying we're not gonna slow play this and do okay, now Toyota,\nhasn't actually entered, but now whoever, we've\ngot a 90 mile range car, and next year it'll be 110. And it's just like we're\ndoing this right now, you can compete or you can opt out and look at what's happened. Fantastic. On the Twitter side of things, I don't really get the whole plan. I don't know if it started\nmaybe as kind of a goof of some kind and it developed into, I guess I have to buy it. And I think something\nabout it ended up with, there was a clause invoked where I think he did try\nto get out of buying it but then was forced to to some degree. - Yeah, he was forced. - The way Twitter used to\nwork was you followed people and when you looked at your feed, you either saw the posts from\nthe people you were following in reverse chronological order, or posts from the people you followed algorithmically tailored to what you're most likely to wanna see. And if you didn't follow someone, you generally wouldn't see their posts unless it was like a sponsored tweet, or someone you follow quoted\nor retweeted them, fine. The For You feed, TikTok I believe first had\na so-called For You feed. The idea is this is stuff you might like based on, I don't know what, either demographic data about you, your other habits, whatever. And so it's useless to me. It's just basically\nmostly right wing content that is not interesting to me. - Why do you think that is? I mean, so the signals that are used to generate the For You page\nis looking at all your likes, all your comments, all your\nblocks and mutes and all that. It should-- - [David] You know that, I mean, I don't know what it's looking at, okay. - So it's supposed to be\nvery pleasant for you. - I'm sure other people go, wow, this For You thing is awesome. And I'll get like, if you had insert some\nrightwinger sitting here, they would go Twitter used to\nsuppress right wing voices, and now finally they're\ngetting the fair shake that they deserve in the For You feed. Okay, I mean. - I wonder if there's left wing folks setting their feelings of Elon aside that are enjoying the For You page. That's a really important question 'cause it's supposed to be, people on the left and people on the right should be enjoying the For You page. - Sure. Yeah, I mean, so for me, my thought on Elon is\nsome incredible successes. I don't know about Twitter. I do think that, I don't\nbelieve Elon is a right-winger, and when you see interviews with him, certainly at least socially,\nand in many ways culturally, seems very moderate or\neven somewhat on the left in my experience. So I don't think it's\nElon's a rightwinger. I don't, that it's not\nan interesting critique. It does seem though that\nthroughout the Twitter escapade, he certainly ended up\ncloser to some voices that may be influencing\nhim in a particular way that's giving some people\nthat impression, you know? But as far as like the\nElon hate or the Elon love, it's just a person who's\ndone some interesting things, some of which I like and some of which I could\nkind of leave aside. - I have seen folks be\ndrift towards the right more in response to just the\nviciousness of attacks from the left. - [David] Hmm, like who? - Well Elon and-- - So you do think he's\ndrifted towards the right. - So I don't think at the core,\nbut I think on the surface. - [David] Okay. - And I think Joe Rogan\nhas as well on the surface, 'cause I think, so maybe\nyou can correct me, but it feels like people on\nthe left attack more viciously. - That has not been my experience. - Oh it hasn't? No, so yeah, let me know because my sense was that\nthey attack people on the left viciously as well. Left attacks its own, because you're not progressive\nenough, you're not, you know, it is just this kind of bullying that happens very intensely. - No you're 100% right that\nwhen the left has attacked me, it's almost as vicious as\nwhen the right attacks me. The difference in my experience is, it's a smaller contingent on the left that's willing to levy\nthose attacks against me. But I'm on the left. So to some degree you could say, well, that's to be expected. There is toxicity on the left. - But it's intense, isn't it? Like, and that's what I mean, like the attacks on people\nwho are on the left, just you're not left enough. - Yeah, that's, no, that's the-- - [Lex] And it is a\nsmall number of people. - I can't deny that that is\nabsolutely a real phenomenon, and depending on what sort of\ntopics you take on publicly, you are going to suffer the wrath of that to a greater or lesser degree. But with all of these things,\nwhat I always go back to is, you know, I probably would\nhave more disagreements with Rogan today than the\nlast time I was on his show, which was like at the\nbeginning of the pandemic. But there would be zero, and I've done clips critical\nof things that he has said, substantive, of course. To me it's sort of like, oh yeah, I could sit down with\nhim and do a podcast, and it would be zero big deal. And I would tell him, I stand by everything I\nsaid about what you said, and I would say it to you right now. There are people who write to me and go, oh man, things must be\nreally, really tense now. If you were to, Rogan\nwould never have you on because you disagreed, and it's like-- - [Lex] He loves you. - I'm sure he's just not thinking of me. I'm not the most important\nthing to Joe Rogan. I think both of us would\nbe able to sit down and talk about every one of my criticisms. It would not be taken personally, and then we would move on\nand it would be the next day. - You get attacked a lot. How do you not let that\nbreak you mentally? - Oof, I don't know. So let's see. I try to, I mean, I'm in a toxic space. The news in politics,\npartisan news in politics, partisan news in politics on the internet with a social media component, just completely and totally toxic. From a personal perspective,\nwhen I'm done producing my last show of the week until Monday, I try to completely tune out from news and politics altogether, and also make an effort to\njust not look at feedback and what's going on. I also really limit my visibility. I don't need to read every comment. I don't need to look at\nevery email or every tweet. I have 15 minutes each day where I go through my\nsocial media platforms, look at generally what\nhas the reaction been, maybe include that in my assessment of how I want to tackle a certain issue if I missed a good point\nor something like that, and basically try to move on. When something like we talked about at the beginning happens,\nit becomes obsessive. I mean, it's unhealthy, right? Where I'm going, oh my God,\nwho's attacking me now, and scrolling? It becomes, you know, I'm\nsweating, it's horrible. But I think just like\nlimiting exposure to that, and remembering that it is\nimpossible to please everybody. And so I'd really rather have\nfresh, genuine views each day rather than views that are sort of like restricted and flattened by what I perceive to\nbe people's preferences. - So just can you speak a little more to the full process of\ncreating the David Pakman Show? Like what, you wake up because you're\ndoing five shows a week? - I have the Letterman schedule, which means I do five shows in four days. I shoot Monday to Thursday,\nbut we're doing five episodes. Basically our guests,\nwe schedule in advance. I'm picking six to eight\nstories each day that are, like I said, a blend of stuff I think\nwill be interesting, things I want to talk about,\nand things where there's, it's being discussed at one layer and I want to go deeper on it, and I feel like I'm able to do that. I choose those stories in the morning, record in the early afternoon, and we put the show out by that afternoon. - What's the preparation, what's\nthe, how do you take notes? Are you on a sheet of paper? - No sheets of paper anymore. I used to do sheets of paper. I found something about it, like at work, the tactile nature of it. It became inconvenient for\nsharing the notes with my team. But basically we use a wiki type system. It's called Media Wiki, which is basically like a Wikipedia clone. - [David] Old school. - Yeah, old school. So we can have pages for\nevery guest, every topic. - [David] Oh, that's interesting,\nI haven't heard that. - Yeah, I don't know\nanyone else who's using it. It works really well. It's so fast and it\ntakes up almost no space. So it just is a really good tool. When my team, you know, when we book a guest and they\nhave notes from the publicist, they'll put it in there,\nand then I can access it. So I'm basically working off\nof notes rather than a script. I'll pull any audio\nvisual stuff that I want so that that's available. And it's, I mean it's\nreally a very seamless, you know, we're doing this\nevery day, four days a week. And so we have it down\nto a well oiled machine. - Where do you get ideas from? - Everywhere. I have a bunch of subreddits that I follow that I think are talking\nabout interesting things. I have a curated list for\nwhich I still use Twitter, and it is very good for this. It's a curated private list of journalists that I think are doing interesting work. So I'll see what's there. Look at the sort of standard\nnews reporting wire services, AP and Reuters. Glance at what everything\nfrom Drudge, to CNN, to whoever is covering that day. Look at Google News. - How do you try to fact\ncheck stuff on your show? So like is there sources\nor is there a process? - I always try to get to a\nprimary source first and foremost for the facts of the story. And then I'll use other tools\nfor background research. Oftentimes Wikipedia's footnotes,\nI find to be useful tools. ChatGPT is a good one. You really have to fact check it, but it'll give you ideas of\nwhere to do the fact checking, which I think is fantastic. Sometimes it gives me information\nthat's flat out wrong, and when you ask for the source, it's like, oh yeah, that\nactually is not real, which is, hey, it's part of the process. But, and then when there's like\nan expertise type of thing, if it's a breaking legal matter, I'll just call like a\nfriend who's a lawyer, or call a friend who's a\ndoctor or something like that if it lends itself to that. - Let me ask you about\nthe nature of truth. Do you think it's becoming\nmore and more difficult to know what is true, and will become continuously, continue to get more\ndifficult, especially with GPT? - I think the big difficulty\nis in getting people to agree as to what is a statement of fact and what is a statement of opinion. I think once we can do that, reasonable people can more or less agree on how to get to the truth. Or if we can't get to it, at\nleast figure out how we would if the information were available. But the bigger challenge I'm having is, someone will call in with an opinion, but say they want to talk about fact, and I have to explain to them, you're talking about an\nopinion and not a fact. And this goes back to the\nlack of critical thinking and lack of media literacy. But that's the bigger\nchallenge for me right now. - But I mean, I think the big statements are always gonna be somewhat opinions. Like was the 2020 election fair? I think any answer to that is an opinion. - [David] I disagree. If we define fair. - Well, yes, so then I don't think it's possible to define fair in a way that's not several paragraphs where each sentence it\nnow has facts, right? So you what do you mean by fair? Is it who could show up to vote? What was the process of\nhow easy it is to vote? Was there actual cheating\ngoing on in different, like what is the evidence\nof that cheating? You have to actually get to the actual like details of a thing. High level, you know, everything is just going to\nbe an opinion it feels like. And you can approximate that to be, like it's a well-founded opinion. Well, most of science is an opinion, even physics is an opinion. So like, I think there's a\nthreshold beyond which an opinion becomes like, uh, this is\na pretty reliable thing to assume for now that that's just true. - Okay, so let me revise. So I think maybe better said,\nI think that the difficulty, I mean, the process you described is probably the right process, and is it's exhausting for mundane things. And that causes major problems. If we were to say, is it better for the economy to have a tax rate on people\nmaking over a million dollars, that's 20% or 50%. Okay, what do we mean by\nbetter for the economy? It's not an overwhelming\ntask to decide on that. We could say, well, we'll say\nit's better for the economy by looking at what was\nthe unemployment rate based on the tax rate on million, you know, people earning a million a year, and what was GDP and whatever. Okay, we've agreed. This is a statement, we are now in the realm of\njust determining what is given the parameters\nthat we've established. I think that that's relatively doable. The issue is with the bigger ones, like you're talking about, where what do we mean by a fair election, and fair in whose eyes? And I am with you that it often\ndevolves into a conversation about opinions about what is fair, rather than an ascertainment of the facts. - Yeah, and it feels like maybe\navoiding some of these big, maybe there's some trigger words too, maybe avoiding them allows you to actually talk about the facts, and through that, educate\nyourself and learn about, like whether the virus\nleaked from a lab or not. To me, it was always a\nsuper interesting question. I don't know why everybody\ngot super touchy about it. Mostly people I know,\ncolleagues, biologists thought it's pretty good likelihood that it leaked from a\nlab given everything. They just didn't, the evidence is not there for either one. And so like you should be able\nto just openly talk about it unless you're in a high political office where there could be\ngeopolitical consequences to your statements. But in general, it's an\ninteresting question. You should be able to talk\nabout it, but there's no, first of all, there's not many facts\naround there, unfortunately. And a lot of very\nconclusive statements about, especially in the early\ndays, were just opinions. And so you have to, the\nidea of what is true or not becomes a little, even mentioning the word\ntruth in that context, it feels divisive. - Yeah, I completely agree\nwith you, which is strange. Like it really, you think it shouldn't. One of the really good opening\nquestions that I've had work to my advantage\nwhen talking with people who I know disagree with me\nabout a contentious topic, is how do you think we would figure out X? And it often gets people\nthinking first collaboratively, and obviously we might have\nvery different opinions, but with something like\nthe COVID lab leak, I think it's an interesting\none because if you say, okay, maybe it leaked, maybe it didn't, how would we figure that out? Who would we trust to weigh in on that? What evidence would count? Now we're kind of on the same team, and then if we can establish that, then we're on a search for capital T truth together or whatever. It's kind of pie in the sky,\nbut in some conversations, I've actually had success with that. - And then you can kind of realize, if there's no amount of\nevidence that's gonna prove, show to you that you're wrong\nin your current opinion, that that's probably a\nreally bad sign for you. - It may be a waste to pursue\nthe conversation further at that point. Yeah, I mean, yeah, what, oh, so okay, you think Trump was a good President. How do you determine that\nand what evidence might exist that would change your mind? There is no evidence. Trump was the best President ever. I think the conversation's probably done. - [Lex] Except Abraham Lincoln. - Right. - You mentioned Israel Palestine. Well, what do you think\nabout the situation in Israel and Palestine, and something you've thought\nabout or spoken about for quite a time. Do you think we'll ever see\npeace in this part of the world? - I don't know. You know, I mean, I could say yes. - [David] It's a synonymous answer. - I could say yes. You know, one of the problems is, and I'll give, you may not know that there are people on\nthe left of my audience who call me a Netanyahu Shill, even though I've never been\na supporter of Netanyahu, and I'm on the left. I just don't think that some of the, kind of black and white\ncharacterizations about Israel are even remotely accurate. And I think most people, it's\nbecome a sort of litmus test. Are you criticizing Israel enough? Are you showing us that\nyou're actually left wing? I don't do any of that stuff. I really look at the\nsituation for what it is. - That's become a litmus\ntest in American politics, in the spectrum of American politics. - Yes. My view big picture, is that I don't think we're\ngoing to really get anywhere until some pre-negotiated terms are set, and the parties to do the negotiating are all good faith parties. For example, I don't think\nIsrael's right wing party, Likud, is a particularly good\nfaith arbiter of peace, because I think Likud benefits\nfrom there not being peace, and the threat of violence. And there is violence, it's not\njust the threat of violence. I don't think Hamas is going\nto be an arbiter of peace for the Palestinian people either. I think the Palestinian\nauthority is a question mark, I'm not sure. So I think that there need\nto be some preconditions that would need to be set with regard to everything\nfrom settlements, to, you know, a lot of this minutia. Big picture though, if I imagine what the most\nlikely solution looks like, it doesn't mean it's a perfect solution. And obviously it's a solution, many people will say\nit's not going to happen. I think it's a solution\nwhere the borders are similar to what was being discussed\nin the Clinton era to some degree, as many of the settlements\nas possible have to go, understanding that some of the bigger ones are just not going to go and there's gonna have to\nbe meaningful land swaps which Yasser Arafat\nseemed to be amenable to when he weighed in on it, I\nbelieve it was in the '90s. The topic of the Temple Mount, and Jerusalem, et cetera\nis a complicated one. But I think that almost certainly, East Jerusalem is going to have to be part of an eventual Palestinian state. You know, I mean like we can go as kind of as far as we want\nto with a lot of this stuff. - What role does us have to play in this, coming to the table\nwith good faith parties? - I don't know whether the, I go back and forth between believing that the US should play a big role, to the US should play\nessentially no role whatsoever, because of course of the funding of Israel that the US provides. It's not that I have a personal problem with American involvement, and somebody like Bill\nClinton was arguably relatively well positioned to\ntry to make something happen. It's more just will there, will it be seen as credible\non the global stage? And that's, I think, the\nmost important thing, because at the end of whatever\nnegotiation takes place, both sides need to agree that this is where we are\nrenouncing all past claims. And in the future, if\nthere's a disagreement, we can't go back to that thing\nfrom the '80s or the '90s. That's just like a critical piece of this. - Yeah, it has to be stable, and you know, materialize into\nsomething stable over years. - Yes. - Another difficult conflict\ngoing on in the world is the war in Ukraine. What do you think about the\nRussian invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022? - I don't pretend to be\nan expert on this issue. I think you probably know\nmore about this than I do, just from the brief conversation we had before we started filming. My view as a general\nobserver of geopolitics and the way that this area, this part of the world has\nrelated to American presidents over the last several, you know, cycles, is I don't think it's controversial to say that this was a war of aggression, an invasion of aggression, an act of aggression by Vladimir Putin. I do believe that if\nTrump had been reelected, Putin may have seen himself as having other tools with which\nto try to expand influence, that may have been different\nthan geographical pursuits, geographic pursuits. But we don't know that for sure. I also have a really hard time imagining what the end of this looks like. And that's very scary, because\nsometimes the most benign end seems to be that Putin\nends up out of power, either through no longer being\nalive or deposed in some way. It doesn't feel like that\nlatter is super likely, the former, there's\nreports about his health, I don't know how accurate they are. It's just hard to imagine\na face-saving exit that is going to be even\nremotely, what's the word? It's not even a question of acceptable, just, it's not satisfying either. Just not tragic, I guess\nis what I'm looking for. - In terms of Putin speaking\nto the Russian people and being able to figure out what to say, what kind of narrative to\nsay why this war made sense. - [David] Yes. - And the same on the Ukrainian side, to figure out how to exit this war. - Yes. I mean, to some degree it\nrequires Russian troops leaving Ukraine, and that is\nsomewhat under the control. I mean, of course it's not up to Ukraine whether the initiative continues, but what I am not thrilled\nwith are some of the reflexive, you know, if Trump had been\nin power instead of Joe Biden, a lot of the reflexive comments about, oh, if you say Ukraine is\njust acting defensively, you're supporting neo-Nazis, or some of these things that have come out of the\nAmerican Republican Party seem both wacky, and like they would be saying\ncompletely different things if Trump happened to\nbe in the Oval Office. They're really proxy attacks on Joe Biden. - Yeah. Well that in some sense, Ukraine is also kind of\npolitical litmus tests of how you speak about it. I think, because of the\nhuge amount of funding that's going from US to Ukraine, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that this topic has become politicized already. - 100%. There are people like Marjorie\nTaylor Greene and others saying, we should be\ndoing nothing for Ukraine. Zelenskyy is a comedian, and\nwe're supporting neo-Nazis. That's it, full stop. And you either subscribe\nto that or you don't. And it very quickly becomes, it very quickly becomes as\npartisan as so many other issues. And it's really, the\nmost disappointing thing is that some of these issues\nbecome incredibly divisive but they're simple. Like for example, a conspiracy theory\nthat we know isn't true. It shouldn't be divisive\nbecause it's so simple. Other issues become divisive,\nand they are simplified, but in reality they're\nextraordinarily complex, and you lose the ability to\ntalk about the complexity because they're becoming partisan. - Do you think there will\nalways be war in the world. There's a bunch of folks on the subreddit that were interested in your\ndifferent complex perspectives on foreign policy. So let's talk about war. You look at the war in Ukraine, you look at what's going\non in Israel and Palestine, you look at the wars across the world. Do you think there will always be war? As a redditor put it, is it a necessary evil in\nthe game of geopolitics? - I used to have what I now believe is an extremely naive perspective, which is that if we somehow, if intelligent aliens arrived here, it would be so momentous for homosapiens, that all of our differences\nwould immediately be exposed to so insignificant. We would never fight again, and we would realize\nthat intelligent life. And then I spoke to people\nwho deal in space exploration and other scientists, and they all said, David, that's extraordinarily naive. There would be a period during which this was as momentous\nas you're imagining, and then it would become normal. And then we would go back to\nmany of the same conflicts that we have now, sectarian, et cetera. I think that in all likelihood, there will always be\nconflict between factions, whether it's what we\ncurrently think of as war, probably not. I mean, it seems as though\nthe tactics will evolve, and it will be less about missiles, and I don't know where it's going to go. I don't know whether it's going\nto become more biological, or cyber, or certainly something we haven't even considered yet. But I think there will always be conflicts we would refer to in that way. - Do you agree with Chomsky on the, his general harsh criticism\nof US foreign policy in war, that many actions, military\nactions in the United States are criminal in nature,\nalmost terrorist in nature? - I am not, it's been a decade or more since I've read any Chomsky, and I don't keep up with everything that he has recently said. So I don't want to\nmischaracterize any of it. - In general, Americans are sold the view that we're the good guys spreading\nfreedom across the world. And I know Chomsky takes\na perspective that, yeah, but if you look at the\nnumber of civilians you kill while doing it, it's incomparable to any\nother military actions across the world. - Right, so I very much\ndisagree with those who take the view that the US is this wonderful global police force that's spreading democracy\nand fixing problems. Very, very much wrong. I think where I've had disagreements with Chomsky in the past is more, he seems to frame the US\nas a uniquely bad actor in some of these cases. And I think it's more an outcropping of the size and wealth of the US, and less about uniquely\nnegative intentions. And so I think that would\nbe my general disagreement with Chomsky based on\nstuff I read a decade ago. - Well, he says that he\nlives in the United States, he's an American. And so he feels his focus of\ncriticism should be on America. And I think that's one of the great things about being an American\nand being in America is the freedom to criticize harshly. - [David] Sure. - While being a university\nprofessor, by the way. He's basically the embodiment of why tenure is a really valuable thing. - [David] I agree. - Whether you agree with him or not. Question from Reddit. Ask David what he plans\nfor his garden this year. Is this a joke or is this-- - It's not a joke. I got into gardening a few years ago. Honestly, I'm with the baby. I can't do a garden this year. And I have a lot of travel coming up, so everything would die. But I did start to try\nto figure out gardening. If you're stressed by the toxicity of the social media world, gardening is a great hobby. It really is. But it is extraordinarily time consuming. So I have no garden planned this year. - Are there books or\nmaybe movies in your life that had a big impact on you, that, you know, you're\nthinking about that diet, has there been stuff you read,\nforget about even just books, like blogs or writers, or\njust sources of information that had, that molded you\ninto the intellectual, into the political thinker that you are? - It's so hard to, this\nis sort of like, you know, you win an Oscar, and you wanna make sure you\nthank all the right people. I read so much and have\nbeen reading for so long that it's really hard to say. But I think certainly for me, narrative nonfiction has\nbeen a fantastic genre to learn not only about history, but also about people and psychology. And very often when people\nsay, I don't really read, like, what can you recommend to me that might be interesting. Depending on, you know,\nknowing them to some degree, I'll give recommendations there. In terms of just things\nI picked up recently that I think are interesting, I've been reading a bunch of Neil Postman, I read a Jenny Odell\nhas a new book on time and the concept of like saving time, spending time, et cetera. She just published it. Super interesting. I just read Lansing's book\nabout the Shackleton voyage in Antarctica in 1914, '15, and '16. Super interesting. I'm really all over the map. - [Lex] I have that one on audiobook I've been meaning to listen to. - It's very interesting\nand it seems inconceivable how these guys survived,\ncompletely inconceivable, and yet they did. - It kind of inspires you to\nthink of space exploration, and taken on similar kinds of\nrisky and dangerous journeys. In narrative nonfiction, I\nagree with you very much. I've been reading a lot\nof 20th century history about Stalin and about Hitler. Rise and Fall of the Third\nReich I've read twice now, and I recommend. - [David] What did you\nget out of reading it the second time? - So what I, so the second time\nI listened to the audiobook as I ran. I get the same thing from it, as I get maybe reading\nMan's Search for Meaning, which is all the troubles of\nday-to-day in the modern world kind of fade away and dissipate\nwhen I'm thinking about the, you know, basically the\nembodiment of evil at scale at that recent time in human history. So it makes me sort of appreciate all the, it fills me with gratitude\nto have all the freedoms, all the just simple joys\nof life that we have today. And I think the second\ntime as I was reading it, because William Shire was\nthere, he's the author, he was there through the whole thing. You start to pick up little details as opposed to like big things. You start to pick up the little\nquirks of how history turns, and just like these little events. You notice of the dynamics\nbetween people in a room during a meeting with Hitler. You just notice these little\nthings that are mentioned, 'cause like he was either there directly or hurted the next day. So you get, that's why to me, Rise and Fall of the\nThird Reich is interesting is 'cause it's by a guy who was there, who's reporting on it, versus a sort of a more\ndistant displaced retaliant. And I also like biographies. I'm a big fan of biographies. And Walter Isaacson has just\nwritten some incredible ones, and Steve Jobs, and Einstein,\nall that kind of stuff. - Viktor Frankl's book is one\nI've read a bunch of times. And it's so short. And you know, reading in general, I know a lot of people who\nread way more than I do, and I also know a lot of\npeople who don't read at all. I mean, they haven't read a\nbook since college essentially. To me, it's almost like\nthe amount I get from it, it's almost like a secret weapon, where when I think, you know,\nin two or three or 400 pages, which I can read in, whatever 10 days, or however long it takes,\nreading 30 pages a day, the amount of information, insights into so many\naspects of the human psyche that I can get. It's sort of like, it's not\nlike I'm in a competition for anything in particular with\nanybody, I just do my show. But it's sort of like, if I'm reading dozens of books a year and you're reading zero, I'm exposed to so many\ndifferent things and ideas that are not even in your universe. It just seems like, the power of reading\njust seems overwhelming. - And I had, speaking of getting attacked, I had a fun time getting\nattacked a few months ago for publishing a reading list. So I'm reading at least a book a week, read 18 or 19 books from\nthe beginning of the year. - [David] You got attacked\nfor the books you chose, or for this-- - I don't know for what. But it would get, became quite viral. - [David] Attacked for reading? That's something. - So it's basically what\nhappened is that people, I actually don't, it's not\nworth folks who know know, folks who don't, don't\neven worry about it. It's the, what I really loved\nabout being attacked for it is it shows you can get\nattacked for anything. - [David] Apparently. - So it's not like I did something wrong, it was kind of a beautiful thing, and it was just the most\nintensely beautiful display of absurdity of Twitter and the internet, that there were articles written about me with the book list. There's no bad books on it. The thing I was being mocked\nfor is reading Dostoevsky, reading stuff that sounds like\na high school reading list. - [David] Oh I see. - Or all these kinds of\naspects of the reading list, which doesn't stand up to any sort of legitimate\nkind of criticism. But the fact that people are\njust looking for single words or single aspects of a tweet\nand so on to criticize is, it actually forced me to,\n'cause I released a video about, you know, summarizing my\ntakeaways from one of the books, and I've been meaning to do more and more. But every time I start\nto like, wanna record it, I have this negative feeling. They kind of ruin the fun\nof sharing with others. - I know exactly what\nyou're talking about. My advice on that is don't do it. Just don't record it. Because, and is that what you basically. - Yeah, for now, but\nI think time cures it. But for now I decide not to. - [David] Yes. - It's just, until I\nfeel joy when I do it. - We are in such a privileged position to even be able to do\nthis sort of thing, right? I have taken on projects, and then it sort of sounds good, or I end up doing it because\nthere's some third party that brings the idea, and I feel like I can't\nreally say no or whatever. And then when I get in\nfront of the camera, or I have to write something, for a while, I did a newspaper\ncolumn that I hated doing. I realized that I'm\nruining the exact thing that I have worked to build, which is that I can\njust do whatever I want. Why am I doing this? And sometimes it takes\nme a week to realize it, sometimes it takes me a year. But just don't do it, that's the path. - In this case in\nparticular, it's also the, there's a private thing I\nenjoy, which is reading. - [David] Right. - And if sharing that private\nthing you enjoy is not fun, then just don't share it. That's, yeah. There's certain things, there's certain private things\nthat should remain private. That's like, which is one\nof the first things ever. I'm the same person\nprivately as I am publicly. But the books, it's like,\nman, I don't get to share, I guess through these conversations I can, I share some of the stuff\nI'm reading and enjoying it, 'cause it sucks. It sucks to get attacked for stuff, and it sucks to get\nattacked for stuff you love. - Yeah, especially reading. I mean it's, you know, that's\nthe bottom of the barrel. I have these ideas where I'll go, you know, maybe for my next thing, I'll go from politics, which is so toxic, I'll go to travel blogging, 'cause there's so many\ntravel bloggers I follow, and there's so many interesting places. And then I go, wait a second, I like traveling and just hanging out. Now traveling is gonna be my job, and now I've gotta bring\ntwo cameras with me, and I've gotta get shots\nand I've gotta film my food. And I'm not gonna do that. I'm just gonna do what I'm doing, but then I'll travel when\nI want to take a vacation. - And of course some of it could be fun. I mean, I have to say,\nwhen I did the one video on a book, 1984, I really enjoyed it. That whole process, it was fun. It was, I don't think I've ever\nthought as hard about a book when I had to make a video about it. 'Cause I had to like,\nyou know, I read 1984, I don't know how many times. Probably five, 10 times, I don't remember. I read Animal Farm way more. But I don't think I was like,\nwhat do I think about like, what are the key takeaways for me? I didn't really know. Like if you asked me what I\nthink about even Animal Farm, 'cause I haven't done that one, and I've read that one, I\ndon't know, over 50 times. It's probably my favorite book. Is like, I would have to struggle. And making a video about it, basically a little mini lecture, forced me to actually have an opinion about the details of it, and to do enough research to think like, okay, what is the historical\ncontext of this book? I mean, it allowed me to say interesting, and to think interesting\nstuff about the book. I found it to be really rewarding to basically the old Feynman thing, one of the best ways to\nlearn is to teach, right? - Yeah, I can't think of one thing I would say about Animal Farm, and I read it again not that long ago, but I don't know what comments are. - You kind of have a generic comment, about like authoritarianism\nand so on, whatever. But there could be interesting\nquirks of the book, and the characters and\nhow corruption happens. You could say all kinds of stuff that it may be contrasting it. Like even with 1984, it allowed me to contrast\nwith Brave New World, and how that 1984 was politicized, and how it's used by the\nRepublican Party after day. Like you could say a\nlot of interesting stuff if you like, think about it, and write it down on a sheet of paper, maybe you don't need to\nmake a video about it. So I found it to be really\nrewarding in general. So I probably will do more\nof it, but not always. Not as a main profession, just like with the travel blogging. - I agree with that. - I mean, you get threatened a lot, you get attacked a lot online. Do you think about your mortality? - Well, the other day\nI went to the doctor, and he said, you know, next physical, we're gonna be talking\nabout a lot of new things. And so I was thinking\nabout it a lot that day. No, I mean it's funny, I like, I recently did\na bunch of estate stuff. - [Lex] Yeah. - And when you have intellectual property, there's a question of like,\nokay, I have my assets. But also if I died tomorrow, especially in a particularly fiery death, my YouTube channel would\nprobably for a while generate more money, because it would be like, oh my goodness, this person died in a terrible. What happens with a future revenue stream and all these different things? And it got me thinking about legacy, and about the fact that people\nwho do this sort of thing, it's kind of a new thing in a sense. And so, you know, if you work at ABC News, at some point you just retire and someone else fills in for you. How does my career wind down given like I don't actually know the answer. I'm not sure. What is it, I just one\nday stop posting videos, but all my content stays up\ngetting fewer and fewer views. Or do I delete everything? Do I, I don't know. What is-- - If you die, I mean,\nso my trip to Ukraine, 'cause I knew I was going to the front, is the first time I did,\nI record a video if I die. And I posted it and I give\ninstructions to folks what to do. And so like there's a closure. - [David] Yeah. - But it's an interesting process. Like what happens to your, at which point does GPT take over and continue tweeting for\nDavid Pakman, you know? - Well, the tweeting I\ncare less about right now, unless Blue becomes\nsomething unbelievable, I'm less worried about Twitter. But some of my audience members\nhave been saying, you know, some of these tools, David,\nare getting good enough, that we could clone your voice\nand also make it match video. And with scripts, you could\njust keep pumping out content even if you were gone. And I said, now that I'm interested in, that I wanna learn more about. - Boy, it's gonna be a weird future. What advice do you have to young folks that are facing this future? - Almost always, it's some\nversion of start right away. And that applies in so\nmany different ways. So if you're thinking about, oftentimes the context is\npeople want to do what I do. And I always say, do not\nsit around for a year thinking about lighting. This is how you never do anything. And dozens of people\nwho I've felt obligated to talk to on the phone because\nof a personal connection, I go through all the advice, and I can tell they're not gonna do it. They just, it's already\nsounding too complicated. And so instead they'll sort of say, well, I gotta get the right\nlighting in the right room and blah, blah, blah, blah. The best thing you can do,\nno matter what you're doing, is just start right away. And that applies in this business and in whatever else you're doing. If you wanna learn a new\nthing, find a new hobby. The ability to get data right away about what's working, what's not working, and whether you even like this\napproach that you're taking is so valuable. And it will allow you to iterate. And the sooner you do it, the cost to a change of\ndirection will also be lower. If there's any, I don't do like self-help or generic advice type stuff, but the one thing that applies\nin so many situations is, just try it right away\nand iterate from there. - Yeah, start today and\nthen do it every day. - Or decide, hey, you know what? I figured out I don't\nactually wanna do it. - Yeah, hence iterate. Well usually you'll discover you do. You think we'll make\nit out of the century, humanity, human civilization? - Out of the, so like to 2100? - Yeah, how much we got? 80 years. - Yeah, 77. I think we're gonna make it. - You think so? - [David] Yeah. - What are the biggest threats\nfacing our civilization, if not wokeism? - If it's not wokeism, it's hard to say. No. I actually think that if you believe that we are on an\ninflection point of sorts in changes to society and\nacceleration of technology, et cetera, I think it's really tough to know in 2090 what will actually be the biggest threat. So, I don't know, it's\nso cliche to say nuclear, and climate change, and another pandemic. - Technologically our world\nmight look so different than it's almost-- - [David] Yes, yes. - Unimaginable. What it means to be human is unimaginable. And also the degree that we\nmake progress out into space is also unimaginable. - I think space is super interesting, and there's people on\nboth the left and right who for different reasons are kind of not into the\nwhole space exploration thing. The people I hear from, the ones on the right think\nit's just kind of dumb. The ones on the left think it's an excuse not to fix problems here. I think-- - And also they say it's the\nplay thing of billionaires. - [David] Sure. - Which is another funny kind of concept. - Yeah, I mean, someone's\ngotta pay for it. Why not be people who have\na lot of money to blow. - It could either be billionaires or governments that are trillionaires. - [David] Sure. - Somebody has to pay for big\nambitious moonshot projects. - To me, the most interesting thing is that in getting closer to the next step of space exploration, we may well learn things that can then be used to\nimprove circumstances here. For me, it's not one or the other. And I recently read a long\npiece about why not Mars? Because it's terrible in\nevery way for supporting life. Okay, so like that's one perspective, but still in so exploring, who knows what we might end up learning. So I'm big on it. I don't share the view of\nsome on the left about it. - So I guess to add to your\nadvice to young people, if a thing seems terrible, you still might wanna consider doing it? - I would say so, yeah. How many things have seen, I mean, listen, there are so\nmany trips where the day before I say, why am I doing this? The jet lag, I've gotta do this and that. And now who, if my guest\nhost falls through. I should just stay in work. And I go, hold on. You do this every time. Just go, you never regret it. You learn something, you try something. I never regret the trip. - This hopefully applies to\nthe conversation we had today. David, I'm a big fan of yours. Thank you so much for talking today. Thank you for being patient with me. We tried to talk earlier. Please continue doing what you're doing. Please continue being objective\nand thoughtful and fearless. - Thank you.\n- On the internet. - Big fan of yours as\nwell, I appreciate it. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Pakman. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Mahatma Gandhi. What difference does it make\nto the dead, the orphans, and the homeless? Whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism, or in the holy name of\nliberty or democracy. Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."

  "full_text": "- I tweet that and then I finish the day and I wake up the next morning\nand I glance at my phone. I'm seeing all these verified\naccounts that are, you know, quote tweeting it, and demanding\na retraction and whatever. And I go, uh oh, okay, this looks like it's\ngetting some attention. I then continue about my day. Around noon, I hear from my\ndad that he got 100 messages, from, \"You should have aborted your son\", to, \"We're gonna find all\nof you\", to whatever else. My dad has no idea what's going on. He's like, I don't know what this is, but I have 100 DMs to\neverything else you can imagine. And I start to get emails about, you know, your Jewish faith, this and\nthat and the other thing. And so at that point, to me, I thought, this is just going to get\nworse and worse and worse. And so I deleted the tweet. And I really regret doing that, because over the 48 hours that followed, yes, the attacks escalated, it went through Candace Owens\nand then at foxnews.com, Newsmax, kind of peaking\nwith, with Donald Trump Jr. And it was horrible. The following is a\nconversation with David Pakman, a left wing, progressive\npolitical commentator and host of the David Pakman Show. I hope to continue to have\nmany conversations on politics with prominent, insightful, and sometimes controversial figures across the political spectrum. David and I have been planning\nto speak for a long time, and I'm sure we'll speak many more times. This conversation was\nchallenging, eye-opening and fun. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,\nhere's David Pakman. Are there interesting differences to you between terms like Liberal,\nDemocrat, left wing, leftist, progressive, socialist,\ncommunist, Marxist, far left, center left, all of these labels? Is there interesting\ndistinctions between them? - Yeah, there's two sets of distinctions. One is if you just want to say, let's define each of\nthese as political terms. They're all different terms. You can be a progressive ideologically but not be a member of\nthe Democratic Party. Many say the Democratic Party isn't even really very progressive. So these are certainly\nterms that we could define in order to have a conversation\nabout the next thing, kind of as a precursor to a conversation. Sometimes the terms are\nused in order to tag someone with a certain ideology that's not really linked to policy or any particular political question, but they can be used\npositively or negatively to just kind of say, here is the image of this\nindividual that I have in my mind. So like Marxist is right now\nvery popularly being used by some on the right to attack Democrats. There's very few actual Marxists, certainly not in positions of\npower in the United States, but even among the general population. So I think it's important to distinguish, are we defining these terms because we want to compare\nand contrast the ideas that a particular group might\nbring to the discussion, or are we using them as insults\nor to stifle conversation? There are terms that can be used to start conversation or to stop it. - And the use of those terms is evolving rapidly month by month. So the term leftist, I think is a relatively popular term now to use in the negative context to describe what an outraged left wing commentator. - I think what you're\nkind of grasping onto is that there's probably some set of ideas that would apply to most of those who consider themselves to be on the left. The discussion of how that\nterm is mostly being used is not about policy ideas. You're accurately kind\nof identifying that. And it does seem like progressive is no longer being used as a smear, and leftist is being used as\na smear more at this point. - Okay, but sometimes some\nof these terms are useful, like can we try to pick\nthe terms that are useful, like Liberal and progressive and Democrat. Liberal and progressive, is there an interesting\ndefinable distinction between Liberal and progressive to you? - That's a maybe one of\nthe most interesting ones. 10 years ago Liberal often meant what now we mean by progressive. More recently, the progressive\nsocialist leaning part of the political spectrum has started to use\nLiberal to mean Joe Biden, to mean someone who is\nnot really left enough. So Liberal's very interesting because I remember talking\nwith my audience years ago, maybe eight years ago\nor something like that, where I identified I'm going to now use the term progressive more commonly to describe my own beliefs, because Liberal has now been made a smear. It's being shifted into something else. And it also means more of\nlike a center left politics. So it's changed in some\nsense by necessity, by force. And also because the spectrum\nhas shifted to some degree. - So the term Liberal has evolved, now Liberal meaning\nsome kind of embodiment of the mainstream Democratic Party almost. - To some degree. Sometimes I'm called, I'm\nwritten off by, you know, within my space, there are\nall sorts of shades of gray, which I'm sure we can talk about, about where I am, versus should be, could be, or am wrongly placed. And sometimes an attack\non me is, he's just a Lib, meaning I'm not left enough,\nI'm not progressive, socialist, wherever else you want to go. So yeah, the problem with\na lot of these terms, and they're used very casually by people who call into my show, is that unless we actually\ndefine them each time, they very often mean very different things to different people, and often come with an\nagenda attached to them. And so I find that they often\nstifle meaningful conversation rather than encourage it. - Hey, do you sense\nthat there's a drifting of what is the threshold\nto be a progressive? Or is there, should we use\nprogressive synonymously with Democratic socialists? - I think we should\nnot use it synonymously with Democratic socialists. And this is where there's\nanother linguistic confusion and a political confusion. So we'll first talk\nabout the linguistic one. Social democracy versus\nDemocratic socialism. Very similar words in a\ndifferent order, okay? The way I operate is Democratic socialism is actually a form of socialism where one would seek\nto socialize ownership of the means of production as an example. Social democracy is a\nvery highly regulated form of capitalism, the likes of which we would see in Northern Europe, Denmark, et cetera. These are very different things. I associate progressivism in\n2023 with social democracy and would consider Democratic socialism a form of actual socialism. That is different. We're no longer talking about\na capitalist organization of society. - So transition from one to the other is a fundamental shift in\nhow society operates then? - Absolutely. And when you talk about social democracy, you're talking about\nsocializing a couple more things than we socialize in most\nmodern capitalist countries. I had this conversation with\nPatrick Bet-David recently. Social democracy is, okay, we've socialized\nthe military already in the United States. We've socialized some\nhealthcare in the sense of like the VA and Medicaid, et cetera. We're talking about socializing\na couple more things still in a capitalist country. Democratic socialism would\nbe something beyond that. And as someone who is not a\nDemocratic socialist myself, I'm maybe not the best\nadvocate for explaining exactly how that system would function, but it would have some version\nof socializing ownership of the means of production\nbusinesses, et cetera. - So you mentioned you\nappeared on the PBD podcast with Patrick Bet-David. The debate was pretty intense. - [David] Was it? - I should say, I personally enjoyed it. I thought actually you did well, and I thought Patrick did well, and it was a good conversation. There was a little bit of tension. - [David] Yeah. - And I thought that Patrick actually, so I disagreed with the internet. I thought Patrick just took\non a kind of devil's advocate. Like he was purposely being stubborn to bring out the best in you. But the internet thought\nthat he's being stubborn, not being open to your ideas. I thought the tension between ideas, I think a lot of the tension had to do probably with Donald\nTrump and Trump supporters. - That certainly could be the case. And people wrote to me the full gamut of everything you can imagine, from this was your best thing\nyou've ever done in public, to you got humiliated and your mother should have aborted you. Okay, so and everything in between. So, you know, take your pick. But the most interesting feedback I got was from people who asked me, after, was it incredibly\ntense and awkward, and because it seemed so combative. And I think for, I'm so used\nto those types of tensions in the discussions that I have that it's very comfortable to me. It's not like afterwards it's, there's a grudge or it's tense\nor whatever the case may be. I'm very comfortable just, I disagree with people and that's it. So I did not find anything\nthat happened inappropriate. I disagreed with a lot of the\nthings he said, certainly. - So you also spoken with Michael Knowles, I think about the idea of what is a woman. Can you speak broadly\nabout your conversations with people you disagree with? You know, some of the cases\nit feels like it's gone wrong. - The conversations have gone wrong. - [Lex] Yeah. - Yeah, I mean, I think there's\na couple different things. And I'm the first to tell you that depending on who I'm talking to, I go in with a different attitude about how, quote, seriously I'm taking it in the sense of whether\nI think it's going to be a deep policy discussion, versus whether it's going\nto be more of a performance for an audience that is\nexpecting a certain thing. And I think there's\ndifferent types of shows. When I was interviewed by this guy, Jesse Lee Peterson in Los Angeles, it's very different, for example, than when I'm talking\nto Patrick Bet-David, just to give two examples. I think the reason I stopped\ndoing the Michael Knowles Show was the number of of threats\nI would get after the fact. That's really the, I was\nglad to engage with him to the extent that the\ninterviews were interesting and, you know, we could organize\nit reasonably efficiently. But the reason I stepped away\nwas sort of the aftermath. But I did find him to be\nsomeone who was abundantly clear about his view and where he comes from. And while I could not possibly\ndisagree more with him in terms of politics and\nculture and our backgrounds, everything is just so different. I found it easy to engage\nin the conversation just because of how\nupfront and clear he was about what his beliefs were. - But the number of\nthreats, it's too much. - Yeah, it was just too much. And this, you know, I don't\nknow if how much you saw about this recent Twitter\ndust up I was involved in that peaked with Donald\nTrump Jr. tweeting about me, and then that then declining from there. - Oh, let's talk through\nit, I didn't see it. - Okay. - I have to understand, like\nthe way you study Shakespeare, I have to study your Twitter. I have to understand how\nmuch of it is sarcasm, how much-- - It's mostly sarcasm. I mean here's the thing, and I know that there\nare people who will say, David, you're dealing\nwith such serious issues, it's really not okay not to take everything you\ndo completely seriously. But my view is, it's so\nincredible that I've, between chance and timing\nand so different things fallen into a position where this is what I do professionally, and it's a career, and it's\nfinancially sustainable and all these different things. I don't wanna end up\ntaking myself too seriously because I recognize the timing and luck and all of these other things. And this could have gone a\ncompletely different way. So my approach to a lot of this is let's not take ourselves too seriously, and in particular on\nTwitter, a platform that, you know, the degree to which it should be taken very seriously maybe\nhas changed over time. I'm always sort of thinking\na little bit tongue in cheek on Twitter. - So what happened with Donald Trump Jr.? - [David] So. - Or the full arc of it. - Yeah, to give you a one minute arc and then we can pick\nwhichever parts we want. After a mass shooting, now you might say there's\nlike two or three a day, you're correct. After the Nashville mass\nshooting at a Christian school, I tweeted snarkily, tongue in cheek, to point that thoughts and prayers not only aren't particularly\nuseful after a shooting, they also don't prevent shootings. That there's some confusion about how there would be a\nshooting at a Christian school given that it is a place\nwhere prayer is taking place. I think, you know, jokingly\nsaid something like, were they not praying enough or correctly? - In my deep journalistic integrity. - You have it. - I have your tweet. - [David] Beautiful, beautiful. - This is the only display\nof journalistic integrity I will show today. Okay, and then I have\na couple of responses. - [David] Beautiful. - And you deleted the tweet since then. - Which I regret. - Oh, interesting. - [David] And we can talk about that. - Well I would love to because it's such a interesting decision, because when you tweet something, one of the things I've also learned is you don't often understand\nhow it's going to be read. It's going to be analyzed,\nlike I mentioned, Shakespeare. Like there's certain, the use of certain words\nthat you regret saying in a certain kind of way, maybe just 'cause it wasn't\nas eloquent, as powerful. It didn't actually convey the thing, or is the distraction to the main message, all that kind of stuff. Okay, the actual tweet is, \"Very surprising that there\nwould be a mass shooting at a Christian school, \"given that lack of prayer is often blamed \"for these horrible events. \"Is it possible they weren't\npraying enough or correctly \"despite being a Christian school?\" And a lot of people quote retweeted that, which I'm assuming was criticism. So Colin Wright wrote, \"I used to consider you\na reasonable progressive, \"but you clearly devolved\ninto partisan hackery. \"I'm an atheist. \"It cannot begin to fathom \"using the murder of children and adults \"at a Christian school as an opportunity \"to dunk on the concept of prayer.\" And you responded, \"I'm dunking on the people\nwho send thoughts and prayers \"and do nothing else, and\nthe shootings continue.\" Okay, I'm sure there's a\nlot of other interactions with this. - There's a few other a\nhundred thousand interactions. So do you want the arc\nleading to the deleting of it? - [Lex] Yes, please. - So basically-- - [Lex] I just wanted to display-- - Do you know what time of day\nI tweeted the original one? I feel like it was in the\nafternoon or evening on a Monday. - 3:42 PM on 27th, March 27th. - Which was a Monday, okay. So basically I tweet that\nand then I finish the day. - So you tweet, and then\nyou go on with your day. - I might have looked once at Twitter, and it had 2,000 likes\nand a few people saying, eh, this might have missed the mark. But it's sort of like, it's\none of my 20,000 tweets, I don't know. I wake up the next morning, my baby daughter did not sleep till 7:30 the way I would like, so she's up at 6:00 AM, and I get up, and I'm just there\nstarting to make breakfast. And I glance at my phone,\nand I'm starting to, this was when verified\nmeant a different thing than it means now. I'm seeing all these\nverified accounts that are, you know, quote tweeting it, and demanding a retraction and whatever. And I go, uh oh, okay, this\nlooks like it's getting, looks like it's getting some attention. I then continue about my day. Around noon, I hear from my\ndad that he got 100 messages from, \"you should have aborted your son\", to, \"we're gonna find all\nof you\", to whatever else. My dad has no idea what's going on. He's like, I don't know what this is, but I have 100 DMs, to\neverything else you can imagine. And I start to get emails about, you know, your Jewish faith, this and\nthat, and the other thing. And so at that point to me, I thought, this is just going to get\nworse and worse and worse. And so I deleted the tweet. And I really regret doing that. Because over the 48 hours that followed, yes the attacks escalated, it\nwent through Candace Owens, and then at foxnews.com, Newsmax, kind of peaking with Donald Trump Jr. And it was horrible. I mean thousands and\nthousands of the, okay. But once I told my audience\nabout what happened, I got thousands of messages\nfrom people saying, David, only someone who doesn't know you and is determined to interpret this in the worst possible faith would think you're blaming\nkids who died for getting shot. Of course you weren't doing that, I wish you hadn't deleted it,\nso that it would still be up and you would now see the\ntide kind of turning on it. This was not a fun three days regardless, but I do regret having\ndeleted it because it was a- I wanted to do the quickest\nthing I thought I could to get people to stop trying\nto find family members and send them threats. And so around noon, that's what I did. And the truth is the\nthreats didn't stop anyway, 'cause everybody had screenshotted it. And I do wish I had left it up. - And is there some degree,\nmaybe stepping outside yourself, do you regret tweeting that, in that it feeds the mockery\nengine that fuels Twitter? So like, does that tweet really\nrepresent what you believe? - It absolutely represents\nthe disgust with politics that includes saying we can't\ntouch guns, we just, we can't. But we're willing to\npoint to mental health, or say we need more prayer\nin schools or whatever. 1000% it represents that view. Is it the type of snark and\nsarcasm that I would use if given an hour to discuss the topic rather than whatever\nthe number of characters is now on Twitter? No, definitely not. And so I am very cognizant of the fact that it was unnecessarily\nprovocative how it was written. - I think I asked similar\nquestion to Ben Shapiro. Do you worry that this\nstyle of presentation can turn you from being, you\nknow, a deeply thoughtful, objective political thinker, to somebody who is just a partisan hack? Or partisan, what's a\ngood word, talking head? - Do you mean with regard to Twitter, or the format of my show in general? - So Twitter for now, let's\nstart with Twitter for now. And can you silo your style\nof communication on Twitter from being a virus that affects your mind? - Right. I don't have deep thoughts\nabout the Twitter component, beyond, I think across\nall sorts of disciplines, this is not the best way to\nmost effectively solve problems and figure out solutions\nto complex issues. - [Lex] You're talking about Twitter? - Now, right now I'm\ntalking about Twitter. That being said, I think all of us to some\ndegree have to adapt our content to the platform that we're using, in the same way that\nwhat I post to YouTube is different than what I post to TikTok. What I post to Twitter is also different. Do I think Twitter has been an\nunmitigated good for society? No. Have I chosen to step into Twitter as one of the ways in\nwhich I get my message out with the good and the bad? Yes. And I think that there\nis a deep conversation to be had there. I think zooming out a little\nbit in terms of what I do, and I was hoping this would come up because I think it's really interesting. I will often get emails from\npeople who say two things. I will get the, you would\nhave such a bigger audience if you did X type emails. And usually they are\nplays to sensationalism, salacious and titillating content, more pop culture stuff, et cetera. On the other hand, it's folks who say, listen, what you're doing\nreally isn't as serious as it could be, and it seems like you could\ndo something more serious, and you should consider doing deep dives. You know, once it was, do a deep dive into Calvin Coolidge, and I was like, nobody will watch that. So it's not by accident that my show is the way it is, right? In an hour, I'm thinking of\nall the platforms I'm on, and I'm saying, okay, I wanna\ndo a relatively deep dive on the federal budget, and I want to talk about some of the political tomfoolery going on within the post office. And I'm gonna do a segment\nabout the wacky rally where Trump said crazy things and made up three words and\nsaid he endorsed a candidate who's named it, right? I'm crafting that in\ntotal to find a balance between let's build this\naudience as much as I can in order to have a bigger base,\nto get my message out there, and include the more serious stuff with the hope that there's a little bit of something for everyone, and I'm finding a balance between those two sides of the spectrum. It's a deliberate thing. And I'm aware that if I were\nproducing my show 50 years ago, the balance would probably be different, and it would probably change again. If we didn't, if the show was audio only, rather than having all\nthese video platforms, it would also be different. But it's a decision\nthat's proactively made to try to get the best\nand most out of the hour that I'm creating every day. - Well it just feels like\nthere's an entire machine fed by Twitter and journalism\nthat wants to divide people. And the drama of that division, highlighting the partisan division, the drama of that division\nfeels like it's a tension with objective, clear thinking sometimes. And so that's the, I worry\nthat there's a drug to it. There's too much fun to\nmock ridiculous people on the other side. - I think you're right about that. And the fact that that is true, to me supports, I've talked\nwith my audience about, you know, like the old food pyramid, which I guess was like wrong, but let's imagine that there\nwas a pyramid that made sense. - [Lex] What's at the bottom, bread? - I think like whole grains maybe? I don't remember, it's been a while-- - Sugar is on the top. - Junk food is at the very top. I'm very open with my audience. The vast majority of what I\ndo is the top of that pyramid. And I tell people very openly, I don't consume a lot of the\ntype of content I produce. And I think it's really important to, as a base, be doing critical\nthinking, epistemology, how do we believe the things we believe, basics about the world. After that, reading history,\neconomics, philosophy, et cetera. After that, now we're\ngetting into current events. I would mostly be looking at consuming primary source reporting, things like Associated Press, whatever. I know everybody will\nhave a different list of what counts there. After that is when I'd say indulge in some of the commentary\ntype stuff that I do, if you find that I'm thoughtful\nenough to make it into that. But I'm very open and\nreally what I try to do on my show often is in being that at\nthe top of the pyramid, tell people there's all this other stuff that should be forming your foundation, that I hope you're consuming in addition to just watching me. And I'm very open with\nmy audience about that. - What about the shape, the dynamics, the characteristics of your audience? Is there some degree to which\nyou're, through mocking, maybe Republicans, that there's\na lean to that audience, and then you become\ncaptured by the audience? Do you worry about the audience capture? - I worry about it. I'm relatively comfortable that\nit's not shaping the program to a great degree in the sense that at this point, I have a pretty good sense\nof the things I can say that will upset what I\nmight call my core audience. You know, one of the interesting things, just to briefly go back\nto the Twitter thing was, those people who were\nfurious with me on Twitter, and they contacted my advertisers, and some advertisers dropped\nme, and on and on and on. None of them are actually in my audience. None of them are regular\nconsumers of my audience. They were kind of weaponized against me by people who said, hey, look at this. The people who follow\nCandace Owens on Twitter, other than for their kind of shock value, they're not in my audience. And with my core audience, I know there are things I can talk about that will generate displeasure, I guess you could say with my audience. Sometimes when I touch the\nIsraeli Palestinian conflict, that will happen. Sometimes on vaccines, there's\na portion of my audience that is more generally\nskeptical of vaccines. Sometimes on some foreign\npolicy issues, or you know, I'm not a big fan of Marianne Williamson nor Bobby Kennedy Jr's\nchallenges to Joe Biden, not because I love Joe Biden, but because I don't consider them to be the most serious challengers. I know there's people I know my audience who don't like that, they\nget mad at me about that. And I'm totally okay with that, and that tension with my core audience. So in that sense, I don't feel as though I've\nhad that audience capture take place, but I know it can happen, and I'm very open to to being told ways in which it may be happening\nwithout me noticing. - So I've made a call\nfor questions on Reddit for this conversation. There's a lot of good questions\nthat I'll probably bring up, but one of them was about\nMarianne Williamson, asking why David thinks\nshe's a garbage candidate, which of course-- - I've never said. - But perhaps you have\nmore eloquently criticized. So let's go there to the 2024 election. - [David] Okay. - So Biden, Joe Biden officially announced that he's running again. Donald Trump officially announced\nthat he's running again. If that's the matchup,\nwho do you think wins? - If the election's held today? I think Biden. - Why? - Well first of all, I\nbelieve he won last time. And if I start with the results from 2020, and I think to myself what\nhas happened since then that would push or pull\nvoters one way or the other, I have a hard time making a case that Trump is in a better position today than he was in November of 2020. So that's kind of my starting point, which is it's a rematch of an\nelection with a known outcome. What has changed? And I can't make a case for\ncircumstances having changed in Trump's favor. To give a couple of state level examples, Florida seems to be kind of moving more to the Republican side since 2020, but Trump won that state already in 2020. So it wouldn't really change the outcome. Arizona was close. I think Arizona has moved\nto the left since 2020. So I don't see Trump taking that one. Wisconsin, I think the\nsame sort of thing applies. So being very like practical, that would be kind of the\nstart of my reasoning. - Do you think Joe Biden\nis a better candidate now than he was in 2020? - I think he's a worse candidate. This is going to sound ageist, but I think he's a worse\ncandidate in that he's even older and there already seems to be an appetite for younger candidates, particularly on the\nDemocratic voting side. So he's going to be four years older, and in a sense that could be a liability. However, he also is going to have four years of accomplishments. Now, you might not like\nthe things he's done, in which case that would hurt him, but he has started to accumulate a not insignificant\nnumber of accomplishments. Some of the big things that are known, Inflation Reduction Act, and\nCOVID stimulus, you know, but also less well known things, like a bunch of little\ntweaks to healthcare, a bunch of little tweaks\nto student lending. There's been a lot of little things. At the macro level, I don't\nactually think Joe Biden has that much to do with this, the same way I didn't\ncredit or attack Trump for a lot of the macroeconomic stuff, but inflation has started\nto come down significantly, the stock market's quite\nsteady, these sort of things. I think looking historically, it's a pretty okay\nenvironment for Joe Biden, with the exception that he was\nalready the oldest President to be inaugurated in 2021, and he would beat his own\nrecord in January of 2025. And I just don't know how\nvoters are gonna see that. - So in terms of just\na public human being, how would you compare Trump and Biden? So if I were to give\ncriticism towards Trump, it would be that he's chaotic, maybe to the point of being disrespectful to a lot of different groups,\nto a lot of different ideas, to a lot of different nations and leaders and all that kind of stuff. And then the criticism towards Biden would be that he, maybe\nperhaps because of age, or any other kind of\ncognitive capabilities is not really there mentally as a, you know, in the way that\nperhaps you could say like Barack Obama was there. Just mentally being able to\nhandle all kinds of aspects of being a public representative\nof a nation to the world and to the people of that nation. So, which, in the competition\nof personality flaws, which do you think is more powerful? - You've laid out fair, and I\nbelieve accurate assessments of elements of both of those men. You haven't weighed in on to what degree you value each of those assessments, which is where I think the kind of meat of\nthis question really is. I don't see, and I know that, you know, Biden's gonna get us into World War III, World War III doesn't\nseem to be happening. I don't see the Biden deficits you listed, which I agree with you on. I don't see them as\ndangerous or threatening to the standing of the United States in this kind of environment with our traditional western\nallies and geopolitics, et cetera, in the way that the sort of\nunhinged personality of Trump, combined with his lack of\nknowledge about most issues is a threat. So for me, if those\ntwo are the candidates, Biden would be my choice. Now, are there people I would rather see on the Democratic side? Yes. If I knew the President\nwould be a Republican, can I think of better options than Trump? Absolutely. You know, it's so funny, when in 2012 it was Obama versus Romney, the difference seemed so\nsignificant between them. Thinking back, I'm sure I\nwould disagree with Mitt Romney about tax rates and his\nviews on LGBT are, I'm sure, I know are different than mine. But it seems without looking at him with rose colored glasses, so comparatively benign given\nthe four years of Trump. So that's kind of where I come down. - Even McCain and Obama, the differences seemed quite drastic. - Yeah. McCain was interesting because\nPalin, as his running mate, opened the door to the\nsort of cartoonish stuff that we've started to see\non the Republican side. Palin, Trump, Marjorie Taylor Greene, it started going in that direction, which has made the party a bit of a joke, aside from what you believe\nthe tax rate would be, right? You can say taxes are too high, but Jewish space lasers come on, you know? So, but I agree with you on McCain also. - So going back to the\npolitical terms we talked about, where in that spectrum do\nyou place yourself today? Which of the label do you think captures your political views? - Progressive Social Democrat,\nwhich, again is a capitalist. I own my own business. I pay the taxes I'm\nlegally required to pay and not a penny more. And, you know, all those things, that's where I place myself. - Would you place yourself to the left of Joe Biden for Senate? - Yes, yes. - Where does AOC fit into that? - That's a good question. - What do you think\nabout AOC as a candidate? Do you think she eventually runs? - I think that if she doesn't\nrun into some kind of scandal, and I don't mean scandal in the sense of some personal\nimpropriety, that you know, but I mean some kind of\nmajor political problem. It seems that she has the staying power to be in American elected\npolitics for a long time. Whether she would even\nwant to be President, versus maybe going to the\nSenate, or being Governor, or whatever the case may be, I have no idea what her\nambitions are in that sense. But certainly like policy aside, she has this combination of\ncharisma, likability to some, but also something about her personality that angers the people who don't like her in a way that only fuels\nher sort of presence. Which I think applies to Trump as well, that I do think that she\nhas the potential to be, to have significant staying\npower in American politics. President, I don't know. - Do you think that's the\nfuture of political elections and politics in general, is people who are able to skillfully piss off the other side,\nlike AOC and Trump did? - I think it's an aspect of it. I think it's also understanding how to communicate policy ideas. Trump, you know, I have things I can praise Trump about if we wanna get to that\nsegment at some point. You let me know when that is, but I do think that there are some things Trump is very good at. And this is why it's very\nhard for me to believe that Ron DeSantis has what it takes to actually fight Trump\nin a national primary. And one of those things is Trump has a, even though he often\nsays very strange things, that if you transcribe them, you go, what language is that? That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. In the moment, the way he relates to\nadversaries on stage, et cetera, is very good in that he is very much aware of how it is going to\nbe seen by the audience. And so that's why a lot of times, it's more about doesn't matter that a word salad came out of his mouth, how he immediately responded\nand related to the person, very good. So I think that knowing how to be good when clips are shared all the time, often out of context is\nextraordinarily important. Knowing how to use social media, which every election cycle,\nthat means something different. But understanding how to use\nsocial media, very important. Those things are absolutely so important. And whether you're able to do\na deep dive on the deficit, it's certainly useful. But I would say it's a bad thing. It's becoming less important\nin terms of figuring out who we want to represent us. - So just lingering on the AOC, and then maybe let's throw\nin Bernie Sanders on that. So where do you place yourself and how do you do the layout of the land of Bernie Sanders, AOC, Joe\nBiden, and David Pakman? - My instinct is, and\nI'm going to answer it, the thing that makes this\ntough is Bernie says, he's a Democratic socialist. He ran as a social Democrat. He didn't run on anything\nthat was really socialism. So I'm going by their\npublic facing platforms. - I've been listening to\nhim for many, many years, and all the way back to\nthe Thom Hartman Show. And I think using the terms\nas you've been using them, he has, I don't think ever\nbeen a Democratic socialist. I haven't heard him speak about socialism. I think, I've heard him\nspeak about social programs and the value of social programs throughout the history\nof the United States and how they've been beneficial. - My understanding is\nvery similar to yours. Although there may be stuff from the '70s where he really was talking about-- - [Lex] We've all been\nassociated in the '70s. - Yeah, yeah. You and I even who weren't around, we were doing stuff in the '70s. - [Lex] I feel like we did, yeah. - My sense would be, you know,\nBiden is like center left, and then I'm to the left of that. But maybe just inside of\nwhere AOC and Bernie are, or very, very similar to Bernie. I mean I identify with\na lot of Bernie's ideas. Maybe their implementation,\nI'm more flexible on. I'll give you one example, Medicare for all. One way of trying to get\nhealthcare to everybody, which Bernie's very big on, is you take the current Medicare program, you just eliminate the age limit, make it available to everybody,\npay for it through taxation. Interesting. However, I'm open to other models if they get everybody healthcare, that is good quality and affordable. Singapore has an interesting model, Germany has an interesting model. I am more agnostic about how\nwe do it than just saying, let's expand Medicare. Whether that puts me to the\nright of Bernie, I don't know, but I'm not like exactly right there on it has to be Medicare for all. - Yeah, that's more just\nflexibility versus dogmatism. So I don't know if that\nputs you to the left or to the right. - I don't either. - What do you think about the, we could term manipulation\nor the corruption in the DNC that perhaps tipped the\nskills against Bernie in the election? Do you think there was such a-- - In 2016 or 2020? (Lex laughing) - Both, I would say, in different, the dynamics there were\ndifferent with Hillary Clinton and the pressure from Hillary\nClinton as a candidate and so on. I mean, was there, why didn't Bernie win, I guess is one way to ask? - Okay, I think there's\na couple things here. First, the DNC, I'm not a Democrat. Just your audience may not\nknow, I'm just a independent. I mostly vote for candidates\nthat end up being Democrats. In local elections, often\nthere's no party designation. So okay, I'm obviously on the\nleft, I'm not denying that. But the Democratic Party as an institution has never really been interesting to me. - You're still a rebel that resists belonging to any institution. - Exactly right, exactly right. And whether it matters, I don't know. The DNC and the RNC\nreally are organizations that to some degree exist to\njustify their own existence because if they were no longer necessary, they would go away. And so they have to assert their\nvalue and their importance. They do this in a number\nof different ways. Organizing the way that\nthe nominee is chosen, the convention, working\nwith states on everything from redistricting to\nwhatever else the case may be. Setting the order of primaries and having some involvement in how that's all going to happen. And also coordinating behind the scenes, I guess they would describe it\nas making sure our candidates don't get in each other's ways. We might see it and say,\nthey're picking the winner. There's nothing illegal\nabout them being involved in picking the winner, but we might say it's not\nin people's interests. I think the 2020 primary\nwas really interesting. Bernie supporter myself, I started telling my audience\nafter a couple primaries and even before, based on\npolling and different things, I see a real uphill\nbattle here for Bernie. And it's really important, people in my audience are not the average, you know, union worker in Michigan who is mostly working\nand raising a family, and then goes to vote on primary day and goes to vote on election day. If you spend a lot of time\non Reddit and Twitter, you're going to have an inflated sense of Bernie's popularity\nwithin the Democratic Party. That was my sense. And to some degree we saw\nthat in certain states. I don't have the exact\nprimary order in results in front of me or or in my head. But the big turning\npoint was South Carolina. South Carolina was when Joe\nBiden won and won handily, understood to be because of the larger African American population\nin South Carolina. And right around that exact same time, I actually don't remember now whether it was the day\nafter or the day before, some of the smaller Democratic candidates, smaller in terms of support, got out and said, I'm endorsing Joe Biden. And to some degree, of course, it was all organized and timed to help Joe Biden. There's no doubt about that. This is what the DNC does. It's hard for me to be mad at the DNC because this is sort of like, if we believe they were\nthere to be unbiased arbiters and to stay as much on\nthe side as possible, it would make sense to be furious that they've gone against their stated, you know, kind of mandate. But we know that the DNC negotiates and is working behind the\nscenes, and has a favorite, that favorite was Hillary in 2016, 2020. So I share the frustration about\nthe power that the DNC has, but for people who were saying\nthey did something illegal or whatever else the case may be, that doesn't seem to be the case. But this is part of why, I mean, I would love there not to be this duopoly of Republicans and Democrats. And there's probably four major\nchanges that have to happen in order to make that a reality. But I share the frustration\nof folks while recognizing that Reddit was not\naccurately representing Bernie's level of popularity. - Still I wish that the\nbias wasn't towards the, what could be negatively\ntermed the deep state, towards the bureaucracy, towards\nthe momentum of the past, which I think Joe Biden kind\nof represents versus new ideas. Which is funny to say that Bernie Sanders somehow represents new ideas, 'cause he is also an older gentleman. - Well it's a lot of framing. And the other aspect to that is, on paper, Joe Biden's platform was arguably the most progressive of\nany Democratic candidate who won the nomination. Now of course there were\npeople who challenged the nominations who were\nto Joe Biden's left. A lot of this is perspective,\nand it, you know, that's how you end up saying, the guy who's a couple\nyears older than Biden is actually the guy with\nthe fresh perspective. Which is interesting because\nI don't disagree with you. - Yeah, and you also have to say, the perspective doesn't always\nalign with the policies. You're right on, you know, the actual policies of\nJoe Biden are different than maybe the perception of Joe Biden. - Or what he ran on. I mean, just two examples\nI would give are, during his campaign, he\nplayed up a little bit, his interest in doing\nstudent loan forgiveness and something on cannabis. I never bought it. I told my audience, I think\nhe's saying this stuff because this is the way\nthe tide is kind of, the wind is blowing and he's being advised to say this stuff. I don't think he's gonna do very much on either of these things. He did actually do some\nstudent loan stuff. But that would be two examples I think. - Okay, let's go to the,\nsomething you alluded to, which is the pros and cons\nof a particular candidate. Well, what to you, as a critic of Trump, what to you are the pros, the\nstrengths of Donald Trump, and what to you are\nhis biggest weaknesses? - The strengths of Trump. Let's see how I can frame them in a way that is both accurate and accurately assesses\nmy feeling about it. - And could be taken out\nof context most masterfully through the clipping process. - Yes. Trump's strengths are mostly superficial, and in terms of presentation. Trump was able to, I call it a grift. Some on the right say he's just so good at relating to different types of people. Trump as a rich guy from New York City, was able to convince people\nthat he spent most of his life trying to be kept isolated from, that he had their best interests in mind, that he knew why they weren't doing well in the 2016 economy, and that he had solutions that he was going to bring forward. The truth is, he never\nreally liked those people. And as soon as they weren't useful to him for a brief period of time, he, you know, that love affair\nwith his followers stopped, and then now it's back\nthat he needs them again. He didn't really understand\nthe causes of the problems that those folks were experiencing. And his solutions were laughable, right? Like Jared was going to solve the Israeli Palestinian\nconflict in year one. He was gonna replace Obamacare in 2017. Things that were never\ngoing anywhere, anywhere. But what he did really well was he put up a united front of,\nI know what is ailing you, I know how to fix it, and I know how to fix it, I guess, because he's a businessman and he's been above the fray\nof politics for so long, knowing how to use political\ndonations to his advantage. He called that smart, et cetera. I think that's his greatest strength. - Why do you say that the Jared plan for Israel and Palestine and the plan for healthcare\nto improve Obamacare, why do you say that's laughable? - Well, only someone, I would include the\nNorth Korea plan as well, which I'm glad to talk about. Only someone who doesn't know anything about the size and scope of these issues could so arrogantly say\nthat they could solve them in that way and on that timeframe. I'm all for optimism and\nbringing a new face to things, absolutely, without a doubt. But, you know, a wall with\nMexico that Mexico will pay for at the end of my first term. I know there are people who believed it because they would call\ninto my show and say, I'm voting for Trump because of it. But it's hard to believe\nthat anybody serious would fall for that, unless you were deliberately wanting to just believe whatever\nwas being fed to you, or you just hadn't ever thought\nabout these issues before. The healthcare plan, you know, in 2017 they proposed one would've led to 24 million or so people ending up without healthcare. Didn't go anywhere 'cause\nit was so terrible. And then in August of 2020, Trump said, in two weeks I'm gonna finally\nhave my healthcare proposal. It's 2023, we still never got it. You know, with all of these things when you think them through,\nit was just sort of arrogance. And I get the perspective of, I want optimism and I liked that optimism. It worked. I mean fair. A lot of people saw it and liked it. As someone who followed a\nlot of those issues closely, they seemed of course\nlike impossible promises. - Well it's a double-edged sword. So to push back a little bit, if you look at the things I have a little bit more knowledge about, which is the space of\nartificial intelligence, there's a company called DeepMind, and there's a company called OpenAI that we're laughed at for a long time when they were talking about that they're going to solve intelligence. And now they've made, especially DeepMind, and now most recently OpenAI with GPT, they've made progress that\nmost of the AI community would not have imagined\nthey'd be able to make. Everything from AlphaGo\nbeating the world Go champion. Just all the different steps and progress that I can get into,\nwere surprised everybody. And they are legitimately fearlessly pursuing the task of solving intelligence. The other aspect, he gets\na lot of criticism now, but another example is Elon Musk. I can say a lot of things, like SpaceX, so commercial space flight. He was laughed at for a long\ntime that that's possible. Same thing with autopilot in\nTesla, autonomous vehicles. His approach was harshly\ncriticized by all the experts, and still criticized, to\nthis day, deeply criticized. And as a person that I believe objectively can look at the progress of autopilot as a semi-autonomous vehicle system has been incredibly surprising. So the reason I mentioned\nthat is sometimes it feels like you need the guy or the gal who makes those preposterous,\nambitious statements, like we're going to solve\nhealthcare this year. Like, and then there's\nexperts like yourself that are looking, thinking, have you read anything about the history of Israel Palestine, is a good example of that. Do you know there's a history there? Do you realize how complicated,\nhow many people have tried, how many people have failed? How many millions of\npeople hate each other in this little place,\nin this land, that like, sometimes the expertise\ncan really weigh you down. So sort of to push back, sometimes you have to have\nthe almost be naive and stupid and just rush in with an optimism in order to actually make some progress. - I agree with you 100%. I think it's interesting that\nall of the examples you gave of successes are from\nthe technology space. - Not politics, yes. - Not from politics, which I mean, listen, I would love to be able to make headway on some of these issues more\nquickly without a doubt. I do think at some point though, when it comes down to voting and saying, one of these people is going\nto be ostensibly in charge for four years through\nall of the departments, and secretaries and\nchoices that they make, we do wanna apply some level of realism with the understanding that your examples are from the tech space. And they're good examples. There's no question about it. One thing I'll add to this, I recently read Bradley Hope's\nnew book about North Korea, and it's really about an activist who doesn't even really matter, but in the background of the book, it's written, much of\nwhat is written about happens during the Trump era. And when Trump did the\nfirst and then the second, I guess you'd call them\nsummits with Kim Jong Un. And it actually did seem\nlike to some degree, Trump's were gonna handle this like I do a business deal\napproach to Kim Jong Un. In some sense it actually was logical because of Kim Jong Un and the way that it was so ego-driven, and they both as sort of\nauthoritarian strong men types to different degrees wanted that. There was actually a colonel where I actually thought as I read it, Trump's initial idea wasn't crazy. The problem was he knew nothing about the backstory of the relationship. He fell for all sorts of\nlies from Kim Jong Un, and he made offers that\ndidn't make any sense to make. It fell apart, fine. But that's an example where\nI think Trump's personality was not actually at its base, the problem, when it came to North Korea. - Well there's other things of this nature that could go and, or some people argue goes\ninto the strengths and pros of Donald Trump for China, for\nexample, tariffs and China. Can you make the case that\nthere's some positive outcomes of the way Donald Trump acted with China? - It's really tough, and I'll\ngive you a couple reasons. - [Lex] Okay, then also cons. - Give you, it's tough to make. So the China thing is\nreally, so just very recently to when we're recording this, Trump was on Fox News interviewed\nby a guy named Mark Levin. And Trump proposed a new, I\ncall it a conspiracy theory, maybe it will strike you\nas something different about China, COVID, and tariffs. And Trump's suggestion was that the tariffs cost China so much money, China sent the US so much money in tariffs that they released COVID as punishment. Now there's a couple problems with that. One, American companies pay the tariffs. Trump still doesn't seem to know this. Trump seems to believe\nthat when he puts a tariff on Chinese imports, someone in China is cutting\na check to the United States. American companies buy\nthe stuff from China, and then American companies cut\na check to the United States for the tariff. Trump doesn't seem to get that. - But it still has a sting\nto the Chinese economy. - You can make the argument that if there is a suitable\nalternative domestically or from a different country, that it will reduce imports,\nbut it didn't happen. And we actually have reports\nnow that the tariffs on China cost about a quarter\nmillion American jobs. The other problem with that idea is China created and released\na virus in order to hurt you. But as of today, 5.7 of the 6.8 million deaths\nwere in other countries. It's a very indirect way. You're mostly killing\npeople in other countries to hurt Trump. Maybe there was a, this\nis the sort of thing where when I think about\nhow Trump dealt with China, it's very scary. Because given another four years, who knows what he might do if\nhe still doesn't understand how tariffs work. - So geopolitics operates\nin complicated ways with carrots and sticks, and Henry Kissinger has\nwritten quite a lot about this. And in some sense the positive aspect here that Donald Trump is\nwilling to take big risks in the game of geopolitics\nwith this giant superpower that is China. And a lot of others are too afraid, too afraid to call them out, to come to the table and criticize. - I certainly think that's\nan argument that can be made. My question would be, what tangible positive\noutcomes did it lead to? And it's tough to identify any. But I think it's a great thing. I mean, listen, one of the\nthings you're kind of getting at maybe indirectly is that there's been\nthis sense that politics has been done very\nsimilarly for a long time. And even between Democrats\nand Republicans still, even with some policy differences, there's still the kind of feeling that it's disconnected folks in DC, mostly dealing with issues\nthat don't directly affect. Look, I get that. I'm with you on that. I think the question as\nto whether Trump's bluster was positive rather than\nextraordinarily humiliating in many ways, I just come down on, it was an absolute and total humiliation. But I understand that you can recognize Trump doesn't know a lot of stuff, but his attitude was\nrefreshing in some way. That's a reasonable position\nfor someone to take. I disagree with it, but I understand it - Well, is trying and failing\nbetter than not trying? - This goes well beyond politics. You know, Wayne Gretzky\nhas weighed in about this. Michael Jordan has weighed\nin about, I mean this is, yeah, is it better to have\ntried and failed than never? Is it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved? I don't know. I mean, listen, we lived\nthrough four years of Trump. We know what that four year term was like, and it's very hard for me to\nsay that the things he tried were overwhelmingly reasonable. But I get the point you're trying to make, and I appreciate it. And it's, if we don't do any of it, then where do we end up, sure. We know where we ended up with with Trump and it was pretty embarrassing. - Okay, let's linger\non some more strengths. We didn't start any new wars. - [David] We didn't start-- - Is there something to that? - Yeah, that's, it's interesting. There's a few different\napproaches to dealing with that. First, it's really important to remember that the counterpoint to that from the folks who like to say that was that Hillary Clinton\nwas gonna start three wars. Sometimes they say four wars,\nsometimes they say five wars. Okay. The geopolitical situation\nduring the four years that Trump was in office, I don't know that they obviously\nlent themselves to wars that Trump just barely was\nable to keep us out of. I think the Russia thing is interesting, because now it's very\npopular to go back and say, you know, the reason Putin\ndidn't do the Ukraine thing when Trump, right, and to somehow give Trump credit for that. There's a counterpoint to it,\nwhich is Putin under Trump, particularly if Trump got four more years, would've been able to maybe\nconsolidate power in other ways because of his relationship with Trump. I'm not coming down on\none side or the other. It's not my area of expertise. But it's not the open shut slam dunk that, you know, Trump likes to say this. Putin didn't invade because\nhe knew I would crush 'em, and okay. So it's not obvious to me that\nthere were imminently wars that would've started during that time. That being said, you know, for all the criticism\nof Obama during Crimea, Trump seemed to just\nkind of forget about that after all the criticism and say, I'm not actually gonna\ndo anything about that. And so there are foreign policy criticisms that could be made. But it is true, no new wars\nwere started under Trump. And I like that. I don't like wars. - What do you think about\nhis handling of COVID? Can you say, what are the pros and cons\nof his handling of COVID? - The con for him is he'd\nbe President right now if he had handled it differently. I think it's abundantly clear. Early on, and there's now a\nlot of really good reporting about the conversations he was having with Jared Kushner and others. He became convinced, either because of things\nhe was being told, or because he decided this\nis the way it's going to be. This is gonna go away. Fine, it's in China. Okay, it's in China. In Italy, okay, we have 15\ncases, but it'll soon be zero. We'll be open by Easter of 2020. None of it happened. If he had handled it in the following way, and I've said this to Rogan, and I've said this to Patrick Bet-David, and they tend to all see my side of this. If Trump had said, listen, we don't know\nhow bad this is gonna be, but I care too much\nabout the American people to take a shot. So it's not gonna be two weeks,\nit's gonna be a little bit, but I need your help. We're gonna bring everybody together. I don't care if you're a\nDemocrat or a Republican, we're gonna have MAGA masks, and he could have kept\n50 cents on the dollar to pay off Stormy or whoever, right? But it would've been, I\nthink he wins reelection, because the perception was, and reality is a version of that. The perception was that he\nwas way too cavalier about it early on. People died who didn't need to die. And I think that it was\narguably the one area where he could have all but guaranteed that he was going to\nget himself reelected. - Well to push back on that,\nI mean, because you mentioned sort of masks and lockdowns\nkind of a solution to COVID. - I didn't mention lockdowns, but I'm glad to talk about policy. - Sure, quarantine, like there's several\nsolutions to a pandemic broadly speaking. And one of them is a vaccine. And so you didn't mention that. He fast tracked the development. He, his administration fast\ntracked the development of the vaccine, which surprising he didn't\nreally take much credit for. - I think he did, I think he tried. There's a couple, there's a lot there. - Well, to me, it seems\nlike you could make the case with the Trump hand gestures, that his decisions for fast tracking the development of the vaccine saved tens of millions of lives You could make, he could\nin the Trumpian way, make that case. - So, couple different things. I know you don't necessarily\nfollow Trump's rallies as closely as I do, and I'm\njealous of you for that. But he did tout the vaccine\nstuff hugely for a while, until his audience turned against him. And then he had to draw this\nline where he was going, I made the vaccines, which\nnone of you have to take, by the way, freedom. You don't have to take\nthem, but it's fantastic. And nobody else could have done it. But don't worry, nobody's gonna\nmake you take the vaccine. And he actually got booed at\na couple of his own rallies when talking about the vaccines. But let's back up a little bit. Fast tracking, my\nunderstanding of what he did is he did what any President\nin his situation would do, and what many world leaders\nelsewhere did as well, which is he agreed to\npre-purchase supply of vaccine, in order to provide money\nto pharmaceutical companies to scale up the manufacturing,\nwhich is absolutely fine. But he wants, one of the stories he tells is it usually takes 12\nyears to develop a vaccine. We did it in nine months thanks to me. Decades of mRNA technology\nbeing developed, created the platform in which you can make a particular\nvaccine in nine months. Didn't have anything to do with Trump. He did pre-fund and say,\nwe will buy huge supply. And that provided liquidity to\nthe pharmaceutical companies. - But he also delegated control to people, to experts that enabled that kind of fast tracking\nof vaccines, right? - He was very eager for\nthe FDA to approve it, because he saw that there\nwould be a political benefit. - [Lex] And he didn't get in\nthe way, I guess is what-- - He didn't get in the way, fair. I think now we're on the same page. He did not get in the way\nof vaccines being developed, which is good. - Presidents and bureaucracies have a way of getting in the way. - And I don't disagree with that. I'm not aware of really any\ngovernments that got in the way. I mean, it seemed, given\nthe global situation, everybody, European countries\nwere pre-purchasing vaccine. African countries were, who were going to be\nlater to receive vaccines, were partnering with\nthe European countries that had pre-purchased. But the most interesting\nthing about all of this is Trump did play up the\nvaccines for a long time until his crowd didn't\nwanna hear about it anymore, which was crazy. It was sort of like he became a victim of the monster he created to some degree. - One of the effects of all\nthis that makes me truly sad is this division over the vaccines has created distrust in science. - Yeah. - And also what makes me sad\nis the scientific leaders, Anthony Fauci being one\nof the representatives of that community, I would say\ncompletely dropped the ball. - Hmm, in what way? - They spoke with arrogance. They spoke down to people, they spoke in a way that a\ngreat scientist does not speak, which is they spoke with\ncertainty, without humility. Like they have all the wisdom, and all of us are too\ndumb to understand it, but they're going to be the parent that tells us exactly what to do, versus speaking to the\nimmensity of the problem, the deep core of the problem\nbeing the uncertainty. We don't know what to do. The terrifying thing about the pandemic, we don't know anything\nabout it as it's happening. And so you have to make decisions, you have to take risks about, well maybe you have to overreact in order to protect the populace. But it's in the face of\nuncertainty, they have to do that, not powered, empowered by science somehow, and the deep expertise as\nsomebody like Anthony Fauci claims to have. So like the, I just,\nI'm really troubled by, yeah, the distrust and science\nthat resulted from that. And that you have to blame the leaders, I mean, to the degree,\nleaders take responsibility. And I think Anthony Fauci\nwas the scientific leader behind the American\nresponse to the pandemic. And I think he failed as a scientist, as a representative of science. - I'm less, I don't know if\ninterested is the right word, but the kind of the Fauci\nreview is less interesting to me in terms of what comes next than the first part you mentioned, which is the distrust in science. And sometimes I'll get\nvoicemails or emails from people in my audience who say, that I have had to\nbackpedal on certain things related to this. And one of the things I tried\nto do from the beginning was not speak in certain terms when we really didn't\nhave complete information. So there was this period\nwhere hydroxychloroquine was first sort of mentioned\nas a possible treatment, prophylactic, or you know,\nproactive treatment for COVID, or active treatment for COVID, along with a bunch of other stuff. There was ivermectin, there was Vitamin D, there were all sorts of different things. And I tried to be careful to say, right now we don't have rigorous science that tells us that some\nof these things work. It doesn't mean that\nwon't come in the future. At which point, if there was something as\ncheap as hydroxychloroquine that treated COVID effectively,\nunbelievable, fantastic. It's not, there's no way\nit ever will be determined. We don't have that information right now. So it's not super wise right now to go and start taking this stuff. We eventually learned,\nlike with Vitamin D, having an appropriate Vitamin\nD level does seem to be, based on what I've most recently read, generally protective, and a good thing when it comes to infections\nof different, great. Okay, so that one we figured out. One of the really difficult\nthings is that the quote, truth about the vaccines did change. And the original, again, this is all, I don't pretend to be an expert, but just someone who's\nsynthesizing the medical data and writing about it, originally, the first vaccine related to the wild type strain did\nseem to be very effective, not only at preventing\ndeath and serious illness, but also transmission. There were people then saying, it doesn't prevent transmission. Over time, as the variants came forward, the vaccine became less effective at that. At that point I started telling my audience something different, because as far as I was concerned, the reality on the ground had changed. In my mind, that's how science works. It's not backpedaling, it's\nwe're adjusting our beliefs to what is taking place in the real world. - Well, to be fair, the scientists, many of whom are my friends,\nviralogists and biologists, they have way more humility\nthan people like Anthony Fauci, who are speaking about\nthis, or the CEO of Pfizer who are speaking about this. This is the fundamental problem here. Is the way science work is, has, the way science works is there's\nusually a lot more humility and a lot more transparency about what we know and what we don't know. And people like Anthony Fauci thought it would be beneficial for the world if he speaks with more certainty. But because of the political division that formed around that, that certainty resulted in, became completely counterproductive, that people didn't trust\nanything about the vaccine, didn't trust any institutions. There were, that contained the experts that actually knew what they were doing, and basically didn't trust anything that was coming out of\nthe mouths of scientists, some large percent of the population. So that made you\ncompletely ineffective in, at scale, as a society trying to respond to a terrible pandemic. And that's where I put a\nlot of blame on leaders. So political leaders\nand scientific leaders are the ones that should inspire us to all get together and respond, and that should be the\ncase for the pandemic, that should be the case\nin the time of war, all this kind of stuff. - I generally agree with you, and for me it's really about shared blame. And there were a lot of different reasons why that the early\ncommunication wasn't good. Part of it was, I mean, for me, I prefer accuracy\nrather than overconfidence. I would prefer, listen, we\ndon't really know right now whether masks do X or Y. What we do know is the\nsupply is really limited of this type of mask. We're gonna try to keep 'em\nfor the frontline workers. I love that. That's the way I want\nto be communicated to. A call was made to do it differently, which was to say the\nmasks don't actually help, but the real reason is\nthey want to keep them for healthcare workers. And then later the masks\nare what's going to solve. I'm with you 100%. I think the other layer to it, is you can't ignore the\npolitical situation at the time. If Trump had won reelection, and the vaccine\ndistribution had taken place while Trump was President\nrather than Biden, my belief is that the\nsame number of Democrats would've gotten vaccinated, but way more Republicans would've as well, because they were following not science, but political leaders. And when it was Biden\nin DC instead of Trump, a lot of those people said,\nI don't trust the vaccine. But wait, it's Trump's vaccine, I thought. Yeah, but something about the\nway Biden's distributing it. So I do think you can't\nignore that political layer. I agree with you, the\ncommunication was a disaster. - Let me ask you about Joe Biden. What are the strengths and\nweaknesses of Joe Biden? - Weaknesses, I think\nare some of the things you've identified. He is not seen as high energy. He is not the same Joe Biden\nthat debated Paul Ryan in 2012 and ran circles around him, in just an incredible debate performance. He is not inspiring in the way that someone like a Barack\nObama was to people coming up and starting to get\ninterested in politics. I think a lot of those\nare fair criticisms. I think on policy, he's not interested in a lot of the things that younger voters are interested in. I mentioned cannabis reform,\nI mentioned student loans. So I think that that's\na deficit for Biden. I think the upside to Biden, is when it comes to\nforeign policy, diplomacy, high level negotiations, knowing how to engage with\nallies in a productive way, it's tough to find someone with\nmore experience than Biden. I know that there are\ncounterpoints to what I'm saying, and those include that was the old Biden, the new Biden doesn't have it. That includes, that's just a sign of rot because he's been around for so long. Nobody should be around\nthat long in politics. Perfectly reasonable\ncriticisms to talk about. But I do see that as one of his strengths. And he also is good at knowing when he can work with\nRepublicans, and when he can't, and not wasting more time\nthan is sort of expected for posturing reasons. And I think that that's a good thing. - Do you think he's actually there, so in day-to-day operation of government, given his cognitive capabilities, do you think he is an active\nand practicing executive? - I don't know that I can say that it's because of what\nmay be going on cognitively, but my sense from the people I talk to, is that he's very much involved in the highest level geopolitical, and big domestic economic stuff. But that a lot of the smaller issues that presidents might or might not be in sort of plugged into, that he's not plugged into the details of a lot of the lower level stuff. - Yeah, you could probably\napply the same exact criticism even more so towards the\nDonald Trump administration in terms of being a\npracticing active executive who's paying attention. Like for example, like Vladimir Putin is somebody who loves the\nrole of the executive, has a huge amount of meetings, is constantly tracking\ninformation about agriculture and all the different\nsubsystems of government. Stalin, funny enough, was\nalso extremely good at this. So certain people just love\nthe job of being an executive. And I'm not sure if Donald Trump did, and I'm not sure if Joe\nBiden in this current state has the cognitive capability to. - It's a good question, Kim Jong Un's another one by the way. You know, there's videos\nof him examining a pottery, you know, a factory\nwhere they make plates, and making very specific comments about how the plates should be made. I think that in that case, there's a lot of propaganda value to it. With Trump, I think you're probably right. You know, he did get involved\nin the minutiae of things. I mean once he pulled out a weather map, and with a sharpie, drew\na different hurricane path that was more politically\nconvenient to him. That's pretty micro, you know, saying the weather channel's wrong. - I see what you did there. - [David] This is, okay. - I see what you did there. - So that's a micro,\nhe went to Puerto Rico and he gave out paper\ntowels after a hurricane. Now he was shooting them like free throws, which didn't look very good. So he will get involved in the\nmicro when it's advantageous, you know what I mean? But I do agree with you that he wants to just kind of\nmake it, so build the wall. I don't know, just build it,\nfigure it out, get it done. - [Lex] Quick pause, bathroom break. - Sure. - Yeah, you're hilarious. And just for the sake of completeness, I should mention the\nsubreddit, what Biden has done. There's also what Trump has\ndone, but it's not as active. And it has like this master\nlist of all the accomplishments. It's, I recommend people\nlook at it 'cause there's, it's kind of rigorous and\ninteresting with links, a list of all the things he's done. Just to list some of them,\nrestored daily press briefings, canceled the Keystone Pipeline,\nreversed Trump's Muslim ban, required masks on federal property, rejoins the Paris Climate Agreement, extend student loan payment\nfreeze, extend eviction freeze, historic stimulus bill, as you mentioned, ends funding for border\nwall, and so on and so forth. DACA, border strengthening of DACA, rejoins the World Health Organization. And the timing of this\nof course is important. Yeah, several historic stimulus bills, which of course you could\ncriticize or support. Raise the minimum wage\nfor federal contractors and federal employees for $15. There's a lot, there's a lot. It makes you realize\nwith both Trump and Biden that there's a bunch of\nsmall details that matter. - [David] Yeah. - Like that matter on people's lives, like actual little policies. Trump did a lot of stuff as far\nas I heard for the military. Like not big stuff, but small stuff. - Yeah, I'd be curious\nwhat you're thinking of. I mean, I know one of the\nbig things under Trump was we're gonna get trans\npeople out of the military. - [Lex] That's not what\nI was referring to. - You weren't referring to that. He, Trump's hilarious with\nthese stories that he tells, and one of the story,\nand you get to know them, if you follow him at all. He tells the story, you know,\nwhen I came into office, the generals came to me and they said, \"Sir, the cupboards are bare. \"We have no bullets. \"And so I rebuilt the military, you know, \"the cupboards were\nbare when Obama left it, \"and it was just terrible. \"But I rebuilt it and the generals, \"I've got the best generals, they said, \"Sir, it's incredible\nwhat you were able to do.\" You look into it and it's like, yeah, that's not really true. Like it is true that there are armaments that just like on a\nschedule, do get replaced, and that's part of the\nmilitary industrial complex. But there's nothing like\nspecial Trump really did. But these stories become, they take on like a life of their own. And it's interesting to sometimes try to dig down and figure out like, was there any policy connected to that or is that just a story? - Do you think it's possible to have a good conversation\nwith each of them, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, in a podcast context\nor in a debate context? - Absolutely. Yeah, you're saying like,\ncould I with of either them? - [Lex] Yes. - Oh, 100%, yeah. - [Lex] Joe Biden too? - Sure, yeah. - But can you dig into that a little more? - Well, I mean, I don't know what, I think there's maybe something implicit in your question, but-- - That's deeper about\nthe nature of politics and politicians, yes. - I think with either of them, I mean the political differences\nwouldn't be an impediment to having a good conversation\nwith either of them. I think one of the things\nthat's really tough in my experience when\ntalking to elected officials, is they could be super interesting about 100 different topics, but handlers decide or try\nto get you to talk about something you don't really care about and something really narrow, which doesn't bring out\nyour best nor their best. And that's a frustration. But I think that given an unstructured three hour conversation, I think it would be\ninteresting to talk to both. I mean, listen with Biden, aside from his view on\ncannabis or whatever, his background and the incredible unimaginable family tragedy\nthat he had in his first wife, and you know, multiple kids dying. And I mean it's just incredible, you know? And with Trump, I think also you could have\nan interesting conversation. - Yeah, the human beings\nwere the life story. - [David] Yes. And they're some of the\nmost successful humans who have ever lived to have rose to this highest office in\ninteresting complex ways. - [David] Yes. - I mean one of the\nthings I'm troubled by, maybe you can speak to,\nis why we're so negative towards presidential\ncandidates and presidents. Why, it's just they go\nthrough this shit storm no matter who they are. They're like hated. Like all the conspiracy theories, and just the dynamics of how\nwe talk about them is vicious. If you just look at replies to\neven Barack Obama on Twitter, it's like, what is going on here? Why, because we look at other\nleaders in other spaces, and we're generally positive about it. - Yeah, there's a couple different things. There's this dynamic which\nis really unfortunate, which is, you ask people, do you approve of the job a\nparticular president is doing? And very often if at any point\nwhile they were in office they did something you don't like, people will say, I don't approve. And so by its nature what that means is just like the longer you're in office, the lower your approval\nrating's going to be. And very often that's the way it works. I mean there's major events like 9/11 spiked George W. Bush's\napproval to a incredible level. Then it came back down with the Iraq war. But there's this unfortunate thing that when people are just asked, you think Biden's doing a good job? If four months ago Biden\ndid something on healthcare that somebody didn't like,\neven if you like most of it, a lot of people from that\npoint forward will say, I don't approve. They might still vote for 'em, because they like him better than the alternative or whatever. It's just the dynamic of politics. And I agree it's very- - Does it have to be that way, you think? - I don't think it has to be\nthat way, but to unwind it, so many things would have to change. I think our election system\nis part of why politics is the way it is, where you have two choices and\nit's first passed the post, and we have this electoral college so that depending on\nwhich state you vote in, the kind of meaning and\nsignificance of your vote is different. If you vote in Montana, it's the Republican\ncandidate's going to win, and that changes the dynamics. I think that's part of it. I think that at a personal level, I've experienced this in my life a lot. We've become, and by we, I mean\npeople in the United States to some degree who talk about this stuff, we've become uncomfortable\nwhen there is disagreement, and it bleeds over into now we can't have a normal interpersonal\nrelationship anymore. I'm from Argentina, and in\nArgentina it's really common, even in my family, there are incredibly\nheated political debates, at the start, the middle, the\nend of some kind of gathering. But then everybody just goes back to like, okay, we disagree on some\nthings, but that's okay. And we can now go, and you know, finish cooking the beef, or\nwhatever it is that we're doing. And I experienced the civic, even with people who come\nup to me on the street, and they go, just earlier today, a guy came up to me and he said, \"RFK all the way baby\",\ntalking about Bobby Kennedy Jr. And I just kind, you know, I said, \"Oh, all right, you know,\nlet's see what happens.\" And then there was another moment where the guy ended up standing next to me for maybe longer than he thought. And I could tell this\nguy's getting so awkward, because it was an utterance he thought that would just be\non the fly and he'd be gone. But now we're standing next to each other waiting for our sandwiches. It's like no big deal. You know, it's just, oh okay,\nyou like Bobby Kennedy Jr. I don't plan to vote\nfor, it's fine, you know? And that's like a sociocultural thing. I think there's lots of other countries. I've spent time in Italy, I have relatives in Israel where\nlike shouting at each other is sort of like normal. And then you just go back and finish the, it sounds like shouting,\nI'm sort of exaggerating, but very animated, what\nseemed like big disagreements. And then everybody's cool. I wish it were more normal. - So maybe the mechanism of going from shouting to being\ncool again needs to improve, because maybe we can't solve\nthe shouting at each other. - [David] Maybe not. - So maybe we need to somehow\nfigure out the deescalation, like making up, I've had a few recent fights\nwith friends like that. - Really? - Yeah.\n- For politics? - No.\n- Oh. - No, but political style,\nemotionally drenched stuff. And it was interesting to\ngo through that full process and then make up at the end. But it was a process, and it was a process that\nrequired being in person, and talking through it. And it was stressful, the whole thing. And then maybe because most of\nour interactions are online, we don't get a chance to do\nthat in person, making up again. I don't know, but do you think it's a\nfeature or a bug of the system that we're so, we just hate the powerful. - You mentioned the online part. I think it's a, you mentioned\nit earlier perfectly, which is you take\ncontentious political issues, you create a platform that rewards controversy and disagreement, and limits the number of\ncharacters you can use to express yourself. You kind of throw it into a\nbaking dish, and you know, mix the entire thing up. It's complete and total chaos. And one of the things that, you know, I've talked before about all\nthe angry emails and threats and stuff that I get. I'm acutely aware that if I\nhad in-person conversations with most of these people, the conversations would basically be like, oh, we have different views about how to solve some of\nthe problems we're facing. We probably agree about\nwhat the problem is, and we probably share many values. But on these particular four issues, we may have very different\nviews, but that's okay. Online, that's not the case. And it leads to, you know, the mess that we get ourselves in. But I think that it's a\nfeature of a lot of the systems that are being used to\ndisseminate information. - Again, let me linger on that. Do you regret some of the mockery and the snarky use on\nTwitter, and even in your show that kind of feeds that division? - I don't regret it in the sense that it's a calculated\npart or tool that I use in addition to figuring out how to simplify complicated concepts, and choosing stories that I\nthink are underrepresented, and you know, it's all part of like the\npackage of what I'm doing. I recognize that my show is\nnot the audio visual version of a peer reviewed, you know,\nrandomized controlled trial about views on abortion\nor whatever the case. Like I'm very much aware of that. But I don't regret including it as a tool that I've used to build the community in sum total that I've built over the last more than 10 years. - I guess I could ask about\nthe different trajectories you think your show might take. So, you know, the dynamic\nyou had with Donald Trump Jr. and maybe Candace Owens is the\nmore appropriate comparison. Are you okay having that\ndance for the next few years between you and Candace Owens, and just kinda the mockery, the derision that's a part of that process and taking part in that, you know? - I'm fine with it in the sense of, personally I tolerate it well, until it crosses the line, and people pull my family in and- So that's the part that-- - If we set the family stuff aside-- - [David] If I set that aside-- - So just in the digital space-- - I'm glad to mix it up. Now the truth is, Candace Owens\nhas had me blocked for years up until this incident. I don't lie. - [Lex] Did she unblock you? - She unblocked me just to tweet\nabout what I tweeted about. I don't know the backstory\nof that, genuinely, I have no idea. So I don't have a sense\nthat she's super interested in engaging with me on that. But all of these people, I mean Candace Owens is\nwelcome on my show anytime, Don Jr.'s welcome on my show anytime. It's been a decade since\nI had Ben Shapiro on. He's welcome at any time. I'm glad to have these conversations, and I think it's an important thing. And also I wish that everybody was willing to have the\nconversations in good faith, rather than as performance. It's not even really performance, or rather than being simply\nperformative for an audience that you have. - In terms of your\nmotivations, do you see, do you worry about the effects\nof something we spoke of, spoke about offline with\nlike the YouTube algorithm? Are you driven by the number\nof views your videos get, or are you driven by something else? - So in my world, I guess I would say, the number of views that\nany platform generates is a metric that I can\nchoose how to interpret. I can choose to interpret it as, I've created content that's\ninteresting to people, or I've created content\nthat's really angering people, and that's why they're showing up, they don't actually like it, it's because they're angry or\nwhatever else the case may be. But it is true that there\nare algorithmic changes that can take place. Something happened in early January that affected us on YouTube, or there are periods on\nTikTok where you can tell, we're doing all the same things. Something has happened and then you never usually\nfigure out what it is. So for me it's sort of\njust like a general tool to see what is the level of\ninterest in what I'm doing, and are the numbers so out of whack, with what I would expect, that I should look into\nwhether something deeper is happening. Has there been some change to an algorithm or whatever the case may be. I had a debate once with\nsomeone who accused me of using clickbait to generate views, and we had a really interesting\nconversation where I said, tell me really what you mean by that. Is your argument that I'm using titles that don't actually represent\nwhat's in the video? No, what's in the title is in the video. I go, okay, so it's not\nthat the title is dishonest, are you saying I'm\ndeliberately picking titles that will garner a larger audience? And they said, yeah,\nthat's kind of what I mean. And I said, isn't that kind\nof what we're all doing? The alternative would be choosing titles to generate a smaller audience, which seems like a real\nkind of waste of time. So I'm trying to navigate\nand play the game in a way that's comfortable, but use the metrics more as a tool than as something to obsess over. - Nevertheless, the\nmetrics are what they are in that they're able\nto affect your psyche. It's very difficult, which is why I have a Chrome extension that hides all the views and\nall that on YouTube for me. Is difficult not to let it\naffect how you think about ideas. So maybe your extensive exploration of a particular topic like healthcare, generated very few views, is it difficult for you to\nstill care about healthcare? There's some aspect of the human mind that starts being affected by those views. And I think that's a\nreally dangerous thing. Mostly it's probably beneficial, because it probably makes\nyou a better presenter, if you do care about a topic a lot, you become more charismatic, more, you learn sort of\nin Jimmy Mr. Beast way how to present the ideas better. But it also can affect which\ntopics you choose to cover, what you choose to think\nabout those topics, the audience capture of those topics. And that's a really scary effect. I'm really worried about\nmy own mind in that, so I run from that aggressively. - One of the things that I\ninclude in my overall approaches, I don't think about any one clip, I think about an entire\nshow, or a week of shows, or a month of shows. And so it's less about\ndoes one clip do well. My view going in is, I'm going to do stuff\nthat won't do that well, but I think it's really important to do, and I want to make it part of my show. And so when I did a clip with 10 ideas for reducing gun violence, I know that that's not gonna\nget 500,000 or a million views. I know it's just not going to. And the first day it'll\nget 12,000 and I'll go, I don't care, that's fine. There's a group of people in my audience that values this stuff, and I\nwanna keep doing this stuff. I'll end up surprised sometime. And two weeks later, it has 150,000 views because it started being shared, great. But I don't go into it thinking, these all need to be\nhome runs by that metric. I always go in saying, I want to put out a diversity of content, including stuff that is less\ntitillating and salacious, but is important to do, it's\nmore researched, et cetera. And so that's the way I try to resist exactly what you're talking about. - And I think you have to\nprobably know yourself. Like for me, metrics, I\njust like numbers too much. And for me, metrics do affect me. This is why I don't pay attention at all. Like I can't, I would\nlove to hire somebody on the team who cares, 'cause we currently have folks who just, all of us just don't care. 'Cause it probably is good to care enough to kind of just do good\nthumbnails and this kind of stuff to pay attention. But to me personally, I just\nfind inner peace and focus if I don't think about the numbers at all. 'Cause I find myself, I just remember a long time\nago when I started a podcast, I would think that I failed\nif it didn't do well. Like if I didn't celebrate\nthe person well enough, I didn't do a good job\nenough of a conversation, when that's not necessarily\nat all what that means. And it's hard not to like-- - This is tough stuff. I mean yeah, I know\nexactly what you're saying. And part of it is, I mean it starts in my, you have a little bit of a\ndifferent situation than me, because you're doing long form\nconversations with people, and the prep is a little bit different. One of the things in my space, because I'm reacting mostly\nto what's going on in the news and then also picking\ntopics to dive into it a little bit more deeply, is I have very little\ncontrol over the news cycle, and there is a meta\nmetric or a macro metric that affects me, that will quadruple my audience, and then take 75% of it away, which is the seasonality\nof election cycles. And the first few election\ncycles, it's very tough, because I go, it's October, I'm like, at this rate we're gonna\nhave 20 million subscribers by the next, these\nnumbers are unbelievable. And then it's January 30th,\nthe inauguration's over, the debate is about the debt ceiling, and nothing's going on, and I go, nobody's watching my content. I must have forgotten to upload a, like something must be wrong. It's completely beyond my control. So I just, and I think part\nof what you're saying is, I try to focus on the\nthings I can control, and understand those that I really have no\ncontrol over whatsoever, and try not to worry about them. - And try to do the\nthings that make you happy at the end of the day. You mentioned RFK, the guy you met. What do you think about\nsome of the other candidates outside of Joe Biden in\nthe Democratic Party? RFK Jr, what do you think\nof him as a candidate? - I've met him, we once had dinner, and we have a number of friends in common, which is what makes this\na little more awkward. But I think his campaign is basically sort of like a chaos\ncandidacy to raise awareness, and maybe raise money either for his book, or his anti-vaccine organization, Children's Defense Fund,\nI believe it's called. I think there's some reporting that Steve Bannon really liked the idea of him running as a Democrat, again, to just generate chaos. I don't find it super interesting. I don't find it worthy\nof that much discussion. Smart guy, nice guy, has\nbeen doing anti-vaccine work that I don't find particularly inspiring. - So it's not just anti-COVID vaccine, it's more broader than that? - He's been in that space long\nbefore the COVID vaccines. Yeah, I don't find it super interesting. - Well, he also wrote the\nbook, The Real Anthony Fauci, is that the name of the book? - Did he write that? That's, I don't know. I'm not sure about that. I'm aware of that book, I\ndidn't know he wrote it. - I think I need, but it's\nbeen on my reading list to get, I've been trying to get a\ngood balanced reading list about the COVID pandemic, to understand what the hell happened. And anytime I start to\ntry to go into that place, it's just, I'm exhausted by it. - Well, it's interesting to me\nthat you wouldn't wait longer before delving into those books, to have maybe a more clear hindsight. - But I think this is a pretty good time. You don't think so? Like this, it depends on your goals. If you're thinking of it\nas a historical event, yes, you should probably wait longer. But if you're thinking\nabout like understanding what is broken about our system, that we responded so poorly, that there was so much division? What is broken about our political system that it didn't unite us, it divided us? Who's to blame? There's probably a lot\nof different narratives, but I feel like the more\nyou learn about this, the better you can understand. I've read on just Vladimir Putin, I read like five biographies\nalready, maybe more. Just it helps to really\nunderstand, the people involved, the organizations evolved. I don't know, everything\nfrom the scientists to the political leaders. It felt like the blog posts and the tweets didn't quite capture. - They didn't quite get. No, one of the things I read a ton, I don't read any like\nmodern political books. So I don't read the memoirs\nof elected officials. I don't read any, I just feel like I get\nenough of it in my job. So my reading list is just other things. It's history, it's narrative non-fiction, economics, et cetera. And that's my bias\nbecause I'm so overloaded with a lot of the stuff\nyou're talking about. I haven't read any of Obama's books. I didn't read John\nBolton's book, or you know, I don't read any of that stuff. Although I'm sure there is\nvalue to be gleaned from it. - What about the other candidate that, according to the subreddit, and as you mentioned, you've\ncriticized a little bit, Marianne Williamson. Do you think, what are the pros and cons\nof her as a candidate? - This is another area\nwhere many in my audience really are angry with me. I don't find her candidacy\nsuper interesting. I'll tell you the pros and\nthe cons as I see them. I do think that we have\nelected officials in the US, particularly presidents, from a really narrow range of backgrounds. So it's lawyers and\nsometimes business people, very, very often lawyers. I think we would benefit from a much greater\ndiversity of backgrounds. And I once said, and that would include\npeople from education, people from the science world, people with backgrounds maybe\nrunning nonprofits, et cetera. Now Marianne Williamson\ndid, I guess at one point, run some kind of small nonprofit, and some in my audience\nthought that credential alone would make me fall head over heels in love with the idea\nof a Marianne candidacy. I've interviewed for her. It's just not for me is\nthe way I like to say it. It's the background of\nthe woo-woo type stuff is a bit off-putting to me. I understand that someone with literal Christian Bible\nbeliefs that also I don't like, maybe I'm more willing to accept as most of our presidents of\ncourse have had those views, because they're otherwise more qualified. But some of the things that she says, just strike me as, I just don't know. I'll give you an example. When she was on with Russell Brand, she said there's no such\nthing as clinical depression. It just means someone in a clinic told you you have depression. I don't believe that to be the case. I think we have an understanding, there's two types of depression. There's like a genetic\npredisposition depression, there's like a acute,\nsomething's happening in my life, temporary depression. You know, when she was asked\nabout it recently, she said, \"I didn't mean it, \"I was just trying to\nimpress Russell Brand.\" I don't know if I'm more bothered by the things she first said, or by the fact that she wanted\nto impress Russell Brand. But it's just like, it's\njust really not for me. And I agree with her on, we need to take the\nclimate more seriously, we need to expand access to health. I'm with all of that stuff. Now I wanna say one\nother thing about this. Anybody who wants to run should run. I am not suggesting there should be an uncontested\nprimary for Joe Biden. Absolutely. - So you think he should be contested? - Well what I mean by contested is, so there's two parts to\nwhat we mean by contested. Will the DNC organize debates? And we'll get to that in a second, but should anybody who's on\nthe left get out of the way because Joe Biden is President and he's running for reelection? Absolutely not. The question about\nshould there be debates, I would like there to be debates. The DNC pretty clearly isn't\ngoing to organize them. I think if you did them, you would have to say at what\npolling level do you qualify? And I don't know exactly\nwhere you put that number. But I think it would be a great thing to put Joe Biden on a stage with, if you can get, what, 6%, 8%, I'm not really sure what\nthe number would be. I'm totally all for that. - Why is this set of candidates, at least from my perspective, so weak? Do you have an understanding of this? - There's a lot of\ndifferent answers to this. One aspect to this, which I think is more of\na sociocultural thing, which I've recently read\nabout to some degree, is the job actually turns off the people who would be best at it, because of what you need\nto do to become President. And it includes all but\ncompletely abandoning your existing day-to-day life\njob, which you may depend on, and family to some degree. It's horribly negative, as\nwe already talked about. And at the end of all of that, you either lose and then have to rebuild, and maybe you're not in a\nposition to be able to do that, or you win and then now\nyou've got four years of being one of the most hated people, no matter how good a job you do. So I think by its nature it\nturns off a lot of people that would otherwise be good. I also think that there's\na lot of posturing from within the parties about, well, you might be good\nbut it's not your time yet, so you should wait. And then let's talk about maybe a Senate seat here and there. So it's like a company essentially, and they're figuring out\nwhere they wanna place people. I think all of these things make it so we end up with candidates most people aren't super thrilled with. - So it's difficult for somebody\nwho's young or an outsider to quickly become a candidate. - I think that that's true, and I think also in a lot\nof ways it's just not, I mean, would you wanna be President? - No. - I mean I can't be 'cause\nI wasn't born in the US, so it's easy for me to say, but. - If everyone says no, then we're get the people that we have. - No, I understand that. - So I would love to help somehow. - [David] Sure. - And I feel like there's not\neven a mechanism for helping, except through the democratic,\nthrough the voting process. But I'm just annoyed how\nlittle technology there is in the whole process, how little innovation there\nis in the whole process, all of this. - The sad thing is, this\nis written about a lot, which is there's this thing\ncalled political hobbyism. And I think there's a good chance that some of the people in my audience are political hobbyists in the sense that they follow this stuff as entertainment to some degree. And I've written a lot about how, I've read a lot and\ntalked a lot about how, okay, we vote every two\nyears or every four years in our local elections, et cetera. And then we think about\npolitics all the time. Neil Postman wrote about this in his book, Amusing Ourselves to Death. But what are you actually\ngoing to do about the kids starving in this country, and the nuclear buildup in that country? It's okay, if everybody\nrefocused their attention on their immediate communities, and that could mean any number, it could mean the town\nor city you live in, or it might mean an\nathletic club or whatever. If everybody this time they\nspent on political hobbyism, they moved somewhere else, which might put me out\nof a job, that's okay. I'm willing to lose my job because I think it would be so beneficial, then our communities would\njust be that much better, because you can actually affect change in a much more tangible way locally, whether it's, people talk about potholes, but other things as well. - Yeah, and I wish our\nsystem was more amenable to that kind of contribution. Hopefully through the\ndigital space, it would be. Let me ask you about on the\nRepublican side, Ron DeSantis, what do you think of him as a candidate running against Donald Trump? - I think in the couple of weeks before our discussion today, his campaign, which hasn't even started, has sort of started to implode. And this was something that\nI started thinking about in September, October. He really doesn't seem\nready for primetime, in the sense that just being confronted, and confronted is not even the right word, just being asked about some topics he didn't really seem\nto want to talk about. He responded in such a sort of disproportionate, unhinged way. During his recent trip to Asia, he was asked about why aren't you or why are you responding\nbut in this weird way to Trump's attacks on you? And he went into this\nweird bobblehead thing with a weird smile, and something came out\nthat didn't make any sense, and he sort of got mad at the reporter, and it was just like, if\nyou can't handle that, you can't be on a debate\nstage with Donald Trump. And again, for all my criticisms of Trump, the guy gets you on a debate stage, he can make you look pretty silly. He was recently asked about\nhis role at Guantanamo Bay when he was an officer in, I forget which branch of the armed forces. And he just sort of\nattacked the journalist asking the question, and\nit just looked very bad. And there are increasingly\nbig Republican donors who are not fans of Trump and were sort of hoping to put their eggs in the Ron DeSantis basket who are saying, this guy just doesn't have what it takes, I don't think he can do it. So I don't know if DeSantis\nwill be able to get away. Once you're polling 20\nsomething like he is, and you haven't even announced,\nit's very attractive. And he probably to some\ndegree is thinking, if I wait till 2028, I might not have this opportunity again. But Trump's polling 52, 53, which means even if DeSantis gets all of the current non-Trump vote, he has to figure out how to\ntake something more from Trump. I just don't know how he does it. - First of all, the implosion aspect, that's part of the process, isn't it? You kind of implode a bunch of times. - [David] And then rebuild yourself. - And rebuild and because the\nnew cycle kind of forgets. - It's possible. The problem is if he, the\nfirst debate is in August. So that's only a few months away, and the decision's going to\nhave to be made pretty soon. And unless he can get\na new momentum going, I just don't know how\nhe gets what he needs in order to really have a shot. - So would anyone else\nrun against Donald Trump? - It's very tough right now. I mean there are other people running. There's this guy, Vivek\nRamaswamy who's running, Nikki Haley is running. Her campaign basically dead on arrival. Trump actually does better\nin polls the more people run. When it's just him and DeSantis, that's the best scenario for DeSantis. It's not great for DeSantis,\nbut it's certainly better. But I think the difficulty is, this is a question for\nRepublicans to figure out. The people who rightly recognized in 2016 that this guy is not good for their party, still believe this guy is\nnot good for their party. But many of them recognize\nthat most of the voters are still behind him. You can always say, it's early, his polling doesn't really mean anything. Anything could happen. Something major would have to happen for Trump to lose that\nlead, if he got more, if he was arrested two more\ntimes, and had more indictments, and it just became like\nthis guy can't even campaign because he's so busy\ngoing from court to court. Maybe that would make a difference. It's really tough to imagine. - You said that there are\nthree categories of people who vote Republican, and that Trump introduced the fourth one. Can you go through the four categories? - Sure. So you've got like your\npro-business, low tax Republicans. These are mostly people like Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney has a bit of the\nsocial conservatism as well. He's Mormon and that's there. But Mitt Romney primarily, particularly as a northeast\nsort of Republican, I mean, I know Utah, but\nGovernor of Massachusetts, he is like a low tax\npro-business type guy. You've got your libertarian\ntype Republicans who are primarily about\nfreedom and liberty. Often they are actually\nmore socially Liberal where they go, I don't\ncare about gay marriage, Liberal, you know, I don't\ncare so much about abortion. And that overlapped a little bit with the Tea Party Movement in 2010, although Tea Party did\nhave a religious component, but sort of like the libertarian\nfreedom-minded folks, and then the religious Conservatives, people that support candidates like Josh Hawley, or Ted Cruz, et cetera, where their big thing are social issues. Often they actually want Christianity, being civil government. They don't want separation\nof church and state. Those are traditionally the\nthree Republican groups. The one that Trump introduced was people who just didn't\nreally pay attention to politics, but either followed celebrity, or had grievances that they\ndidn't yet have scapegoat for, and were sort of right-leaning culturally even though they didn't\nattribute that to Republicanism. And Trump was able to\nbring them into politics often for the first time as voters. They could be part of\nany of those three groups if they get more into politics or kind of be their own thing. But they're more kind of\nlike cult of personality, I'm here for Trump types. - Did it have to do anything\nabout the culture wars and the identity politics,\nall that kind of stuff? - Yeah, I mean, so in 2016\nwhen Trump mobilized them, those weren't really issues\nthe way they are now. So I think at that time, it\ncertainly was not a factor. - What was the mobilizing issue? Was it just anti-Hillary in 2016? - He did a good job on anti-Hillary, but a lot of it was identifying\nreal economic problems, wage depression, lack of\njobs in parts of the country. You know, Ohio and Indiana, Trump rightly identified\nlike we have an issue here, we don't have enough\nentrepreneurship, et cetera. But there was also a lot\nof scapegoating that was, you know, China and people coming through the US-Mexico border\nwere popular scapegoats for a lot of those problems. This gets us kind of to populism. Populism is a rhetoric, and populism as a rhetoric\ndoesn't necessarily come with particular policies. You can be a populist, a user of populist rhetoric\nand proposed solutions that would be more aligned\nwith Bernie or Tucker Carlson. Populists will often identify the plight of the middle class. The difference would be Bernie will say, we've gotta put some restrictions on how much billionaires can make, and we've gotta reinvest\nin these social programs. Tucker will say, BLM taking your house, and a brown person from\nMexico taking your job are what we need to deal with. So the the populist\nrhetoric can lend itself to very different policy, and Trump used that very\neffectively in 2016. - Why do you think Hillary Clinton was hated as intensely as she was by a certain percent of the population? It feels like that's the\nfirst election I witnessed where there's a lot of hate. Maybe I'm misremembering. I don't remember Obama, I don't\nremember the degree of hate. There was conspiracy theories that he wasn't born in this country, but I don't remember hate towards Obama. - Record death threats under Obama more than any previous President. - Towards who, towards him? - Towards him, yeah. Do you mean more hate between voters or- - Between voters. Between voters, but like that's I guess\nwhat I was speaking to, but that hate was directed\ntowards the narrative, the thread that connected\nall of that in 2016 was Hillary Clinton. - Few different things. And I'm not ranking these, these are just all\nthings that come to mind. One is Hillary Clinton had been around in the political space for a long time, from her time as First\nLady, through as Senator, Secretary of State, et cetera. So I think that there was\nenough time for different groups to develop an antipathy towards\nher for different reasons. So time. Secondly, Trump's\nbranding of her as crooked was very effective, where there were so many people demanding that she be imprisoned. If you ask them what is\nthe crime, they don't know. But she should definitely be locked up. That became a very big thing. The email story as it were, and James Comey doing\na second public event about that investigation, even though there wasn't\nany actual news about it, just doing a second event\nabout it at the last minute, I think hurt her and\nalso generated some hate. And I don't find Hillary Clinton\nto be particularly likable, although I voted for her, I thought she was the better candidate. And I think that there are others who also didn't find her\nparticularly likable. Those are a lot of impediments\nto becoming President. - Well I was trying to understand why there's so many conspiracy theories about Clintons in general, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. And I, maybe I'm not\nresearched well enough. - [David] Of the why of it. - The why of it, actually the extent of\nthe conspiracy theories, the sort the conspiracy theories that they've killed a lot of\npeople, this kind of stuff. - It's hard for me to speak to them because I'm aware that they exist, but I'm not an expert in them, because they seem so obviously baseless, to the degree that I've\nresearched them a little bit, and then I move on, and you know, it's been years since I've looked at this stuff. I know there's the Seth Rich one, and there's the Clinton body count one. I think there's one connected to Epstein if I recall correctly. There's all sorts of these different ones. Without speaking to any\nof them specifically, because I'm not the expert\non Clinton conspiracies, it does seem as though\nthis stuff for so long has generated an audience. I mean, I remember in the supermarket when Bill Clinton was\nPresident at the checkout seeing the tabloids, and there were stuff about\nHillary birthed an alien baby, and, you know, all the, it seems like it's been\ntitillating to people for a very long time. - Well, another question from\nReddit, speaking of aliens. I would be curious to hear David's views on conspiracies and conspiracy theories, the extent to which real\nconspiracies happen, and why conspiracies that have\nlittle evidence behind them managed to be so compelling\nto people regardless. Also, please bring up aliens and UAPs. - [David] Okay, where do we start? - The conspiracy, so what are, in general, as a person who thinks about politics, thinks about this world, like where do conspiracy\ntheories fit in for you? - I think there have been conspiracies, and by conspiracies, I'm\nusing a colloquial definition, which is basically individuals\nworking together to, in a clandestine way, impact or affect some kind\nof event or phenomenon very, very broadly. I mean, certainly that\nthose things have happened. To pick, to jump around\nto some of the things that were in there, I think the reason that\nconspiracy theories are so compelling, is that it's really tough\nfor a lot of people to accept there are random events, not\npredictable specifically. At a stochastic level, we\nmight be able to predict them, but specifically unpredictable,\nbad events in many ways. I could be the victim\nof one, or you could, or my family could. That's really scary to a lot\nof people understandably so. And for some people it's less scary and more soothing in a way to say, there aren't really\nrandom events like this. Somebody planned it. And if we had just known who planned it, it just could have been stopped because we would've known exactly when. That's just a psychological level, easier to accept for people. And I get that to some degree, because listen, it's not\nthe most exciting thing that everything can just be going fine and something absolutely\nhorrible happens and kills, who knows, some number of people or. So I think that's the biggest at attractor to a lot of these conspiracy theories. It doesn't apply to all of 'em though. - But yeah, but there's still\nkind of a basic understanding of human nature where people, some people are greedy and want power, and are corrupted by power. So there's kind of these\ncompelling narratives that stick that, I don't know, the\nvaccine is a opportunity for a powerful billionaire\nto implant chips into you so he can control you further. - [David] Right. - It doesn't seem, what do I want to say? It's like, for some reason, that doesn't seem as crazy as it should, because you think like maybe\nHollywood contributes to that. But you think, yeah, you\ncould imagine an evil person, a person that wants more\ncontrol, more power, and is also at the same time\nable to convince themselves, as history shows, that they're actually\nhave the best interest of the populace in mind, that they're trying to\ndo good for the world. So they do evil while trying to do good. And you can kind of imagine it. So it's like, why not? And you listen to people\nin power, authorities, they kind of look and\nsound shady, you know? Like the transparency,\nespecially the older ones. I think younger folks are better at being like real and transparent, and just like revealing their\nflaws and the basic humanity. But people that are a little bit older, in the positions of power,\nthey're more polished. They're more like, it feels like they're\npresenting a narrative, what the truth is hidden in the shadows. - I don't think there's\nanything wrong with suspecting, maybe a public figure isn't\ngiving me the full story. Totally reasonable thing to question. I don't think there's anything wrong with exploring a lot of\nthese different things. I think the problem becomes, and I know you've talked about this in so many different\nways with other guests, the problem becomes when we\nlose a shared understanding of how we would assess whether\nany of these things are true, and then both alleged evidence\nand then absence of evidence, both become supportive\nof the conspiracy theory. Because if there's bad evidence, you manipulate it and\nsay it's good evidence. If there's no evidence, you say the evidence was obviously hidden by the people who carried\nout the thing or whatever. So unless we can have\na shared understanding of how we would determine what's true, these are common conversations often between atheists\nand religious folks. How can we deter, like,\nis my faith in something or my desire for something to be true a good way to evaluate whether it is true? They're really similar questions. - Well, let me ask you\nabout Trump on that front, about the election, 2020 election. And maybe the better question\nis about January 6th. Do you think January 6th was a big deal? - I do. - [Lex] How big of a deal? - Compared to what. - Civil War. - I think it was less of a\nbig deal than the Civil War. - [Lex] Okay. - No, I mean, so you, well that it's a very\ninteresting thing though, right? Because we have not only the event, that's clever actually. It's not only the event,\nbut it's what led up to it, and what has happened since, and did it change what is\nconsidered on the table that citizens can, should or might do if they disagree with the\nresults of an election? So I think that there are\nfurther reaching consequences than just the six hour\nperiod on January 6th, a bigger or smaller\ndeal than the Civil War? And there's so much wrapped up into it. Many conspiracy theories flowed\nfrom January 6th as well. 60 Minutes recently featured\na guy named Ray Epps who was targeted by some on the right, claiming that he was an\ninstigator or an agent of the FBI or something along those lines. There were people claiming that no real it was like a No True\nScotsman sort of thing. Like Trump supporters wouldn't riot, so by definition it must have been Antifa, police let 'em in, or\npolice were, you know, all these different things. I think it was a big deal in a lot of ways because it completely made\nus have to go back to the top to say, okay, what are the parameters of valid discussion and\nactivism in the United States? - But what aspect of the\nJanuary 6th was bad for you? - [David] Well, I mean. - If you're thinking of\nfrom a big philosophical, political perspective, so presumably the number of people hurt and the number of people who died is not the only metric to consider here. - Absolutely. I think the sum total of what it means about how the United States operates is what's most concerning. And I'll kind of just like\nflesh it out a little bit. So summer of 2020, Trump's already saying\nthey're going to cheat. Now the polling is close, but it shows that Biden's\nin a good position, people aren't happy with Trump. Any reasonable person would look and say, it's gonna be close, but Biden certainly wouldn't\nbe a crazy thing if Biden won. Trump's already saying they're gonna cheat with mail-in ballots, or they're gonna cheat with early voting, or they're gonna cheat with machines, or we should do only in person or whatever else the case may be. We have the election. We knew in certain states how the vote count was going to go. Some states stopped counting at 10:00 PM, some states count all of\nthe mail-in stuff up front, some don't. Everything was completely predictable. At 2:00 AM, Trump comes\nout and says, I won. Okay, but where are you getting that, Sir, as he claims people always refer to him, where are you getting that? And with that statement,\nimmediately we see that there is a large\nportion of this country that either is unable or unwilling to say, wait a second, the polling all said this was a real possibility. The counting schedules\nare all being adhered to, but Trump won? That doesn't make any sense. That doesn't happen. It builds. People are donating millions\nto Trump for supposed audits, which nobody can define, and\nlawsuits which go nowhere. And it builds and builds and builds. And we have a total separation\nfrom a factual reality. There's no reason to think,\nby December 1st, right, give three weeks to look\nthrough some of this stuff. By December 1st, there's no\nreasonable case to be made that Trump actually won. But it doesn't end there. It goes into, maybe we can just like\nsend different electors, even though Biden won\nArizona, let's just like send, I don't remember how many\nelectors it is in Arizona. Let's just like send\nRepublican electors to say, we vote for Trump. But that's not democracy. That's not the way the system works. Let's make sure we're ready. Ready for what exactly? And then it builds to, maybe Mike Pence can\njust like prevent Biden from being President, or maybe we can just\ninterfere in this other way. And then it gets to, let's\nbreak into the Capitol. It's the height of saying we\nno longer comport ourselves attached to what is a\nverifiable factual reality. And when we no longer do that, we're also willing to commit\ncrimes, property crimes, violent crimes, okay, to different degrees in order to try to have\nsomething other than democracy. It wouldn't be democracy if any of those things had happened. - Yeah, I think it's not the height of it. I think there's still a case to be made that that did not leave\nthe realm of protest, versus a violation of the\nprinciples of democracy. So to me, the height of what\ncould happen on January 6th, is if Donald Trump was\nmuch better executive, he could take control of the military. - [David] If it had succeeded. - No, not even succeeded. The attempt would've been more empowered. - [David] I understand. - So like, the way not to bring\nup Hitler every other word, which is something your subreddit had also told me not to do. - [David] Okay. - He's kind of an important figure and it's interesting to\nstudy that moment in history 'cause it reveals so\nmuch about human nature, and that all of us are\ncapable of good and evil. But thank you dear subredditor or redditor for your contribution to the conversation. I will keep bringing up\nHitler and the Third Reich and I'll keep bringing up Stalin. There's so much to learn from that. Anyway, the, an effective\npracticed authoritarian could roll the tanks out\ninto the city streets to establish order. And in so doing pause\nthe process of democracy as opposed to a few\nprotestors breaking in, to a questionably protected building. - I agree that what you're\nsaying would be worse. I don't want to use it to minimize what the protestors were intent on doing. They failed fortunately. - But to you, the intention was there too. - Well, the intention was\nTrump should remain President. That's the intention. And to what length they\nwould've been willing to go if by the evening, early evening, they, you know, were sort of\nlike forced out, I don't know. I agree with you that Trump\ntrying to use the military would absolutely be worse. You know, there's these reports that he tried to seize voting machines, which is kind of funny 'cause it's like, once you get the machine at Mar-a-Lago, what do you do with it\nexactly, I don't know. There's a like a comedic element to Trump sitting around\nwith voting machines. But he did float trying\nto do some other things. I don't believe there's reporting that he actually tried\nto use the military. - I wonder to what degree\nthis opened the door to further things like this\nwith other candidates on, you know, even in the\nDemocratic Party also. Do you think there would be\nmore and more questioning of the election results? - There has been already. It's very clearly the playbook. Kari Lake lost, she ran for Governor in\nArizona 2022, she lost. What I mean by that is her\nopponent received more votes. It's like very clear what\nit means that she lost. She insists to this day\nthat she won, to this day. She did the same grift\nTrump did about donate, we've got a case, we won in the case. You didn't win. They just set a court date. Like that's not, you know? Lies upon grift upon lies. So they did it then. It is, it's extraordinarily saddening, but it seems like this is now going to be part of the playbook. - Do you think people on the\nleft will start doing it? - I don't have a reason to believe that that is going to happen, but I'm not going to say it never could. It certainly could. People on the left could\nstart using it as a tactic. Right now, there's not a sign\nthat that's going to happen, but it's certainly could. My expectation is, and\nI'm not a betting man, but I would bet money. If Joe Biden loses in November of 2024, he will say, I lost, he\nwill call the winner. He will concede and he\nwill leave the White House in an orderly fashion. - You don't think there will\nbe claims of a hacked election? The ability to hack elections is becoming more and more effective with the developments on the\nartificial intelligence side. - The difficulty is\nyou're basically saying, will something happen without me knowing anything\nabout the election? Imagine there really was\nevidence of a hacked election, then I would want those claims to be made. But the way elections\nhave gone in the past, I don't expect that that's a\nclaim that would be made, no. - Speaking of evidence of\nthings that were claimed, what do you think about\nthe Hunter Biden laptop, or as you tweeted, The\nLaptop From Hell TM. - [David] Right. - To what degree was this\nlaptop story important and to what degree was it not? - At this point, I have said many times, if there is any reason to\nbelieve that Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Naomi Biden, Jill\nBiden, Hillary, Obama, Doug, if there's any evidence any\nof them committed a crime, they should be investigated,\nthey should be charged, and they should be tried, period. The Hunter Biden laptop thing has been floating around for so long, and we still have zero\nactual pieces of evidence of any crime, particularly\ninvolving Joe Biden. There's the claim from some\nthat references to the big guy, are about Joe Biden getting\n10% for some illicit, it's been years they've been saying this, they've not been able to bring\nforward any evidence on it. So my assessment of the\nHunter Biden laptop is, it seems to mostly be a story about nude images released\nwithout someone's consent, which is illegal in most states, and violates Twitter's own policies. That's the main story to me. Beyond that, I don't know how many people have a copy of this hard\ndrive at this point. Rudy had it. Tucker, do you remember when\nTucker, this is unbelievable. Tucker said that he mailed\nhimself a copy, a USB stick. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it got lost in the mail. You have the mother load\nproving the criminality of Joe and Hunter Biden, and you just dropped it off with a stamp and it got lost in the mail. You don't have a backup copy, you don't- So I'm ready for the\nevidence to come forward. Hunter Biden has nothing to do with Joe Biden's administration. But as a person who, if\nhe committed a crime, charge him, investigate 'em, whatever. But it's getting, it's\nalmost getting satirical, the degree to which they're talking about the Hunter Biden laptop. - Well what do you think about the social media aspect of\nthis, that story got censored, and what do you think\nabout censorship in general on social media that that\nstory during an important time in the electoral process got censored? - So I, as a matter of principle, I think we have to define\nwhat we mean by censorship. But I'm against censorship,\nshort of illegal content, I guess is the way I would put it. I do respect a company's\nright to have terms of service and to enforce them as long\nas they're not illegal. If Twitter were to say, we don't publish content\nfrom Jewish people. Okay, now we've got a\nproblem on our hands. But what is dubious to me is the claim that had people been able to\nsee Hunter Biden's genitals, they would've voted for Trump. Which I know it's like,\nDavid, you're making light of- And, but at the end of the day, what exactly is the claim that if you had known\nmore about Hunter Biden, I guess allegedly hiring prostitutes and having a drug problem\nand seeing pictures, you wouldn't have voted for Joe Biden? I mean, I know me as a\nvoter, I don't feel that way. - I think it's less about\nthe content of the story and about the actions of\na social media company to control what you see\nand what you don't see. So you could imagine\na social media company like Facebook and Twitter\nmaking the same kind of decision about a more impactful story than a few dick pics on a laptop. - Well, I think if that happened, then my view might be different, right? But I do, my general view though on the Hunter Biden story is, had the articles not\ncontained those images that were illegal in many states and violated Twitter's policies, I would say publish it, absolutely. I don't think it would've had an impact, but I would be in favor of it being, of the links being allowed, 100%. - Okay, you mentioned Tucker. What do you think about\nTucker getting fired from Fox? You're a media person\nthat works independently. - [David] Yes. - Tucker was a media person\nwho doesn't work independently. - [David] Right. - Yeah, what do you think about\nthat particular situation? Is it representative of some big shift that's happening in mainstream media? - What would the shift be? - Basically, mainstream media freaking out because the funding is getting less and\nless and less and less. And there's gonna give more power to individual commentators, basically Tucker Carlson\njust starting a podcast, and a YouTube channel. - I think that's what he should do. I think that's the most profitable path rather than maybe going\nto work for Newsmax or whatever the case may be. But the firing fundamentally was not a politically oriented firing that suggests Fox News is\nchanging its tune politically in any way. There's no evidence of that whatsoever. Tucker Carlson basically\nbecame a legal problem for Fox News. There's really four points to it. One is the $787 and a half\nmillion settlement with Dominion partially was because of the claims that went out on Tucker Carlson's program. So to some degree, Tucker's\nprogram was a prominent node of the problematic claims that became the subject of the lawsuit. That's number one. Number two, Smartmatic, which is another voting machine company, still has a similarly sized\nlawsuit against Fox News, based on the exact same sorts of claims. It may cost Fox News again. So this is now two problems that Tucker's a big contributor to. Number three, former Tucker\nstaffer has brought a lawsuit, and I don't remember the exact claims, but I know that there are claims of different types of discrimination. It seems like it has legs, and that may be a third payout\nrelated to Tucker Carlson. And based on the 60 Minutes\npiece from a few weeks ago, Ray Epps saying, Tucker ruined his life by\nfomenting conspiracies about him around January 6th. That's ripe for another lawsuit. So to me, Tucker's firing was\na risk mitigation strategy of many that will be employed as these lawsuits come forward. There's no evidence that\nit's because Fox didn't like, and what we mean by that,\nwho are we talking about? Rupert Murdoch doesn't\nlike, or the, I don't know. But I don't have any reason to believe it's because Tucker's ideas\nwere no longer welcome on Fox. Certainly the audience liked them. - So interesting, it's not about, it's not even about the ratings, it's about just the legal costs. - Fox is interesting, the ratings question is\ninteresting, because Fox, unlike most other or every\nother cable news channel, they negotiate a fee from\nevery cable subscriber. If you have Fox News as a channel, even if you don't watch it,\nFox gets a little bit of money. They are dramatically less\ndependent on ad revenue than CNN and MSNBC. So the ratings question\nis an interesting one, but Fox's position is different on that. - Another question from Reddit. \"Both sides are the same\", in quotes, is a meme notion that\nhas spread far and wide in American political\ndiscourse on the internet. To what extent do you agree\nor disagree with this notion and why do you think it is so popular? Now, this Reddit comment also says that podcasts like Russell\nBrand and Joe Rogan, or the legendary comic George Carlin, are examples of big\nproponents of this notion, all of which I kind of disagree with. Russell Brand, Joe Rogan and\nGeorge Carlin claim that-- - [David] Say both sides the same. - The same, and use that, you know, all politicians are\ncrooked, and they suck, and this kind of thing. I don't know if that's\ntrue, maybe George Carlin. Anyway, let's leave that aside. - [David] Yeah. - To what degree do you think, do you agree with this notion\nthat both sides are the same, left and right, the crooked\ncorrupt politicians, they do what politicians do? - I don't agree that it's the same. I think there are different\nfactions that like to say that for different reasons. There are some individuals\nwho want to present themselves as kind of being of above the\nfray of partisan politics. And so I call it enlightened centrism. - [Lex] Do you mean that\npositively or negatively? - No, I mean it negatively, yeah. It's a bit of a pejorative. The idea that I am not going to fall for being a Democrat or a Republican. I can see that these are just\ntwo sides of the same coin, equally bad, lying to\nevery, okay, so that's one. It's sort of like it's\npopular at dinner parties in some circles to go, I'm, both all these politicians,\nyou know, left and right. So that's one side of it. The other side of it\nis that it's often used when your side has really stepped in it, it's a popular way to acknowledge that your side has done something wrong, but while framing it as\nit's not uniquely wrong, and it's not worse than\nwhat anybody else does. And I find that it's one of the lamest and most kind of\ncringe-inducing things to hear because of the what comes next. And usually what comes next is\nnot a good accurate criticism of something that took place, and a discussion of how\nto solve a real problem that we have. I find it a conversation stifler. It also is used to kind\nof suppress voter turnout. Not actively, it's not that\nthe people who say that go around saying don't vote. But the idea of course is\nthe more people that believe that it doesn't really make a\ndifference who you vote for, it's going to suppress voter turnout. And I want voter turnout\nto be as high as possible, not as low as possible, so I also dislike it for that reason. - So is it possible to\nsay that one side is worse than the other in modern\ncurrent political climate? - Listen, I'm a person on the left. I'm not pretending to come here as, and not knowing that my view is biased, because I'm a person of the left. If you ask Ben Shapiro, he'll\ntell you something different. I think in 2023, sum total, the influence of the American right wing, if the American right wing were\nto get everything it wants, it would be a horrifying reality. If the left were to get\neverything it wants, we'd have to figure out a few things, including exactly how we\npay for certain programs. But they're mostly noble goals. And I believe that they\nare more supportive of an individual self-determining\nwhat they wanna do in life and how they wanna live, and is more in line with the\nidea of freedom and liberty than what the right is\ncurrently proposing. That's my view. And of course people will\ndisagree with me and they, no, we get the freedom and liberty the way that the right wants to do it. Okay, well we can have that conversation. - So I think you've\nimplied in your answer, it was kind of focused on policy. It felt like it was focused on policy. There's other stuff\nthat people worry about. - [David] Sure. - Particularly with the left, what maybe termed, the woke mind virus. - Where have I heard, who's\nusing that term a lot now? I'm trying to think. - I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Not sure where it comes up. But the cultural aspect\nof this, that, you know, if you give a lot of power\nto people on the left, like as you gave as an example, there would be a lot of kind of censorship and suppression of speech, and a kind of dividing up of a society of who's allowed to, basically a reallocation of\nresources, not based on merit, but based on some kind\nof high ethical notions of what is right. And only a very small\npercent of the population gets to decide what is\nfair, what is right, which is, you know. - We already have a small\nportion of the population society and fair, okay. - But I don't know how many\ndifferent ways I can say kind of a negative characterization\nof folks on the left when we're now comparing it just as a, to play devil's advocate. - [David] Sure. - So is that something\nthat you worry about? So setting policies aside, wokeism. - [David] Yes. - How big of a problem is it? - This is a great conversation. So two sides of it. Okay, we have new polling\nthat seems to suggest so-called wokeism is kind of more popular in the United States than anti-wokeism. And I'll tell you what I mean by that. This is the less interesting part, we'll go to the more\ninteresting part in a second. Sometimes what people mean by wokeism is an overreaction to\na perceived injustice that goes beyond what would\nbe fair and equitable. There was this really interesting poll and it asked questions like, for example, do you believe society has gone too far, not far enough, or just\nabout the right amount in dealing with issues\naffecting the trans community? The woke position, which is\nsociety hasn't gone far enough, was far more popular\nthan we've gone too far. Now the right wing media narrative is we've gone way too far,\nthis is out of control. And there are lots of\nother similar answers. It's not a huge margin. A lot of these are like\n58 to 42, 60 to 40. It's not like 90 to 10. But by a small margin, the\nso-called woke perspective, of we actually haven't yet done enough to fix some of these issues\nis a little bit more popular. So if we went back to DeSantis, this is part of why I think\nDeSantis is anti-woke agenda may just be a political misstep. - That's a really interesting result. I wonder how the questions are framed, but it's still interesting, nevertheless, no matter what to hear that, people are, majority of\npeople in America are woke, not in the negative sense of the word. - The poll didn't use the term woke. - [Lex] Right. - This is a critical thing. - [Lex] Let's use the\nterm woke positively. - The term has kind of been perverted. Four years ago when the\nterm was started to be used, I would've said, oh yeah, woke just means like I have become aware of problems that are bigger than any one\nperson can fix for themselves that relate to the system. I think that's what, and we might disagree on which problems fall into that category, but\nlike, it was kind of benign. I think now it just means\nlike outrageously left wing, maybe even with socialist\nor Marxist undertones, it's become a pejorative at this point. - But also like bullies, like people-- - [David] Sure, censorers. - Yeah, but people that go\naround calling others racist sometimes oftentimes without\nany proof or justification. - [David] Fair. - But that's a few folks on Twitter. You're saying like the\npolling is starting to show that like no, there's still, most of Americans still\ncare about these issues and wanna improve, and\nwanna make progress. - I think that's the case and they wanna do it in a genuine way that doesn't suppress or oppress anybody. But now let me get to, like to what degree do\nI think that actual, when it goes too far is a problem? It absolutely exists. We can find instances of\nwhere this exists on the left. I've been told many times that as a Jewish Argentinian\nimmigrant to the United States, I actually don't qualify\nas oppressed enough because Jews are privileged now in the US, and my family had just enough\nmoney to leave Argentine. So there's this kind of like\noppression Olympics thing where I've been told you\ndon't get to comment, for example, like a topic in\nthe Latino community now is, are you familiar with Latinx? Okay, in Spanish, there's\nan analogous movement where words by their nature\nsort of like have a gender. So like the word for friend is amigo, but if it's a woman, you would say amiga. So right from there, you can tell the gender\nthat we're talking about. And if it's a mixed group, you say amigos, it's the male with an S,\nbut it could include both. There's a movement now which\nwants to do away with that and put the letter E in. It's a new word, okay? It's a gender neutral word. Amiges, totally new. I don't like that. And I don't know anyone, no\none in my family uses it. And I think it's kind of\nlike a strange imposition from someone kind of with a\nsolution in search of a problem. I've been told, you\nmoved to the US long ago, and like, your English is\ngood, and like you look white. And so like, you don't\nget to weigh in on that. That I think is an example,\nif I understand correctly, of the type of thing you're talking about. I'm kind of being bullied. I'm fine, I'm surviving fine, but I'm being bullied\nover it and disqualified, and saying, you don't get\nto speak on this issue. All of those example, all of that stuff I am completely against. And I tell people on the left, we're actually hurting our\nown movement with this stuff. I just don't think it's as\nbig as some others believe. - You don't think it's\nan existential threat to our civilization in the west, to west civilization? - No, I don't. And I mean, look, we've\ngot a Biden administration, I see Biden as center left. Those who see Biden as extreme far left, this stuff has played\nalmost no role whatsoever in the first two plus years\nof his administration. - There's people that see him as far left? - There's people on the right who, I mean, Trump says Biden's a\nMarxist Socialist Communist. - I haven't heard that because I don't think that\nwould stick very much. - He said that at every rally, yeah. I'm so jealous that you\ndon't watch these things. - I love how deeply\nresearched you are in Trump. I can only imagine how good\nyour Trump impression is at this point. - [David] It's not very,\nsadly, it's not good. - It's not, all right. - No, but, and I'll say\none other thing on that. You know, take trans, because trans, just to talk about it a little bit, we haven't dealt with it much. The trans issue has become huge, I believe because the\nright is obsessed with it. The right is very much not\nconcerned with gay men anymore. It used to be that gay men, it's like, oh, we have to stop gay men\nfrom adopting, and unnatural, and pedophiles. Now it's trans, it's\ndrag shows, et cetera. I do think that there is\na fair question to say, how do we deal with trans women in a very small short list of sports? That's real, okay? My view though is I go,\nokay, we have all issues. We have issues related to\ngender and sexual orientation. We have issues related to trans. Within that, we have specifically sports. You can eliminate from that, trans men, nobody's worried, right,\nabout women, biological women who are trans. And then when you say, it's only in certain\nsports that it matters. Hey, I'm right there. I think it's a complicated question. I don't know how we deal with it. I would ask leagues that have\nexperienced with this already and whatever. The problem I have is\npretending that the vanguard of left wing politics right now is trying to force\ntrans women into sports. It's like, it's just not the big issue that the right is reacting as if it were. - But perhaps because of the right, it's forcing the left to\ncontinue discussing it. I mean, I feel like it, even in institutions,\neven at universities, it feels like these ideas of diversity, inclusion, and equity are taking some of the air out of the room of what a university should\nalso care about, which is merit. And it feels like reprioritization is going a little too far the other way, meaning prioritizing this kind of amorphous concept\nof diversity is moving away, is giving power to people\nthat don't care about merit and are just wanna bully\npeople with a big stick that says racism, or\nsexism, or anti-diversity. And it kind of suffocates the\npeople that care about merit, about meritocracy, about inspiring people from all kinds of backgrounds to succeed. And it's just, you kind of observe that. I'm sure that happens in\nall kinds of institutions. And the concern, I think the people that\nare concerned about wokeism are concerned about at scale, what impact does that have on a society, when there's so much\nconversation about racism, and a pressure not to talk about merit. Like who's the actual\ngood person in the room, the best person in the room? - Generically, that's a concern to me. The degree to which it's happening\nat different institutions I think, is worthy of exploration. I know people who work in academia that are getting out of academia because they don't like the\nenvironment on their campuses for exactly the reason you're saying. So it exists, there is\nno question about it. I also think that the idea\nof a perfect meritocracy is maybe not necessarily the goal in the sense that when you\ntalk about perfect meritocracy, someone wrote a book about this who I interviewed about\na year and a half ago and whose name escapes me. There are problems with\na perfect meritocracy. I think what we want to do is generate roughly equal\nopportunity for people, understanding that there is going to be an outcome on a gradient or a bell curve, allowing people generally speaking, to determine the path\nthat they want to take and giving them, if it's possible, the ability to pursue that\nwithout suppressing, limiting. I mean this is like relatively\nuncontroversial stuff among, I would argue 95% of the left, with the caveats of what\nyou're talking about, which I agree exist. - And it would be nice\nto know the actual data. Sometimes people blow stuff\nout of the proportion. But it's hard to measure\nhow much self-censorship happens at university campuses. It's hard. - That's true. I think also it's sort of like the pitbull bite stories thing, where when a pitbull bites a person, it's more likely to be reported on because it fits a certain narrative. And there are right wing publications that are very interested\nin making this seem as if it is an epidemic. I'm the first to say it\nis happening to a degree. I don't know the degree\nthat it's happening to. I know a lot of people in academia, only a couple of them\nsay that it's an issue. - Would they say it though,\nif they believed it? - I think they would say it, to me, these are just personal contacts. It's not like I'm gonna go blabbing. - To push back, I kind of agree with you, but at the same time, most, I mean I'm deeply connected in academia, I have huge number of colleagues. Most people self-censor by\nnot thinking about it at all. They're like, screw it. - [David] That's deeper. - Whatever.\n- Yeah. - I'm just gonna focus on\nthe thing I love doing, which is the work. And they don't think about, they basically remove themselves from politics and social issues\nand they just kind of say, I'm gonna do my engineering,\nI'm gonna do my mathematics. - Sure. The problem with that is it's kind of, you can't go anywhere\nfurther to figure it out. It's sort of like, there's this funny clip\nwhere Jordan Peterson says, even atheists are actually religious, they just don't know it. And it's like, it's hard\nto test that, you know? I don't know. Okay, I mean, I don't- But it's a fair point. I mean, there may be some people, if it has become so toxic for some people, they may have repressed it way\ndown into their subconscious, but I don't know how we would know that. - But you know symptoms of it, because when certain people\nspeak up kind of lightly, and then 19 year old or\na 20 year old responds and is outraged, the fact that the administration listens to that 19 and 20 year old, and then reprimands whoever\nspoke up a little bit, that's a really dangerous sign to me. And I don't really care about these, like, so I'm more with you. I don't think it's a big\nissue, but then I notice it. I wonder, wait a minute. Would this kind of environment allow a young Noam Chomsky to be around? Would this environment allow like a, I don't know, like a what\ntenure was designed for, which is to have controversial thinkers, and not kind of weird\ncontroversial thinkers, but really people that challenge things that should be challenged? - Yeah, I sympathize\nwith that significantly. I always try to look at specific examples. And sometimes I'll look at\npeople, I'll ask for them, and people will send me five. And one of them is a\nlegit bonafide example of what we're talking about. And four are kind of like, eh, there was a complaint\nand it was investigated, but the teacher's tenure\nwas never in jeopardy, and I don't know that I chalked\nthis up to a big woke event. What do you think the kind of apparatus of the four year degree in college is going to look like in 20 years? - Oh, that's, I mean,\nwe're like day by day, that seems to be changing with GPT. I don't know if you've gotten a chance to interact with ChatGPT. - Absolutely. My entire show now is written by ChatGPT. - I mean there's, that's partially a joke. - It is only because it\nstopped looking at the internet in 2021. If it was current, I could\ncompletely just tune it out. No, I'm kidding. But it's a fascinating tool. - And it's changing the nature of how we do homework assignments, it's changing the nature of how we learn, how we look up new information,\nhow we explore information, how we care about things\nwe're interested in. I think it, I don't think we'll have value for university degree in\n20 years the way we do now. I just think it changes everything. I think language models, I mean Google search has already, and Wikipedia has already transformed, I would say our civilization. But it's, there was still a\nvalue for basic education. I don't, I think that starts\nto dissipate with ChatGPT. So I don't, I don't know. I really don't think there's a university the way we think of a\nuniversity in 20, 30 years. - I mean, I have a personal interest in it in that my daughter is 10 months old. And I'm doing the 529 account. I'm going through the motions as if. But I also recognize, you know, if she went to the schools I went to just with the rate of tuition increase, you're talking 200K a\nyear by the time she's 18. And what happens with\nwages relative to that? This is like separate from\nthe technological thing. And in my mind I'm thinking, is this going to continue\nbeing the right path? What I would love to see is so many people that I interact with, just by virtue of what I do, have no foundation in critical thinking, epistemology, philosophy,\nmedia or literacy. And if there were some way to make that the core\nof some basic education that everybody's receiving,\nwhich goes beyond, you know, ChatGPT can do so many things, but I've not yet seen good examples of how it can teach you to think. Maybe you have a different\nview on how ChatGPT can teach a user to think. But those skills seem to be so lacking in so many of the people I interact with. If there's any positive change to come from a changing\ndynamic with higher education, I wish it would be to\ngo in that direction. - Well, no ChatGPT is actually much better at helping me think than any educator, even books that I've encountered. Because it's very good at\npresenting the full picture, even better than a lot of\nWikipedia articles, you know, on questions like, did\nthe virus leak from a lab, did the COVID leak from a lab? It just presents to you all\nthe different hypotheses, the amount of evidence available to it. It's like a full calm\nobjective picture of it. There's no partisanship. It's like a really nice list\nof things that's available. - But I guess what I mean is, does it tell you how as a thinking human, you should evaluate the strength of each of the paragraphs\nit presents to you? - [Lex] You can literally ask it. - You can ask it to do, okay, yeah. - And then it's actually a fun, it's fun to ask ChatGPT that question 'cause you'll get good answers. And so you'll basically\nhave a kind of Socratic, like a deep intimate, like great podcast style\nconversation with an AI system every single day for as\nmany hours as you want, especially as it improves as, and as the interfaces\nby which you communicate with the thing improves. So yeah, I think it will do exactly that, which is teach you how to think, because you will offload the\nmemory of facts and equations, and whatever else school teaches you, you'll offload that to AI. And instead you'll be\nusing your human mind, which is what it for now\nat least uniquely good at, which is asking good questions, thinking through the\ncomplexities of issues when there's multiple\nperspectives on it, all of that. - Well then I stand corrected maybe. Then I don't know what college\nis gonna be in 20 years. - Well, but you were sort\nof commenting, I see, to the financial aspect of it. Like why does it even\nmake sense at this point? - [David] Yeah. - I am thinking about the\ntransformative effects of AI and starts to ask, what is even education? - [David] Right. - What are you supposed, what\nis the purpose of education? So one is to give you kind\nof a background knowledge on a bunch of different topics. But the other is to discover the thing you're truly passionate about, and the thing you're really good at, such that you can make money, and you can contribute to society, and have a fulfilling life. - Yeah, and I think and also learning to interact with other people. With how relationships are built, socializing, and so many\nother things as well. - But is that, you know, that is the big value of university. - [David] Yeah. - And maybe should be\ncalled something else. - Can you get that for less\nthan 200K a year somewhere else? Yeah, no, it's a fair question. - [David] Kind of social club. - And you know, one of the\nthings I think about also is, people who are well connected, I mean this has always\nbeen, this isn't new, right? But if you're well connected, and you have a sort of drive\ntowards entrepreneurship, and doing your own thing, and you're not pursuing a field that is very licensing-dependent\nlike medicine or law, getting started four years\nearlier with some internships can be a privilege in some cases. But again, that path is available to the people that would likely do well regardless of whether\nthey went to college. And so it's a very privileged,\nself-selected group anyway. - Another question from Reddit. Ask David to explain why\nAmerican style libertarianism is an unserious philosophy. - I don't know what they mean by American style libertarianism. I've talked before about these\nkind of utopian libertarians where, you know, we have,\nwe don't have police, you just kind of like\nhire a for-profit company if you want protection. And if there's a conflict between two of these\nprivate security companies, then I don't know, you\nfigure it out somehow. - [David] So it's almost like anarchism, so take it to that degree. - Yeah, if by, I don't know\nwhat the question means by that American style libertarianism. But in general my problems\nwith libertarianism as it is often presented, come from the work of sociology\nas well as human psychology. Which is the reality\nthat once you get a group that's bigger than 150 people, you really have to start\ncentralizing some decisions. Unless you're gonna subdivide\nthe 150 endlessly into 275s that now no longer have contact, but then that's not really\none society, now it's two. I've not seen good evidence. And I've read a fair bit about this, that once you get beyond 150, you can keep all decisions decentralized. And once you say some things\nneed to be centralized, then it's a matter of how you do it. And it's going to be some\nversion of government that conflicts with\naspects of libertarianism. - Well it could be companies, right? It could be more market-driven, which is the idea of\nanarchism that you're not, you don't give any centralized entity a monopoly over violence. You know, and then if you think that the markets are\nefficient at delivering, especially in this 21st\ncentury and beyond, where a market could have\nperfect information about people. So one of the issues is that\nyou can manipulate markets because there's not perfect information. But now in a digital age, we can be higher bandwidth\nparticipants in the market. So if you're choosing between\ndifferent security companies, are you choosing between\ndifferent providers and different services, you could do so more\nefficiently and more effectively in the digital space. So you could kind of imagine it, but we haven't successfully\ndone it without governments. - Yeah, and I think there's a practical, once you get beyond 150, you also start specializing. It just is a matter of fact. You don't have, everybody\nisn't growing their own food. Some people grow the food and\nother people do other things. And you come across a lot of the problems that started at the\nagricultural revolution. And whether you say that it's a company that's solving it or a government, the problems are going to be very similar. And I've not read anything\nthat to my satisfaction explains how you deal with that. - Well there's underlying\nprinciples of libertarianism, which is putting priority at the freedom of the individual, right? And that's a compelling notion. - Yeah, whenever I do these\nvarious political compass things that put you on two axes, on the authoritarian libertarian axis, I am way down on the libertarian\nside as a left libertarian. So my tendencies are\nalways anti-authoritarian, and towards that option\nwhen it makes sense. So I sympathize with that a lot. - Another question from Reddit. Ask David what issues he\ndisagrees with you on. Is there something you-- - I have no idea. - Okay, that's good. There you go, there's no issues. Perfect agreement. - What's your view on Tesla? - That's a good opportunity to ask. What do you think is strengths\nand weaknesses of Elon Musk? You mentioned Twitter. Have you paid your $8? - I have not paid my $8. I don't see the point in paying for it. I have no problem paying for services. I use a ton of services. I'll try the free, I'll go to the paid. Right now, so the way I used\nto use the Verified feed was I would post a tweet, and then the next day when I, you know, review what's going on on my social media, I would look at the replies to the tweet, which would give me a mix of replies from verified and unverified people. But then I would also look at the verified and see who that are verified public folks have responded to me, or maybe I wanna engage with\nor whatever the case may be. I don't even understand why I would look at the\nVerified feed anymore. So I never do because it's\nrandom folks who I don't know. And it sort of lost its utility to me. And then-- - Oh yeah, sorry to interrupt. But the idea is if everybody\nwho's human pays the $8, it shows to you that it's not\nbots, it's at least humans. - From the reports about\nthe number of people that have bought the blue check mark, I think we may be a thousand\nyears from enough signups in order to make that\nsort of like a reality. - That was the idea.\n- That was the idea. It's an interesting idea. Honestly from my experience, obviously I was seeing all\nsorts of attack comments, some of which were, I'm sure from bots. But I'm ignoring all of\nthose comments anyway. So it really didn't affect\nmy experience that much. I mean here's the thing\nabout Elon and I say this, people sometimes are like, David, you obviously hate Elon\nor you obviously love Elon. I was an investor in\nTesla starting in 2015. I've since sold all my shares. Great run. I'm on my second Tesla right now. I probably won't get a third one because I think that\nelectric vehicle technology is now maturing such\nthat when my lease is up, I'm gonna have many more options with the range and charging\nnetwork, that's important to me. But I could be wrong. Maybe, you know, I don't know. I have no, the cults of\npersonality around people, they mean nothing to me. So for me it's just\nlike people are people. Nobody has only good ideas. Fine. I think that what Elon Musk did accelerating and pushing forward the battery and electric vehicle\ntechnology is unbelievable. It's a one person wrecking\nball in the best sense of saying we're not gonna slow play this and do okay, now Toyota,\nhasn't actually entered, but now whoever, we've\ngot a 90 mile range car, and next year it'll be 110. And it's just like we're\ndoing this right now, you can compete or you can opt out and look at what's happened. Fantastic. On the Twitter side of things, I don't really get the whole plan. I don't know if it started\nmaybe as kind of a goof of some kind and it developed into, I guess I have to buy it. And I think something\nabout it ended up with, there was a clause invoked where I think he did try\nto get out of buying it but then was forced to to some degree. - Yeah, he was forced. - The way Twitter used to\nwork was you followed people and when you looked at your feed, you either saw the posts from\nthe people you were following in reverse chronological order, or posts from the people you followed algorithmically tailored to what you're most likely to wanna see. And if you didn't follow someone, you generally wouldn't see their posts unless it was like a sponsored tweet, or someone you follow quoted\nor retweeted them, fine. The For You feed, TikTok I believe first had\na so-called For You feed. The idea is this is stuff you might like based on, I don't know what, either demographic data about you, your other habits, whatever. And so it's useless to me. It's just basically\nmostly right wing content that is not interesting to me. - Why do you think that is? I mean, so the signals that are used to generate the For You page\nis looking at all your likes, all your comments, all your\nblocks and mutes and all that. It should-- - [David] You know that, I mean, I don't know what it's looking at, okay. - So it's supposed to be\nvery pleasant for you. - I'm sure other people go, wow, this For You thing is awesome. And I'll get like, if you had insert some\nrightwinger sitting here, they would go Twitter used to\nsuppress right wing voices, and now finally they're\ngetting the fair shake that they deserve in the For You feed. Okay, I mean. - I wonder if there's left wing folks setting their feelings of Elon aside that are enjoying the For You page. That's a really important question 'cause it's supposed to be, people on the left and people on the right should be enjoying the For You page. - Sure. Yeah, I mean, so for me, my thought on Elon is\nsome incredible successes. I don't know about Twitter. I do think that, I don't\nbelieve Elon is a right-winger, and when you see interviews with him, certainly at least socially,\nand in many ways culturally, seems very moderate or\neven somewhat on the left in my experience. So I don't think it's\nElon's a rightwinger. I don't, that it's not\nan interesting critique. It does seem though that\nthroughout the Twitter escapade, he certainly ended up\ncloser to some voices that may be influencing\nhim in a particular way that's giving some people\nthat impression, you know? But as far as like the\nElon hate or the Elon love, it's just a person who's\ndone some interesting things, some of which I like and some of which I could\nkind of leave aside. - I have seen folks be\ndrift towards the right more in response to just the\nviciousness of attacks from the left. - [David] Hmm, like who? - Well Elon and-- - So you do think he's\ndrifted towards the right. - So I don't think at the core,\nbut I think on the surface. - [David] Okay. - And I think Joe Rogan\nhas as well on the surface, 'cause I think, so maybe\nyou can correct me, but it feels like people on\nthe left attack more viciously. - That has not been my experience. - Oh it hasn't? No, so yeah, let me know because my sense was that\nthey attack people on the left viciously as well. Left attacks its own, because you're not progressive\nenough, you're not, you know, it is just this kind of bullying that happens very intensely. - No you're 100% right that\nwhen the left has attacked me, it's almost as vicious as\nwhen the right attacks me. The difference in my experience is, it's a smaller contingent on the left that's willing to levy\nthose attacks against me. But I'm on the left. So to some degree you could say, well, that's to be expected. There is toxicity on the left. - But it's intense, isn't it? Like, and that's what I mean, like the attacks on people\nwho are on the left, just you're not left enough. - Yeah, that's, no, that's the-- - [Lex] And it is a\nsmall number of people. - I can't deny that that is\nabsolutely a real phenomenon, and depending on what sort of\ntopics you take on publicly, you are going to suffer the wrath of that to a greater or lesser degree. But with all of these things,\nwhat I always go back to is, you know, I probably would\nhave more disagreements with Rogan today than the\nlast time I was on his show, which was like at the\nbeginning of the pandemic. But there would be zero, and I've done clips critical\nof things that he has said, substantive, of course. To me it's sort of like, oh yeah, I could sit down with\nhim and do a podcast, and it would be zero big deal. And I would tell him, I stand by everything I\nsaid about what you said, and I would say it to you right now. There are people who write to me and go, oh man, things must be\nreally, really tense now. If you were to, Rogan\nwould never have you on because you disagreed, and it's like-- - [Lex] He loves you. - I'm sure he's just not thinking of me. I'm not the most important\nthing to Joe Rogan. I think both of us would\nbe able to sit down and talk about every one of my criticisms. It would not be taken personally, and then we would move on\nand it would be the next day. - You get attacked a lot. How do you not let that\nbreak you mentally? - Oof, I don't know. So let's see. I try to, I mean, I'm in a toxic space. The news in politics,\npartisan news in politics, partisan news in politics on the internet with a social media component, just completely and totally toxic. From a personal perspective,\nwhen I'm done producing my last show of the week until Monday, I try to completely tune out from news and politics altogether, and also make an effort to\njust not look at feedback and what's going on. I also really limit my visibility. I don't need to read every comment. I don't need to look at\nevery email or every tweet. I have 15 minutes each day where I go through my\nsocial media platforms, look at generally what\nhas the reaction been, maybe include that in my assessment of how I want to tackle a certain issue if I missed a good point\nor something like that, and basically try to move on. When something like we talked about at the beginning happens,\nit becomes obsessive. I mean, it's unhealthy, right? Where I'm going, oh my God,\nwho's attacking me now, and scrolling? It becomes, you know, I'm\nsweating, it's horrible. But I think just like\nlimiting exposure to that, and remembering that it is\nimpossible to please everybody. And so I'd really rather have\nfresh, genuine views each day rather than views that are sort of like restricted and flattened by what I perceive to\nbe people's preferences. - So just can you speak a little more to the full process of\ncreating the David Pakman Show? Like what, you wake up because you're\ndoing five shows a week? - I have the Letterman schedule, which means I do five shows in four days. I shoot Monday to Thursday,\nbut we're doing five episodes. Basically our guests,\nwe schedule in advance. I'm picking six to eight\nstories each day that are, like I said, a blend of stuff I think\nwill be interesting, things I want to talk about,\nand things where there's, it's being discussed at one layer and I want to go deeper on it, and I feel like I'm able to do that. I choose those stories in the morning, record in the early afternoon, and we put the show out by that afternoon. - What's the preparation, what's\nthe, how do you take notes? Are you on a sheet of paper? - No sheets of paper anymore. I used to do sheets of paper. I found something about it, like at work, the tactile nature of it. It became inconvenient for\nsharing the notes with my team. But basically we use a wiki type system. It's called Media Wiki, which is basically like a Wikipedia clone. - [David] Old school. - Yeah, old school. So we can have pages for\nevery guest, every topic. - [David] Oh, that's interesting,\nI haven't heard that. - Yeah, I don't know\nanyone else who's using it. It works really well. It's so fast and it\ntakes up almost no space. So it just is a really good tool. When my team, you know, when we book a guest and they\nhave notes from the publicist, they'll put it in there,\nand then I can access it. So I'm basically working off\nof notes rather than a script. I'll pull any audio\nvisual stuff that I want so that that's available. And it's, I mean it's\nreally a very seamless, you know, we're doing this\nevery day, four days a week. And so we have it down\nto a well oiled machine. - Where do you get ideas from? - Everywhere. I have a bunch of subreddits that I follow that I think are talking\nabout interesting things. I have a curated list for\nwhich I still use Twitter, and it is very good for this. It's a curated private list of journalists that I think are doing interesting work. So I'll see what's there. Look at the sort of standard\nnews reporting wire services, AP and Reuters. Glance at what everything\nfrom Drudge, to CNN, to whoever is covering that day. Look at Google News. - How do you try to fact\ncheck stuff on your show? So like is there sources\nor is there a process? - I always try to get to a\nprimary source first and foremost for the facts of the story. And then I'll use other tools\nfor background research. Oftentimes Wikipedia's footnotes,\nI find to be useful tools. ChatGPT is a good one. You really have to fact check it, but it'll give you ideas of\nwhere to do the fact checking, which I think is fantastic. Sometimes it gives me information\nthat's flat out wrong, and when you ask for the source, it's like, oh yeah, that\nactually is not real, which is, hey, it's part of the process. But, and then when there's like\nan expertise type of thing, if it's a breaking legal matter, I'll just call like a\nfriend who's a lawyer, or call a friend who's a\ndoctor or something like that if it lends itself to that. - Let me ask you about\nthe nature of truth. Do you think it's becoming\nmore and more difficult to know what is true, and will become continuously, continue to get more\ndifficult, especially with GPT? - I think the big difficulty\nis in getting people to agree as to what is a statement of fact and what is a statement of opinion. I think once we can do that, reasonable people can more or less agree on how to get to the truth. Or if we can't get to it, at\nleast figure out how we would if the information were available. But the bigger challenge I'm having is, someone will call in with an opinion, but say they want to talk about fact, and I have to explain to them, you're talking about an\nopinion and not a fact. And this goes back to the\nlack of critical thinking and lack of media literacy. But that's the bigger\nchallenge for me right now. - But I mean, I think the big statements are always gonna be somewhat opinions. Like was the 2020 election fair? I think any answer to that is an opinion. - [David] I disagree. If we define fair. - Well, yes, so then I don't think it's possible to define fair in a way that's not several paragraphs where each sentence it\nnow has facts, right? So you what do you mean by fair? Is it who could show up to vote? What was the process of\nhow easy it is to vote? Was there actual cheating\ngoing on in different, like what is the evidence\nof that cheating? You have to actually get to the actual like details of a thing. High level, you know, everything is just going to\nbe an opinion it feels like. And you can approximate that to be, like it's a well-founded opinion. Well, most of science is an opinion, even physics is an opinion. So like, I think there's a\nthreshold beyond which an opinion becomes like, uh, this is\na pretty reliable thing to assume for now that that's just true. - Okay, so let me revise. So I think maybe better said,\nI think that the difficulty, I mean, the process you described is probably the right process, and is it's exhausting for mundane things. And that causes major problems. If we were to say, is it better for the economy to have a tax rate on people\nmaking over a million dollars, that's 20% or 50%. Okay, what do we mean by\nbetter for the economy? It's not an overwhelming\ntask to decide on that. We could say, well, we'll say\nit's better for the economy by looking at what was\nthe unemployment rate based on the tax rate on million, you know, people earning a million a year, and what was GDP and whatever. Okay, we've agreed. This is a statement, we are now in the realm of\njust determining what is given the parameters\nthat we've established. I think that that's relatively doable. The issue is with the bigger ones, like you're talking about, where what do we mean by a fair election, and fair in whose eyes? And I am with you that it often\ndevolves into a conversation about opinions about what is fair, rather than an ascertainment of the facts. - Yeah, and it feels like maybe\navoiding some of these big, maybe there's some trigger words too, maybe avoiding them allows you to actually talk about the facts, and through that, educate\nyourself and learn about, like whether the virus\nleaked from a lab or not. To me, it was always a\nsuper interesting question. I don't know why everybody\ngot super touchy about it. Mostly people I know,\ncolleagues, biologists thought it's pretty good likelihood that it leaked from a\nlab given everything. They just didn't, the evidence is not there for either one. And so like you should be able\nto just openly talk about it unless you're in a high political office where there could be\ngeopolitical consequences to your statements. But in general, it's an\ninteresting question. You should be able to talk\nabout it, but there's no, first of all, there's not many facts\naround there, unfortunately. And a lot of very\nconclusive statements about, especially in the early\ndays, were just opinions. And so you have to, the\nidea of what is true or not becomes a little, even mentioning the word\ntruth in that context, it feels divisive. - Yeah, I completely agree\nwith you, which is strange. Like it really, you think it shouldn't. One of the really good opening\nquestions that I've had work to my advantage\nwhen talking with people who I know disagree with me\nabout a contentious topic, is how do you think we would figure out X? And it often gets people\nthinking first collaboratively, and obviously we might have\nvery different opinions, but with something like\nthe COVID lab leak, I think it's an interesting\none because if you say, okay, maybe it leaked, maybe it didn't, how would we figure that out? Who would we trust to weigh in on that? What evidence would count? Now we're kind of on the same team, and then if we can establish that, then we're on a search for capital T truth together or whatever. It's kind of pie in the sky,\nbut in some conversations, I've actually had success with that. - And then you can kind of realize, if there's no amount of\nevidence that's gonna prove, show to you that you're wrong\nin your current opinion, that that's probably a\nreally bad sign for you. - It may be a waste to pursue\nthe conversation further at that point. Yeah, I mean, yeah, what, oh, so okay, you think Trump was a good President. How do you determine that\nand what evidence might exist that would change your mind? There is no evidence. Trump was the best President ever. I think the conversation's probably done. - [Lex] Except Abraham Lincoln. - Right. - You mentioned Israel Palestine. Well, what do you think\nabout the situation in Israel and Palestine, and something you've thought\nabout or spoken about for quite a time. Do you think we'll ever see\npeace in this part of the world? - I don't know. You know, I mean, I could say yes. - [David] It's a synonymous answer. - I could say yes. You know, one of the problems is, and I'll give, you may not know that there are people on\nthe left of my audience who call me a Netanyahu Shill, even though I've never been\na supporter of Netanyahu, and I'm on the left. I just don't think that some of the, kind of black and white\ncharacterizations about Israel are even remotely accurate. And I think most people, it's\nbecome a sort of litmus test. Are you criticizing Israel enough? Are you showing us that\nyou're actually left wing? I don't do any of that stuff. I really look at the\nsituation for what it is. - That's become a litmus\ntest in American politics, in the spectrum of American politics. - Yes. My view big picture, is that I don't think we're\ngoing to really get anywhere until some pre-negotiated terms are set, and the parties to do the negotiating are all good faith parties. For example, I don't think\nIsrael's right wing party, Likud, is a particularly good\nfaith arbiter of peace, because I think Likud benefits\nfrom there not being peace, and the threat of violence. And there is violence, it's not\njust the threat of violence. I don't think Hamas is going\nto be an arbiter of peace for the Palestinian people either. I think the Palestinian\nauthority is a question mark, I'm not sure. So I think that there need\nto be some preconditions that would need to be set with regard to everything\nfrom settlements, to, you know, a lot of this minutia. Big picture though, if I imagine what the most\nlikely solution looks like, it doesn't mean it's a perfect solution. And obviously it's a solution, many people will say\nit's not going to happen. I think it's a solution\nwhere the borders are similar to what was being discussed\nin the Clinton era to some degree, as many of the settlements\nas possible have to go, understanding that some of the bigger ones are just not going to go and there's gonna have to\nbe meaningful land swaps which Yasser Arafat\nseemed to be amenable to when he weighed in on it, I\nbelieve it was in the '90s. The topic of the Temple Mount, and Jerusalem, et cetera\nis a complicated one. But I think that almost certainly, East Jerusalem is going to have to be part of an eventual Palestinian state. You know, I mean like we can go as kind of as far as we want\nto with a lot of this stuff. - What role does us have to play in this, coming to the table\nwith good faith parties? - I don't know whether the, I go back and forth between believing that the US should play a big role, to the US should play\nessentially no role whatsoever, because of course of the funding of Israel that the US provides. It's not that I have a personal problem with American involvement, and somebody like Bill\nClinton was arguably relatively well positioned to\ntry to make something happen. It's more just will there, will it be seen as credible\non the global stage? And that's, I think, the\nmost important thing, because at the end of whatever\nnegotiation takes place, both sides need to agree that this is where we are\nrenouncing all past claims. And in the future, if\nthere's a disagreement, we can't go back to that thing\nfrom the '80s or the '90s. That's just like a critical piece of this. - Yeah, it has to be stable, and you know, materialize into\nsomething stable over years. - Yes. - Another difficult conflict\ngoing on in the world is the war in Ukraine. What do you think about the\nRussian invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022? - I don't pretend to be\nan expert on this issue. I think you probably know\nmore about this than I do, just from the brief conversation we had before we started filming. My view as a general\nobserver of geopolitics and the way that this area, this part of the world has\nrelated to American presidents over the last several, you know, cycles, is I don't think it's controversial to say that this was a war of aggression, an invasion of aggression, an act of aggression by Vladimir Putin. I do believe that if\nTrump had been reelected, Putin may have seen himself as having other tools with which\nto try to expand influence, that may have been different\nthan geographical pursuits, geographic pursuits. But we don't know that for sure. I also have a really hard time imagining what the end of this looks like. And that's very scary, because\nsometimes the most benign end seems to be that Putin\nends up out of power, either through no longer being\nalive or deposed in some way. It doesn't feel like that\nlatter is super likely, the former, there's\nreports about his health, I don't know how accurate they are. It's just hard to imagine\na face-saving exit that is going to be even\nremotely, what's the word? It's not even a question of acceptable, just, it's not satisfying either. Just not tragic, I guess\nis what I'm looking for. - In terms of Putin speaking\nto the Russian people and being able to figure out what to say, what kind of narrative to\nsay why this war made sense. - [David] Yes. - And the same on the Ukrainian side, to figure out how to exit this war. - Yes. I mean, to some degree it\nrequires Russian troops leaving Ukraine, and that is\nsomewhat under the control. I mean, of course it's not up to Ukraine whether the initiative continues, but what I am not thrilled\nwith are some of the reflexive, you know, if Trump had been\nin power instead of Joe Biden, a lot of the reflexive comments about, oh, if you say Ukraine is\njust acting defensively, you're supporting neo-Nazis, or some of these things that have come out of the\nAmerican Republican Party seem both wacky, and like they would be saying\ncompletely different things if Trump happened to\nbe in the Oval Office. They're really proxy attacks on Joe Biden. - Yeah. Well that in some sense, Ukraine is also kind of\npolitical litmus tests of how you speak about it. I think, because of the\nhuge amount of funding that's going from US to Ukraine, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that this topic has become politicized already. - 100%. There are people like Marjorie\nTaylor Greene and others saying, we should be\ndoing nothing for Ukraine. Zelenskyy is a comedian, and\nwe're supporting neo-Nazis. That's it, full stop. And you either subscribe\nto that or you don't. And it very quickly becomes, it very quickly becomes as\npartisan as so many other issues. And it's really, the\nmost disappointing thing is that some of these issues\nbecome incredibly divisive but they're simple. Like for example, a conspiracy theory\nthat we know isn't true. It shouldn't be divisive\nbecause it's so simple. Other issues become divisive,\nand they are simplified, but in reality they're\nextraordinarily complex, and you lose the ability to\ntalk about the complexity because they're becoming partisan. - Do you think there will\nalways be war in the world. There's a bunch of folks on the subreddit that were interested in your\ndifferent complex perspectives on foreign policy. So let's talk about war. You look at the war in Ukraine, you look at what's going\non in Israel and Palestine, you look at the wars across the world. Do you think there will always be war? As a redditor put it, is it a necessary evil in\nthe game of geopolitics? - I used to have what I now believe is an extremely naive perspective, which is that if we somehow, if intelligent aliens arrived here, it would be so momentous for homosapiens, that all of our differences\nwould immediately be exposed to so insignificant. We would never fight again, and we would realize\nthat intelligent life. And then I spoke to people\nwho deal in space exploration and other scientists, and they all said, David, that's extraordinarily naive. There would be a period during which this was as momentous\nas you're imagining, and then it would become normal. And then we would go back to\nmany of the same conflicts that we have now, sectarian, et cetera. I think that in all likelihood, there will always be\nconflict between factions, whether it's what we\ncurrently think of as war, probably not. I mean, it seems as though\nthe tactics will evolve, and it will be less about missiles, and I don't know where it's going to go. I don't know whether it's going\nto become more biological, or cyber, or certainly something we haven't even considered yet. But I think there will always be conflicts we would refer to in that way. - Do you agree with Chomsky on the, his general harsh criticism\nof US foreign policy in war, that many actions, military\nactions in the United States are criminal in nature,\nalmost terrorist in nature? - I am not, it's been a decade or more since I've read any Chomsky, and I don't keep up with everything that he has recently said. So I don't want to\nmischaracterize any of it. - In general, Americans are sold the view that we're the good guys spreading\nfreedom across the world. And I know Chomsky takes\na perspective that, yeah, but if you look at the\nnumber of civilians you kill while doing it, it's incomparable to any\nother military actions across the world. - Right, so I very much\ndisagree with those who take the view that the US is this wonderful global police force that's spreading democracy\nand fixing problems. Very, very much wrong. I think where I've had disagreements with Chomsky in the past is more, he seems to frame the US\nas a uniquely bad actor in some of these cases. And I think it's more an outcropping of the size and wealth of the US, and less about uniquely\nnegative intentions. And so I think that would\nbe my general disagreement with Chomsky based on\nstuff I read a decade ago. - Well, he says that he\nlives in the United States, he's an American. And so he feels his focus of\ncriticism should be on America. And I think that's one of the great things about being an American\nand being in America is the freedom to criticize harshly. - [David] Sure. - While being a university\nprofessor, by the way. He's basically the embodiment of why tenure is a really valuable thing. - [David] I agree. - Whether you agree with him or not. Question from Reddit. Ask David what he plans\nfor his garden this year. Is this a joke or is this-- - It's not a joke. I got into gardening a few years ago. Honestly, I'm with the baby. I can't do a garden this year. And I have a lot of travel coming up, so everything would die. But I did start to try\nto figure out gardening. If you're stressed by the toxicity of the social media world, gardening is a great hobby. It really is. But it is extraordinarily time consuming. So I have no garden planned this year. - Are there books or\nmaybe movies in your life that had a big impact on you, that, you know, you're\nthinking about that diet, has there been stuff you read,\nforget about even just books, like blogs or writers, or\njust sources of information that had, that molded you\ninto the intellectual, into the political thinker that you are? - It's so hard to, this\nis sort of like, you know, you win an Oscar, and you wanna make sure you\nthank all the right people. I read so much and have\nbeen reading for so long that it's really hard to say. But I think certainly for me, narrative nonfiction has\nbeen a fantastic genre to learn not only about history, but also about people and psychology. And very often when people\nsay, I don't really read, like, what can you recommend to me that might be interesting. Depending on, you know,\nknowing them to some degree, I'll give recommendations there. In terms of just things\nI picked up recently that I think are interesting, I've been reading a bunch of Neil Postman, I read a Jenny Odell\nhas a new book on time and the concept of like saving time, spending time, et cetera. She just published it. Super interesting. I just read Lansing's book\nabout the Shackleton voyage in Antarctica in 1914, '15, and '16. Super interesting. I'm really all over the map. - [Lex] I have that one on audiobook I've been meaning to listen to. - It's very interesting\nand it seems inconceivable how these guys survived,\ncompletely inconceivable, and yet they did. - It kind of inspires you to\nthink of space exploration, and taken on similar kinds of\nrisky and dangerous journeys. In narrative nonfiction, I\nagree with you very much. I've been reading a lot\nof 20th century history about Stalin and about Hitler. Rise and Fall of the Third\nReich I've read twice now, and I recommend. - [David] What did you\nget out of reading it the second time? - So what I, so the second time\nI listened to the audiobook as I ran. I get the same thing from it, as I get maybe reading\nMan's Search for Meaning, which is all the troubles of\nday-to-day in the modern world kind of fade away and dissipate\nwhen I'm thinking about the, you know, basically the\nembodiment of evil at scale at that recent time in human history. So it makes me sort of appreciate all the, it fills me with gratitude\nto have all the freedoms, all the just simple joys\nof life that we have today. And I think the second\ntime as I was reading it, because William Shire was\nthere, he's the author, he was there through the whole thing. You start to pick up little details as opposed to like big things. You start to pick up the little\nquirks of how history turns, and just like these little events. You notice of the dynamics\nbetween people in a room during a meeting with Hitler. You just notice these little\nthings that are mentioned, 'cause like he was either there directly or hurted the next day. So you get, that's why to me, Rise and Fall of the\nThird Reich is interesting is 'cause it's by a guy who was there, who's reporting on it, versus a sort of a more\ndistant displaced retaliant. And I also like biographies. I'm a big fan of biographies. And Walter Isaacson has just\nwritten some incredible ones, and Steve Jobs, and Einstein,\nall that kind of stuff. - Viktor Frankl's book is one\nI've read a bunch of times. And it's so short. And you know, reading in general, I know a lot of people who\nread way more than I do, and I also know a lot of\npeople who don't read at all. I mean, they haven't read a\nbook since college essentially. To me, it's almost like\nthe amount I get from it, it's almost like a secret weapon, where when I think, you know,\nin two or three or 400 pages, which I can read in, whatever 10 days, or however long it takes,\nreading 30 pages a day, the amount of information, insights into so many\naspects of the human psyche that I can get. It's sort of like, it's not\nlike I'm in a competition for anything in particular with\nanybody, I just do my show. But it's sort of like, if I'm reading dozens of books a year and you're reading zero, I'm exposed to so many\ndifferent things and ideas that are not even in your universe. It just seems like, the power of reading\njust seems overwhelming. - And I had, speaking of getting attacked, I had a fun time getting\nattacked a few months ago for publishing a reading list. So I'm reading at least a book a week, read 18 or 19 books from\nthe beginning of the year. - [David] You got attacked\nfor the books you chose, or for this-- - I don't know for what. But it would get, became quite viral. - [David] Attacked for reading? That's something. - So it's basically what\nhappened is that people, I actually don't, it's not\nworth folks who know know, folks who don't, don't\neven worry about it. It's the, what I really loved\nabout being attacked for it is it shows you can get\nattacked for anything. - [David] Apparently. - So it's not like I did something wrong, it was kind of a beautiful thing, and it was just the most\nintensely beautiful display of absurdity of Twitter and the internet, that there were articles written about me with the book list. There's no bad books on it. The thing I was being mocked\nfor is reading Dostoevsky, reading stuff that sounds like\na high school reading list. - [David] Oh I see. - Or all these kinds of\naspects of the reading list, which doesn't stand up to any sort of legitimate\nkind of criticism. But the fact that people are\njust looking for single words or single aspects of a tweet\nand so on to criticize is, it actually forced me to,\n'cause I released a video about, you know, summarizing my\ntakeaways from one of the books, and I've been meaning to do more and more. But every time I start\nto like, wanna record it, I have this negative feeling. They kind of ruin the fun\nof sharing with others. - I know exactly what\nyou're talking about. My advice on that is don't do it. Just don't record it. Because, and is that what you basically. - Yeah, for now, but\nI think time cures it. But for now I decide not to. - [David] Yes. - It's just, until I\nfeel joy when I do it. - We are in such a privileged position to even be able to do\nthis sort of thing, right? I have taken on projects, and then it sort of sounds good, or I end up doing it because\nthere's some third party that brings the idea, and I feel like I can't\nreally say no or whatever. And then when I get in\nfront of the camera, or I have to write something, for a while, I did a newspaper\ncolumn that I hated doing. I realized that I'm\nruining the exact thing that I have worked to build, which is that I can\njust do whatever I want. Why am I doing this? And sometimes it takes\nme a week to realize it, sometimes it takes me a year. But just don't do it, that's the path. - In this case in\nparticular, it's also the, there's a private thing I\nenjoy, which is reading. - [David] Right. - And if sharing that private\nthing you enjoy is not fun, then just don't share it. That's, yeah. There's certain things, there's certain private things\nthat should remain private. That's like, which is one\nof the first things ever. I'm the same person\nprivately as I am publicly. But the books, it's like,\nman, I don't get to share, I guess through these conversations I can, I share some of the stuff\nI'm reading and enjoying it, 'cause it sucks. It sucks to get attacked for stuff, and it sucks to get\nattacked for stuff you love. - Yeah, especially reading. I mean it's, you know, that's\nthe bottom of the barrel. I have these ideas where I'll go, you know, maybe for my next thing, I'll go from politics, which is so toxic, I'll go to travel blogging, 'cause there's so many\ntravel bloggers I follow, and there's so many interesting places. And then I go, wait a second, I like traveling and just hanging out. Now traveling is gonna be my job, and now I've gotta bring\ntwo cameras with me, and I've gotta get shots\nand I've gotta film my food. And I'm not gonna do that. I'm just gonna do what I'm doing, but then I'll travel when\nI want to take a vacation. - And of course some of it could be fun. I mean, I have to say,\nwhen I did the one video on a book, 1984, I really enjoyed it. That whole process, it was fun. It was, I don't think I've ever\nthought as hard about a book when I had to make a video about it. 'Cause I had to like,\nyou know, I read 1984, I don't know how many times. Probably five, 10 times, I don't remember. I read Animal Farm way more. But I don't think I was like,\nwhat do I think about like, what are the key takeaways for me? I didn't really know. Like if you asked me what I\nthink about even Animal Farm, 'cause I haven't done that one, and I've read that one, I\ndon't know, over 50 times. It's probably my favorite book. Is like, I would have to struggle. And making a video about it, basically a little mini lecture, forced me to actually have an opinion about the details of it, and to do enough research to think like, okay, what is the historical\ncontext of this book? I mean, it allowed me to say interesting, and to think interesting\nstuff about the book. I found it to be really rewarding to basically the old Feynman thing, one of the best ways to\nlearn is to teach, right? - Yeah, I can't think of one thing I would say about Animal Farm, and I read it again not that long ago, but I don't know what comments are. - You kind of have a generic comment, about like authoritarianism\nand so on, whatever. But there could be interesting\nquirks of the book, and the characters and\nhow corruption happens. You could say all kinds of stuff that it may be contrasting it. Like even with 1984, it allowed me to contrast\nwith Brave New World, and how that 1984 was politicized, and how it's used by the\nRepublican Party after day. Like you could say a\nlot of interesting stuff if you like, think about it, and write it down on a sheet of paper, maybe you don't need to\nmake a video about it. So I found it to be really\nrewarding in general. So I probably will do more\nof it, but not always. Not as a main profession, just like with the travel blogging. - I agree with that. - I mean, you get threatened a lot, you get attacked a lot online. Do you think about your mortality? - Well, the other day\nI went to the doctor, and he said, you know, next physical, we're gonna be talking\nabout a lot of new things. And so I was thinking\nabout it a lot that day. No, I mean it's funny, I like, I recently did\na bunch of estate stuff. - [Lex] Yeah. - And when you have intellectual property, there's a question of like,\nokay, I have my assets. But also if I died tomorrow, especially in a particularly fiery death, my YouTube channel would\nprobably for a while generate more money, because it would be like, oh my goodness, this person died in a terrible. What happens with a future revenue stream and all these different things? And it got me thinking about legacy, and about the fact that people\nwho do this sort of thing, it's kind of a new thing in a sense. And so, you know, if you work at ABC News, at some point you just retire and someone else fills in for you. How does my career wind down given like I don't actually know the answer. I'm not sure. What is it, I just one\nday stop posting videos, but all my content stays up\ngetting fewer and fewer views. Or do I delete everything? Do I, I don't know. What is-- - If you die, I mean,\nso my trip to Ukraine, 'cause I knew I was going to the front, is the first time I did,\nI record a video if I die. And I posted it and I give\ninstructions to folks what to do. And so like there's a closure. - [David] Yeah. - But it's an interesting process. Like what happens to your, at which point does GPT take over and continue tweeting for\nDavid Pakman, you know? - Well, the tweeting I\ncare less about right now, unless Blue becomes\nsomething unbelievable, I'm less worried about Twitter. But some of my audience members\nhave been saying, you know, some of these tools, David,\nare getting good enough, that we could clone your voice\nand also make it match video. And with scripts, you could\njust keep pumping out content even if you were gone. And I said, now that I'm interested in, that I wanna learn more about. - Boy, it's gonna be a weird future. What advice do you have to young folks that are facing this future? - Almost always, it's some\nversion of start right away. And that applies in so\nmany different ways. So if you're thinking about, oftentimes the context is\npeople want to do what I do. And I always say, do not\nsit around for a year thinking about lighting. This is how you never do anything. And dozens of people\nwho I've felt obligated to talk to on the phone because\nof a personal connection, I go through all the advice, and I can tell they're not gonna do it. They just, it's already\nsounding too complicated. And so instead they'll sort of say, well, I gotta get the right\nlighting in the right room and blah, blah, blah, blah. The best thing you can do,\nno matter what you're doing, is just start right away. And that applies in this business and in whatever else you're doing. If you wanna learn a new\nthing, find a new hobby. The ability to get data right away about what's working, what's not working, and whether you even like this\napproach that you're taking is so valuable. And it will allow you to iterate. And the sooner you do it, the cost to a change of\ndirection will also be lower. If there's any, I don't do like self-help or generic advice type stuff, but the one thing that applies\nin so many situations is, just try it right away\nand iterate from there. - Yeah, start today and\nthen do it every day. - Or decide, hey, you know what? I figured out I don't\nactually wanna do it. - Yeah, hence iterate. Well usually you'll discover you do. You think we'll make\nit out of the century, humanity, human civilization? - Out of the, so like to 2100? - Yeah, how much we got? 80 years. - Yeah, 77. I think we're gonna make it. - You think so? - [David] Yeah. - What are the biggest threats\nfacing our civilization, if not wokeism? - If it's not wokeism, it's hard to say. No. I actually think that if you believe that we are on an\ninflection point of sorts in changes to society and\nacceleration of technology, et cetera, I think it's really tough to know in 2090 what will actually be the biggest threat. So, I don't know, it's\nso cliche to say nuclear, and climate change, and another pandemic. - Technologically our world\nmight look so different than it's almost-- - [David] Yes, yes. - Unimaginable. What it means to be human is unimaginable. And also the degree that we\nmake progress out into space is also unimaginable. - I think space is super interesting, and there's people on\nboth the left and right who for different reasons are kind of not into the\nwhole space exploration thing. The people I hear from, the ones on the right think\nit's just kind of dumb. The ones on the left think it's an excuse not to fix problems here. I think-- - And also they say it's the\nplay thing of billionaires. - [David] Sure. - Which is another funny kind of concept. - Yeah, I mean, someone's\ngotta pay for it. Why not be people who have\na lot of money to blow. - It could either be billionaires or governments that are trillionaires. - [David] Sure. - Somebody has to pay for big\nambitious moonshot projects. - To me, the most interesting thing is that in getting closer to the next step of space exploration, we may well learn things that can then be used to\nimprove circumstances here. For me, it's not one or the other. And I recently read a long\npiece about why not Mars? Because it's terrible in\nevery way for supporting life. Okay, so like that's one perspective, but still in so exploring, who knows what we might end up learning. So I'm big on it. I don't share the view of\nsome on the left about it. - So I guess to add to your\nadvice to young people, if a thing seems terrible, you still might wanna consider doing it? - I would say so, yeah. How many things have seen, I mean, listen, there are so\nmany trips where the day before I say, why am I doing this? The jet lag, I've gotta do this and that. And now who, if my guest\nhost falls through. I should just stay in work. And I go, hold on. You do this every time. Just go, you never regret it. You learn something, you try something. I never regret the trip. - This hopefully applies to\nthe conversation we had today. David, I'm a big fan of yours. Thank you so much for talking today. Thank you for being patient with me. We tried to talk earlier. Please continue doing what you're doing. Please continue being objective\nand thoughtful and fearless. - Thank you.\n- On the internet. - Big fan of yours as\nwell, I appreciate it. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Pakman.

What difference does it make\nto the dead, the orphans, and the homeless? Whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism, or in the holy name of\nliberty or democracy. Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
