      "text": "- Listen, when it comes\nto romantic relationships, if it's not a hundred percent in you, it ain't happening. And I've never seen a violation of that statement where it's like, yeah, it's\nmostly good and they're this, and this is like the negotiations. Well, already you're, it's doomed. And that doesn't mean\nsomeone has to be perfect, the relationship has to be perfect. But it's gotta feel a\nhundred percent inside. Like, yes, yes, and yes. - The following is a\nconversation with my dear friend, Andrew Huberman, his fourth\ntime on this podcast. It's my birthday. So this is a special\nbirthday episode of sorts. Andrew flew down to Austin just\nto wish me a happy birthday, and we decided to do\na podcast last second. We literally talked for hours beforehand and a long time after,\nlate into the night. He's one of my favorite human\nbeings, brilliant scientist, incredible teacher, and a loyal friend. I'm grateful for Andrew. I'm grateful for good friends, for all the support and love I've gotten over the past few years. I'm truly grateful for this life. For the years, the days, the minutes, the seconds I've gotten to live on this beautiful earth of ours. I really don't want to leave just yet. I think I'd really like to stick around. I love you all. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" And now, dear friends,\nhere's Andrew Huberman."

      "text": "- I'm trying to run a little bit more. - Are you losing weight? - I'm not trying to lose weight, but I always do the same fitness routine after like 30 years, basically, lift three days a week,\nrun three days a week. But one of the runs is a long\nrun, one of 'em is medium, one of 'em is a sprint-type thing. So what I've decided to do\nthis year was just extend the duration for the long run. And I like being a mobile. I never wanna be so\nheavy that I can't move. Like I wanna be able to go out and run 10 miles if I have to. So sometimes I do. And I wanna be able to\nsprint if I have to. So sometimes I do. And lifting an objects, feels good. It feels good to train like a lazy bear and just lift heavy objects. But I've also started\ntraining with lighter weights and higher repetitions, and for three month cycles, and it gives your joints a rest. And yeah, so probably, you know, I think it also is interesting to see how training differently\nchanges your cognition. That's probably hormone-related, you know, that hormones\ndownstream of training heavy versus hormones downstream of\ntraining a little bit lighter. I think my cognition is better\nwhen I'm doing more cardio and when the repetition ranges\nare a little bit higher, which is not to say that\npeople who lift heavy are dumb, but there is a... 'cause there's real\nvalue in lifting heavy. - There's a lot of angry\npeople listening to this right now.\n- No, no, no. But lifting heavy and then\ntaking 3 to 5 minutes rest is far and away a different challenge than running hard for 90 minutes. That's a tough thing. Just like getting in an\nice bath, people say, \"Oh, well, how is that any\ndifferent than working out?\" Well, there are a lot of differences, but one of 'em is that\nit's very acute stress, within one second you're stressed. So I think subjecting the body to a bunch of different types of\nstressors in space and time is really valuable. So yeah, I've been\nplaying with the variables in a pre-systematic way. - Well, I like long and slow for, like you said, the\nimpact it has on my cognition. - Yeah, the wordlessness of it, the way it puts you in a, the way it seems to clean out the clutter. You know, it can take away that hyperfocus and put you more in a\nrelaxed focus, for sure. - Well, for me, it brings the clutter to the surface at first. Like, all these thoughts come in there and then they dissipate. You know, I've been, because I got knee barred pretty hard, that's when somebody\ntries to break your knee, you know?\n- That's Jiu-jitsu. They try and break your knee? Oh, so you tap, so they... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's, you know, hyperextend the knee at that direction, they got\nknee barred pretty hard. So in ways I don't understand,\nit kinda hurts to run. I don't understand what's\nhappening behind there. I need to investigate this. It basically, this, the hamstringing flex, like curling your leg hurts a little bit. And that results in this weird, dull, but sometimes extremely sharp\npain in the back of the knee. So I'm working through this, anyway, but walking doesn't hurt. So I've been playing around\nwith walking recently, like for two hours and thinking- - I love that.\n- because I know a lot of like smart\npeople throughout history. I have walked and thought,\nand you have to like, you know, play with things\nthat have worked for others. Not just to exercise, but to like integrate this very light kind of prolonged exercise\ninto a productive life. So they do all their\nthinking while they walk. It's like a meditative type of walking. And it's really interesting. It really works. - Yeah, the practice I've been\ndoing a lot more of lately is I walk while reading a book, in the yard, I'll just pace back and forth or walk in a circle. - [Lex] Audiobook or are you talking about-\n- No, hard copy. - [Lex] Well, you're just holding- - I'm holding the book and\nI'm walking and I'm reading. And I usually have a\npen and I'm underlining, I have this whole system, like underlining stars,\nexclamation points, goes back to university of\nwhat things I'll go back to, which things I export to\nnotes and that kind of thing. But from the beginning when\nI opened my lab at that time in San Diego before I\nmoved back to Stanford, I would have meetings with\nmy students or postdocs by just walking in the\nfield behind the lab, you know, and I'd bring\nmy Bulldog, Costello. Bulldog Masttif at the time. And he was a slow walker. So these were slow walks, but I can think much\nmore clearly that way. There's a Nobel Prize winning professor at Columbia University School\nof Medicine, Richard Axel, who won the Nobel Prize, co-won\nNobel Prize with Linda Buck for the discovery of the\nmolecular basis of olfaction. And he walks and voice\ndictates his papers. And now with Rev or these other, maybe there are better ones than Rev, where you can convert audio\nfiles into text very quickly and then edit from there. So I will often voice dictate first drafts and things like that. And I totally agree on the long runs, the walks, the integrating\nthat with cognitive work, harder to do with sprints. And then the gym, you know, are you, you weight train? - Yeah.\n- You just seem naturally strong and like thicker jointed. - (chuckles)\n- It's true, it's true. I mean, we did the one very beginner. 'cause I'm a very beginner\nof jiu-jitsu class together. And yeah, as I mentioned then,\nwhat if people missed it? Lex is freakishly strong. - I think I was born\ngenetically to hug people. - [Andrew] Oh, like Costello. - Yeah, exactly.\n- You guys have a certain similarity. He had wrists, like, you know, it's like you and Jocko and\nCostello have these like wrists and elbows that are super thick, you know, and then when you look around,\nyou see tremendous variation. You know, some people have like\nthe wrist width of a Whippet or Woody Allen, and then\nother people like you or Jocko or, you know? There's this one Jocko video\nor thing on GQ or something. Have you seen the comments on Jocko? These are the best. - [Lex] No. (chuckles) - The comments, I love\nthe comments on YouTube 'cause occasionally they're funny. The best is when Jocko was born, the doctor looked at his\nparents and said, it's a man. (Lex laughs) - [Lex] It's like Chuck\nNorris type comments. - Oh yeah, those are great. That's what I miss about\nRogan being on YouTube with the full length\nepisode, oh, that comment."

      "section": "Advice to younger self",
      "text": "- So this is technically\na birthday podcast. What do you love most about getting older? - It's like, the confirmation that comes from getting more and more data that which basically says, yeah, the first time\nyou thought that thing, it was actually right because the second, third\nand fourth and fifth time, it turned out the exact same way. In other words, there have\nbeen a few times in my life where I did not feel easy\nabout something I felt a signal from my body, this is not good. And I didn't trust it early on, but I knew it was there. And then two or three\nbad experiences later, I'm able to say, ah, every single time there was a signal from the body informing my mind, \"this is not good.\" Now the reverse has also been true that there've been a number of instances in which I feel there\nsort of immediate delight. And there's this kind\nof almost astonishingly simple experience of feeling\ncomfortable with somebody or at peace with something,\nor delighted at an experience. And it turns out all, literally all of those\nexperiences and people turned out to be experiences and people that are still in my life and that I still delight in every day. In other words, what's\ngreat about getting older is that you stop questioning the signals that come from the, I think, deeper recesses of\nyour nervous system to say, Hey, this is not good, or hey,\nthis is great, more of this. Whereas, I think in my\nteens, my 20s, my 30s, I'm 40, almost 48, I'll be 48 next month. I didn't trust, I didn't listen. I actually put a lot of work\ninto overriding those signals and learning to fight through them, thinking that somehow\nthat was making me tougher or somehow that was making me smarter. When in fact, in the end, those people that you meet that are, you know, difficult or you know, there are other names for\nit, you know, it's like, in the end you're like, that\nperson's a piece of, you know? Or this person is amazing\nand they're really wonderful. And I felt that from go. - So you've learned to trust your gut versus like the influences\nof other people's opinions. - I've learned to trust my gut versus the forebrain over analysis,\noverriding the gut. Other people often in my life\nhave had great optics, right? I've benefited tremendously\nfrom an early age of being in a large community. Well, it's been mostly guys, but I have some close female\nfriends and always have as well who will tell me that\nthat's a bad decision or this person not so good, or be careful, or they're great, or that's great. So oftentimes my community\nand the people around me have been more aligned\nwith the correct choice than not-\n- Christian, really? - Yes\n- Really? When you were younger, like, or like friends, parents and so on? - I don't recall ever really\nlistening to my parents that much, you know, I\ngrew up in a, you know, we don't have to go back\nto my childhood thing, but my sense was that-\n- It's your fault, Andrew. - Thank you, I learned that recently in a psilocybin journey. My first high dose psilocybin journey, which was-\n- Welcome back. - done with a clinician,\nthank you very much. Thank you. I was worried there for\na second at one point, I might not coming back, but in any event, yeah, I\ngrew up with some wild kids. You know, I would say\nabout a third of my friends from childhood are dead or in jail, about a third have gone on to do tremendously impressive things. Start companies, excellent athletes, academics, scientists and clinicians. And then about a third\nare living their lives as kind of more typical. I just mean, that they are\nhappy family people with jobs that they mainly serve the\nfunction to make money. They're not sort of\ncareer into their career for career's sake. But, so some of my friends\nearly on gave me some bad ideas, but most of the time,\nmy bad ideas came from overriding the signals\nthat I knew that my body, and I would say my body and\nbrain were telling me to obey. And now I say body and brain is that there's this brain region, the insula, which does many things, but it represents our\nsense of internal sensation and interoception. And I was talking to\nPaul Conti about this, you know, who as you know,\nI respect tremendously. I think he's one of the\nsmartest people I've ever met, I think for different reasons. He and Marc Andreessen\nare some of the like, smartest people I've ever met. But Paul's level of insight\ninto the human psyche is absolutely astounding. And he says the opposite\nof what most people say about the brain, which is most people say, oh, the supercomputer of\nthe brain is the forebrain. It's like a monkey brain with a extra real estate put on there, and the forebrain is what makes us human and gives us our superpowers. Paul has said, and he's done a whole\nseries on mental health that's coming out from\nour podcast in September. So this is not an attempt to plug that, but he'll elaborate on- - Wait, Paul-\n- what I'm about to say. - [Lex] Wait, you're\ndoing a thing with Paul with the series?\n- We already did. Yeah, so Paul-\n- Oh, nice. - Yeah, so Paul Conti shot, we did, he and I sat down and he\ndid a four episode series on mental health. This is not mental illness, mental health about how to explore\none's own subconscious, explore the self build and\ncultivate the generative drive. You'll learn more about\nwhat that is from him. He's far more eloquent\nand clearer than I am. And he provides essentially a set of steps to explore the self that does not require that\nyou work with a therapist. This is self-exploration\nthat is rooted in psychiatry, it's rooted in neuroscience. And I don't think this\ninformation exists anywhere else. I'm not aware that it\nexists anywhere else. And he essentially distills it all down to one 8 1/2 by 11 sheet,\nwhich we provide for people. And he says there, I don't want to give too much away because I would detract from\nwhat he does so beautifully, but if I tried and I wouldn't\nhave accomplish it anyway. But he said, \"And I believe\nthat the subconscious is the supercomputer of the brain. All the stuff working underneath\nour conscious awareness that's driving our feelings and what we think are the decisions that we've thought through so carefully. And that only by\nexploring the subconscious and understanding it a little bit, can we actually improve\nourselves over time.\" And I agree. I think that, so that the mistake is to think that thinking\ncan override it all. It's a certain style of\nintrospection in thinking that allows us to read\nthe signals from our body, read the signals from our brain, integrate the knowledge that we're\ncollecting about ourselves and to use all that in ways\nthat are really adaptive, and generative for us."

      "section": "Jungian shadow",
      "text": "- What do you think is\nthere in that subconscious, what do you think of the\nJungian shadow, what's there? - You know, there's this idea,\nas you're familiar with too, I'm sure that this\nJungian idea that there, we all have all things inside of us. That all of us have the\ncapacity to be evil, to be good, et cetera, but that some people\nexpress one or the other to a greater extent. But he also mentioned that\nthere's a unique category of people, maybe 2 to 5% of people that don't just have all\nthings inside of them, but they actually spend\na lot of time exploring a lot of those things. The darker recesses, the\nshadows, their own shadows. You know, I'm somebody who's drawn to goodness and to light, and to joy, and all those things like anybody else. But yeah, I think maybe it\nwas part of how I grew up. Maybe it was the crowd\nI was with, maybe... But then again, you know, even when I started spending\nmore time with academics and scientists, I mean, you see shadows in other ways, right? You see pure ambition with no passion. I recall a colleague in San Diego who, it was very clear to me, did not actually care about\nunderstanding the brain, but understanding the\nbrain was just his avenue to exercise ambition. And if you gave him\nsomething else to work on, he'd work on that, in fact, he did. He left and he worked on something else. I realized he has no passion for understanding the brain, like all, I assumed all scientists do,\ncertainly why I went into it. But some people, it's just raw ambition. It's about winning. It doesn't even matter what they win. It's to which to me is crazy. But I think that's a shadow\nthat some people explore, not one I've explored. I think the shadow parts\nof us are very important to come to understand and look, better to understand them\nand know that they're there and work with them than to not\nacknowledge their presence, and have them surface in the\nform of addictions or behaviors that damage us and other people. - So one of the processes\nfor achieving mental health is to bring those things to the surface. So fish the subconscious mind. - Yes, and you know, Paul describes 10 cupboards\nthat one can look into for exploring the self. There's the structure of self\nand the function of self. Again, this will all be\nspelled out in this series in a lot of detail also in\nterms of its relational aspect between people, how to pick good partners and good relations. It gets really into this from\na very different perspective. Yeah, fascinating stuff. I was just sitting there, just... I will say this, that four\nepisode series with Paul is at least to date,\nthe most important work I've ever been involved\nin, in all of my career. Because it's very clear\nthat we are not taught how to explore our subconscious. And that very few people actually\nunderstand how to do that. Even most psychiatrists, he mentioned something\nabout psychiatrists. You know, if you're a\ncardiothoracic surgeon or something like that and\n50% of your patients die, you're considered a bad\ncardiothoracic surgeon. But with no disrespect to psychiatrists, there are some excellent\npsychiatrists out there. There are also a lot of terrible\npsychiatrists out there. Because unless all of those, all of their patients commit\nsuicide or half commit suicide, they can treat for a long time\nwithout it becoming visible that they're not so good at their craft. Now he's superb at his craft. And I think he would say that,\nyes, exploring some shadows, but also just understanding the self. Like what, you know,\nreally understanding like, who am I and what's important? What are my ambitions? What are my strivings? Again, I'm lifting from some of the things that he'll describe\nexactly how to do this. People do not spend enough time\naddressing those questions. And as a consequence, they discover what resides\nin their subconscious through the sometimes\nbad, hopefully also good, but manifestations of their actions. We are driven by this huge 90% of our real estate that is not visible to our conscious awareness. And we need to understand that, you know, I've talked about this before, I've done therapy twice\na week since I was a kid. I had to, as a condition of\nbeing let back in school, I continue, I found a way\nto either through insurance or even when I didn't have insurance, I took an extra job writing\nfor Thrasher Magazine when I was a postdoc so I could pay for therapy at a discount 'cause I didn't make\nmuch money as a postdoc. I mean, I think for me, it's as important as going to the gym. And people think it's just, oh, you know, ruminating on problems\nor getting, no, no, no. If you work with somebody really good, they're forcing you to ask questions about who you really are,\nwhat you really want. It's not just about support,\nbut there should be support, there should be rapport, but then it's also, there\nshould be insight, right?"

      "section": "Betrayal and loyalty",
      "text": "Most people who get therapy,\nthey're getting support. There's rapport, but insight is not easy to arrive at. And a really good\npsychologist or psychiatrist can help you arrive at deep insights that transform your entire life. - Well, sometimes when I look\ninside, and I do this often, you know, exploring who you truly are, you come to this question, do I accept once you see parts, do I accept this or do I fix this? Is this who you are fundamentally, and it will always be this way? Or is this a problem to be fixed? Like, for example, one of the things, especially recently, but in general over time\nI've discovered about myself probably has roots in childhood, probably has roots in a lot of things, is I deeply value loyalty maybe more than the average person. And so when there's disloyalty,\nit can be painful to me. And so this is who I am, and\nso do I have to relax a bit? Do I have to fix this part?\nOr is this who you are? And there's a million,\nthat's one like little... - I think loyalty is a\ngood thing to cling to, provided that when loyalty is broken, that it doesn't disrupt too\nmany other areas of your life. But it spends also on who's\ndisrupting that loyalty, if it's a coworker\nversus a romantic partner versus your exclusive romantic partner, depending on the structure of your romantic partner life, you know, I mean, I have always experienced extreme joy and feelings of safety, and trust in my friendships. Again, mostly male friendships, but female friendships\ntoo, which is only to say that they were mostly male friendships. The female friendships\nhave also been very loyal. You know, so getting backstabbed is not something I'm familiar with. And yeah, I love being crude up, you know? - Yeah, yeah, no, for\nsure and I'm with you, and you know, you and I are very much have the same values on this, but you know, that's one little thing. And then there's many other things, like I'm extremely self-critical. Then you look at my, you know, I look at myself as, I'm\nregularly very self-critical, there's a self-critical\nengine in my brain. And I talked to actually Paul about this, I think on the podcast quite a bit. And he's saying, this\nis a really bad thing. Like, you need to fix this. You need to be able to be\nregularly very positive about yourself. And I kept disagreeing with him. No, this is like who I am. And he seems to work, don't mess with a thing that\nseems to be working, it's fine. Like I oscillate between\nbeing really grateful and really self-critical. But then you have to like\nfigure out what is it, maybe there's a deeper root thing. Maybe there's an insecurity\nin there somewhere that has to do with childhood and then you're trying to\nprove something to somebody from your childhood, this kind of thing. - Well, a couple things that\nI think are hopefully valuable for people here. One is one way to destroy your life is to spend time trying to control your or somebody else's past. So much of our destructive behavior and thinking comes from wanting something that we saw or did, or\nheard to not be true, rather than really working\nwith that and getting close to what it really was. And you know, sometimes those\nthings are even traumatic and we need to really get close to them and for them to move through us. And that, you know, there\nare a bunch of different ways to do that with support\nfrom others and hopefully, but sometimes on our own as well. I don't think we can\nrewire our deep preferences and what we find despicable or joyful. I do think that it's really a question\nof what allows us peace. Like, can you be at peace with the fact that you're very self-critical and enjoy that, get some distance from it, have a sense of humor about it or is it driving you in a way that's keeping you awake at night and forcing you back to the\ntable to do work in a way that feels self-flagellating\nand doesn't feel good. You know, can you get that\nhumility and awareness of how you're, you know,\nof your one's flaws? And I think that can create, you know, this word space sounds very new agey, like get space from it. It's, you know, you can\nhave a sense of humor about how, you know,\nneurotic, we can all be, I mean, you know, neurotic isn't actually a bad term in the classic\nsense of the psychologists and psychiatrists, the freudians. So that, you know, the best\ncase is to be neurotic, to actually see one's own\nissues and work with them. Whereas psychotic is the other way to be, which is obviously not good. So I think the question whether\nor not to work on something or to just accept it as part of ourselves, I think really depends if we feel like it's\nholding us back or not. And I think you're asking perhaps\nthe most profound question about being a human, which is, you know, what do you do with your body? What do you do with your mind? I mean, it's also a question. We started off talking\nabout fitness a little bit. We just, for whatever reason, you know, do I need to\nrun an ultra marathon? I don't feel like I need to. David Goggins does, and does\na whole lot more than that. So that for him, that's important. For me, it's not important to do that. I don't think he does it just\nso he can run the ultras. There's clearly something\nelse in there for him. And guys like Cam Hanes and tremendous respect for what\nthey do and how they do it. Does one need to make their\nbody more muscular, stronger, more endurance, more flexibility? Do you need to read harder books? Do you need to, I think\ndoing hard things feels good. I think it, I know it feels good. I know that the worst I feel, the worst way to feel is\nwhen I'm procrastinating and I don't do something. And then whenever I do\nsomething and I complete it, and I break through that\npoint where it was hard and then I'm doing it, at the end, I actually\nfeel like I was infused with some sort of super chemical. And who knows if it's probably a cocktail of endogenously made chemicals. But I think it is good to do hard things, but you have to be careful\nnot to destroy your body, your mind in the process. And I think it's about whether\nor not you can achieve peace. Can you sleep well at night? Stress isn't bad if you\ncan sleep well at night. You can be stressed all day,\ngo, go, go, go, go, go, go, and it'll optimize your focus. But can you fall asleep and\nstay deeply asleep at night? Being in a hard relationship. Some people say, you\nknow, that's not good. Other people like it. Can you be at peace in that? And I think we all, you know, have different RPM that, you know, we all kinda idle at different RPM and some people are big mellow Costellos, and others are kind of like, you know, need more friction in\norder to feel at peace. But I think ultimately what\nwe want is to feel at peace. - Yeah, I've been through\nsome really low points over the past couple years and I think the reason could be boiled down to the fact that I\nhaven't been able to find a place of peace, a place or people, or moments\nthat give deep inner peace. Yeah, you know, and I think you put it really beautifully. You have to figure out, given who you are, the various characteristics\nof your mind, all the things, all the contents of the cupboards, how to get space from it. And ultimately, one good\nrepresentation of that is to be able to laugh at all of it. Whatever's going on inside your mind to be able to step back\nand just kinda chuckle at the beauty and the\nabsurdity of the whole thing. - Yeah, and keep going. There's this beautiful, as I mentioned, it seems like every podcast lately, I'm a huge Rancid fan, mostly 'cause I just think\nTim Armstrong's writing is pure poetry and whether or\nnot you like the music or not, you know, and he's written music for a lot of other people too. He's not, doesn't advertise that much 'cause he's humble, but- - [Lex] And that by the way,\nI went to a show of theirs like 20 years ago.\n- Oh yeah? I'm gonna see them in\nBoston, September 18th. I'm literally flying there for, or I'll take the train up from New York. I'm gonna meet a friend of\nmine named Jim Thiebaud, who's a big guy who\nowns a lot of companies, the skateboard industry. We're meeting there like\na couple little kids to go see them play. Amazing people, amazing music. - Very intense.\n- Very intense, but embodies all the different emotions. That's why I love it, right? They have some love songs,\nthey have some hate songs, they have some, but you know, going back to what you said,\nI think there's a song, the first song on the\nIndestructible album, I think there's a, it's sort of, he's just\ntalking about like shock and disbelief of discovering\nthings about people that were close to you, and, you know, I won't sing it, but, you know, nor I wouldn't dare. But there's this one lyric\nwhere that's really stuck in my mind for ever since\nthat album came out in 2003, which is, you know, that\nnothing's what it seems, so I just sit here laughing,\nI'm gonna keep going on. I can't get distracted. There is this piece of like,\nyou gotta learn how to push out the disturbing stuff\nsometimes and go forward. And I mean, I remember hearing that lyric and then writing it down and, you know, that was a time where my\nundergraduate advisor, who was like a mentor and a father to me, you know, blew his head off in the bathtub like three weeks before. And then my graduate advisor, who I was working for at that\ntime, who I loved and adored, was really like a mother to me. I knew her when she was\npregnant with her two kids died at 50, breast cancer. And then my postdoc advisor,\nyou know, first day of work at Stanford as a faculty\nmember sitting across the table like this from him, had a heart\nattack right in front of me, died of pancreatic cancer\nat the end of 2017. And I remember just thinking like, you know, going back to that\nsong lyric over and over, like, and where people would, you know, I haven't had many betrayals in life. I've had a few, but just thinking like, or seeing something or learning something about something you just,\nlike, you can't believe it. And I mentioned that\nlyric off that first song, Indestructible on that album because it's this like, just\nthe raw emotion of like, I can't believe this, what\nI just saw is so disturbing, but I have to just keep going forward. There are certain things that\nwe really do need to push, not just into our periphery, but often to the gutter and keep going. And that's a hard thing\nto learn how to do. But if you're going to be\nfunctional in life, you have to. And actually just to get at\nthis issue of do I change or do I embrace this aspect of self? About six months, it was April of this last year, I did some intense work around some things that were\nreally challenging to me. And I did it alone, and it may have involved some medicine. And I expected to get peace through this. I was like, I'm gonna let go of it, and I spent 11 hours just\ngetting more and more frustrated and angry about this thing\nthat I was trying to resolve. And I was so unbelievably disappointed that I couldn't get that relief. And I was like, what is this? Like this is not how\nthis is supposed to work. I'm supposed to be feel peace. The clouds are supposed to lift. And so a week went by and then another half week went by, and then someone whose\nopinion I trust very much, I explained this to them because I was getting a\nlittle concerned like, what's going on? This\nis worse, not better. And they said, \"This is very simple. You have a giant blind spot, which is your sense of justice, Andrew, and your sense of anger are linked like an iron rod and\nyou need to relax it.\" And as they said that, I\nfelt the anger dissipate. And so there was something\nthat I think is, it is true. I have a very strong sense of\njustice and my sense of anger then at least, was very\nstrongly linked to it. So it's great to have a\nsense of justice, right? I hate to see people wronged. I absolutely do. And I'm human, I'm sure I've\nwronged people in my life. I know I have, they've told me, I've tried to apologize and\nreconcile where possible, still have a lot of work to do. But where I see injustice, it draws in my sense of anger in a way that I think is just eating me up. And, but it was only in hearing that link that I wasn't aware of before, it was in my subconscious, obviously. Did I feel the relaxation? It wasn't, there's no\namount of plant medicine or MDMA or any kind of, you know, chemical you can take that's naturally just going to dissipate\nwhat's hard for oneself. It needs, if one embraces that or if one chooses to do it\nthrough just talk therapy or journaling, or\nfriends, or introspection, or all of the above, there needs to be an\nawareness of the things that we're just not aware of. So I think the answer to your question, do you embrace or do you fight\nthese aspects of self is, I think you get in your subconscious through good work with\nsomebody skilled or, and sometimes that involves\nthe tools I just mentioned in various combinations,\nand you figure it out. You figure out if it's serving you. Obviously, it was not bringing me peace. It was undermining my sense of justice, was undermining my sense of peace. And so in understanding this link be... Now, I would say that the, in understanding this link\nbetween justice and anger, now, I think it's a\nlittle bit more of like a, you know, it's not like\na Twizzler stick bendy, but it's at least, it's\nnot like an iron rod. Like, you know, when I\nsee somebody wronged, I mean, it used to just like,\n(puffs) like immediately. - But you're able to step\nback now that's like to me, the ultimate place to reach is laughter. - I just sit here laughing. Exactly, that's the lyric,\nI like, I can't believe it. So I just sit here laughing like, can't get distracted. Just you at some point, but the problem I think in\njust laughing at something, like that gives you distance. But the question is, do you stop engaging\nwith it at that point? Like, I experienced this, I mean, recently, I got\nto see how sometimes I'll see something that's just like, what? Like this is crazy so I just laugh, but then I continue to engage in it and it's taking me off course. And so there is a place where, you know, I mean, I realize\nthis is probably a kid show too, so I want to keep it, you know, G-rated, but at some point for certain things, it makes sense to go, fuck that. - But also laugh at yourself\nfor saying fuck that. - Yeah, and then move on. So the question is, do you get stuck or do you move on, right? - Sure, but like, there's\na lightness of being that comes with laughter. I mean, I've gotten...\n- Sure. - Like, as you know, I spent\nthe day with Elon today. He just gave me this burnt hair. Do you know what this is? - [Andrew] I have no idea. - I'm sure there's actually, there should be a Huberman\nlab episode on this. It's a cologne that's burnt hair. - I see.\n- And it's like supposedly a really intense smell. And it is.\n- Give me a smell. - [Lex] Do please, it's not gonna leave your nose.\n- That's okay. Well, that's okay, I'll take a gent... I'll whiff it as if I were whiffing a chemical in the lab.\n- You have to actually spray it on yourself. 'cause I don't know if you can- - So I'm reading an amazing book called \"An Immense World\" by Ed Yong. He won a Pulitzer for\n\"We Contain Multitudes\" or something like that, I think is the title of the other book. And the first chapter\nis all about olfaction and the incredible power\nthat olfaction has. That smells terrible. I don't even-\n- And it doesn't leave you. For those listening, it doesn't quite smell terrible. It's just intense and it stays with you. This to me represents like just laughing at\nthe absurdity of it all. - So I have to ask, so you\nwere rolling jiu-jitsu? - [Lex] Yeah, we're\ntraining jiu-jitsu, yeah. - So is that fight between Elon and Zuck actually gonna happen? - I think Elon is a huge\nbeliever of this idea of the most entertaining\noutcomes is the most likely. And he almost like,\nthere's almost the sense that there's not a free\nwill and the universe has a kinda deterministic\ngravitational field pulling towards the most fun and he's\njust a player in that game. So from that perspective, I think it seems like something\nlike that is inevitable. - Like a little scrap in the parking lot of a Facebook or something like that.\n- Exactly. - Sorry, Meta.\n- Yeah. - But it looks like\nthey're training for real, and Zuck has competed right in jiu-jitsu? - So I think he is\napproaching it as a sport. Elon is approaching it as a spectacle. And I mean, the way he talks about it, he's a huge fan of history. He talks about all the\nwarriors that have fought throughout history. If you look, he wants to\nreally do it at the Colosseum. And you know, the\nColosseum is for 400 years, there's so many, so much\ngreat writing about this. I think over 400,000 people have died in the Colosseum, Gladiators. So this is this historic place\nthat sheds so much blood, so much fear, so much anticipation\nof battle, all of this. So he loves this kinda spectacle. And also, the meme of it, the hilarious absurdity of it, that two tech CEOs battling it out on sand in a place where gladiators\nfought to the death and then bears and lion ate prisoners as part of the execution process. - Well, it's also gonna be an instance where Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk gets to change bodily fluids. If they bleed, there's one\nthing's about fighting, you know? I think it was in that book, it's a great book \"Fighter's Heart,\" where he talks about, you\nknow, the sort of the intimacy of sparring. I only rolled jiu-jitsu with you once, but there was a period\nof time where I boxed and which I don't recommend. I got hit, I hit some guys\nand definitely got hit back. I'd spar on Wednesday nights\nwhen I lived on San Diego. And you know, when you spar with somebody, even if they hurt you,\nespecially if they hurt you, you know, you see that person afterwards and there's an intimacy, right? It was in that book \"Fire's\nHeart\" where he explains, you know, you're exchanging bodily fluids with a stranger, right? And you're in your primitive mind, and so there's an intimacy\nthere that persists, so. - You go together through a\nprocess of fear, anxiety, like- - Yeah, when they get you, you nod. I mean, you watch somebody like\ncatch somebody if, you know, not so much in professional fighting, but if people are sparring\nthat they catch you, you acknowledge that they caught you, like you got me there. - And on the flip side of that, so we trained and then after\nthat we played Diablo IV. - [Andrew] I don't know what that is. I don't play video games, sorry. - But it's a video game. So it's like, it's a, you know, pretty intense combat in the video. You know, you're fighting like demons and- - Oh, okay. The last video game I played\nwas Mike Tyson's \"Punch Out.\" - [Lex] There, you go. That's pretty close.\n- I met him recently, went on his podcast. - [Lex] You went, wait... - It hasn't come out yet.\n- Oh, it hasn't come out yet, okay.\n- Yeah. Yeah, I asked Mike, his kids are great. They came in and they're super smart kids. Goodness gracious. They ask great questions. I asked Mike what he did with\nthe piece of a Evander's ear that he bit off and said-\n- Did he remember? - He's like, gave it\nback to him. (chuckles) - [Lex] There you go, sorry about that. - He sells edibles that\nare in the shape of ears with a little bite out of it. Yeah, his life has been incredible. He's intimate. Yeah, his family are, you get the sense that\nthey're really a great family. They're really...\n- Mike Tyson? That's a heck of a journey\nright there of a man. - Yeah, my now friend, Tim Armstrong, like I said, lead singer\nfrom Rancid, he put it best. He said, you know, that\nMike Tyson's life is, you know, Shakespearean and you know, down, up, down, up. And just that the arcs\nof his life are just like sort of an only in America\nkinda tale too, right?"

      "section": "Drama",
      "text": "- So, speaking of Shakespeare, I've recently gotten to know Neri Oxman, who's this incredible scientist that works at the intersection\nof nature and engineering. And she reminded me of\nthis Anna Akhmatova line, this is this great Soviet\npoet that I really love from over a century ago that, \"Each of our lives is a\nShakespearean drama raised to the thousand degree.\" So I have to ask, why do you think humans are attracted to this kind of Shakespearean drama? Is there some aspect\nwe've been talking about the subconscious mind that\npulls us towards the drama, even though the place of\nmental health is peace? - Yes, and yes. - Do you have some of that? - Draw towards drama? Yeah. - [Lex] If you look at the empirical data. - Yes, I mean... Right, if I look at the empirical data, I mean, I think about\nwho I chose to work for as an undergraduate, right? I was, you know, barely\nfinished high school, finally get to college, barely. I think... This is really embarrassing\nand not something to aspire to, you know, I was, you know,\nthrown outta the dorms for fighting, barely passed\nmy classes, you know, the girlfriend and I split up. I mean, I was living in a\nsquad, got into a big fight. I was getting in trouble with the law. Eventually got my act\ntogether, go back to school, start working for somebody, who do I choose to work for? A guy who's an ex-navy\nguy who smokes cigarettes in the fume hood, drinks coffee, and we're injecting rats with MDMA. And, you know, I was drawn\nto like the personality, his energy, but also, he\nwas a great scientist. Worked out a lot on a thermal regulation in the brain and more, you know, go to graduate\nschool, I'm working for somebody and decide that yeah, doing,\nworking in her laboratory wasn't quite right for me. So I'm literally sneaking\ninto the laboratory next door and working for the woman next door because I liked the\nrelationships that she had to a certain set of questions. And she was a kind of a quirky person. And, you know, so drawn to drama, but drawn to, I like characters. I like people that have texture. And I'm not drawn to raw ambition. I'm drawn to people that\nseem to have a real passion for what they do and a uniqueness to them that I, you know, you\ncan kind of, not kind of, I'll just say how it is. I can feel their heart for what they do. And I'm drawn to that, like... And that can be good. The same reason I went to work\nfor Ben Barres as a postdoc, it wasn't because he was\nthe first transgender member of the National Academy of Sciences. That was just a feature of who he was. I loved how he loved Glia. He would talk about these cells like they were the most enchanting things that he'd ever seen in his life. And I was like, this is like\nthe biggest nerd I've ever met, and I love him. I think I'm drawn to that. This is another thing that\nConti makes elaborates on quite a bit more in the series on\nmental health coming out. But there are different drives within us. There are aggressive drives,\nnot always for fighting, but for intense interaction. I mean, look at Twitter, look at people clearly\nhave an aggressive drive. There's also a pleasure drive. Some people also have a\nstrong pleasure drive. They want to experience\npleasure through food, through sex, through friendship, through adventure, you know? But I think the Shakespearean\ndrama is the drama of the different drives\nin different ratios in different people. I know somebody and she's incredibly kind, has an extremely high pleasure drive, loves taking great care of\nherself and people around her through food and through retreats, and through all these things, and makes spaces beautiful\neverywhere she goes. And gifts, these things that are just so unbelievably\nfeminine and incredible. These gifts to people and\nthe kind and thoughtful about what they like. And then, but I would say\nvery little aggressive drive from my read. And then I know other people\nwho are just have a ton of aggressive drive and\nvery little pressure drive. And I think, so there's this alchemy that exists where people have these things in different ratios,\nand then you blend in, you know, the differences\nin the chromosomes and differences in hormones, and differences in personal history, and what you end up with is a species that creates incredible recipes of drama, but also peace, also relief\nfrom drama, contentment. I mean, I realize this\nisn't the exact topic of the question, but someone I know very dearly, actually an ex-girlfriend of\nmine, long-term partner of mine sent me something recently\nand I think it hit the nail on the head, which is\nthat ideally for a man, they eventually settle where\nthey find and feel peace. Where they feel peaceful, where they can be themselves\nand feel peaceful. Now, I'm sure there's a equivalent or mirror image of that for women, but this particular post\nthat she sent was about men. And I totally agree. And so it isn't always that\nwe're seeking friction, but for periods of our life,\nwe seek friction, drama, adventure, excitement, fights, you know, and doing hard, hard things. And then I think at some point, I'm certainly coming to this\npoint now where it's like, yeah, that's all great and\nchecked a lot of boxes, but had a lot of close calls, flew really close to the sun\non a lot of things with life and limb, and heart and spirit. And some of, you know, people\nclose to us didn't make it. And sometimes not making it means the career they wanted went off a cliff or their health went off a cliff, or their life went off a cliff. But I think that there's\nalso the Shakespearean drama of the characters that exit the play and are living their lives\nhappily in the backdrop. It just doesn't make for\nas much entertainment. - That's one other thing that's a benefit, you could say is the\nbenefit of getting older is finding the Shakespearean\ndrama less appealing or finding the joy in the peace. - Yeah, definitely. I mean, I think that, I think\nthere's real peace with age. I think the other thing is this notion of checking\nboxes is a real thing, for me anyway. I have a morning meditation that I do, well, I wake up now, I get\nmy sunlight, I hydrate, I use the bathroom, I do all\nthe things that I talk about. I've started a practice of\nprayer in the last year, which is new-ish for me, which is, we could talk about it if you want.\n- In the morning? - Yeah.\n- Can you talk about it a little bit?\n- Sure, yeah. And then I have a meditation that I do that actually is where I think through with the different roles that I play. So like, I start very basic. I say, you know, okay, I'm an animal. Like we are like,\nbiologically animals, right? Human, you know, I'm a man,\nI'm a scientist, I'm a teacher, I'm a friend, I'm a brother, I'm a son, you know, I go through\nthis, I have this list and I think about the\ndifferent roles that I have and the roles that I still\nwant in my life going forward that I haven't yet fulfilled. It just takes me, it's\nsort of an inventory of where I've been, where I'm at, and where I'm going as they say. And I don't know why I do it, but I started doing it this last year, I think because it helps me understand just how many different\ncontexts I have to exist in and remind myself that there's still more that I haven't done\nthat I'm excited about. - So within each of those contexts, there's like things that you\nwant to kind of accomplish, to define that. - Yeah, and I'm ambitious so I think, you know, I'm a brother. I have an older sister and\nI love her tremendously. And I think like, I wanna be the best\nbrother I can be to her. Which means maybe a call, maybe just, you know, we do an annual trip\ntogether for our birthdays. Our birthdays are close together. We always go to New York for our birthdays and we've gone for the\nlast three, four years, like really like reminding\nmyself of that role, not because I'll forget, but because I have all these other roles I'll get pulled into. I say the first one, I'm an animal because I have to remember\nthat I have a body that needs care, like any of us. I need sleep, I need food,\nI need hydration, I need... That I'm human, that the brain of a human is marvelously complex, but also marvelously\nself-defeating at times. And so I've been thinking\nabout these things in the context of the different roles. And the whole thing takes\nabout four or five minutes. And I just find it brings me\na certain amount of clarity that then allows me to\nratchet into the day. The prayer piece, yeah, I think I've been\nreluctant to talk about until now because I don't believe in\npushing religion on people. And I think that, and I'm not. It's a highly individual thing. And I do believe that\none can be an atheist and still pray or agnostic and still pray. But for me, it really came\nabout through understanding that there are certain aspects of myself that I just couldn't resolve on my own. And no matter how much therapy, no matter how much, and I\nhaven't done a lot of it, but no matter how much plant medicine or other forms of medicine, or exercise, or podcasting, or science, or friendship, or any of that, I was\njust not going to resolve. And so I started this because someone close to me said, a male friend said, \"You\nknow, prayer is powerful.\" And I said, \"Well, how?\" And he said, \"I don't know\nhow, but if you can get... It can allow you to get outside yourself, let you give up control, and\nat the same time take control.\" I don't even like saying take control. But the whole notion is that, and again, forgive me, but there's no other way to say it. The whole notion is that, you know, like God works through us, whatever God is to you,\nhe, him, her, whatever, life force, like nature,\nwhatever it is to you, right? That it works through us. And so I do a prayer,\nI'll just describe it, where I ask, I make an ask\nto help remove my defects, my character defects. I pray to God to help\nremove my character defects so that I can show up better\nin all the roles of my life and do good work. Like to, which for me is\nlearning and teaching. Learning and teaching. And so you might say,\nwell, how is that different than a meditation? Well, I'm acknowledging\nthat there is something that bigger than me, bigger\nthan nature as I understand it, that I cannot understand or\ncontrol, nor do I want to. And I'm just giving over to that. And does that make me less of a scientist? I sure as hell hope not. I certainly know, there's\nthe head of our neurosciences at Stanford until recently. You should talk to him directly about it. Bill Newsome has talked\nabout his religious life. For me, it's really a way\nof getting outside myself and then understanding how I\nfit into this bigger picture. And the character defects\npart is real, right? I'm a human, I have defects, like I got a lot of flaws\nin me, like anybody. But, and trying to acknowledge them and asking for help in\nremoving them, not magically, but through right action,\nthrough my right action. So I do that every morning. And I have to say that it's\nhelped, it's helped a lot. It's helped me be better to myself, be better at other people. I still make mistakes, but it's becoming a\nbigger part of my life. And I never thought I'd talk like this, but I think it's clear to me that if we don't believe in something, again, doesn't have to be traditional, standardized religion, but if we don't believe in\nsomething bigger than ourselves, we at some level will self-destruct. I really think so. And it's powerful in a way\nthat all the other stuff, meditation, all the tools is not because it's really operating at a much deeper and bigger level. And, you know, yeah, I think that's all I can talk about it, mostly because I'm still working out, you know, the scientists\nin me wants to understand how it works, and I wanna understand. And the point is to just go, you know, there's you know, for lack of a better language for it, there's higher power than\nme and what I can control, I'm giving up control on certain things. And somehow that restores\na sense of agency for right action, better action. - I think perhaps a part of\nthat is just the humility that comes with acknowledging\nthere's something bigger and more powerful than you. - And you can't control everything. I mean, that you go through\nlife as a hard-driving person, you know, forward center of mass. I remember being that\nway since I was little. It's like a new Legos, I'm like, I'm gonna make all the Legos. And it was like on the weekends, you know, learning about medieval weapons and then giving lectures about it in class when I was five or six years old, or learning about tropical fish and, you know, cataloging\nall of them at the store, and then organizing it and making my, you know, my dad drive\nme or my mom drive me to some fish store and then\nspending all my time there until they throw me out,\nyou know, all of that, but I also remember my entire\nlife, I would secretly pray. When things were good\nand things weren't good, but mostly when things were weren't good 'cause it's important to pray, for me, it's important to\npray each morning regardless. But when things weren't right, I couldn't get make sense of\n'em, I would secretly pray, but I felt kind of ashamed\nof that for whatever reason. And then it was once in\ncollege, I distinctly remember, I was having a hard time\nwith a number of things and I took a run down to Sands Beach, it was UC, Santa Barbara. And I remember I just, I was like, I don't know if I even\nhave the right to do this, but I'm just praying and I just prayed for the ability to be as\nbrutally honest with myself and with other people\nas I possibly could be about a particular situation\nI was in at that time. I mean, I think now it's\nprobably safe to say, I'd gone off to college 'cause\nof a high school girlfriend. We had, essentially, she\nwas my family, more frankly, more than my biological family was at a certain stage of life. And we'd reached a point\nwhere we were diverging and it was incredibly painful. It was like losing everything I had. And it was like, what do I do? How do I manage this? Do I, you know, I was ready to quit and join the fire service\njust to support us so that we could move forward. And you know, it was just, but praying, just saying, I can't\nfigure this out on my own. It's sort of like I can't\nfigure this out on my own. And how frustrating that is\nthat no number of friends could tell me, or, and in\nher wisdom couldn't tell me. And eventually, it led\nme to the right answers. And she and I are are\nfriendly friends to this day. She's happily married with a\nchild and we're on good terms, but I think, you know, it's a scary thing, but it's the best thing when you just, I can't control all this. And asking for help, I\nthink is also the piece. You're not asking for some\nmagic hand to come down and take care of it. You're asking for the help\nto come through you, right? So that your body is used\nto do these right works, right action. - Isn't it interesting\nthat this secret thing that you're almost embarrassed by, that you did it as a\nchild is something you, it's another thing you\ndo as you get older, as you realize, like those\nthings are part of you, it's actually a beautiful thing. - Yeah, a lot of the content\nof the podcast is, you know, deep academic content and we\ntalk about everything from, you know, eating disorders\nto bipolar disorders, to depression, you know,\na lot of different topics, but the tools or the\nprotocols as we say, right? The sunlight viewing and all the rest, you know, a lot of that\nstuff is just stuff I wish I'd known when I\nwas in graduate school. If I'd known to go outside\nevery once in a while and get some sunlight,\nnot just stay in the lab, I would've, you know, I might not have hit like a really tough round of depression when I was a postdoc and\nworking twice as hard. And, you know, when my\nbody would break down or I'd get sick a lot, I\ndon't get sick much anymore. Occasionally, about once\nevery 18 months to two years maybe I'll get something, but you know, I used to\nbreak my foot skateboarding all the time, I couldn't\nunderstand what's wrong with my body, I'm getting injured, I can't do what everyone else can. Now I developed more slowly,\nI had a long arc of puberty, but so that was part of\nit, I was still developing, but you know, how to\nget your body stronger, how to build endurance? Like no one told me, the\ninformation wasn't there. So a lot of what I put out\nthere is the information that I wish I had because once I had it, I was like, wow! Like A, this stuff really works. B, it's grounded in something real. You know, sometimes certain protocols are a combination of,\nyou know, animal, human, and animal, and human studies,\nsometimes clinical trials, sometimes there's some\nmechanistic conjecture for some, not all, I\nalways make clear which. But in the end, like figuring out how things\nwork so that we can be happier, healthier, more productive, suffer less, like reduce the suffering of the world. And I think that, well, I'll just say thank you and for asking about the prayer piece. Again, I'm not pushing or\neven encouraging it on anyone, I've just found it to be\ntremendously useful for me."

      "text": "- (sighs) You know, I mean\nabout prayer in general, you said information and\nfiguring out how to get stronger, healthier, smarter, all\nthose kinds of things. A part of me believes\nthat deeply, you know? You can gain a lot of knowledge\nand wisdom through learning. But a part of me believes\nthat all the wisdom I need was there when I was 11 and 12 years old. - And then it got cluttered over. Well, listen, I can't wait for\nyou and Conti to talk again. Because when he gets going\nabout the subconscious and the amount of this\nthat sits below the surface like an iceberg and the\nfact that when we're kids, we're not obscuring a lot of\nthat subconscious as much. And sometimes that can look\na little more primitive. I mean, that kid that's\ndisappointed will let you know, that kid that's excited will let you know. And you feel that raw\nexuberance or that raw dismay. And I think that as we grow older, we learn to cover that stuff up. We wear masks and we have\nto, to be functional, right? I don't think we all wanna go around just being completely raw. But as you said, as you\nget older, you also, you get to this point\nwhere you kind of go, eh, you know, what are we\nreally trying to protect anyway? I mean, I have this theory that, you know, certainly my\nexperience has taught me that a lot of people, but I'll talk about men 'cause that's what I know best. Whether or not they show up strong or not, that they're really afraid of being weak. Like they're just afraid. Like sometimes the strength is even a way to try and not be weak, right? Which is different than being\nstrong for its own sake. I'm not just talking\nabout physical strength, I'm talking about intellectual strength. I'm talking about money. I'm talking about expressing drive. I've been watching this series a little bit of \"Chimp Empire-\" - Oh, yeah. - So Chimp Empire is amazing, right? They have the head chimp,\nhe's not the head chimp, but the alpha in the group. And he's getting older. And so what does he do? Every once in a while he\ngoes on these vigor displays. He goes and he grabs branch. He starts breaking him and\nhe starts thrashing 'em, and he's incredibly strong, and they're all kind like watching. I mean, yeah, I\nimmediately think of people like they're deadlifting on Instagram and I just think, displays a vigor. This is just the primate\nshowing that displays a vigor. Now what's interesting is that\nhe's doing that specifically to say, Hey, I still have what it takes to lead this troop, okay? Then there're the ones that\nare subordinate to him, but not so far behind- - It seems to be that\nthere's a very clear, like numerical ranking. - There is.\n- Like, it's clear who's the number two, number three? - Oh yeah.\n- I mean, probably- - Who gets to mate first? Who gets to eat first? This exists in other animal societies too, but Bob Sapolsky would be a great person to talk about this with 'cause he knows obviously,\ntremendous amount about it. And I know just the top contour, but yeah, so number two,\nthree and four males are aware that he's doing\nthese vigor displays, but they're also aware because in primate evolution they got some extra forebrain\ntoo, not as much as us, but they got some, and they're aware that the\nvigor displays are displays that because they've done them as\nwell in a different context, might not just be displays of vigor, but might also be an insurance policy against people seeing weakness. Okay, so now they start\nusing that prefrontal cortex to do some interesting things. So in primate world, if a male is friendly with\nanother male wants to affiliate with him and say, Hey, I'm backing you, they'll go over and they'll\npick off the little parasites and eat them. And so the grooming is\nextremely important. In fact, if they want to ostracize or kill one of the members of their troop, they will just leave it alone. No one will groom it. And then there's actually a\nreally disturbing sequence in that show of then the parasites start to eat away on their skin. They get infections, they have issues, no one will mate with them, no one, they have other issues as\nwell and can potentially die. So the interesting thing\nis, is number two and three start to line up a\nstrategy to groom this guy, but they are actually\nthinking about overtaking the entire troop, setting in a new alpha. But the current alpha did\nthat to get where he is. So he knows that they're\ndoing this grooming thing, but they might not be\nsincere about the grooming. So what does he do? He takes the whole troop\non a raid to another troop and sees who will fight\nfor him and who won't. This is advanced contracting of behavior for a species that\nnormally we don't think of as sophisticated as us."

      "section": "Overt vs covert contracts",
      "text": "So it's very interesting\nand it gets to something that I hope we'll have an\nopportunity to talk about 'cause it's something that\nI'm obsessed with lately is this notion of overt versus\ncovert contracts, right? There are overt contracts where\nyou exchange work for money or you exchange any number\nof things in an overt way. But then there are covert contracts. And those take on a very different form and always lead to, in\nmy belief, bad things. - Well, how much of human\nand chimp relationships are overt versus covert? - Well, here's one thing\nthat we know is true. Dogs and humans, the dog to human\nrelationship is 100% overt. They don't manipulate you. Now you could say they do\nin the sense that they learn that if they look a certain\nway or roll on their back, they get food. But there's no banking of that behavior for a future date where then\nthey're going to undermine you and take your position, okay? So in that sense, dogs can\nbe a little bit manipulative in some sense, but. Now, okay, so overt contract would be, we both wanna do some work together. We're gonna make some money. You get X percentage, I get\nX percentage, it's overt. Covert contract, which is,\nin my opinion, always bad would be, we're gonna\ndo some work together. You're gonna get a percentage of money, I'm gonna get a percentage of money, could look just like the overt contract, but secretly, I'm resentful\nthat I got the percentage I got. So what I start doing is\ncovertly taking something else. What do I take? Maybe I take the opportunity\nto jab you verbally every once in a while. Maybe I take the\nopportunity to show up late. Maybe I take the opportunity to get to know one of your coworkers so that I might start\na business with them. That's covert contracting. And you see this sometimes\nin romantic relationships. One person, we won't\nset the male or female in any direction here and just say, I'll make you feel powerful\nif you make me feel desired. Okay, great. There's nothing explicitly\nwrong about that contract if they both know and they both agree, but what if it's, I'll do that, but I'll have kids with\nyou so you feel powerful, you'll have kids with\nme so I feel desired, but secretly, I don't want to do that. Or one person says, I don't wanna do that or both don't, so what they\nend up doing is saying, okay, so I expect something else. I expect you to do certain things for me, or I expect you to pay\nfor certain things for me. Covert contracts are the\nsignature of everything bad. Overt contracts are the\nsignature of all things good. And I think about this a lot because I've seen a lot\nof examples of this. Like anyone, we\nparticipate in these things whether or not we want to or not. And the thing that gets\ntransacted the most is, well, I should say the things that get transacted the most are the overt things. You'll see money, time, sex, property, whatever it\nhappens to be, information. But what ends up happening is that when people I believe don't feel safe, they feel threatened in some way, like they don't feel safe\nin a certain interaction, what they do is they start\ntaking something else while still engaging in the exchange. And I'll tell you, if there's one thing about\nhuman nature that's bad, it's that feature. Why that feature? Or is it a bug, or a feature\nas you engineers like to say, I think it's because we were allocated a certain extra amount\nof prefrontal cortex that makes us more\nsophisticated than a dog, more sophisticated than a\nchimpanzee, but they do it too. And it's because it's often harder to deal with, in the short-term, to deal with the real\nsense of this is scary, this feels threatening than it is to play out all the iterations. It takes a lot of brain work. You're playing chess and\ngo simultaneously try and figure out where\nthings are gonna end up, and we just don't know. So it's a way I think of creating a false sense of certainty, but I'll tell you, covert contracts, the only certainty is\nthat it's gonna end badly. The question is how badly? Conversely, overt\ncontracts always end well. Always, the problem with overt contracts is that you can't be certain\nthat the other person is not engaging in a covert contract. You can only take responsibility\nfor your own contracting. - Well, one of the\nchallenges of being human is looking at another human\nbeing and figuring out the way, their way of\nbeing, their behavior, which of the two types of\ncontracts it represents because they look awfully\nthe same on the surface. - That's right.\n- And one of the challenges of being human is the\ndecision we all make is, are you somebody that\ntakes a leap of trust and trust other humans and\nare willing to take the hurt? Or you going to be cynical and skeptical, and avoid most interactions until they over a long period\nof time prove your trust. - Yeah, I never liked the\nphrase history repeats itself when it comes to humans because it doesn't apply if the people or the person is actively working to resolve their own flaws. I do think that if people are willing to do dedicated introspective work, go into their subconscious, do the hard work, have hard conversations, and get better at hard conversations, something that I'm constantly\ntrying to get better at. I think people can change, but they have to want to change. - It does seem like deep down we all can kinda tell the difference between overt and covert. Like we have a good sense. I think one of the benefits\nof having this characteristic of mine where I value loyalty, I've been extremely fortunate to spend most of my life\nin overt relationships. And I think that creates\na really fulfilling life."

      "text": "- But there's also this thing that maybe we're in this\nportion of the podcast now, but I've experienced this-\n- That just brings us this late at night we're talking about.\n- That's right. Certainly late for me, but I'm two hours, I came in today on, I'm\nstill in California. - And we should also say\nthat you came here to wish me a happy birthday.\n- I did. I did, and- - And the podcast is just like a fun last minute thing I suggested. - Yeah, some close friends\nof yours have arranged a dinner that I'm really\nlooking forward to. I won't say which night, but it's the next couple of nights. You know, your circadian clock is one of the most robust\nfeatures of your biology. I know you can be nocturnal\nor you can be diurnal. We know you're mostly\nnocturnal at certain times of the year, Lex, but there're very, very\nfew people can get away with no sleep. Very few people can get away with a chaotic sleep wake schedule. So you have to obey a\n24-hour aka circadian rhythm if you wanna remain\nhealthy of mind and body. We also have to acknowledge that it's aging isn't linear, right? So- - What do you mean?\n- Well, I mean, the degree of change\nbetween years 35 and 40 is not gonna be the degree\nof change between 40 and 45. But I will say this, I'm 48 and I feel better in\nevery aspect of my psychology and biology now than I\ndid when I was in my 20s. Sort of quality of thought, time spent, physically I can do what I did then, which is probably says more\nabout what I could do then than what I can do now. But if you keep training, you\ncan continue to get better. The key is to not get injured. And I've never trained super hard. I've trained hard, but I've been cautious\nto not, for instance, weight train more than two days in a row. I do a split, it's\nbasically three days a week and the other days a run, take one full day-off, take a\nweek-off every 12 to 16 weeks. I've not been the guy\nhurling the heaviest weights or running the furthest distance, but I have been the guy\nwho's continuing to do it when a lot of my friends are\ntalking about knee injuries. - Hey!\n- Talking about (chuckles) - Hey, hey, hey. (chuckles)\n- I'm just... But of course, with sport, you can't account for\neverything the same way you can with fitness. And I have to acknowledge that, you know? Unless one is power lifting, you know, weightlifting and\nrunning, you can get hurt, but it's not like skateboarding where if you're going for it,\nyou're gonna get hurt. That's just, you're landing on concrete and with jiu-jitsu like\npeople are trying to hurt you so that you say stop. - No, but it-\n- So with a sport it's different. And these days, I don't\nreally do a sport any longer. I work out, stay fit. I used to continue to do sports, but I kept getting hurt and frankly now, like a rolled ankle, I may put out a little small\nskateboard part in 2024 because people have been saying\nwe wanna see the kick flip. I'll say, well, I'll do a\nheel flip instead, but okay. I might put out a little part 'cause some of the guys\nthat work on our podcast are from DC, I think by now, I should at least do it just to show like I'm not making it\nup and I probably will. But I think doing a sport is different. That's how you get hurt, overuse and doing it an actual sport. And so, you know, hat tip to\nthose who do an actual sport. - And that's a difficult decision. Like a lot of people have to make, I have to make with jiu-jitsu for example, like if you just look empirically, I've trained really hard from all my life in grappling sports and fighting sports, and all this kind of stuff. And I've avoided injury for the most part. And I would say, I would attribute that to training a lot. Sounds counterintuitive, but training well and\nsafely, and correctly, keeping good form, saying\nno when I need to say no, but training a lot and\ntaking it seriously. Now when training is kind of\na side, really a side thing, I find that the injury is\nbecomes a higher probability. - But when you're just doing\nit every once in a while. - [Lex] Every once in a while. - Yeah, I think you said\nsomething really important. The saying no, I mean, the times I have gotten hurt training is when someone's like, Hey, let's hop on this workout together and it becomes, let's challenge each other to do something outrageous. Sometimes that can be fun though. I went up to Cam Hanes's gym and he does these very high\nrepetition weight workouts that are in circuit form. I was sore for two weeks, but I learned a lot\nand didn't get injured. And yes, we ate bow hunted elk afterwards. - Nice. But the injury has been a really difficult\npsychological thing for me 'cause, so I've injured\nmy finger, pinky finger, injured my knee. - And your kitchen is filled with splints. - Splints, I'm trying to\nfigure out, (chuckles) I'm trying-\n- It's like, if you look in Lex's kitchen, there's some really good\nsnacks, I had some right before. He's very good about keeping\ncold drinks in the fridge and all the water has element\nin it, which is great. I love that. But then there's a whole like\nhospital's worth of splints. - Yeah, I'm trying. I'm trying to figure\nout, so here's the thing, a finger like pop out like this, right? Pinky finger. I'm trying to figure out how\ndo I splint in such a way that I can still program,\nstill play guitar, but protect this kind of torque motion that creates a huge amount of pain. And so-\n- That's you have a jiu-jitsu injury.\n- Jiu-jitsu, but it's not the kind of... It's probably more like a\nskateboarding style injury, which is, it's unexpected\nin a silly thing. - It's the thing that happens in a second. I didn't break my foot\ndoing anything important. I'd broke my fifth metatarsal\nstepping off a curb. So that's why they're called accidents. You know, if you get hurt\ndoing something awesome, that's a trophy that you\nhave to work through. It's part of your payment to the universe. If you get hurt stepping off a curb or you know, doing something stupid, it's called a stupid accident."

      "text": "- Since we brought up Chimp Empire, let me ask you about relationships. I think we've talked about relationships. - Yeah, I only date Homo sapiens. - Homo sapiens. (chuckles) - [Andrew] It's the morning meditation. - The night is still young. You are human. No, but you are also an animal. Don't sell yourself short. - No, I always say listen, any discussion on the Human Lab podcast about sexual health or anything, I always, the critical force, consensual,\nage appropriate context, appropriate, species appropriate. - Species appropriate. Well, can I just tell you\nabout sexual selection? I've been watching \"Life in\nColor\" with David Attenborough. I've been watching a lot\nof nature documentaries, talking about inner peace,\nit brings me so much peace to watch nature at its\nworst and at its best. So Life in Color is the\nseries on Netflix where it presents some of the most\ncolorful animals on earth and kinda tells their\nstory of how they got there through natural selection. So, you know, you have the\npeacock with the feathers and it's just such incredible colors. Like the peacock has these\ntail feathers, the male, that are like gigantic and\nthey're super colorful. And there're these eyes on it, it's not eyes, it's like eye-like areas. And they wiggle their ass\nlike to show the tails. They wiggle the tails.\n- The eye spots, they're called.\n- The eye spots. Yes, thank you. You know this probably way better than me. I'm just quoting it from David Attenborough.\n- No, please continue. - But it's just, I'm watching this and then the female is as\nboring-looking as po... Like she has no colors or nothing, but she's standing there bored, just seeing this entire display. And I'm just wondering like\nthe entirety of life on earth or not the entirety, post bacteria, is like at least in part, maybe in large part can be\ndescribed through this process of natural selection, of sexual selection. So dudes fighting and then women selecting, it seems like it's just\nthe entirety of that series shows some incredible birds\nand insects, and shrimp. They're all beautiful and colorful and just-\n- Mantis shrimp. - Mantis shrimp, they're\njust, they're incredible. And it's all about getting laid. It's fascinating, like I just... And there's nothing like\nwatching that and Chimp Empire to make you realize, we\nhumans, that's the same thing. That's all we're doing. And all the beautiful\nvariety, all the bridges and the buildings, and the\nrockets, and the internet, all of that is this kind,\nis at least in part, this kind of a product of\nthis kind of showing off for each other and all the wars and all of this, anyway, it's not what I'm asking,\noh, relationships. - Well, right before you\nask about relationships, I think what's clear\nis that every species, it seems, animal species\nwants to make more of itself and protect its young. - Well, to protect its\nyoung is non-obvious. - So not destroy enough of\nitself that it can't get more to reproductive competent age. I mean, I think that, you know, we have a natural, I mean, healthy people\nhave a natural reflex to protect children. - Well, I don't know that.\n- And those, that can't- - Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait minute. I've seen enough animals\nthat are murdering the children of some other- - Sure, there's even\nsiblicide there're like, first of all, I just wanna say that I was delighted in your delight\naround animal kingdom stuff 'cause this is a favorite\ntheme of mine as well. But there's for instance,\nsome fascinating data on, for instance, for those\nthat grew up on farms, they'll be familiar with freemartins, you know about freemartins? This is, they're cows that have\nmultiple calves inside them. And there's a situation\nin which the calves will secrete if there's\nmore than one inside will secrete chemicals that\nwill hormonally castrate the calf next to them,\nso they can't reproduce. So already in the womb they are fighting for future resources. That's how early this stuff can start. So it's chemical warfare in\nthe womb against the siblings. Sometimes there's outright\nsiblicide, siblings are born, they kill one another. This also becomes biblical stories, right? There are instances of cuttlefish, beautiful cephalopods like octopuses. And that is the plural as we made it clear-\n- Yeah, it's a meme on the internet.\n- Oh yeah? That became a meme our little discussion two years ago?\n- Yeah, it spread pretty quick. And now we just resurfaced it. (Andrew laughing) - Creating the dismay in\nyour voice is so amusing. In any event, that male cuttlefish\nwill disguise themselves as female cuttlefish infiltrate\nthe female cuttlefish group and then mate with them, you know? All sorts of, you know, types of covert operations.\n- There we go. - [Andrew] So I think that- (chuckles) - Callbacks.\n- It's like a drinking game where every time we say covert\ncontract in this episode, you have to take a shot of espresso. Please don't do that,\nyou'd be dead by the end. - So actually it's just a small tangent, it does make me wonder how much intelligence\ncovert contracts require. It seems like not much. If you can do it in the animal kingdom, there's some kind of instinctual, it is based perhaps in like fear. - Yeah, it could be simple algorithm. If you know, if there's some ambiguity about numbers and I'm not\nwith these guys and you know, then flip to the alternate strategy. Actually, I have a story about this that I think is relevant. I used to have cuttlefish\nin my lab in San Diego. We went and got them from\na guy out in the desert. We put them in the lab, it was amazing. And they had a postdoc who was studying pre-capturing cuttlefish, they have a very ballistic, extremely rapid strike\nand grab of the shrimp. And we were using high-speed cameras to characterize all this\nlooking at binocular. They normally have their eyes\non the side of their head when they see something they want to eat the eyes translocate to the front, which allows 'em stereopsis,\ndepth perception, allows 'em to strike. We were doing some\nunilateral eye removals, they would miss, et cetera. Okay, this has to do with eye spots. This was during a\ngovernment shutdown period where the ghost shrimp\nthat they normally feed on, that we would ship in\nfrom the gulf down here, weren't available to us. So we had to get different shrimp. And what we noticed was\nthe cuttlefish normally would just sneak up on the shrimp. We learned this by data collection. And if the shrimp was facing them, they would do this thing\nwith their tentacles of kind of enchanting the shrimp, and if the shrimp wasn't facing\nthem, they wouldn't do it and they would ballistically\ngrab it and eat them. Well, when we got these new shrimp, the new shrimp had eye\nspots on their tails. And then the cuttlefish\nwould do this kind of attempt to enchant regardless of the\nposition of the ghost shrimp. So what does that mean? Okay, well, it means that\nthere's some sort of algorithm in the cuttlefish's mind that says, okay, if you see two spots, move your tentacles. So it can be, as you pointed out, it can be a fairly simple operation, but it looks diabolical. It looks cunning, but\nall it is, is strategy B. - Yeah, but it's still somehow emerged. I mean, I don't think that\ncalling it an algorithm doesn't, I feel like-\n- Well, there's a circuit there that gets implemented\nin a certain context, but that circuit had to evolve. - You do realize a super intelligent AI will look at us humans and\nwe'll say the exact thing. There's a circuit in there that evolved to do this algorithm A and algorithm B. And it's trivial. And to us humans, it's fancy and beautiful and write poetry about it, but it's just surreal.\n- Because so we don't understand the subconscious because they want that\nAI algorithm cannot see into what it can't see. It doesn't understand the under workings of what allows all of this\nconversation stuff to manifest. And we can't even see it. How could AI see it? Maybe it will, maybe AI will solve and give us access to our subconscious. Maybe your AI friend or coach, like I think Andreessen and others are arguing it's gonna happen\nat some point it's gonna say, Hey, you know, Lex, you're making decisions lately\nthat are not good for you, but it's because of this algorithm that you picked up in childhood that if you don't state\nyour explicit needs upfront, you're not gonna get what\nyou want, so why do it? From now on, you need\nto actually make a list of every, absolutely, outrageous thing that you want no matter how outrageous and communicate that immediately. And that will work. - We're talking about\ncuttlefish and sexual selection, and then we went into\nsome, where do we go? And you said you were excited. - Well, I was excited where you were just saying what\nabout these covert contracts and animals do them, I think\nis simple contextual engagement of a neural circuit, which\nis not just nerd speak for saying they do a different strategy. It's saying that there\nhas to be a circuit there, hardwired circuit, maybe learned, but probably hardwired\nthat can be engaged, right? You can't build neural\nmachinery out of, in a moment, you need to build that circuit over time. What is building it over\ntime? You select for it. The cuttlefish that did not have that alternate context-driven circuit, didn't survive when there was a, when all the shrimp that they\nnormally disappear in the, the eye-spotted shrimp showed up and there were a couple\nthat had some miswiring, this is why mutation, right? X-Men type stuff is real. They had a mutation that\nhad some alternate wiring and that wiring got selected for, it became a mutation that was adaptive as opposed to maladaptive. This is something people\ndon't often understand about genetics is that it only takes a few\ngenerations to devolve a trait, make it worse, but it takes a long time to\nevolve an adaptive trait. There are exceptions to that, but most often that's true. So a species needs a lot of generations. We are hopefully, still\nevolving as a species and it takes a long time, but to evolve more adaptive traits. But doesn't take long to\ndevolve adaptive traits so that you're getting sicker or you're not functioning as well. So choose your mate wisely. And that's perhaps a good\nsegue into sexual selection of humans.\n- I could tell you're good at this. (Andrew chuckling)"

      "section": "Relationships",
      "text": "We said why did I bring\nup sexual selection? It's relationships, so\nsexual selection in humans. I don't think you've done\nan episode on relationships. - No, I did an episode on attachment, but not on relationships. The series with Conti includes\none episode of the four that's all about relational understanding and how to select a mate based\non matching of drives and- - All the demons inside the subconscious? How to match demons that they\ndance well together or what? - And how generative two people are. - [Lex] What does that mean? - Means that how, the\nway he explains it is, how devoted to creating\ngrowth within the context of the family, the relationship with work. - Well, lemme ask you about mating rituals and how to find such a relationship? I mean, you're really big on friendships, on the value of friendships. - I am. - And that I think extends itself into one of the deepest kinds of\nfriendships you can have, which is a romantic relationship. What mistakes, successes and wisdom can you impart? - Well, I've certainly made some mistakes. I've also made some good\nchoices in this realm. First of all, we have to define what sort of relationship\nwe're talking about. If one is looking for a life partner, you know, potentially somebody\nto establish family with, with or without kids, with\nor without pets, right? Families can take different forms. I mean, I certainly\nexperienced being a family in a prior relationship\nwhere it was the two of us and our two dogs. And it was like, it was family. Like we had a little family. I think based on my\nexperience and based on input from friends who themselves have very successful relationships. I must say, I've got friends\nwho are in long-term, monogamous, very happy relationships where there seems to be a lot\nof love, a lot of laughter, a lot of challenge and a lot of growth. And both people it seems\nreally want to be there and enjoy being there. - Just to pause on that, one thing to do, I think, by way of advice is listen to people who are in long-term successful relationships. That's like, it seems dumb, but like we both know and\nare friends with Joe Rogan, who's been in a long-term,\nreally great relationship and he's been an inspiration to me. So you take advice from that guy? - Definitely. And several members of my podcast team are in excellent relationships. I think one of the things\nthat rings true over and over again in the advice\nand in my experience is, you know, find someone\nwho's really a great friend. Like build a really great\nfriendship with that person. Now, obviously, not just a friend if we're talking romantic relationship, but, and of course,\nsex is super important, but it should be a part of\nthat particular relationship alongside or meshed with the friendship. Can it be a majority of\nthe positive exchange? I suppose it could, but I think the friendship\npiece is extremely important because what's required in a\nsuccessful relationship clearly is joy in being together. Trust, a desire to share experience both, you know, mundane and more\nadventurous, support each other, acceptance, a real, maybe even admiration, but certainly delight in\nbeing with the person. You know, earlier we\nwere talking about peace, and I think that that sense\nof peace comes from knowing that the person you're in friendship with or that you're in romantic\nrelationship or ideally both 'cause let's assume healthy relation, the best romantic relationship includes a friendship component with that person. It's like you just really\ndelight in their presence, even if it's a quiet presence and you delight in seeing\nthem delight in things, right? That's clear. The trust piece is huge, you know, and that's where people start, you know, we don't wanna\nfocus on what works, not what doesn't work, but that's where I think people start engaging these covert contracts. They're afraid of being\nbetrayed, so they betray. They're afraid of giving\nup too much vulnerability so they hide their vulnerability\nor in the worst cases, they feign vulnerability. Again, that's a covert contract that just simply undermines everything, it becomes one, both one equals\ntwo minus one to infinity. Conversely, I think if people can have really hard conversations, this is something I've\nhad to work really hard on in recent years that I'm\nstill working hard on, but the friendship piece\nseems to be the thing that rises to the top\nwhen I talk to friends who are in these great relationships. It's like they have so\nmuch respect and love, and joy in being with their friend. It's the person that they wanna spend as much of their non-working, non-platonic friendship time with and the person they want\nto experience things with, and share things with. And it sounds so kinda\ncanned and cliche nowadays, but I think if you step back\nand examine how most people go about finding a\nrelationship, sort of like, oh, like am I attracted, of\ncourse, physical attraction is important and other\nforms of attraction too, and they sort of enter\nthrough that portal, which makes sense. That's the mating dance, right? That's the peacock situation. That's hopefully not the\ncuttlefish situation where the, (chuckles) but I think that there seems to be a\nhistory of people close to me getting into great relationships where they were friends for a while first or maybe didn't sleep together right away. That they actually\nintentionally deferred on that. This has not been my\nhabit or my experience, you know, I've gone the\nmore I think typical like, oh, there's an\nattraction like this person, there's an interest, you\nkinda explore all dimensions of relationship really quickly, except perhaps the moving in\npart and the having kids part, which ideally because it's a bigger step, harder to undo without\nmore severe consequences. But I think, the whole take it slow thing, I don't think is about getting\nto know someone slowly. I think it's about that physical piece because that does change the\nnature of the relationship. And I think it's because it gets right into the more hardwired\nprimitive circuitry around our feelings of\nsafety, vulnerability, you know, there's something about romantic and sexual interactions\nwhere it's almost like, it's like assets and liabilities, right? Where people are trying to figure out how much to engage their\ntime and their energy, in multiple people, I'm\ntalking about from both sides, you know, male, female\nor whatever it sides, but where it's like\nassets and liabilities, and that's where it starts getting into those complicated\ncontracts early on, I think. And so maybe that's why if\na really great friendship and admiration is established first, even if people are romantically\nand sexually attracted to one another, then that\npiece can be added in a little bit later in a way that really kinda just seals\nup the whole thing. And then who knows, maybe they spend 90% of their\ntime having sex, I don't know, that's not for me to say\nor decide, obviously. But there's something\nthere about staying out of a certain amount of risk of having to engage covert contract in order to protect oneself. - But I do think like, love at first sight, this\nkind of idea is in part realizing very quickly\nthat you are great friends. Like I've had that experience\nof friendship recently. It's not really friendship, but like, oh, you get\neach other, with humans, not in a romantic setting. - Right, friendship.\n- Yeah, just friendship, but not-\n- Well, but dare I say, I felt that way about you when we met, right?\n- But we also- - I was like, this dude's cool and he's smart, and he's\nfunny, and he's driven, and he's giving, and he's\ngot an edge, and like, I wanna learn from him,\nwanna hang out with him. Like, I mean, that was the\nbeginning of our friendship was essentially, you know, that set of internal realizations. - Just keep going, just keep going. Keep going with compliments.\n- And a sharp dresser. - Yeah, yeah, it just looks great. Shirtless on a horseback, yes. - No, no, no. Listen, I mean, despite\nwhat some people might see on the internet, it's a\npurely platonic friendship. - Somebody said, somebody\nasked if Andrew Huberman has a girlfriend, and\nsomebody says, I think so. And the third comment was, this really like breaks my heart, like that Lex and Andrew are not an item. - We are not, we are great\nfriends, but we are not an item. Yeah, it's true, it's official. I hear over and over again from friends that have made great choices\nand awesome partners, and have these fantastic relationships for long periods of time that\nseem to continue to thrive. At least that's what they tell me, and that's what I observed. Establish the friendship first and give it a bit of time before sex. And so, you know, I\nthink that's the feeling. That's the feeling. And these are, we're\ntalking micro-features and macro-features. We're talking, you know, and this isn't about perfection, it's actually about the imperfections, which is kind of cool. I like quirky people, I like characters. I'll tell you where I've gone badly wrong and where I see other\npeople going badly wrong. If there is no rule that says\nthat you have to be attracted to all attractive people, by any means, it's very\nimportant to develop a sense of taste in romantic attractions. I believe what you really like\nin terms of a certain style, you know, a certain way of being, and of course, that includes\nsexuality and sex itself, the verb. But I think it also includes\nthere's just general way of being, you know? And when you really adore somebody, you like the way they answer the phone. And when they don't\nanswer the phone that way, you know, something's\noff and you wanna know. And so I think that the more you can tune-up\nyour powers of observation, not looking for things that you like, and the more that stuff\njust kinda washes over you, the more likely you are to,\nquote-unquote, \"fall in love.\" As a mutual friend of ours said to me, \"You know, listen, when it\ncomes to romantic relationships, if it's not a hundred percent\nin you, it ain't happening.\" And I've never seen a\nviolation of that statement where it's like, yeah, it's mostly good and\nthey're this and this, like the negotiations. Well, already, it's doomed. And that doesn't mean\nsomeone has to be perfect. The relationship has to be perfect, but it's gotta feel a\nhundred percent inside. Like, yes, yes, and yes. I think Deisseroth, when he\nwas on here, your podcast, mentioned something that, you know, like, I think the words were you, or maybe it was in his\nbook, I don't recall. But that, you know, love\nis one of these things that we story into with somebody. We create this idea of\nourselves in the future and we look at our past time together and then you, you story into it. I mean, there are very\nfew things like that, I can't story into, you\nknow, building flying cars. I have to actually go do something. I mean, and love is also\nretroactively constructed. I mean, anyone who's\ngone through a breakup understands the grief of knowing, oh, like this is something\nI really shouldn't be in, for whatever reason, 'cause it only takes one. If the other person\ndoesn't want to be in it, then you shouldn't be in it. But then missing so many things, and that's just the attachment\nmachinery really at work."

      "text": "- I have to ask you a\nquestion that somebody on our amazing team wanted to ask. He's happily married, another like you mentioned\nincredible relationship. - Are they good friends? - They're amazing friends.\n- There you go. - But I'm not saying who it\nis, so I can say some stuff, which is they, it started out\nas a great sexual connection. - Oh, well there you go. - But then became very\nclose friends after that. - Okay, listening-\n- There you go. - So speaking of sex-\n- Many paths to Rome. - He has a wonderful son and he is wanting to have a second kid, and he wanted to ask the\ngreat Andrew Huberman, is there like sexual\npositions or any kinda thing that can help maximize the chance that they have a girl versus a boy? 'Cause they had a wonderful\nboy, they want a girl. Is there a way to control the gender? - Well, this has been\ndebated for a long time and I did a four and a half\nhour episode on fertility. And the reason I did a four\nand a half hour episode on fertility is that, first of all, I find it that reproductive\nbiology be fascinating. And I wanted a resource for people that were thinking about or\nstruggling with having kids for whatever reason. And it felt important to me to combine the male and female components\nin the same episode. It's all timestamped, so you don't have to\nlisten to the whole thing. We talk about IVF, in vitro fertilization and we talk about natural pregnancy. Okay, the data on position\nis very interesting. But let me just say a few things. There are a few clinics now in particular, some out of the United States\nthat are spinning down sperm and finding that they can\nseparate out fractions as they're called, you know, that can spin the sperm\ndown at a given speed and they'll separate out at different sort of depths within the test tube that allow them to pull\nout the sperm on top or below and bias the probability towards male or female births. It's not perfect. It's not a hundred percent. It's a very costly procedure. It's still very controversial. Now with in vitro fertilization, you can extract eggs, you can\ndo introduce a sperm directly by pipette and it's a process called ICSI or you can set up a sperm race in a dish. And if you get a number\nof different embryos, meaning the eggs get\nfertilized to duplicate and start form a blastocyst,\nwhich is a ball of cells, early embryo, then you can do karyotyping. So you can do, look for\nXX or XY, select the XY, which then would give\nrise to a male offspring and implant that one. So there is that kind of sex selection. With respect to position,\nthere's a lot of lore that, you know, if the woman is on top or the woman's on the bottom, or whether or not the\npenetration is from behind, whether or not it's gonna\nbe male or female offspring. And frankly, the data are\nnot great as you can imagine 'cause those would be interesting\nstudies to run, perhaps. - But there is studies, there is papers. - [Andrew] There are some- - But they're not, I guess. there's more lore than sciences. - And there are a lot of other variables that are hard to control. So for instance, if it's\nejaculation during intermission, during sex penetration, et cetera, then you can't measure, for instance, sperm volume as opposed to when it's IVF, and they can actually\nmeasure how many milliliters, how many forward motile\nsperm, it's hard to control for certain things. And it just can vary between individuals and even from one ejaculation to the next. And, okay, so there's too many variables. However, the position thing is interesting in the following way. And then I'll answer\nwhether or not you can bias towards a female. But as long as we're talking about sexual- - [Lex] I have other questions about sexual-\n- But as long as we're talking about sexual position. There are data that support the idea that in order to increase the probability of successful fertilization, that indeed the woman should\nnot stand upright after sex and should right after the\nman has ejaculated inside her and should adjust her pelvis,\nsay 15 degrees upwards. I mean, you know, some\nof the fertility experts, MDs will say, that's crazy, you know, but others that I sought out, and not specifically for this answer, but for researching\nthat episode, said that, yeah, you know what? You're talking about is trying to get the\nmaximum number of sperm and it's contained in semen and\nyes, the semen can leak out. And so keeping the pelvis\ntilted for about at 15 degrees for about 15 minutes, obviously, tilted in the direction that would have things running\nupstream, not downstream, so to speak.\n- Yeah, gravity. - Gravity, it's real, you know, so for maximizing fertilization, you know, the doctors\nI spoke to just said, look, given that if people\nare trying to get pregnant, what is spending 15 minutes on their back, you know, this sort of thing. Okay, so then with\nrespect to female getting a female offspring or XX,\nfemale offspring, selectively, there is the idea that\nas fathers get older, they're more likely to have\ndaughters as opposed to sons. That's a, from the papers I've\nread is a significant, but still mildly significant result. So with each passing year, this person increases the probability they're gonna have a daughter, not a son. But look, so that's interesting. - But the probability differences\nare probably tiny as you- - I mean, it's not, you\nknow, it's not trivial, it's not a trivial difference. But if they want to\nensure having a daughter, then they should do IVF\nand select an XX embryo. And when you go through IVF, they genetically screen\nthem for karyotype, which is XX, XY. And they look at mutations, genotypic mutations for things like, you know, trisomies and aneuploidies, all the stuff you don't want. - But there is a lot of lore if you look on the internet.\n- Sure, different foods- - [Lex] So there are a lot of variables- - There's a lot of variable, but there haven't been systematic studies. So I think probably the best thing to do, unless they're gonna do\nIVF is just, you know, roll the dice and you know, and I think with each\npassing year they increase the probability of getting\na female offspring, but of course, with each passing year, the egg and sperm quality degrade, so, you know, get after it soon. - So I went down a rabbit hole. There's like sexology,\nthere's journals on sex. - Sure. - Okay, so-\n- And some of them, some of them, not all quite reputable. And some of them really\npioneering in the sense that they've taken on topics that are, you know, considered, you know, outside the main\nframe of what people talk about, but they're very important. We have episodes coming out\nsoon with, for instance, the head of male urology, sexual health and reproductive health at\nStanford, Michael Eisenberg, but also, you know, one with a female\nurologist, sexual health, reproductive health, Dr. Rena Malik, who is on, has a quite\nactive YouTube presence. She does these really like dry, like scientific\npresentation, but very nice. She has a lovely voice and she, but she'll be talking about, you know, erections or squirting, or like all this, like she does like very kind\nof internet type content, but she's a legitimate urologist, reproductive health expert. And in the podcast, we did talk about both male and female orgasm. We talked a lot about sexual\nfunction, dysfunction. We talked a lot about pelvic floor. One interesting factoid is that only three, only 3% of\nsexual dysfunction is hormonal endocrine in nature. It's more often related\nto some pelvic floor or vasculature blood flow\nrelated, or other issue. And then when Eisenberg,\nhe came on the podcast, he said that far less sexual dysfunction is psychogenic in origin than people believe that far\nmore of it is pelvic floor, neuro and vascular. So, you know, there are the myths of, I mean, it's not saying that psychogenic\ndysfunction doesn't exist, but that a lot of sexual\ndysfunction that people assume is related to hormones or that is related to psychogenic issues\nare related to vascular or neural issues. And the good news is that there are great remedies for those. And so both those episodes detail some of the more salient points\naround what those remedies are and could be, I mean, one of\nthe kind of, again, factoids, but it was interesting that, you know, a lot of people have pelvic floor issues and they think that their pelvic floors are quote-unquote, \"messed up.\" So they go on the internet, they learn about Kegels, you know, and it turns out that\nsome people need Kegels, they need to strengthen their\npelvic floor, guess what? A huge number of people with\nsexual and urologic dysfunction have pelvic floors that are too tight and Kegels are gonna make them far worse. And they actually need to learn\nto relax their pelvic floor. And so seeing a pelvic floor\nspecialist is important. I think in the next 5, 10 years, we're gonna see a dramatic\nshift towards more discussion about sexual and reproductive health in a way that acknowledges that, yeah, the clitoris comes\nfrom the same origin tissue as the penis. And in many ways, the neural\ninnervation of the two, while clearly different, has\nsome overlapping features that you know, that there's\ngonna be discussion around kind of anatomy and\nhormones, and pelvic floors, and in a way that's gonna, you know, erode some of the kind of\nlike cloaking of these topics 'cause they've been\ncloaked for a long time and there's a lot of like, well, let's just call it what it is, there's a lot of bullshit\nout there about what's what. And now the hormonal issues, by the way, just to clarify, can impact desire. So a lot of people who have lack of desire as opposed to lack of anatomical function, this could be male or female, that can originate with\neither things like SSRIs, or hormonal issues. And so we talk about that as well. So it's a pretty vast topic."

      "section": "Productivity",
      "text": "- Okay, you're one of the\nmost productive people I know. What's the secret to your productivity? How do you maximize the number\nof productive hours in a day? You're a scientist, you're a teacher, you're a very prolific educator. - Well, thanks for the kind words. I struggle like everybody else, but I am pretty relentless about meeting deadlines. I miss them sometimes, but sometimes that means cramming. Sometimes that means starting early, but- - Has that been hard, sorry to\ninterrupt, with the podcast, there's certain episodes, I mean, you're like taking just\nincredibly difficult topics and you know, there're going to be, there's going to be a lot\nof really good scientists listening to those with a very\nskeptical and careful eye. Like how hard, do you struggle meeting\nthat deadline sometimes? - Yes, so we've pushed out episodes because I want more time with them. I also, I haven't advertised this, but I have another fully tenured professor that's started checking my podcasts and helping me find papers. He's a close friend of mine, he's an incredible\nexpert in neuroplasticity and that's been helpful. But I research all my all, I\ndo all the primary research for the episodes myself. Although, my niece has been\ndoing a summer internship with me and finding amazing papers. She did last summer as well,\nshe's really good at it. Just seek that kid on the\ninternet and she gets great stuff. - Can I ask you just\ngoing on tangents here, what's the hardest, finding the papers or understanding what a paper is saying? - Finding the best papers. 'Cause you have to, you know,\nread a bunch of reviews, figure out who's getting cited. Call people in a field, make\nsure that this is the stuff. I mean, you know, I did\nthis episode recently on ketamine, about ketamine. I wasn't on ketamine and you know, there's this whole debate\nabout S versus R Ketamine and S/R Ketamine. And I called two clinical\nexperts at Stanford. I had a researcher at UCLA help me. Even then, you know, a few\npeople had gripes about it, that I don't think they\nunderstood a section that I was perhaps could\nhave been clearer about. But yeah, you're always\nconcerned that people either won't get it or I won't be clear. So the researching is mainly\nabout finding the best papers, and then I'm looking for\npapers that establish a thoroughness of understanding that are interesting, obviously, it's fun to get occasionally\nlook at some of the odder or more progressive\npapers that are, you know, what's new in a field and then where there are actionable takeaways to really export those with\na lot of thoughtfulness. I mean, I think that going\nback to the productivity thing, you know, I do, I get\nup, I look at the sun. I don't stare at the sun,\nbut I get my sunshine. It all starts with a\nreally good night's sleep. I think that's really\nimportant to understand. So much so that if I wake up\nand I don't feel rested enough, I'll often do a non-sleep\ndeep rest, yoga nidra, or go back to sleep for\na little bit, get up, really prioritize one, you know, the big block of work for the\nthing that I'm researching. I think a little bit of anxiety\nand a little bit of concern about deadline helps. Turning the phone off helps. Realizing that those peak hours, whenever they are for you, you do not allow those hours to be invaded unless there's a, you know,\na nuclear bomb goes off. And a nuclear bomb is just a,\nyou know, a phraseology for, you know, it could be family\ncrisis, would be, you know, would be good justification if there's an emergency, obviously. But it's all about focus. It's all about focus in the moment. It's not even so much about\nhow many hours you log. It's really about focus in the moment. How much total focus can\nyou give to something? And then I like to take\nwalks and think about things and sometimes talk about\nthem in my voice recorder. So I'm just always churning\non it all the time. And then of course, learning to turn it off and\nengage with people socially and, you know, not be\npodcasting 24 hours a day in your head is key. But I think I love\nlearning and researching, and finding that those\npapers and the information, and I love teaching it. And these days I use a\nwhiteboard before I start. I don't have any notes, no teleprompter. Then the whiteboard that I used beforehand is to really sculpt out the\ndifferent elements and the flow, get the flow right,\nand move things around. The whiteboard is such a valuable tool. Then take a couple pictures of\nthat when I'm happy with it, put it down on the desk and\nthese are just bullet points and then just churn through,\nand just churn through. And nothing feels better than, you know, researching\nand sharing information. And as you did, you know,\ngrew up writing papers and it's hard. And I like the friction of a, (grunts) can't, you know, I wanna get\nup, wanna use the bathroom. When I was in college, I was trying to make up deficiencies from my lack of attendance in high school. So much so that I would set a timer. I wouldn't let myself get up\nto use the bathroom, even. Never had an accident, but I was, you know, I mean, it was like, I listened\nto music, classical music, Rancid, a few other things. Some Bob Dylan maybe thrown in there and just study and just... And it felt, and then, you know, hit the two-hour mark and you're in pain, and then you get up,\nlike use the bathroom. Like, that felt so good. There's something about the human brain that likes these kind of friction points and working through them and you just have to work through them. So yeah, I'm productive and my life has arranged\naround it and you know, that's been a bit of a barrier\nto personal life at times, but my life's been arranged around it. I've set up everything so that\nI can learn more, teach more, including, you know, some of my home life. But I do, you know,\nstill watch Chimp Empire. Still got time to watch Chimp Empire. Look, the great Joe Strummer, right, Clash or my favorite Mescaleros, he said, this is a famous Strummer\nquote, \"no input, no output.\" So you need experience, you\nneed outside things in order to foster the process. But yeah, just noses the\ngrindstone man, I don't know. And that's what I'm\nhappy to do with my life. I don't think anyone should\ndo that, just because, but this is how I'm showing up. And, you know, if you\ndon't like me, then scroll. Why do they say swipe left, swipe right? I don't know. I'm not on the apps, the dating apps. So that's the other thing\nI keep waiting for when listens to Lex Fridman\npodcast is a check box on like Hinge or Bumble,\nor whatever it is. But I don't even know are\nthose that are field is, I don't know what are the apps now? - Well, I've never used an app, those foul troublesome\nhow little information is provided on apps. - Well, they're the ones\nthat are like a stocked lake. Like Raya, you know? They sort of like, companies\nwill actually fill them with, you know?\n- Oh, interesting. - People that look a certain way and- - Well, soon it'll be filled with AI. - Oh yeah. - That's the way you said, oh. - Oh, that's interesting.\n- A heartbreak within that. - Well, you know, I'm guilty of liking real human interaction. - Have you tried AI interaction? (Lex and Andrew chuckling) - No, but I have a feeling\nyou're gonna convince me to. (Lex and Andrew chuckling) - One day. Yeah, I've also struggled\nfinishing projects that are new, that are something new. Like for example, one of the things I\nreally struggled finishing is something that's in Russian\nthat requires translation and overdub, and all that kind of stuff. The other project I've\nbeen working on for like, over at least a year, off and on, but trying to finish is something we've talked\nabout in the past is, I'm still on it project on\nHitler and World War II. I've written so much about it and I just don't know\nwhy I can't finish it. I have trouble, like really... I think I'm terrified being\nin front of the camera. - Like this? - Like this.\n- Or solo? - Well, actually, no, no, no. Solo, basically.\n- Well, if you wanna do solo and seriously, 'cause we've\ndone this before, right? Our clandestine study missions. I'm happy to sit in the\ncorner and work on my book or do something if you\nwanna, if it feels good- - Just for the feeling of somebody else. - Definitely.\n- What do you, I mean, how do you... You don't seem to, you seem to have been fearless, to just sit in front of\nthe camera by yourself to do the episode. - Yeah, it was weird. I mean, the first year of the podcast, it just spilled outta me. It was just, I had all that\nstuff I was so excited about. I've been talking to\neveryone and who would listen and anyone even when, who they'd run away, I'd keep talking, you know, before there was ever a\ncamera wasn't on social media. In 2019, I posted a little\nbit, 2020, as you know, I started going on podcasts. But yeah, I just... The zest and delight in this stuff. I was like, circadian rhythms, I'm gonna tell you about this stuff. Just felt like, here's the opportunity and just let it burst. And then as we've gotten into topics that are a little bit further\naway from my home knowledge, you know, like I still get\nsuper excited about it. It's music in the brain\nepisode I've been researching for a while now, I'm just so hyped, I keep thinking about it. It's so interesting. There's so many facets. Singing versus improvisational,\nexcuse me, music versus I'm listening to\nmusic versus learning music. I mean that, it just goes on and on. There's just so much,\nthat's so interesting. I just can't get enough and I think, I dunno, you put a camera in front of me, I sort of forget about it and\nI'm just trying to just teach. - Yeah, so that's the\ndifference, that's interesting. I mean-\n- Forget the camera. - Maybe I need to find that joy as well, but like for me, a lot of\nthe joys in the writing, and the camera, there's something- - Well, the best lecturers, as you know, and you're in a phenomenal lecturer, so you embody this as well. But when I teach at Stanford, I was directing this\ncourse in neuroanatomy and neuroscience for medical students. And I noticed that the best\nlecturers would come in and they're teaching the material from a place of deep understanding, but they're also experiencing\nit as a first-time learner as at the same time. So it's just sort of\nembodying the delight of it, but also the authority\nover the, not authority, but the sort of mastery of the material. And it's really the delight in it that the students are linking onto it. And of course, they need and deserve the best accurate material, so they have to know what\nthey're talking about. But yeah, just tap into\nthat energy of learning and loving it, and people\nare long for the ride. Or you know, I get accused\nof being long-winded, but, you know, things\nget taken outta context that leads to greater misunderstanding. And also I look at, listen, I come from a lineage\nof three dead advisors, three, all three. So I don't know when the\nreaper's coming for me. I'm doing my best to\nstay alive a long time. But whether or not it's a\nbullet or a bus, or cancer, whatever, or just old age, I mean, I'm trying to get it all\nout there as best I can. And if it means you have to hit pause and come back a day or two later, like, that seems like a\nreasonable compromise to me. I'm not gonna go longer than I need to and I'm trying to shorten them up. But again, that's kinda how I show up. It's like Tim Armstrong would\nsay about writing songs. I asked him, do you write,\nhow often do you write? Every day? Every day. Has Rick ever stopped creating? No. Has Joe ever stopped preparing for comedy? Are you ever stopping to\nthink about world issues and technology and who you can talk to? I mean, it seems to me\nyou've always got a plan, the insight. The thing I love about\nyour podcast the most, to be honest these days, is the surprise of like, I don't know who\nthe hell's gonna be there. It's almost like, I get a\nlittle nervously excited about when a new episode\ncomes 'cause I have no idea. No idea. And you know, I mean, I have some guesses based on what you told\nme during the break. I mean, you've got some\npeople where it's just like, whoa! Lex has went there? Awesome. Can't wait, click. You know, I think that's really cool. Like, you're constantly surprising people. So you're doing it so well. Like, it's such a high-level. And I think it's also important\nfor people to understand that what you're doing, Lex,\nthere's no precedent for it. Sure, there have been interviews before, there have been podcasts before. There are discussions before, but it's not like, how many\nof your peers can you look to, to find out how best to\ndo the content like yours? Zero. There's one peer, you. And so, you know, that\nshould give you great peace and great excitement because you're a pioneer. You're literally the tip of the spear. I don't wanna take an unnecessary tangent, but I think this might thread together two of the things that we've been\ntalking about, which are, I think of pretty key importance. One is romantic relationships, and the other is creative\nprocess and the work. And this again, is something\nI learned from Rick, but that he and I have\ngone back and forth on. And that I think is worth\nelaborating on, which is, earlier we were saying, you know, the best\nrelationship is gonna be one where it brings you peace. I think peace also can be\ntranslated to, among other things, lack of distraction. So when you're with your partner, can you really focus on\nthem and the relationship? Can you not be distracted by things that you're upset about from their past or from your past with them or their, and of course, the same\nis true for them, right? They ideally will feel\nthat way towards you too, they can really focus. Also, when you're not with them, can you focus on your work? Can you not be worried about\nwhether or not they're okay? 'Cause you trust that they're an adult and they can handle things\nor they will reach out if they need things? They're gonna communicate\ntheir needs like an adult, you know, not creating\nmessage just to get attention and things like that. Or disappearing, you\nknow, for that matter. So peace and focus are intimately related, and distraction is the\nenemy of peace and focus. So there's something there, I believe, because with people that have\nthe strong generative drive and want to, you know, be productive in their\nhome life in the sense have a rich family life or\npartner life, whatever that is. And in their work life, you know, the ability to\nreally drop into the work and like, okay, you might\nhave that sense like, I hope they're okay or, you know, need to check my phone or something. But just know like, we're good. So peace and focus, I think\nbeing present are so key. And it's key at every level\nof romantic relationship from, you know, certainly presence\nand focus, you know, everything from sex to listening to, you know, raising a family, to tending to the house and in work, it's absolutely critical. So I think that those things\nare kind of mirror images of the same thing. And they're both important\nreflections of the other. And when you start to\njust, you know, when work is not going well, then the\nfocus on relationship can suffer and vice versa. - And it's crazy how important that is. How incredibly wonderful\nit could be to have a person in your life that kind of enables that creative focus. - Yeah, and you supply the peace and focus for their endeavors,\nwhatever those might be. I mean that symmetry there, because clearly, people\nhave different needs and the need to just really trust, you know, like when Lex is working, he's in his generative\nmode and I know he's good. And so then they feel sure\nthey've contributed to that, but then also what you're\ndoing is supporting them in whatever way it happens to be. And I think that sometimes\nyou'll see that people will pair up along creative,\ncreative or musical, musical, or computer scientists. But I think, again, going\nback to this Conti episode on relationships is that\nthe superficial labels are less important it\nseems than just the desire to create that kind of home\nlife and relationship together. And as a consequence, the work mode. And for some people they're\nboth people aren't working. And sometimes they are. But I think that's the\ngood stuff, you know? And I think that's the\nbig learning in all of it, is that the further along\nI go with each birthday, I guarantee you're gonna be like, what I want is simpler and simpler, and harder and harder to\ncreate, but oh, so worth it."

      "text": "- The inner and the outer peace. It's been over two years, I think since Costello passed away. - [Andrew] It still tears me up. - You mentioned him still.\n- I cried about him today, I cried about him today.\n- Still? - It's proportional to the love. But yeah, I'll cry about it\nright now if I think about it. It wasn't putting him down, it wasn't the act of\nhim dying any of that. Actually, that was a beautiful experience. I didn't expect it to be, but it was in my place when\nI was living in Topanga during the pandemic where\nwe launched the podcast and I did it at home. And he hated the vets, I did it at home. And it was, he gave out\nthis huge (deep sigh) right at the end. And I could just tell he had been in just not a lot pain, fortunately, but he had just been working\nso hard just to move at all. And the craziest thing happened,\nLex is, was unbelievable. I've never had an experience like this. I expected my heart to break. And I've felt a broken heart before. I felt it, frankly, when my parents split, I felt it when Harry shot himself. I felt it when Barbara died and felt it, when, you know,\nwhen Ben went, so as well. And so many friends, like\nway too many friends. I mean, the end of 2017,\nmy friend Aaron King, Johnny Farer, John Eckelberry, stomach cancer, suicide, fentanyl. It's like, whoa! All in a freaking week. And I just remember\nthinking like, what the? But when Cost... And it's just heartbreaking,\nyou just carry that. And it's like, (grunts) and that's just a short list, you know? And I don't say that for sob story, it's just for a guy that\nwasn't in the military or didn't grow up in the inner city, like it's an unusual\nnumber of like deaths, like close people. When Costello went, the\ncraziest thing happened. My heart warmed up, like heated up. And I wasn't on MDMA and\njust the moment he went, it just went whoosh! And I was like, what the hell is this? And it was just like a\nsupernatural experience to me. I just never had that. I put my grandfather on the ground, I was a pallbearer at the funeral. I've like done that more times than I'd like to have ever done it. And it just heated up with\nCostello and I thought, what the fuck is this? And it was almost like, and\nwe make up these stories about what it is, but it was almost like\nhe was like, all right, I have to be careful 'cause I will cry here\nand I don't want to. It was almost like, he\nwas like, all that effort 'cause I had been putting\nso much effort into him, it was like, alright, you get that back. It was like the giant freaking thank you. And it was incredible, you know? And I'm not embarrassed to\nshed a tear or two about it if I have to, I was like, holy shit! Like that's how close\nI was to that animal. - Where do you think, where do you think you can\nfind that kind of love again? - Man, I don't know. I mean, when, and excuse\nme for welling up, but it was just, I mean,\nit's a freaking dog, right? I get it. But for me, it was the\nfirst real home I ever had. But when Costello went, it was like, we had had this home in Topanga. We had set it up and we're like, and he was just so happy there. And I think it just... I don't know, it was like this weird like victory slash massive loss. Like we did it 11 years. Freaking did everything to make him as comfortable as possible. And he was super loyal, beautiful animal, but also just funny and fun. And I was like, I did it. Like, you know, I gave as much of myself\nto this being as a human. I felt I could without\nmaking it, you know, like, you know, detracting\nfrom the rest of my life. And so I don't know, when I think about Barbara especially, I well up and it's hard for me, but I mean, I talked\nto her before she died and that was a brutal conversation. Saying goodbye to someone, especially with kids. And that was hard. I think that really flipped a\nswitch in me where I'm like, I always knew I wanted kids. I'd say I want kids, I want a lot of kids. That flipped a switch in me. I was like, I want kids. I want my own kids. - [Lex] You might be able\nto find that kind of love. - Yeah, I think because\nit was the caretaking, it wasn't about what he\ngave me all that time. And the more I could take\ncare of him and see him happy, the better I felt, it's crazy. And, I don't know. So I miss him every day, every day. I miss him every day. - You got a heart that's so full of love. I can't wait for you to have kids. - Thanks man.\n- For you to be a father. - Yeah, well, - I can't wait to say-\n- when I'm ready for it. When, you know, when God decides\nI'm ready, I'll have 'em. - And then I will still beat you to it. As I told you many times before. - I think you should absolutely have kids. I mean, look at the people in our life 'cause we're kind of the... In case you haven't realized it already, like we're the younger of the podcasters, but you know, like Joe\nand Peter, and Segura, and you know, and the rest, right? They're like the tribal elders, right? And we're, you know, we're not the the youngest in the crew, but if you look at all those\nguys, they all have kids. They all adore their kids and their kids bring tremendous\nmeaning to their life. Like we'd be morons if, you know, if you didn't\ngo off and start a family, I didn't start a family. And yeah, I think that's the goal. I mean, I think- - The kids.\n- of the goals, that's one of them. - Kids not only make them\ntheir life more joyful and brings love to their life, it's also makes 'em more productive, makes 'em better people, all that. It's kind of obvious. - Yeah, I think that's\nwhat Costello wanted. I think I have this story in\nmy head that he was just like, okay, like take this. Like you could, yeah. - And don't fuck this up. - And don't, (chuckles) Lord knows, don't fuck this up. - Andrew, I love you brother. This is incredible.\n- Love you too, thank you, I appreciate you. - As we will talk often\non each other's podcast for many years to come. - Yes.\n- Many, many years to come. - Thank you, thanks for having me on here. And there are no words\nfor how much I appreciate your example and your\nfriendship, so love you brother. - I love you too. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Andrew Huberman. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now lemme leave you with\nsome words from Albert Camu. \"In the midst of winter, I found there was, within\nme, an invincible summer. And that makes me happy.

  "full_text": "- Listen, when it comes\nto romantic relationships, if it's not a hundred percent in you, it ain't happening. And I've never seen a violation of that statement where it's like, yeah, it's\nmostly good and they're this, and this is like the negotiations. Well, already you're, it's doomed. And that doesn't mean\nsomeone has to be perfect, the relationship has to be perfect. But it's gotta feel a\nhundred percent inside. Like, yes, yes, and yes. - The following is a\nconversation with my dear friend, Andrew Huberman, his fourth\ntime on this podcast. It's my birthday. So this is a special\nbirthday episode of sorts. Andrew flew down to Austin just\nto wish me a happy birthday, and we decided to do\na podcast last second. We literally talked for hours beforehand and a long time after,\nlate into the night. He's one of my favorite human\nbeings, brilliant scientist, incredible teacher, and a loyal friend. I'm grateful for Andrew. I'm grateful for good friends, for all the support and love I've gotten over the past few years. I'm truly grateful for this life. For the years, the days, the minutes, the seconds I've gotten to live on this beautiful earth of ours. I really don't want to leave just yet. I think I'd really like to stick around. I love you all. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" And now, dear friends,\nhere's Andrew Huberman. - I'm trying to run a little bit more. - Are you losing weight? - I'm not trying to lose weight, but I always do the same fitness routine after like 30 years, basically, lift three days a week,\nrun three days a week. But one of the runs is a long\nrun, one of 'em is medium, one of 'em is a sprint-type thing. So what I've decided to do\nthis year was just extend the duration for the long run. And I like being a mobile. I never wanna be so\nheavy that I can't move. Like I wanna be able to go out and run 10 miles if I have to. So sometimes I do. And I wanna be able to\nsprint if I have to. So sometimes I do. And lifting an objects, feels good. It feels good to train like a lazy bear and just lift heavy objects. But I've also started\ntraining with lighter weights and higher repetitions, and for three month cycles, and it gives your joints a rest. And yeah, so probably, you know, I think it also is interesting to see how training differently\nchanges your cognition. That's probably hormone-related, you know, that hormones\ndownstream of training heavy versus hormones downstream of\ntraining a little bit lighter. I think my cognition is better\nwhen I'm doing more cardio and when the repetition ranges\nare a little bit higher, which is not to say that\npeople who lift heavy are dumb, but there is a... 'cause there's real\nvalue in lifting heavy. - There's a lot of angry\npeople listening to this right now.\n- No, no, no. But lifting heavy and then\ntaking 3 to 5 minutes rest is far and away a different challenge than running hard for 90 minutes. That's a tough thing. Just like getting in an\nice bath, people say, \"Oh, well, how is that any\ndifferent than working out?\" Well, there are a lot of differences, but one of 'em is that\nit's very acute stress, within one second you're stressed. So I think subjecting the body to a bunch of different types of\nstressors in space and time is really valuable. So yeah, I've been\nplaying with the variables in a pre-systematic way. - Well, I like long and slow for, like you said, the\nimpact it has on my cognition. - Yeah, the wordlessness of it, the way it puts you in a, the way it seems to clean out the clutter. You know, it can take away that hyperfocus and put you more in a\nrelaxed focus, for sure. - Well, for me, it brings the clutter to the surface at first. Like, all these thoughts come in there and then they dissipate. You know, I've been, because I got knee barred pretty hard, that's when somebody\ntries to break your knee, you know?\n- That's Jiu-jitsu. They try and break your knee? Oh, so you tap, so they... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's, you know, hyperextend the knee at that direction, they got\nknee barred pretty hard. So in ways I don't understand,\nit kinda hurts to run. I don't understand what's\nhappening behind there. I need to investigate this. It basically, this, the hamstringing flex, like curling your leg hurts a little bit. And that results in this weird, dull, but sometimes extremely sharp\npain in the back of the knee. So I'm working through this, anyway, but walking doesn't hurt. So I've been playing around\nwith walking recently, like for two hours and thinking- - I love that.\n- because I know a lot of like smart\npeople throughout history. I have walked and thought,\nand you have to like, you know, play with things\nthat have worked for others. Not just to exercise, but to like integrate this very light kind of prolonged exercise\ninto a productive life. So they do all their\nthinking while they walk. It's like a meditative type of walking. And it's really interesting. It really works. - Yeah, the practice I've been\ndoing a lot more of lately is I walk while reading a book, in the yard, I'll just pace back and forth or walk in a circle. - [Lex] Audiobook or are you talking about-\n- No, hard copy. - [Lex] Well, you're just holding- - I'm holding the book and\nI'm walking and I'm reading. And I usually have a\npen and I'm underlining, I have this whole system, like underlining stars,\nexclamation points, goes back to university of\nwhat things I'll go back to, which things I export to\nnotes and that kind of thing. But from the beginning when\nI opened my lab at that time in San Diego before I\nmoved back to Stanford, I would have meetings with\nmy students or postdocs by just walking in the\nfield behind the lab, you know, and I'd bring\nmy Bulldog, Costello. Bulldog Masttif at the time. And he was a slow walker. So these were slow walks, but I can think much\nmore clearly that way. There's a Nobel Prize winning professor at Columbia University School\nof Medicine, Richard Axel, who won the Nobel Prize, co-won\nNobel Prize with Linda Buck for the discovery of the\nmolecular basis of olfaction. And he walks and voice\ndictates his papers. And now with Rev or these other, maybe there are better ones than Rev, where you can convert audio\nfiles into text very quickly and then edit from there. So I will often voice dictate first drafts and things like that. And I totally agree on the long runs, the walks, the integrating\nthat with cognitive work, harder to do with sprints. And then the gym, you know, are you, you weight train? - Yeah.\n- You just seem naturally strong and like thicker jointed. - (chuckles)\n- It's true, it's true. I mean, we did the one very beginner. 'cause I'm a very beginner\nof jiu-jitsu class together. And yeah, as I mentioned then,\nwhat if people missed it? Lex is freakishly strong. - I think I was born\ngenetically to hug people. - [Andrew] Oh, like Costello. - Yeah, exactly.\n- You guys have a certain similarity. He had wrists, like, you know, it's like you and Jocko and\nCostello have these like wrists and elbows that are super thick, you know, and then when you look around,\nyou see tremendous variation. You know, some people have like\nthe wrist width of a Whippet or Woody Allen, and then\nother people like you or Jocko or, you know? There's this one Jocko video\nor thing on GQ or something. Have you seen the comments on Jocko? These are the best. - [Lex] No. (chuckles) - The comments, I love\nthe comments on YouTube 'cause occasionally they're funny. The best is when Jocko was born, the doctor looked at his\nparents and said, it's a man. (Lex laughs) - [Lex] It's like Chuck\nNorris type comments. - Oh yeah, those are great. That's what I miss about\nRogan being on YouTube with the full length\nepisode, oh, that comment. - So this is technically\na birthday podcast. What do you love most about getting older? - It's like, the confirmation that comes from getting more and more data that which basically says, yeah, the first time\nyou thought that thing, it was actually right because the second, third\nand fourth and fifth time, it turned out the exact same way. In other words, there have\nbeen a few times in my life where I did not feel easy\nabout something I felt a signal from my body, this is not good. And I didn't trust it early on, but I knew it was there. And then two or three\nbad experiences later, I'm able to say, ah, every single time there was a signal from the body informing my mind, \"this is not good.\" Now the reverse has also been true that there've been a number of instances in which I feel there\nsort of immediate delight. And there's this kind\nof almost astonishingly simple experience of feeling\ncomfortable with somebody or at peace with something,\nor delighted at an experience. And it turns out all, literally all of those\nexperiences and people turned out to be experiences and people that are still in my life and that I still delight in every day. In other words, what's\ngreat about getting older is that you stop questioning the signals that come from the, I think, deeper recesses of\nyour nervous system to say, Hey, this is not good, or hey,\nthis is great, more of this. Whereas, I think in my\nteens, my 20s, my 30s, I'm 40, almost 48, I'll be 48 next month. I didn't trust, I didn't listen. I actually put a lot of work\ninto overriding those signals and learning to fight through them, thinking that somehow\nthat was making me tougher or somehow that was making me smarter. When in fact, in the end, those people that you meet that are, you know, difficult or you know, there are other names for\nit, you know, it's like, in the end you're like, that\nperson's a piece of, you know? Or this person is amazing\nand they're really wonderful. And I felt that from go. - So you've learned to trust your gut versus like the influences\nof other people's opinions. - I've learned to trust my gut versus the forebrain over analysis,\noverriding the gut. Other people often in my life\nhave had great optics, right? I've benefited tremendously\nfrom an early age of being in a large community. Well, it's been mostly guys, but I have some close female\nfriends and always have as well who will tell me that\nthat's a bad decision or this person not so good, or be careful, or they're great, or that's great. So oftentimes my community\nand the people around me have been more aligned\nwith the correct choice than not-\n- Christian, really? - Yes\n- Really? When you were younger, like, or like friends, parents and so on? - I don't recall ever really\nlistening to my parents that much, you know, I\ngrew up in a, you know, we don't have to go back\nto my childhood thing, but my sense was that-\n- It's your fault, Andrew. - Thank you, I learned that recently in a psilocybin journey. My first high dose psilocybin journey, which was-\n- Welcome back. - done with a clinician,\nthank you very much. Thank you. I was worried there for\na second at one point, I might not coming back, but in any event, yeah, I\ngrew up with some wild kids. You know, I would say\nabout a third of my friends from childhood are dead or in jail, about a third have gone on to do tremendously impressive things. Start companies, excellent athletes, academics, scientists and clinicians. And then about a third\nare living their lives as kind of more typical. I just mean, that they are\nhappy family people with jobs that they mainly serve the\nfunction to make money. They're not sort of\ncareer into their career for career's sake. But, so some of my friends\nearly on gave me some bad ideas, but most of the time,\nmy bad ideas came from overriding the signals\nthat I knew that my body, and I would say my body and\nbrain were telling me to obey. And now I say body and brain is that there's this brain region, the insula, which does many things, but it represents our\nsense of internal sensation and interoception. And I was talking to\nPaul Conti about this, you know, who as you know,\nI respect tremendously. I think he's one of the\nsmartest people I've ever met, I think for different reasons. He and Marc Andreessen\nare some of the like, smartest people I've ever met. But Paul's level of insight\ninto the human psyche is absolutely astounding. And he says the opposite\nof what most people say about the brain, which is most people say, oh, the supercomputer of\nthe brain is the forebrain. It's like a monkey brain with a extra real estate put on there, and the forebrain is what makes us human and gives us our superpowers. Paul has said, and he's done a whole\nseries on mental health that's coming out from\nour podcast in September. So this is not an attempt to plug that, but he'll elaborate on- - Wait, Paul-\n- what I'm about to say. - [Lex] Wait, you're\ndoing a thing with Paul with the series?\n- We already did. Yeah, so Paul-\n- Oh, nice. - Yeah, so Paul Conti shot, we did, he and I sat down and he\ndid a four episode series on mental health. This is not mental illness, mental health about how to explore\none's own subconscious, explore the self build and\ncultivate the generative drive. You'll learn more about\nwhat that is from him. He's far more eloquent\nand clearer than I am. And he provides essentially a set of steps to explore the self that does not require that\nyou work with a therapist. This is self-exploration\nthat is rooted in psychiatry, it's rooted in neuroscience. And I don't think this\ninformation exists anywhere else. I'm not aware that it\nexists anywhere else. And he essentially distills it all down to one 8 1/2 by 11 sheet,\nwhich we provide for people. And he says there, I don't want to give too much away because I would detract from\nwhat he does so beautifully, but if I tried and I wouldn't\nhave accomplish it anyway. But he said, \"And I believe\nthat the subconscious is the supercomputer of the brain. All the stuff working underneath\nour conscious awareness that's driving our feelings and what we think are the decisions that we've thought through so carefully. And that only by\nexploring the subconscious and understanding it a little bit, can we actually improve\nourselves over time.\" And I agree. I think that, so that the mistake is to think that thinking\ncan override it all. It's a certain style of\nintrospection in thinking that allows us to read\nthe signals from our body, read the signals from our brain, integrate the knowledge that we're\ncollecting about ourselves and to use all that in ways\nthat are really adaptive, and generative for us. - What do you think is\nthere in that subconscious, what do you think of the\nJungian shadow, what's there? - You know, there's this idea,\nas you're familiar with too, I'm sure that this\nJungian idea that there, we all have all things inside of us. That all of us have the\ncapacity to be evil, to be good, et cetera, but that some people\nexpress one or the other to a greater extent. But he also mentioned that\nthere's a unique category of people, maybe 2 to 5% of people that don't just have all\nthings inside of them, but they actually spend\na lot of time exploring a lot of those things. The darker recesses, the\nshadows, their own shadows. You know, I'm somebody who's drawn to goodness and to light, and to joy, and all those things like anybody else. But yeah, I think maybe it\nwas part of how I grew up. Maybe it was the crowd\nI was with, maybe... But then again, you know, even when I started spending\nmore time with academics and scientists, I mean, you see shadows in other ways, right? You see pure ambition with no passion. I recall a colleague in San Diego who, it was very clear to me, did not actually care about\nunderstanding the brain, but understanding the\nbrain was just his avenue to exercise ambition. And if you gave him\nsomething else to work on, he'd work on that, in fact, he did. He left and he worked on something else. I realized he has no passion for understanding the brain, like all, I assumed all scientists do,\ncertainly why I went into it. But some people, it's just raw ambition. It's about winning. It doesn't even matter what they win. It's to which to me is crazy. But I think that's a shadow\nthat some people explore, not one I've explored. I think the shadow parts\nof us are very important to come to understand and look, better to understand them\nand know that they're there and work with them than to not\nacknowledge their presence, and have them surface in the\nform of addictions or behaviors that damage us and other people. - So one of the processes\nfor achieving mental health is to bring those things to the surface. So fish the subconscious mind. - Yes, and you know, Paul describes 10 cupboards\nthat one can look into for exploring the self. There's the structure of self\nand the function of self. Again, this will all be\nspelled out in this series in a lot of detail also in\nterms of its relational aspect between people, how to pick good partners and good relations. It gets really into this from\na very different perspective. Yeah, fascinating stuff. I was just sitting there, just... I will say this, that four\nepisode series with Paul is at least to date,\nthe most important work I've ever been involved\nin, in all of my career. Because it's very clear\nthat we are not taught how to explore our subconscious. And that very few people actually\nunderstand how to do that. Even most psychiatrists, he mentioned something\nabout psychiatrists. You know, if you're a\ncardiothoracic surgeon or something like that and\n50% of your patients die, you're considered a bad\ncardiothoracic surgeon. But with no disrespect to psychiatrists, there are some excellent\npsychiatrists out there. There are also a lot of terrible\npsychiatrists out there. Because unless all of those, all of their patients commit\nsuicide or half commit suicide, they can treat for a long time\nwithout it becoming visible that they're not so good at their craft. Now he's superb at his craft. And I think he would say that,\nyes, exploring some shadows, but also just understanding the self. Like what, you know,\nreally understanding like, who am I and what's important? What are my ambitions? What are my strivings? Again, I'm lifting from some of the things that he'll describe\nexactly how to do this. People do not spend enough time\naddressing those questions. And as a consequence, they discover what resides\nin their subconscious through the sometimes\nbad, hopefully also good, but manifestations of their actions. We are driven by this huge 90% of our real estate that is not visible to our conscious awareness. And we need to understand that, you know, I've talked about this before, I've done therapy twice\na week since I was a kid. I had to, as a condition of\nbeing let back in school, I continue, I found a way\nto either through insurance or even when I didn't have insurance, I took an extra job writing\nfor Thrasher Magazine when I was a postdoc so I could pay for therapy at a discount 'cause I didn't make\nmuch money as a postdoc. I mean, I think for me, it's as important as going to the gym. And people think it's just, oh, you know, ruminating on problems\nor getting, no, no, no. If you work with somebody really good, they're forcing you to ask questions about who you really are,\nwhat you really want. It's not just about support,\nbut there should be support, there should be rapport, but then it's also, there\nshould be insight, right? Most people who get therapy,\nthey're getting support. There's rapport, but insight is not easy to arrive at. And a really good\npsychologist or psychiatrist can help you arrive at deep insights that transform your entire life. - Well, sometimes when I look\ninside, and I do this often, you know, exploring who you truly are, you come to this question, do I accept once you see parts, do I accept this or do I fix this? Is this who you are fundamentally, and it will always be this way? Or is this a problem to be fixed? Like, for example, one of the things, especially recently, but in general over time\nI've discovered about myself probably has roots in childhood, probably has roots in a lot of things, is I deeply value loyalty maybe more than the average person. And so when there's disloyalty,\nit can be painful to me. And so this is who I am, and\nso do I have to relax a bit? Do I have to fix this part?\nOr is this who you are? And there's a million,\nthat's one like little... - I think loyalty is a\ngood thing to cling to, provided that when loyalty is broken, that it doesn't disrupt too\nmany other areas of your life. But it spends also on who's\ndisrupting that loyalty, if it's a coworker\nversus a romantic partner versus your exclusive romantic partner, depending on the structure of your romantic partner life, you know, I mean, I have always experienced extreme joy and feelings of safety, and trust in my friendships. Again, mostly male friendships, but female friendships\ntoo, which is only to say that they were mostly male friendships. The female friendships\nhave also been very loyal. You know, so getting backstabbed is not something I'm familiar with. And yeah, I love being crude up, you know? - Yeah, yeah, no, for\nsure and I'm with you, and you know, you and I are very much have the same values on this, but you know, that's one little thing. And then there's many other things, like I'm extremely self-critical. Then you look at my, you know, I look at myself as, I'm\nregularly very self-critical, there's a self-critical\nengine in my brain. And I talked to actually Paul about this, I think on the podcast quite a bit. And he's saying, this\nis a really bad thing. Like, you need to fix this. You need to be able to be\nregularly very positive about yourself. And I kept disagreeing with him. No, this is like who I am. And he seems to work, don't mess with a thing that\nseems to be working, it's fine. Like I oscillate between\nbeing really grateful and really self-critical. But then you have to like\nfigure out what is it, maybe there's a deeper root thing. Maybe there's an insecurity\nin there somewhere that has to do with childhood and then you're trying to\nprove something to somebody from your childhood, this kind of thing. - Well, a couple things that\nI think are hopefully valuable for people here. One is one way to destroy your life is to spend time trying to control your or somebody else's past. So much of our destructive behavior and thinking comes from wanting something that we saw or did, or\nheard to not be true, rather than really working\nwith that and getting close to what it really was. And you know, sometimes those\nthings are even traumatic and we need to really get close to them and for them to move through us. And that, you know, there\nare a bunch of different ways to do that with support\nfrom others and hopefully, but sometimes on our own as well. I don't think we can\nrewire our deep preferences and what we find despicable or joyful. I do think that it's really a question\nof what allows us peace. Like, can you be at peace with the fact that you're very self-critical and enjoy that, get some distance from it, have a sense of humor about it or is it driving you in a way that's keeping you awake at night and forcing you back to the\ntable to do work in a way that feels self-flagellating\nand doesn't feel good. You know, can you get that\nhumility and awareness of how you're, you know,\nof your one's flaws? And I think that can create, you know, this word space sounds very new agey, like get space from it. It's, you know, you can\nhave a sense of humor about how, you know,\nneurotic, we can all be, I mean, you know, neurotic isn't actually a bad term in the classic\nsense of the psychologists and psychiatrists, the freudians. So that, you know, the best\ncase is to be neurotic, to actually see one's own\nissues and work with them. Whereas psychotic is the other way to be, which is obviously not good. So I think the question whether\nor not to work on something or to just accept it as part of ourselves, I think really depends if we feel like it's\nholding us back or not. And I think you're asking perhaps\nthe most profound question about being a human, which is, you know, what do you do with your body? What do you do with your mind? I mean, it's also a question. We started off talking\nabout fitness a little bit. We just, for whatever reason, you know, do I need to\nrun an ultra marathon? I don't feel like I need to. David Goggins does, and does\na whole lot more than that. So that for him, that's important. For me, it's not important to do that. I don't think he does it just\nso he can run the ultras. There's clearly something\nelse in there for him. And guys like Cam Hanes and tremendous respect for what\nthey do and how they do it. Does one need to make their\nbody more muscular, stronger, more endurance, more flexibility? Do you need to read harder books? Do you need to, I think\ndoing hard things feels good. I think it, I know it feels good. I know that the worst I feel, the worst way to feel is\nwhen I'm procrastinating and I don't do something. And then whenever I do\nsomething and I complete it, and I break through that\npoint where it was hard and then I'm doing it, at the end, I actually\nfeel like I was infused with some sort of super chemical. And who knows if it's probably a cocktail of endogenously made chemicals. But I think it is good to do hard things, but you have to be careful\nnot to destroy your body, your mind in the process. And I think it's about whether\nor not you can achieve peace. Can you sleep well at night? Stress isn't bad if you\ncan sleep well at night. You can be stressed all day,\ngo, go, go, go, go, go, go, and it'll optimize your focus. But can you fall asleep and\nstay deeply asleep at night? Being in a hard relationship. Some people say, you\nknow, that's not good. Other people like it. Can you be at peace in that? And I think we all, you know, have different RPM that, you know, we all kinda idle at different RPM and some people are big mellow Costellos, and others are kind of like, you know, need more friction in\norder to feel at peace. But I think ultimately what\nwe want is to feel at peace. - Yeah, I've been through\nsome really low points over the past couple years and I think the reason could be boiled down to the fact that I\nhaven't been able to find a place of peace, a place or people, or moments\nthat give deep inner peace. Yeah, you know, and I think you put it really beautifully. You have to figure out, given who you are, the various characteristics\nof your mind, all the things, all the contents of the cupboards, how to get space from it. And ultimately, one good\nrepresentation of that is to be able to laugh at all of it. Whatever's going on inside your mind to be able to step back\nand just kinda chuckle at the beauty and the\nabsurdity of the whole thing. - Yeah, and keep going. There's this beautiful, as I mentioned, it seems like every podcast lately, I'm a huge Rancid fan, mostly 'cause I just think\nTim Armstrong's writing is pure poetry and whether or\nnot you like the music or not, you know, and he's written music for a lot of other people too. He's not, doesn't advertise that much 'cause he's humble, but- - [Lex] And that by the way,\nI went to a show of theirs like 20 years ago.\n- Oh yeah? I'm gonna see them in\nBoston, September 18th. I'm literally flying there for, or I'll take the train up from New York. I'm gonna meet a friend of\nmine named Jim Thiebaud, who's a big guy who\nowns a lot of companies, the skateboard industry. We're meeting there like\na couple little kids to go see them play. Amazing people, amazing music. - Very intense.\n- Very intense, but embodies all the different emotions. That's why I love it, right? They have some love songs,\nthey have some hate songs, they have some, but you know, going back to what you said,\nI think there's a song, the first song on the\nIndestructible album, I think there's a, it's sort of, he's just\ntalking about like shock and disbelief of discovering\nthings about people that were close to you, and, you know, I won't sing it, but, you know, nor I wouldn't dare. But there's this one lyric\nwhere that's really stuck in my mind for ever since\nthat album came out in 2003, which is, you know, that\nnothing's what it seems, so I just sit here laughing,\nI'm gonna keep going on. I can't get distracted. There is this piece of like,\nyou gotta learn how to push out the disturbing stuff\nsometimes and go forward. And I mean, I remember hearing that lyric and then writing it down and, you know, that was a time where my\nundergraduate advisor, who was like a mentor and a father to me, you know, blew his head off in the bathtub like three weeks before. And then my graduate advisor, who I was working for at that\ntime, who I loved and adored, was really like a mother to me. I knew her when she was\npregnant with her two kids died at 50, breast cancer. And then my postdoc advisor,\nyou know, first day of work at Stanford as a faculty\nmember sitting across the table like this from him, had a heart\nattack right in front of me, died of pancreatic cancer\nat the end of 2017. And I remember just thinking like, you know, going back to that\nsong lyric over and over, like, and where people would, you know, I haven't had many betrayals in life. I've had a few, but just thinking like, or seeing something or learning something about something you just,\nlike, you can't believe it. And I mentioned that\nlyric off that first song, Indestructible on that album because it's this like, just\nthe raw emotion of like, I can't believe this, what\nI just saw is so disturbing, but I have to just keep going forward. There are certain things that\nwe really do need to push, not just into our periphery, but often to the gutter and keep going. And that's a hard thing\nto learn how to do. But if you're going to be\nfunctional in life, you have to. And actually just to get at\nthis issue of do I change or do I embrace this aspect of self? About six months, it was April of this last year, I did some intense work around some things that were\nreally challenging to me. And I did it alone, and it may have involved some medicine. And I expected to get peace through this. I was like, I'm gonna let go of it, and I spent 11 hours just\ngetting more and more frustrated and angry about this thing\nthat I was trying to resolve. And I was so unbelievably disappointed that I couldn't get that relief. And I was like, what is this? Like this is not how\nthis is supposed to work. I'm supposed to be feel peace. The clouds are supposed to lift. And so a week went by and then another half week went by, and then someone whose\nopinion I trust very much, I explained this to them because I was getting a\nlittle concerned like, what's going on? This\nis worse, not better. And they said, \"This is very simple. You have a giant blind spot, which is your sense of justice, Andrew, and your sense of anger are linked like an iron rod and\nyou need to relax it.\" And as they said that, I\nfelt the anger dissipate. And so there was something\nthat I think is, it is true. I have a very strong sense of\njustice and my sense of anger then at least, was very\nstrongly linked to it. So it's great to have a\nsense of justice, right? I hate to see people wronged. I absolutely do. And I'm human, I'm sure I've\nwronged people in my life. I know I have, they've told me, I've tried to apologize and\nreconcile where possible, still have a lot of work to do. But where I see injustice, it draws in my sense of anger in a way that I think is just eating me up. And, but it was only in hearing that link that I wasn't aware of before, it was in my subconscious, obviously. Did I feel the relaxation? It wasn't, there's no\namount of plant medicine or MDMA or any kind of, you know, chemical you can take that's naturally just going to dissipate\nwhat's hard for oneself. It needs, if one embraces that or if one chooses to do it\nthrough just talk therapy or journaling, or\nfriends, or introspection, or all of the above, there needs to be an\nawareness of the things that we're just not aware of. So I think the answer to your question, do you embrace or do you fight\nthese aspects of self is, I think you get in your subconscious through good work with\nsomebody skilled or, and sometimes that involves\nthe tools I just mentioned in various combinations,\nand you figure it out. You figure out if it's serving you. Obviously, it was not bringing me peace. It was undermining my sense of justice, was undermining my sense of peace. And so in understanding this link be... Now, I would say that the, in understanding this link\nbetween justice and anger, now, I think it's a\nlittle bit more of like a, you know, it's not like\na Twizzler stick bendy, but it's at least, it's\nnot like an iron rod. Like, you know, when I\nsee somebody wronged, I mean, it used to just like,\n(puffs) like immediately. - But you're able to step\nback now that's like to me, the ultimate place to reach is laughter. - I just sit here laughing. Exactly, that's the lyric,\nI like, I can't believe it. So I just sit here laughing like, can't get distracted. Just you at some point, but the problem I think in\njust laughing at something, like that gives you distance. But the question is, do you stop engaging\nwith it at that point? Like, I experienced this, I mean, recently, I got\nto see how sometimes I'll see something that's just like, what? Like this is crazy so I just laugh, but then I continue to engage in it and it's taking me off course. And so there is a place where, you know, I mean, I realize\nthis is probably a kid show too, so I want to keep it, you know, G-rated, but at some point for certain things, it makes sense to go, fuck that. - But also laugh at yourself\nfor saying fuck that. - Yeah, and then move on. So the question is, do you get stuck or do you move on, right? - Sure, but like, there's\na lightness of being that comes with laughter. I mean, I've gotten...\n- Sure. - Like, as you know, I spent\nthe day with Elon today. He just gave me this burnt hair. Do you know what this is? - [Andrew] I have no idea. - I'm sure there's actually, there should be a Huberman\nlab episode on this. It's a cologne that's burnt hair. - I see.\n- And it's like supposedly a really intense smell. And it is.\n- Give me a smell. - [Lex] Do please, it's not gonna leave your nose.\n- That's okay. Well, that's okay, I'll take a gent... I'll whiff it as if I were whiffing a chemical in the lab.\n- You have to actually spray it on yourself. 'cause I don't know if you can- - So I'm reading an amazing book called \"An Immense World\" by Ed Yong. He won a Pulitzer for\n\"We Contain Multitudes\" or something like that, I think is the title of the other book. And the first chapter\nis all about olfaction and the incredible power\nthat olfaction has. That smells terrible. I don't even-\n- And it doesn't leave you. For those listening, it doesn't quite smell terrible. It's just intense and it stays with you. This to me represents like just laughing at\nthe absurdity of it all. - So I have to ask, so you\nwere rolling jiu-jitsu? - [Lex] Yeah, we're\ntraining jiu-jitsu, yeah. - So is that fight between Elon and Zuck actually gonna happen? - I think Elon is a huge\nbeliever of this idea of the most entertaining\noutcomes is the most likely. And he almost like,\nthere's almost the sense that there's not a free\nwill and the universe has a kinda deterministic\ngravitational field pulling towards the most fun and he's\njust a player in that game. So from that perspective, I think it seems like something\nlike that is inevitable. - Like a little scrap in the parking lot of a Facebook or something like that.\n- Exactly. - Sorry, Meta.\n- Yeah. - But it looks like\nthey're training for real, and Zuck has competed right in jiu-jitsu? - So I think he is\napproaching it as a sport. Elon is approaching it as a spectacle. And I mean, the way he talks about it, he's a huge fan of history. He talks about all the\nwarriors that have fought throughout history. If you look, he wants to\nreally do it at the Colosseum. And you know, the\nColosseum is for 400 years, there's so many, so much\ngreat writing about this. I think over 400,000 people have died in the Colosseum, Gladiators. So this is this historic place\nthat sheds so much blood, so much fear, so much anticipation\nof battle, all of this. So he loves this kinda spectacle. And also, the meme of it, the hilarious absurdity of it, that two tech CEOs battling it out on sand in a place where gladiators\nfought to the death and then bears and lion ate prisoners as part of the execution process. - Well, it's also gonna be an instance where Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk gets to change bodily fluids. If they bleed, there's one\nthing's about fighting, you know? I think it was in that book, it's a great book \"Fighter's Heart,\" where he talks about, you\nknow, the sort of the intimacy of sparring. I only rolled jiu-jitsu with you once, but there was a period\nof time where I boxed and which I don't recommend. I got hit, I hit some guys\nand definitely got hit back. I'd spar on Wednesday nights\nwhen I lived on San Diego. And you know, when you spar with somebody, even if they hurt you,\nespecially if they hurt you, you know, you see that person afterwards and there's an intimacy, right? It was in that book \"Fire's\nHeart\" where he explains, you know, you're exchanging bodily fluids with a stranger, right? And you're in your primitive mind, and so there's an intimacy\nthere that persists, so. - You go together through a\nprocess of fear, anxiety, like- - Yeah, when they get you, you nod. I mean, you watch somebody like\ncatch somebody if, you know, not so much in professional fighting, but if people are sparring\nthat they catch you, you acknowledge that they caught you, like you got me there. - And on the flip side of that, so we trained and then after\nthat we played Diablo IV. - [Andrew] I don't know what that is. I don't play video games, sorry. - But it's a video game. So it's like, it's a, you know, pretty intense combat in the video. You know, you're fighting like demons and- - Oh, okay. The last video game I played\nwas Mike Tyson's \"Punch Out.\" - [Lex] There, you go. That's pretty close.\n- I met him recently, went on his podcast. - [Lex] You went, wait... - It hasn't come out yet.\n- Oh, it hasn't come out yet, okay.\n- Yeah. Yeah, I asked Mike, his kids are great. They came in and they're super smart kids. Goodness gracious. They ask great questions. I asked Mike what he did with\nthe piece of a Evander's ear that he bit off and said-\n- Did he remember? - He's like, gave it\nback to him. (chuckles) - [Lex] There you go, sorry about that. - He sells edibles that\nare in the shape of ears with a little bite out of it. Yeah, his life has been incredible. He's intimate. Yeah, his family are, you get the sense that\nthey're really a great family. They're really...\n- Mike Tyson? That's a heck of a journey\nright there of a man. - Yeah, my now friend, Tim Armstrong, like I said, lead singer\nfrom Rancid, he put it best. He said, you know, that\nMike Tyson's life is, you know, Shakespearean and you know, down, up, down, up. And just that the arcs\nof his life are just like sort of an only in America\nkinda tale too, right? - So, speaking of Shakespeare, I've recently gotten to know Neri Oxman, who's this incredible scientist that works at the intersection\nof nature and engineering. And she reminded me of\nthis Anna Akhmatova line, this is this great Soviet\npoet that I really love from over a century ago that, \"Each of our lives is a\nShakespearean drama raised to the thousand degree.\" So I have to ask, why do you think humans are attracted to this kind of Shakespearean drama? Is there some aspect\nwe've been talking about the subconscious mind that\npulls us towards the drama, even though the place of\nmental health is peace? - Yes, and yes. - Do you have some of that? - Draw towards drama? Yeah. - [Lex] If you look at the empirical data. - Yes, I mean... Right, if I look at the empirical data, I mean, I think about\nwho I chose to work for as an undergraduate, right? I was, you know, barely\nfinished high school, finally get to college, barely. I think... This is really embarrassing\nand not something to aspire to, you know, I was, you know,\nthrown outta the dorms for fighting, barely passed\nmy classes, you know, the girlfriend and I split up. I mean, I was living in a\nsquad, got into a big fight. I was getting in trouble with the law. Eventually got my act\ntogether, go back to school, start working for somebody, who do I choose to work for? A guy who's an ex-navy\nguy who smokes cigarettes in the fume hood, drinks coffee, and we're injecting rats with MDMA. And, you know, I was drawn\nto like the personality, his energy, but also, he\nwas a great scientist. Worked out a lot on a thermal regulation in the brain and more, you know, go to graduate\nschool, I'm working for somebody and decide that yeah, doing,\nworking in her laboratory wasn't quite right for me. So I'm literally sneaking\ninto the laboratory next door and working for the woman next door because I liked the\nrelationships that she had to a certain set of questions. And she was a kind of a quirky person. And, you know, so drawn to drama, but drawn to, I like characters. I like people that have texture. And I'm not drawn to raw ambition. I'm drawn to people that\nseem to have a real passion for what they do and a uniqueness to them that I, you know, you\ncan kind of, not kind of, I'll just say how it is. I can feel their heart for what they do. And I'm drawn to that, like... And that can be good. The same reason I went to work\nfor Ben Barres as a postdoc, it wasn't because he was\nthe first transgender member of the National Academy of Sciences. That was just a feature of who he was. I loved how he loved Glia. He would talk about these cells like they were the most enchanting things that he'd ever seen in his life. And I was like, this is like\nthe biggest nerd I've ever met, and I love him. I think I'm drawn to that. This is another thing that\nConti makes elaborates on quite a bit more in the series on\nmental health coming out. But there are different drives within us. There are aggressive drives,\nnot always for fighting, but for intense interaction. I mean, look at Twitter, look at people clearly\nhave an aggressive drive. There's also a pleasure drive. Some people also have a\nstrong pleasure drive. They want to experience\npleasure through food, through sex, through friendship, through adventure, you know? But I think the Shakespearean\ndrama is the drama of the different drives\nin different ratios in different people. I know somebody and she's incredibly kind, has an extremely high pleasure drive, loves taking great care of\nherself and people around her through food and through retreats, and through all these things, and makes spaces beautiful\neverywhere she goes. And gifts, these things that are just so unbelievably\nfeminine and incredible. These gifts to people and\nthe kind and thoughtful about what they like. And then, but I would say\nvery little aggressive drive from my read. And then I know other people\nwho are just have a ton of aggressive drive and\nvery little pressure drive. And I think, so there's this alchemy that exists where people have these things in different ratios,\nand then you blend in, you know, the differences\nin the chromosomes and differences in hormones, and differences in personal history, and what you end up with is a species that creates incredible recipes of drama, but also peace, also relief\nfrom drama, contentment. I mean, I realize this\nisn't the exact topic of the question, but someone I know very dearly, actually an ex-girlfriend of\nmine, long-term partner of mine sent me something recently\nand I think it hit the nail on the head, which is\nthat ideally for a man, they eventually settle where\nthey find and feel peace. Where they feel peaceful, where they can be themselves\nand feel peaceful. Now, I'm sure there's a equivalent or mirror image of that for women, but this particular post\nthat she sent was about men. And I totally agree. And so it isn't always that\nwe're seeking friction, but for periods of our life,\nwe seek friction, drama, adventure, excitement, fights, you know, and doing hard, hard things. And then I think at some point, I'm certainly coming to this\npoint now where it's like, yeah, that's all great and\nchecked a lot of boxes, but had a lot of close calls, flew really close to the sun\non a lot of things with life and limb, and heart and spirit. And some of, you know, people\nclose to us didn't make it. And sometimes not making it means the career they wanted went off a cliff or their health went off a cliff, or their life went off a cliff. But I think that there's\nalso the Shakespearean drama of the characters that exit the play and are living their lives\nhappily in the backdrop. It just doesn't make for\nas much entertainment. - That's one other thing that's a benefit, you could say is the\nbenefit of getting older is finding the Shakespearean\ndrama less appealing or finding the joy in the peace. - Yeah, definitely. I mean, I think that, I think\nthere's real peace with age. I think the other thing is this notion of checking\nboxes is a real thing, for me anyway. I have a morning meditation that I do, well, I wake up now, I get\nmy sunlight, I hydrate, I use the bathroom, I do all\nthe things that I talk about. I've started a practice of\nprayer in the last year, which is new-ish for me, which is, we could talk about it if you want.\n- In the morning? - Yeah.\n- Can you talk about it a little bit?\n- Sure, yeah. And then I have a meditation that I do that actually is where I think through with the different roles that I play. So like, I start very basic. I say, you know, okay, I'm an animal. Like we are like,\nbiologically animals, right? Human, you know, I'm a man,\nI'm a scientist, I'm a teacher, I'm a friend, I'm a brother, I'm a son, you know, I go through\nthis, I have this list and I think about the\ndifferent roles that I have and the roles that I still\nwant in my life going forward that I haven't yet fulfilled. It just takes me, it's\nsort of an inventory of where I've been, where I'm at, and where I'm going as they say. And I don't know why I do it, but I started doing it this last year, I think because it helps me understand just how many different\ncontexts I have to exist in and remind myself that there's still more that I haven't done\nthat I'm excited about. - So within each of those contexts, there's like things that you\nwant to kind of accomplish, to define that. - Yeah, and I'm ambitious so I think, you know, I'm a brother. I have an older sister and\nI love her tremendously. And I think like, I wanna be the best\nbrother I can be to her. Which means maybe a call, maybe just, you know, we do an annual trip\ntogether for our birthdays. Our birthdays are close together. We always go to New York for our birthdays and we've gone for the\nlast three, four years, like really like reminding\nmyself of that role, not because I'll forget, but because I have all these other roles I'll get pulled into. I say the first one, I'm an animal because I have to remember\nthat I have a body that needs care, like any of us. I need sleep, I need food,\nI need hydration, I need... That I'm human, that the brain of a human is marvelously complex, but also marvelously\nself-defeating at times. And so I've been thinking\nabout these things in the context of the different roles. And the whole thing takes\nabout four or five minutes. And I just find it brings me\na certain amount of clarity that then allows me to\nratchet into the day. The prayer piece, yeah, I think I've been\nreluctant to talk about until now because I don't believe in\npushing religion on people. And I think that, and I'm not. It's a highly individual thing. And I do believe that\none can be an atheist and still pray or agnostic and still pray. But for me, it really came\nabout through understanding that there are certain aspects of myself that I just couldn't resolve on my own. And no matter how much therapy, no matter how much, and I\nhaven't done a lot of it, but no matter how much plant medicine or other forms of medicine, or exercise, or podcasting, or science, or friendship, or any of that, I was\njust not going to resolve. And so I started this because someone close to me said, a male friend said, \"You\nknow, prayer is powerful.\" And I said, \"Well, how?\" And he said, \"I don't know\nhow, but if you can get... It can allow you to get outside yourself, let you give up control, and\nat the same time take control.\" I don't even like saying take control. But the whole notion is that, and again, forgive me, but there's no other way to say it. The whole notion is that, you know, like God works through us, whatever God is to you,\nhe, him, her, whatever, life force, like nature,\nwhatever it is to you, right? That it works through us. And so I do a prayer,\nI'll just describe it, where I ask, I make an ask\nto help remove my defects, my character defects. I pray to God to help\nremove my character defects so that I can show up better\nin all the roles of my life and do good work. Like to, which for me is\nlearning and teaching. Learning and teaching. And so you might say,\nwell, how is that different than a meditation? Well, I'm acknowledging\nthat there is something that bigger than me, bigger\nthan nature as I understand it, that I cannot understand or\ncontrol, nor do I want to. And I'm just giving over to that. And does that make me less of a scientist? I sure as hell hope not. I certainly know, there's\nthe head of our neurosciences at Stanford until recently. You should talk to him directly about it. Bill Newsome has talked\nabout his religious life. For me, it's really a way\nof getting outside myself and then understanding how I\nfit into this bigger picture. And the character defects\npart is real, right? I'm a human, I have defects, like I got a lot of flaws\nin me, like anybody. But, and trying to acknowledge them and asking for help in\nremoving them, not magically, but through right action,\nthrough my right action. So I do that every morning. And I have to say that it's\nhelped, it's helped a lot. It's helped me be better to myself, be better at other people. I still make mistakes, but it's becoming a\nbigger part of my life. And I never thought I'd talk like this, but I think it's clear to me that if we don't believe in something, again, doesn't have to be traditional, standardized religion, but if we don't believe in\nsomething bigger than ourselves, we at some level will self-destruct. I really think so. And it's powerful in a way\nthat all the other stuff, meditation, all the tools is not because it's really operating at a much deeper and bigger level. And, you know, yeah, I think that's all I can talk about it, mostly because I'm still working out, you know, the scientists\nin me wants to understand how it works, and I wanna understand. And the point is to just go, you know, there's you know, for lack of a better language for it, there's higher power than\nme and what I can control, I'm giving up control on certain things. And somehow that restores\na sense of agency for right action, better action. - I think perhaps a part of\nthat is just the humility that comes with acknowledging\nthere's something bigger and more powerful than you. - And you can't control everything. I mean, that you go through\nlife as a hard-driving person, you know, forward center of mass. I remember being that\nway since I was little. It's like a new Legos, I'm like, I'm gonna make all the Legos. And it was like on the weekends, you know, learning about medieval weapons and then giving lectures about it in class when I was five or six years old, or learning about tropical fish and, you know, cataloging\nall of them at the store, and then organizing it and making my, you know, my dad drive\nme or my mom drive me to some fish store and then\nspending all my time there until they throw me out,\nyou know, all of that, but I also remember my entire\nlife, I would secretly pray. When things were good\nand things weren't good, but mostly when things were weren't good 'cause it's important to pray, for me, it's important to\npray each morning regardless. But when things weren't right, I couldn't get make sense of\n'em, I would secretly pray, but I felt kind of ashamed\nof that for whatever reason. And then it was once in\ncollege, I distinctly remember, I was having a hard time\nwith a number of things and I took a run down to Sands Beach, it was UC, Santa Barbara. And I remember I just, I was like, I don't know if I even\nhave the right to do this, but I'm just praying and I just prayed for the ability to be as\nbrutally honest with myself and with other people\nas I possibly could be about a particular situation\nI was in at that time. I mean, I think now it's\nprobably safe to say, I'd gone off to college 'cause\nof a high school girlfriend. We had, essentially, she\nwas my family, more frankly, more than my biological family was at a certain stage of life. And we'd reached a point\nwhere we were diverging and it was incredibly painful. It was like losing everything I had. And it was like, what do I do? How do I manage this? Do I, you know, I was ready to quit and join the fire service\njust to support us so that we could move forward. And you know, it was just, but praying, just saying, I can't\nfigure this out on my own. It's sort of like I can't\nfigure this out on my own. And how frustrating that is\nthat no number of friends could tell me, or, and in\nher wisdom couldn't tell me. And eventually, it led\nme to the right answers. And she and I are are\nfriendly friends to this day. She's happily married with a\nchild and we're on good terms, but I think, you know, it's a scary thing, but it's the best thing when you just, I can't control all this. And asking for help, I\nthink is also the piece. You're not asking for some\nmagic hand to come down and take care of it. You're asking for the help\nto come through you, right? So that your body is used\nto do these right works, right action. - Isn't it interesting\nthat this secret thing that you're almost embarrassed by, that you did it as a\nchild is something you, it's another thing you\ndo as you get older, as you realize, like those\nthings are part of you, it's actually a beautiful thing. - Yeah, a lot of the content\nof the podcast is, you know, deep academic content and we\ntalk about everything from, you know, eating disorders\nto bipolar disorders, to depression, you know,\na lot of different topics, but the tools or the\nprotocols as we say, right? The sunlight viewing and all the rest, you know, a lot of that\nstuff is just stuff I wish I'd known when I\nwas in graduate school. If I'd known to go outside\nevery once in a while and get some sunlight,\nnot just stay in the lab, I would've, you know, I might not have hit like a really tough round of depression when I was a postdoc and\nworking twice as hard. And, you know, when my\nbody would break down or I'd get sick a lot, I\ndon't get sick much anymore. Occasionally, about once\nevery 18 months to two years maybe I'll get something, but you know, I used to\nbreak my foot skateboarding all the time, I couldn't\nunderstand what's wrong with my body, I'm getting injured, I can't do what everyone else can. Now I developed more slowly,\nI had a long arc of puberty, but so that was part of\nit, I was still developing, but you know, how to\nget your body stronger, how to build endurance? Like no one told me, the\ninformation wasn't there. So a lot of what I put out\nthere is the information that I wish I had because once I had it, I was like, wow! Like A, this stuff really works. B, it's grounded in something real. You know, sometimes certain protocols are a combination of,\nyou know, animal, human, and animal, and human studies,\nsometimes clinical trials, sometimes there's some\nmechanistic conjecture for some, not all, I\nalways make clear which. But in the end, like figuring out how things\nwork so that we can be happier, healthier, more productive, suffer less, like reduce the suffering of the world. And I think that, well, I'll just say thank you and for asking about the prayer piece. Again, I'm not pushing or\neven encouraging it on anyone, I've just found it to be\ntremendously useful for me. - (sighs) You know, I mean\nabout prayer in general, you said information and\nfiguring out how to get stronger, healthier, smarter, all\nthose kinds of things. A part of me believes\nthat deeply, you know? You can gain a lot of knowledge\nand wisdom through learning. But a part of me believes\nthat all the wisdom I need was there when I was 11 and 12 years old. - And then it got cluttered over. Well, listen, I can't wait for\nyou and Conti to talk again. Because when he gets going\nabout the subconscious and the amount of this\nthat sits below the surface like an iceberg and the\nfact that when we're kids, we're not obscuring a lot of\nthat subconscious as much. And sometimes that can look\na little more primitive. I mean, that kid that's\ndisappointed will let you know, that kid that's excited will let you know. And you feel that raw\nexuberance or that raw dismay. And I think that as we grow older, we learn to cover that stuff up. We wear masks and we have\nto, to be functional, right? I don't think we all wanna go around just being completely raw. But as you said, as you\nget older, you also, you get to this point\nwhere you kind of go, eh, you know, what are we\nreally trying to protect anyway? I mean, I have this theory that, you know, certainly my\nexperience has taught me that a lot of people, but I'll talk about men 'cause that's what I know best. Whether or not they show up strong or not, that they're really afraid of being weak. Like they're just afraid. Like sometimes the strength is even a way to try and not be weak, right? Which is different than being\nstrong for its own sake. I'm not just talking\nabout physical strength, I'm talking about intellectual strength. I'm talking about money. I'm talking about expressing drive. I've been watching this series a little bit of \"Chimp Empire-\" - Oh, yeah. - So Chimp Empire is amazing, right? They have the head chimp,\nhe's not the head chimp, but the alpha in the group. And he's getting older. And so what does he do? Every once in a while he\ngoes on these vigor displays. He goes and he grabs branch. He starts breaking him and\nhe starts thrashing 'em, and he's incredibly strong, and they're all kind like watching. I mean, yeah, I\nimmediately think of people like they're deadlifting on Instagram and I just think, displays a vigor. This is just the primate\nshowing that displays a vigor. Now what's interesting is that\nhe's doing that specifically to say, Hey, I still have what it takes to lead this troop, okay? Then there're the ones that\nare subordinate to him, but not so far behind- - It seems to be that\nthere's a very clear, like numerical ranking. - There is.\n- Like, it's clear who's the number two, number three? - Oh yeah.\n- I mean, probably- - Who gets to mate first? Who gets to eat first? This exists in other animal societies too, but Bob Sapolsky would be a great person to talk about this with 'cause he knows obviously,\ntremendous amount about it. And I know just the top contour, but yeah, so number two,\nthree and four males are aware that he's doing\nthese vigor displays, but they're also aware because in primate evolution they got some extra forebrain\ntoo, not as much as us, but they got some, and they're aware that the\nvigor displays are displays that because they've done them as\nwell in a different context, might not just be displays of vigor, but might also be an insurance policy against people seeing weakness. Okay, so now they start\nusing that prefrontal cortex to do some interesting things. So in primate world, if a male is friendly with\nanother male wants to affiliate with him and say, Hey, I'm backing you, they'll go over and they'll\npick off the little parasites and eat them. And so the grooming is\nextremely important. In fact, if they want to ostracize or kill one of the members of their troop, they will just leave it alone. No one will groom it. And then there's actually a\nreally disturbing sequence in that show of then the parasites start to eat away on their skin. They get infections, they have issues, no one will mate with them, no one, they have other issues as\nwell and can potentially die. So the interesting thing\nis, is number two and three start to line up a\nstrategy to groom this guy, but they are actually\nthinking about overtaking the entire troop, setting in a new alpha. But the current alpha did\nthat to get where he is. So he knows that they're\ndoing this grooming thing, but they might not be\nsincere about the grooming. So what does he do? He takes the whole troop\non a raid to another troop and sees who will fight\nfor him and who won't. This is advanced contracting of behavior for a species that\nnormally we don't think of as sophisticated as us. So it's very interesting\nand it gets to something that I hope we'll have an\nopportunity to talk about 'cause it's something that\nI'm obsessed with lately is this notion of overt versus\ncovert contracts, right? There are overt contracts where\nyou exchange work for money or you exchange any number\nof things in an overt way. But then there are covert contracts. And those take on a very different form and always lead to, in\nmy belief, bad things. - Well, how much of human\nand chimp relationships are overt versus covert? - Well, here's one thing\nthat we know is true. Dogs and humans, the dog to human\nrelationship is 100% overt. They don't manipulate you. Now you could say they do\nin the sense that they learn that if they look a certain\nway or roll on their back, they get food. But there's no banking of that behavior for a future date where then\nthey're going to undermine you and take your position, okay? So in that sense, dogs can\nbe a little bit manipulative in some sense, but. Now, okay, so overt contract would be, we both wanna do some work together. We're gonna make some money. You get X percentage, I get\nX percentage, it's overt. Covert contract, which is,\nin my opinion, always bad would be, we're gonna\ndo some work together. You're gonna get a percentage of money, I'm gonna get a percentage of money, could look just like the overt contract, but secretly, I'm resentful\nthat I got the percentage I got. So what I start doing is\ncovertly taking something else. What do I take? Maybe I take the opportunity\nto jab you verbally every once in a while. Maybe I take the\nopportunity to show up late. Maybe I take the opportunity to get to know one of your coworkers so that I might start\na business with them. That's covert contracting. And you see this sometimes\nin romantic relationships. One person, we won't\nset the male or female in any direction here and just say, I'll make you feel powerful\nif you make me feel desired. Okay, great. There's nothing explicitly\nwrong about that contract if they both know and they both agree, but what if it's, I'll do that, but I'll have kids with\nyou so you feel powerful, you'll have kids with\nme so I feel desired, but secretly, I don't want to do that. Or one person says, I don't wanna do that or both don't, so what they\nend up doing is saying, okay, so I expect something else. I expect you to do certain things for me, or I expect you to pay\nfor certain things for me. Covert contracts are the\nsignature of everything bad. Overt contracts are the\nsignature of all things good. And I think about this a lot because I've seen a lot\nof examples of this. Like anyone, we\nparticipate in these things whether or not we want to or not. And the thing that gets\ntransacted the most is, well, I should say the things that get transacted the most are the overt things. You'll see money, time, sex, property, whatever it\nhappens to be, information. But what ends up happening is that when people I believe don't feel safe, they feel threatened in some way, like they don't feel safe\nin a certain interaction, what they do is they start\ntaking something else while still engaging in the exchange. And I'll tell you, if there's one thing about\nhuman nature that's bad, it's that feature. Why that feature? Or is it a bug, or a feature\nas you engineers like to say, I think it's because we were allocated a certain extra amount\nof prefrontal cortex that makes us more\nsophisticated than a dog, more sophisticated than a\nchimpanzee, but they do it too. And it's because it's often harder to deal with, in the short-term, to deal with the real\nsense of this is scary, this feels threatening than it is to play out all the iterations. It takes a lot of brain work. You're playing chess and\ngo simultaneously try and figure out where\nthings are gonna end up, and we just don't know. So it's a way I think of creating a false sense of certainty, but I'll tell you, covert contracts, the only certainty is\nthat it's gonna end badly. The question is how badly? Conversely, overt\ncontracts always end well. Always, the problem with overt contracts is that you can't be certain\nthat the other person is not engaging in a covert contract. You can only take responsibility\nfor your own contracting. - Well, one of the\nchallenges of being human is looking at another human\nbeing and figuring out the way, their way of\nbeing, their behavior, which of the two types of\ncontracts it represents because they look awfully\nthe same on the surface. - That's right.\n- And one of the challenges of being human is the\ndecision we all make is, are you somebody that\ntakes a leap of trust and trust other humans and\nare willing to take the hurt? Or you going to be cynical and skeptical, and avoid most interactions until they over a long period\nof time prove your trust. - Yeah, I never liked the\nphrase history repeats itself when it comes to humans because it doesn't apply if the people or the person is actively working to resolve their own flaws. I do think that if people are willing to do dedicated introspective work, go into their subconscious, do the hard work, have hard conversations, and get better at hard conversations, something that I'm constantly\ntrying to get better at. I think people can change, but they have to want to change. - It does seem like deep down we all can kinda tell the difference between overt and covert. Like we have a good sense. I think one of the benefits\nof having this characteristic of mine where I value loyalty, I've been extremely fortunate to spend most of my life\nin overt relationships. And I think that creates\na really fulfilling life. - But there's also this thing that maybe we're in this\nportion of the podcast now, but I've experienced this-\n- That just brings us this late at night we're talking about.\n- That's right. Certainly late for me, but I'm two hours, I came in today on, I'm\nstill in California. - And we should also say\nthat you came here to wish me a happy birthday.\n- I did. I did, and- - And the podcast is just like a fun last minute thing I suggested. - Yeah, some close friends\nof yours have arranged a dinner that I'm really\nlooking forward to. I won't say which night, but it's the next couple of nights. You know, your circadian clock is one of the most robust\nfeatures of your biology. I know you can be nocturnal\nor you can be diurnal. We know you're mostly\nnocturnal at certain times of the year, Lex, but there're very, very\nfew people can get away with no sleep. Very few people can get away with a chaotic sleep wake schedule. So you have to obey a\n24-hour aka circadian rhythm if you wanna remain\nhealthy of mind and body. We also have to acknowledge that it's aging isn't linear, right? So- - What do you mean?\n- Well, I mean, the degree of change\nbetween years 35 and 40 is not gonna be the degree\nof change between 40 and 45. But I will say this, I'm 48 and I feel better in\nevery aspect of my psychology and biology now than I\ndid when I was in my 20s. Sort of quality of thought, time spent, physically I can do what I did then, which is probably says more\nabout what I could do then than what I can do now. But if you keep training, you\ncan continue to get better. The key is to not get injured. And I've never trained super hard. I've trained hard, but I've been cautious\nto not, for instance, weight train more than two days in a row. I do a split, it's\nbasically three days a week and the other days a run, take one full day-off, take a\nweek-off every 12 to 16 weeks. I've not been the guy\nhurling the heaviest weights or running the furthest distance, but I have been the guy\nwho's continuing to do it when a lot of my friends are\ntalking about knee injuries. - Hey!\n- Talking about (chuckles) - Hey, hey, hey. (chuckles)\n- I'm just... But of course, with sport, you can't account for\neverything the same way you can with fitness. And I have to acknowledge that, you know? Unless one is power lifting, you know, weightlifting and\nrunning, you can get hurt, but it's not like skateboarding where if you're going for it,\nyou're gonna get hurt. That's just, you're landing on concrete and with jiu-jitsu like\npeople are trying to hurt you so that you say stop. - No, but it-\n- So with a sport it's different. And these days, I don't\nreally do a sport any longer. I work out, stay fit. I used to continue to do sports, but I kept getting hurt and frankly now, like a rolled ankle, I may put out a little small\nskateboard part in 2024 because people have been saying\nwe wanna see the kick flip. I'll say, well, I'll do a\nheel flip instead, but okay. I might put out a little part 'cause some of the guys\nthat work on our podcast are from DC, I think by now, I should at least do it just to show like I'm not making it\nup and I probably will. But I think doing a sport is different. That's how you get hurt, overuse and doing it an actual sport. And so, you know, hat tip to\nthose who do an actual sport. - And that's a difficult decision. Like a lot of people have to make, I have to make with jiu-jitsu for example, like if you just look empirically, I've trained really hard from all my life in grappling sports and fighting sports, and all this kind of stuff. And I've avoided injury for the most part. And I would say, I would attribute that to training a lot. Sounds counterintuitive, but training well and\nsafely, and correctly, keeping good form, saying\nno when I need to say no, but training a lot and\ntaking it seriously. Now when training is kind of\na side, really a side thing, I find that the injury is\nbecomes a higher probability. - But when you're just doing\nit every once in a while. - [Lex] Every once in a while. - Yeah, I think you said\nsomething really important. The saying no, I mean, the times I have gotten hurt training is when someone's like, Hey, let's hop on this workout together and it becomes, let's challenge each other to do something outrageous. Sometimes that can be fun though. I went up to Cam Hanes's gym and he does these very high\nrepetition weight workouts that are in circuit form. I was sore for two weeks, but I learned a lot\nand didn't get injured. And yes, we ate bow hunted elk afterwards. - Nice. But the injury has been a really difficult\npsychological thing for me 'cause, so I've injured\nmy finger, pinky finger, injured my knee. - And your kitchen is filled with splints. - Splints, I'm trying to\nfigure out, (chuckles) I'm trying-\n- It's like, if you look in Lex's kitchen, there's some really good\nsnacks, I had some right before. He's very good about keeping\ncold drinks in the fridge and all the water has element\nin it, which is great. I love that. But then there's a whole like\nhospital's worth of splints. - Yeah, I'm trying. I'm trying to figure\nout, so here's the thing, a finger like pop out like this, right? Pinky finger. I'm trying to figure out how\ndo I splint in such a way that I can still program,\nstill play guitar, but protect this kind of torque motion that creates a huge amount of pain. And so-\n- That's you have a jiu-jitsu injury.\n- Jiu-jitsu, but it's not the kind of... It's probably more like a\nskateboarding style injury, which is, it's unexpected\nin a silly thing. - It's the thing that happens in a second. I didn't break my foot\ndoing anything important. I'd broke my fifth metatarsal\nstepping off a curb. So that's why they're called accidents. You know, if you get hurt\ndoing something awesome, that's a trophy that you\nhave to work through. It's part of your payment to the universe. If you get hurt stepping off a curb or you know, doing something stupid, it's called a stupid accident. - Since we brought up Chimp Empire, let me ask you about relationships. I think we've talked about relationships. - Yeah, I only date Homo sapiens. - Homo sapiens. (chuckles) - [Andrew] It's the morning meditation. - The night is still young. You are human. No, but you are also an animal. Don't sell yourself short. - No, I always say listen, any discussion on the Human Lab podcast about sexual health or anything, I always, the critical force, consensual,\nage appropriate context, appropriate, species appropriate. - Species appropriate. Well, can I just tell you\nabout sexual selection? I've been watching \"Life in\nColor\" with David Attenborough. I've been watching a lot\nof nature documentaries, talking about inner peace,\nit brings me so much peace to watch nature at its\nworst and at its best. So Life in Color is the\nseries on Netflix where it presents some of the most\ncolorful animals on earth and kinda tells their\nstory of how they got there through natural selection. So, you know, you have the\npeacock with the feathers and it's just such incredible colors. Like the peacock has these\ntail feathers, the male, that are like gigantic and\nthey're super colorful. And there're these eyes on it, it's not eyes, it's like eye-like areas. And they wiggle their ass\nlike to show the tails. They wiggle the tails.\n- The eye spots, they're called.\n- The eye spots. Yes, thank you. You know this probably way better than me. I'm just quoting it from David Attenborough.\n- No, please continue. - But it's just, I'm watching this and then the female is as\nboring-looking as po... Like she has no colors or nothing, but she's standing there bored, just seeing this entire display. And I'm just wondering like\nthe entirety of life on earth or not the entirety, post bacteria, is like at least in part, maybe in large part can be\ndescribed through this process of natural selection, of sexual selection. So dudes fighting and then women selecting, it seems like it's just\nthe entirety of that series shows some incredible birds\nand insects, and shrimp. They're all beautiful and colorful and just-\n- Mantis shrimp. - Mantis shrimp, they're\njust, they're incredible. And it's all about getting laid. It's fascinating, like I just... And there's nothing like\nwatching that and Chimp Empire to make you realize, we\nhumans, that's the same thing. That's all we're doing. And all the beautiful\nvariety, all the bridges and the buildings, and the\nrockets, and the internet, all of that is this kind,\nis at least in part, this kind of a product of\nthis kind of showing off for each other and all the wars and all of this, anyway, it's not what I'm asking,\noh, relationships. - Well, right before you\nask about relationships, I think what's clear\nis that every species, it seems, animal species\nwants to make more of itself and protect its young. - Well, to protect its\nyoung is non-obvious. - So not destroy enough of\nitself that it can't get more to reproductive competent age. I mean, I think that, you know, we have a natural, I mean, healthy people\nhave a natural reflex to protect children. - Well, I don't know that.\n- And those, that can't- - Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait minute. I've seen enough animals\nthat are murdering the children of some other- - Sure, there's even\nsiblicide there're like, first of all, I just wanna say that I was delighted in your delight\naround animal kingdom stuff 'cause this is a favorite\ntheme of mine as well. But there's for instance,\nsome fascinating data on, for instance, for those\nthat grew up on farms, they'll be familiar with freemartins, you know about freemartins? This is, they're cows that have\nmultiple calves inside them. And there's a situation\nin which the calves will secrete if there's\nmore than one inside will secrete chemicals that\nwill hormonally castrate the calf next to them,\nso they can't reproduce. So already in the womb they are fighting for future resources. That's how early this stuff can start. So it's chemical warfare in\nthe womb against the siblings. Sometimes there's outright\nsiblicide, siblings are born, they kill one another. This also becomes biblical stories, right? There are instances of cuttlefish, beautiful cephalopods like octopuses. And that is the plural as we made it clear-\n- Yeah, it's a meme on the internet.\n- Oh yeah? That became a meme our little discussion two years ago?\n- Yeah, it spread pretty quick. And now we just resurfaced it. (Andrew laughing) - Creating the dismay in\nyour voice is so amusing. In any event, that male cuttlefish\nwill disguise themselves as female cuttlefish infiltrate\nthe female cuttlefish group and then mate with them, you know? All sorts of, you know, types of covert operations.\n- There we go. - [Andrew] So I think that- (chuckles) - Callbacks.\n- It's like a drinking game where every time we say covert\ncontract in this episode, you have to take a shot of espresso. Please don't do that,\nyou'd be dead by the end. - So actually it's just a small tangent, it does make me wonder how much intelligence\ncovert contracts require. It seems like not much. If you can do it in the animal kingdom, there's some kind of instinctual, it is based perhaps in like fear. - Yeah, it could be simple algorithm. If you know, if there's some ambiguity about numbers and I'm not\nwith these guys and you know, then flip to the alternate strategy. Actually, I have a story about this that I think is relevant. I used to have cuttlefish\nin my lab in San Diego. We went and got them from\na guy out in the desert. We put them in the lab, it was amazing. And they had a postdoc who was studying pre-capturing cuttlefish, they have a very ballistic, extremely rapid strike\nand grab of the shrimp. And we were using high-speed cameras to characterize all this\nlooking at binocular. They normally have their eyes\non the side of their head when they see something they want to eat the eyes translocate to the front, which allows 'em stereopsis,\ndepth perception, allows 'em to strike. We were doing some\nunilateral eye removals, they would miss, et cetera. Okay, this has to do with eye spots. This was during a\ngovernment shutdown period where the ghost shrimp\nthat they normally feed on, that we would ship in\nfrom the gulf down here, weren't available to us. So we had to get different shrimp. And what we noticed was\nthe cuttlefish normally would just sneak up on the shrimp. We learned this by data collection. And if the shrimp was facing them, they would do this thing\nwith their tentacles of kind of enchanting the shrimp, and if the shrimp wasn't facing\nthem, they wouldn't do it and they would ballistically\ngrab it and eat them. Well, when we got these new shrimp, the new shrimp had eye\nspots on their tails. And then the cuttlefish\nwould do this kind of attempt to enchant regardless of the\nposition of the ghost shrimp. So what does that mean? Okay, well, it means that\nthere's some sort of algorithm in the cuttlefish's mind that says, okay, if you see two spots, move your tentacles. So it can be, as you pointed out, it can be a fairly simple operation, but it looks diabolical. It looks cunning, but\nall it is, is strategy B. - Yeah, but it's still somehow emerged. I mean, I don't think that\ncalling it an algorithm doesn't, I feel like-\n- Well, there's a circuit there that gets implemented\nin a certain context, but that circuit had to evolve. - You do realize a super intelligent AI will look at us humans and\nwe'll say the exact thing. There's a circuit in there that evolved to do this algorithm A and algorithm B. And it's trivial. And to us humans, it's fancy and beautiful and write poetry about it, but it's just surreal.\n- Because so we don't understand the subconscious because they want that\nAI algorithm cannot see into what it can't see. It doesn't understand the under workings of what allows all of this\nconversation stuff to manifest. And we can't even see it. How could AI see it? Maybe it will, maybe AI will solve and give us access to our subconscious. Maybe your AI friend or coach, like I think Andreessen and others are arguing it's gonna happen\nat some point it's gonna say, Hey, you know, Lex, you're making decisions lately\nthat are not good for you, but it's because of this algorithm that you picked up in childhood that if you don't state\nyour explicit needs upfront, you're not gonna get what\nyou want, so why do it? From now on, you need\nto actually make a list of every, absolutely, outrageous thing that you want no matter how outrageous and communicate that immediately. And that will work. - We're talking about\ncuttlefish and sexual selection, and then we went into\nsome, where do we go? And you said you were excited. - Well, I was excited where you were just saying what\nabout these covert contracts and animals do them, I think\nis simple contextual engagement of a neural circuit, which\nis not just nerd speak for saying they do a different strategy. It's saying that there\nhas to be a circuit there, hardwired circuit, maybe learned, but probably hardwired\nthat can be engaged, right? You can't build neural\nmachinery out of, in a moment, you need to build that circuit over time. What is building it over\ntime? You select for it. The cuttlefish that did not have that alternate context-driven circuit, didn't survive when there was a, when all the shrimp that they\nnormally disappear in the, the eye-spotted shrimp showed up and there were a couple\nthat had some miswiring, this is why mutation, right? X-Men type stuff is real. They had a mutation that\nhad some alternate wiring and that wiring got selected for, it became a mutation that was adaptive as opposed to maladaptive. This is something people\ndon't often understand about genetics is that it only takes a few\ngenerations to devolve a trait, make it worse, but it takes a long time to\nevolve an adaptive trait. There are exceptions to that, but most often that's true. So a species needs a lot of generations. We are hopefully, still\nevolving as a species and it takes a long time, but to evolve more adaptive traits. But doesn't take long to\ndevolve adaptive traits so that you're getting sicker or you're not functioning as well. So choose your mate wisely. And that's perhaps a good\nsegue into sexual selection of humans.\n- I could tell you're good at this. (Andrew chuckling) We said why did I bring\nup sexual selection? It's relationships, so\nsexual selection in humans. I don't think you've done\nan episode on relationships. - No, I did an episode on attachment, but not on relationships. The series with Conti includes\none episode of the four that's all about relational understanding and how to select a mate based\non matching of drives and- - All the demons inside the subconscious? How to match demons that they\ndance well together or what? - And how generative two people are. - [Lex] What does that mean? - Means that how, the\nway he explains it is, how devoted to creating\ngrowth within the context of the family, the relationship with work. - Well, lemme ask you about mating rituals and how to find such a relationship? I mean, you're really big on friendships, on the value of friendships. - I am. - And that I think extends itself into one of the deepest kinds of\nfriendships you can have, which is a romantic relationship. What mistakes, successes and wisdom can you impart? - Well, I've certainly made some mistakes. I've also made some good\nchoices in this realm. First of all, we have to define what sort of relationship\nwe're talking about. If one is looking for a life partner, you know, potentially somebody\nto establish family with, with or without kids, with\nor without pets, right? Families can take different forms. I mean, I certainly\nexperienced being a family in a prior relationship\nwhere it was the two of us and our two dogs. And it was like, it was family. Like we had a little family. I think based on my\nexperience and based on input from friends who themselves have very successful relationships. I must say, I've got friends\nwho are in long-term, monogamous, very happy relationships where there seems to be a lot\nof love, a lot of laughter, a lot of challenge and a lot of growth. And both people it seems\nreally want to be there and enjoy being there. - Just to pause on that, one thing to do, I think, by way of advice is listen to people who are in long-term successful relationships. That's like, it seems dumb, but like we both know and\nare friends with Joe Rogan, who's been in a long-term,\nreally great relationship and he's been an inspiration to me. So you take advice from that guy? - Definitely. And several members of my podcast team are in excellent relationships. I think one of the things\nthat rings true over and over again in the advice\nand in my experience is, you know, find someone\nwho's really a great friend. Like build a really great\nfriendship with that person. Now, obviously, not just a friend if we're talking romantic relationship, but, and of course,\nsex is super important, but it should be a part of\nthat particular relationship alongside or meshed with the friendship. Can it be a majority of\nthe positive exchange? I suppose it could, but I think the friendship\npiece is extremely important because what's required in a\nsuccessful relationship clearly is joy in being together. Trust, a desire to share experience both, you know, mundane and more\nadventurous, support each other, acceptance, a real, maybe even admiration, but certainly delight in\nbeing with the person. You know, earlier we\nwere talking about peace, and I think that that sense\nof peace comes from knowing that the person you're in friendship with or that you're in romantic\nrelationship or ideally both 'cause let's assume healthy relation, the best romantic relationship includes a friendship component with that person. It's like you just really\ndelight in their presence, even if it's a quiet presence and you delight in seeing\nthem delight in things, right? That's clear. The trust piece is huge, you know, and that's where people start, you know, we don't wanna\nfocus on what works, not what doesn't work, but that's where I think people start engaging these covert contracts. They're afraid of being\nbetrayed, so they betray. They're afraid of giving\nup too much vulnerability so they hide their vulnerability\nor in the worst cases, they feign vulnerability. Again, that's a covert contract that just simply undermines everything, it becomes one, both one equals\ntwo minus one to infinity. Conversely, I think if people can have really hard conversations, this is something I've\nhad to work really hard on in recent years that I'm\nstill working hard on, but the friendship piece\nseems to be the thing that rises to the top\nwhen I talk to friends who are in these great relationships. It's like they have so\nmuch respect and love, and joy in being with their friend. It's the person that they wanna spend as much of their non-working, non-platonic friendship time with and the person they want\nto experience things with, and share things with. And it sounds so kinda\ncanned and cliche nowadays, but I think if you step back\nand examine how most people go about finding a\nrelationship, sort of like, oh, like am I attracted, of\ncourse, physical attraction is important and other\nforms of attraction too, and they sort of enter\nthrough that portal, which makes sense. That's the mating dance, right? That's the peacock situation. That's hopefully not the\ncuttlefish situation where the, (chuckles) but I think that there seems to be a\nhistory of people close to me getting into great relationships where they were friends for a while first or maybe didn't sleep together right away. That they actually\nintentionally deferred on that. This has not been my\nhabit or my experience, you know, I've gone the\nmore I think typical like, oh, there's an\nattraction like this person, there's an interest, you\nkinda explore all dimensions of relationship really quickly, except perhaps the moving in\npart and the having kids part, which ideally because it's a bigger step, harder to undo without\nmore severe consequences. But I think, the whole take it slow thing, I don't think is about getting\nto know someone slowly. I think it's about that physical piece because that does change the\nnature of the relationship. And I think it's because it gets right into the more hardwired\nprimitive circuitry around our feelings of\nsafety, vulnerability, you know, there's something about romantic and sexual interactions\nwhere it's almost like, it's like assets and liabilities, right? Where people are trying to figure out how much to engage their\ntime and their energy, in multiple people, I'm\ntalking about from both sides, you know, male, female\nor whatever it sides, but where it's like\nassets and liabilities, and that's where it starts getting into those complicated\ncontracts early on, I think. And so maybe that's why if\na really great friendship and admiration is established first, even if people are romantically\nand sexually attracted to one another, then that\npiece can be added in a little bit later in a way that really kinda just seals\nup the whole thing. And then who knows, maybe they spend 90% of their\ntime having sex, I don't know, that's not for me to say\nor decide, obviously. But there's something\nthere about staying out of a certain amount of risk of having to engage covert contract in order to protect oneself. - But I do think like, love at first sight, this\nkind of idea is in part realizing very quickly\nthat you are great friends. Like I've had that experience\nof friendship recently. It's not really friendship, but like, oh, you get\neach other, with humans, not in a romantic setting. - Right, friendship.\n- Yeah, just friendship, but not-\n- Well, but dare I say, I felt that way about you when we met, right?\n- But we also- - I was like, this dude's cool and he's smart, and he's\nfunny, and he's driven, and he's giving, and he's\ngot an edge, and like, I wanna learn from him,\nwanna hang out with him. Like, I mean, that was the\nbeginning of our friendship was essentially, you know, that set of internal realizations. - Just keep going, just keep going. Keep going with compliments.\n- And a sharp dresser. - Yeah, yeah, it just looks great. Shirtless on a horseback, yes. - No, no, no. Listen, I mean, despite\nwhat some people might see on the internet, it's a\npurely platonic friendship. - Somebody said, somebody\nasked if Andrew Huberman has a girlfriend, and\nsomebody says, I think so. And the third comment was, this really like breaks my heart, like that Lex and Andrew are not an item. - We are not, we are great\nfriends, but we are not an item. Yeah, it's true, it's official. I hear over and over again from friends that have made great choices\nand awesome partners, and have these fantastic relationships for long periods of time that\nseem to continue to thrive. At least that's what they tell me, and that's what I observed. Establish the friendship first and give it a bit of time before sex. And so, you know, I\nthink that's the feeling. That's the feeling. And these are, we're\ntalking micro-features and macro-features. We're talking, you know, and this isn't about perfection, it's actually about the imperfections, which is kind of cool. I like quirky people, I like characters. I'll tell you where I've gone badly wrong and where I see other\npeople going badly wrong. If there is no rule that says\nthat you have to be attracted to all attractive people, by any means, it's very\nimportant to develop a sense of taste in romantic attractions. I believe what you really like\nin terms of a certain style, you know, a certain way of being, and of course, that includes\nsexuality and sex itself, the verb. But I think it also includes\nthere's just general way of being, you know? And when you really adore somebody, you like the way they answer the phone. And when they don't\nanswer the phone that way, you know, something's\noff and you wanna know. And so I think that the more you can tune-up\nyour powers of observation, not looking for things that you like, and the more that stuff\njust kinda washes over you, the more likely you are to,\nquote-unquote, \"fall in love.\" As a mutual friend of ours said to me, \"You know, listen, when it\ncomes to romantic relationships, if it's not a hundred percent\nin you, it ain't happening.\" And I've never seen a\nviolation of that statement where it's like, yeah, it's mostly good and\nthey're this and this, like the negotiations. Well, already, it's doomed. And that doesn't mean\nsomeone has to be perfect. The relationship has to be perfect, but it's gotta feel a\nhundred percent inside. Like, yes, yes, and yes. I think Deisseroth, when he\nwas on here, your podcast, mentioned something that, you know, like, I think the words were you, or maybe it was in his\nbook, I don't recall. But that, you know, love\nis one of these things that we story into with somebody. We create this idea of\nourselves in the future and we look at our past time together and then you, you story into it. I mean, there are very\nfew things like that, I can't story into, you\nknow, building flying cars. I have to actually go do something. I mean, and love is also\nretroactively constructed. I mean, anyone who's\ngone through a breakup understands the grief of knowing, oh, like this is something\nI really shouldn't be in, for whatever reason, 'cause it only takes one. If the other person\ndoesn't want to be in it, then you shouldn't be in it. But then missing so many things, and that's just the attachment\nmachinery really at work. - I have to ask you a\nquestion that somebody on our amazing team wanted to ask. He's happily married, another like you mentioned\nincredible relationship. - Are they good friends? - They're amazing friends.\n- There you go. - But I'm not saying who it\nis, so I can say some stuff, which is they, it started out\nas a great sexual connection. - Oh, well there you go. - But then became very\nclose friends after that. - Okay, listening-\n- There you go. - So speaking of sex-\n- Many paths to Rome. - He has a wonderful son and he is wanting to have a second kid, and he wanted to ask the\ngreat Andrew Huberman, is there like sexual\npositions or any kinda thing that can help maximize the chance that they have a girl versus a boy? 'Cause they had a wonderful\nboy, they want a girl. Is there a way to control the gender? - Well, this has been\ndebated for a long time and I did a four and a half\nhour episode on fertility. And the reason I did a four\nand a half hour episode on fertility is that, first of all, I find it that reproductive\nbiology be fascinating. And I wanted a resource for people that were thinking about or\nstruggling with having kids for whatever reason. And it felt important to me to combine the male and female components\nin the same episode. It's all timestamped, so you don't have to\nlisten to the whole thing. We talk about IVF, in vitro fertilization and we talk about natural pregnancy. Okay, the data on position\nis very interesting. But let me just say a few things. There are a few clinics now in particular, some out of the United States\nthat are spinning down sperm and finding that they can\nseparate out fractions as they're called, you know, that can spin the sperm\ndown at a given speed and they'll separate out at different sort of depths within the test tube that allow them to pull\nout the sperm on top or below and bias the probability towards male or female births. It's not perfect. It's not a hundred percent. It's a very costly procedure. It's still very controversial. Now with in vitro fertilization, you can extract eggs, you can\ndo introduce a sperm directly by pipette and it's a process called ICSI or you can set up a sperm race in a dish. And if you get a number\nof different embryos, meaning the eggs get\nfertilized to duplicate and start form a blastocyst,\nwhich is a ball of cells, early embryo, then you can do karyotyping. So you can do, look for\nXX or XY, select the XY, which then would give\nrise to a male offspring and implant that one. So there is that kind of sex selection. With respect to position,\nthere's a lot of lore that, you know, if the woman is on top or the woman's on the bottom, or whether or not the\npenetration is from behind, whether or not it's gonna\nbe male or female offspring. And frankly, the data are\nnot great as you can imagine 'cause those would be interesting\nstudies to run, perhaps. - But there is studies, there is papers. - [Andrew] There are some- - But they're not, I guess. there's more lore than sciences. - And there are a lot of other variables that are hard to control. So for instance, if it's\nejaculation during intermission, during sex penetration, et cetera, then you can't measure, for instance, sperm volume as opposed to when it's IVF, and they can actually\nmeasure how many milliliters, how many forward motile\nsperm, it's hard to control for certain things. And it just can vary between individuals and even from one ejaculation to the next. And, okay, so there's too many variables. However, the position thing is interesting in the following way. And then I'll answer\nwhether or not you can bias towards a female. But as long as we're talking about sexual- - [Lex] I have other questions about sexual-\n- But as long as we're talking about sexual position. There are data that support the idea that in order to increase the probability of successful fertilization, that indeed the woman should\nnot stand upright after sex and should right after the\nman has ejaculated inside her and should adjust her pelvis,\nsay 15 degrees upwards. I mean, you know, some\nof the fertility experts, MDs will say, that's crazy, you know, but others that I sought out, and not specifically for this answer, but for researching\nthat episode, said that, yeah, you know what? You're talking about is trying to get the\nmaximum number of sperm and it's contained in semen and\nyes, the semen can leak out. And so keeping the pelvis\ntilted for about at 15 degrees for about 15 minutes, obviously, tilted in the direction that would have things running\nupstream, not downstream, so to speak.\n- Yeah, gravity. - Gravity, it's real, you know, so for maximizing fertilization, you know, the doctors\nI spoke to just said, look, given that if people\nare trying to get pregnant, what is spending 15 minutes on their back, you know, this sort of thing. Okay, so then with\nrespect to female getting a female offspring or XX,\nfemale offspring, selectively, there is the idea that\nas fathers get older, they're more likely to have\ndaughters as opposed to sons. That's a, from the papers I've\nread is a significant, but still mildly significant result. So with each passing year, this person increases the probability they're gonna have a daughter, not a son. But look, so that's interesting. - But the probability differences\nare probably tiny as you- - I mean, it's not, you\nknow, it's not trivial, it's not a trivial difference. But if they want to\nensure having a daughter, then they should do IVF\nand select an XX embryo. And when you go through IVF, they genetically screen\nthem for karyotype, which is XX, XY. And they look at mutations, genotypic mutations for things like, you know, trisomies and aneuploidies, all the stuff you don't want. - But there is a lot of lore if you look on the internet.\n- Sure, different foods- - [Lex] So there are a lot of variables- - There's a lot of variable, but there haven't been systematic studies. So I think probably the best thing to do, unless they're gonna do\nIVF is just, you know, roll the dice and you know, and I think with each\npassing year they increase the probability of getting\na female offspring, but of course, with each passing year, the egg and sperm quality degrade, so, you know, get after it soon. - So I went down a rabbit hole. There's like sexology,\nthere's journals on sex. - Sure. - Okay, so-\n- And some of them, some of them, not all quite reputable. And some of them really\npioneering in the sense that they've taken on topics that are, you know, considered, you know, outside the main\nframe of what people talk about, but they're very important. We have episodes coming out\nsoon with, for instance, the head of male urology, sexual health and reproductive health at\nStanford, Michael Eisenberg, but also, you know, one with a female\nurologist, sexual health, reproductive health, Dr. Rena Malik, who is on, has a quite\nactive YouTube presence. She does these really like dry, like scientific\npresentation, but very nice. She has a lovely voice and she, but she'll be talking about, you know, erections or squirting, or like all this, like she does like very kind\nof internet type content, but she's a legitimate urologist, reproductive health expert. And in the podcast, we did talk about both male and female orgasm. We talked a lot about sexual\nfunction, dysfunction. We talked a lot about pelvic floor. One interesting factoid is that only three, only 3% of\nsexual dysfunction is hormonal endocrine in nature. It's more often related\nto some pelvic floor or vasculature blood flow\nrelated, or other issue. And then when Eisenberg,\nhe came on the podcast, he said that far less sexual dysfunction is psychogenic in origin than people believe that far\nmore of it is pelvic floor, neuro and vascular. So, you know, there are the myths of, I mean, it's not saying that psychogenic\ndysfunction doesn't exist, but that a lot of sexual\ndysfunction that people assume is related to hormones or that is related to psychogenic issues\nare related to vascular or neural issues. And the good news is that there are great remedies for those. And so both those episodes detail some of the more salient points\naround what those remedies are and could be, I mean, one of\nthe kind of, again, factoids, but it was interesting that, you know, a lot of people have pelvic floor issues and they think that their pelvic floors are quote-unquote, \"messed up.\" So they go on the internet, they learn about Kegels, you know, and it turns out that\nsome people need Kegels, they need to strengthen their\npelvic floor, guess what? A huge number of people with\nsexual and urologic dysfunction have pelvic floors that are too tight and Kegels are gonna make them far worse. And they actually need to learn\nto relax their pelvic floor. And so seeing a pelvic floor\nspecialist is important. I think in the next 5, 10 years, we're gonna see a dramatic\nshift towards more discussion about sexual and reproductive health in a way that acknowledges that, yeah, the clitoris comes\nfrom the same origin tissue as the penis. And in many ways, the neural\ninnervation of the two, while clearly different, has\nsome overlapping features that you know, that there's\ngonna be discussion around kind of anatomy and\nhormones, and pelvic floors, and in a way that's gonna, you know, erode some of the kind of\nlike cloaking of these topics 'cause they've been\ncloaked for a long time and there's a lot of like, well, let's just call it what it is, there's a lot of bullshit\nout there about what's what. And now the hormonal issues, by the way, just to clarify, can impact desire. So a lot of people who have lack of desire as opposed to lack of anatomical function, this could be male or female, that can originate with\neither things like SSRIs, or hormonal issues. And so we talk about that as well. So it's a pretty vast topic. - Okay, you're one of the\nmost productive people I know. What's the secret to your productivity? How do you maximize the number\nof productive hours in a day? You're a scientist, you're a teacher, you're a very prolific educator. - Well, thanks for the kind words. I struggle like everybody else, but I am pretty relentless about meeting deadlines. I miss them sometimes, but sometimes that means cramming. Sometimes that means starting early, but- - Has that been hard, sorry to\ninterrupt, with the podcast, there's certain episodes, I mean, you're like taking just\nincredibly difficult topics and you know, there're going to be, there's going to be a lot\nof really good scientists listening to those with a very\nskeptical and careful eye. Like how hard, do you struggle meeting\nthat deadline sometimes? - Yes, so we've pushed out episodes because I want more time with them. I also, I haven't advertised this, but I have another fully tenured professor that's started checking my podcasts and helping me find papers. He's a close friend of mine, he's an incredible\nexpert in neuroplasticity and that's been helpful. But I research all my all, I\ndo all the primary research for the episodes myself. Although, my niece has been\ndoing a summer internship with me and finding amazing papers. She did last summer as well,\nshe's really good at it. Just seek that kid on the\ninternet and she gets great stuff. - Can I ask you just\ngoing on tangents here, what's the hardest, finding the papers or understanding what a paper is saying? - Finding the best papers. 'Cause you have to, you know,\nread a bunch of reviews, figure out who's getting cited. Call people in a field, make\nsure that this is the stuff. I mean, you know, I did\nthis episode recently on ketamine, about ketamine. I wasn't on ketamine and you know, there's this whole debate\nabout S versus R Ketamine and S/R Ketamine. And I called two clinical\nexperts at Stanford. I had a researcher at UCLA help me. Even then, you know, a few\npeople had gripes about it, that I don't think they\nunderstood a section that I was perhaps could\nhave been clearer about. But yeah, you're always\nconcerned that people either won't get it or I won't be clear. So the researching is mainly\nabout finding the best papers, and then I'm looking for\npapers that establish a thoroughness of understanding that are interesting, obviously, it's fun to get occasionally\nlook at some of the odder or more progressive\npapers that are, you know, what's new in a field and then where there are actionable takeaways to really export those with\na lot of thoughtfulness. I mean, I think that going\nback to the productivity thing, you know, I do, I get\nup, I look at the sun. I don't stare at the sun,\nbut I get my sunshine. It all starts with a\nreally good night's sleep. I think that's really\nimportant to understand. So much so that if I wake up\nand I don't feel rested enough, I'll often do a non-sleep\ndeep rest, yoga nidra, or go back to sleep for\na little bit, get up, really prioritize one, you know, the big block of work for the\nthing that I'm researching. I think a little bit of anxiety\nand a little bit of concern about deadline helps. Turning the phone off helps. Realizing that those peak hours, whenever they are for you, you do not allow those hours to be invaded unless there's a, you know,\na nuclear bomb goes off. And a nuclear bomb is just a,\nyou know, a phraseology for, you know, it could be family\ncrisis, would be, you know, would be good justification if there's an emergency, obviously. But it's all about focus. It's all about focus in the moment. It's not even so much about\nhow many hours you log. It's really about focus in the moment. How much total focus can\nyou give to something? And then I like to take\nwalks and think about things and sometimes talk about\nthem in my voice recorder. So I'm just always churning\non it all the time. And then of course, learning to turn it off and\nengage with people socially and, you know, not be\npodcasting 24 hours a day in your head is key. But I think I love\nlearning and researching, and finding that those\npapers and the information, and I love teaching it. And these days I use a\nwhiteboard before I start. I don't have any notes, no teleprompter. Then the whiteboard that I used beforehand is to really sculpt out the\ndifferent elements and the flow, get the flow right,\nand move things around. The whiteboard is such a valuable tool. Then take a couple pictures of\nthat when I'm happy with it, put it down on the desk and\nthese are just bullet points and then just churn through,\nand just churn through. And nothing feels better than, you know, researching\nand sharing information. And as you did, you know,\ngrew up writing papers and it's hard. And I like the friction of a, (grunts) can't, you know, I wanna get\nup, wanna use the bathroom. When I was in college, I was trying to make up deficiencies from my lack of attendance in high school. So much so that I would set a timer. I wouldn't let myself get up\nto use the bathroom, even. Never had an accident, but I was, you know, I mean, it was like, I listened\nto music, classical music, Rancid, a few other things. Some Bob Dylan maybe thrown in there and just study and just... And it felt, and then, you know, hit the two-hour mark and you're in pain, and then you get up,\nlike use the bathroom. Like, that felt so good. There's something about the human brain that likes these kind of friction points and working through them and you just have to work through them. So yeah, I'm productive and my life has arranged\naround it and you know, that's been a bit of a barrier\nto personal life at times, but my life's been arranged around it. I've set up everything so that\nI can learn more, teach more, including, you know, some of my home life. But I do, you know,\nstill watch Chimp Empire. Still got time to watch Chimp Empire. Look, the great Joe Strummer, right, Clash or my favorite Mescaleros, he said, this is a famous Strummer\nquote, \"no input, no output.\" So you need experience, you\nneed outside things in order to foster the process. But yeah, just noses the\ngrindstone man, I don't know. And that's what I'm\nhappy to do with my life. I don't think anyone should\ndo that, just because, but this is how I'm showing up. And, you know, if you\ndon't like me, then scroll. Why do they say swipe left, swipe right? I don't know. I'm not on the apps, the dating apps. So that's the other thing\nI keep waiting for when listens to Lex Fridman\npodcast is a check box on like Hinge or Bumble,\nor whatever it is. But I don't even know are\nthose that are field is, I don't know what are the apps now? - Well, I've never used an app, those foul troublesome\nhow little information is provided on apps. - Well, they're the ones\nthat are like a stocked lake. Like Raya, you know? They sort of like, companies\nwill actually fill them with, you know?\n- Oh, interesting. - People that look a certain way and- - Well, soon it'll be filled with AI. - Oh yeah. - That's the way you said, oh. - Oh, that's interesting.\n- A heartbreak within that. - Well, you know, I'm guilty of liking real human interaction. - Have you tried AI interaction? (Lex and Andrew chuckling) - No, but I have a feeling\nyou're gonna convince me to. (Lex and Andrew chuckling) - One day. Yeah, I've also struggled\nfinishing projects that are new, that are something new. Like for example, one of the things I\nreally struggled finishing is something that's in Russian\nthat requires translation and overdub, and all that kind of stuff. The other project I've\nbeen working on for like, over at least a year, off and on, but trying to finish is something we've talked\nabout in the past is, I'm still on it project on\nHitler and World War II. I've written so much about it and I just don't know\nwhy I can't finish it. I have trouble, like really... I think I'm terrified being\nin front of the camera. - Like this? - Like this.\n- Or solo? - Well, actually, no, no, no. Solo, basically.\n- Well, if you wanna do solo and seriously, 'cause we've\ndone this before, right? Our clandestine study missions. I'm happy to sit in the\ncorner and work on my book or do something if you\nwanna, if it feels good- - Just for the feeling of somebody else. - Definitely.\n- What do you, I mean, how do you... You don't seem to, you seem to have been fearless, to just sit in front of\nthe camera by yourself to do the episode. - Yeah, it was weird. I mean, the first year of the podcast, it just spilled outta me. It was just, I had all that\nstuff I was so excited about. I've been talking to\neveryone and who would listen and anyone even when, who they'd run away, I'd keep talking, you know, before there was ever a\ncamera wasn't on social media. In 2019, I posted a little\nbit, 2020, as you know, I started going on podcasts. But yeah, I just... The zest and delight in this stuff. I was like, circadian rhythms, I'm gonna tell you about this stuff. Just felt like, here's the opportunity and just let it burst. And then as we've gotten into topics that are a little bit further\naway from my home knowledge, you know, like I still get\nsuper excited about it. It's music in the brain\nepisode I've been researching for a while now, I'm just so hyped, I keep thinking about it. It's so interesting. There's so many facets. Singing versus improvisational,\nexcuse me, music versus I'm listening to\nmusic versus learning music. I mean that, it just goes on and on. There's just so much,\nthat's so interesting. I just can't get enough and I think, I dunno, you put a camera in front of me, I sort of forget about it and\nI'm just trying to just teach. - Yeah, so that's the\ndifference, that's interesting. I mean-\n- Forget the camera. - Maybe I need to find that joy as well, but like for me, a lot of\nthe joys in the writing, and the camera, there's something- - Well, the best lecturers, as you know, and you're in a phenomenal lecturer, so you embody this as well. But when I teach at Stanford, I was directing this\ncourse in neuroanatomy and neuroscience for medical students. And I noticed that the best\nlecturers would come in and they're teaching the material from a place of deep understanding, but they're also experiencing\nit as a first-time learner as at the same time. So it's just sort of\nembodying the delight of it, but also the authority\nover the, not authority, but the sort of mastery of the material. And it's really the delight in it that the students are linking onto it. And of course, they need and deserve the best accurate material, so they have to know what\nthey're talking about. But yeah, just tap into\nthat energy of learning and loving it, and people\nare long for the ride. Or you know, I get accused\nof being long-winded, but, you know, things\nget taken outta context that leads to greater misunderstanding. And also I look at, listen, I come from a lineage\nof three dead advisors, three, all three. So I don't know when the\nreaper's coming for me. I'm doing my best to\nstay alive a long time. But whether or not it's a\nbullet or a bus, or cancer, whatever, or just old age, I mean, I'm trying to get it all\nout there as best I can. And if it means you have to hit pause and come back a day or two later, like, that seems like a\nreasonable compromise to me. I'm not gonna go longer than I need to and I'm trying to shorten them up. But again, that's kinda how I show up. It's like Tim Armstrong would\nsay about writing songs. I asked him, do you write,\nhow often do you write? Every day? Every day. Has Rick ever stopped creating? No. Has Joe ever stopped preparing for comedy? Are you ever stopping to\nthink about world issues and technology and who you can talk to? I mean, it seems to me\nyou've always got a plan, the insight. The thing I love about\nyour podcast the most, to be honest these days, is the surprise of like, I don't know who\nthe hell's gonna be there. It's almost like, I get a\nlittle nervously excited about when a new episode\ncomes 'cause I have no idea. No idea. And you know, I mean, I have some guesses based on what you told\nme during the break. I mean, you've got some\npeople where it's just like, whoa! Lex has went there? Awesome. Can't wait, click. You know, I think that's really cool. Like, you're constantly surprising people. So you're doing it so well. Like, it's such a high-level. And I think it's also important\nfor people to understand that what you're doing, Lex,\nthere's no precedent for it. Sure, there have been interviews before, there have been podcasts before. There are discussions before, but it's not like, how many\nof your peers can you look to, to find out how best to\ndo the content like yours? Zero. There's one peer, you. And so, you know, that\nshould give you great peace and great excitement because you're a pioneer. You're literally the tip of the spear. I don't wanna take an unnecessary tangent, but I think this might thread together two of the things that we've been\ntalking about, which are, I think of pretty key importance. One is romantic relationships, and the other is creative\nprocess and the work. And this again, is something\nI learned from Rick, but that he and I have\ngone back and forth on. And that I think is worth\nelaborating on, which is, earlier we were saying, you know, the best\nrelationship is gonna be one where it brings you peace. I think peace also can be\ntranslated to, among other things, lack of distraction. So when you're with your partner, can you really focus on\nthem and the relationship? Can you not be distracted by things that you're upset about from their past or from your past with them or their, and of course, the same\nis true for them, right? They ideally will feel\nthat way towards you too, they can really focus. Also, when you're not with them, can you focus on your work? Can you not be worried about\nwhether or not they're okay? 'Cause you trust that they're an adult and they can handle things\nor they will reach out if they need things? They're gonna communicate\ntheir needs like an adult, you know, not creating\nmessage just to get attention and things like that. Or disappearing, you\nknow, for that matter. So peace and focus are intimately related, and distraction is the\nenemy of peace and focus. So there's something there, I believe, because with people that have\nthe strong generative drive and want to, you know, be productive in their\nhome life in the sense have a rich family life or\npartner life, whatever that is. And in their work life, you know, the ability to\nreally drop into the work and like, okay, you might\nhave that sense like, I hope they're okay or, you know, need to check my phone or something. But just know like, we're good. So peace and focus, I think\nbeing present are so key. And it's key at every level\nof romantic relationship from, you know, certainly presence\nand focus, you know, everything from sex to listening to, you know, raising a family, to tending to the house and in work, it's absolutely critical. So I think that those things\nare kind of mirror images of the same thing. And they're both important\nreflections of the other. And when you start to\njust, you know, when work is not going well, then the\nfocus on relationship can suffer and vice versa. - And it's crazy how important that is. How incredibly wonderful\nit could be to have a person in your life that kind of enables that creative focus. - Yeah, and you supply the peace and focus for their endeavors,\nwhatever those might be. I mean that symmetry there, because clearly, people\nhave different needs and the need to just really trust, you know, like when Lex is working, he's in his generative\nmode and I know he's good. And so then they feel sure\nthey've contributed to that, but then also what you're\ndoing is supporting them in whatever way it happens to be. And I think that sometimes\nyou'll see that people will pair up along creative,\ncreative or musical, musical, or computer scientists. But I think, again, going\nback to this Conti episode on relationships is that\nthe superficial labels are less important it\nseems than just the desire to create that kind of home\nlife and relationship together. And as a consequence, the work mode. And for some people they're\nboth people aren't working. And sometimes they are. But I think that's the\ngood stuff, you know? And I think that's the\nbig learning in all of it, is that the further along\nI go with each birthday, I guarantee you're gonna be like, what I want is simpler and simpler, and harder and harder to\ncreate, but oh, so worth it. - The inner and the outer peace. It's been over two years, I think since Costello passed away. - [Andrew] It still tears me up. - You mentioned him still.\n- I cried about him today, I cried about him today.\n- Still? - It's proportional to the love. But yeah, I'll cry about it\nright now if I think about it. It wasn't putting him down, it wasn't the act of\nhim dying any of that. Actually, that was a beautiful experience. I didn't expect it to be, but it was in my place when\nI was living in Topanga during the pandemic where\nwe launched the podcast and I did it at home. And he hated the vets, I did it at home. And it was, he gave out\nthis huge (deep sigh) right at the end. And I could just tell he had been in just not a lot pain, fortunately, but he had just been working\nso hard just to move at all. And the craziest thing happened,\nLex is, was unbelievable. I've never had an experience like this. I expected my heart to break. And I've felt a broken heart before. I felt it, frankly, when my parents split, I felt it when Harry shot himself. I felt it when Barbara died and felt it, when, you know,\nwhen Ben went, so as well. And so many friends, like\nway too many friends. I mean, the end of 2017,\nmy friend Aaron King, Johnny Farer, John Eckelberry, stomach cancer, suicide, fentanyl. It's like, whoa! All in a freaking week. And I just remember\nthinking like, what the? But when Cost... And it's just heartbreaking,\nyou just carry that. And it's like, (grunts) and that's just a short list, you know? And I don't say that for sob story, it's just for a guy that\nwasn't in the military or didn't grow up in the inner city, like it's an unusual\nnumber of like deaths, like close people. When Costello went, the\ncraziest thing happened. My heart warmed up, like heated up. And I wasn't on MDMA and\njust the moment he went, it just went whoosh! And I was like, what the hell is this? And it was just like a\nsupernatural experience to me. I just never had that. I put my grandfather on the ground, I was a pallbearer at the funeral. I've like done that more times than I'd like to have ever done it. And it just heated up with\nCostello and I thought, what the fuck is this? And it was almost like, and\nwe make up these stories about what it is, but it was almost like\nhe was like, all right, I have to be careful 'cause I will cry here\nand I don't want to. It was almost like, he\nwas like, all that effort 'cause I had been putting\nso much effort into him, it was like, alright, you get that back. It was like the giant freaking thank you. And it was incredible, you know? And I'm not embarrassed to\nshed a tear or two about it if I have to, I was like, holy shit! Like that's how close\nI was to that animal. - Where do you think, where do you think you can\nfind that kind of love again? - Man, I don't know. I mean, when, and excuse\nme for welling up, but it was just, I mean,\nit's a freaking dog, right? I get it. But for me, it was the\nfirst real home I ever had. But when Costello went, it was like, we had had this home in Topanga. We had set it up and we're like, and he was just so happy there. And I think it just... I don't know, it was like this weird like victory slash massive loss. Like we did it 11 years. Freaking did everything to make him as comfortable as possible. And he was super loyal, beautiful animal, but also just funny and fun. And I was like, I did it. Like, you know, I gave as much of myself\nto this being as a human. I felt I could without\nmaking it, you know, like, you know, detracting\nfrom the rest of my life. And so I don't know, when I think about Barbara especially, I well up and it's hard for me, but I mean, I talked\nto her before she died and that was a brutal conversation. Saying goodbye to someone, especially with kids. And that was hard. I think that really flipped a\nswitch in me where I'm like, I always knew I wanted kids. I'd say I want kids, I want a lot of kids. That flipped a switch in me. I was like, I want kids. I want my own kids. - [Lex] You might be able\nto find that kind of love. - Yeah, I think because\nit was the caretaking, it wasn't about what he\ngave me all that time. And the more I could take\ncare of him and see him happy, the better I felt, it's crazy. And, I don't know. So I miss him every day, every day. I miss him every day. - You got a heart that's so full of love. I can't wait for you to have kids. - Thanks man.\n- For you to be a father. - Yeah, well, - I can't wait to say-\n- when I'm ready for it. When, you know, when God decides\nI'm ready, I'll have 'em. - And then I will still beat you to it. As I told you many times before. - I think you should absolutely have kids. I mean, look at the people in our life 'cause we're kind of the... In case you haven't realized it already, like we're the younger of the podcasters, but you know, like Joe\nand Peter, and Segura, and you know, and the rest, right? They're like the tribal elders, right? And we're, you know, we're not the the youngest in the crew, but if you look at all those\nguys, they all have kids. They all adore their kids and their kids bring tremendous\nmeaning to their life. Like we'd be morons if, you know, if you didn't\ngo off and start a family, I didn't start a family. And yeah, I think that's the goal. I mean, I think- - The kids.\n- of the goals, that's one of them. - Kids not only make them\ntheir life more joyful and brings love to their life, it's also makes 'em more productive, makes 'em better people, all that. It's kind of obvious. - Yeah, I think that's\nwhat Costello wanted. I think I have this story in\nmy head that he was just like, okay, like take this. Like you could, yeah. - And don't fuck this up. - And don't, (chuckles) Lord knows, don't fuck this up. - Andrew, I love you brother. This is incredible.\n- Love you too, thank you, I appreciate you. - As we will talk often\non each other's podcast for many years to come. - Yes.\n- Many, many years to come. - Thank you, thanks for having me on here. And there are no words\nfor how much I appreciate your example and your\nfriendship, so love you brother. - I love you too. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Andrew Huberman.
