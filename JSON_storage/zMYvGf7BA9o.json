And so we have this conversation and I tell her, \"Look,\npeople are looking for me.\" \"Who?\" \"Law enforcement.\" \"Which ones?\" \"All of them,\" you know? She's like, \"That doesn't even, for what?\" I go, \"Mostly bank fraud.\" And she's like, \"Well, how\nare they not finding you? I mean, everybody, you\nknow, people know you,\" like, you know, your general contractor, which I met four months before, this guy's, six months before,\nthis was two months before, you know, she's like, \"So\nand so, so-and so, so,\" and I'm like, \"Right, right.\" Well, I said, \"Well.\" she's like, \"I mean, they've got your name, they've got your,\" I go, \"Well, that's identity theft.\" And she was like, \"What do you mean?\" I said, \"Well, my name's\nnot, you know, my name's not, it's not Joseph Carter.\" \"And what is your name?\nWhat is your name?\" I go, \"Look, you know, it's, you don't need, don't\neven worry about it.\" - The following is a\nconversation with Matthew Cox, a conman recently released\nfrom federal prison where he served 13 years for\nbank fraud, mortgage fraud, identity theft, passport\nfraud, and other charges. He has admitted guilt to all of it. He has written true crime stories of many of his fellow prisoners. And now he continues this work by interviewing criminals\nabout their crimes on his YouTube channel\nthat I recommend called, \"Inside True Crime.\" Exploring the mind of a criminal\nis exploring human nature at the extremes, often in its most raw and illuminating form. And that is something\nI definitely want to do with this podcast, to\nunderstand the human mind and everything it is capable of.

      "section": "Mortgage fraud",
      "text": "What was the first crime you committed? - The first mortgage I ever did. - [Lex] A mortgage is me\nborrowing money from a bank to buy a house.\n- Yeah. - How can you find a way\nto commit crime in this? How can you do fraud in this space? - It's very difficult for the average guy to commit fraud because there's\nso many safeguards set up. You know, if you were to go in and say, \"I make $300,000 a year.\" \"Okay, well, we want your\nW-2s, we want your pay stubs. We're gonna call your employer. We're gonna check to\nmake sure your employer, how long they've been incorporated. We're gonna check to make\nsure they're registered. We're gonna,\" it's like, ugh,\nyour whole plan fell apart. You know, because the\naverage guy can't do that. He can't even come up with\nthe, with the pay stub and W-2. So the average person, you know, or I'm gonna put down this much money, but you're gonna borrow that money from the seller, you know? Okay, well then they start\nasking for bank statements. Where did the money come from? How long has it been in your bank? Like, you can't even have it\nput in your bank for a day, get a letter, you know, it's gotta have been there\nfor 90 days or 60 days, depending on the bank. And so there's all these ways for the average person, it's\nvery difficult to commit fraud. The average guy that works at Walmart and makes $60,000 a year, and he is been there for five years and he saved his deposit. Like it's a very, that's really the guy that those transactions are set up for, to borrow a mortgage from Bank of America. That's the guy they're looking for. - So to commit fraud in this space, you have to misrepresent\nsome aspect of your identity of how much you're worth,\nhow much money you have, this kind of stuff. - Right, you have to be\nable to lie to the bank. Anytime you lie to the bank,\nyou've committed fraud. And it's funny, when I was, you\nknow, doing it, I would say, \"Ah, it's in the gray area.\" There's no gray area. You're either lying in some\ncapacity or you're not. So it's it, for instance,\nthe very first loan I did, I Wited-Out, my borrower had been 30\ndays late on her rent. So they're really looking\nat the last two years. So when you go into the bank, and they, most of what they're asking is a a two year window. They're saying, \"How long\nhave you been on their job?\" They care about two years. And how long have you\nbeen at your residency? They're looking for two years. Now, you could be at three\nplaces in two years. That's fine. As long as you consistently\npaid for two years. Well, she had been in\nan apartment complex, but she'd been 30 days late. Now she caught it up, but she was late. Bank, you know, the bank\ndoesn't want to lend you money if you've been 30 days late. So I was a broker and I\nWited-Out the 30 day late. I just got rid of it. And my manager is the person\nthat told me to do it. She said, \"It'll be fine.\" And she was right. It was. - What did it feel like? So that was the first\nfraudulent action you committed? - Yeah, I mean, you know, I was worried, you know, I always say, you\nknow, I sweated bullets for, you know, four or five days, you know, but I mean, I was concerned and I don't know that I was concerned that I had broken the law. I was concerned because I was\nbehind on my truck payment. I was behind on my mortgage. Like I had banked on\nbeing a mortgage broker. And I'd gone deep, deep behind\non all my bills to do this. So in the last minute, when\nthis loan isn't gonna close, and I have to commit\nfraud to make that happen. And the idea, my fear was\nthey were gonna figure it out and maybe I'd get fired. You know, I didn't think\nI was gonna go to jail because my manager assured\nme, you're not going to jail. Like, you'll get fired at best. So my concern was they\nwere gonna catch it, and I get fired and I wouldn't get paid. Like, I needed that money so bad. - So we'll maybe paint the picture here. Where were you working?\nWho was the manager? - The manager was, it's funny, 'cause I don't think I\never really mentioned this, her name was Gretchen Zayas. She eventually, I don't mind saying it, but she eventually got, ended\nup going to jail for fraud. Her name was Gretchen Zayas,\nand she was a manager. I was working for a company\ncalled Eagle Lending, and it was in Tampa. And this was like my first month. So it was my very first deal, three or four weeks into it,\ninto that first month. And I walk in, I put the\nfile in front of my manager. She looks through everything, you know. \"Oh, great, good, good.\" And put this one piece of\npaper over here and sat there. And then when she was done,\nI said, \"What's going on?\" She goes, \"Perfect, file's perfect.\" She goes, \"But your borrower\nwas 30 day late on her rent.\" And she says, \"That's, it's done.\" She's like, \"That's a deal killer.\" And I was like, \"Oh my gosh,\nyou know, what do I do?\" And I remember she pulled\nout a thing of Wite-Out, remember Wite-Out? Not\nthe sticks with the one. (Matt imitates scribbling) And she started going.\n(Matt imitates scribbling) And I was like, \"What?\" She goes, \"If I was you,\"\nand she handed, she said, \"I'd Wite it Out, make a copy,\nstick it back in the file.\" - Yeah.\n- She said, \"It'll be fine.\" And I went, \"I could,\" I\nwas like, that's fraud. I could go to jail.\" And she goes, and she was like, \"They're never gonna catch it.\" She said, \"Look, we do stuff,\nI do stuff all the time.\" She said, \"They're not gonna catch it, and nobody's calling the FBI.\" She goes, \"The worst case scenario, if underwriting catches\nit, then they'll fire you. That's it. Nobody's calling,\nyou're not gonna jail.\" And I was, you know, and I trusted her. I was like, \"Okay.\" And so, I did what she said.\nI stuck it in the file. And I mean, look, like I\nsaid, for four or five days, I was like, \"Oh my God,\nmy God, I'm so scared.\" - How old were you at this point? - Probably 29. I think it was 29. You know, like I had gone to college and so many things had not worked out. You know, I got a degree in fine arts. It's not a, there's not\na lot of people looking for anyone with a fine arts degree. And, you know, I tried to\nbe an insurance adjuster. Tried that for about a\nyear, year and a half. That didn't work out. Ended up working\nconstruction for a few years. And, you know, so finally\nthe girl I was dating said, \"You gotta be a mortgage broker.\" You know, she's just had just started as a mortgage in the mortgage industry. And she was like, \"You have to do this. Like, you were born to do\nthis. This is perfect for you.\" - What did she see in you? - She said, \"It just, you're a salesman.\" And I was like, 'cause\nI was like, you know, I barely balance my checkbook. Like, I don't know anything about numbers. And she's like, \"It has nothing\nto do with that. It's sales. It's putting together deals,\nyou know, you're good at that, you're good at negotiating. You're, you know, you're\na natural salesman.\" And I figured I'd, I\nneeded to try something. - So what aspect of mortgages\nis sales and deal making, what aspects require the\ncharisma that you clearly have? - Well, one, you've got, you have clients that have lots of options. They can go to Bank of America,\nthey can go to SunTrust, they can go to Chase. They have options if\nthey have perfect credit. I ended up working for a company\nthat was a subprime lender. And those people didn't\nhave a lot of options. By the time, honestly, by\nthe time they got to that, to Eagle Lending, their options were over. So what ends up happening is, you're negotiating with sellers. You know, you would think\nthat a lot of the stuff that in that industry that real\nestate agents should do, you know, the brokers end up doing because real estate agents are used to, you meet them at the house or they take you to several\nhouses, they, you know, they open the door, they walk around, they write up a contract\nthat's legit, a legit contract. And you're already pre-approved. Everything works out. But\nsubprime, that's not the case. You got borrowers with\nhorrific job history. They don't have enough\nof the down payment. They can't, maybe they\nhave the down payment, but they don't have the closing costs. So you have to go to the real estate agent and say, \"Listen, I need you\nto raise the purchase price,\" and have the seller pay the closing costs, which is legal, but\nthat's not, to a degree. But that's not how they\nwrote up the contract. So now you're having to get\nthem to rewrite the contract or you're have, you're, you know, there's little things you're trying to do. And the more, the more deals you get done, and the more you deal with\ncertain real estate agents, the more you start to\nrealize that they're, you know, you know which\nones are completely above board and which ones are\nwilling to twist the rules. - And a lot of it works\non personal relationships. - Right, right. For some reason, people tend\nto like me and trust me. - Yeah.\n- I don't know why, it hasn't worked out for so many people, but people naturally seem to trust me. And so if I say, \"Hey,\nI can close the loan, but you gotta do this, it'll be cool. Don't worry. We do it all the time. It's like my third loan. And you know, I've been\ndoing this for years.\" And they go, \"Oh, okay.\" And then they raise the purchase\nprice, they add some money, they have the seller of\nthe house give the borrower some money, they stick it in the bank, or they put it in escrow\nat the closing company. Like, now you're starting\nto massage deals. - What was the second time\nyou committed a crime? So what, how did it start\nto evolve from the Wite-Out? - Well, I mean, when that\nwent through, you know, I think a normal person\nprobably would've said, \"Wow, it was a one time\nthing, got away with it, whew, I'm good.\" But for me, it just emboldened me. Like, I just got a check for like, I don't know what it was, 25, $3,500. I was thrilled. And by that time I was already\nworking on another deal. But that guy, he made, I forget something\nlike he had made like, let's say $45,000 the\nyear before in his W-2, if you, based on his current track record or his year to date of his pay stub, he made just enough money. But if you factored in last\nyear's W-2, he was shy. So if I changed that 45,000 to 51,000, then he could, the loan closes, I get a check for 3,500 bucks. He gets into a house,\nI'm doing him a favor, you know, I'm doing God's work. So I fix it, I kick back. I'm terrified a little bit,\nyou know, worried about it. Sure enough, it closes. Four or five days later they\ncall me, he's ready to close. A week later, we close, I get a check. Next guy that comes in. I mean, I got very, very quickly, I was concerned, do you have a house? Do you have a deal? Is it ready? I can get you, I could get you done. Now if you were in\nbankruptcy or something, there's some things you\njust, you'd pull their credit and you just couldn't help them. If they were, if they\nhad a 550 credit score or something, and no job. I mean, you know, it\nhad to be within reason, but very quickly it was changing W-2s, changing pay subs, changing\nappraisals, you know, fixing, like I said,\nverifications of rent. So it evolved very quickly for me. - And you're essentially helping people. - That's what I told myself. - Giving them a chance. People that have been really\nstruggling financially in life. So you've been telling\nyourself that this is, you're doing a good thing for people. - I told myself that right up until that, those loans were solid and I was helping those people out right up until I went to prison. And I was in prison and I had to write,\nthe government asked me to write an ethics and fraud course to help teach the\nnation's mortgage brokers. You know, all loan officers and brokers have to take,\nI think it's nine hours of continuing education every single year. And I was approached to\nwrite the ethics course, and it was about that time and about the same period of\ntime I was writing a book, my book, and that kind\nof, I started reflecting on what I had done, you know? And the truth is like, and this\nis a horrible thing to say, 'cause the first time I ever\nheard somebody say this, I remember thinking, oh,\nthat's a horrible thing to say. Some people should not own a house. They shouldn't be allowed to borrow. They're not in a position\nfinancially, you know, and there were many occasions where I put someone in a house that they 100% swore they could afford. It was I was helping them. I told myself I was helping them. And a year and a half later,\nthey're going into foreclosure. Their stuff's on the corner,\nthey don't know where to go. And the truth is, is that I'm not smarter than the actuaries that came up with those underwriting guidelines. - So in this whole process,\nhow are you making money? Are you taking a percentage?\n- Broker fee. Yeah, I charge a broker fee.\nOr you charge yield spread. So yield spread is, let's say the interest\nrate is 8% interest. If I charge them 25\nbasis points over the 8%, so I charge them eight and a quarter, you know, 8.25, then I get\n1% of the loan back as a fee. So if I charge them\neight and a half percent, I get two points back. So if it's $100,000 piece of property and the bank says your\ninterest rate is gonna be 8%, and I tell you 8.5, and I'm charging you a $3,500 broker fee, now I'm making $5,500. So on even $100,000 loan, you could make a nice chunk of change. I mean, it's- - So how much gray area is here? You said that there really\nisn't when you're lying or not, but it feels like there is.\n- I mean, you're lying. But it, well, every\ntime I change something, it wasn't gray area, I just committed. - Right.\n- I just committed fraud. At this level, you're either,\nyou either meet the guidelines or someone has massaged it in such a way that they've committed\nfraud and that's it. And there's, now there's tons of ways where you can commit fraud and they just can't figure it out. Does that make sense? Like I mean, I've com\nyou've committed fraud and it's like they've\nlooked at the entire, they look at all the documents and they double check everything. And they know there's fraud in here, they just can't find it. - But just because they can't find it doesn't mean it's not fraud\n- Doesn't mean it wasn't, exactly, doesn't mean it wasn't fraud. - As part of this, you did\na lot of fascinating things. One of the things you did,\nyou talked about creating"

      "section": "Creating fake people",
      "text": "synthetic people, meaning\ncreating fake identities. What does it take to do\nthat, to do that well? - So your credit profile is\nmade up of your, you know, your name, date of birth, your address, and you know, your Social Security number. And, you know, those are\nthe kind of, you know, and then there's other things, where you work, that sort of thing. But what people don't realize is there's so many people out there that think that the credit bureaus already\nknow who you are, right? But the truth is, the first\ntime the credit bureau has ever heard about you\nwas when you told them. The first time you\napplied for a credit card, they created a credit\nprofile at that moment. Prior to that, they had no idea. So the first time you apply,\nyou give them your full name, date of birth, Social Security number and your address, and they\ncreate a credit profile and they say, \"Hey, no\nrecord found of this person. He has no credit,\" nothing\nprobably got denied. Well, what I realized\nthrough the course of, 'cause eventually I ended\nup leaving that one company and I opened my own mortgage company. When I opened that mortgage company, I was on the inside. Does that make sense? Like I wasn't just a\nbroker that was sitting out with everybody else and\nwould periodically come in and ask questions or would\ncall underwriting and, but really didn't understand\nwhat was happening and what exactly what the\nunderwriting guidelines were. Now, I was actually\ntalking to the underwriters and you're talking to the owners of the lending institutions and the banks, and you're talking to all\nof the account executives. And now it wasn't just Eagle\nLending I was talking to, there were 40 different\naccount executives coming in on a weekly basis trying\nto get us to sign up with their lender. And they're on the inside\ntelling you, coming in, showing you programs and saying, \"Look, if your\nborrower is, you know, self-employed, we don't\nask for this or this. We just ask for them to\nsay they're self-employed.\" Like liar loans, you've\nheard the term liar loans? - No.\n- Okay. No doc loans, where they don't\nask for any documentation. If he's got over like,\nlet's say a 700 credit score and he says he's been a plumber and he works for himself, then he's got over a 700 credit score. He just has to say he is worked for himself for over two years and- - They don't ask him any-\n- They don't ask for any documentation. He's got the money in the bank,\nhe's got a 700 credit score, says he is been on the job for two years, he's self-employed, we're gonna raise his interest rate by 1%. And he's got, you know, and that's it. He's got the loan. So, but you start to know how things work because I hired a bunch of\nbrokers to work underneath me, and when they would get caught,\nI would get the phone call. So I get the phone call\nfrom the owner of a banker or a lending institute,\nyou know, a lender. And that lender says, \"Hey\nMatt, we got a problem.\" I'm like, \"What's up?\" He is like, \"Listen, we\ncaught a, a fake W-2.\" I'm like, \"What do you mean?\" \"Yeah, your broker\nso-and-so sent us a file and this person had, there's two fake W-2s and we're assuming the\npay stubs are fake.\" And I'm like, \"Are you serious?\" How did you even catch that?\" And they go, \"Oh, well here's what we did. We checked with sunbiz.com,\nyou know, sunbiz.gov, which is the Secretary of State's website that registers corporations. And we checked and the tax\nID number didn't match.\" And now I know every W-2 has to have a matching tax ID number for whatever corporation issued it. - So, there's a sequence of\nchecks they do to detect fraud on different documents like W-2s. - Right.\n- And then you're slowly learning.\n- Slowly, yeah, exactly. - [Lex] What's the process for detecting? - I mean, I had a pretty\ngood understanding anyway. - Yeah.\n- But, so I'm starting to learn that-\n- It's common sense understanding, yeah.\n- So I'm putting these things together and I remember one time\nI had a woman come in and she came in and\nshe had perfect credit. She had like 750 credit\nscores. I mean, it was perfect. And she came in and one of\nthe brokers came in and said, \"Hey Matt,\" he was like,\n\"Can I show you something?\" I was like, \"Yeah, what's up?\" He goes, \"Look,\" he said, \"I've got this woman's W-2s here.\" I said, \"Okay.\" I looked at them and he goes, \"Here's your credit report.\" And he goes, \"Here's the,\nyou know, application. This is the Social Security number.\" I went, \"All right.\" And he said, \"This is the\nSocial Security number on the W-2.\" And I went, \"Okay.\" Keep in mind you go to get\na car loan or credit card. They never asked for these things. So, and he was like, and I'm really shocked he even noticed it. I probably might not have even caught it, but they were different. And I went, \"Really?\" And he goes, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"So I did, you know, she just brought them in,\nyou know, she's here.\" And I was like, \"Oh, bring her in here.\" So she came in, sat down, I said, \"Listen, here's what we just found.\" And she was like, \"Oh,\nokay. You know what? I don't want the loan, I just.\" I go, \"No, no, no, no,\" I said, \"Listen, you're getting the loan. You got a 750 credit score. Like, I don't care what we have to do. We're getting you the loan. I just wanna know what's going on. How did you get 750 credit scores under this Social Security number when clearly this is your\nreal Social Security number? You've been working for\nthis company for 10 years and your credit profile says it's only like three years old.\" And I was like, \"What happened?\" And what she told me she\ndid was she had been, she went through a divorce, she had been married for 10 years. Used her husband's, I mean\nhis surname for 10 years. So she has no credit\nunder her maiden name. But when they got divorced,\nshe switched to her maiden name because when she pulled,\ntried to get anything in her husband's surname, it was denied, bad credit. So he had bad credit,\ntheir credit went bad. So he switched to her,\nshe switched to her name and a friend told her if she\nneeded to get her electric or anything turned on,\nshe could use her name and use her daughter's or son's Social Security number, which was like a four-year-old kid. - Yep.\n- So she used that and it went through, she\nhad to put a deposit down, but it went through at\nleast, wasn't denied. So that went through. Then she went and she applied\nfor an apartment with that. Sure enough it went through. She had no credit, but they said, \"You don't have bad credit.\" So she said once she\nmoved into the apartment, she then started getting these\npre-approved credit cards. So she, she goes, but I\nknew I had applied there using my son's Social\nSecurity number, let's say. So she started filling those out and sure enough she got a\ncredit card and then she got two and then she got a pre-approval\nfrom Ford Motor Credit. She went and got herself,\na new car, got approved, she'd been making the payments ever since. She has 750 credit scores. She thought she'd try at\nbuying a house in his name, in his Social Security number. And we caught it and she\ngot a house in that name. We closed it. I just was like, wow. Like this is great. - Can I ask you a question about that? Because it seems like she's able to pay for everything.\n- Right. - So while this is highly illegal, is it unethical? Is it like, it's unethical\nin that it's messing with the system on which\na lot of people rely, but it feels like there's some aspect of the system that's broken in that it doesn't give people\nlike her a second chance. - She could have claimed bankruptcy and then two years later, listen, two years outta bankruptcy,\nyou can go into Bank of America and get a conventional mortgage, assuming you have perfect\ncredit outside the bankruptcy, you have the down payment,\nyou make enough money, there's a whole bunch of, you know, a bunch of underwriting\nguidelines you have to meet. But that's possible. But you're right. For instance, she wasn't\ngetting an apartment using, with her bad credit, she wasn't getting her\nutilities turned on. She wasn't getting any\nof those things done. - So getting your life back\non track is just harder. - It's extremely hard.\n- So there's a temptation to take the shortcut and the shortcut is often going to be illegal. - Right. And she stumbled into it. - Yeah.\n- But she basically explained it to me and I mean, I don't think she had walked\nout of my brokerage office before I went and I just started\nmaking up, you know, names and I think I went, I went\nand into our file cabinet and grabbed some people's\n1040s, which we had, you know, their tax returns and looked up children's\nSocial Security numbers and just grabbed some random\nkids' Social Security numbers and their name and went\nand pulled them and sure. And you know, but I\nchanged their date of birth to be an adult. Pulled it, and sure enough\nit came up, no file found, you know, didn't say fraud\nalert or fraud or anything. They didn't say, \"Mismatched this, mismatched that,\" didn't say anything. It just said, you know, \"No file found.\" Well then we went and we pulled, applied for a couple credit cards using a child's Social Security number. And then we went and pulled\nour own credit report and sure enough, it didn't\nsay \"No file found.\" It just said that there\nhad been two inquiries applying for credit cards. So I was like, wow, like\nthat's a credit profile. So that turns into me going to Social Security and calling\nor calling Social Security and trying to get them to issue\nme Social Security numbers to adults that had never had a Social Security number issued to them. I need to get Social Security number to give me a clean Social Security number. But I called up and of course, you know, I'm a novice, I don't\nreally know what I'm doing. So I call up and I say, \"Hey, yeah, I never had a Social\nSecurity number issued.\" And they were like, \"How old are you?\" And I was like, \"I'm 31\nyears old,\" you know? And they were, \"Yeah, that's not possible. Do you have a driver's license?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You have a bank account?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You have a Social Security number. Bring your driver's license in\nand we'll, we'll pull it up.\" Okay, well that's not gonna\nhappen. Hang up, call back. \"Hi, my son is seven years\nold or three years old and he never had a Social\nSecurity number issued.\" \"Oh, okay. Was he born in a hospital?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, he has one. He has one. Go ahead and get your son, come in here.\" No, I'm not doing that.\nHang up, call back. So I called back probably 10 times and eventually someone\nsaid, I kept altering it, kept altering what I was\nsaying till I got to the point where I was saying, \"My\nson was born with a midwife not in the hospital. And the pediatrician told\nus that we needed to go, we need to get Social Security to issue a Social Security number.\" And they would say, \"Well,\nhe should have issued it. But that does happen sometimes. So bring your son in and we'll, you know, you\ncan fill out the paperwork, we'll have one issued, you\nknow, first we'll check to see he never had one issued and if he hasn't we'll issue one.\" And so then it turned into, \"My son is out of the\ncountry and I need this.\" And then that turned into, \"Oh, I'm sorry. Well, how old is he?\" I was like, \"You know, he's three.\" And they go, \"Well, I'm sorry, if he's over the age of 12\nmonths old, he has to come in.\" Hang up the phone, call back. \"My son is 10 months old,\nhe's out of the country, born with a midwife, never\nhad a Social Security number.\" And then they go, \"Oh, okay, that's fine. Just get his birth certificate\nand his shot record and you can come in,\nfill out the paperwork, we'll issue you a Social Security number.\" And that's what I did. So I figured out how to\ncreate a birth certificate. You know, I ordered the\nsecurity paper, you know, when, where you make a copy, it says, you know, \"Void if copied.\" So I ordered, had to\norder a bunch of that, and I went online and figured out how to make a fake birth certificate. It was great too, 'cause\nlike the county actually, they give you a blank form and then they actually show you what it looks like filled out like a handwritten one filled out. So I knew if he was born\nthis day, he got these shots. Two months later he got these shots. Six months later he got these shots. So I just filled it out. I\neven had to order a seal. So you have to have a seal that says like, \"Hillsborough County Vital Statistics\" or \"Richland County Vital\nStatistics,\" or something. And I couldn't get anybody to make that. So I changed it to like\n\"Richland County Office of Virtual Records.\" And then I took like 220 grit\nsandpaper and hit it over and over and over again to wear it down. And then I, you know, I did the embossment on the corner and, you know, I printed it on the\nsecurity paper, embossed it. Nobody looks at those things. You could see Richland County, you know, you could kind of see that. And then really they just grab it and they go like this,\nthis is what you realize after you, when started getting\ndriver's licenses issued by the state DMV, right? The state, I figured out\neventually it was easier to just go into the DMV\nand have them give me a driver's license than actually make one. So, but you notice they\nwould just grab the thing, they'd feel the form and go, \"Okay.\" Like they don't even look at it. So, which is upsetting if you put as much work into these\ndocuments as I am for them to go, \"Okay, yeah, that's\ngood, sit over there.\" I felt like going like, \"Hey bro.\" - Yeah.\n- \"Like take a look at this. This is artwork.\"\n- Yeah, but they're looking for\nthe low hanging fruit of crappy fraud.\n- Right, yeah. This stuff was right through. So. - Okay, so birth certificate gets you a Social Security number. So it's interesting 'cause you've also, you've done a lot of different approaches to\ncreating synthetic people. There's homeless people involved. So sometimes it's grounded in real people or real names and then you're- - Right.\n- Like some part is fake, some part is real sometimes, and sometimes it's completely all fake. - Right, 'cause now I have the name, I have the Social Security number. And what's great is they mail you, what's even better is\nyou get, then you get to pick whatever name you want, you know, 'cause when you pick your child's name, he doesn't even have\nto have your last name, you pick any name. So I would pick a name and I'd just say, \"Oh, my\nwife's last name is this.\" If they questioned it,\nwhich they never did. But, you know, I've got\na Social Security number. And then I would go apply for credit cards and I'd get denied of course. But they would all offer\nme a secured credit card. So I'd then fill out\nthe secured credit card and I'd send them, send\nthe bank the money, and they would give me a\nsecured credit card for $500, $300, 1,000, whatever it was. And then once you start\nmaking the payments, I pulled the credit and a\ncredit profile shows up saying that this 31-year-old man with\nthe Social Security number that I know was issued, you know, a couple months ago\nhas three credit cards. They don't even say secure. They just say there's like,\nthis credit card is $500. It was issued by Bank of America. This one was issued by\nCapital One, this one. So I've got three of them,\nbut I had no credit scores. So at that point I kind\nof kicked back and waited and I just kept making payments. And I remember thinking to\nmyself, I'll bet you they don't, that the credit bureaus\ndon't generate credit scores for at least a year. And I was like, God, this is\ngonna be a year long process. And while that was\nhappening, I started other, I was starting other ones. 'Cause I figured at least\nin a year I'll have a bunch of these secure, you know, these, we call them like phantom borrowers, but now they call them\nsynthetic identities. So at least I would have\nthese synthetic identities and maybe I could do something with them. But what happened was,\nat six months I went and I randomly pulled the\nguy's credit, you know, the person's credit and\nthey had 705 credit scores, 705, 701, 695. I was like, \"Oh my God,\" you\nonly needed a 620 to borrow to get a 95% loan from the bank. So I was like, \"Oh my\nGod, this is amazing.\" Sure enough, a month later,\nthe other ones I had started all of them, bam, bam, bam. - So what do you do\nwith a phantom borrower? Like what, how do you make money on this? - So I think most people, if\nyou were just like a scammer, a fraudster, you would\nprobably just get credit cards and maybe build up that\nhistory or maybe try and borrow a personal loan,\nwhich is limited, you know, personal loans are used\nto be, you used to be, you could go to an FDIC insured\nbank, which borrows money. Those, you know, the\npersonal loans they lend out at the max $15,000, you\nknow, so you could do that. - So, you can go through\nthis whole process of creating a fake identity,\ngetting a card, paying it off, building up credit, and then you get $15,000 at the end or something>\n- Right, you get 15 maybe, you know, if you wanna\nkeep making the payments, you know, if you could wait a year, you could probably get 15,000. Maybe you could maybe get 20, 30,000 and a bunch of little smaller\nones, you know, you get 7,500. 'cause I did, I know did, there\nwas a $7,500 from Citibank, you know, $5,500 from American General. So you maybe get, what, 25,000, you know, maybe 30,000 in personal loans. Maybe you can, you could,\nyou could then apply for, you could maybe get another 20 or 30,000 in regular credit cards. You know, 10,000 here, 8,000, 5,000. And then you go to the\nlower department store cards and you go to Home Depot,\nyou get 1,000, you get 500. So it ends up being maybe\nyou can get 50, 60,000, maybe if you're really\ngood, you could get up to 80 or $100,000 in credit cards and personal loans if you really knew what you were doing. But.\n- Per person, per identity. - Per identity. But I had the ability to leverage that perfect, those\nperfect credit profiles against properties. And I mean, ultimately\nthat's what I end up doing. And so each one of those\nidentities was worth, you know, a few million. - Can you explain how that works? So to leverage them against property, so how does that work with a mortgage? - So what I did, yeah,\neventually, I mean, this was like, is down the road, but you know, I mean at this point when things are just, my whole life had kind\nof gone off the rails. I was on federal probation. And so what I did, decided what I was gonna do was\nstart running a scam, a much larger scam. And what I was going to do was, I was gonna start flipping\nproperties, right? Like buy houses cheap,\nfix them up and sell them. There's an area of Tampa called Ybor City. So I was gonna start\nflipping houses in Ybor City. And you know, I thought,\nokay, I can buy these houses for, you could buy a really\ncrappy house at that time for 50, $60,000, let's say 50. And then you could put $25,000\ninto it in renovations. You could renovate it for 25 and maybe you could get an\nappraisal for a hundred. So I thought what I could do is, I can buy these houses, renovate them and sell them to, you\nknow, regular people. But I also had been working\non the synthetic identities. And then I thought, well,\nor I could just sell them to synthetic identities and then I wouldn't have to\ndump 25,000 into it, right? And these guys are perfect.\nThey have perfect credit. I can provide W-2s and pay stubs because by this point I'm\nmanufacturing businesses. So I've got, I've incorporated businesses, I've got websites for the\nbusinesses, W-2s, pay stubs. So these guys have,\nthese guys look perfect. So I figure I'll buy these\nproperties for 50,000, sell it to these guys for a hundred. Maybe I'll pocket 40 or 50,000. I don't really have to do anything. But that seemed shortsighted. So I thought what'd be even better is that if I did a little bit of renovations and then I sold it for much higher, maybe I put 10,000, clean\nup the outside of it. 'cause these guys don't\ncare what the inside of the property looks like. You know, they don't exist. So, but I can't, how am\nI gonna get an appraisal for $100,000? Well, do you, you know\nhow appraisals work? Okay, so the bank sends\nit an appraisal out, or at that time you could\nprovide an appraisal and they can review it. So they'll do what's\ncalled a desktop review. They review it, they\nreview it on the computer, and they never go out to the property. Or they send someone out. They call that, you know,\nit's like a field review. They send someone out and\nthey just look at the house. They don't go in it though. So I have to clean out the, clean up the outside of the house. So what I did was, but the\nproblem is if your house is, you're trying to sell that\nhouse for let's say 200,000, the other houses, they have\nto pick three comparable sales in the area that are also going to support a $200,000 sales price. Well, there's no other houses selling for 200,000 near this house. So I thought if I wanna get\nthese things appraised for 200, 250,000, I have to have comparable sales. And that appraisal's going to be reviewed. So what I did was I started, I went out and I bought\nthis house for 50,000 and, I recorded the sale at 200,000. So when you buy a house for $100,000, you pay $700 in doc stamps. But if you pay the extra,\nan extra 700 bucks, the sale shows up for 200,000. I'm buying these things for 50. So I'm paying $350 and I'm just paying an extra $1,050. So it ends up being, you know, $1,400. But the sale shows up\nat 200,000 on a house that's a crack house I bought for $50,000. Now I go, I trim the\ntrees, we mow the yard, we clean up the porch, we\nput the porch rail on maybe, we paint it real nice. We black out all the windows,\nyou can't see inside. But from the curb, it looks great. And I get an appraisal. So\nI do that with that house. I do that within another\nhouse all within a mile. So I buy four houses\nknowing I could use the all, there's a subject and three\ncomparables for all of them. So the first thing I did is I\nbought four houses for 50,000, 60,000, 40,000. And I recorded the values\nat, you know, 210, 200, 190. So I get an appraiser to come\nout there, he appraises it, he says, of course, he\nsays, \"It's horrible, but there's comparables here.\" Now of course it is in bad shape. And he says it's in bad shape. But I go ahead and I correct\nall that, so I correct it. So now if you review the appraisal and you're in California, or even if you drive your car down, the appraiser comes to the house and looks at it from the\nstreet, it looks fine. But the truth is I've got\n$60,000 into this property and you're appraising it for 200,000. So the bank's ready to not,\nthey're not gonna lend 200, but they'll lend 190. So the bank is ready to lend this synthetic borrower $190,000 on a house that I have 60,000 in. So I walk, so I schedule a closing and we close on the house\nand I walk away with $60,000. You know, and the thing\nis, like, the problem was, is by the time I got to this point, I knew so many people in the industry. Nobody had to really\nat that point show up. Although I've had people show up for the synthetic identities and sign for them, almost all the closings,\nnobody ever showed up. I just showed up and said to\nthe title, to the title agency and said, \"Hey, my borrower,\nhe's at work right now. He can't make it, can I just take the file and I'll have him sign all the documents at his work and I'll bring them back. He's like an hour and\na half away from here, I'll be back in two or three hours.\" And they're like, \"Oh wow, that, man, Matt, thank you so much.\" And they would give it\nto me and I'd go sit in the parking lot and\nI'd sign all the documents and I'd wait an hour or\ntwo and I'd come back in and say, \"Here you go.\" - How were you able to\nkeep all this in your mind? 'Cause you have to not slip up in any of these conversations. - It's pretty easy for me to keep them everything in the correct category. Does that make sense? Like, I'm not great at a lot of things, but this I was very good at. - But well there's these\nphantom people that exist and they were becoming real\npeople in your mind as in like, you're able to tell good stories\nwith those people, right? Like, because if you're\ntalking to the appraiser, if you're talking to the\neverybody in involved, - Well, keep in mind the appraiser almost never meets the borrower. Never. Not even almost. Like 99.99, 99% of the\ntime they never meet them. - [Lex] But you have to talk about them. - Yeah. - So I guess what I'm\nasking is you're able to converse fluently about\nthese synthetic identities. - Yeah, they all had different jobs. They all had, all the jobs were basically, they were all on the job for five years. They were all, it was, a lot of it was-\n- Yeah, sure, there's a template.\n- Yeah, exactly. But.\n- Yeah, got it. - You know, listen, all matter of fact, almost every one of them\nhad the same birthdate, you know, so, because\nI, you know, who knows? There's, so yeah, it wasn't difficult. And keep in mind, a lot of the brokers barely ever meet the bar. They call in on the phone,\nbut it didn't matter anyway, 'cause I'm walking in saying, \"I got a slam dunk deal for you.\" And they're like, \"Oh wow,\nMatt, you got the W-2s, the pay stubs, you've got all the, you've got all their rental history, you have everything done. It's perfect. Thank you so much.\" They're happy to do it. \"Hey, I print up the docs and\nI'll have them go sign it.\" \"Great. Wow, thank you.\" You know, assuming they\ndidn't already know about it and almost everybody involved in this, by the time I was done, was\ninvolved, there was probably 15 or 20 people that all\nknew it was going on. - The full of it. They knew the full depth of it. - Yes. Yeah, maybe not 100% everything, but they definitely knew this is fraud. - And they were still going along with it. - Yeah. Yeah. Keep in mind that even when,\nI'll give you an example. One of my, you know, let's take, and this happened with almost all of them, was he would buy five houses. So the guy buy, what\nhappens, the basic design was I buy the houses, I\nrecord the values higher, and this person buys all five houses, refinances them, he ends up borrowing a little bit over $1\nmillion dollars in his name. Then of course, then I go and I get personal loans\nfrom several banks. I get credit cards, I run\nup all of his credit cards. By this point I've got 10, $20,000 worth of credit cards in the guy's name. So the guys are all worth like\na million, million in change. Well, once I stop paying, you start getting letters from the collection companies, right? From the banks, you know,\nand then they sell them off. So after about three months,\nyou're getting tons of letters. And what I would do is I\nwould take my borrower's name, I would go online and I would find, or I'd go in the newspaper I would find an article about, let's say like a 12 car pile up. You know, so there's, you know, this huge accident on I four. It's very dangerous. So there's a 12 car pile up and someone in the\naccident was life flighted to Tampa General Hospital. I would cut and paste that article and I would just insert my borrower's name into the article saying that, you know, Brandon Green was life flighted to Tampa General Hospital's\ncurrently in critical condition. I would then print that\narticle out on newsprint. I then make a copy of the,\ncut it up, make a copy of the newsprint, highlight his name, and I would write a letter\nfrom Brandon Green's fictional sister to the\ncollection companies saying, \"Several months ago, my brother was in a horrible car accident. He is currently,\" they've got the article, they have the highlighted name. He clearly was in this accident. He is currently in a coma. And the doctors say even if\nhe wakes up from the coma, he will never work again. That you know, so you might\nas well just foreclose on, stop writing us letters\nand take the houses back. And that's all they're\nlooking for is a reason. At this point, even if they\nlook into Brandon Green, they can't figure out if\nhe's a real person or not because he's got a Social Security number. He's got, and everything\nwent bad at the same time. He's got multiple rental properties or his primary residence. All of his credit cards went\nbad. Everything went bad. We have an excuse, we have\na letter, that happens. People get divorced, they lose their job, they get in accidents, it's reasonable. - When they look into it,\nit all looks legitimate. - Even if they ordered another appraisal, by this point it's not\nfour comparable sales or three or four comparable sales. By this point, it's like\n10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 'cause I kept making more\nand more of these guys. - What was your, just a,\nalmost like a tangent. What's your thinking process? There's a lot of cleverness going on here. So like the car pile up as a solution, the newspaper and you mail it. What, are you sitting there\nalone and thinking through this? Like how do you come up with that idea? It's a very interesting, a\nvery clever, innovative idea. - So at first, I thought about making like a fake death certificate\nand he died, you know? But I thought, \"Oh, I don't\nknow, like what if, you know, like some of these places\nhad like, you know, primary mortgage insurance, like what if the primary\nmortgage insurance, like what if they try and\nclaim 'cause he was dead or like, I don't know,\nI don't know that side. So I'm like, ugh, I don't wanna do that.\" I wanna do something\nthat's semi verifiable and third party, it's like a third party telling you this is what happened. I thought, well, like the\nnewspaper, you know, and you know, or do I claim bankruptcy? And I've done that, I've gone and got the bankruptcy forms, right? You can go to bankruptcy court and they'll give you forms to mail to all of your creditors\nand you mail them. They stop contacting and\nthey wait to be no located by or notified by the bankruptcy court. But my fear there is, you know, nobody's ever gonna notify them. Like, I'm not going through bankruptcy for one of these guys. So it was like, this is a better bet than just writing a letter saying, \"I'm going through a divorce. My wife's keeping those\nhouses. That's her problem.\" You know, you could do, there's\nlots of things you could do, but to me this was, they're not gonna try. And how do you shut it\ndown without him dying? How do you shut that down?\nThis is how you shut it down. He's in a coma. He'll never work again. He was in a car accident. Here's the proof, he can't even write you. I'm his sister. I wrote you the letter. - [Lex] It's a one time letter\nthat seems to tie up all - Tie, exactly.\n- Loose ends. - Exactly. You know, I don't know exactly how that, you know, what sparked\nthat as much as there were so many other avenues that I\ncould have gone that I was, I just didn't know I was-\n- But you were thinking through all those different avenues. - Yeah.\n- Are you mostly thinking alone?\n- I mean, you know, I had guys that I was bouncing- - Ideas from.\n- Ideas off of, there were other guys that were involved in the scam, you know, everybody. I think that scam ended up making like, I think the FBI said, it was like 11 and a half\nmillion or something. And you know, but there were so many other\npeople that were involved in that scam that were, you\nknow, this guy's getting 50, this guy's getting 20, you\nknow, 17,000, 20,000, 25,000. And you know, we're just\ndoing it constantly. And so the bank would\nforeclose on that property. They'd take it back, they'd\nput it back on the MLS, they put it back on the MLS for a hundred, for 200,000 it wouldn't sell. Then they'd drop it to, you\nknow, 150 wouldn't sell. Then they'd drop it to\n125, 130, wouldn't sell. They'd drop it to 90 and\nsomebody buy it for like 90. It wasn't worth 90. But by that point, that\nwhole area had, we'd done so many houses at that point,\nthe whole area shot up. And the FBI said we did 109 houses. I don't think that's true, but. - Wow.\n- When I end up leaving Tampa after that scam falls apart and the FBI shows up, \"Forbes\"\ncame out with an article, whatever six months later, and they said that the Ybor City zip code was one of the top 20 fastest\ngrowing appraising areas in the country. And, you know, everybody\nwas like, \"Oh, that's Matt, 'cause this place is a dump. Like this is a horrible\nplace, like this is.\" And I remember one time\nI had talked to a guy, you know, years later and he was like, \"Ah, all the comparable\nsales have dried up. Like when you left, there was just nothing\neven close to 200,000.\""

      "section": "Arrested by FBI",
      "text": "- You mentioned right\nbefore telling the story of this elaborate scam that you were on federal probation. How did that happen? - So I mentioned that I\nowned the mortgage company. - Yes.\n- Right, so I had started a mortgage company, I had maybe\na dozen guys working for me. And there was fraud. You know, like I would\nsay it wasn't all fraud, but whatever, 60, 70% of it was fraud that was going in there. And from the outside of that business, it looked very legitimate. You know, we were an FHA approved lender. We were a VA approved lender. We did conventional,\nprobably signed up with 40 or 50 subprime lenders. But there was a considerable\namount of fraud. And, you know, it kept getting, you know, it became a game, right? You know, you start, I started getting just\nmore and more creative. Like I said, every time I\nwould get away with something, like, you become emboldened by it, it's like, nice, you know, like, hey, the underwriter's looking for this and looking for this. And you sit there and go,\n\"Man, so that she's, you know, that's what am I gonna do, what am I? You know what we could do? We could create our own bank.\" \"What?\" \"Yeah. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go on, like how do they know if this bank exists? These people are in California,\nthey're in New York. Like they don't know. So what we're gonna do is,\nwe're gonna go online,\" and keep in mind this is 2000,\nyou know, this is 2000, 2001. Like this is, the Internet's in its infancy still, right? So we figure out, I remember GoDaddy, I think had just come up with a site where you could build your own website. Like how cool is that? So I go online with a buddy of mine and we create something\ncalled the Bank of Ybor. You know, we cut and pasted things that we like from other banks and we got a one 800\nnumber you could call, or a 186 number, whatever it was. And you could call it, and\nit would go to a voicemail. And so we set up this bank and then I ended up\nmaking bank statements, which by this point I already had been making bank statements to prove someone has their down payment. 'Cause a lot of times people,\nthey have good enough credit to borrow 95% or 90%, but they don't have their down payment. So we'd raise the\npurchase price high enough to cover their five or 10% down payment, and we would bring their\ndown payment for them. Or we'd have the owner of the house bring the\ndown payment for them. And then we would have a check cut out of the closing statement to a construction company that I owned. And we get our money back. So they get into the house\nfor 100% financing, or 110%. Some of them turned into 130. We wanna pay off their car,\ngive them an incentive to sign. They don't have, still don't\nhave the money to buy it. So we are doing all\nkinds of insane things. Well, at some point, remember Gretchen Zayas, my old manager? - Yeah. The original, OG.\n- Yes. She came and worked for me\nfor a short period of time, and then she and her husband went and opened their own mortgage company, which you should have known\nit was gonna be fraudulent from the get-go because it\nwas called Creative Financing. It was, yeah, CFM, creative Finance. No, creative, it was-\n- Creative was in the name. - Yeah. Yeah. Creative was in the name. - [Lex] Oh boy. - So.\n- It's really on the nose. - So she's doing very well. And we became very close by the way, where we'd go on vacation,\nwent to Puerto Rico together. I got married at the time.\nI got, I was married. Our kids, you know, play together. We babysit, we go to each other's parties. We're close, we're good friends. And she's got her own mortgage company. She calls me up periodically and asks me, \"Hey, can you make a W-2? Or Hey, can you make me a pay stub?\" \"Sure, no problem.\" We're friends. That's what\nfraudulent friends do. So, you know, if I needed\nsomebody to verify rent or verify somebody's rental history or employment, she had cell\nphones she would answer, that sort of thing for me. Well, what ends up happening is, she gets in trouble. She starts doing fraudulent\nloans for some guys, you know, and these guys are doing\nwhat's called a cashback scam. So they're getting like a\nhalf a million dollar loan on a house that's worth $300,000. So they're getting,\nthey're buying the house for whatever, 600,000. It's really only worth 300, 350. But she happened to be in an\narea where she could get it, the appraisal jacked up. So they buy the house,\nthey get two, $300,000 back and it's a straw man scam, right? It's a cash back straw man scam. So this is a real person\nthat's buying the house. He's got perfect credit,\nbut he's willing to let, to ruin his credit to get a couple hundred\nthousand in his pocket. So he never has any intentions. So it's not a synthetic identity, it's not a stolen identity. It's a straw man, he's a fake kind of a, not a fake person, but\nhe is just a straw man. He's a stand-in, so he stands\nin, he signs the paperwork, he buys the house. They end up getting 2, 300,000. Well, this guy buys like five houses. So it is two, $3 million. They've lost 5, 600, 6, $700,000. And these guys never even\nmake the first payment. They just let them go into foreclosure. So the bank immediately investigates and realizes this is fraud. So the FBI comes in, they\ngrab Pete and Gretchen. She has to hire an attorney, of course. And she doesn't get thrown\nin jail or anything. They just come to their office and they tell them they're\ninvestigating them. They know what's going on\nand they wanna talk to, they're like, \"Well,\nlook, we wanna talk to you and you're going to be indicted.\" Okay, so she comes to me,\nwell actually Pete came to me and said, \"Look man, can\nyou refinance our house and get a 75,000 out to pay our attorney?\" I said, \"No problem.\" Gretchen gives me W-2s, pay stubs fake. The whole thing's fake. I get her, I refinance, I get a second mortgage\non her house, $75,000. They pay their attorney. Their attorney immediately says, \"you need to wear a wire on this guy. Like, he just got you $75,000. You know, I don't know\nhow you got $75,000.\" The, the attorney knows something's wrong, 'cause the attorney's like, they just, \"Your whole mortgage\ncompany was just shut down. There's no way you could borrow $75,000.\" So he is like, \"This guy's\ndoing fraudulent stuff.\" And she says, \"Yes, of course he is.\" And he says, \"You need to work with the FBI, wear a\nwire against this guy.\" So she calls me one day and says, \"Listen, I gotta talk to you. The FBI's asking questions about you.\" And I go, \"What?\" And she goes, \"Yeah.\" And I was like, \"Meet me at a\npizza place down the street.\" So, you know, don't come into my office, 'cause everybody knows\nshe's been indicted. Like everybody in her\noffice quit when the FBI, if the FBI shows up and\ngives you a business card and announces they're\nthe FBI, everybody quits. So I said, \"Don't come here.\" 'Cause they already know,\nthey're already concerned. So I go and I meet her and Pete and we sit down at a restaurant, you know, a little pizzeria. And I sit down and she starts telling me that the FBI's asking questions about me. And I'm like, \"Well, what\nare you talking about? Like, what are they asking?\" And she goes, \"Look, they came\nin, they took all our files.\" And like, I was like, \"I\ndidn't know any of this. I'm like, when did this happen?\" She's like, \"Yeah, they\nhave a couple weeks ago. And they have some of your files.\" 'Cause I had closed several loans for my wife at the time. We were buying rental properties.\nMy wife didn't have a job. So they're, it's all fraud. But I couldn't close, I\ncould not close those loans in at my mortgage company\nbecause I owned the property. So I'm selling those properties. I bought properties, renovated them and sold them to my wife to get around something called seasoning. Seasoning says you have to\nwait six months to a year to refinance at the market value. Otherwise you, if you wanna\nrefinance, that's fine, but you have to refinance at the price you\npurchased the property at. But I bought these properties for 80 or 100,000, renovated\nthem, sold them for 2, 300,000 to my, my wife who got a very, didn't even get a big mortgage. We were just trying to kind\nof get around a guideline. So, but my wife was not working and I provided W-2s and pay stubs. So when she says all\nthis, she says, \"Yeah, they're looking at the loans you gave me, at your wife's loans.\" And I went, \"Oh my God.\" I said, \"Well, you didn't tell them that the W-2s were fake, did you? You didn't tell them the pay\nstubs were fake, did you? You didn't tell them that\nthe down payments were, you didn't tell them that\nwe were married, did you?\" I mean, just absolutely buried myself. - Yeah.\n- And as I'm telling her this, I was like, okay, I was\nlike, I kind of caught myself and I'm, \"Okay, wait, wait, wait a minute. Look, okay, here's what\nyou're gonna tell them. You are going to tell\nthem you never met her. She called on the phone.\" Like, I start trying to devise a plan that will answer their questions without getting my wife in\ntrouble or them in trouble. And if nobody cooperates, the\nwhole thing should shut down. You know, they, it doesn't go anywhere. There's no way, there's\nnowhere for them to go if everybody just kind of stonewalls them. So, as I'm saying all this, Gretchen says, \"Matt, we can't lie to the FBI.\" And I go, \"What are you talking about? You're already lying to the\nFBI mean, you, you know, you've been lying to the FBI, I mean, I just refinanced your house.\" And before I can really say\nanything, Pete jumps up, her husband stands up, and he says, 'We've never lied to the FBI. We may not have told them\neverything, but we've never lied.\" And I thought, like,\nwho are you talking to? Like, I know that's not true. So you're not saying that for my benefit. So I was just, I kind of look\nat them and I'm like, \"What?\" And I just, I remember looking down and this may mean nothing, but both of their cell\nphones were right next to me. Right? And I remember they were\nprobably just wearing wires, but I just remember thinking those cell phones are microphones. - Yeah.\n- They probably weren't. But I remember thinking, oh, wow. And I just, I looked at\nit and I went, \"Wow.\" And I said, \"Well, I hope you're gonna get something for this.\" And she immediately starts crying and she says, \"Matt, I'm sorry. I have a kid. I can't go to jail.\" - Do you have kids at that point? - Yeah. I like, I have a\nkid. Like I have a kid. And I was like, \"Wow. I, wow.\" - What have you learned\nabout friendship from that? Like, loyalty? - Oh yeah, there's no, there's, that's a, that's, it's sweet. - That must have hurt.\n- It's cute. I mean, I love the idea of it. - You don't think that?\n- No. I'll tell you why. So I go back to my office. I remember I told her, I said, \"Tell the FBI agent to\ncall me on the phone. Do not come in my office.\" So I go back, I'm still trying to figure out how to weather this, right? I go back, I sit down, phone rings, my secretary comes in and says, \"Hey agent, I'll never\nforget the guy's name, agent Scott Gale with the FBI.\" And I was like, \"Okay, he's on the phone.\" And she's standing there. I was like, 'Close the door,\nlike get out and close it.\" She's like. So get on the phone. He asked me if I'll come down. I said, \"Yeah, absolutely. Let's schedule it for next Tuesday.\" You know, I put it off four or five days. I go to my brother-in-Law\nimmediately, who's a lawyer. And he says, \"Oh, yeah, yeah,\" I don't really tell him exactly what's going on, but I tell him this is what's happening, kind of. And I may be in trouble, I need\na federal defense attorney. I don't even know what a federal defense, I don't even know the difference. But he said, \"You need a\nfederal defense attorney. It's the FBI.\" So we go on a couple, we\nmeet a couple lawyers. I end up getting a lawyer.\nI give him like 75 grand. And he started to have me convinced, initially he had me convinced I was probably gonna go to jail for a few years. But really that's what they kind of do to justify you giving them $75,000. - Right.\n- And then, but the more I thought about\nit, you know, and read, he gave me the guidelines that supposedly I had, you know, the fraud that I had\ncommitted and what the guide and the guidelines that oversaw that. And I read it and I was like,\nI'm not really in trouble here because I'm looking at a felony, but I'm not gonna go to jail\nbecause there was no potential for the bank to lose money. So, because I bought the house with like a hard money loan, and then I renovated it with my own cash. And when I sold it, it\nappraised at 250,000. My ex-wife borrowed like 180. So there's plenty of equity. If the whole thing had\ngone into foreclosure, they still would've got their money back. And to be honest, by the\ntime all this happened, there was only like three\nof the three properties. It was like five. But\nwe'd already sold a few. And at this point, we'd\njust sold another two. There's like one or two properties left. So we're selling, at that\nmoment we were selling them. So I was like, no, I\nkind of argue with him. But then he wanted 75\ngrand. I gave him 75 grand. And then he comes back\nand he says, good news, there was no potential fraud. So I can get you three years. Now here's the thing, here's what I always kind of look back at. When I first went into\nhis office, he said, he said, \"Listen, you\nhaven't been indicted yet. I spoke with the FBI spoke\nwith the US Attorney, they believe, and they've been told,\" and he said, \"Look, they\ndidn't tell me exactly what they have, but they\nsaid with the evidence that they have on you based on\ntwo confidential informants, that it's, you cannot go to trial.\" And I was like, \"Right,\"\nof course I knew that. And I was like, okay. He said, \"But,\" he said, \"You\nhaven't been indicted yet. And they are fairly certain\nthat you're running a mill. Right? A fraud mill over there. And that you guys are\nchurning out fraudulent loans. Now they can't come and they\ncan't come and raid your office and do anything about it yet, 'cause so far they only have you. But here's what I'm\nsaying is that,\" he said, \"I can keep you from being indicted. It's called pretrial, is\na pretrial intervention where we go in and what we'll do is you go, you work, you go in, talk to the\nFBI, you go grab a bunch of your mortgage brokers'\nmost egregious files, grab them, bring those files to the FBI, go work with the FBI,\nthey will indict them and you will not be indicted.\" And I said, which I\nkick myself to this day. I said, \"Absolutely not. I'm\nnot gonna snitch on them. I'm not gonna cooperate,\nI'm not going to, you know, I'd seen the godfather, you're\nnot supposed to cooperate. You're supposed to be loyal and I'm not gonna do any of that.\" And it, you know, and so I say all of this where, you know, looking back like I would've, if I could go back in time, I would've gone into our\nweekly meeting with a dolly and I would've walked\nin front of everybody and scooped up two or\nthree of the file cabinets and put them in the back of a truck and said, \"Listen, you\nguys are gonna be talking to the FBI soon, I suggested\nyou get attorneys.\" And I would've driven,\ndriven off. But I didn't. I thought, no, be loyal.\nYou know, don't do that. And what happened was, when the other thing falls apart, right? When the next scam falls apart,\nevery one of these people go to the FBI, like, they're\nnot even coming to them. These guys are going to\nthe FBI with lawyers. \"I wanna cooperate. I wanna\ntell you what Cox did. I want to help, I want to,\" and I'm thinking like I\nnever had to get indicted to begin with. - So you think that most of these people from your\nexperience, are going to sacrifice all integrity. That's a funny word, sacrifice. - [Matt] Sure, that applies\nto this. But that's- - Right. - They're going to sacrifice friendships and loyalty for just to\nsave them their own ass. - Yeah, I only had one person that did not talk to the FBI. I had one person that every time the FBI or the Secret Service went to\nthat person's door, she said, \"Don't come to my house again. I don't have anything to say about Matt. I have nothing to do with any\nof this. Talk to my lawyer.\" And this happened over and over again. And that's my ex-wife. She's a gangster."

      "text": "- So are there people in\nthis world you trusted or you still trust? - I, you know, the problem is eventually I cooperate. And at the time I didn't wanna cooperate. I didn't believe in cooperation. But after seeing how many people cooperate and the way the system is set up, I think that my understanding of loyalty is vastly more realistic now. And I think that if you\nare committing crime, if you are absolutely\nlike the things I did, I did a bunch of scumbag\nthings, you know, I mean, I'm not killing people, but\nI'm doing scumbag things. I'm lying, cheating,\nstealing that, I'm a thief. You know, you boil down\nto it. That's what I am. So you can't go around\nbehaving like a scumbag, dealing with scumbags and then expect those same\nscumbags to suddenly abide by some kind of a street code\nand not roll over on you. You know? And it does happen. But it's like in the,\nit's in the 90 percentile of people that cooperate\n90 something percent. And people cooperate when they're not even\nlooking at any real time. So if you're looking at\n30 years and especially after going to prison, you go to prison and it's like, this guy's\na standup guy over here. He got 30 years. He could have cooperated against\nall of his co-defendants, but he didn't, nobody comes to see him. His wife divorced him. You know, his kids\nended up in foster care. His, you know, his friends are\nare cleaning out his house. Nobody puts money on his books. Nobody comes to see him. Nobody\nanswers his phone. Nothing. He took 30 years. Most of those guys turned around, they end up getting\nindicted for other things. Years later, they cooperate. And the best thing this\nguy's got going for him is that he can walk around and\nsay, well, he's a standup guy. That guy's going to the\nsame halfway house as me. He's probably, he's gonna do\n30 years where I'm gonna do 10. - A standup guy, meaning\nhe never snitched. - [Matt] Right. - And so everybody's seeing this example and saying, well, I'm\ngoing to snitch then. But it sounds like what people are doing\nis they're signaling, virtue signaling, like there\nare, they would never snitch and actually do secretly. - I mean, what is it? I remember I talked to one of the COs at the prison one time, and he said, I said, \"Shit,\" I said, \"50%\nof the guys here snitched.\" He goes, \"It's more than that.\" He said, \"But listen, he goes,\" 100% of them are lying about it.\" He said, \"So you'll,\" he\ngoes, \"There's nobody here that's gonna tell you\nthey snitched, nobody.\" So there's guys, tons\nof them that cooperate. If 80, 90% of defendants cooperate, you know, you start doing the math and you, if you ask 10 guys in prison, all of them say, \"I didn't cooperate. I didn't cooperate. I didn't cooperate.\" Like, okay, well you ask\n100, \"I didn't cooperate.\" Like, nobody's gonna say, \"I cooperated.\" - Does that break your heart a little bit that people back stab\neach other like this? - It does, it does. But you know, but I have such a low opinion of people, you know what I'm saying? Like, I don't expect it. It's not that I don't like people, it's that I just don't\nexpect anything of them. You know, I don't expect\nyou to look out for me. You know, there was a time when I did, I thought, I look out for you,\nyou should look out for me. But I just don't expect that anymore. - See, but I think humanity flourishes because there is a lot of people\nout there that do the thing that is difficult to do\nin terms of integrity. - That may be, but these\naren't people with integrity. These are criminals. If these were decent human beings, and all of them will tell\nyou, \"Well, why'd you do that? \"Oh, you know, I was a drug\naddict or I needed the money.\" Well, if you were, if you\nwere a decent human being, you would have gotten off the drugs. You would've gone and gotten three jobs. You can work 80 hours\na week, I've done it. You can work 84, 85, 80, you\ncan work 90 hours a week. You can do that. \"Oh,\nI did it for my kids.\" No, you're lazy. You could have worked\nthree jobs for your kids. Instead you decided to\nsell methamphetamine. \"Well, I was addicted.\" You\ncould've gotten off meth. It wasn't important. It\nwas the easy way out. You're not someone with integrity. So for you to sit there and say, \"Hey, I'm gonna act like a\nscumbag, but now I got caught or you got caught, and I\ndon't want you to tell on me.\" Well, you're a guy that robs banks. You stick guns in people's faces. You kidnap people, you torture\npeople, you sell drugs. You're not, you're not\na moral, ethical person. But you want, you want\neverybody else to hold up to some ethical code while\nyou're robbing grandma. That's not right. Like,\nyou know, so, you know, I get the whole Omerta code, you know, and there was a mo there was\na time when I was, you know, delusional enough to believe that. But you know, after you're going through it, no. And after going through\nit multiple times, no. - I have to really think about that. And I deeply appreciate\nyour honesty on this. - Because it's, I think, I mean, there's all kinds of\ncriminals in this world, and they all have all kinds of stories. And your story is one of, I don't know if it came from\ndesperation versus a love of this kind of game, right? Like, it wasn't part of it. And attraction to the\ncreative aspect of this, of breaking the rules\nwhen nobody else can, and you figure out a way to do it. - I think initially it was, I needed the money. Like that's the first thing, you know? You say, \"Oh, okay, well I\nneed,\" and if you ask most guys, \"Oh, well man, I needed the money.\" You needed the money. But, and then I definitely\nneeded the money. But then you get $50,000 in your bank and then you get 100, and then it's 200, and then it's half a million\nand then it's a million. And what the hell are you\nstill committing fraud for? You've got half a million or\na million dollars in the bank or worth of real estate, or you've, you're making five, $10,000 a month just in rental income. Why are you still committing fraud? So it turn, I think it\nmorphs into the creativity in part for me. And two, it was a chance\nfor me to prove to everybody how smart I was, you know? I mean, it was done outta\ndesperation initially, and then it just turned into\npure narcissistic arrogance. Look at me, look at how I can do things that nobody else can do. Look how smart I am. I just walked into Bank\nof America, handed them seven documents that were all fraudulent and they cut me a check for $250,000. Like, wow, I'm amazing.\nYou know? And guess what? They're never gonna get their check. And they won't know even\nknow where to start to try and find the person because\nthey're looking for a phantom. So, you know, and you\nfeel great. I felt great. I used to, I felt like James Bond. I felt like 007. It was amazing. And, you know, and it did, it feeded my need to feel important. You know, even if it was, it was even if that was a lie, 'cause all that success was just a lie. - Well, no, you were good at it. - I was good at it, but it was, it's not- - It was illegal.\n- It's not like I'm Elon Musk, you know what I'm saying? Like, there's, it's not like\nI'm an exceptional human. I'm an exceptional human\nbeing at a horrific thing at committing fraud. - Well, the question is, how\nmany people are getting hurt? Because-\n- Initially the thing is, initially nobody got hurt. That's the thing. Nobody ever lost any money directly. Like I didn't go and say, give me $50,000 and I\nran off with your money. Like I wasn't doing that and\nthat was a great justification. But at some point, and we\nwe'll get into that, you know, I take off on the run\nand people do lose money. I didn't take that money directly and for some reason in my, you know, sick mind or whatever the case may be, that seems like a distinction\nto me that makes me feel okay, is that I never said, \"Give\nme 300, give me $10,000.\" And I ran off with it. But I put people in a position\nwhere I damaged the credit or damaged the title to their house. And they had to go get a\nlawyer to fix that, you know? And so that they had to\ngo pay a lawyer $10,000. So I absolutely caused that\nperson that I stood, to me to, you're a victim and I owe you that money. And it was a shitty thing to do because even at the time I was like, \"Oh, they'll make a couple\nphone calls, it'll be fine.\" It wasn't fine. And if I had really put\nany thought into it all, I would've known it's gonna\nreally affect these people. And those people had done nothing wrong with the exception of trusting me. They rented me their house, or they owner financed their house. They made the mistake of bumping into me and now they owe 10,000, $20,000. You know? And I'm sure a a ton of anguish. - So what happened when you\nwere caught that first time? - So I was caught. I got\nthree years probation. You know, I took the probation. - What does that involve?\n- Initially it was, it was such a slap on the wrist. - Were you allowed to still practice being the-\n- No, well, okay, so I wasn't, I had to, I couldn't own the\nmortgage company anymore. That was a good question,\n'cause like I, you would think, you know, wouldn't it be great\nif I could keep on going? But what they said was, you know, \"You have to forfeit your brokers license and your brokerage business license.\" And what I did was, I transferred my brokerage\nbusiness license to a guy that essentially bought my business. They allowed me to work as a consultant in the mortgage industry. You know, 'cause they\nwent, you know, they go, my lawyer goes to the judge and\nsays, \"What else can he do?\" So, and so I have a friend, his name's Dave Walker, he was a CPA. He came in and he bought my business and he paid me like $9,000 a month. And that covered my bills. My wife and I got divorced. So she's my ex-wife. And, I don't know what to do, right? Like, I don't, I could, you know, and I always say, you know,\nI could have like, you know, you look back and it's like, I could have claimed bankruptcy. I could have moved into my\nparents' spare room, you know, something like that. But, you know, 'cause I had, I lost everything in my divorce. I had huge child support\npayment, you know, not that that has anything\nto do, like with my ex-wife. Like, I absolutely signed up for that. Like, I wanted to pay that. But it was a chunk of change, you know. So we're talking about a\ncouple thousand dollars a month for, you know, for child support. She got all of the apartments that we had. We had about a million, million and a half dollars\nworth of apartments, which isn't a lot now,\nbut that's probably five or $6 million now. So she got all the apartments,\nso she got everything. So now I'm sitting here like I got, I can't be a mortgage\nbroker, I can get my $9,000, but I have to help this\nguy run this company, train people, do that sort of thing. So what I decided to do was, I was gonna start flipping houses. - Legitimately or no? - Well, initially I thought about doing it legitimately, right? But at the same time, I\nwas also in the middle of figuring out how to make\nthese synthetic identities. So I'm making the payments\nevery month, remember? Two months in, three months?\nNo, no credit scores. No credit scores. No credit scores. And I'm also saying, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna start buying houses,\nrenovate them, sell them. So the truth is, we actually renovated probably one house completely. I remember it was on 26th Street. We renovated the house completely. - On the outside in and the inside? - Yeah, outside, inside.\nIt's done. It's good. - [Lex] Okay, great. - Me and this guy actually, Dave Walker, the guy that bought my business. So we renovate it and it just\nso happens at the same time, I go to pull the credit one day and wow. 700 plus credit scores. And I went, \"We don't have\nto sell this thing at all.\" Like we just, we can just, I can sell it and put it in this guy's name\nand let him refinance it. And so that's what we did. We ended up, I ended up selling it to this synthetic identity. - Do you remember the first\nsynthetic identity? The name? - The first one was a Joel Cologne. - Yeah.\n- And then I started getting creative because the ones after that, I started naming well, so\nI had like Joel Cologne and an Allen Duncan. But then I, do you remember\nthe movie, \"Reservoir Dogs?\" - [Lex] Hmm-mm. - So I started naming the characters after guys in the \"Reservoir Dogs.\" So I had a James Red, you know,\nI had like a Michael White, a Lee Black, I had a William Blue, David Silver, Brandon Green. So then I start developing these guys. Now I thought, oh, forget\nthose normal things. I'm going with these with\nthe \"Reservoir Dogs.\" And I thought I was so cute too. - You think in retrospect\nthat was a mistake? - It was so stupid. That was just, it's just,\nthere's so many things, so many mistakes I made. I mean, within the fraud,\nthere are mistakes I made. But, you know, other than just\nthe overall committing fraud. But it was just like, I\nthought it was so cute. And then, you know, you\nget in front of the judge and the judge is hearing\nabout the \"Reservoir Dogs,\" and Mr. Green and Mr. Black,\nMr. White, Mr. This, Mr. That. And he's looking at me\njust like, \"You jackass.\" Like, and you know, what am I saying? I'm like, \"Yeah, I thought that was cute,\" you know, but nothing's cute. So, you know, plus I'm making fake banks. - What's the purpose of the fake banks? - Well, sometimes you have\nto have your down payment in the bank, right? So you have to, they\nwant three months worth of bank statements to see that, hey, he's got his $50,000 in the bank. And then the more, the\nmore properties you buy, they start to want to see\nwhat's called reserves. They wanna make sure that you can pay all your mortgage payments. If this guy loses his job, can this guy maintain all\nthese mortgage payments for the next six months? And see they do that and\nthey think you're gonna go, you know, \"Oh no, he can't do it.\" They go, \"Well then we won't lend it.\" Well, when they do that to\nme, I go, \"Of course I do. Of course he's got it. Let me send you over the bank statements. Oh, you want to call the bank? Call them.\" - [Lex] So there's a phone\nnumber, there's a website. - Yes, you can call. We'll get on there. I'll do the whole, (Matt imitates typing) you know, and \"Hold on, okay, what's the name again? Do you have the account number? (Matt imitates typing) Hold on.\" You wait a little bit.\nYou know, you come out. \"Oh, okay, I got it here. I can't tell you the\nexact amount right now, but what was his balance last month?\" And you, you tell. \"Oh, yep. That that's it.\nExactly. Okay. Thank you.\" Click. - Would you do different voices\nor would you be the same? - No, I've done different voices or I'd just have somebody else do it. You know, Gretchen would've done it. Or one of the brokers,\nSusan would've done it. One of the brokers that worked\nfor me, or you know, Kelly or Johnny Moon, or, I\nmean, I have so many guys and you know, they just get\non the phone and they do it, 'cause they're all doing something fraud and we're all working together. So, hey, I need you to call this guy. I need to call this guy and verify this and say, \"Oh, I'm at the bank. Okay, I'm at the bank. Okay, cool.\" And they call back. And- - Does this feel like an organized system or was it more improv, just like dealing with the different situations? - The government would\ndefinitely say it was organized. I always say it was, you\nknow, you're a bunch of, it's just a bunch of guys,\nyou know, to, you know, it's, you're joking around with everybody and you're helping each other\nand it's not like everybody's, you know, kicking up to Tommy. - Yeah.\n- You know, so. - So, and then all these new puzzles come up and you figure out ways to sell these puzzles.\n- Right. You go in and you say,\n\"Hey, I've got this loan. I need to get this loan\nif this guy's trying to buy this house and I need a loan that looks like this, where can we go? And by the way, they cannot, they cannot order a copy\nof his tax returns.\" So you don't want to have to\nsign what's called a 4506. So they're like, \"Oh, okay, listen, so and so's got a program that,\" da-da-da, you know, and you go back and forth, \"But you have to have\nthis much in reserves. But you got the bank, right?\" \"Yeah, yeah, I got the\nbank, I could do that.\" You know, so you go in and you throw it out\nthere to five or six guys and you're gonna come up with an answer. - So you're on probation\nhere just to self-reflect, did you start doing\nthis while on probation because of the money or\nbecause it gave you meaning? - God, I, you know, I mean\npart, a big part of that. The reason is, I did not want to move back in with my parents and I didn't want my father\nto see me struggling. And I didn't want him to, it was my success. He had no idea. My success had been the\nfirst time he'd ever really been proud of me. Does that make sense?\n- Financial success? - Yes.\n- At which point, when was the first time\nyou told him you did something and he was like, you\ncould sense him being proud? - Oh, when I became a mortgage broker, when I became a mortgage broker and I went to work for the company and we're talking about within a week, I got a client, three days later, I got a client, a week later, got a client, two days\nlater, got a client. Like, I closed four loans my first month. And my dad was like, well, \"How much money are you gonna make?\" \"And I'm like, oh, I'm\ncharging this much, this, I got a point on the back. I got this, I got boom. I'm thinking I'm gonna\nwalk home after taxes like 10, 11,000.\" \"Jesus, God almighty,\" you\nknow, \"Are you serious?\" \"Well, we'll see, don't\nstart counting your chickens before the, you know,\" and then, you know, two\nwhatever, three weeks later, four weeks later, you\nknow, boom, I got a check. It's like $9,000 or something. Or, and then, you know,\nthe next month it's 12 and the next month it's 16. And you know, then they make me a manager. And you know, it just,\n- He didn't know any, if it was illegitimate.\n- No, he thinks, he thinks, \"My son, he's brilliant,\" you know, \"He's great, he's wonderful.\" I had, you know, was\ncertainly not proud of me prior to that. But, you know, my dad was athletic. He was extremely bright. I mean brilliant. And I was a kid who had to\nbe put into special schools who barely graduated high school, who ended up going to college and getting a degree in fine arts because I was never gonna be able to get a degree in business. It wasn't gonna happen. So when I graduated college, I remember with the degree\nin fine arts, he said, \"The best, you'll, the best\nthing you could do with that is, maybe you could draw\ncaricatures at Disney World.\" You know what I'm saying? Which wasn't a compliment,\nbut it wasn't like, \"Hey, you could draw.\" So yeah, he, you know,\nand then I turned around and I tried to go to work\nfor State Farm Insurance, which is who he worked for. He worked for them for\nlike 40 something years. And I failed the aptitude test. So then I went and worked\nfor another insurance company and I was an insurance adjuster, but I couldn't keep up with the workload. And then I ended up working construction. I'm still barely paying\nmy bills, you know, and that's basically where\nmy dad felt like that's, you know, he was polite to me. You know, we was, we\nwere, you know, cordial. But yeah, I wasn't, I think he felt he\ndeserved a better kid, so. - Well when you, when you\nstarted doing mortgages, that's when he was like-\n- Of course he was like- - Oh, this kid's got something. - I'm driving, I'm driving a new, I got, I just pulled in a new car and I got a, I just bought\na house that was, you know, four or five blocks away from his house, from where I grew up, from where he lives, you know,\nlived at that time, you know, six blocks away from\nwhere my sister's married to her lawyer husband,\nlike I'm doing pretty good. And then within three\nmonths we bought, you know, my new wife, we buy a, a quadplex and then we're buying a\ntriplex and another quadplex and a 10 unit and then a duplex, and another duplex and a quadplex. And it's like, what the hell's going on? This guy is blowing up. He's going on vacation\nhere and vacation here. And you know, so he, you know, and so when the FBI comes\nin and they indict me, and I take the three years\nprobation, like, I mean probably the worst thing\nin the world, you know, other than going to prison\nwould've been just having to just sell everything and\ngo move in and start over and sell used cars. Not that there's anything\nwrong with selling used cars, but I just felt like, you know, I just didn't want to\ndisappoint him any more than I already had. So I thought, I'm gonna flip houses and then I'll start maybe\na development company. So I'll buy some vacant\nlots and all this and that. The problem is these houses,\nI'm buying for 50,000. If I fix them up and sell\nthem, maybe I make 20, 25,000. And then you gotta find\na qualified borrower. It's very hard to find\na qualified borrower that wants to live in Ybor City. Back then, it's, I still think it's rough, but those same houses are\ngoing for three and 400,000. So, you know, I'm buying houses,"

      "text": "I gotta get qualified borrowers,\nI do all the renovations. It's a nightmare, you know? And if I, you know, looking\nback, it's like, okay, well then you gotta bite the bullet. It's just what you have to\ndo. I didn't want to do that. I didn't want to do it\nwhether it was laziness or I don't know, you know, I\njust thought I'm good at this. I'm gonna run, I'm just\ngonna start running a scam. I'm gonna figure out how\nto drive the prices up, buy the houses for 50,\nrecord them at 200,000, and then have these\nsynthetic identities buy all the properties, refinance\nthem, pull out the cash, make six months worth of payments, let them all go into foreclosure. And that really, really\nstarted working well. Very well. I had one time where I had a guy, it was James Red, the synthetic\nidentity was James Red. And he had bought two or three houses and there was somebody at\nthe office who was friends of somebody who knew the title company where we were closing the loans. And he called her, her name was Mary, and said, \"Mary, this guy James Red, like Cox is doing something shady. James Red doesn't even exist.\" She goes and looks at the\nfile, her last couple files, and she realizes, of course, obviously like this guy never showed up. She remembers Cox picked up the files, like, and he's saying he doesn't exist. So she freaks out. She\ncalls the mortgage broker. Mortgage broker calls me,\nmortgage broker calls me up and says, \"Listen, Mary said\nshe's not closing the next loan unless James Red shows up.\" And I went, \"Wow, that's a tough one.\" And she's like, \"Okay,\nso what do you wanna do? Do you wanna go to another title company?\" Like, we're supposed to\nclose in like three days, two, three days. And I said, well, I mean, he's\ngonna have to show up then. I said, I'm gonna, I'll figure it out. Like, gimme a couple days, gimme, lemme figure this out. And she's like, \"Okay, well, I don't know how that's gonna happen. He doesn't exist.\" Keep in mind at this\npoint, I don't need IDs. I don't need a real ID. I mean, I can, I figured out how to kind of make a real ID, right? Like I could make one,\nI could take sandpaper and sand off the\ninformation on a regular ID and then I would print\nthe corrected information in reverse on a piece of transparency and I would glue it over there and you could still see\nthe holograms and stuff. It actually worked pretty good. I don't, a cop's not gonna,\nit's not gonna pass muster with a cop, but somebody at\nthe bank, like I was able to go in and I would open\na bank account with it. Well, so, one of the things I had done when I was closing these loans was, I would go online and I would pick, you have to pick a photo\nof somebody, right? To put on the driver's license, right? So I'm not making a fake\nID for all these guys 'cause I don't need a fake\nID for all these guys. Not with my picture on it. But I need a fake, I need a copy of an ID, but I need a picture. Where do I get the picture? So I go to Hillsborough\nCounty's arrest website and I would find people that\nI knew that had been arrested. And so I found a guy named Eric Tomargo who had been arrested. He had like, I don't\nknow what it was, the DUI or domestic violence,\nI forget what it was, but there was a picture of him. So I print out the picture,\nI cut it up, I paste it onto a driver's license\nand I make a copy of it, you know, for James Red. That's what I'd been\ngiving the title people, when I would close, I'd\nsign all the documents and I'd leave them that copy so that it looked like\nthey made a copy of it. And then they would\nnotarize all the documents even though they'd never seen this person. They have a copy of his driver's license. Everything's signed. Cox\nsaid he signed it, it's good, notarized, here's your check. So what I do is I think, let me see if I can get Eric to do this. He's been to, I knew he'd\nbeen to prison before, so I call up Eric and I remember\none of my buddies, like, \"He's never gonna do this.\" And I was like, \"I think\nhe will. I think he will.\" So, and that's how, and that's really that kind of like, \"You\nthink, what do you think?\" \"No, let me try, lemme call him.\" \"I don't know, bro.\" Like, that's the kind of\nconversations you're having. Like, but really looking back, I'm still curious.\n- I would love to hear the opener few sentences\nthat you have with him. - I got, I can tell you\nexactly what I said, 'cause it's burned in my mind. He comes in, so what Eric\nwas doing at that time, he was actually working for us. He worked for somebody else,\nbut periodically we would, you know, we'd buy a house\nand we'd call him up. We'd say, \"Hey, can\nyou, you and your boss, can you guys come over and\ntrim the trees of this house? Trim all the trees, take all the crap in the yard, clean it up.\" They go, \"Yeah, sure, no problem.\" 'Cause that's what he did, worked for like a handyman service. So they would come and they'd clean it up and they'd do that. So I say, \"Can you come over?\"\nAnd he goes like, \"Yeah.\" So he comes to the office,\nwhatever, a few hours later and he comes in the conference room. I said, \"Hey Eric, what's going on?\" And he says, \"Hey, you\nknow, how's it going?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" I said, \"Listen,\" I said, \"I'm gonna tell you something. I need a favor.\" He's like, \"Okay, cool.\" He's like, \"What is it?\" I said, \"You know all these houses we've been having you go and clean up?\" He's like, \"Yeah, we had that. You had, you painted that\none house, you did this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know.\" \"Right, so here's what we've been doing. I've been buying these houses for $50,000, recording them for 200, and then I have these\nfake people buy them.\" And I explain, I just lay it out for him. And he's like, \"Wow, that's,\" he's like, \"That's, fuck it bro,\nthat's ingenious, man. That's some, that's\nsmart. Like, wow, woo.\" And you know, I was like, \"Okay,\" I said, \"Yeah,\nI know, that's great. So here's the thing.\" I said, \"The title company\nwho's been closing some of these loans and we have\na closing in a couple days, she wants this guy, James Red, to show up and I need someone to\nshow up as James Red.\" And he goes, \"Wow.\" He goes, \"Who are you\ngonna get to do that?\" And I was just thinking, I was just like, you're not understanding,\nI'm not confiding in you, 'cause I need a friend, you know? So, and I looked at him, I said, \"Well, I was thinking you might do it.\" He was like, \"Whew,\" he\nsays, \"That's a big favor.\" I said, \"It is a big favor.\" \"I could be in a lot of trouble.\" And I said, \"I know.\" And he goes, \"Well, whoa, wait a minute.\" He goes, \"I can't go.\" He said, \"You have to give\nthese people a driver's license. You said the driver's licenses, you were using mugshots. You said she's closed a couple of these. She already, she's seen\nthis guy's picture.\" And I go, \"She has seen this picture.\" I said, \"The thing is for\nJames Red, I pulled the mugshot offline of you when you were\narrested a couple years ago.\" And he jumps up and he\ngoes, \"You motherfucker!\" And I go, \"Whoa, whoa,\nwhoa,\" I said, \"Eric,\" I said, \"Wait a minute.\" I said, \"Hold on, hold on.\" I said, \"Listen,\" I said, \"I\nonly did that because I knew if it came down to this moment, you were the only person that I knew that could pull this off, that'd have the balls\nto walk in and do it.\" And he sat there and he went, \"Yeah, you're right, you're right.\" And I mean, well, I\ncouldn't believe he fell. Listen, this guy would\nbeat the brakes off me. He was, he's like 510, 511. He's boxed. He's a big guy.\n- Yeah. - So, you know, it's like I've weathered\nthat part of the storm. And he sat there and he\ngoes, \"Right, right.\" And he goes, \"Well I'm\nnot doing it for free, I'm not doing it for nothing.\" I said, \"No, bro, of course not.\" I mean, you know, what he's like, \"You're making a lot of money.\" I said, \"Well, keep in mind\na lot of that money goes back in the property, it's not\nlike we're walking away with, you know,\" I think I\nsaid like tens of thousands, we're really walking away\nwith hundreds of thousands. \"It's not like we're walking\naway with a bunch of money or, you know, it's, you\nknow, we gotta put it, we gotta buy more properties,\nwe gotta keep it going. We gotta make the payments.\" \"Oh, I know, but still, I\ncould get in a lot of trouble.\" I said, \"I understand, bro.\" I go, \"Well, what do you want?\" And I remember thinking\nif he asked for more than like 10 or 15,000, like\nI'll just, I'll do it myself. We'll just change title\ncompanies and we'll go and I'll do it myself. And he sat there and he went, \"I want $500.\" And I went, \"$500?\" Listen,\nI almost started laughing. I mean, I was like, I put my hand over my, I was like, \"$500?\"\n- Yeah. - It's gonna take you 30 minutes. And he's like, \"I don't care, bro. I could get in a lot of trouble.\" I was like, \"Oh, well yeah,\nI'm not paying you now. You gotta sign first.\" And he's like, \"Oh, you\nknow, I'll sign, I'll sign. I know you're good for\nit, I know you're good.\" Bro, he did it for 500 bucks, I made a fake ID for him. He goes in to the place,\nhe signs \"James Red.\" Comes out. What was even, you know\nwhat was funny about that? Was when we walked into the title company, we're sitting in the lobby and Mary comes walking\nout, she looks at me and she goes, \"Mr. Cox, I\ndon't know why you're here.\" She goes, \"I told Kelly,\"\nthat was the broker. She goes, \"I told the broker\nthat I'm not closing the loan unless James Red shows up,\"\nand Eric stands up on cue, and he goes, \"I'm James Red.\" And she was like, and she\ngoes, \"Hold on a second.\" She runs in the back, comes\nback with a file, opens it up, looks at the picture, and\nshe's like, \"Oh, I'm so sorry. Give me five minutes.\nI've got the file, I.\" Prints up the docs, he goes\nin, signs and when we're there, she's passing out the checks. 5,000 here, 25,000 here, 35,000 here, 7,000 here, 6,000 here. So he sees all these checks and I'm like, \"Oh, I got that, I and the construction company. No, no, no, I have that. I'll take care of that.\nI'll take care of that. So I get all the checks and I leave. We go sit in my Audi and he sits down and he is like, \"Bro,\nit's a lot of money.\" \"A lot of that money goes back\ninto the properties, Eric.\" And he is like, \"Ah, still bro.\" And I said, and I counted out 500 bucks. But listen, a week later\nwe had another closing. So he comes in, I said, \"Hey bro,\" he said, \"Hey, what's going on?\" And I said, \"I need you to\ndo the James red thing.\" He goes, \"Yeah, I've\nbeen thinking about that. I did that way too cheap.\" I said, \"I get it man,\nwell how much do you want? What do you want?\" And I'm thinking, if\nit's more than 10 or 15, I'll do it myself. And he sits there and he\ngoes, \"I want $1,000.\" I go \"$1,000?\" Like, oh, like, oh my God. So I gave him $1,000 and he did another one. And, but by that point it was like five or six, we'd done five\nor six with that guy. And after five or six plus the\ncredit cards, plus, you know, all the other things, like their credit scores start dropping. And you know, if it was 700,\nnow it's down to like 600 and at 600 you couldn't really borrow enough to make it worth it. It's like, and I have other\npeople in the wings waiting. So, you know, we would just, I'd go out and I'd run up the credit cards and pull as much money, pull\nall the money outta the banks and close the accounts\nand then stop paying. - And you said a lot of people knew. - Yeah.\n- So he was one of the people and then-\n- He was one of the people. - Why do you think nobody said anything? - I, well, I mean, I think\neverybody was making money. The appraiser at that\ntime, I had an appraiser. Eventually I order the appraisal software and I just start doing\nthe appraisals myself. Like, why give this guy 500 bucks? So.\n- So you were doing the appraisal yourself, - Bro, I'm doing it.\n- How's that possible? How's that? Is there a check against the, is there- - There is. It's just funny, nobody\never questions that. You actually have to have a license to get the appraisal software. So I get an appraiser's\nthat we're working with, I get her license and I create an email address as her. - Ah, so it was a synthetic appraiser. - Right, it was a real person. But I end up ordering the\nappraisal software by emailing, it was called Alamo,\nAlamo Appraisal Software. So I end up emailing them as her and they go, \"Well, we can't give you, we can't sell you the software unless we, we need a\ncopy of your license.\" Boom, here's your license. So I send her the, I send them the license and then we pay for it with a credit card. You know, you could go\nget like a green dot card, you go put 500 bucks on it or 1,000. The software was like\n1500 bucks or something. So you pick them like back then, you know, it was a long time ago. So 1500 bucks, they mail it to us and now I've got the software. So now I can, you know, I\ncan do the appraisals myself. - What stops you from appraising it not for 200,000, but even more? - There's no comparable sales. So no matter what you sent to the bank, they're gonna look at it. Like they're gonna have a, their in-house appraiser is\ngoing to do a desktop review. He's gonna go online, he is gonna check to make sure all the appraise,\nall of the comparable sales are sold for what you said they sold for, are the same square footage, were built, what the pictures look like,\nwhere, how far they are, he's gonna double check everything, but you know, he's some\nguy who's on salary and he does, you know, whatever, 40 or 50 of these a day or something. It doesn't take him long.\nAnd so it's cheaper that way where we pay for the appraiser,\nappraisals, the whole thing. - Got it. So everybody's getting paid. - Right. And so at this\npoint, I'm doing that, right? You know, and I'm getting\ncaught periodically. - Can you give an example? What\ndo you mean getting caught? - I'm living in Tampa Heights, which is right next to\nYbor City in Tampa, right? So this is all, these are\nall like little suburbs of Tampa and they're all built\nback in the 1920s, right. 1890s, 1910, 1920. So I've bought this eight unit building. I renovated it into a triplex. I mean, I'm driving an\nAudi, I'm dating a woman that I should not have been dating. Like, I mean, I don't know\nwhat she was thinking. So I'm, you know, you're\ngoing on vacations, like everything, life's good. So, but every once in a\nwhile, you know, like where, you know where things\nhappen, you get a phone call, \"Hey, this is what just happened.\" And one time I got a phone\ncall from same broker, Kelly. Kelly called me up and said,\n\"Listen, we got a problem.\" This was, I wanna say this was Allen Duncan. This was one of the first\nones that I had done, right? But we used him, but, and so he, so she calls me up and says, \"Listen, Allen Duncan never made his\nfirst mortgage payment.\" And I had a friend of mine, or one of my co-defendants when we closed on that loan, we both got checks for\nwhatever, 40 or 50 grand. Keep in mind, we're also buying, some of this money's going\ninto a business account. We're buying property, we're buying, so it's not like I'm pocketing\nhundreds of thousands of dollars, or even, you know, even 20 or $30,000 on every closing. I'm more like, I'm getting 25, 10, 20, and this guy's getting 10\nand this guy's getting 15, and then we're taking 60 and we're putting it into\nthe business account. We're buying a bunch of vacant lots, or we're building some new houses. So we're trying to kind of take all this and turn it into a development company, but we still have to pay our bills. So, you know, my buddy's\ngotta go to, he's gotta go to Amsterdam at least\nfor two weeks, you know. - Right.\n- He's from Belgium. That's you, apparently you have to do that at least once a year. So so when I gave him\nhis check, the check, I said, \"Look, you're gonna make the pay, here's the like 20 grand or 15 grand, but you gotta make the\npayments on this thing for the next six months.\" He goes, \"No problem.\" I said, \"Okay.\" So she calls me up a\nmonth and a half later and says, \"Hey, Allen Duncan did not, did not make his first payment.\" And I went, \"Oh my God.\" And he was actually renting the apartment downstairs from me. So I run downstairs and I open the door and I go, \"Bro,\" I'm like, \"Did\nyou make Duncan's payment?\" And he turns around and\nhe is like, \"Is it due?\" And I was like, \"Oh my God.\" So I run back, you know,\nI grabbed the phone. I'm like, \"He didn't make\nit. He didn't make it.\" She's like, \"Okay, well\nhere's what's happening. The account executive is\ncalling. They've got the file.\" And it was called, it was South Star Bank. \"South Star Bank has it. They reviewed it. They've already been ordering documents. they're saying that this\nguy, there's a problem. They are, it's it's falling apart. Like the whole thing's falling. They know something's wrong.\" - But they don't know exactly what, it's just something suspicious or what? - That she didn't tell\nme that on the phone. - Okay.\n- Like she's saying there's something wrong,\nthey're freaking out. - Yeah.\n- Because the account executive didn't really know. She just got a phone call saying, \"Hey, have you ever met this broker?\" Did she meet the guy? Who\nis the guy, he hasn't paid. \"We're calling the cell.\nNobody's answering.\" And really most of this\nwas my buddy Rudy's fault. He's just not doing any of this stuff, any of the things he's\nsupposed to be doing. So we go to the office and I call South Star\nBank, I get the secretary and I said, \"Look, I need to talk to\" whatever the guy, the big guy was. It was one of them was like the president and one was like the somebody else. Anyway, vice president. So I said, \"I need to talk to\nso-and-so the vice president.\" And she says, \"I'm sorry,\nhe's in a business meeting.\" I said, well, \"Listen, tell\nhim this is Allen Duncan, like you need to go tell him it's, Allen Duncan's on the phone right now. I assure you he wants to talk to me.\" And she's like, \"All right, hold on.\" And I mean, like 20\nseconds later, you know, speakerphone, \"Hey, Mr.\nDuncan, this is so and so, and you know, I'm here with our lawyer and the president of the\nbank and our head of fraud. We were just discussing you.\" And I was like, okay, I\nunderstand that you guys are, I haven't made my first payment.\" I said, \"It actually\ncame back in the mail. I had the wrong address.\nThat was completely my fault. And I apologize.\" I said, \"But I can get you\na cashier's check today. I will overnight it. No problem.\nHope that's gonna be okay.\" I said, they said, \"Way,\nwe're way past that, way past that.\" I said, \"Okay, well\nwhat's, what's the issue?\" And they were like, \"I\nmean, look, to be honest, I don't think I'm talking to Allen Duncan. I don't think there is an Allen Duncan.\" He's like, \"I mean, your Social Security number\nwas issued a couple years ago. We called the bank and this was, we had gone with like South\nor SunTrust Bank, right? So it was a real bank, so\nit wasn't our normal bank. And they called, they don't, they don't have any record of you.\" And I was like, \"Well,\nI've never been happy with South Star Bank there if, you know, it sounds like a banking error.\" And they're, and they're like, \"Yeah, I don't think, this isn't cute.\" - He says, \"I don't think I'm talking to Allen Duncan right now.\" - Right.\n- And you were- - Terrified.\n- You're just. - Terrified, I'm not.\n- But you have to be playing it cool I guess. - I mean, I know, what am I gonna say? No, you're talking to Matt\nCox. Like, I can't say that. Like, I'm just gotta keep running with it. Just like, okay, well look, you know, and he's like, you know, \"We\ncalled the DMV, this, you know, they don't have a list\nof you in the, you know, in their website. We think that the, you know,\nwe don't think you exist. You know, we're still\nwaiting for a phone call back from who, so and so and so and so and so,\" and I'm just like, \"Oh my God.\" And I said, \"Have you called, have you called the authorities yet?\" And they were like, \"No, we haven't. But once we put our\nfile together, we will.\" And then the head of the\nfraud department, they said, \"Oh, by the way, Mr.\" I forget his name, \"But the head of the fraud department, the head worked for the\nFBI for like 10 years or something, or 12 years.\" And so I mean, I'm just like, and by the way, the broker is there, and my buddy Rudy is there. And I mean, there, he's pacing the room. She's in tears crying. Like they're, and I'm\nlike, \"Okay, well fellas,\" I say, \"Where's this headed? Where's this going? What are we doing?\" And so they're kind of\nchuckling and joking about it. And I remember being like,\nthinking, what's the deal? Like, it's weird. And I said, \"Look, well, why don't I just, lemme just pay you back.\" They said, \"Ah, we'll get the money. We're not worried about it,\" I\nsaid, \"You don't seem worried about the money, about\ngetting any of the money back. Like, don't, why don't you just let me, I'll cut you a check. I can get you the money back. Like what do I,\" I owed\nhim like 150 or something. I forget exactly. It was nothing. I'm like, \"I owe you 150,000, lemme cut your check for 150,000.\" And they were like, \"No,\nno, you know, that's, we'll get the money back when\nwe foreclose on the property.\" And that's when I was like, \"Oh, they think the property's worth\nlike $195,000 or something.\" And I went, \"Oh, I said, I understand. Okay, so do you have the\nappraisal in front of you?\" And they were like, \"Yeah.\" And I said, \"Open it up.\" I said, 'Take a look at comp number one. That's owned by a guy\nnamed, you know, Lee Black. Comp number two, you know, is\nowned by, you know, whatever, David Silver, whatever the names were.\" And I'm like, \"You know,\nlike Black, Silver, Red. I said, I am all those people.\" And I said, \"Lemme tell\nyou what I've done.\" And I tell them, just lay it out. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I said, \"So you can call the FBI, but you're not gonna\nget all your money back. Or you could let me\ngive you your money back and we can let this, we\ncan let sleeping dogs lie. The whole thing goes away, I apologize. You know, I had every intention\nof making all the payments. It's a glitch. You caught me. No, my bad.\" And so these guys are\njust like, \"Oh my God.\" Like now they're, they put me on hold, they're looking through the file. They come back and I remember\nat some point we go back, forth, back and forth and\nfinally they come back and they said, \"Listen,\nyou still have the money?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" Well first they come\nback, they threaten me. \"Oh well when we give this to the FBI, you're,\" and I said, \"That's not true.\" I said, 'The money was\ndeposited into a bank account. It has since been moved. The bank account has been closed,\nit's been removed in cash. That money is gone. You\nwill never see that money. I will be cutting you if\nI pay you back at all, it'll be from another account.\" And so the FBI agent ends\nup saying, \"He's right. Even if we caught him red\nhanded, the likelihood that any of these funds will be\never be recouped is zero. Like, there's almost no\nmoney's ever recouped.\" And so we end up, they\nput me on hold again. They come back and they go, \"How quickly can you get\nus a cashier's check?\" And I go, and like, that day I go get them a cashier's check overnight, the cashier's check. They never called the FBI,\nthey never did anything. Now, at that point, we\nactually ditched that whole, that James or Allen Duncan. I remember at that point\nwe went to the mall, ran up all the credit cards\nand just threw everything away and walked away because it was shot. You know, that whole, that guy was shot. I think we borrowed whatever, $800,000 or 900,000 in his name. - So with the banks, it's really, really all about the money. - That, listen, when I go on the run, I got one where I was caught\nso red-handed, it's insane how bad it was. And listen, that's nothing. I got caught by Washington\nMutual one time. I was caught by Washington\nMutual, where we had done six owner occupied duplexes. So if you say you're\ngonna live in a house, you can get about 95% financing. But if it's an investment\nproperty, you gotta put down 20%. You get about 80% financing. So a buddy of mine who\nwas a sheriff's deputy, we had his wife buy, I'm gonna say six owner occupied duplexes, saying she lived in\nevery single one of them. Well, you can't own or\noccupy six dwellings. Like, that's fraud. Now granted, her W-2s and\npay stubs were correct, but she didn't put the down payments down. Even the down payments we didn't put down, we actually got cash back. But months later, a lawyer from Washington Mutual ends up calling the mortgage broker and saying that they ended up with two of the owner occupied duplexes because Washington\nMutual had a credit line extended to one of the\nlenders who'd lent the money. So it actually was Washington Mutual. So it was a couple months\nlater when they went to sell it in a, you know, they package\nthem together and sell them. They realized we have the same\ncustomer with two duplexes, side by side, both owner occupied. This is fraud. So she comes in, she tells me, \"Oh my gosh, this lawyer's on the phone. This is what happened.\" I'm like, \"Oh wow, this is horrible.\" I end up getting on the phone with him. We have a huge, we have a conversation. And I'm like, you know, he's like, \"Look, you know, this is a big deal. We could call the FBI.\" I am like, \"Look, who knows\nwho was involved in this. Maybe somebody on your side was involved. Maybe somebody on my side. I don't know what my mortgage broker did. I'll deal with her on my own. Why don't you just let us\nrefinance the properties?\" Not only did we talk him into allowing us to refinance the properties,\nhe gave us a reduced, a reduced balance of what we owed him because we couldn't borrow\nenough to pay him off. So they took like a $20,000 hit just to refinance those properties. Never called the FBI, never did any, we was absolutely fraud. Yeah, I had a broker\none time we got caught with over a million dollars in loans that he had done that were fraudulent. Pinnacle Bancorp, which\nwas out of a Chicago. The owner called me and he was like, \"Look, your\nmortgage broker did this.\" Like, there was a bunch\nof canceled checks. They were fake canceled checks. So they looked like they\nhad run through the bank for somebody's rent, but they hadn't. Does that make sense? - Yeah.\n- Like you pay your rent, they deposit it, it goes to the bank and they've got all the\nnumbers and everything. Well, I had a bunch that were blank that all you had to do was sign, fill out your borrower's information, and then you cut and pasted\nhis name and his address at the upper left hand corner. You make a copy of it, it\nlooks like canceled checks. We had 24 of them. Well, one of my brokers was\nusing them for all of his files. Like even if the person\nreally had a rental history, he didn't wanna order it, he\njust did this, it was easier. - It's faster, yeah.\n- Yeah. Just an idiot. - Wow.\n- So they catch $1 million worth of loans. They call me up and then they\ncaught another $1 million but they had already sold\nthem to Household Bank. So while I'm on the phone with the owner, his name's Gary, and we're talking, he's like, \"Look, this is what we found. This is this, this is what happened.\" And I remember I said, \"Gary, at the end of this conversation, if you think I'm cutting\nyou a check for $1 million, I said, I just don't have it. I don't have it.\" And this was when I owned\nthe mortgage company. And he says, \"No, I, what\nI'm asking you for your word that if any of these come back\non us, they're in Florida, they're in your area,\nyou'll help us get rid of the properties, we'll foreclose. We're gonna have to resell them. I don't wanna be flying down there. Just help us get rid of them.\" I said, \"Absolutely,\nof course, no problem.\" I said, \"What about the,\" I said, \"Well, what are\nyou gonna do with them?\" He goes, \"Well, they're\ngonna be a part of a package, like a $3 million package we're\nselling to Household Bank. The other ones they had\ncaught had already been sold. The ethical thing to do is to contact Household Bank,\nsay, \"We'll buy those back. We are gonna take care of.\" It's not what happened. In fact, Gary flew down\na couple weeks later, took me and several of the\nbrokers, not that broker, but several of the brokers out\nto dinner, had a few drinks and he openly admitted, he's\nlike, \"Look, I don't care if all the loans have fraud in them, as long as they don't come back on me. That's what I'm concerned about.\" 'Cause there's a clawback\nclause for one year. He's like, \"So if they can perform for one year, I don't care.\" That was it. - How many people in the industry do you think are operating like this? And by like this, I mean, in\nthe aforementioned gray area. - I would say there's\nprobably after like the, like after the 2008 financial crisis, I would say it cleaned up considerably. But I would say at this point it's just as bad as it ever was. And keep in mind these, a lot of the loans that caused the problems\nwere like, you know, they called them liar loans or you know, no qualification like,\nno qual loans, right? No income. Well, those loans are, they exist again, like there are subprime companies\nthat are doing that again. They don't, I don't think they\ncall them subprime anymore. They call them, so they\ngot some other name. - Yeah. Rebranded.\n- Yeah, they've rebranded a little bit, but it's\nhappening all over again. - It just seems the whole, the whole real estate\nslash banking system is very prone to this kind of corruption. - I mean, but how can you fix it? Like, a lot of the things, they fixed, a lot of the manipulation they fixed. But if you tighten it too much, then the average person can't get a loan. You know, and the thing is, some of these loans\nsometimes changing a W-2, you know, should that person\nhave gotten into that house? No, he shouldn't have. He didn't qualify. But he makes all of his payments. So it's like, is it a fraudulent loan? Yeah, but it performs. So, you know, I think\nthat, I would say that, I forget what the FBI statistic was. It was like 20% or 30% prior to the two thou prior to the financial crisis,\nit was like 20 or 30% of like bank loans they were saying that contains some kind of fraud, even if it was just a lie. You know, if you want\nto cut 30% out of the, you know that's a ton, that's a ton."

      "text": "- So you're on probation and you're doing these,\nyou're almost getting caught. You are almost getting caught. And you're doing these\nreally large scale scams. How does it get to the point\nwhere you're on the run? - So I'm doing multiple scams, right? So it's not just that I'm doing the scams with the \"Reservoir Dog\" scams, right? I'm not just doing those guys. - Yeah.\n- I'm also creating other identities because\nI've got other people that are involved. They want to do a scam. So this chick I was dating. She wanted to run a scam. So I set up a scam. It's semi complicated,\nbut the bottom line is she ends up stealing a real person. We steal a real person's identity. I have a real person's identity. We get a driver's license in her name, open up some bank\naccounts, go rent a piece of property in her name,\nand I transfer the deed or the deed from the property\nout of the real owner's name. I transfer it into her stolen identity. We then refinance the house\nlike three or four times. And so she starts going to\nthese different closings and she's, her name is Alison. And she's pretending to\nbe a Puerto Rican woman named Rosie Duprez. Alison has brown hair and blue eyes. Rosie Duprez clearly doesn't.\n- Yeah. - So Alison, when we make the\nID, she dyes her hair black, curls it a little bit and gets the pictures taken of herself. But before she goes to the\nfirst closing to get a check for like $100,000, we've got like three of these scheduled. She changes her hair color. Like she dyes it back like a dirty blonde. And she goes to the first closing and she gets a check, a\ncheck for 100,000 let's say, I don't know what it was, like 95 or 105, whatever, roughly $100,000. She gets a check at the\nclosing, they give it to her. We then go to the next closing. Well, at the next closing, the title person has her\nsign all the documents. But she's looking at her\nlike, something's not right. Looks at her ID, makes a\ncopy of the ID, looks at it and says, \"This doesn't look like you.\" And she's like, you know,\n\"You don't look Hispanic.\" And she's like, \"I'm half Hispanic. What, what do you, what?\" And she's like, \"You don't, I mean,\" but keep in mind the photograph was her. So she's saying, \"This\ndoesn't look like you,\" but it's her, granted she\nhad, you know, the curly hair a little bit, but that's it. So Alison is like, \"It's me.\" And she's like, \"Look, I'm\nnot gonna give, cut you. I'm not gonna give you the check.\" I'm gonna, let's just sign the documents. You know, we can get,\nyou can get the check. I'll let you know.\" So she goes, gets in my car. She said, \"Yeah, listen,\nthere's a problem.\" So we're driving down the\nroad, she explains it to me, I realize, you know, okay, that's done. It's over. We're not going back. She's like, \"What about\nthe other closing?\" \"No, no, no more closings. We're done.\" And you know, and it was\nprobably more of a yell, screaming and yelling. Like, \"What the hell did you do? I told you not to change your hair. Why would you change your hair?\" Like that, when she came\nin like, the day before. And I was like, \"What did\nyou do? What did you do?\" And she's like, \"I changed my hair. What's the big deal? It's still me.\" Sure enough. You know, and that's\nlike, it's not that I knew that that was gonna\nhappen, but why tempt fate? - How'd you meet Alison? Like, what was-\n- She was a mortgage broker. - Oh, okay.\n- And I had done some fraudulent, she needed, she worked for another mortgage company. Sorry, she worked for\nanother mortgage company. She couldn't get a loan closed. The owner of that\nmortgage company called me and said, \"Look, we got a\nloan, we need it closed.\" And I said, \"Great.\" And I, when guys would call me, I'd say, \"Great, I'll come pick it up. I'll give you a $300 or\na $500 referral fee.\" \"No, no, it's a couple\nhundred thousand dollars. We want to close it.\" \"Well, if you, then close it.\" \"Well, I can't close it. We need a W-2 or we\nneed this, we need that. We can't figure out how to do it.\" So I go over there and typically I convince\nthem, just give it to me, or it's not gonna close. She was, you'd have to see this chick. She was gorgeous. She was gorgeous. Very flirtatious. Made me feel like I was thin and handsome. So like, she gets whatever she wants. - Yeah.\n- So I'm like, \"Okay, look, here's what you do.\" And I explained to her,\ndo this, do this, do this. Send it here, it'll close. And we closed it. Well, then she starts calling me, right? \"Hey, how's it going?\" We go to lunch, next thing you know, we start sleeping together. She realizes what's happening. She says, \"I want in on this.\"\" So now we do the closings. We're on our way. I say, \"Look, that check's dead.\" She goes, 'What about the\nother, the other one?\" I go, \"No, no, it's all\ndead. We're walking away.\" Now, it was easy for me to say, because for me, I had money. She's going through a\ndivorce, she's broke. You know, like, none of this\ndid I take into consideration at the time, by the way, to me it's like, nah,\nthat's dead, we're done. We'll start over again. Well, and she's, to her, in her\nmind, she was about to make, we were getting probably that\nwas a million dollar scam. She was about to end up getting,\nyou know, whatever it was, half or one third of half a million\ndollars in the next week. Now she's got nothing. So, she says, \"Look, let's\nat least cash this one.\" And I had a buddy named Travis Hayes who had been, you know, we actually were, we've been friends since high school. We were like best friends, right? Really close friends in high school. We were still close. Travis was running a scam. This one, hers was in\nClearwater, his was in Orlando. So I'm all, I'm getting all over the state at this point, right? So he's running an Orlando scam that's already yielded\nhalf a million, maybe more. He's still pulling, we're still refinancing properties, right? So he's about to close on another half a million\ndollars worth of properties. He's got a bank account that's open. She says, \"Let's give it to Travis, have him deposit it in his account.\" He's already pulled out like\n300,000 out of the account. And she's like, \"Shouldn't be a problem.\" I was like, \"No, no, no.\" And\nshe goes, \"Let me call him.\" She calls him, I think I called him. And, and I explained the situation. He said, \"You think it's okay?\" And I said, \"No, I don't think it's okay. I don't think it's okay at all.\" And he's like, \"No, it's not a big deal. Just gimme the check.\" So I give him the check, he\ngoes, he deposits the check. They say they're gonna\nhold it till it clears. You know, that was kind\nof a thing back then. It takes, I don't know, I don't know how long it took. Five days, six days, whatever\nit was, he was supposed to go back and it would've cleared. And he would've been able\nto start pulling money out. And so I call him one day,\n'cause Alison's bugging me. So I call him and I go,\n\"Hey, where are you at?\" He goes, \"I'm actually\non my way to Orlando.\" And I said, \"Oh, okay, so you,\" \"But let Alison know I'm\nnot getting any money.\" He said, \"The bank manager called and said that because the check was over $100,000, they have to witness me\nendorsing the back of the check.\" Or they had to see my something, right? And for me to come in,\nI'm like, \"Whoa, whoa.\" I said, \"Something's\nwrong. Something's wrong. Don't go to the bank.\" \"What do you think's wrong?\" I go, \"I think the cops\nare waiting for you. That's what I think's wrong.\" And he goes, \"No, the cops aren't.\" He goes, \"Man, I'm in the\nparking lot right now. I just pulled into the\nparking lot. There's no cops.\" I'm like, \"They're not\ngonna be in squad cars.\" Like, and he's like,\n\"No.\" He said, \"It's fine. You're overreacting, bro.\" And I'll never forget what he said. He said, \"You're shaking like\na little girl, bro. Calm down. I got this. I'm cool with the manager.\" Like the manager, like, because you've chopped\nit up with the manager, he's gonna let your\nfraudulent check go through. So he walks in, the cops are\nin there, they locked the door. He just told me later, you\nknow, they closed the door, locked it, the cops are\nin there, they grab him and they bring him downtown. He didn't say anything. You\nknow, he won't say anything. That's not true, by the way. But he's, so here's what he told me. He wouldn't say anything. \"I told him, I ain't\ntalking to you, coppers.\" - Oh, he told.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] He told you, but\nhe actually did tell them. - He actually did talk to them. So, what he ends up doing, what ends up happening is we\ncan't get in touch with him. So we're calling and calling, calling. And then finally I decide, you know what, I'm not gonna call his cell phone anymore. I'm gonna call the name\nof the person he was, the synthetic identity's number, right? So I go and I call the\nsynthetic identity's number. I call and I say, somebody answers. And I go, \"Hey, is so-and-So there?\" And he said, and it's a\ngruff, authoritarian voice. You know, this is law enforcement. And he's like, \"No, who's this?\" He goes, \"No,\" he goes, \"No,\nthis is officer so-and-so who's this?\" And I go, I was like, \"This\nis Lee Black,\" I said. He said, he goes, \"How\ndo you know so-and-so?\" I was like, \"Oh, no, no,\"\nclick. And I just hung up. And I called from like a payphone. So I turned around and I\nsaid, \"He got arrested.\" And then later on that night, he showed up on the county website, you\nknow, the arrest website showing he had been arrested. And the next day he calls me and he asks me to get him outta jail. Like, \"Hey, I, you gotta go.\" So I have to give his\nbrother-in-law money, you know, we get him outta jail. He actually got out.\n- For bail? - Yeah, he got out for like nothing. And here's what I should have known. Like he was cooperating. It went from like $300,000\nbond down to like $10,000. So it's 1,000 bucks. So right then, I didn't know it at\nthe time, but obviously that means we're gonna let him outta jail. He's cooperating. So\nthey let him outta jail. I go and I get him a lawyer, a state, this was state by the\nway, it wasn't federal. So I get him a lawyer for like $15,000. He come, you know, he comes, you know, of course he tells me, \"Look, they asked me a bunch of questions. I told him that, you know, he made up some story about he's working with another guy, but he\ndoesn't know the guy's name. He made up a name. Like there's a whole, he\nhas this whole kind of thing where he tells them about me, but not me. And he's like, and the,\nyou know, the numbers, none of the numbers led anywhere. So they all lead to cell phones that are only being used for those scams. So it's a dead alley or blind alley. And I'm like, \"Okay, okay.\" And I'm mean, I'm paying him\nlike he's coming in, \"Man, my truck's no good. I need another truck.\"\nI buy him another truck. \"Hey man, my electric's\ngonna get turned off. And I don't have. Oh, I need $1,000.\" \"Of course. Here's $1,000. I don't know what I was, I'm\nembarrassed you had to ask, here's 1,000,\" you know? And a week later, you know,\nhe needs 2,000 for this, 1,000 for this, 2,000 for this. He wants to start a tree trimming company. He needs to buy a tree\ntrimmer. \"How much are those?\" \"5,000,\" of course, that's fine, 10.\" So I give him another 25,000, starts like a tree trimming business, which he runs to this day, what I don't know is that,\nyou know, the whole time he's actually working with a task\nforce that's been put together. - Federal, or?\n- This is state at this point. It's a state task force, 'cause there's multiple\ncounties involved at this point. And it wasn't hard for him to\nexplain like this comes back to \"Reservoir Dogs.\" I got a much, all he had\nto say to the officers was, \"Listen, you gotta let me go. I can't do any prison time. I'm gonna tell you about\na much, much bigger scam.\" And they go, \"Okay, well how\ncan you prove that scam?\" \"Pull up Hillsborough County, Hillsborough County's\ntax appraiser website. Okay, look up the name James Red. Look, all of these were\nbought six months ago. Six months later, they're\nall in foreclosure. Pull up Lee Black. All of these were bought. Look, six months later, all\nof them are foreclosure. Hey, pull up James Red. You know pull up Brandon Green, pull up.\" So all of these are going in foreclosed. I mean, it's so, it's like, you know, that what I thought was so cute, not cute. It was just stupid. And so he very quickly, they\nput together a task force. He's working with them on the task force. And, we're still buying houses, flipping houses, doing everything, 'cause I believe him. I believe he's not, you know, he's saying, \"Look, if I have to go to jail\nfor, you know, a year or so, like, you know, and he\nis also paying, you know, he hasn't paid them back yet. But we're saying he can pay them back. Like it's like, \"Look, if we\nget to the point, you know, when we get to that point,\nlike we'll pay them back,\" but we haven't paid him back yet, 'cause we have no way to show\nwhere that money came from. We can always go to like\none of his relatives and give his dad 40 grand, give his mom 20 grand, you\nknow, that kind of stuff. And start putting money that way. And all that money was\ntaken out in cash too. So we could always show up with\na chunk in cash regardless, you know, it's still in the process. And I think that we're\nstill in the process and it could be six months or a year away, 'cause it's a slow\nthing, I've already been through the process my\nfirst time when I got in trouble and it was a year. But from the time that I was spoken to until I pled guilty and was sentenced. So I'm not concerned about it. Well that's happening. We're still flipping properties. And one day,"

Everybody.\n- Guys that, you know, these aren't all like, you\nknow, construction workers or guys that work in, you know,\nor mechanics or something. These are like the legitimate,\nthese are legitimate people that have credit problems\nor whatever the case may be. So one day I'm sitting at work and I'd been getting phone calls for the prior week from people\nat title companies saying, \"Hey, Matt, wanted to let you know we just had some subpoenas\nserved on several of your files.\" And I'm concerned, like\nthat had me concerned. Then a guy named Jeff Testerman\nstarts making phone calls. Jeff Testerman is a reporter\nfor the \"St. Petersburg Times.\" He's calling people saying, \"Hey, I know, noticed that\nyou sold a piece of property to Lee Black, have you\never met Mr. Black?\" He assumes like, and they're\nlike just hanging up on him or saying, \"No, I don't know\nwhat you're talking about. I'm not sure what that guy's\nname was. Lemme call you back.\" And I'm getting phone calls from people.

I know that there are\nsubpoenas being served and I'm nervous, you\nknow, I'm very concerned.

So he walks in, I go, \"Steve,\"\nI said, \"What's going on?\" He said, and usually he's\njolly and laughs and stuff. And he goes, and he says, \"I\ngotta talk to you outside.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" I\nwalk outside, \"What's up?\" And he says, \"I used to\ndate this girl in the like the Tampa Police\nDepartment or something, right?\" And I was like, \"Okay.\" He said, \"She showed up\nat my house this morning at like six o'clock in the morning.\" And I went, \"Okay.\" He said, \"She said that she's\nbeen working on a task force. And he said, apparently one\nof your buddies got arrested in Orlando, they're investigating some other thing in Clearwater. They're investigating a ton of properties here in Ybor, Tampa Heights. And I mean there's like a\nhundred properties involved. And my name came up because you've sold some\nproperties to me,\" which I had. And, and he is like, \"So she came to me and said, 'Look, your\nbuddy Cox,'\" he said, and I go, I was like, \"Okay.\" He goes, he said, \"Well,\nthe task force is on you. And she said to stop talking to you because they're gonna come\narrest you in a couple days. They just handed over\nthe task force findings to the FBI and the FBI is\ngoing to come arrest you in a couple days. And she said not to talk to you because you're going to cooperate and because all white\ncollar guys cooperate. So she thinks you're gonna cooperate and not to talk to you, 'cause she's afraid you're\ngonna get me hemmed up. And she said, just to walk away.\" And he was like, \"So I\nthought you should know.\" And I was like, \"Okay.\" And he said, \"What are you gonna do? I said, \"Oh, I'm, you know, I don't,\" well first he said, \"What should I do?\" And I go, \"Tell them,\ntell them that I arranged all the loans for you. You came in, you signed the paperwork, I filled out all the documents,\nyou signed the paperwork, you know, I arranged everything.\" I'm like, \"You're not a mortgage broker. You don't know if this is legit. Like you sign, you have perfect credit. You signed the paperwork, you walked away with a check for 30,000. You don't know.\"\n- Yep. - And he was like, 'cause he\ndidn't, 'cause he had a job. He was a sheriff's deputy. Like, I'm not a, you know. I went in, I applied for a loan at a bank. They said, \"We can buy,\nyou can buy the house and we'll give you $30,000.\" So of course I'm gonna do that. You know, that's not gonna happen. But he doesn't know and\nI said, \"Just tell them, yeah, tell him you'll\ncooperate like, absolutely.\" He goes, \"What are you\ngonna do? I said, \"Me?\" I said, \"I'm leaving, bro. I'm leaving.\" I said, \"I can't stay\nhere. I can't go to prison. Like, I was just sentenced. I'm on federal probation right now. Like, the judge isn't gonna be cool with me getting popped again. Like, I mean, I can't do it. Can't do it.\" I said, \"I'm leaving. Can't go to prison. I'm adorable, bro. Like, you know, I can't, I\nsaw \"Shawshank Redemption.\" I know what's gonna happen. I can't.\"\n- You're too good looking. - Yeah, I can't do that.\nThat's not gonna happen. Like, I can't, you know, I can't, I'm not gonna defend myself against a guy who's six foot three and tatted up. No, so, and you know, and I can't, I'm no benefit to a gang. Like, I'm not, I'm a\nnonviolent, you know, soft, white collar criminal. So I was just like, I was like, \"Yeah, I'm leaving, bro, I'm leaving.\" So I actually went home. Well actually, I was able to, I started cutting checks to people, right? So I cut checks to Alison, to Johnny, to like, everybody I could think of. Here's 5,000, here's 7,000, here's 8,000, here's six, here's nine. And had them going to all\nthese different bank accounts, pulling out cash. But this is like a\nThursday at four o'clock. So the next day they show up with cash, write some more checks, they go again. I get about 80 grand in\ncash. That's all I can get. I go home that night, I start packing my bags and I was dating this\nchick named Rebecca Hauck. We've been dating about a month. And she shows up at my house. You know, I hadn't returned\nour phone calls all day, and apparently we're supposed to go out and I'd forgotten about\nit, I had bigger issues. And so I'm packing a couple of\nduffle bags and she walks in and she's like, 'What's going on?\" I'm like, \"I'm leaving.\" \"Where are you going? I thought we were supposed\nto go out and such and do something tonight.\" I'm like, \"I'm leaving. It's over.\" And she says, \"What happened?\" And I tell her what happened,\nthis is what happened. She's like, \"Oh my God.\"\nLike she had no idea. - Oh, she had no idea about\nanything you were doing? - No, I barely knew her. Like, I mean, she's coming over two, three times a week for a month. Like, I've, you know, this isn't\nlove, this isn't, you know, this is a booty call. That's all it is, like, we're hanging out, we're having sex and that's it. I don't even know you, so, she suddenly just begs to come with me. \"You gotta bring me with you. You have to this, you have to that.\" I'm like, \"What are you talking about? Like, you've got a son, you have your mom lives here, your,\" and she's just in tears and crying. And she suddenly said, and this is what's so funny about it is that she had just moved\nfrom Vegas to St. Petersburg to work at the dog track,\nto work for a company that owned the dog track, right? The, a casino interest or a, yeah, like a gambling company. And she said, \"You don't\neven know why I'm here.\" I was like, \"Okay, why are you here?\" She said, \"I'm here because\nI was working for a law firm that worked for the casino\ncompany that I worked for.\" She said, I got caught\nembezzling like nothing. It was like 10 or $15,000 from my boss,\" because she had a gambling habit. And she said, \"He didn't call the police because we were sleeping together and he was afraid his\nwife would find out.\" She said, \"So instead, he banished me here to St. Pete. My son just came to live with me.\" He's been caught sneaking out because the father had raised him. He'd only been living with\nher since she got to Florida. And she's like, \"I was about,\nI was gonna send him back. He's failing school. He's smoking pot. He's been caught sneaking\nout after curfew.\" I'm like, \"Oh, okay. I didn't,\nI don't know any of this.\" She's like, \"He was going\nback in December,\" you know, or no, he was going back\nafter the school year, which would've been like, May. Okay, and I'm like, so where before five minutes earlier, I thought she was this sweet secretary, sweet innocent secretary\nand she's like, you know, \"I've been married three times. I am a gambler. I've claimed bankruptcy. I'm sleeping with my old boss.\" I got like, you know, she\nwent from this, you know, thieving, adulteress, you know, and I thought, these are\nall really beneficial to my, you know, my future plans. - Yeah.\n- You know, and I shouldn't have at that moment, you know, I was so just\nflipped out and concerned and up and leaving your life and everything you know, behind. That's terrifying. And you know, and so now you're alone in a strange place in a place you've- - Is that the first time you've\ndone something like that? Like leave to go on the road? - Yes, so I'd never just up and moved and keep in mind now, I can't call home. I can't, like, I'm leaving. There are things that I\nfeel like get you caught. And every, you know, I've\nwatched tons of these TV shows and, you know, there are certain\nthings that get you caught. And you know, one of them\nis keeping in contact with anybody in your old life. So I'm thinking that's not gonna happen. Like, I'm not contacting anybody. I'm leaving and that's it.\nThat didn't really happen. I kept in touch, I called my\nmom every once in a while, but I was like, \"Okay, that's cool.\" - Did the loneliness of\nthat hit you early on or no? Like the, as you were packing?\n- I never, I never did. Well- - You're leaving your life. I mean, there's a, it feels like a fundamental transition. - Oh, listen. You think? I mean, listen, not just that. Like, I'm leaving my son, I have a son and I am, you know, I\nwas leaving everything. I was just terrified of going to prison. And, you know, I mean, I don't know, it was just, it was just so stupid. It was just arrogance. And, you know, I should have stayed, like, I made things so much worse. But I also thought I'm smart. I can figure this out. Like\nI can change my identity. Blend in. I'll be fine. - Aren't you already, like, people know what your face looks like? - They do. They do. But I, one of the first things I did was I got plastic surgery. - [Lex] What kind of plastic surgery? - I've got a nose job. I got what they call a mini facelift. They go in through your back of your ears and they suck out all\nthe fat in your neck. - [Lex] Does that change appearance much? - A little bit. I got, I was balding. I got a two hair transplants,\nyou know, two hair grafts. So the hair in my head,\nthis isn't my hair, it's my hair, but it's from back here. So there's, they cut it from here and they.\n- It looks great. - I appreciate it. So they reimplanted it there,\nyou know, got liposuction, just some, you know, other stuff and, you know, got my teeth\ndone, that sort of thing, you know, so, you know, and\nthat was kind of like my plan. I'll go, I'll take off, I got 80 grand, I'll steal some more money, you know, but I let her come with me and we ran up all my credit\ncards over the next few days, packed up the car, traded in my Audi and got like an Audi, I\ndon't know, was it like an A6 or like a four door like the\nbig four door, whatever it was. Got that and drove straight to Atlanta. And, so I wrote a letter to my parents before I left, just explaining,\nthis is what's happening. I'm leaving, I'm done. I'm\nnot going to prison. Love you. Sorry.\n- Sorry. - Sorry, sorry, I know I'm a\ndisappointment. Sorry. Bam. So I take off, go to Atlanta."

      "section": "Identity theft",
      "text": "When we went to Atlanta,\nI already had the name of a guy named Scott Cugno that I'd done a loan for. So I had his, you know, his\nvital information, right? Like I have his name, date of\nbirth, Social Security number, mother's maiden name,\nand where he was born. One day we were having a conversation and I just slowly pried\nall that out of him, right? Like, I already, we'd done a loan for him. So already had his name, date of birth, Social Security number. But I need to steal his identity. I need to know where he was born and his mother's maiden name. So through the course of a\nconversation, I just pried, you know, hey, \"You know, Cugno is that, you know, what is that? Is that like Irish? Is it?\" \"No, it's such and such.\" \"Oh, what's your mom's name?\" \"Oh, such and such.\" \"Oh, okay.\" - Yeah.\n- You know? \"Oh, were you born here? Or you born in, weren't you from?\" \"No, man, I was born\nhere, I was born in such,\" \"Oh,\" Hillsborough County. You know, like, I, so it was no big deal. We get to Atlanta, I make\na fake ID for both of us, but keep in mind, I don't have, like, I don't have a driver's license. I do, but they're fake. Like, I can't give this to a cop. Can't give a driver's license\nthat says David Freeman. - What's David's residence?\nFlorida or is this Georgia? - No, this is Florida. Okay.\nBut it was just a made up name. - Okay.\n- I'd gone to like high school with a kid named David Freeman. So I had an ID, but I\ncan't give that to a cop. Like, that's enough to\nget like rent a place or do something or.\n- Yeah. - So we go, go to Atlanta, make an ID, set it up,\nmake some business cards, set up a couple websites,\nset up some, get a HQ, which is that like a,\nit's a company that will, you can do virtual, you can rent virtual, you can rent offices. And they'll answer your phone for like a hundred bucks a\nmonth and they'll forward them. So it seems like you have\nan office and they'll, you know, they give you a\nphone number that you call up and they say, you know,\n\"Hi, United Southern Bank,\" you know, and they'll answer\nthe phone and forward messages. So we get one of those, make\na business card for Becky, she rents a house from a\nguy named Michael Shanahan. So we rent Michael Shanahan's\nhouse, it's like $200,000, $200,000 house in Alpharetta. And I then go to Alabama, wait, I then order Scott\nCugno's birth certificate, Social Security card. I think I registered to vote in his name. And I made a lease agreement in his name and I think that's all I needed. And then I went to Alabama and got a driver's license in his name. So I went into the DMV, give\nthem all these documents and which are, almost all of them are real except for the lease. They said, \"Sit over there,\"\nI sit over there, I sit down, boom, 20 minutes later I\nhave a driver's license. It's, you know, it's 20 something\ndollars. It was nothing. So I get the driver's license. Now I'm driving this, I'm still\ndriving a car that, an Audi that is in the name of Matt Cox. So I parked that. I then go get Social Security to issue me a Social Security number in the name's Scott Cugno. And I then turn around\nand I go and I get a loan. You put down 20, 30%,\nthere's all these first time or first time buyers, 30% down, rent, get like a Honda or something. So now we're living in a house,\nwe've got some furniture, bedroom furniture and I go downtown, I pull the title to this guy,\nMichael Shanahan's house, and I go downtown and I\nsatisfy the loan on his house. So he had two loans with Bank of America. And so I create two satisfaction of loans from Bank of America. So Michael Shanahan owns a house in the name Michael Shanahan. He has one mortgage with Bank\nof America and a second one. When you pay your mortgage off the way public records knows\nit's paid off is they mail public records, a\nSatisfaction of Mortgage. It's a one page document\nand it's notarized. - [Lex] So you've got two of those. - I filled out two, I created two of them. I just ordered, you know,\nyou can do research. So when I went downtown, I researched Bank of America\nSatisfaction of Mortgages and you know, thousands show up. So I just grab a couple of them and now I know what the basic template is. They're all, and they're\nall different by the way. So it's, you know, it's not\nlike you even have to be that close, but whatever. I mimicked, some of them,\norder, I had a notary stamp. Not hard to get, you\nknow, you just, you go in and you go into three different, you know, office Depots and you say, \"Hey, I need a notary stamp.\" And you give them the information\nand you come back four day or whatever, a week later\nand they give it to you. So I've got these notary stamps. So I notarize the Satisfactions,\nI go downtown, I file them, boom, the mortgages are gone. Keep in mind, Bank of America, he's still paying the mortgages. They don't know that\nthey've been satisfied in public records. They're not notified. So those are gone, but it takes about a month\nor two for it to show up. Atlanta was that far behind. I think it was Fulton County,\nthey were just way behind. So we just kind of have to\ndick around for a while, right? So we're going on little\nvacations, we're going to New Orleans, we're\ngoing to different places as Scott Cugno, driving\na car as Scott Cugno. We open up several bank accounts, we have multiple bank accounts, and then we end up going to Vegas. And we don't get, we do go to Vegas. But what happened was\nwe were driving around and I remember thinking, telling her, I was like, you know, \"This is a problem. Like, we have to get real IDs, real driver's licenses. I mean, this is real, but\nthis is a real person too. And he may stumble across it.\" And so what I did was\nI started running ads in magazines saying, \"Home loans available, good\ncredit, bad credit, no problem. Call now, government loans,\"\nyou know, \"Government, you know, VA, FHA finance,\"\nyou know, whatever. \"Call this number.\" So people start calling and\nI'm getting their information. One of the guys I got was Michael Eckert. Yeah, I remember Michael\nEckert, poor Michael Eckert. I actually legally changed his name to Michael Johnson at one point, but at this point it\nwas just Michael Eckert. So I don't, I wanted to see, you know, I'm bored. I want to see what the process is. How much does it cost? Is this possible? Lemme see if I can change this guy's name. It was, it was 1500 bucks, I changed it. - Without him ever showing up anywhere. So you can fake-\n- Well, I have a driver's license in his name. - Right.\n- I am him. So he did show up. He showed up at the lawyer's office. He, so, you know.\n- Right. - So I'm, so I do that. I'm living in the house and\nwe're driving along one day and I'm saying, \"Man, we gotta\nget real, like these people that are calling, like that one guy, I get his information,\nbut during the course of taking the application,\nand I'm asking like these, these government survey\nquestions, at the very end, there's like 20 questions\nand I'm rambling them off. And at some point he was\nlike, he said he volunteered. Like I didn't, I never even asked anybody about criminal history. And he just, he ended up saying something, \"Well, I do have a\nfelony, does that matter?\" I mean, he's like, he was, \"I mean, it was a DUI, I've had a couple DUIs, but I got my license back.\" And that was part of the\nreason he had bad credit. And it was like, okay, no,\nnope, it doesn't matter. Don't worry. I'm thinking\nyou're not getting a loan. So this is, I'm just taking your, I'm just stealing from you,\nsharing your information. So I get all this\ninformation, I'm gathering it. And so one of the things I said to Becky while we are sitting\nat this stoplight is I'm like, \"We gotta get real\npeople's real information.\" And I said, \"Like for instance,\" I said, \"What if I steal somebody's identity? I get a driver's license in his name, four states from where he lives and he gets a DUI? I could get pulled over two years later and get arrested for a DUI\nthat he got in Florida.\" And she's like, \"Well, what\ndo you, what are you thinking? Are you thinking like criminals or are you thinking like, like prisoners, like mental patients?\" Like, and I went, \"I mean,\nI don't,\" and I looked over and there was a homeless\nguy holding a sign. And I went, \"Like that guy.\" And I'll never forget, she\ngoes, she says, \"The hobo?\" like, I don't know who calls them hobos. And she's like, \"The hobo?\"\nI said, \"Yes, that guy.\" I said, \"Hold on.\" Pulled over to a Subway, got out, she went inside to get Subway. I walk across the street,\npulled out like 20 bucks and I said, \"Hey bro, can I ask you some quick\nquestions real quick?\" He's like, \"Yeah, what's up?\" And I go, \"Here's 20\nbucks.\" I said, \"Listen.\" I said, \"When was the last time you were gainfully employed?\" He's like, \"Ah, whatever. 10 years.\" I'm like, \"Oh, okay, do you\nhave a criminal record?\" He's like, \"Ah, I've been arrested and misdemeanors like,\nyou know, vagrancy,\" and he names off some things, you know, drunk in public, whatever. And I was like, \"Are you on probation?\" He goes, \"I can't do probation. They don't give us probation.\nThey keep us for 90 days. They release us. Like they,\nthe judge knows I can't do, I'm not gonna show up for a probation.\" I'm like, \"Okay, do you\nhave a driver's license?\" He's like, \"Maybe, I don't think so. I think it's just,\" I go,\n\"Is it, did you get DUI?\" He's like, \"No, I think\nit's just expired.\" \"Do you have a driver's license with you?\" He's like, \"No, I got nothing.\" I'm like, \"Okay, well, you know,\" he told me he lived in\nlike a tent in the woods. And so I gave him like another 20 bucks, asked him a few more\nquestions and then, oh, and I remember in the middle\nof it, he said, he goes, \"What, are you taking\na survey or something?\" And I went, I remember thinking, I go and I think, I go, I kind of chuckle. I go, \"You get a lot of\nsurveyors out here?\" like that. And he goes, \"Yeah, and sometimes.\" And I was like, \"Really?\" He goes, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"Like, the,\" he\nsaid, \"People from like, you know, halfway houses\"\nand what did he say? \"Social workers and stuff. They'll come out and they'll, you know, they'll pass out stuff and they'll ask us questions and stuff.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, okay.\" And I was like, I thought\nthat's good to know. So I go back, I get, grab\nBecky and she's like, \"Oh,\" she's like, \"Did\nyou give him money?\" I said, \"I gave him like 40\nor 60 bucks or something.\" Forget what and she was like, \"That's, what a waste of\nmoney,\" I thought that was good. That was money well spent. I said, \"That guy's perfect.\" I said, \"That guy is, he's got everything. He has no way to be contacted. He has no documentation on him.\" I said, \"He's not gonna drive a car. He's not gonna get a DUI,\nhe has an expired license. I just have to get his license\nreinstated and I can be him.\" So I went home. I typed up a, what I called a federal statistical survey form. And I made a little thing.\nI mean, I went online. I mean, I'm always filling out federal documents as a mortgage broker. So it looked identical. I mean, I had like this little,\nlike the recycle symbol. And it was like, you know,\n\"Federal Form 17017,\" you know. And so I print out these forms. I get a clip, go buy a clipboard. I make a little a Salvation\nArmy ID, I pin it on me. And I go out and I start-\n- Doing surveys. - I start surveying homeless people. Don't judge me, bro. I was in a bad spot. I was in a bad spot. I see the\njudgment. I see the judgment. Let's maintain civility here. Like stay neutral. Stay neutral. - So these homeless\nguys, I mean, they have, they have a Social Security number. They have a birth certificate, I guess. I mean, they're a real person. - Right.\n- They're a real person with- - They're just not\nusing their real person. - Yeah, they're not\nactively, yeah, engaging with the economic system,\nthe financial system. They're not employed. They don't have housing, all that kind of. - They don't file taxes. They don't. So I, one of the questions\nI even asked the guy at the, one of the last questions,\nI said, \"Do you believe that you will be gainfully employed within the next two years?\" Every one of them said, no, no, no. So, you know, it was like, okay, they're not even, they're not even trying. And they all had alcohol problems or honestly, the few of them I talked to like was pretty clear. I mean, it takes literally five minutes, less than five minutes\nto fill out the form. And I filled it out for him, of course. But even filling it out in that brief, just asking questions back\nand forth, half of them, you could tell you've\ngot some mental illness, like something's not right with you. Like, these aren't guys\nthat are gonna go out and get, are going to get jobs. They're not cleaning up. So they were perfect for my purposes, as horrible\nas I know that sounds, so. - Do you feel bad about\nthis little small tangent? - No. Do I feel bad about it? - The homeless people in society are really, it's a difficult life. Like dealing with mental illness, dealing with drug addiction,\nall that kind of stuff. - I mean, listen, being in prison and then the kind, the people\nthat are in prison that, you know, are going to be homeless or have been homeless,\nor the mental illness that I've dealt with in halfway houses and even doing this, I don't know what you\ndo with these people. I don't even know that you house them. You can't necessarily\neven house them together. You know, they, they cause such problems. Like, I don't know what the solution is other than just kind of\nkeeping them fed maybe and keep them away from\nnormal people, you know, so they don't cause crime or whatever. I don't know about\nhousing them in one area. That seems like a mistake. Like there is absolutely no\ngood solution to that problem. None, because it's not like, \"Hey, if, if we gave you a house or we gave you job training and we gave you this,\"\nokay, you might get 5%. - Yeah.\n- 10. But most of them are on the street because they've just messed up\nover and over and over again. And they just kind of gave up. - But, you know, I guess\nwe still have to remember that they're human beings. I mean, we mentioned off\nMike \"Soft White Underbelly,\" and he highlights the humanity of people who've had\na real difficult life. He does it well. - He's, Mark Laita is\namazing. He's amazing. And one of the things he had\nsaid was like, these are, he was like, \"These are real people.\" And he's like, \"Their stories.\" He's like, \"They have stories\nand they need,\" you know, but if you also talk to\nMark, he'll tell you, you can't just, you can't give them money. You can't, like, you can't. Like, he's tried every\ntime he's reached out and tried to help these\nguys, put them in apartments, fed them, got them back on their feet, within six months they're back on, they're back on the\nstreet, I mean, it just, it just happens over\nand over and over again. I mean, I think the amount\nof money that would have to be dumped into correcting\nthat problem, I don't know. I mean, you can say, \"Well, yeah, but just, you know, you should do it because it's the right thing to do.\" I don't know who's paying for it. - It's complicated. But for your purpose, they\nhave a Social Security number. - [Matt] They got 20 bucks. They seemed very happy.\n- There you are with a clipboard, taking a survey. - Right, took a survey, went home, ordered their, and they, you know, of course they give me everything. Name, date of birth,\nSocial Security number, mother's maiden name,\nwhere they were born. Have they ever been in the armed services? Have they ever had a passport issued? What states have they\nhad identification in? Have they ever been arrested?\nThey ever been on probation? Have they ever claimed\nSocial Security Disability, SSI mean I had like 17 questions and it absolutely answered everything. What high school did you go to? 'Cause high school transcripts\nare great for documentation. A lot of times they'll ask\nyou for high school, you know, can you get us a copy of\nyour high school transcripts? Like, that's good to know. And I'm a big believer in overkill. So I mean, I ordered a ton of stuff. If I needed three things to get a driver's license\nin your name, right? You know, I'd come in with like six, 'cause what you do is you get\nin front of the guy at the DMV and you kind of fumble through like, \"Oh, I got this, what else do you need?\" You know, I know exactly what you need. But you know, they'll be like, \"Oh, was that high school transcript? Yeah, I'll take that, and what, oh, voter's registration card, gimme that. Yeah, that's, you're perfect. You're good. Sit down right over. There's it.\" You know.\n- Who is by the way, lurking in the shadows\ntrying to catch you? You've mentioned FBI, secret Service. - Oh yeah.\n- You mentioned, I think I've heard you\nmentioned US Marshals, which is interesting, cops\nin general, the police, CIA, I guess CIA is international only.\n- Yeah. - FBI is internal.\n- Yes. - Okay, well, so who is,\nwhen you're doing this, who are you afraid of? - So by the time I've gotten to Atlanta, within four or five days,\nthe FBI raided my office. I guess I kind of missed that. - Back in Florida.\n- Back in Florida, when I left and drove to Atlanta and left, remember the FBI was gonna\nshow up a few days later, they were gonna arrest me.\n- And they did. - They did. They showed up like I left on\na Sunday night or something. Because for some reason in\nmy stupid thought, I thought, well, they won't arrest me on the weekend. Like, they don't work on the weekends. So they came on like a,\nwhatever, it was like a Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday,\nlike within a few days, they come in the office,\nthey raid it, they're looking for me, but I'm gone. Nobody knows where I am. And so now I'm surveying the homeless guys and I turn around and I'm\nordering their documents. And as their documents\nare showing up, you know, I'm going to different\nstates and getting IDs, so I'm going to Florida. So over the course of\nthis whole thing, I've had 27 driver's licenses in\nlike seven different states. I've had two dozen passports. Because if you're gonna\nget the driver's license in the guy's name, you might as well get, or an ID even, you might\nas well get a passport. 'Cause a passport's not difficult to get, they don't fingerprint you,\nyou know, all they look, all they're doing is\nsaying, \"This is your ID and were you born here?\" And then they run a check\nand if it comes back or it doesn't, and back then\nyou could do it expedited. And I'd have it in like two weeks. Like now it takes like 90 days or 60 to 90 days to get one, but- - And if you have multiple\nideas for a single identity, that's more proof, like, right.\n- Right. - So wait, what number\ndid you say? How many? How many IDs, how many identities? - So I had, well I've\nhad over 50 identities. But I've had 27 driver's licenses issued from state DMVs, department\nof Motor Vehicles. - So, like, legitimately,\n- Legitimately, I walked into the DMV, said,\n\"Hi, my name's Michael Eckert, and I just moved here about\nthree weeks ago, four weeks ago. Here's my lease. And here, I lost my driver's license, bro. Like, I don't know what I\ndid with it. I don't know. I don't know what happened.\nI don't, I don't know.\" And they're like, \"It's all\nright. What do you have? Do you have, I need a proof of residency.\" \"Well, I have my lease.\"\n\"Oh, okay. I need a primary.\" \"Okay, here's my birth certificate.\" \"Okay, and I need a secondary.\" \"Here's my Social Security card. But I also registered, you\nknow, I registered to vote. My girlfriend made me vote immediately. And she said I would need\nit,\" \"Oh yeah, that's perfect. You're, you're good. I\ndon't even need that.\" \"Okay, great.\" \"Stand over\nthere. Pay that person.\" They call your number, \"275,\" you know, 45 minutes later you go,\nyou pay your 25 bucks, you stand in front of the\nscreen, they take a picture, you got a driver's license, you walk out, it's still warm, it's beautiful. It smells like pop plastic. It's amazing. And so I'm opening up\ndifferent bank accounts in these guys' names and just about- - [Lex] What do you, yeah, sorry. Well, what are you mostly\ndoing with the identities? You opening up different bank accounts? - Right now?\n- Are you doing a credit starting to establish credit or no? - Some of them, like I\nmight order, I might order secured credit cards,\nso I can't get credit. You know, I'm building their credit. Like it's not helping me in any way. I'm just sending out $500\nto get a Capital One card or a American, I'm sorry, a Bank of America secured\ncredit card, whatever. So I'm building their\ncredits, but not all of them. Only a few because I'm collect, although I'm collecting them,\nI'm also gonna be moving soon. I'm only here to get a few hundred thousand dollars and move. I need some kind of a base. So I don't wanna start\ngetting credit cards and building up a history in\nAtlanta in anybody's name. But I am getting driver's\nlicenses in other states. So I've made a, like North\nCarolina, South Carolina."

      "text": "- What's the primary\nmethod of income here? When you move to a place? South Carolina? How do you make 100,000\nat this at this time? - Oh, well, I'm in, right now, I'm living in this guy's house\nand I satisfied his loans. The house is worth 200,000.\n- Got it. So what happens is, one day we go and we check public records. Remember I told you it takes months for it to show up and it shows up. He's got no mortgages on the house. So now I'm, I turn around and I make a fake ID in\nthe name Michael Shanahan, and I'm living in his\nhouse, but I have no credit. Right, there's no credit. So I've got a, the ID, I've\ngot a Social Security number and I order some secure\ncredit cards in his name. So if you pull that\ncredit profile, it does, it shows up saying he's\ngot some credit cards, but it's, they've only, they're\nonly a month or two old. So I can't go to like Bank of America. I mean, I could, but I needed to get the money as quick as possible. Like I wanna get out of Atlanta. So, and at this point, by the way, there's multiple articles\nshowing up in Tampa. So the \"St. Petersburg Times\" is writing multiple articles about me. - With your face.\n- With my picture. Yeah, but it's, honestly, it's pre, I mean not pre-internet,\nbut, it's post-internet, but it's in its infancy. Like no, nobody's, it's not huge. And honestly, it's a local newspaper in Tampa. It's not that big of a deal. Like I'm not concerned about\nthat so much at this point. What I'm concerned about\nis getting a chunk of money and just moving on and kind\nof re-establishing ourselves in a better way where we're\nnot living in a building that we're going to be committing\nfraud in with our house. So, but I'm living in this place. I make a fake ID in the\nname Michael Shanahan. And I call up three secured, or sorry, three hard money lenders. A hard money lender is a\nguy that lends his own money or other investors' money on\nproperty, kinda like a bank. But he's lending his own\nmoney so he doesn't have to really meet the banking requirements and he can charge a much\nhigher interest rate. These guys are charging 12,\n13% interest, simple interest. And they're only lending\nyou a much lower percentage of the value of your home. So they're not lending\nyou 90% of the value, they're lending you 65%, 60%. So I call three of these guys. They all come out to the\nhouse at different times. And each one of them says,\n\"I'll lend you 100,000. Or it's like 150,000, 150. Like they all lend roughly 150,000. So we schedule three separate closings. None of them know about the other person. So what I do is I close one loan on, let's say Monday and then one on Tuesday, and then went on whatever\nWednesday or Thursday, or that may have all been the same day, to be honest, but I don't remember. The point is, I go to three\nseparate title companies or real estate attorneys, and we close and I get checks for, you know,\nafter cost and everything. The total ends up being roughly 400,000. So I've got 400,000, Becky\nand I run another scam in Tallahassee, Florida. And we get like 50 grand. And plus we, the 80s dwindled\ndown to close to nothing 'cause we, we had gone\non several vacations. We went to like Bermuda and\nI think we went to Jamaica. We actually stayed at the Ritz in Jamaica. So it was very nice.\n- You and Becky. So Becky turned out to be pretty good in terms of scams on the road. - No, she was useless. She was horrible. And she just spent money all the time. And by the, what I realized too, very quickly is she's bipolar. So she's bipolar and she's absolutely, you know, insane. She smokes pot all the time. - Did that matter for you personally or did it actually affect\nthe, how good you were able to do these particular scams? - It was that she was the type of person that would start an argument\nat one o'clock in the morning. And scream at the top of her\nlungs and get the cops called. - Okay.\n- So I can't have the police called, I can't get taken downtown\nand fingerprinted. I can't have the police showing up. I don't know who's really, who's looking. We haven't had plastic\nsurgery at this point. We're still pulling money together, so- - [Lex] Oh, Becky. - Yeah, Becky's a problem. And at some point I\nactually, we send her to a, like a psychiatrist and they give her, they put her on Zoloft and\nshe takes it for like a month or two and then she stops taking it. She thought she was all better. Like, you're not all better. - So, can you gimme a timeline here? How long are you able to be\non the road here successfully? - Three years.\n- Three years? - This is me. This is the first few months.\n- Three years. - Well, so, yeah.\n- Three years. - What happens is we get\nthat little chunk of money, we put it deposited\ninto these bank accounts and we start pulling out cash and, which works out fine\n'cause we've got a bunch of accounts and we're pulling\nout little amounts, 7,000, 5,000, 8,000. And, you know, I would cash\nchecks against her accounts and they would call her to verify, \"Oh, is there's someone here trying\nto cash a check for $9,000?\" You know, \"Can you verify the payee?\" And they'd go, \"Oh yeah,\nthat's Scott Cugno.\" \"Oh, okay, thank you.\"\nAnd they'd cash the check. You know, these are new\naccounts, so it looks odd. But, you know, we are\nalways, I open the account. So what ends up happening is, we're cashing them and I remember getting really frustrated 'cause\nit was just taking forever. And I had gone into a bank one time, and you know, they have\nbanks where that they cash, they actually cash, like large checks. Like if you go into Bank\nof America and you try and cash a check for $15,000 or 25,000, they probably won't do it. They'll tell you, \"We don't\nhave that much cash on hand. We don't this, we don't that.\" They have certain banks that do that. So they told me where one\nof those was, I went there, I had a check for like 29,000 that had been cut on a\nclosing for Michael Shanahan. Remember I refinanced Michael Shanahan's. And then I've got a check\nfor 29,000 that was issued to Scott Cugno. So I'm sitting in the bank, I go in there and I say,\nI need to cash this. And she says, \"You're gonna\nhave talk to the manager.\" I go, \"Okay.\" She says,\n\"Go sit down over there.\" I go sit down in the little glass cubicle. He comes over and he says, \"I see you're trying to cash this check.\" And I was like, \"Right,\" he goes, \"Why don't you just\ndeposit in your own bank?\" And I went, \"My bank account,\nmy bank is a credit union or something, and it's in like Florida. Like, they'll hold this\nthing for like two weeks. Like, I need the money now I\nhave people I need to pay.\" He is like, \"Well, I'm not sure.\" And I was like, \"Well, it's fine. It's a cashier's check. Like it's good.\" \"And he goes, \"No, it's good. It's good.\" I said, \"You have the money.\" And he is like, \"Yeah, we have the money.\" He said, \"It's just odd. Hold on.\" He goes back in the back and he comes back and he says, \"Where'd you get the check?\" Cashier's check. I said,\n\"It was a cashier's check. It was drawn off of a closing\nfor somebody's property that I, we're doing\nthe company I work for, we are putting on an addition on,.\" \"Okay, that makes sense.\" Comes back, goes, \"Well,\nwhy do you need cash?\" And I was like, \"I'm cashing guys' checks that work for the company. Like there's a lot of these\nguys that are like Mexican guys. They give them a check, they\ngo to a check cashing company or they get charged five, 10%. So I cashed him, I'm like,\nI don't under like, what, the check's good, right?\" Like my, and he's like, \"Yeah, we're just trying to verify some stuff.\" And he went, \"Yeah, hold\non.\" And he leaves again. And I remember my cell phone rang and I pick up the phone, it's Becky, said, \"What are you doing?\nWhat's taking so long?\" I go, \"Ah, the guy's being a jerk. He doesn't wanna gimme the money.\" Oh, she's like, \"Oh my\nGod, get outta the bank. Get outta the bank.\" And I went, \"I can't get outta the bank. The guy's got my ID, he's\ngot my credit card, my ID and the check for 29,000. Like, he's gonna call the police\nif I just jump up and run.\" And I go, \"Don't call me again. I'll let you know. It'll be fine.\" Hang out the phone. She calls back, same conversation. \"I'm bouncing off the walls. I'm like, I'm going crazy.\"\n(Matt imitates yelling) Like, \"It'll be fine.\" Hang up the phone. He comes back out and he\ngoes, he said, I said, \"Hey,\" I said, \"What's taking so long?\" And he goes, \"We're trying to get in touch with Michael Shanahan\nto verify the check.\" That was not good for me. Like I'm thinking,\nright, right, okay, okay. And he walks away, the\nphone rings, it's Becky, \"What's going on?\" I go, \"They're trying to get\nahold of Michael Shanahan.\" She goes, \"Oh my God! Oh my God!\" And I'm like, \"Oh my God. And I would remember thinking, I shouldn't have left her the keys. There's a good chance I run\noutta this place and she does, she's not there.\n- But by the way, when you're sitting there, you're who? Scott? You're Scott.\n- I'm Scott Cugno. - And then he's calling Michael Shanahan. - Right, they're saying\nthey're trying to get in touch with Michael Shanahan. So then the phone rings,\nmy cell rings again, and I look, and it's not Becky's. - Yeah.\n- Not Becky. So I pick up the phone, I go, \"Hello?\" And she says, \"Hi, this\nis Kim from SunTrust Bank, is this Michael Shanahan?\" So I'm like, \"Yes, it\nis Michael Shanahan.\" And she says, \"There's a guy here, he's trying to cash a check. It's very large. Could\nyou verify the payee?\" And I go, \"Sure, it's Scott Cugno. He's trying,\" I said, \"I\nbelieve the amount's $29,000.\" And she goes, \"That's\nright. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\" I said, \"Okay,\" I said, \"Hey, by the way, how'd you get my number?\nThis is my cell number.\" And she's like, \"Oh, I'm sorry. We called the title company and the title company gave\nus your phone number.\" Well, I closed those\nloans. That's my cell. That's why if they looked in\nany other way, I would've, they could've gotten in touch\nwith a real Michael Shanahan. So I was like, \"Oh,\nokay.\" Hang up the phone. - You're sitting, you answered\nthe phone from the bank while sitting in the bank. - As Scott.\n- As Michael Shan- - As Scott Cugno.\n- As Scott pretending to be Michael-\n- So I just, right. So I just verified the check myself. - As Matthew pretending to be Scott that's pretending to be Michael. - Right.\n- Yeah. - So I wait there, terrified still. They come out about two minutes later, the manager comes out, plus a woman, I'm assuming maybe that was Kim. She never said anything. And she walks out and she says, and he counts out the money twice. 29,000. 29,000. And I stand up and I mean just like, I'm remember like shoving\nthe money in my pockets. Like I'm trying to get outta\nthere so quick, I'm like, \"Hey,\" I'm like, \"Okay, cool.\" Like, I'm thinking this\nwhole thing's is, you know, feels bad and I'm getting\nup and I'm, so, I'm starting to walk outta the bank. And he goes, he said,\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Cugno?\" And I said, \"Yes, sir.\" I turned around and he goes, \"I'd like you to know,\nI'd like you to know that I feel very apprehensive\nabout this transaction.\" And I go, \"Really? What is it exactly?\" And he goes, \"I can't\nput my finger on it.\" And I go, \"It'll come to you.\" And I turn around and I just\nbolt right out of there. And so keep in mind, a week or so later, the Secret Service shows up. \"Did you cash a check for $29,000?\" So what's so funny is like, that was one of the last checks we cashed. So we ended up with like 400,000. - Was there a connection between the Secret Service and this guy? - No, the-\n- The apprehension?"

And they've put out a\nfugitive warrant for me, which is how the US Marshals got involved. - So this US Marshals\ntrack down fugitives. - Yes. Federal fugitives, they track down. - But everybody's after\nyou, you're on every list. - Right, I'm on the FBI's Most Wanted list.\n- Most wanted. - At that point the Secret\nService got involved once I leave Atlanta. So when Becky and I pack up our bags and we leave Atlanta, the\nSecret Service got involved because of identity theft, you know, banking, identity theft. The Secret Service doesn't\njust do counterfeiting and protect the president. They also protect the\nfinancial infrastructure of the United States. And they especially have jurisdiction when identity theft is involved. - So I identity theft\nplus bank fraud there. That's when they arrest.\n- They move, yeah. That's it. That's their territory. So they don't.\n- And the US Marshals are just fugitives.\n- US Marshals, just fugitives. They don't do any investigation. - They're all kind of work. Okay. But they're all kind of working together. - Yeah, they, yeah. The, you know, like the\nUS Marshals are like, let's say an arm of all of the various law enforcement agencies, federal agencies, not the states. The states have their own\nfugitive task forces or fugitive. - So when you leave Atlanta, basically everybody's after you. - Everybody's after me. - Did you know this at that\ntime or did you sense it or? - No, I mean, now, you know, every day you're looking up, you're just looking\nyour name up every day. Like, I'm not, because I'm\njust trying to get a bunch of money and just blend in, right? Things were not as interconnected at that time as they are now. But they're starting\nto get interconnected. But of course, I have no idea how much. I barely go on the internet\nfor anything, you know, dating, that's the only thing that\nthe internet, you know, I'd never been on Facebook. At this point Facebook isn't\neven up, isn't even out yet. This is 2006. - Still, were you trying to stay low? - Yeah, I am because\nI'm not a flashy person. Like I'm not driving, you\nknow, like I didn't go out and buy a red Lamborghini,\nyou know, I'm driving, I'm driving 40, $50,000 cars. You know, I've had some\nsports cars, 70, 80, you know, maybe that's 150,000 sports car now. But it's still not flashy. It's not like it's bright red or yellow. I mean, these are, it's always something, you know, nondescript. And I'm living in areas that\nthese cars are everywhere,"

And in between this period\nof time we go to Las Vegas and I, when we go to\nLas, we go to Las Vegas to drop off a bunch of money\nto Becky's son's father who's taking care of her son. We drop off some money there. We go and we start and while we're there, it's like, hey, there's homeless people here. So we-\n(Matt laughs) - So you're always, you.\n- Usually I don't feel bad telling these stories. You make me feel bad.\n- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My judgment is showing. No, but you have to be\ncollecting identities, I guess, to be constantly creating new identities. - So I got my survey forms. So I go and I, you know, we go out and we're taking, I'm taking surveys and I end up going up to\nthis guy who's like two or three guys that are\nstanding on like a bench or sitting on next to\na bench or something. And I see him and I walk up\nand the guy, one guy gets up and he comes over and he is like, \"Hey, what do you need?\" And I went, \"I'm taking\nsurveys for the Salvation Army to determine where we place\nour next homeless facility.\" And the guy goes, \"Oh,\nI'm not interested.\" And they always said that. And I said, \"It pays 20\nbucks cash right now. It'll take you five minutes.\" And they're like, \"What?\nYou $20 cash right now? I was like, \"Yeah,\" I show them the cash. And they go, \"Okay, yeah,\nyeah. What do you need?\" Name, date of birth,\nSocial Security number. So when I get to criminal record, the guy, he says, \"Criminal record?\" He's like, \"Yeah, I've been arrested.\" He goes, \"I've been arrested like three, four times for,\" he\nsaid, \"For prostitution.\" He said, \"But they're like misdemeanors.\" And I went, \"Okay.\" And it was like, okay, prostitution, to me, women get charged\nwith prostitution, you know? Men get charged with solicitation. I went, \"Prostitution?\" And he goes and he went,\nhe said, \"Yeah, yeah.\" He said, \"I offered to blow an\nundercover cop for 20 bucks.\" He said, \"That's what I\nthought you were coming out here for.\" And I was like, and I\nwas like, \"No, no, bro.\" I said, \"Okay.\" And he's like, \"Yeah.\" He said, you know, he goes, I mean, he said, \"I\nmean, a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do, you know?\" And he made some comment or something. I was like, \"Okay.\"\n- Yeah. - So I jot down the\nrest of it, we're good. I give him 20 bucks, I\nget in my car, I leave. We get back to North Carolina. I order all of his documents.\nHis name was Gary Sullivan. I then go to South Carolina. When I go to South Carolina, I get a real estate agent. We drive around for a day. We look at like five or six houses. I put five owner financing contracts\non five different houses. So I get him, he writes up\nfive contracts, all of them. I'm asking for owner\nfinancing, I'll put down 10%. I want owner financing. Two of them end up coming back and saying, \"Yes, we'll do it.\" I have two closings. One of them is a house\nthat's worth like 225,000. I put down 25 grand.\nAnother one's 110,000. I put down 11,000. So\nI buy these two houses. I then satisfy the loans\non both the houses. Everything seems like it's going okay. Although Becky's a lunatic at this point. She's had so many, she\nwon't take her medication. She's had so many outbursts that, and we've had, by this time\nwe've had plastic surgery. Like she's gotten plastic\nsurgery, she's gotten a boob job, she's gotten liposuction,\nI mean, all kinds of stuff. So-\n- Look way different? Like appearance changes or? - Thinner, better looking, you know, just tightened everything up, I guess. You know, she was in her, she'd had a kid, and she was 30, 33, 34. I don't know how old she was. 20, 32, 33. I don't know, roughly my age. So yeah, I thought she looked, you know, she lost like 15 pounds. Like she was not 'cause of the surgery, but just in general, we're\nnot, we're just working out. We're going mountain climbing. We're, you know, riding\nbikes, we're doing, you know, there's fraud's not a full-time job. So, you know, we have plenty of time. So we're goofing off. And, but she's also a lunatic. You know, she's getting the cops called, she's able to go out and\nshe's able to stay stoned 24 hours a day. She's going out with friends, drinking. I never leave the house. You know, even to this day, I really barely ever leave the house. I'm very much a homebody kind of person. So like the idea that I'm able to make my living doing YouTube and I'd never have to leave my house. I love that. I don't ever go anywhere except\nfor the gym and back home. That's it. So what happens is, I've actually moved her\nout of my apartment. Like I had an apartment\ndowntown, 30 story building. I actually moved her\ninto another apartment. She's that much of a lunatic. We can't even be in the same place. Multiple times I've tried to leave her, she's called me up and\nbegged me to come back. It's horrible. So I end\nup buying a couple houses in Columbia, South Carolina. I satisfy the loans on the houses. I've got an ID, not a driver's license, but an ID in the name\nof Gary Lee Sullivan. And I refinanced, or I\nrefinanced those houses. 'cause keep in mind there\nwas owner financing, but they also had mortgages. So there's something called\na wraparound mortgage. So these guys did wraparound mortgages. So let's say you buy a\nhouse for 200, $250,000 and the bank lends you 200,000. And then you own or\nfinance the house to me. So we do a, I give you 50 grand down, but I'm not able to get\na loan from the bank to pay off your mortgage. So what we do is you do\na wraparound mortgage. So I'll pay you your mortgage\nand you pay the bank. So there is a second\nmortgage on the property, but it's called a wrap, it's wrapped around your first. - That's legal? - Yeah. So I wouldn't lie to you. So it's, so there's, these\nhave wraparound mortgages. So-\n- You're always selling and you're good at it. - So I go, I satisfy the\nloans, the owner finance loans, the wraparound mortgages, and I satisfy the loans\ntheir, the original loans that these people took out\non their own mortgages. One of them, by the way, I\nsat, you know, you have to sign as the president of the bank, right? - Yeah.\n- So I sign it as C. Montgomery Burns, which is the aging tycoon, the\nguy that owns a power plant in \"The Simpsons,\" TV show. - Yeah.\n- So I sign that and I notarize it, which\nI thought was cute. I actually wanted to sign all\nof them cartoon characters. And Becky was screaming her head off and wouldn't let me do it, right? Like I wanted to do all\n\"The Simpsons,\" right? But she wouldn't let me do it. She's screaming and hollering. So I ended up, you know,\nseeing, nobody knows who C. Montgomery Burns is. So I sign it, notarize it,\nall of those are satisfied. I then go to the multiple banks and I refinance, start refinancing all these properties multiple times. So I'm applying for these loans and I'm getting the loans and I'm closing. So I've got like five or\nsix loans on this one house. So house is like 225,000, I think it was like 230, whatever. I borrow like four or\nfive loans on that house. So I borrow like\n$190,000, like five times. So I've got like $800,000. And then I borrow another three or 400,000 on the other house. The one, the smaller one, right? So it ends up being like $1.3 million. It's actually like 1.5 million. It was more, but what\nhappened with that was, so keep in mind, you can only open up so many bank accounts in your name. You can go to Bank of\nAmerica, they'll open one. Then you go to SunTrust, they'll open one. They're gonna ask, they\nmight even ask you, \"Did you open another bank account today?\" 'Cause every time you do\nit, there's an inquiry into something called\nCheck Systems or AccuCheck. And so then they go, so\nthen by the time you go to the third bank, they'll say, \"Listen, something's not right. You've got multiple inquiries.\" You know, if you go to\nwhatever Mercantile Bank, there might be, they might go,\n\"Okay, we're gonna open one,\" they're gonna need an explanation. But you're not, you're not\nopening more than three. By the third one, they're gonna be like, \"Absolutely not, something's wrong.\" So, you know, I've got\nmultiple identities, but I can only open up so many banks. The other problem is that these checks, they'll only give you\nso much money on a refi. Usually after 100,000, they\nonly wanna let you walk away with let's say $100,000. So one of the things I did\nwas I would typically record another mortgage and have\nthem pay that mortgage off. So I had to open, I opened\na corporation to do that so I could then turn around and go open corporate bank accounts, 'cause now it's not\ngoing off my information, it's going off the corporation so I can open up multiple\ncorporate bank accounts. - [Lex] Well, these\ncorporations are fake or real? - No, no, I went to a real\ncorporate bank attorney to corporate attorney\nand had him open them. I gave him whatever. I gave\nhim like $1,500, $2,000. And he opened up a corporation\nfor me, Gary Sullivan. And I then turned around and I went and opened up multiple bank accounts in that corporation's name. - How are you keeping track of all this? 'Cause it.\n- This is, I don't need this. - So I-\n- It's in your head or do you have good organization? - No, no, oh no, no, I have, every single identity has its own file with, you know, plastic inlays,\nsleeves for their passports. - [Lex] Oh, it's nice in order. - Yeah, it's super organized.\n- You open this. I'm Gary now.\n- Right. That's exactly what it is. Like, you kind of go over,\nboom, boom, boom, boom. You sit in your car for a minute, you put it down, you walk in. Well, what happens is it\nwent up to like 1.5 million and I'm pulling money outta the bank. And then one day I got a phone call on Gary Sullivan's cell phone. The guy, it's a lawyer. They call up, he says, \"Hey, I'm lawyer with Washington Mutual. We have an issue.\" I said, \"What's that?\" He says, \"We got a phone\ncall from the title company,\" one of the title companies that I was attempting to refinance one of the pieces of\nproperty with noticed that I, they had been sent, they'd been\nsent a document that showed that I had purchased the property. And I said, I purchased it cash and the documents that\nI purchased it cash. And they got that and there was actually a\nmortgage on the property. And so somehow or\nanother, they connected it and they called Washington Mutual and they said, \"Look, there's\nan issue, there's a fraud. We have a fraudulent document here.\" And he was like, he said,\n\"So we went and we looked and it turns out that\nwe pulled public records and that there is a\nmortgage in front of us, several mortgages in front of us. So there's like three or four\nmortgages in front of me, Washington Mutual, you owe us.\" And it wasn't that much,\nit was like a hundred, it was like a hundred grand, right? Like 95 or a hundred. And I said, \"Okay.\" And he said, \"So there's an issue here. You've got a few mortgages in front of us and we're supposed to be a first mortgage and we're not supposed to be\ntwo mortgages behind or three.\" And I was like, \"Okay, sounds\nlike a, sounds like an error. Not a big deal. Have you\ncontacted law enforcement?\" He said, \"No, I haven't. I was hoping we could\nrectify this some other way.\" I said, \"You know what? I think we can. I'm gonna have my lawyer call you back. I'm gonna go to his place right now. Give me about two hours.\" No problem, I immediately\nrun, jump in my car, head towards South Carolina,\ncall my corporate lawyer, tell him, \"Look, I need to talk to you. Here's what's going on.\" I explain it to him. He doesn't really understand. He says, \"This sounds pretty complicated. I have a, my law partner is\na criminal defense attorney. I'm gonna have, I'm gonna set up a meeting right now with all of us.\" Okay, I get there 45 minutes\nlater, I walk in the door, I sit down, he says, \"What happened?\" I said, \"Oh,\" they said, you know, \"Gary, this doesn't sound right. What's, what do you, what happened?\" I said, \"Okay, so listen,\nbought this house. I bought it cash. I then refinanced it.\" I didn't buy it cash, but I\ntold them, \"I bought it cash. I refinanced it like four or five times within a day or two of each other.\" And they were like, \"How\nis that even possible?\" I was like, \"Well, I went to\ndifferent title companies\" and I explained how I do it. I said, \"Washington Mutual just found out that they're in like second\nposition or third position,\" or I said, \"But they're probably, they may be in fourth position. You know, they mail these\nthings in so you never know.\" And he was like, \"Oh my God. He's like, that's what do you want to do?\" I said, \"I want you to contact them and agree for them to not\ncontact the authorities provided I pay them off.\" He goes, \"Do you have the money?\" I said, \"I do have the money. I can go get the money right now.\" He calls the lawyer, this\nis back when faxes, right? So they fax some documents back and forth. They make, they do a couple\nemails back and forth and they have a conversation. I remember the lawyer started arguing 'cause he wanted to charge\nme like yield spread and fees and stuff. And I was like, \"What\nare you talking about? Like, I'll pay it.\" Like, so it ends up being\na little over 100,000. And I'm like, \"That's it.\"\nSo he is like, \"Okay.\" And so he says, \"Okay, that sounds good.\" And so he said, \"Okay, all you have to\ndo is go get the check.\" And he said, \"Bring it to\na Washington Mutual branch. Tell them to call,\" I said, \"I'm not going in a\nWashington Mutual branch, bro. I'll bring you the check.\" So he calls him back, \"He's not\ndoing that, man, he's done.\" \"Okay, I'm not, I'll bring it here. You guys take care, \"he said, no problem.\" Okay, hang up the phone. And he turns to me and he says, \"Okay, well we have a problem.\" He said, \"We still have the problem of these other mortgages.\" And I went, \"Right.\" And he goes, \"Okay, well.\" I said, \"They don't know anything.\" He said, \"I know, but Gary.\" He said, \"What if they find out?\" I said, 'They find out that they're like in second and third and fourth by place?' He's like, \"Right.\" I\nsaid, \"I leave town.\" And he went, so they both laugh. They go, \"Gary, you can't just leave town. They have a copy of your driver's license. They have your Social Security number, they have your birth certificate.\" He said, he goes, \"They'll\nfind you. It's the FBI.\" And I go, \"You're assuming\nI'm Gary Sullivan.\" - Wow. You tell them.\n- And he, they, listen, they looked at me and they went, and I remember he said, he goes, \"We'll cross that bridge\nwhen we get to it.\" And I said, \"Right, my\nimmediate problem is getting rid of these people.\" And he goes, \"Right, right.\" So I go get the check, bring\nit back, give it to them. Never called the FBI. - I can't believe you got away\nwith the Washington Mutual. - Oh no, this is-\n- I mean, these are all really close calls it seems like. - You No, this is the close call. I have two more close calls that my hands sweat thinking about it. I walk in, I walk into Wachovia. I just opened this account two months ago, so it's a new account. So whenever I would go\nin there and I'd say, \"Hey, I need a $7,000,\n$6,000,\" anything over $3,000, they had to call to get permission, right? Like authorization. So she's like, \"Okay, I gotta go call.\" I said, \"No problem.\" So the girl walks in the back,\nI'm sitting there waiting. All of a sudden a massive person reaches over my hand and grabs my wrist and somebody grabs it from the other one and they pull my hands behind my back. These are two of possibly the largest law enforcement officers I've\never seen in my entire life. I mean, they're massive. And they handcuff me and they say, \"You are Mr. Sullivan, you're being detained. We're taking you into custody and, you know, putting, you, we're holding you until\na detective gets here.\" - Who are these guys? Is this US Marshalls or\nis this cops or what? - [Matt] These are sheriff's deputies. - Sheriff's deputies. - And as they walk me in-\n- Sullivan, Gary Sullivan. - Right, as they walk me in the back, they're calling me Mr. Sullivan. - Right.\n- They sit me down and by now I am, you know, the Secret service are looking for me. They're calling me. Well, they were calling\nus John and Jane Doe. But now they figured out who we were. And so now I'm on the secret\nservice's Most Wanted list. I'm not like number one at that, right? Like I probably was, but\nwe just found out I was on, like, on that list. So it's getting bad. So they sent me down and I'm waiting and I remember thinking that\nthe FBI was coming, you know, I don't really know at that point, I couldn't tell you the\ndifference between everybody. And then five minutes go by and, you know, I'm sitting\nthere going, \"What is going on? Do you guys have any idea what's going?\" \"They're like, we don't\nknow. We're just grunts. We just do what we're told.\" So suddenly this guy walks in, he's probably in his early 30s maybe, he walks in, gray suit. I think he looks like he's FBI. He says, \"Hey, I'm a detective with the,\" I wanna say Richland\nCounty, you know, whatever, sheriff's department or\npolice department, whatever. And I was like, \"Oh, okay.\" And he says, \"Yeah, listen,\nwe've got an issue.\" Wachovia wants this. They\nwant us to arrest you.\" He said that, \"They're saying that you've got three\nmortgages on your house.\" And I go, \"Is that illegal?\" And he looked at me and he went, \"You know, to be honest, I don't know.\" And I distinctly remember\nthinking, I'm walking outta here. All I have to do is convince this guy, I haven't done anything wrong. He's already said he doesn't know. So he gets on the phone with the head of Wachovia's\nfraud department, and he's telling, saying, \"This guy is running what's\ncalled a shotgunning scam,\" which is absolutely right. And so-\n- What is a shotgun? - It's where you're you\nclose on so many loans simultaneously, they can't catch it. Anyway, they start going back and forth and he's on the phone and he's like, \"Why did you close three loans?\" And I said, \"I,\" you know, \"Why are you pulling,\" I\nsaid, \"It's not illegal. I have a first mortgage,\na second mortgage, and a home equity line of\ncredit, that's perfectly legal.\" And he goes, and you can hear the guy. \"Yeah, it's not, they're\nall first mortgages.\" And I said, \"I read every\none of those documents. Not one of them said they\nwere first mortgages.\" And they don't, first mortgages don't say\nthey're first mortgages. It's the placement of the mortgage, placement of the lien that\ndetermines is their first, second or third. So it's possible that I wouldn't\nhave known it certainly, that I could have read those\ndocuments and not known. And he's like, \"That's not true.\" And he's screaming. And so I go, \"Yeah, listen,\" and he said, \"Well, you're taking out all cash. Why are you taking all cash?\" I said, \"Well, I mean, I don't know if this, this sounds,\" I said, \"I don't know if\nthis might be illegal. I said, I don't know.\" I said, \"I mean, I work\nfor a labor company, Labor on Demand.\" I pull out my business\ncard, \"You can call.\" So I'm like, \"I work for Labor on Demand. And I said, \"We hire a lot of guys that, like, they don't have bank accounts. So the company pays them. And then I'll usually, I'll pull out money and I'll cash their checks because they get charged like 10% of these check cashing companies. And I feel bad. I know\nthe checks are good. So I just deposit them. I mean, I don't think that, but I don't know if that's illegal. I don't think that's illegal. Like if,\" and he is like,\n\"No, no, that's fine. That's a decent thing to\ndo, it's not, that's fine.\" I'm like, \"Oh, okay.\" So he's talking to the guy and you know, Wachovia is screaming out, hollering, he says, \"He's doing that,\" you know, he's going back\nand forth, back and forth. So we're going back and forth, back, and I'm just derailing\neverything this guy says. And at one point he says, he's screaming, \"He's committing fraud, we want him arrested.\" And he's like, \"I don't know\nwhat to charge him with.\" And he's like, you know, he's saying, these aren't, you know,\n\"How did you, you know, how did you?\" He's like, \"Hey, look, how\ndid you even do this? What?\" I go, \"Look, I didn't do this.\" I said, \"I came to Wachovia,\nI met with a loan officer. I said, 'I need a first mortgage, I need to pull out like $100,000. I wanna start buying houses.'\" He goes, \"That's right, you own another house\nhere too, don't you?\" I said, \"I do.\" I said, \"We're putting a new roof on it. We're gonna build an addition.\nWe're putting in a pool. I'm buying one right down\nthe street from that one.\" I said, \"So I'm obviously,\nI'm pulling out money.\" I said, \"So I told them I need $100,000.\" They said, \"That's fine, we can,\" they said they could\nonly get me $100,000 out for something about Fannie\nMae guidelines, which is true. And I said, so then she\nsaid, \"I had, I can get you, I can send you to a friend\nof mine who's a loan officer. She can get you a second\nmortgage,\" which she did. I said, then I told her she\ncould only get me 100,000 or so, 190,000 and the other. And she said, \"You\nshould get an equity line of credit if you're gonna\nbe doing like, you know, renovating properties.\" So she sent me to somebody and they got me an equity line of credit. I said, \"You know, I\nhaven't committed fraud.\" I said, \"I wouldn't\nknow how to commit fraud if you told me.\" I said, \"What sounds more reasonable? A guy that works for a labor company ripped off a bunch of banks for over half a million dollars,\" I said, \"Or some loan\nofficers got together and did something illegal?\" I said, \"There's a problem at the bank.\" And he says, \"I think you've\ngot a problem at the bank.\" And this guy goes nuts. And while he's screaming, \"He needs to be arrested, this is fraud. My loan officers have not\ndone anything illegal. They wouldn't do that.\" He says, \"Look at his ID, his ID is fake. His ID starts with 000.\" South Carolina IDs start with 000. This guy's in California. He has no idea. So when he says that, the detective looks at my ID and he goes, \"Listen,\" he said, \"This is a real ID. I ran this guy through NCIC.\" He said, \"This is Gary Sullivan.\" And I looked at him, I go,\n\"Now I'm not Gary Sullivan? I go, \"Come on bro.\nWhat are we doing here?\" And he goes, \"I know Gary, I know.\" And he says, \"I'm gonna take him downtown. I'm going to talk to\nmy whatever lieutenant, whoever captain, and I'm\ngonna fill out a police report and I'll let you know.\" And he hangs up. - Yeah.\n- I get up, they've taken the\nhandcuffs off, I stand up. As we're walking out with the detectives, as we're all kind of walking out, he goes, \"Hey, you have an ID, do you\nhave a driver's license?\" And I went, \"I do, but\nit's in like Nevada.\" And he goes, \"Oh, that's right.\" He goes, \"You're from Vegas.\" And he looks at the two deputies\nand they all kind of grin. And I think he ran me through NCIC, which means he ran a\nstatewide criminal database, which means he thinks I've\nbeen arrested three times for prostitution in Vegas. \"Ah, right.\" Listen, I'm humiliated. I was just like, and the grin told me, and I was just like, oh man. And so one of the cops goes, \"Here, gimme the ID,\"\ntakes the ID, he goes, \"I'll check and see,\" 'cause I have to follow\nhim back in my car. So he goes, and by the way, my car is in the name Michael Eckert. So Michael Eckert, he\ndoesn't have a photograph of Michael Eckert.\n- Right. - Because you can't pull up\nphotographs from other states. So he doesn't have a photograph, but he knows that's not my car. And he asked me, whose\ncar are you driving? I said, oh, \"That's my\nboss, Michael Eckert.\" And I said that, \"That's my boss.\" And he goes, \"Oh, Michael Eckert?\" I said, \"Yeah, exactly.\" And he's like, and I'm like, oh my God. So I'm thinking he knows Michael Eckert, knows it's registered in North\nCarolina, knows the address, which is where I was currently living. That's a problem. So the police officer, or the, sorry, deputy grabs\nthe ID, walks outside, comes back, I have no idea if this homeless guy has a\ndriver's license in Nevada. I don't know. He had nothing on him. He comes back and he goes,\n\"Does he have a valid license?\" He goes, \"Yeah, it's valid.\" And he hands it to him,\nor he hands me the ID. And he says, he said,\nhe goes, \"It's valid.\" And he looked at me, he\ngoes, \"Yeah, well,\" he said,, \"It says he's like, he\nsays he's five foot 11.\" Like it was like 510, 511. And I'm clearly not 510 or 511. And they all look at me and I go, \"Fellas, with a good pair\nof shoes,\" like that. And they all go,\n(Matt imitates laughing) \"Follow us, Gary.\"\n- Yeah. - I follow them back\nto the police station. Becky is calling me on the\nphone, screaming her head off. Now, I'd always told Becky,\nif I ever get arrested, immediately go get me a lawyer. The lawyer will be able\nto get me out on bond, 'cause I'll be arrested\nfor something stupid. I said, \"It'll be something\nlike trying to cash a check,\" you know, a fake check or a, you know, use of somebody,\nsaid, \"It won't be the, all my IDs are real, so\nit won't be for a fake ID. So my ID won't be in question.\" And most, most police departments and sheriffs at that time did not run your\nfingerprints through AFIS. So they didn't, 'cause\nthey charged them for that. So they don't, they don't typically do it unless your identity is in question. Mine wouldn't be, I have\na valid driver's license or a valid ID in that state. So I go back, she's screaming, she's like, \"Oh my God, you don't understand. I just checked the internet, the website. You are number one on the Secret Services Most Wanted list.\" And I was like, \"I got\nbigger problems right now. They just held me in the bank. I'm following them right now.\"\n- Like right now. - And she was like, \"Get on the interstate. Go, go.\" \"I cannot go, the\ndetective's in front of me. The cops are behind me. They're escorting me\nto the police, listen.\" She's like, Oh my God. Run, run.\" I go, \"Look, I'm not a NASCAR\ndriver, like I'm driving. It's a sports car, but it's\nnot gonna outrun a radio or a helicopter.\" Like, I'm not, that's not gonna happen. I know it looks, it seems nice. I'm not that guy.\" So I was like, I can't, I said,\n\"Look, you don't understand. I was in handcuffs 30 minutes ago. I just talked my way out of\nthem. I'm gonna get outta this.\" And I said, \"The worst that happens is I'll be arrested as Gary Sullivan. You can get me a plea. You\ncan get me an attorney. He can get me out.\" And she goes, \"I'm not\ngetting you an attorney. I'm not getting you out on bond.\" - Oh no, Becky.\n- \"I'm not risking everything I've got for you.\" Because she has all the money. We've got seven, $800,000 at this point. So, oh, and by the way, she's not even in North\nCarolina at this point. She's relocated to Houston, Texas. Because when this scam broke, fell apart, we were gonna move to Texas. So, wait, we were\nalready moving there. So. - But by the way, just a small tangent, where do you store money\nin situations like this that, like, when you talk about 800,000, do you have to keep moving accounts to make sure it's not accessible by FBI?\n- There's about, well, there's about six\nor 700,000 in accounts. But keep in mind, I'm\ngetting that out in cash. Like there's no Bitcoin, there's no, none of that stuff exists. So my, you know, I probably\nshould have bought diamonds or bought gold or bought like,\nI don't know any of that. All I could think of is\ngo in slowly, be patient, don't drain the accounts,\nyou know, fluctuate them. Like I was writing,\ngetting cashier's checks from one account to another. So the balances were doing this, you know, they weren't just going, (Matt imitates deflating) they were doing this, and then one day, boom, they're gone.\n- Okay, got it. - So.\n- Got it. - So we got out, like whatever, we've gotten out like six or 700,000. There's still like six\nor 700,000 in the bank. But I'm not going back. I'm done. I actually, to be honest\nwith you, so well, look, I go in, so I go into the police station and well, first she says, \"If you go in the police\nstation, I'm done. If you get arrested, you're done.\" I said, \"Well, then I\nbetter not get arrested.\" I hang up the phone, the\ncop's standing behind my car. I get out, I go in the\npolice station, I walk in, I fill out the police report. He tells me ,\"I gotta talk\nto my captain real quick. Can you wait?\" He couldn't\nleave me in his cubicle. He goes, \"Can you wait in the hallway? I can't leave you in the cubicle.\" I said, \"No, no problem.\" So I go and I wait in the hallway. In the hallway are a whole wall full of on the corkboard wanted posters. Black and white. Black and white. Like, you know, car thief,\nyou know, rapist, murderer, secret Services most wanted. And I'm on the, on on\nmy faces right there. I'm like, holy Jesus. And you know, everything\nin me told me, \"Run bro. Just fucking haul ass\nright now, right now. Just go, your luck's run out.\" Not that I even thought he\nwas, there were so many, I didn't think he was gonna see it. But it just, everything\nin me just said run. The problem is if you've ever\nbeen a into a police station, you're not getting out of it. Do you understand that?\n- There's a lot of cops around.\n- No, well, not just that, but they buzz you in. - Yeah.\n- You get in the elevator, you have to punch in a code.\n- Right? - You have to punch in a code to get back out of the elevator. You have to punch in a code\nto get into the next door. There's like a, I mean, it's impossible. Like I'm never, I'm not\ngonna get in the elevator. So guy comes back up to the,\ncop comes back up, he said, \"Hey, Gary, appreciate it. No problem. My captain said, we're good. We're gonna wait for a phone\ncall from the,\" no wait. \"The district attorney called already. They're looking into it. I'm\ngonna go ahead and let you go.\" I go downstairs, he\nwalks me out to my car. He said, \"Look, do me a favor.\" He is like, \"We do have\nsome serious questions at this point, like the\ndistrict attorney says, there's some, something's up,\" he said. And I said, \"Not with me.\" And he said, \"Well, just do me a favor.\" He goes, \"Don't leave town.\" I said, \"Bro, I own two houses here. I'm not going anywhere.\" I said, \"I'm telling you right now. I said, \"Wachovia, they fucked up.\" And he is like, \"I believe\nyou. I believe you.\" He said, well, he said, whatever. He is like, \"I hope that you're right. I'm sure you're right.\" Okay, so I get in my car, I leave, I go to two more banks,\npull out more money. But at one point I go into a bank and like two of the\ncashiers practically slam into each other, trying\nto get to the phone. And I could tell something's up. Like, oh, no, no, no, no. Something's up. So I back, I get in my car, back out. One of them even kind of runs out and looks at the tag number, you know. So I drive, I get on the interstate. I go, I, you know, Becky,\nof course, she's, you know. \"I'm sorry, I love you. I would've never done\nthat. I was just scared.\" I understand. I go-\n- Becky sounds like a handful. - Oh my God, bro. So I go all\nthe way back to Charlotte."

      "text": "I pack up my apartment. I drive all the way to Houston with my entire apartment packed\nup, by the way, in a U-Haul. Like the next day, the\nnext morning we pack. She's got people there\npacking it up, movers. We pack it up. I drive the\nU-Haul all the way to Houston. Takes a couple days. I unload it into, we\nhave some guys unload it into a storage unit. 'cause I'm gonna stay with Becky until I find my own apartment. As we're driving around the\nneighborhood, super nice. She's living in like, whatever,\nlike on like that 20th floor or something of some huge\nhigh rise, great apartment. We drive by and I go, \"Oh, stop the car,\" and I go, \"I want to get out.\" It is one of those cone\nthings where there's flyers for the house, for a house. I jump out and I get the flyer, and she's like, \"What are you doing?\" I go, oh, \"I just want, you know, I just look at looking at the flyer and she says, \"I don't\nwanna do a scam here. I wanna live here. This place\nis nice. I love it here.\" And I went, \"Right, I understand.\" I said, \"I'm not gonna,\" I said, \"No, but I have to find an apartment.\" And she goes, \"Oh, you just,\nI'm just so disgusting. You can't stand to spend\neven a couple weeks with me. You just,\" and she goes just ballistic. She's screaming at the top of her lungs. And I know she's gonna get me caught. She's never gonna get me out, right? She's already told me that. So we go back to the\napartment, we go upstairs. I was so scared of this chick, bro. I was so scared, I remember I\nwas going up in the elevator and this girl gets on\nthis clearly a stripper. I mean, drop dead, just but\nwearing stripper clothes. - Yeah.\n- And I'm staring like, and as soon she got on, Becky\ngave me that, with the face. And I'm like, this, I'm\nlike staring in the corner and never look at the girl. And I remember we get off the elevator. (Matt imitates elevator bell dinging) It opens, I bolt off\nit, Becky bolts office, off the elevator. And I remember she squeals. \"I bet you'd just love\nto fuck that tramp.\" And the girl, as the elevator\ndoors are closing, she goes, \"Hey!\"\n(Matt laughs) I thought that was funny. So I go to the apartment. We have a screaming match, kind of, tell her I wanna split up the money. She tells me she's not gonna\ngimme, split the money. - Why?\n- Because she said, \"You can go somewhere\nelse and do this again. You'll have a million\ndollars in six months. You know, I have to live off this money. - [Lex] Did she threaten you? - Oh, she threatened\nthe, it was funny too, 'cause the conversation back and forth, I remember saying, \"No, I want half.\" And she goes, and she said,\n\"I'll give you $10,000.\" I said, \"You're outta your mind.\" I said, \"I'm telling\nright now, you come up with something reasonable,\nI'll take all of it.\" And she said, what did she say? I said, \"I'll take all of it.\" She goes, \"In what? Escape in that U-Haul they're gonna,\" she goes, the cops are\ngonna be looking for in five minutes?\" And I went, and I just\nremember thinking, oh, wow. And keep in mind all of my IDs, everything are in the storage\nunit that she has a key to. Like, I'm not getting those. It's over. - Yeah.\n- I got an ID right now that says, my name is Michael Eckert. - Yeah.\n- I'm driving a, I'm driving a U-Haul van. - Yeah. Sounds like she has a\nlot of negotiation leverage. - Right, so we start\narguing back and forth and she says, \"$100,000.\" - Yeah,\n- \"I'll give you 100,000.\" I said, \"I'll take it.\" She counts it out. She counts out the 100,000. Later, when I recount it,\nit wasn't even a hundred. It was like 98,000.\nThat's fine. It's fine. So, but you know, we've\ngot them all marked, you know, 2000, 5,000, 6,000. She's like, \"2000, 5,000, 12. That's it.\" She ends up stiffing me. That's fine. It's not my money. So I take it, I end up, you\nknow, I take it, I leave. And as I'm leaving, she'd always called me before on the phone and\nbegged and pleaded and cried. \"I messed up. Please\ngimme a chance. I'm sorry. I'll take my medication. I'm sorry. I thought it was better.\nI thought it was okay.\" And I remember walking\nout, I put my cell phone on the counter and just\nwalked out, went downstairs, got in the truck, and drove, and drove. When I got to Louisiana, I stopped at Baton Rouge and got a, I mean, at some point I stopped and I got like, I think I got a room or something at one point. I know I stopped. - [Lex] So you drove\nwithout a plan essentially? - I drove back to Charlotte to get my car. - Got it.\n- So I can't be driving. I can't drive this car.\n- Yeah, right. - So I stopped at Baton Rouge at one point"

I call a few people at home,\nback home, call my mom. She's in tears crying. My dad's\nyelling in the background. I call,\n- What's your mom? Just a small tangent, what\ndid your mom and dad say? You remember, anything\nstand out to you as? - No, my dad, you know, you know. \"Well, I hope you're happy. You know, your mother, every time someone mentions\nyour name, your mother cries.\" Which is funny to me, 'cause like, growing up,\nlike he was never concerned about her crying, you know? So it was like, since when\ndid you care? You know? And I just, so I mean, my dad, like, he's an alcoholic, you know, he's been sober for\ntwo years, a month and a half. Drunk, drunken, binge or\ndrinking, sorry, drinking binge, and then sober for six months and then did it again, then sober. You know, it just went back and forth. And in and out of alcohol,\nyou know, drug programs. But like I said, worked for\nState Farm and State Farm, he was a top selling manager. And so what they would do is, they'd put him into a 30 day program. And I mean like a, like,\nhe has to stay there. And they had, they were\nthe only ones that had that kind of control, 'cause they're like, \"You're gonna do this and you're gonna pass\nit, or we're firing you.\" You know? He made a lot of money and he made a lot of money for State Farm. And he hired and trained a ton of agents, and he had one of the\ntop performing agencies. So he was worth a lot to them. And, but, so I end up, what ends up happening\nis I'm driving through, I get that phone that I\nwas telling you about, and I call, so I call, talk to my mom. She's, you know, she's crying. She's like, \"I love you so much. You know, I just wanna\nmake sure you're safe.\""

How's it?\" She's like, \"Oh, Matt, man,\nyou know, what's going on? FBI's everywhere, like they've\nbeen talking everybody.\" They, you know, and this\nhas been, it's like a year and a half at this point. And she's like, \"It's\nnot, you know, they're, they come around every once in a while. Everybody's gone in. Everybody's cooperating,\neverybody's talking, everybody's blaming you,\" including her. And so as we're talking,\nshe said, \"Look, I've, the main FBI agent on the case. She told me if I ever spoke\nwith you to have you call her.\" And I was like, \"Yeah, I'm good.\" So she goes, \"Her name is Candace. And she wants you to call her.\" She goes, \"At least call\nher for God's sakes. Maybe you could just turn yourself in. Maybe you can negotiate\njust like a couple years. Like a 'cause they're, if\nthey're not gonna catch you, then maybe turning yourself in. Maybe it'll help, at least hear her out.\" And I was like, \"Okay,\nall right. You're right.\" Hang up the phone. I call\nCandace, she picks up the phone. I go, \"Hey.\" She goes, \"Who's this?\" And I go, this is \"Matt Cox.\" And she goes, \"Hey, hello\nMr. Cox, how are you?\" And I go, \"I'm doing okay. How's it going? I understand you wanna talk to me.\" She goes, \"I do.\" I said,\n\"What can I do for you?\" She says, \"You can turn yourself in.\" I go, \"Well, that's not gonna happen.\" I said, \"What else do you need?\" And she said, \"I think\nthat you should think about turning yourself in.\" I said, \"Why? Well, what am I looking at?\" She goes, \"Well, that's not how it works. Way it works is you turn yourself in and you know, we take\nthat into consideration.\" I said, \"Mo, no, no, no. I\nsaid, that's not good enough.\" I said, \"I'm not stupid enough to turn myself in and hope for the best.\" So she says, \"Well,\nlet's talk about this.\" And I said, \"Well, what am I looking at?\" And she goes, \"I don't really know. I can't, you know, really, I can't tell you that.\" And I said, \"Well, then\nwe don't really have anything to talk about.\" She goes, \"Well, wait a second.\" She said, \"Let me, hold on,\nlet me call the US Attorney. Maybe we can work something out.\" So she calls the USD. So I said, \"Okay, I'll call you back.\" And she said, \"Well give you your phone\nnumber, I'll call you.\" And I went, \"No, no.\" I\nsaid, \"I'll call you.\" I said, \"I'm gonna hang up the phone. I'm gonna turn the phone off.\" I said, \"For all I know,\nyou're triangulating this phone call right now\nor something, you know.\" And she goes, \"Oh, give me a break.\" She goes, \"You're not that important.\" And I remember thinking,\nwho do you think you are? Like, she, like, right. Like you're just some little\nfraudster guy running around, you know, like, you're not a terrorist. You know, like, and I almost, I almost was like, \"Oh,\nokay, here's my number,\" which she probably already had. But I almost like, was like, \"Oh, okay, I'll wait for your\ncall,\" and left my phone. I said, \"No, you know what?\" I said, \"I'm gonna hang up the phone. I'm gonna turn off anyway,\nand I'll call you back.\" She's, \"All right. Whatever.\" I hang up, I turn off the phone. It turns out I found out later when I ordered the Freedom\nof Information Act. She actually immediately\ncalled the US Marshals. And they immediately called,\ntook the phone number and tracked back the phone and immediately had two\nmarshals from Baton Rouge, go immediately to the\nplace where I had been. - Damn.\n- Oh, listen. Yeah. I mean-\n- They work fast. - Yeah, she's, oh.\n- And she's good too. - Not just that. I made the initial calls\nsitting there in that, where I went and bought the phone. It was like a gas station. There was also like a Subway station. I had ordered like a Subway,\nI was eating a Subway, playing on my computer, programmed the phone\nand making phone calls. So by the time I talk to her, and they're driving,\nby that point, I walked and gotten into the vehicle,\nmy vehicle, and I leave. But, you know, who knows? I don't know if they\nshowed up 30 minutes late. I don't know. Like, I could have hung out, like, oh, I'm just gonna finish my food. Could have shown up. So I go, I call her back\nan hour or two later. She says, \"Listen,\" you know, the first time he wasn't,\nhadn't got back with her. Then he did, then he came\nback, he said, seven years, he's gotta turn himself in here. So, okay, seven years.\nThat seems like a lot. And I was like, seven years. And that's seven years for, I go, and I kept saying, \"Is that\nseven years for everything?\" And she goes, \"Yeah,\nthat's for everything.\" I was like, \"That's everything. Like, everything in that\nhappened, like in Atlanta, like and some stuff that\nyou don't know about.\" She said, \"Look, what's important is you turn yourself in, in Tampa.\" And I was like, \"Okay,\nwell, I'm closer to Atlanta, why wouldn't I turn myself in in Atlanta?\" And she's like, \"Look, you\nknow, you don't wanna do that. You don't wanna do that.\" Well, 'cause that would've been, the Secret Service would've gotten credit if I'd walked in there, right? So, you know, and I don't\nknow anything about rivalries and how they work at that time, I do now. But, so we go back and\nforth, back and forth, and I continually ask her, \"Does that include\nAtlanta and everything?\" And at some point I realized like, oh, she's just not answering. And so finally I said, \"Listen, you keep dodging this question.\" And she said, \"All I\ncan speak for is Tampa. So if you come back to Tampa and you cooperate against\neveryone seven years.\" And she's telling me she wants me to cooperate against my ex-wife. And I'm like, I'm not gonna do that. I said, \"My ex-wife didn't do anything. She doesn't know anything.\nShe didn't do anything. She's never,\" you know, \"Well,\nthat's not what I heard.\" And she's going on and on. And I was like, \"No, no.\" I was like, \"Oh, wow.\" I was like, \"So that's just for,\" and she's like, \"That's right.\" I said, \"All right, we're done. She goes, \"Mo, wait, I can\ncall the Atlanta US Attorney.\" I said, \"Nah, lady, I wouldn't believe you if you told me water was\nwet, I don't trust you.\" And I hung up the phone,\nthrew it out the window,"

So I bring it back. I go to my old apartment\nin downtown Charlotte, and I remember thinking I would be okay. And I know by this point that they knew Michael Eckert's name. They had the address in Charlotte. So I know they, by this point,\nit's been five, six days. So I know they've tracked him back there. So I figured if I could\nget my car, I'm fine. So I go into the apartment complex and it, you know, it's\none of those four or five, six story apartment. You know, those are parking\nthings that stack up. So I go into this, you know, underground, it's not underground, but whatever, this parking garage thing. So I go in, I'm on like the\nthird floor or something. I look at my car, you\nknow, and I get in my car and I remember as soon as I walk, drove out of the parking garage, I\nwas like, \"Whew, I'm good.\" So I can go ahead and\npull across the street and stop at Starbucks. So I stop at Starbucks,\nI walk into Starbucks. I order Starbucks. I'm standing there\nwaiting for the barista. I look over and it's two people from the apartment complex staring at me. Like, that's, I'm like,\nand they're whispering and pointing and none. And I remember thinking, this is like the fifth of the month. I hadn't paid my rent.\nI hadn't been there. So I thought that.\n- All right, makes sense. - Yeah, this, maybe they, like, I'm picturing an eviction notice or a three day notice\non my door or something. And I'm like, okay. And then one of them bolts\nout the back, the woman, there's a guy and a girl. The woman runs out the back. He's standing there staring at me. I get my venti vanilla latte, right? I get my little, I get my fru fru drink. So I got my fru fru drink. I walk out, I get into\nthe car, he follows me, get in the car, I set everything up. I put my seatbelt on. I'm okay. He's standing there staring at me. You know, I'm thinking something's\nwrong, like, what's up? And all of, and I check\nto see there's no traffic. I'm good. I'm about to, about to leave. And he starts screaming, \"He's\nright here. He's right here.\" I look in the rear view mirror. There's two guys running\ntowards the back of my car. I punch it and I take\noff. Sounds dramatic. Wasn't that dramatic. I'd\nalready, there was no cars. I knew there was no cars\nalready pulling out, you know, it wasn't like a TJ Hooker where I jumped over the, slid across the hood and you know, they didn't catch the car and hang onto the back. But, you know, so they're\nrunning and I boom, hit it. (Matt imitates tires screeching) - Did you spill the coffee or? - No, 'cause it was one\nof those little things. It was actually nice.\nBut, but it just sounded- - You're making it sound\nlike you were pretty calm. Weren't you panicking here? - I was terrified. - Yeah.\n- Terrified. - So what, you're under fear,\nyou're still operating like- - Yeah, I operate, like I-\n- Calmly. - It's funny you say that, because the Secret Service, when they talk to these guys, they, all\nthe people that they spoke with said the same thing\nover and over again. \"The guy was a professional.\nHe never seemed upset. He never seemed agitated. He always, he was never in a hurry.\" - Yeah.\n- He, you know, like, but most of the time, I wasn't because I, you know, it wasn't until the police got involved, or, so the law en federal\nlaw enforcement got involved that I started really,\nyou know, getting anxious. So at that point, I drive, I take off, I drive about a mile down the road. - Who were the two guys, by the way? Was it-\n- I thought it was FBI. I ordered the Freedom of Information Act when I got to prison at some point, you know, in the future. And it was US Marshals, right? So-\n- Sounds pretty dramatic to me, US Marshals\nrunning towards your car, you pull, I mean- - I mean,\n- Yeah, but it's all right. - It's hard not to tell\nit like it's dramatic. - I understand It was, there was not much traffic, goes. Okay.\n- Yeah, it's not like their, you know, their fingers were at the back of the car, they're holding on, you\nknow, but it was, yeah. If I had waited an extra 20 seconds, yeah, they would've been on my car. They would've been\nright there at the door. - Did you consider giving up there, or no? - No. All I could think of was haul. Listen, my instinct is get out is go, go, go, go, go, go. - You're already on the run.\n- I'm already in trouble. It's not like they're\ngonna be, they're gonna, it's, they're gonna add anything. Although, to be honest,\nyou know, it only got worse because at that point,\nactually at that point, I drive down the road, I\nstop at a homeless facility. I survey three guys. I'm a mile down the road, like looking back on, I\nthink, what were you thinking? But there were three, three homeless guys that were in their early 30s. And they were, they were all\nCaucasian. That's hard to find. So trust me, I've looked, spent hours before track and finding these guys. - So that's like the golden\nthing you're looking for is, white guys in their 30s.\n- Right. Because that's, I was in my thirties, I wasn't an old man like I am now. So I survey them, I drive\nstraight to Nashville. Get to Nashville. Drive through\nan area called Green Hills. Well, at first, when I got to\nNashville, I stayed the night. And the next day I went into,\nI'm gonna say a UPS store. It was actually a Kinko's. There used to be some, they\nused to be called Kinko's. - But I go-\n- I remember Kinko's. - Oh yeah.\n- They got bought by FedEx, I feel like.\n- Oh, is it FedEx? FedEx, okay. Then it was a FedEx store. - So I go in there.\n- Oh, Kinko's. - And you give them like\n50 bucks or something, or 20 bucks or something. They'd give you like a\nhundred business cards. So I go get a burn, a phone\nnumber, a burner phone. I go in there, I make up, oh, I call and get a phone number\nfrom HQ, the local HQ. I come up with a name\nmanufactured funding group. I've got two phone numbers. I get business cards made with a name. One of the guys named that I surveyed was, his actual name was\nJoseph Marion Carter Jr. I went by Carter. So I get business cards\nmade of Joseph Carter. I then drive through Green Hills, took them like an hour to get the card. So I'm driving through Green Hills. I'm planning on going to an apartment, but I'm still, I don't have\nan ID, I don't have anything. Like I'm wondering how,\nwhat am I gonna do? How am I gonna get a place to stay? I'm gonna stay in a hotel.\nLike, what am I doing? I'm using an a, an ID that\nthe cops are looking for. So as I'm driving, trying to find this big apartment complex, there's a guy putting a\nsign in the front yard of like a townhouse. 'Cause several townhouses, and I probably in his 60s, I pull in, jump outta the car, and I\nsaid, \"Hey, is this for rent?\" He said, \"Yes it is.\"\nAnd I said, \"Oh, okay. Yeah. Can I see it?\" \"Sure,\" I go in, check it out, come back downstairs, it's perfect. I said, listen, you know, I\nwork for a company, you know, manufactured funding\ngroup, boom hand him thing. I said, \"I've been in, in Europe for the last,\" I forget what I said. I said, \"England,\" I\nsaid, \"Little town outside of London in, you know,\nwhatever, Dexter, you know, London for the past five years. I don't really have any credit. But I said, I can put down\ndouble the security deposit or, you know, whatever you need. Here's my business card.\" He looked at me and he looked at my car and he goes, \"You look\nlike an honest young man.\" He said, \"I'll, take\nthe first month's rent and a deposit.\" And he said, \"Now go\nget a lease right now.\" And I said, \"Okay.\" And I said, \"Oh, okay.\" Filled out a lease right\nthen, gave me the keys. Like nice, like very\ntrusting in that town. - Well that went, oh yeah. But there must have been\nalso something about you where you're just. - I mean, I don't-\n- Got a nice car. - Look, I know what you're,\nyou're gonna get a lot of comments that say white privilege. But that's what, that's what you're- - I think the charisma has\nsomething to do with it, yeah. - Well, so he gave, I appreciate that. So he gave me the keys. Listen, I ordered all of Joseph Carter's vital information, right? Like all of his birth\ncertificate, Social Security card, everything that night from like a Kinko's or some of the, I forget where, but from some one of these\nplaces I went online. You could go online back then, right? Like, there wasn't wifi everywhere. So I ordered the stuff, it\nshows up a couple days later. I take that information, I go and I get a driver's license. We're talking about within like seven or eight days, I've got a\ndriver's license in his name. I get in that car, Michael Eckert's car. I drive it all the way back to Nashville. I leave it in long-term\nparking, get on a plane, fly back to Nashville, go in\nand buy myself a brand new car. It wasn't brand new, it\nwas a couple years old. But from like CarMax,\nwent in, within two weeks, I'm completely 100% set up. I start dating for three, four months. That gets really boring. - Where again? In Nashville you said? - Nashville.\n- Okay, got it. - So I started dating a bunch of chicks, and then I end up meeting this one girl. - By the way, are you lonely here? 'Cause you're on the run, is that? - Man, listen, being, I'm\ntelling you right now, being on the run was the\nbest part of my life. - Really?\n- Everybody, you know how all these guys say, \"It was horrible. And I was always so concerned\nand looking over my shoulder,\" and it wasn't, I wasn't,\nkeep in mind, I've gotten, I've gotten five or six traffic\ntickets while on the run. I went to traffic school as someone else. I got so many traffic tickets in his name. I went to traffic school as him. Like, if I got pulled over,\nlike, I'm not concerned. - So your confidence just was over the top.\n- And I'm driving a vehicle in the name of the driver's\nlicense that I have that was issued by that state. Yeah. Full coverage\ninsurance. I'm not an idiot. I'm not driving around a stolen car with a broken taillight\nand a body in the trunk. Like I'm covered. Like, I'm not concerned\nabout the local cops. - Plus you're gonna\nStarbucks sipping your coffee and driving away from US Marshall. - Right, right. That was-\n- You could start believing that it's impossible to catch you. That is exactly what it is. It's every time I just kept getting more and more emboldened, more\nand more cocky, arrogant. Like, they're not gonna\ncatch. I'm too good. You know, which is great\nuntil they catch you. And so I meet a girl named Amanda Gardner. Well, what I end up\ndoing is, keep in mind, I've only got 100,000 or so. So I go and I start buying houses in the area in this area called JC Napier next to, it's just close to downtown. And I buy these houses and I start record. I buy them for like 60, 70,000. And I record the sales at 210, 190, 205, that sort of thing. Same thing. And I refinance the houses. I start pulling out money. I meet this girl, Amanda Gardner. We hit it off within a few months. She's moved in to, we move\ninto a house in that area. I renovate a house. We move in there. I borrow three and a half million dollars. And I'm buying houses now. I'm buying houses, recording the value. I started all over, you know,\nI borrow like, whatever, three and a half million dollars. I meet Amanda, we move in together. We're buying-\n- Do you tell her? Do you tell her about what you- - She kind of, you know,\nwhat she knew was that, you know, it's odd, right? I have no photographs.\nEverything I own is brand new. She's like, \"You don't,\nthere's nothing in this house that's more than four months old. So six months old, you\nhave no photographs, you have no internet presence,\nyou have no, you know, it's, every stick of clothing is brand new. You don't have old pairs of jeans.\" - Do do you tell their\nstories about the past of any, like is there a fabricated - Initially there was a fabricated version that I owned a, I owned\na mortgage company. My typical story was like\nI owned a mortgage company and I got bought out by Household Bank, started doing very well. I got bought out by Household Bank. I have a no non-compete clause. I got, you know, I ended up\nwith like half a million dollars after paying off all my bills and just decided to kind\nof travel around the US And now I'm here, I'm gonna\nstart renovating houses. But that, you know, you don't call home, nobody calls you, your\nfamily doesn't call you. You tell stories about your\nmom, your dad, your brother, your sister, friends. I don't know any of these friends. Never seen any of these friends. They never call you. They never, you know, it's\njust like, it's like, ah shit. So at some point, I\nbasically just said to her, \"Look, I am,\" listen, at one point I had to have a check cut. I refinanced the house, right? And I had like, I wanna say,\nI'm gonna say something like, it might have been 30,000,\nbut let's say 20,000. I had a $20,000 check\ncut to Amanda Gardner. 'Cause you have to have these checks. You can't have them cut to me. So I would say, \"Hey, there's\na second mortgage on there.\" And I'd provide a second mortgage or I'd provide, you know,\nI'd provide different things. And I knew if I need names of people to cut these things to. So I had a check cut for whatever. So I remember we're at dinner one night. This is before she really knows who I am. And I said, \"Hey.\" I said, \"Oh.\" And she goes, \"Oh, did\nyou had a refinance?\" She said, \"How'd that\nthing go? You refinance?\" I go, \"Oh, thank God you said that.\" Boom. I said, \"I need you to deposit this.\" Give a check for 20,000. She's like, \"I can, I can go tomorrow. And I can deposit it and I,\" and I'm like, \"No, no.\" I'm like, \"Look it,\nit's fine, just deposit it.\" She says, \"I can get,\nas soon as it clears, I'll get you a cashier's check.\" I was like, \"No, just deposit\nit and keep it in your bank. It's fine.\" So she's like, \"What is going on?\" You know, and so we have this conversation and I tell her, \"Look,\npeople are looking for me.\" \"Who?\" \"Law enforcement.\" \"Which ones?\" \"All of\nthem,\" you know, she's like, \"Tat doesn't even, for what?\" I go, \"Mostly bank fraud.\" And she's like, \"Well, how\nare they not finding you? I mean, everybody, you know,\npeople know you like, you know, your general contractor, which\nI met four months before. This guy six months\nbefore, two months before.\" You know, she's like, \"So and so, so and so, so,\" and I'm\nlike, \"Right, right. Well,\" I said, \"Well,\" she's like, \"I mean, they've got your name, they've got your,\" I go,\n\"Well, that's identity theft.\" And she was like, \"What do you mean?\" I said, \"Well, my name's\nnot, you know, my name's not, it's not Joseph Carter.\" \"And what is your name?\nWhat is your name?\" I go, \"Look, you know, you don't need, don't even worry about it. This is what's happening.\nThis is where I'm at.\" And this has been months\ninto the relationship. I mean, this is, or I'd say\nmaybe a month or two in. But you know, she was\njust too inquisitive. And, oh, I know what it was. She found like $40,000 in cash in my freezer one night. That was another thing that happened. She went to get a Popsicle and she opened up the\nflip to get a Popsicle. And she opened the wrong\none and there was all cash. And she was like, like,\nyou know, \"The other day,\" you know, in this\nconversation, \"The other day, I opened up the Popsicle\nbox and there's cash.\" And I'm like, so I kind of explain it, but I had a feeling she's not gonna, she's gonna be okay with this, you know? - So she was okay.\n- She was okay with this. - I mean, to me, that's just a fascinating conversation to have. Like. - It was a great conversation. - 'Cause oftentimes in relationships, you learn about each other\nand you find out new things. And here you find out-\n- That's a doozy. - Yeah, it's a good one to find out. (Lex laughs) The name you're using\nis not your real name. And the secret service, the FBI and everybody else are looking for you. - Yeah.\n- And you're like, to be honest, you're\nnot a violent criminal. So it's like,\n- And I, you know. - You know.\n- But she didn't know my name. Like, she was like, she, and I told her, I said,\n\"Look, if you start digging, if you find out my name, like I'll leave.\" Like, there's certain\nthings that catch you staying in contact with\npeople that, you know, that's how you get caught. You know, going back to see people, that's how you get caught, you know, telling people who you are, that's how you get caught. And I was like, \"So, I'm Joseph\nCarter, everything's fine.\" And she was like, \"Okay,\" you know, and keep in mind too, this girl, do you, \"Oh, your car's broken, or\nyour car's not doing well? Take it and trade it in. We'll go get you another car. We'll go get you, you know,\nan Infinity, you know, FX or whatever, you know, a\n55,000, $60,000 vehicle.\" She's driving the equivalent\nof a beat up old Nova. You know, I mean, it's, you wanna go on vacation,\nwe'll go on vacation. You wanna do this, you wanna do that?\" So, you know, we're buying\nhouses, we're renovating houses. We're building brand new\nhouses. We're buying lots. Like, she's like in the middle\nof this, like holy Jesus, there's hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank,\nin our bank account. Her bank account. I open up\na corporation in her name. She's opening up bank accounts, she's got web, there's websites. It's a lot. And while this is happening, we start seeing a friend of hers. So this other girl comes in\nthe picture, her name's Trina. And Trina is semi lesbian. So-\n- Is this like a sexual thing? - Yeah.\n- Or actual relationship? - No, it's, no, it's more like a, she's coming over a couple times a week. - Okay.\n- So we've got a ton of tons going on. And, how do you put this? So while this is happening,\nI end up coming out in like several magazines. So I'm thinking this\nwhole thing's dying down, but it's not dying down because now I just got caught\nand handcuffed in a bank, walked outta the police\nstation, outran Marshalls. Although that part, the Marshall thing never was never in the papers. But the getting caught and handcuffed in the bank, when that hit the papers,\nthat's everywhere, bro. That's huge, you know. Suddenly \"Chicago\nTribune's\" running a series, \"The Fugitives,\" I'm in\n\"Bloomberg Business Week,\" they run an article called, you know, \"Sharks In The Housing Pool.\" Then you've got a \"Fortune\nMagazine\" comes out with a thing, because by now, guess what? Becky's been caught. - Oh, Becky.\n- Becky. Oh, Becky. - [Lex] Is she in Houston or whatever? - In Houston, got caught.\n- And did she? - But gangster, bro. Like the way she, here's the thing. - [lex[ Hey. Hey. There you go. - No. Oh no. She told on me immediately. - Oh, she did? Oh no.\n- Yeah. It's fine, she did the right thing. So here's what's funny about that though. - I don't know about that. - [Matt] She, here's what she says. - Loyalty is everything\nin this world, my friend that you and I disagree on. - I just took off. I just took off - Still.\n- On her and left her with, listen, with like six or like five or $600,000\nis what I left her with. - It's not all about money, Matthew. It's also about just like,\nyou know, ride or die. There's a meaning to that. - My God.\n- I'm sorry. Go ahead. - So-\n- She told, she said everything. - Well, here's what, when I say gangster, when she gets caught, - [Lex] Yeah. - They come in, she's in\nthe middle of beauty school. She's paid for beauty school, she's going through beauty school. She's gonna open like\na salon or something. So she's in there cutting hair in a class, you know, on a mannequin. And all of a sudden, like five or six Secret Service agents\ncome in, guns drawn, screaming, \"Get on the ground, get on the ground.\" She said, \"Everybody\ndropped to the ground.\" She said, \"I'm sitting there\nwith scissors going,\" you know, they grab her, they handcuff\nher, they bring her in. And the whole time. Now, at\nthat point, she was Rebecca, well she was, yeah, her\nname was Rebecca Hickey. She went by Becca. So she's\nRebecca Hickey, which is a, you know, she's got a\nTexas driver's license, the whole thing. And they're screaming at her and they put her in the car and they're driving the whole way. She goes, \"Listen,\" the guy, the Secret service agent\ntold me 45 minutes, she's telling us, \"You're\nlosing your job, bro. You're losing.\" I mean, he goes, he's like,\n\"I couldn't believe it. Like we've got pictures of her. We're like, 'This is you.'\nShe's like, 'That's not me. Are you insane? Look at\nthat chubby little thing.'\" I mean, like she's just. Would not budge till they\nactually put her hand on the scanner. And she goes, \"okay, I'm Rebecca\nHauck. What do you need?\" They're like, \"Where's Matt Cox?\" She's like, \"I have no idea. That fucker left me like a year ago.\" So.\n(Lex laughs) so.\n- But she contributed to the story, to the legend\nthat's already growing. - Oh, because she was\ninterviewed by \"Fortune Magazine\" and it was horrendous. The article is horrendous. \"He was abusive, he's a Don Juan that forced me to fall in love with him, commit mortgage fraud, and\nthen took all the money and left,\" by the way, they\nfound like 40 or 50 grand on her and maybe another 30 or 40 in her bank account\nand no other money. - Yeah.\n- Where's the other money? So anyway, and she was, by\nthe way, she got caught. She was in communication with her family. So she's talking to her mom. - [Lex] That's when she\ngot caught, ultimately. - And her mother, through\nmultiple conversations, one conversation being,\n\"Mom, I'm doing fine. I can't tell you where\nI am, you know, exactly. But I'm in Houston, Texas, I'm fine.\" Next one, \"Six months later,\nI enrolled in beauty school,\" Houston, Texas Beauty School. How many are there?\n- Yep. - And her mom, bipolar. \"I just wanna see my daughter. I'm gonna call the Secret Service.\" - Yep.\n- \"I'm doing the right thing.\" And honestly, she is\ndoing the right thing. So-\n- So you're getting"

      "text": "more and more famous. - It's bad.\n- Nationally. - [Matt] Right. So I've\ngot all these houses. - You're having a threesome\nwith Amanda and Trina. - And what ends up happening\nis we end up going on, you know, and listen,\nAmanda and I, we've gone on, we've gone to Greece, Italy, Croatia, we've gone,\nwe're going on multiple, just multiple trips. And when we had just gotten\nback from like a 10 day cruise of the Greek Isles, and, there's, we get home\nand Amanda goes online and there's a blog about\n\"Dateline,\" about their, one of their new specials\ncalled \"The Thief Of Hearts.\" And that's me. Apparently\nI'm the thief of hearts. And I'm apparently going around and I'm, and it's based on, you\nknow, Rebecca's, you know, Becky's story that I'm\nwooing women to commit fraud, stealing all the money, and then leaving them to hold the bag. Well, they interviewed her. They're interviewing multiple people, multiple in my case,\nthey put together this, they're putting together an\nepisode, gonna be released in a few, in a month or so. So I'm terrified, I've, at this point, I've been on the run three years, and I'm like, I mean, there's\nlots of things I could care less about \"Fortune,\" I don't know anybody that reads \"Fortune,\"\n\"Bloomberg,\" come on. I hang out with, I'm\nhanging out with contractors and laborers and you know, I'm not hanging out with these guys. So, you know, local news, who cares? You know, even, even local news channels, you know, I don't care. But \"Dateline,\" there weren't\n400 channels back then, you know, so \"Dateline\" comes out, even if you don't see it the first time, they're gonna rerun it in\nthree months or six months, or five year, 10 years from\nnow, they might rerun it again. My face is gonna be on it.\nSo I could be perfectly fine. Five years from now and one\nday, the barista that I go to every other day looks at \"Dateline\" and goes, \"Oh my God, that's Mr. Johnson,\" or \"That's Mr. Thomas,\" or whatever. So the point is, is that I\nwas like, \"Yeah, I gotta go. I can't stay here. I gotta\nget outta the country.\" So I was gonna go to, well, we\nreally started doing research and Amanda ended up saying, Australia. Australia, at the time, I\ndon't know how it is now, but at the time, if you went to Australia with like $100,000 and a business plan, you could become a permanent resident alien. You can't vote. But you can buy property, you can open a business,\nbut you can't get a job. And they didn't require our fingerprints. So there's no criminal background check. Now, if you wanted to be a citizen, you have to get an FBI\ncriminal background check. Like I got, no, I'm good. So I was like, wow, I can go\nthere and start a business, and I'm gonna start show\nup with a couple million. So what we do is we\nstart refinancing houses, we start pulling out\nmoney as quick as we can. I'm asking guys, laborers,\nguys that I work with, my general contractor, my\nreal estate agent, \"Hey man, can you cash this check for six grand?\" You check, nobody says no, everybody. \"Yeah, no problem, no problem. No.\" A few guys like, \"Yeah,\nman, if you give you 10%.\" \"Yeah, I'll give you 10%.\" So that's happening.\nWe're pulling out cash. One day Amanda gives Trina a bunch of checks and asks her to cash them. That sparks a conversation that\nlike what it was happening. She confides in. By this point, by the way,\nAmanda knows who I am. So by this point, she's\nactually came across the letter that I wrote to my\nparents when I left Tampa. So she's figured out who I am. She tells Trina, \"His name's Matt Cox, 'Dateline's' coming out,\nwe're gonna, we're leaving. We gotta get a bunch of cash.\" And Trina goes, \"Okay,\nI'll cash the checks.\" And what she does instead is\nshe calls the Secret Service, they watch my house for three days, I come home one day, they pull the cars up (Matt imitates brakes screeching) and they arrest me. So, you know, it's a little bit longer than that, but that's shorter. That's a short version\nof me getting arrested. And you know, I've probably\nskipped over a whole- - So simple, because you've gotten away with much more complex situations. - It's women man. It's women. Just joking. (Matt laughs) - They also are the thing\nthat make life worthwhile. - Listen, God bless Trina,\nshe did the right thing. It, honestly, based on-\n- There you go back to the right thing. - But I mean, based on what she saw, based on what the Secret Service told her and what then the articles\nthat she's reading, I'm a bad guy. I mean, I'm a bad guy in general, right? So I don't deserve\nloyalty, I don't think so. I'm ripping people off and she's thinking that her\nfriend is in danger, you know, the FBI is saying, I have a weapon. \"He's dangerous. He's got a weapon.\" You know, \"We believe\nhe's armed and dangerous.\" When I was in Florida, I had\na concealed weapons permit, but I had gotten rid of both my guns when I was placed on probation. I've never had one since. I've\nnever touched a gun since. But they used that to\nsay, you know, they said, \"Oh, he had a concealed weapons permit. Okay, well then he's armed and dangerous\" Like, there's these little things and things they're telling\nher, \"Read this article. Look, he forces girls to\nfall in love with them. That's what he's gonna do to your friend.\" So she negotiated a also,\nI think she got 10,000, I think, which is embarrassing. I'm ashamed that she got $10,000. - And said everything. - Yeah, and told them,\n\"This is where he is. His name is Joseph Carter.\" You know, \"This is where he is.\" They watch it, they\ngrab me, they arrest me. They bring me downtown. You know.\n- What did you feel like when you got.\n- I didn't feel good, bro. It was bad. It was a bad\nday. It was a bad day. First of all, \"Casino Royale\"\nwas coming out on Friday. It was the first Daniel\nCraig as James Bond. And the whole week I'd\nbeen telling Amanda, \"I'm gonna go see 'Casino Royale.'\" She go, \"Okay, well on Saturday we're gonna go to the festival.\" I go, \"That's fine, but\non Friday 'Casino.'\" And she's like, \"Right, 'Casino Royale.'\" And then she's like, \"Okay, by the way, on Thursday, I thought\nwe could go to dinner.\" \"That's fine. But on\nFriday, 'Casino Royale.'\" And when they put the handcuffs on me, one of the first thing I thought of, I'm not gonna fucking see \"Casino Royale.\" I'm not gonna get to see\nit. Not gonna see it. And I saw it about five, six years later and when on the\ninstitution's movie channel, you know, it was nice. It's not the same. But yeah, so they bring me to Nashville, then they transport me\nto all over the place. I go on, you know, Con Air,\nthey fly me to Oklahoma, they fly me to Atlanta. Then I go to Atlanta, I'm placed in the US Marshal's, holdover. I get assigned an attorney,\ngo in front of the judge, plead not guilty, meet with my attorney. You always plead not guilty. You know, whenever you ask people say, \"Can you believe that he pled not guilty?\" That's the first thing you, nobody walks in and pleads guilty. You plead not guilty while\nyou kind of figure out what you're gonna do. So I plead not guilty.\nThere's no bond, obviously. I've got, they caught\nme, when they caught me, I had four or five passports. So that's no good. They charged me with,\nyou know, bank fraud, conspiracy, commit bank\nfraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, passport fraud, conspiracy, or what was the other,\naggravated identity theft, money laundering, use of\na fraudulent passport. You know, and there's like, you know, 30 counts of this, 20 counts of this, 20. None of that matters, like\neven if you just took the, dropped all the counts to\none count stacked them, it's like 150 something years. Not that they're-\n- Yeah so everything, everything they put.\n- Yeah. And that's what they always say. \"You're looking at 150,000,\" you know, and your\nlawyers, they're like this. \"You're not looking at that.\nYou're looking at 54 years.\" What? That's no matter.\nThat's no matter. So yeah. So my lawyer comes in and sees me one day, you\nknow, like our first meeting. And I, she says, you\nknow, \"I'm Millie Dunn,\" and she says, \"Listen,\nI've looked at everything, for first they say you're responsible for, it's like 25 or 20 or 30,\n25 or $26 million in loss.\" And I'm like, \"That's, I've\nnever, that's not true. That's not true.\" And I was like, \"You\nknow, not even, I said, maybe not even potential law. There's just no way, I\nmean, there's just no way.\" And then they come back, she comes back and she says, \"Well,\nthey're saying 19 million.\" And like, \"It's not possible. Tell you anything. I don't, I didn't, no.\" So when the FBI's saying like 40 million, they're saying 11.5 in Tampa, plus 40 million for the mortgage company. So that, it ends up being like, plus what I stole on the run, it ends up being like 55 million. But she gets them to drop like the 40. Like that's just brokers. That's this, that's that. Drop it. And they're like, \"He's so\ndone. It doesn't matter.\" They drop that, so it ends\nup being like 15 million. And then it's down to what does he owe? They said, \"9.5,\" and I got\nit down to like 6 million. So, you know, which,\nyou know, I'm good for. So what ends up happening\nis they've charged me with all these things and she's like, \"Okay, you know, you're like, you can plead guilty and you can go with the\nsentencing guidelines, which is gonna be like,\" she's\nlike, \"I mean, it depends.\" She said, \"It might be whatever, 54 years\" She goes, \"But if they run\nthem, you know, concurrent or consecutive, depending\non which one they do,\" she said, \"It most likely it\nends up being like 30 years.\" You know, it's like, that's\nnot good. That's not good. So we kind of go back\nand forth, back and forth and figure out, try and figure out what I'm looking at. Now as we go through the\nwhole thing, we end up, she ends up with, she\nends up saying, you know, she knocks off a bunch of stuff\nthat they're saying I did, you know, at enhancements, because you'll have a base\nlevel enhance, a base level of let's say a level eight. You know, that should be, that\nshould be maybe a few years. But then they start adding\non enhancements, you know. \"Did he, did what he do,\nwas it sophisticated?\" Yes, okay, three levels\nfor sophisticated means. \"Were there more than, how\nmany victims were there? More than 50 victims?\" Yes. Okay. That's six more levels. Okay. \"Did he change the\njurisdiction to evade detection?\" Yes. That's four more levels. Okay. \"Did he,\" they start adding boom, boom. And when you start adding\nup all those levels, plus your criminal history, and I have a big criminal history because I was already on federal probation and I committed a new\ncrime on federal probation. So that was another enhancement. And this, you know, this case.\nSo I'm in like a category. I'm like category two or three. So they come back and they're saying, I forget, it's like 20, well, they don't come back right away, but she ends up saying, \"You're probably looking at 14 years.\" Okay. That's reasonable.\nThat's reasonable. And so she's saying, so\nwhen we get the PSI back, we eventually get what's\ncalled a pre-sentence report. They're saying 26 years. Well,\nthey really said 32 years. And I argued, and we got it down to 26 years and four months. That's what it is. It's 316 months. That's how they do it in months doesn't sting that much,\nI guess if she say months. - Yeah. - So she says to me,\nMillie sits down with me and she says, \"Listen,\nyou gotta cooperate.\" And I was like, \"Okay.\" And she said, \"Because you're guilty. You're extremely guilty.\" She's like, \"You can't go to trial.\" And she said, \"So you need to cooperate.\" I was like, \"Well, what\ndo I get if I cooperate?\" And she said, \"The way\nit works is you cooperate and you hope for the best.\" And I was like, \"Are you serious?\" \"You tell them everything you know, and you hope for the best.\" And she's like, \"What part\nof the problem is,\" she said, \"Everybody in Tampa's cooperated. Rebecca has cooperated. Everyone across the board has cooperated.\" She goes, \"There's nobody\nthat hasn't cooperated.\" - By the way, when you say cooperate you mean they're an informed, they told, they said, they AKA snitched.\n- Yeah. Right, they came in, they\nsat down with their lawyer and they said, \"This is what he did. He did this, he did that.\" They showed him documents. \"Yes, yes, yes, that's my signature. I didn't know what that was.\" You know, everything was my fault. They didn't do anything. It was all me. So they've all cooperated and\nthey haven't been charged. They've been indicted, they're all named as unnamed co-conspirators\non my indictment. So I've got like 12 people. And there's like probably\n20 people there involved, but there's like 12 of them that are, so I've got all these names,\nyou know, KB, DL, CY, you know, it's like, I know who that is. Like I know who DW, that's Dave Walker. I know who you know, I\nknow who these people are. And so there's just a list\nof, there's like 12 of them, you know, plus me. So, and some of them walked\nin and said, \"I'm guilty. I just wanna be plead guilty.\" The girl, Alison, she walked in, said, \"I'm too, I'm tired of waiting for you to come get me.\" Walked in with her lawyer and said, \"I just wanna plead guilty.\" And they sentenced her\nand she went to jail. She got like 36 months or 30 months. She called the prison. She went to the low security,\nit was a female prison at the time, female camp. Called the camp and asked\nfor if she could come by for a tour before she went. And they went, \"Excuse me?\" She said, \"Well, I'm going to be there for about two years,\nso I'd like to come in. Is there like a tour I can take? 'Cause I like to know where I'm going and what it's gonna be\nlike, how I should prepare.\" And they just started laughing. They said, \"There's no tour, sweetie. We'll give you the tour\nwhen you get here.\" (Matt laughs) You gotta love that. Like, she- - [Lex] Yeah, I mean.\n- I thought I was, I didn't think, I thought\nI was not prepared. I mean, there's no tour.\n(Lex laughs) - So Becky, Becky got 70 months, but when I got caught\nand when I was sentenced, they reduced it to like 30 or no, 40 to 40 months they reduced. - 'Cause she cooperated.\n- Cooperated. - That term. Right. - Do you want to say snitched or ratted?\n- Well, there must be, I mean, snitch is too harsh of a word, but yeah, the ratted, I mean, you're saying, I don't know. - Well, we can get there. We'll get there. - All right. All right."

And by this point I realized like, you don't have a choice, you know? No, that's not true. I\ncould have been a gangster. - Yeah.\n- What does it mean to be a gangster in this case? - Like a standup guy. I could have said, I'll just take it, give me 54 years, go fuck yourself. I'm not gonna snitch on nobody. And I know you look at me\nand you think, tough guy. I'm not a tough guy at all. I'm not doing 50 some odd years. Like, I'm not doing it. I don't wanna do 30 years,\nyou know, I was hoping for, you know, I knew it wasn't possible, but I would've satisfied\nfirst another slap on the hand like I got the first time. I really thought I deserved, honestly, when you,\nwhen my lawyer asked me, \"What do you really think you deserve?\" And I thought, I deserve 10 years, you know, I deserve 10 years. But, so she said, \"Look,\nthey wanna talk to you.\" So the FBI, well, first,\nthe Secret Service flies in. They come in and they interview me. - Who's more terrifying?\nFBI, Secret Service? - You know, the Secret Service was so overwhelmingly professional. the FBI, and really only,\none of the FBI agents that interviewed me, I don't\nknow how he's an agent. I don't know. He was just\nineffective, incompetent. - [Lex] Oh, so it's a competence issue. - The other one was Candace. - Oh, you met her eventually.\n- Of course I did. Of course, she's-\n- But what was her open line? - 511 wearing three inch heels. - Yeah.\n- She's a giant and in impeccable shape, attractive. One of the angriest human\nbeings I've ever met. And every FBI agent that I've\nmet since then that knows her, and I've mentioned, they all say, \"Oh, what you think of her?\" And I'm like, \"What? Why?\" They go, and I was like,\n\"Kind of aggressive.\" They go, \"Yeah, yeah, she's a bulldog.\" I mean, all of them are like, \"Yeah, yeah. She's something else.\" Like-\n- Secret Service is a little bit more like professional. - Very personally, very,\nyou know, it's their job. It's like, \"Hey, this is just my job.\" They're polite, professional,\nyou know, that's it. So it's just, this is just\na, this is my nine to five. So, but they come and they fly in and they meet with me\nfor three, four days. One of the funny things is that when I first first sat down with them, the one guy's name was Dan,\nlike Broskowski or something. So, he sits down and he says,\n\"Look, before we get started, we need to talk about something.\" And I said, \"What?\" He said, \"We know you've hidden money and we,\" you know, and I was like, \"What?\" And he goes, \"You know, we\nknow you've got money hidden.\" I said, \"I don't have any money hidden. What are you talking about?\" And my lawyer's like,\n\"Do we need to talk?\" I'm like, \"No, no, no,\nno. I don't have nothing. I gave you everything. I gave you all the accounts,\nyou got everything.\" And he's like, \"You're looking at an obstruction charge at this point.\" I was like, \"I don't have anything.\" And he says, \"We know you have money. We know you have money in different IDs, different identities names.\" And I go, \"What are you talking about?\" And he pulls out a bank statement and he slaps it on the counter. And he goes, \"You've got money in Southern Exchange Bank. You've got $190,000 in\nSouthern Exchange Bank.\" And I look at it, and I went, and it was in the name Walter Hulk. And I went, \"Did you call the bank?\" He says, \"Yeah, we called the bank.\" I went, \"Okay, did anybody call you back?\" And they go, he said, \"Well, no, we've left several messages.\" I said, \"Did you go to the bank website? He goes, \"Yeah, I went to the website.\" I said, \"What'd you think?\" And he went, \"What do you\nmean, it was a bank website?\" I said, \"Yeah, but it\nwas professional, right? It was like a professional website.\" And he goes, \"It's a bank website.\" And I go, \"Yeah, but\nit's, it was well done.\" And he goes, \"Oh God.\" And I go, \"Yeah, convincing.\" And I went, I go, \"It's all an illusion.\" And I said, \"The bank doesn't\nexist. It's a fake bank. I made the bank, made it when\nI was in, not even in Tampa. I think I got into\nNashville when I made it.\" And I was like, yeah, it's an illusion, the bank statements.\" He's like, \"They're\ncolor bank statements.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, well, no shit.\" So, you know, there's no,\nI said, \"A matter of fact,\" I said, \"Who did you leave a, I haven't paid for the service in months.\" And he turned around and he called it and it went, you know. (Matt imitates dead phone ringtone) you know, it was disconnected. And I was like, \"How do you\nnot know that's a bank?\" Well, it turns out there was\na Southern Exchange Bank, and I'd used their bank routing number. And so, I mean, I always thought\nthat was funny that they, it was like, well, I remember really for a split second there, I was kind of like really embarrassed\nthat they called me. I was like, I can't believe\nthis, you're the Secret Service. Anyway, I talked to them. I, you know, there's, there's really, as far as the Secret Service is concerned, there's just not much I can tell them. There's just, you know, like it was me. Becky's already told them everything. Amanda's already told them everything. It's not hard to track. Now when they raided my house, they've got boxes and boxes. So it's laid out. We\nstill, it took forever. Like I still went through everything. I explained how I got\nthe driver's licenses, how I made the bank statements, how I made the birth certificates, how I, the whole social\nengineering of figuring out how to, what these little loopholes are. It's like seven days\ntotal with these guys. So. - You mean like in like question? - Yeah, it was like, they\nquestioned me for all day, and then they take me back\nto the Marshalls holdover, and then the next morning I wake up and they chain me up\nagain and bring me back. - What's that like? What's that process of questioning? Like, are they, I mean, you're somebody who is exceptionally good at\nconversation, charismatic, it was part of the games you played. Are they good at conversation? - I mean, you know, the problem is, they're not there to shoot the shit. You see what I'm saying? Like, they have an agenda. - But they have to use their words to get information outta you. Aren't they trying to manipulate you? - I'm not holding anything back. - Okay.\n- I'm not, it's not like I'm sparing Jim, you know, it's trust me, Jim's gotta go. I mean, you're looking at,\nyou're there 20 some odd years, but Jim can do five. Bill can do some, Tom can do six. I don't even like, I\ndon't even like Jerry, Jerry can do 20, you\nknow, so I'm ready to, I'm ready to cut everybody's throat. - But you're not guaranteed\nthat, that you're not, you're getting anything for that. - Right, and all my\ntime, I've seen one time where an inmate got a guarantee\nto have his sentence reduced and it was signed by the head of the FBI, was Robert Mueller, gave it to him to have a conversation with him. That's the only time I've\never seen that document. - Okay, so a lot of days with both the Secret Service and the FBI. - So FBI was, Candace was\nirritated, didn't like me. And I remember when I, she took the cuffs off, I\nwas like rubbing my wrist. She goes, \"Your wrists hurt.\" And I go, \"Yeah.\" And she goes, \"Get used to it.\" I mean, she was just an asshole. - Yeah.\n- Just all around. Not that she didn't have a right to be, but everybody else was professional. - Yeah.\n- So. (Matt laughs)\n- Oh, Candace. - So we, you know, we talked\nfor three or four days with the FBI. And you know, they asked\na ton of questions. They brought a ton of, they\nbrought documents, you know, so it's like, \"Hey, who signed this?\" You know, it's like, \"Oh,\nthat's not my signature. That's so-and-so's signature.\" Or \"I signed that. I\nsigned that. I signed that. That's so-and-so.\" \"Where'd this check go? Who is this?\" \"Oh, that's so-and-so,\" you know, you're looking over everything. One of the things they\nwanted to know about was, which I never talked\nabout, 'cause it seems, seems so minor, is I\nbribed the politician. I got him elected because we got him elected\nto the city council so he could vote to get the lots, we bought like a hundred\nvacant lots in Ybor City. And I wanted them all, they\nwere all single family. We wanted them zoned multifamily. And so we bribed him and got him elected. - That doesn't seem minor. - It's not as sexy as the rest of stuff. - That's pretty, I mean,\n- That's a whole nother thing. Like I mean, you know.\n- All right. - So what happened is when they got all of the bank accounts, they see all these checks\ngoing to Kevin White. And so they're like, \"Why did James Red donate $500 to Kevin White? Why did Brandon Green donate?\nWhy did Allen Duncan donate? Why did,\" and you know, so I\nhad explained to him, \"Oh yeah, well, he was, we wanted\nhim to be city councilman. So we paid, you know,\ngave him a bunch of money so he could run the ads\nso he could get elected so he could then get all of our stuff.\" But because he never did, you\nknow, I took off on the run before he was able to do that. And then he ended up getting,\nnot long, too, too long after that, he ended up\nabout five, six years later, he ended up getting indicted for bribery, but not mine on somebody else's case. - Can I take a small tangent here? - Yeah.\n- And ask how many politicians do you think commit\ncrimes, are a little bit, or a lot criminals? - I mean, I think there's\nsome ways that are, you know, they're seemingly legal. - The aforementioned gray area. - Well, that's not gray. Like this guy was, like, at one point, I couldn't find anybody to\nwrite $500 checks anymore. So I just gave him cash. Like, I'm just handing him\nseven, $8,000, $10,000 in cash. So, but you know, I think most of them have legal ways\nto make ungodly amounts of money for, you know, influence. You know. But is it legal?\nNo, they're politicians. They've made it so that it's not illegal. If you really sat down and explained it to someone, you know, the average person would\nsay that's not right. That, \"Oh, no, no, that's legal.\" - So, okay, so at the\nend of these few days, what was the sentencing like? - Yeah, I end up, I go to sentencing. I get my PSI back and\nit's 32 years to life. - Yeah.\n- And so we argue about it with the prosecutor\njust before sentencing, and they get it down to\n26 years, four months. And then Millie says,\n\"Listen, don't worry, 'cause I'm trying to\nbackpedal at this point. I'm like, I might as well go to trial. If I lost at trial. I\ncouldn't get more than 30.\" You can't, well, more than 32 years. 'Cause you can't get life. 32 was the max. It's just like a mistake. He said 32 years to\nlife, you can't get life. So it was like, the most\nI can get is 32 years. So I was like, I'll go to\ntrial. Might as well go to trial and see if I can get them to reduce some of these enhancements. She insists that she can get\nthe enhancements knocked down. And if you read, they actually\nread the enhancements. Some of the enhancements,\nthey didn't apply to me. So she goes, and you know, I believed her. And I think she, she\nmade a valid argument. We get to, we go to sentencing. My mom's there, she's\ncrying. My dad's there. He's looking at me like he's disgusted and crowd, there's a\nwhole bunch of reporters, like the whole place is packed. And I'm, I plead guilty. Millie gets up, my lawyer gets up and she argues these enhancements. And every single time, you know, the judge is like, \"Eh, I disagree. You know, overruled.\" And it's like, boom, \"Five\nmore years,\" you know, bam. \"Six more years.\" Bam. 'Cause if she had won the enhancement, she argued I would've got 14 years. Now, keep in mind too, prior to this, a month or two prior to this, the US Attorney had\ncalled Millie and said, \"Look, 'Dateline,'\" \"Dateline\" had already\ncome out by the way. Remember I was worried\nabout \"Dateline\" coming out. Well, it had come out, but\nthey wanted to do a follow up because it came out like a month or two after I got arrested. And they were saying,\n\"Hey, we wanna recut it with interviews with him.\" Well, Gail McKenzie wants,\nthat's the US Attorney. She wants me to do that. And she says, \"I'll consider\nthat substantial assistance.\" Now, when you cooperate\nwith the government, they consider it substantial assistance. That's what they call it. So I cooperate with you,\nit's substantial assistance. She says, \"If he's\ninterviewed by 'Dateline,' we'll consider it substantial assistance.\" And Millie says, \"You have to do it.\" - By the way, what's the idea behind that? That like, you serve as a warning for others or something like that? - Yeah, exactly, she's like, \"You know, you become a cautionary tale. Like, don't let this happen to you.\" So I go and I'm interviewed by \"Dateline,\" Keith Morris, or whatever his name is, you know that guy.\n- Yeah. - Mr. Cox was, you know, that guy? So he comes and he interviews me, Becky's interviewed, I'm interviewed. Amanda's interviewed, like\nAlison is interviewed, like everybody, the Secret service agent, I think has interviewed like everybody, prosecutor's interviewed. You know, it's funny, at\nthe time I would've, I was, when I watched it, I was like, \"That's not true, and that's not true. And that, and,\" and\nhonestly, it's like 99% true. It's like looking back on it.\n- Yeah. - You know, I'm like, you know, like, \"My Audi TT wasn't\nblue, it was silver.\" You know, it's just stupid. But anyway, so I'm interviewed by them and they recut it and they air the video. So, you said this was\nsubstantial assistance. And then the other thing\nis, I was interviewed by the FBI and the Secret Service. Now my lawyer calls the\nprosecutor the night before sentencing and says, \"Look, he was interviewed by \"Dateline\" and he was interviewed by the\nSecret Service and the FBI. And if you do that, you said\nyou'd reduce his sentence, you'd consider it substantial assistance, and you would reduce his sentence. What are you going to ask for his sentence to be tomorrow at sentencing?\" And she said, \"We did consider\nit substantial assistance and it's just not enough.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Nobody was arrested.\" \"Yes, but what about \"Dateline?\" \"Millie, I don't know what to tell you. It just wasn't enough.\" - We considered it.\n- We considered it. We will consider it. And\nthey did consider it. So.\n- Oh man. - Yeah, that's like the,\nthat's, you have to really, you know, the meaning of\nwords is so important. - I'm gonna use that at some point. I will consider it.\n- I'll consider it. - I'll consider it. I considered it.\n- It's not. (both laughing) So-\n- And still feel the same. - So she calls me, I'm crushed. And she's like, \"But look, you know, they're still investigating. They're gonna make these arrests.\" And so when you get a sentence\nreduction at sentencing, it's called a 5K one. When you get a sentence reduction after sentencing, it's called a Rule 35. So she said, \"We'll file a rule 35 as soon as the arrests are made. \"Okay.\" So I go to sentencing and Millie says, \"You're\ngonna get 14 years. I'm gonna argue these enhancements.\" She argues the enhancements,\nshe loses the enhancements. Not that she's not an amazing attorney. She's an amazing attorney.\nThe judge wanted to hammer me. He hammered me. You know,\nMillie was a great attorney. She was always polite to me. And by the way, to this day,\nwill answer my phone call. Like most public defenders,\nyou call them now, you call them after your sentence. They don't don't answer\nyour call. Great person. - Thank you, Millie.\n- I didn't give her anything to work with. You know, it's like I'm a\nlittle overwhelmingly guilty. It's like there's no defense. So I end up getting sentenced 26 years."

      "text": "- That's a lot of years. - I would like to tell you that they, when they gave me the time, you know, that I was stoic and I stood there and I took it in, you know, but the truth is, I cried like\na baby, like a small child. Like you've never seen anyone\ncry like this in your life. I was just, how did I get 26? How, what did I do to get 26\nyears? Like murderers, rapists. I've met guys that\nkidnapped guys that got 15. - 26.\n- So yeah. - Were you scared?\n- I mean, you know, does a pope wear a funny hat? Like of course I was\nscared, I was terrified. - Yeah.\n- I mean, you know, but I kept telling myself, \"Ah, they're gonna reduce the sentence. They'll reduce it, they'll\nreduce it, they'll reduce it. Like, okay, okay, okay.\nIt's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.\" You know, but it wasn't okay. I got sent, I got moved to Coleman, the Coleman Complex in Coleman, Florida, the Federal Correctional Coleman Complex in Coleman, Florida, which is the largest\ncomplex in the nation, federal complex in the nation. There's a, at that time, there was a camp, which was a female camp. There was a medium security,\nsorry, a low security prison for men, a medium security\nprison, and two penitentiaries. And so I get moved to the medium. Now I'm moved to the\nmedium, not because like, that's where like real\ncriminals go, right? Like I'm a soft white boy. Like, I'm no danger to anybody. Like I hurt someone's feelings once, but other than that, I'm\nnot gonna be a problem. But if you have more\nthan 20 years to serve, you have to go to a medium. So even though my security\nlevel said this guy should be in a camp, I had 20 years. So if you have, you can't go to a camp till you have less than 10. So as soon as I am given\n26 years and, you know, 26 years, they knock off three, but you still have three\nyears to get below 20. So they go to the medium. So I go to the medium and\nthere are guys getting stabbed. The very first day\npeople are being stabbed. I get locked into, you go\nto my cell, meet my cellie, they scream lockdown. Somebody got stabbed in the rec yard. I remember I asked my cellie, which I met 20 minutes earlier. I was like, \"What's, you know,\" he's like, \"Hey, we\ngotta get in the cell.\" I was like, \"What's going on?\" He goes, \"Somebody got\nstabbed in the yard.\" And I go, \"Somebody just got killed?\" And he goes, \"Nah, they just\nstabbed him up a little bit.\" And I thought, oh my\nGod, you're in a place where they say stabbed\nhim up a little bit. Like, you're not prepared for this, bro. You gotta get outta here.\n- Yeah. - So anyway, I go to the medium. I'm there. - Like, what was the first day and night? - Remember, I already had been locked up. - Yeah.\n- In the county. And they're county jails\nwhere they call them US. They're US marshal, they're holdovers, but they're really county jails. They just keep you with the federal guys. So I'm not mixed in with like, hobos and, you know, people like that. Like, I'm mixed in with\nthe federal people. - So already felt like a prison? - Yeah, I mean, it's a prison. I mean, it's jail, but it's a prison and unless you've been locked up, you don't really know the difference. So it's a jail. Jails\nsuck. Jails are much worse. The whole time I was locked up in these, in the jails waiting to be sentenced, guys were like, \"I just\nwanna get sentenced and go to prison, bro, I just.\" And I was like, \"Why does\neverybody keep saying that?\" Like, prison's worse than this, bro. Like, I saw :Shawshank,\"\nlike, it's horrible. And they're like, \"Bro,\nprison, listen, prison, I can walk the rec yard. I could go to the movie\nroom, watch movies. I'll, listen within, right after count,\" for this four o'clock count, they count everybody at four. So they are like, \"Right after count, I'm gonna go to commissary. Somebody's gonna buy me an ice cream, I'm gonna be eating an ice\ncream, walking on the rec yard the first day,\" like, and I'm,\nyou know, it's been months and months and months,\nand I've been locked up in this county jail and I'm\nthinking, I wanna go to prison. Like that sounds nice. I'd\nlove, I'd like an ice cream. - Yeah, but there was a stabbing\non the first day, sort of. - Yeah, well, you know,\neverybody kept telling me I was gonna go to a camp,\nyou're gonna go to a camp, you're gonna go to a low. - I see.\n- You know, and honestly, I was very quickly, I was\nwalking on the rec yard. I was, you know, so I was\nat the medium, I got there, you know, it's a real\nprison with the doors, bam. And they can open the little tray thing and feed you outta the tray and there's a stainless\nsteel toilet and sink. And you know, they have\nthat in the county too. But, you know, it's exactly what you think of prison as being. - But it feels like a\nfundamentally different experience when it's 26 years and the door locks and- - Yeah. So I, yeah, I have a, a cellie and, but I'm also, as they sent me\nto a prison where guys have, tons of guys have 30, 40, 50 years, you know, life sentences. There's gangsters there,\nthere's murderers, there's serial killers, there's,\nyou know, really bad guys. There's, you know, there's\nguys that are, you know, trying to take advantage of guys, right? - Yeah like sexually or?\n- Yeah. But by the time I got there,\nI'd heard all the, you know how you can get yourself in trouble. You know how you can, like, don't go in somebody else's cell. You don't know the guy,\nyou're not 100% sure, do not go in his cell,\ndon't even go near his cell. Don't go into places where\npeople can close a door behind you or they can\ntrap you in an area. Don't, you know, there's all these things that I've been told not to do. - Again, for sexual reasons?\n- Right? Because I'm a small guy in prison. - Yeah.\n- You know. - Trapped a white dude. - Yeah, it's a problem. It's a problem. This. - Yeah.\n- It's bad, it's all bad. - Well, it's good in the outside world, but bad in-\n- You know. Yeah, my fear was there, make\nme shave my head to make sure that the mop wig fits correctly. - Yeah.\n- But there's certain things that, I always hate to say this,\nbut I mean, and it doesn't, this is the simplest\nway to say it, is that if you get stabbed in\nprison, you had it coming, you did something. Like they're not running\naround just stabbing people. You did something. You, and the things that\nget you hurt is you argue over the TV, what channel you wanna watch. You got 50, 80 guys watching one TV. Don't argue about it. Like it's none of just not worth it. Borrowing things that\nand not returning them, that's a problem. Running up debts, that's a big problem. You know, gambling, gossiping, you know, those are the problems. Those things get you hurt. Not\nbeing polite, be respectful. I'm super respectful. So I was respectful, very quickly when I got to Coleman, there are continuing education courses. One of the courses is\nresidential real estate. The guy that was running\nthe residential real estate didn't wanna do it anymore\nbecause he was doing legal work and it just was taking too much time. So he came to me and said,\n\"Listen, you just got here. You got a real estate background\nlike nobody else does. Can you take over this class?\" And I was like, \"Sure.\" So I looked at his curriculum, I kind of rewrote it a little bit and I started teaching them\nresidential real estate class. And at one point I was\nteaching two classes, like a semester or a quarter. And these guys loved it, bro. Like everybody, they all\nthink they're gonna get out and flip houses. So I started, you know,\nfrom the fundamentals, I talk about credit, how to\nborrow, how hard money lenders, different types of bar, like, everything. And, you know, guys are walking, it's the first time in\nmy life, this was funny. Not that I think I was really in a, ever in a position for this to happen. This was really odd though. Probably the second or third\nclass when guys are leaving and I'm having to check them off the roll, multiple guys are stopping\nand saying, \"Yo bro.\" Putting their hand out and shaking my hand and going, \"Good class,\nit was a good class, bro.\" Then I have guys coming to me telling me, \"Hey, what are you teaching these guys?\" I go, \"What do you mean?\" he goes, \"My cellie's telling me he's gonna get out and make millions. I'm taking Cox's real estate class. I'm telling you I can do this.\nI'm gonna be a millionaire.\" And it's like this flipping houses. Like this is not.\n- Yeah. - But the truth is, if you know it is the, flipping houses was, what I\nbasically told these guys, especially the drug dealers, right? You're a drug dealer and you\nwere raised in the projects, and you're going back to\nthe projects like this is, this is the one industry or you know, that you will thrive at because you're a hustler. You're not afraid, a 45-year-old divorced white woman is not going into\nthe hood knocking on doors to try and flip houses. But you will. And you know, everybody\nin the neighborhood and you'll knock on those\ndoors and you'll hustle and you'll, you've been told no before and you don't care and you're not scared. You're not this. And there's tons of money to\nbe made in lower income areas. And so, and then when I\ngo through the whole thing and how you can leverage, you\nknow, leverage your credit to borrow money to get into the property and rent, do the renovations\nwith very little money down. And I do the whole thing. These guys, like, they loved it. So I was, and what that\ndid for me was two things. One, if you got to the class,\n40 guys show up for the class. And I say, \"Look, if you don't want to go, you don't wanna be here, you just want it 'cause your counselor's\nmaking you get a certificate. You don't wanna be here, that's fine. Bring me two coffees and like\ntwo creamers from commissary and I'll fill out all your\npaperwork and you'll pass. You'll get a certificate. I\ndon't have to see you again.\" I have full of coffee and creamer, 'cause at least 10 or 15\ndidn't wanna be there. The other guys seriously\nwanted to be there. And I don't want those\nguys to be there anyway. They're gonna be a problem. So the other guys are serious about it. And some of these guys sat\nthrough the class 2, 3, 4 times. Some of these guys got\nout and sent me money. So, you know, which is like\na huge sign of respect. You know, by the way, 'cause\nthey don't owe me anything. But I did that and I taught GED because, you know, I, you have\nto do something for money. And, you know, I met some,\nI met a bunch of cool guys and I was hanging out\nand I was doing well. And after about three\nyears, they transferred me to the low security prison. At this point, like the\nFBI starts showing up, asking me questions. They asked me questions about\nthe politician I bribed, you know, asked me questions about him. Statute of limitations was up and they were trying to tie\nhim into the bank fraud, 'cause his name was Kevin White and one of my guys' name\nwas Michael, Kevin White. And so they were trying\nto tie him in, you know? \"Did you, did he know about it? 'Cause if he knew about it, statute of limitations is 10 years. We could,\" \"No, he didn't know.\" Should've thrown him in there. But anyway, 'cause like a couple years later he gets indicted, he\nends up going to jail anyway. - And it could've decreased your sentence. - Yeah. Listen, listen. Stop, stop. - Listen.\n- Oh my God, - I got all my judgment out after the homeless conversation. - [Matt] Listen, it's\nonly gonna get worse. - I mean, I really appreciate your honesty and your insight about, like,\nabout snitching, honestly, that I have a sense that there's at least a desire for\nloyalty in the world. - I, wouldn't that be nice? - Did you ever feel in\ndanger in medium or low? - It's funny. I had more problems at the, probably at the low than I did the medium. But at the medium, the only\nthing that happened was, an article came out in the newspaper when I was at the meeting,\nit came out and said, 'cause they're, you know, they're still investigating things. So this article comes out and I'm on the front page of\nthe \"St. Petersburg Times.\" It was about the politician, big article. And in the article it says, they interviewed Millie, my lawyer. And she says, \"Well, when\nMr. Cox was being interviewed by the FBI, one of the\nfirst things they wanted to know about was this politician.\" So she just said, \"Mr.\nCox was being interviewed by the FBI.\" So I immediately get taken into custody and they put me in the\nSHU, in the hole, right? For my own protection. And\nI'm there for like 45 days. And then after 45 days, they're like, \"Cox, what do you want us to do? You want us to ship you?\" I was like, \"No, put me\nback on the compound.\" I'm like, \"Half the guys here cooperated.\" And he goes, \"Yeah, it's more than half.\" He said, \"But this is the guy from SIS,\" which is like their internal security. - So that's when he told you, that it's actually much higher percentage. - Right, but he goes, but 90 per, he said, \"But 100% of them are lying about it.\" He said, \"You just came\nout in the newspaper.\" I go, \"Man, I'm not concerned.\" If he's, \"You are concerned, you gotta come immediately\nto the lieutenant's office and tell us, we'll ship you.\" I said, \"Okay.\" I get out there, people\nare giving me like the, looking at me and, \"What's up,\" you know, but I don't have a lot of friends anyway. And I didn't come there to make friends. And so at one point,\nthis one guy comes to me, I'm walking the yard\nprobably two days later after I get on back on\nthe compound, I'm walking. The guy comes to me, he has a goatee and he's got a, it comes down here and he is got a skull,\nlike a little skull thing he had made whittled\noutta wood or something. And, you know, definitely looked scary. But, so I'm walking and he stopped and he goes, \"Hey Cox,\" I've never talked to these guys. I had been there for a year or so and never talked to any of these guys. They're all like bikers and\nyou know, Arian brotherhood. And so, you know, I'm\nlike, \"Yeah, what's up?\" He said, \"Bubba,\" Bubba's their leader. He goes, he goes, \"Bubba told me to tell you not to walk the yard. He don't wanna see you out in the yard.\" And I went, \"Okay.\" I said, \"Well, I'm gonna\nwalk the yard tonight.\" I said, \"And if I get\nthe shit kicked outta me, then I get the shit kicked outta me.\" - But did you talk back to a guy with a wooden skull hanging off his beard? - I did, but you know what, it was right in front of the guard shack. And so there's guards in\nthe guard shack, you know, like, they're 20 feet away.\n- Really? You weren't scared? - I mean, I think I just got numb. Like I'm not stupid, but\nI'm all, I'm walking around. I'm, you know, I was scared\nfrom the moment I got there on, if that makes sense. So you get to a point\nwhere you're just numb and you're waiting for it. Especially when I got outta\nthe SHU, got outta the SHU, I went straight to my cell, laid down. Couple minutes later it was locked down. They closed the doors, I\nwake up the next morning, I go to chow, I go to my job,\nlike it starts all over again. So I was, I had a very packed routine, so I didn't spend, although\nthere's guys everywhere and I'm thinking at some point I might just be walking around. A guy might walk up and\njust smash me in the head. But it didn't happen. And it's not, the guys\naren't getting stabbed, but they've got it coming. I didn't tell on anybody\nhere. I didn't do anything. It's not that on other yards I might not have gotten smashed,\nbut I didn't get smashed. And I'd been there a while and I taught the real estate class, and everybody wanted to take real estate. So I think that insulated me to a degree. I also had made a few friends there, and I think they were probably also kind of putting out the words like,\n\"Bro, cut this guy a break.\" So I'm walking across and I tell the guy, I said, \"Look man,\" I said, you know, and\nI wasn't rude to him. He wasn't even rude to me, really. He said, \"Don't walk the yard anymore, Bubba doesn't want you\nto walk in the yard.\" I said, \"Well, listen, I'm gonna go to chow and then\nI'm gonna go out there tonight and walk the yard, and if I\nget smashed, I get smashed.\" I go, \"Because I got 26 years and I cannot walk around\nfor the next 26 years, not going on the yard.\" I said, \"So I'm gonna be there and if that happens, then that happens.\" And he looked at me and he goes, \"Man, I don't give a fuck what you do.\" He's, \"That's what Bubba\ntold me to tell you.\" He said, \"I told you.\" And he goes, \"I don't\ngive a shit what you do.\" And he walked off. I went out there that night with a buddy of mine named Zach, a\nguy named John Gordon, with my cousin and a\ncouple of his buddies. We walked the track for about an hour. Bubba and a group of his guys\nstood there and looked at us. And as we walked, probably\nclosest we got to them was 30 or 40 feet, that\nwent on for 30 minutes. And then they kind of broke up\nand went their separate ways. And you know, there was a\ncouple of times where I would go to the chow hall and I would go and I'd be sitting at a\ntable and Bubba would walk up and tell the other guys at the table, \"I wanna let you guys know you're,\" he didn't even call me a snitch. He said, \"You're sitting\nwith a cooperating witness.\" He said, \"That's how you wanna roll.\" He said, \"You ain't gonna be rolling with us if there's any trouble.\" And then they all kind of looked at me and they got their plate\nand they moved off. He didn't tell me to move. And he could've walked up and said, \"This is a snitch, motherfucker.\" He didn't do that. Bubba\nwas very respectful. So as respectful as you could be in that situation.\n- Whatever you wanna say about Bubba, he was a respectful man. You ever talked to him directly? - Never had a conversation with him. So that went on. But I mean, not, when I say\nthat went on, I mean like, literally, like that's a couple of times. He said the same thing to\na guy in line one time. Guy came up to me later and said, \"Look, man, but I'm sorry, Matt. He was standing next to me in line. Bubba said something to him. He went like 10 or 15 people back and stood in line. Later on he came up to me, \"Matt, I'm sorry bro,\nbut you know, Bubba.\" But I said, \"Bro,\" I\nsaid, \"Look, I get it. We're not friends, don't worry about it.\" And here's the thing, at\nsome point there, I got, I ended up getting, well,"

      "text": "the FBI started showing\nup there at the prison questioning me about my files in Tampa, the one of the 12 guys that were indicted, they show up and they\nstart asking me about it. And so they're still kinda working it. Well, at the same time,\nI end up getting moved to the low security prison. I get the low security prison. They show up over and over again. But at some point they come to me and they say, \"Look, we\nwent to the US Attorney, we presented everything we have. I have enough for an investor. I have enough for to\nindict all of these guys.\" I think it was whittled down\nto maybe eight instead of 12. And they said, \"Look, the entire economy's melting down.\" At this point, these are, some of these are four or five years old. We don't, we've got banks that\nare melting down right now. We got a hundred, 200, 300 million, 500, half a billion dollar banks\nthat we're investigating. We don't have time to deal with this. We're not gonna in, we're not\ngoing to indict those people. So they get away. The agent I was working with, her name was Leslie\nNelson, very nice person. She came, actually didn't have to do this, came to the prison to tell\nme this is what happened. And when she'd first come\nto see me, I told her, \"Listen, I wanna do all this, but no matter what happens, I need you to write me a letter. If they don't, and if they\ndon't indict these people, I need you to write me a\nletter that I can present to the US Attorney on my behalf that I did everything I could.\" And she goes, \"I'll do that,\nbut that's not gonna happen. We're gonna get the indictments,\neverything,\" I was, \"Okay.\" So of course a year later she\nshows up after nothing happens and they dropped the case, she shows up and she tells me what happened\nand he's not gonna do it. And I was, I go, \"Do you\nremember that you,\" she goes, I got the letter right\nnow,\" gave me the letter. She goes like, \"That's it.\" Great letter. You know, it says, you know, \"Mr. Cox has worked,\" you\nknow, blah, blah, blah. \"He's done this,\" this is great. And even said, you know, \"He deserves a reduction in\nmy opinion,\" blah, blah, blah. So, but there's no, there's\nnobody, nobody was arrested. So I call my public defender, I called Millie, I explain it to her. And you know, she starts, you know, she starts crying and she's sorry. And, \"Well, what are we gonna do?\" Well, there's nothing you can do. You're time barred. Like you have one year to file a 2255, which is to say that your\nlawyer is ineffective, or that the court has made\na mistake in some way. And it had been over a year, and it had been years,\nit'd been like four years. And she's like, \"Yeah,\nI mean, you're just, there's nothing you can do.\" And she's in tears. And I kind of feel like I'm done. At that point I'm done. And what I do is I start\nwriting a book, right? I write a memoir, my memoir. And this is not a shameless\nplug for my memoir, by the way, which is amazing, just saying. But so what happens is, I actually write it, you know, I write it and then I have to rewrite it, right? 'Cause I don't really know\nwhat I'm doing, you know, and I've been reading true\ncrime and that sort of thing, and I've always liked true crime. I get a literary agent, comes to see me, tells me I have to rewrite some stuff. We rewrite it. As I'm finishing up my\nmemoir, there's a guy that comes on the compound, and\nhis name is Efraim Diveroli. Efraim Diveroli and his business partner, a guy named Packouz, were selling munitions, AK-47 rounds. Really tons of munitions. But they got in trouble with this, and they were selling\nthem to the US government for the Afghani Security Forces. And there had been an article in \"Rolling Stone Magazine\" about him. And I'd read it and\nsomebody points him out and says, \"Hey, that's that guy that's,\" and I went up to him, I said,\n\"Hey, bro, you just got here?\" He is like, \"Yeah.\" And I said, \"Look, if\nyou wanna write a memoir or anything, I'm finishing my memoir. I can always help you. I can help you write an outline. You can get a professional writer, whatever is you need help,\"\nhe's like, \"Yeah, all right.\" Efraim Diveroli was played by Jonah Hill in the movie, \"War Dogs.\" So a few months later, he comes to me and says, you know, \"Hey,\nthey sold the movie rights.\" I was like, \"Oh wow, that's great.\" And I'm like, \"And you\ndon't wanna write a memoir?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, man, it was sold to the guys from the \"Hangover\" movie. And I was like, \"So the guys from the \"Hangover\" movie are going to make a movie about you.\" I said, \"You understand,\nthey're gonna call it like, 'Dude, Where's My Hand Grenade?' And you're gonna be Spicoli from \"Fast Times At Ridgemont High. Like, you're gonna be a joke, all because you don't wanna write a memoir and get your version out there.\" And he was like, \"Holy shit.\" So I end up writing an outline for him. We worked together, and then he asked that,\n\"Can I read your book?\" And I was like, \"Sure,\" and I\ngive it to him and he reads it and he comes back and\nhe said, \"Bro,\" he says, \"This is the best thing\nI've ever read in my life.\" And to be honest, I\nlater found out he'd read about three books in his entire life. But still, it was very, it was very nice. - Still to bring out the other two. - So he asked me if I'll write\nhis book, I write his book. We work out a deal. And we do that 'cause, and I'm saying all this because I basically settle in. I'm done, I'm gonna do 26 years. - By the way, just in a\nsmall tangent, how did you, how did you know you'd be good at writing? - I'd kind of written a manuscript prior to even taking off on the run. I used to listen to John\nGrisham books, you know, I'd listen to him in the car. Like I like John Grisham books. And I'd actually written a manuscript about a mortgage broker. You know, he writes about\nlawyers and it's like, lawyer, being a lawyer is not exciting. If you can make that sound exciting I can make being a mortgage broker. And I wrote a book, you\nknow, put it at my desk and you know, the FBI found it. And they had, you know,\nsaid, \"Oh, it's a blueprint to the fraud that he's going to commit.\" It wasn't, stop, it's as much, that character was as much me as John Grisham's characters are him. - But it's still kind of interesting that- - It is\n- Because John Grisham didn't. - Right, I mean, you know,\nif John Grisham did something similar to what one of the, you know.\n- Yeah, I saw a quote somewhere that the\ncriminal is a true artist and the detective is merely a critic. Something like that. Does that resonate with you or not? - I'll have to look that up.\n- Okay. So you already knew you could write? - Well, I knew I liked it,\nbut yeah, I think I got better and better at it. I mean, you know, as you're writing and they had creative\nwriting classes, you know, in prison at the low, you know,"

      "text": "the low was a much\ndifferent breed of animal, you know, like it, you know, it was, you could very easily get hurt. You could get hurt either place. But there were guys\nthat have life sentences that had been working out for 20 years and were just super angry,\nyou know, at the medium. And if you got hurt at the medium, it was probably really go bad, as opposed to you get hurt at the low, it's more like a fist\nfight in high school. So with knives. So anyway, so I'm there,\nI'm writing, I'm doing that. And there was a guy on the compound that came on the compound\nabout that same time. His name was Frank Amodeo. Frank Amodeo is a rapid cycling bipolar with features of schizophrenia - Rapid cycling, bipolar with\nfeatures of schizophrenia. - Schizophrenia,\n- Rapid cycling. - So it's just constant, right? And so there are moments\nin his manic state where his reoccurring psychosis, I guess is that he believes, and since he was in his\nearly teens, has believed that he is preordained by God\nto be emperor of the world. He's a lawyer. Disbarred, stole close to $200 million from the federal government. They gave him 22 years and\nthey sent him to Coleman. But it doesn't, this is the part I love. The delusions don't affect his legal work. It doesn't say a ton for legal community. But-\n- How do you know he's delusional? I'm just asking questions. - Yeah, he's, trust me,\nI mean, it's not me. It's like the transcripts, the lawyers, the doctors, you know. Yeah, there's a ton of, a ton.\n- All right. - And then if you saw him in action, you'd be like, \"Oh, wow.\" You know, he would be completely normal. He would be having a\ncompletely normal conversation, and somebody would say something and he would, he'd go,\n\"That makes me so angry. I can't, I'm not gonna let them do that. When my legions march on Washington, we are going to burn the constitution, and the president will kneel at my feet\" And he goes, \"I'm gonna need your transcripts. I'm gonna need a 2255 form. We're gonna file a,\" you\nknow, and it would just like, and everybody would sit there\nand be like, \"Okay, Frank, I'll get to this and\nI'll get,\" it was insane. It was the most insane. He was basically running\na medium-sized law firm from inside of the prison. He was training people. He taught the legal research class and was training people on\nhow to do legal research in prison, how to put together motions, how to fight, fight their\ncases, how to do the research, how to type them up, everything. He's teaching a law. It is just like a law school, right? Like he's teaching these guys, he, listen, they made such a mistake\nlocking this guy up. - So he is a great lawyer. - Listen, it's gonna get worse. It's gonna get worse. Because here's what\nhappens is at this point, I don't talk to him for\nprobably a year or so because everybody's saying\nhe's crazy, you know? And he's, and then for\nlike a year he gets there, he's drooling out of\nthe side of his mouth. They got him on a ton of medication. It takes him about a year to get them, to take him off the medication. So he gets them to take\nthem off the medication and then he starts kind\nof stabilizing his mood by drinking Pepsi. I know, bro, it's crazy,\nI know it's crazy. I know how, I see you looking at me like this guy's delusion. I know, but.\n- It works, whatever works. - So at some point, one\nof my buddies comes to me and says, \"Look, you\ngotta go talk to Frank.\" Well, here's the other thing. Over the course of a year or two that he starts doing legal work for guys, he starts just taking on guys' cases. \"I'll do the motion, I'll do\nyour legal work, I'll do this.\" Keeps him busy, but suddenly you start\nhearing people get released. You know, Jimmy just got 10\nyears knocked off his sentence. He's going to halfway house next month. You know, Tom got an immediate release. Frank's walking people up to\nR and D, shaking their hands. Guys are walking up to\nhim in tears, crying. And so, you know, crazy or not, what choice do I have? I called three different\nlawyers on the street and said, \"This is what\nhappened, what can I do? What can I do? They had me, they told me to\ndo this and this and this, and I worked with them, and then they decided not to proceed. And what can I do?\" And they said, \"You're hit, bro. There's nothing you can do. You cannot, in the middle,\nin the 11th circuit, you cannot force them to file\na reduction on your behalf. You cannot do it. It's impossible. You're hit, you're done. It's over. I'd love to take your money, Mr. Cox, but it's not gonna happen. I don't, I can't, I'm not\njust gonna take your money. You're gonna lose.\" Three different lawyers. I talked to, I or T.I.'s lawyer. Told me, \"Well, it's not\ngonna happen, it's over.\" So my buddy says, \"Go talk to Frank.\" I said, \"Well, why wouldn't I? I got nothing else to lose.\" So I go talk to Frank. He actually has a little manic moment, that little thing that I just showed you. That's exactly what he said\nthe first time I talked to him. - Based on your case.\n- Yes. \"I won't let this happen.\" He's like, \"I'm gonna\nneed your transcripts. I'm gonna need you to get this. I need to see your indictment. I'm gonna need your pre-sentence report. I'm gonna need.\" It's like, \"Okay.\" And\nI turned to my buddy. He's like, \"Bro, I know, I\nknow what you're thinking. It's fine.\" \"Fucking crazy.\" And he's like, he's like, \"I understand. Let just, what choice do you have?\" I was like, \"Fuck.\" So Frank files a 2255 motion on my behalf, stating that I'm not time barred that Millie was, we file it against Millie stating that she was ineffective, right? That she didn't understand the law. She had me plead to something, 'cause she thought I could get a reduction simply for doing \"Dateline.\" Oh, by the way, when I was in the medium, the government came to me and asked me to be interviewed by \"American Greed.\" I do that, I'm interviewed, you know, they get me on the phone. They talk to me, everything. The prosecutor wants me to\ndo it. She's re-interviewed. Everybody's re-interviewed. It airs, Millie goes to them, to the government, says,\n\"Look, reduce the sentence.\" They go, \"No, Millie, it's not enough.\" Then they come to me and they ask me to write an ethics and fraud course. I write an ethics and fraud course. The guy I write the\ncourse with, he flies up to Atlanta, he talks\nwith, I think he drove up, but he goes up to Atlanta, he talks with a US\nAttorney, talks to Millie. She insists, \"If he does this,\nI will reduce his sentence. I will definitely consider this.\" Definitely consider.\n- Yeah, definitely consider. - And then we do it. It's being used all over the nation. Not enough.\n- Considered, yeah. - So that's where, at\nthis point, I go to Frank. I tell Frank what's happening. Frank says, \"Yeah, this is,\" he goes, \"Every time they asked\nyou to do something, it reset the time bar. You have a year from that\ntime to file a 2255.\" Now, he insists that that\nwas a viable argument. Nobody else does. But he said, \"I'm not\ngonna let them do this. I'm gonna take care of this. I'm gonna get your sentence reduced.\" Okay, emperor. Okay, emperor.\n(Lex laughs) So he was a character. Anyway, so he files a 2255. The government comes back,\nthey say, \"He's time barred.\" Frank comes back, he you\nknow, they answer his motion. He files a retort. They file, you know, it\njust goes back and forth. This goes on for six months to a year. And at some point I go to mail call, and, you know, they call my name and they hand me this\nthing and I open it up and it says, \"The government's\nfiled a motion for a stay\" so that they can, they want the court to appoint me a lawyer and to discuss filing a rule 35, reducing my sentence. And, you know, I'm like, I read it, but I couldn't even understand. Like, well, I don't understand. So, I mean, I rushed to go find Frank. I show it to Frank and he says, \"Yeah, they're staying it,\nthey're gonna send you a lawyer and you're gonna negotiate for how much they're gonna\nreduce your sentence.\" He said, \"It's perfect.\" So they fly this woman down,\nher name was Esther Panitch. She flies down, comes\nto the visitation room, they bring me there, the lawyer's room, whatever they call it, and\nso we're sitting there, and I remember we're talking and she says, \"Listen, your, your motion, you're 2255, it's written well, but honestly, you don't\nhave much of a prayer. And they're offering you\na one level reduction, which is 30 months.\" And I went, \"Oh, that's,\nthat's not enough.\" And she said, \"Well, I don't\nknow what to tell you.\" She said, \"They're willing\nto bring you back.\" And I was like, \"Well, you know, I mean, I don't know,\nI gotta talk to Frank. Frank said I deserve this many levels.\" And, you know, we're going back and forth. She says, \"Who's Frank?\" And I go, \"Frank's the guy\nthat's doing all my legal work.\" She goes, \"He didn't write all this? And I was like, \"No.\"\nShe goes, \"Who wrote?\" And I explained it to her and she's like, \"He's an inmate?\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" And she's, \"Why is he here?\" And I tell her, \"Well, 'cause\nshe stole a bunch of money from the federal government, 'cause he's trying to\ntake over the world.\" So I tell her that whole thing. And she's like, \"You're\nletting a mentally incompetent, you know, person, do your legal work.\" And I was like, \"Yeah, because all the competent attorneys wouldn't do it.\" They said I didn't have a prayer. Your people said, I didn't have a prayer. And I said, \"Frank said he was gonna, he could get this done.\" And she's like, \"Well, I mean,\nyou know, you don't like, I don't even know why they're\noffering you one level.\" I was like, \"Well, Frank said,\" you know, and I'm like, \"Frank this, Frank that.\" And so she and I end\nup saying, she's like, \"You're taking advice from a\nlegally incompetent person.\" I said, \"Yeah.\" And she said, \"You know, you\nreally don't have a prayer.\" I said, \"Then why are you here?\" I said, \"If they could crush me so easily, why are you here?\" I said, \"They're giving me one level. Lemme talk to Frank, I'll let\nyou know what we're gonna do.\" So I leave, I call her\na couple days later. I tell her, Frank and I talked to Frank. Frank said, \"Go back, go\nback and argue for more.\" He said, \"I think the judge\nis gonna give you more. He's gonna give you at least, you know, between whatever he said,\" like six or seven levels or something. So I get moved all the\nway back to Atlanta. The FBI agent comes to talk on my behalf. The guy that, like multiple people show up to talk on my behalf. They say, you know, Millie, who I filed the 2255 against. So I'm basically saying,\n\"You're ineffective, you're incompetent,\" you\nknow, but she knows the game. She's like, \"I get it.\" She gets on the stand\nand testifies for me. So the judge goes, \"Eh, you know, listen,\" I think we were asking\nfor like nine levels or something outrageous. Prosecutor starts arguing for one level. And he said, \"Listen, one\nlevel is not nearly enough for what Mr. Cox has done.\" He said, \"Mr. Cox, I know you're arguing for nine levels off your sentence.\" He goes, \"That was never gonna happen.\" I was like, it felt like I got slapped. And he said, \"So I'm\ngonna go with six levels.\" No, no, I'm sorry. He said, three levels. \"I'm gonna go with three levels.\" He goes, \"Which is seven years.\" Which he said, \"For somebody\nwho has no arrest associated with his case, he said,\nI think it's pretty good. And that's my,\" that's his judgment and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he hammered, put the, puts\nthe gavel down and walks off. And that's it. It's over,\nI guess seven years. And I was hoping for more. So\nI get moved back to Coleman. I get moved back to Coleman\nand I go to up to Frank, and I said, Frank, I got seven years off. And he is like, \"I know, I know.\" I said, \"And I don't mean\nto sound unappreciative. I said, I just,\" I said,\n\"I was hoping for more.\" He goes, \"I was too.\" He said, \"It looks like we're gonna have to eat this elephant\none spoonful at a time.\" And he goes, \"Something will come out, something's gonna happen.\" He said, \"Keep your ears\nopen. Something will happen.\" And I said, \"Okay.\" And you know, I honestly, by that point, I'd done, you know, I'd done eight years and I remember like if I got a\nyear off for the drug program and good time and this,\nand I had about eight or eight years left to go or\nsomething, nine years left. And I was like, you know, I can do that. I'll write, you know, I'd been writing. By that point, I'd\nactually written a story. Like I got a book deal\nfor Diveroli, you know, and I ended up writing a synopsis of a guy's story. And I got him in \"Rolling Stone Magazine.\" And I got a book deal for that. Like, I got an advance,\nit was like 3,500 bucks for being in prison, a prisoner\nto get a 3,500 advance. Like I'm a millionaire.\nIt's a lot of money. So, and then we optioned the film rights. Basically the synopsis that\nI wrote for this reporter, journalist for \"Rolling Stone.\" He goes to \"Rolling\nStone\" with what I wrote and gives it to them and they okay it, they say, \"Yeah, this is great. We want you to write an\narticle based on this.\" Okay, he writes the article, he tells me that the article will be from him. His name, Guy Lawson. Douglas Dodd, which is the name of the kid I wrote the memoir about, and Matthew Cox. A couple of weeks before it's going, the article is going to be published, he tells me \"Rolling\nStone\" doesn't want my name on the article because\nI'm in federal prison and doesn't look good, but don't worry, he's gonna\nput my name in the article. And that's just as good. And\nI argue it's not just as good. It's not, I'm like, \"I would be a writer for 'Rolling Stone Magazine.' Like you understand, I'm trying\nto, I'm trying to come up with something here that\nI can rebuild my life as a true crime writer. That's no good.\" What the, and that wasn't so bad. That wasn't the worst of,\nthe worst of it was 90% of the article that he published was taken directly from what I sent him. Like, I mean, sick to my\nstomach, bro, just sick over it. So, but they option, they\noption the life rights for that. And I got a piece of that.\nSo there's like $7,000. I get a check for that. So I'm thrilled, I can keep writing. 'Cause you have to understand\nwriting on the computer there, they charge you. So I start write, oh, they\ncharge you for phone calls, writing, comma, every\nsingle thing costs money. So I start writing all\nthese guy's stories. I start writing books. I just come back from,\nwent back to Atlanta, got seven years knocked\noff my sentence, come back and I'm walking around the compound. Now, there was a guy that\nwas there named Ron Wilson. Ron Wilson ran in the, if\nyou look in the newspaper, it says it's like a hundred\nmillion dollar Ponzi scheme, but really it was $57 million. So he had lost 57 million. So it says a hundred, you know, they, you know, they always exaggerate. 'Cause 57's not enough. Ron ended up getting 19 and a half years. Ron was an old con man, early 60s, 62, 61, I don't know. And Ron, and I liked Ron. So we're walking around the compound and he's like, \"So what are you gonna do? I mean you got like eight\nor nine more years to go.\" And I was like, \"Eh, you\nknow, I'm gonna keep writing and when I get outta here,\nmaybe I'll have a huge body of work and maybe I'll be able to sell it. Or maybe I'll be able to\noption some more stuff. And if I could get together\nwith 'Rolling Stone' or get with some of these\nmagazines, I could start writing for them and I could option those. Maybe I could walk outta\nhere with something.\" So, \"Right, right, right.\" So Ron was, who'd only\nbeen locked up like a year or so, he was cooperating with the Secret Service in his case, against some of his co-defendants. So he's already been debriefed and he's cooperating, he's\nactually thinking he might get brought back to have\nto testify at a trial. We're talking and we're walking and he keeps saying, you know,\n\"Even if I, even if they, they charge those guys,\nand even if this happens, they're not gonna reduce my sentence. They're not gonna cut my sentence.\" And you know, first of all, well probably because you stole a bunch\nof money from pension funds and churches, that didn't help your case. But I don't say that. So I say, oh, they have to, bro, they'll have to, they've, you know, if you cooperate, they're gonna have to, and if they don't, we'll\nhave Frank file a 2255.\" And he's like, \"Ah, that crazy mother.\" So he says, \"Okay.\" He's like, \"Yeah, yeah,\nyou don't understand. You don't understand.\" So this goes on for months. And I'm like, \"What is the problem?\" And he says, \"You know, they think I hid Ponzi scheme money,\" you know, and he'd actually dug up like five or $6 million in Ponzi\nscheme proceeds that he dug. He'd buried in these-\n- Oh, literally. - Literally buried in\naluminum ammunition canisters. Super interesting guy. So he actually went and dug\nthem up and gave them to him. And I'm like, \"Well, you\ngave them all the money. It's, you didn't hide anything. Relax, it's not a big deal. They're not gonna find anything,\nso don't worry about it.\" And so he mentions it\na couple weeks later, a couple weeks later,\nand then one day I go, \"Bro, why do you keep bringing this up? Like, what are you concerned about? They're, it's not gonna happen.\" And he said, \"Can I trust you?\" And I went, \"Probably not.\" And he goes,\n(Matt laughs) \"I did hide some money.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" I said, \"You know, you\nbury it in a can somewhere? And he's like, \"No.\" He said, \"I gave my wife\nlike 150,000 in cash.\" I said, \"Okay, well she's\nnot gonna say anything she's using it.\" He said, \"No, you don't understand. Since then she found out\nI was having an affair and we're gonna get a\ndivorce and she hates me. And I think she'll turn that money in just to make sure that I\ndon't get a reduction.\" 'Cause if you lie to the\nFBI, they're not gonna, it doesn't matter what\nyou've done for them, they won't give you anything. And so he's, I'm sorry,\nit's Secret Service or anybody, he has clearly\nlied to the Secret Service at this point. If she goes and says,\n\"This is what he gave me.\" So he's like, I was like, \"Oh, wow.\" And he's like, \"And I gave\nmy, my brother's holding maybe 30,000 for me.\" And at that moment I was like,\nwow, like this poor guy. No, that's not what I thought at all. What I thought was, is that enough to get me a sentence reduction? - You son of a bitch.\n(Matt laughs) - And I went and I sat there and you know what I\nthought, I thought, I did, I thought, no, I thought,\nthat's not enough. That's not enough. It's nothing.\nThat's not even $200,000. Like, and they didn't want\nto give me a reduction. My prosecutor was pissed\nthat I got seven years off. She wanted me to get 30 months. She's not gonna give me\nanything. It's up to her. She's not gonna do it. So I go, I lay down, I go to bed. Like a month later I'm on\nthe phone with my lawyer, 'cause I had written,\nremember I wrote a man, I had a manuscript from my book, and I wanted to put some of\nthe stuff that was said at my, in my sentencing in the book. So I was trying to get my lawyer to mail me my transcripts\nand she hadn't done it. So I called her and I said,\n\"Listen, you said you're gonna,\" she's like, \"Oh God man, I'm so sorry. I'm so busy. I'll do it, I'll do it.\" And then she went, this is Esther. She goes, \"So what else\nis going on in there?\" And this, she never wanted to talk to me. Like she didn't, you know, when they were paying her,\nshe didn't want to talk to me. And I was like, \"What\ndo you mean? Nothing. I just need my transcripts and she's like, \"Nothing's happening? There's nothing you wanna talk about?\" And I was like, and I went,\n\"You know what? You know what? There's something weird\nhappened. Listen to this.\" And I told her about Ron Wilson. And she goes, \"Hold on. (Matt imitates typing) And she looks him up on the computer. She goes, \"Oh wow. This is a\nbad guy. This is a bad guy. And he told you, and you know where to?\" I said, \"Absolutely, and\nI can tell you exactly.\" And she goes, \"Okay, okay, okay.\" She goes, \"Let me look\ninto this.\" I go, \"Okay.\" So, a week later, a CO comes\nto me and goes, \"Hey Cox.\" And I go, \"What's up?\" He goes, \"Listen, at the next move,\" 'cause you know, they\nhave controlled moves. All the doors are locked and they open them up for 10 minutes. So you can run to the chow hall or you can run to the,\nyou can't run though. No running on the compound. But you can walk fast.\n- Move quickly, yeah. - Yes, to the rec yard\nor the library, whatever. He says, \"At the next move go to SIS.\" You know, so I go to SIS on the next move. But I was used to going there, by the way, because I was constantly ordering Freedom of Information Acts. And they would, so I'd\norder your, you're an inmate and I'd order, I'm\nwriting a story for you. And I'd order it and they'd send it to me. And then they would catch\nit and they'd be like, \"Why are you getting Lex's information?\" So they'd call me down there\nand I go, \"No, I ordered it for him and I'm writing a story. And I'd already been in\n\"Rolling Stone\" and everything. They're like, \"What's the story?\" And I tell them the story, they go, \"It's a pretty good story, here.\" And so I go down there,\nbut this is different. This, the guy answers the door and his guy, they call him Bulldog and he was a real asshole. He was a lieutenant at SIS and he's like, \"Come in here,\nget in here, Cox, sit down.\" And he dials the phone and he goes, \"Here, you\ngotta talk to this guy.\" And I'm like, \"What?\" And I pick up the phone,\nI'm like, \"Hello?\" And the guy goes, \"Hey,\nthis is Agent Griffin with the Secret Service. I understand, you know,\nwhere Ron Wilson is, has hidden Ponzi scheme money.\" I went, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I want something in writing. I want, you know, so I start\ndoing that and they go, \"Okay.\" Then I get his email address and we start emailing\neach other back and forth. And he ends up getting a\nletter from the US Attorney in South Carolina that says they will consider it\nsubstantial assistance if they make arrests or recover a substantial amount of money. That's the best I'm gonna get is consider. So I start talking to this guy and he starts asking me\nquestions about Ron Wilson. Like, \"Hey, ask him this, ask him this.\" So I'm like, \"Bro, I\ngotta kind of work that into a conversation, that's\nan odd thing to ask.\" So this goes on for six months. So I'm asking questions and\nI'm typing up little reports and I'm a prison snitch now. So I'm not just like cooperating, I'm now, I'm a prison snitch. So I've moved down, I've moved down actually from being just a cooperating witness or- - Because you're in prison? Is that what makes you a prison snitch? - Prison snitch. You can't even really say, no, you could say prison rat. You could say prison rat. I think prison snitch. I think that's probably\nthe closer to the term that most guys would use. - What's the difference between a snitch and a rat in prison? - I'm not sure. It rolls\noff the tongue better. Prison rat doesn't sound\nas good as prison snitch. I don't know, I don't spend a lot of\ntime thinking about this. So what happens is, I'm asking Wilson questions periodically, and at some point they contact me and they say, \"Listen, Wilson's\nabout to get some bad news.\" And I go, \"Okay.\" And they go, \"He's, you know, like, I wouldn't wanna tell you what it is. Let us know what happens.\" It's like two days go by and one day Wilson comes up to me one day and says, \"Cox, Cox.\" And I'm like, \"Oh shit.\" I'm like, \"Hey, what's up?\" You know? And he is like, \"Oh, you're\nnot gonna believe this. I got indicted.\" I was like, \"What? What happened?\" No!\" \"Yeah, my wife, they questioned my wife and my brother and my\nbrother, my wife walked in. First she said, 'I don't have nothing. I don't know what you're talking about.'\" The next day the brother\nwalks in and gives them $150,000 in cash. And so the next day the wife comes back and gives him $250,000 in cash and a bunch of silver, like gold bullion and silver, you know? 'Cause his Ponzi scheme\nwas based off of silver. You know, he was gonna\ninvest in silver for you. So half a million dollars,\nthey turn over half a million. I'm like, \"Half a million dollars? I thought you said it was\nlike 100,000 or something.\" And he's like, \"I know, I\ndidn't know I could trust you.\" I'm like, \"Ron, what are you doing? I thought we were.\" So, I'll tell you something just for the icing on\nthe cake, by the way. The icing on the cake. Lemme\nexplain one more thing. - Yep.\n- There's, so if you're gonna, if somebody cooperates with\nthe federal government, let's say I get arrested and they go, \"You want to help yourself?\" And you go, \"Yeah, okay, look, Jimmy is a, he lives next to me and\nhe's running a meth house,\" you know, a meth lab, whatever. And they go and they raid\nJimmy and he gets arrested. You're gonna get something off of that. Not a lot, but you're gonna get something. Now, and they could just say, \"We were gonna bust him anyway. We were already onto him,\" right? Now, the next level\nwould be you wear a wire. So I wore a wire and I was in danger. Now keep in mind, I'm\nasking this guy questions inside federal prison, I'm in danger. So whatever, that's like the next level. You're active, you're taking\nan active participation in the investigation. And the third level would be\nyou actually get on the stand and you cooperate and you testify. There's no better cooperation than that. So when Wilson says to me, \"They're gonna move me\nback to South Carolina, they've indicted me, they charged me, what do you think I should do?\" And I go, \"I think you\nshould go to trial,\" because I know they'll have\nto call me as a witness. Just to let you know, 'cause I don't, I don't want you to, I don't wanna walk outta here and have you feeling, feeling\nlike, hey, there's some, there's some good to this guy. - No.\n- So I'm ready, I'm ready to cut Wilson like a fish. - So.\n- Yeah. But you are putting yourself in danger if you get on the stand, right? - I'm already in danger. If people there heard what I was doing, I probably would've been in danger. - Does that increase the\nchance of them hearing or no? if you go to court.\n- It does, but it also increases my ability to get more off my sentence. So what happens is, a couple days later, he's on what's called the Packout, right? They're gonna move him maybe a week later. So they come and get him, they\nmove him, he gets back there to South Carolina and he pleads guilty. They sentence him, he\ngets six months added on. So he is now on from 19\nand a half to 20 years. And by the way, when COVID\nhit, he was released. So he only ended up doing like six years on a 20 year sentence\nbecause he was older. He's, by that point,\nhe's 66, 67 years old. You know, he's an old, anybody older than 55 was endangered, especially in the prison. So they had a COVID thing where they were releasing these guys and sending them home on ankle monitors. Like he's an old man, he's not,\nhe you, he's not gonna hurt. He's not a danger. So they sent him home. So he ended up doing, so he didn't even serve the six months. He didn't even serve the\noriginal sentence, whatever. Not that I care. So I'm just saying it makes\nyou feel like poor Ron, it's okay, so his wife got\nlike a hundred year a hundred. She got like a hundred\nhours of community service or something, or 60 hours. And I think his brother\ngot six months papers. So they got charged with\nobstruction of justice, you know, and they didn't,\nneither one of them, you know, just like six months probation and community service, nothing. So when we, I turn around,\nI'm waiting for my reduction, waiting, waiting. After about 90 days after this guy gets\nsentenced, maybe six months, I send a letter, \"Hey, what's going on?\" to the prosecutor, to my prosecutor, their the prosecutor, both\ndistricts, no response. Then I go to Frank, I explain to Frank and Frank has known what's\ngoing on the whole time. And Frank goes, \"Okay,\nI'm gonna file a 2255.\" So we file a 2255, government comes back and they, first thing\nthey say is, \"Your Honor, we don't know about any cooperation. We've never heard about any cooperation.\" So of course then we submit\nthe letter that we have. The judge comes back and the the judge ends up saying, \"It's a little complicated,\" but he ends up saying, \"Look,\nI don't have jurisdiction to hear this because\nyou may be time barred, but I'm gonna let the\nappeals court hear it.\" Now, typically you have\nto get what's called a, like a right of cert, a\ncertification to appeal. You have to make sure that\nyou actually have a case. He says, \"I'm waiving the cert and I'm waiving the $500\nfee to file with them.\" He said, he basically expedites it for me. Which is a subtle way of\ntelling the prosecutor, \"I think he's got something\nand I'm sending it up there.\" And the way he writes his motion, it's basically saying, \"I\ndon't have the jurisdiction to hear it, to do anything, but they do. They need to do it. And I'm paving the way. You don't have to pay any money and you don't need that cert.\" So the prosecution immediately comes back, they file a one level reduction. And we immediately, Frank\nfiles something saying, \"Hey, stop. We don't want the reduction. We don't want the one level.\nWe wanna come back to court. Please don't, don't rule on it.\" So the judge says, \"Okay,\nI'm freezing everything. I'm putting a stay on everything. I'm gonna give this guy a lawyer to try and figure out\nwhat you're gonna do.\" They fly down a lawyer, Leanne Weber. So she comes and she comes and sees me, and she says, \"Listen, I\nsee that you want to go back and fight this and this but honestly, I don't think you're gonna get\nanything more than one level. I talked to the prosecution. They said, they'll give\nyou,\" Well, she said, \"I can work on trying\nto get you two levels, but you don't have much of a prayer, you're gonna get crushed.\" And I said, \"Well then why are you here? If they can crush me so\neasy, why don't they do it? Why would they pay you?\" Like they pay them like 12 grand or something just to fly down and all your expenses to negotiate for me. Why not crush me? And she's like, \"I don't know.\" I said, \"Well, Frank said four levels.\" And she's like, \"Who's Frank?\" I go, \"Frank's the guy\nthat wrote all this.\" And she's like, \"Oh, is he an attorney?\" And I go, \"Is he in here?\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, he's in here.\" She's like, \"Why is he in here?\" And I tell her, he was\ntaking over the world. And she says, \"That's\nthe strangest thing I've ever heard my entire life.\" And I said, \"I understand. But Frank said,\" and she's\nlike, \"You're listening to an incompetent, you know?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, absolutely. And Frank said, four\nlevel, we want four levels. He said, for me to tell\nyou we want four levels.\" She goes, \"Okay.\" She leaves, she goes to the US Attorney, we argue two levels. They come back and say, two levels. No, we go back and forth. We start filing motions saying we want to go back, we want a hearing. We wanna bring back all the FBI agents, the Secret Service agents. And she's like, \"What? Do you wanna turn this into a circus?\" \"Exactly what do I wanna do, I'm gonna turn it into the biggest circus, 'cause I've already got one level.\" They come back one day, she says, \"Listen, three levels is the\nbest you're gonna get.\" She said, \"So I guess you'll be moved back here, we'll go to the hearing.\" I said, \"No, no, no,\nI'll take three levels.\" And she goes, \"What are you talking?\" She said, \"You said four levels. You said Frank wouldn't take, let you take anything less than four.\" I said, \"No, Frank said to tell you four. I was happy with three. I\nwanted you to argue for four. I'm good with three. I'm\noutta here in like a year.\" So, and I don't wanna be moved back. I don't wanna have to get on that bus, you know what it's like to be moved? It's horrible. So I said, \"I just want the three levels.\" So then we argue about\nthe wording for about two, three months, and then they file it. And then I get five years\nknocked off my sentence because three levels at this, at the level I was at\nnow isn't seven years. Every level you get a little less time. So I get five years off. So now I've got 12 years\nknocked off my sentence. At this point, I maybe have a year and a half to go. And, you know, that's doable. So I was super, super happy. And I'm gonna tell you something and I'm sorry, bro. But every time I think about it, and I just feel like I have to say it. Like Frank, I'm gonna go insane. But I can, like, I didn't have a fucking\nprayer without that guy. And as crazy as he is, and much of a pain in the ass as he was like, I could never repay him, bro. Like, I'm not, I shouldn't be here. I'm supposed to be in prison right now. My out date was 30, was 2030 without that guy. - Where is he now?\n- He got himself out. He didn't do all that\ntime. He got himself out. I don't even know how he did it. They've even threw him back\nin prison again for six months and he got himself out again. He's insane. He's incredible. He's insane, but he's incredible. - Is he really that insane? - He's in Orlando. - Is he, I mean, he seems like he seems like a good\nlawyer and a good man. - He, look, he's, he's,\nhe's great. He's great. I mean, there's no doubt in\nmy mind I would be in prison right now if it wasn't for him. - And he is done this for others? - Walk people right out, 10\nyears off, five years off, nine years off, 10 years. I mean, it's, I didn't pay and\nI didn't pay for one thing. I didn't pay for my stamps.\nHe paid for everything. - Sounds like the other lawyers don't really believe it's possible and he does. It's interesting. - Well, I think he's willing to, he's willing to badger\nthem into doing, you know, what they should have done to begin with. I actually wrote a book\nabout it, which he loved - About him.\n- About him and his story. His, it's so over the top\nwhat happened with him. I mean, literally tried\nto take over the Congo. I mean, there's a documentary about it. There's, it's called\n\"Nine Days In The Congo.\" It's an insane story. That's one of those\nstories that's just like, how is this not a movie? - It's not a movie yet?\n- No, I don't, I've pitched it several times and it'd be, it would be great. But, so I wrote a synopsis\nand I turned that into a book. - What's the name of the book? - Oh, \"It's Insanity.\" - \"It's Insanity.\"\n- Yeah. But about it, like a\nyear and a half later,"

      "text": "like, I ended up getting out of prison and I went to the halfway house. - What'd that feel like? Freedom. - I was, oh, this is bad, bro, this is bad. I remember when I was leaving the prison. So, you know, I met some\ngreat guys in prison, which is a weird thing to say, but I've met better, I met\nbetter people in prison than I'd ever met outside\nprison at that low. I mean, because it was the first time I actually had friends, you\nknow, like I really had someone that wanted to hang out\nwith me just to like, I didn't, I didn't have\nanything to offer them. I can't make you any money.\nI can't do anything for you. We're just hanging out\nbecause we like to laugh or we have things in common, or we are fascinated by each other, or we just have good time and fun. So when I was leaving, I\nremember my mom showed up and my brother showed\nup and they picked me up and we were driving off. And I remember looking back at the prison and my brother said, Paul, \"I'm glad, I'll bet you're\nglad to see that,\" you know, \"To leave that behind you.\" And I started crying. It's like nobody talked. I was so uncomfortable. It was, I started crying and it wasn't because I\nwas like, oh, it's over. It was because it was like\nsurvivor's guilt, you know? Like I was leaving all of my friends and I felt so bad that I was leaving them. But I went to the halfway\nhouse and I had four. So when I was getting\nout, I remember joking that I had exhausted my Trulincs account, my inmate account. I'd exhausted it. I had nothing. I had like 18 cents. I couldn't even figure\nout how to spend it. And they give you a debit\ncard when you leave. And I said, like, and they charge you every time you swipe, you use the card. Like, I don't even have\nenough to spend the 18 cents. You know, it's 'cause\nthe charge is like $3. So I was like, I was like, \"Yeah, yeah.\" I was like, \"I wonder if they're still giving me my debit card.\" And I'm laughing. Everybody's like, \"What\nare you going to eat? What are you this, what are that?\" And my one buddy looked\nat me, he was like, \"You can't go to the halfway\nhouse with nothing, bro.\" And I was like, \"No, it's cool.\" I said, \"No, it's cool, you\nknow?\" I said, \"No, it's cool.\" I said, \"I want to start at the bottom. I've got that coming. I got working at McDonald's, coming, so I'm gonna work at McDonald's. I don't give a fuck.\" And he was like, \"Well, I think I,\" he goes, \"I think you're\ngonna need to buy clothes. I think that's,\" said, \"Oh, it's so.\" I said, \"It's at the Goodwill.\" They'll give you a bunch of, they give you a bunch of crap\nif you don't have anything, if you're indigent. And I said, \"I'm indigent.\" And a couple days before I'm leaving, $400 ends up on my account. And I was like, what the fuck? And it was from a buddy of mine, and I go to him, my buddy Tommy, and I was like, \"Tommy,\" I go, \"Did you put $400 on my account?\" And he said, \"I can't let\nyou go with nothing, bro.\" So I get to the halfway\nhouse and I go to Walmart and I buy $300 worth\nof clothes at Walmart. I've never been in a Walmart. I go to a super Walmart, it's huge. And I go there and I\nbuy a bunch of clothes and I buy about 300\nbucks worth of clothes. And I still have some of the blue jeans, to this day I still wear\nsome of the blue jeans. And I stayed in the halfway house. And I called the buddy of mine named Treon, Treon Calta. And he owns a gym. And you know, I grew up\nwith him, his whole family. Like, they owned a bunch of gyms. And I called him and I said, \"Hey man,\nI'm in a halfway house.\" And he was like, \"Hey, what's going on?\" He said, \"Can I do anything for you?\" And I was like, \"I mean, I need a job.\" I didn't think he was gonna gimme a job. He goes, \"Bro, you're\nhired. I'll give you a job.\" He said, \"I can, minimum wage.\" I said, \"That's fine, if\nI can stay outta here,\" you can work like 80 hours a week. And I was like, \"If I can\njust stay outta here 80 hours and you pay me minimum wage,\" he goes, \"Oh, hell yeah, perfect.\" So I'm at the gym and I got free reign. So I'm playing on my\ncomputer goofing off all day. And my buddy, Pete, who's still locked up, he's texting me and calling me. And he is like, not texting me. Like he's emailing me\nthrough the CorrLinks system. And he calls me periodically. He's like, \"Have you started a website?\" 'Cause one of the things I was gonna do when I got out was I was\ngonna start a website with all these stories that I'd written. And I was like, \"No,\nPete, I don't, I can't, like, I don't have a computer.\" He's like, \"Well, how much is a computer?\" I was like, \"I don't know,\nthey're like 300 bucks.\" I was like, I don't, I said, \"I could probably get a\nused Apple like MacBook, like a five-year-old MacBook or something, I don't know, for like 3, 4, 300 $50, whatever.\" And I said, but he was like, \"Okay, so that's all you need, 300 bucks.\" I go, \"No, no, no, no.\" I\nsaid, \"It's not 300 bucks, bro. It's 300 bucks plus it's\ngetting a WordPress website,\" which I said costs money. Plus it's hiring somebody\nto help me figure it out because I don't, I'm inept. I don't know how anything works. So he, okay. And I said, \"Plus I need\nthis, plus I need this. I need a bunch of stuff.\nI need $600 for this. I need 300 for this. I need 500 for this. I need $1,000 for this.\" And he goes, \"Okay.\" He said, \"I'm gonna, I'll\nget you. Okay, I got it.\" So he reads off a list, he goes, \"I got you,\" but Pete\ndoesn't have any money. And I go, \"How are you\ngonna gimme any money?\" He goes, \"Every day I walk\nacross the compound some,\" he goes, \"People stop me\nand say, 'how's Cox doing?'\" And I say, \"Oh, he's okay.\" And they say, \"Does he need anything?\" And I say, \"No, no, he's good.\" He said, \"I'm gonna start\ntelling these fuckers yeah. Yeah, he needs something. You wanna do something for\nhim. Here's what he needs.\" I ended up getting two laptops sent to me. I got the computer program Final Cut Pro. I had guys in prison cutting me checks so that I could build a website and put all these stories on the website. So I start putting the website and I don't know what I'm doing, man. I mean, I put them on the website slowly. It takes forever. I'm putting pictures up. I'm trying to figure out how, you know, Photoshop works, how\nall this stuff, right? The whole time I was, I wanted to start, 'cause everybody, the last one, I was just getting outta prison. Everybody kept telling me like, \"Bro, you gotta start a podcast. You gotta start a true crime podcast.\" And I don't know what a podcast is. The term podcast came\ninto existence in 2009 when I'd been locked up three years. I'd never been on YouTube.\n- Yeah. - So by the time I get out the last year or two guys are coming up\nto me giving me magazines. \"Like, this is what a\npod you need to read, Look true crime's huge. And you got the thing, guys\nare asking me every couple of days, \"Cox, you got any stories?\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, yeah.\nDid you read 'Cash And Coke?'\" And they're like, \"Is that the one where the guys are\nrobbing the drug dealer?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Oh no, no. I read that one.\" \"Did you read this one?\" \"No, no, no, I haven't read that. That's the one with\nthe guy,\" and I'm like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\" So I mean, so I'm giving\nthese little stories and then they'd come\nback and give them to me. You know, it's, you don't have, you don't have anything in there, right? So this is guys that would never read in\ntheir life are reading. And I'm writing about the guy in B2, the guy in C1. So I put up the whole thing and they're, well anyway, they're all telling me\ndo a true crime podcast. true crime podcast, I don't\nreally know what that is, but by now I'm starting to\nlisten to them on YouTube, you know, serial and cold case files, you know, that kind of stuff. And I think that's what I want to do. Well, my buddy Treon says,\n\"There's a guy named Danny Jones that runs a podcast called 'Concrete,' and it's in St. Petersburg and he lives a couple miles from me. I see him all the time.\" And I went, \"Okay.\" And he said, \"You should email him. He's got a guy on there all\nthe time that does real estate. And I go, I just got outta prison for bank fraud related to real estate. He doesn't wanna interview me.\" He goes, \"Well, you could, maybe he does, maybe you could ask him\nabout starting a podcast.\" Okay. So I sent him an email. I remember Danny called me and he said, \"Hey, is this Matt Cox?\" I was like, \"Yeah, this is Matt.\" He's like, \"I got your email. This is Danny Jones.\" And I was like, okay. And he says, \"Yeah, I\ngot your email, bro.\" He goes, \"This is a good fucking email.\" I was like, \"What?\" He goes, \"I get a lot of emails, bro.\" He said, \"That is a-\"\n- It's a good one. - \"That's a good one.\" He said, \"That was really good. Like, I mean, that was well written.\" He's like, \"Like I immediately\nknew I had to talk to you.\" And I said, \"Oh, okay.\" I said, 'cause you know, I start off with, I think I started off with,\n\"Hey, my name's Matt Cox and I'm a conman.\" - Good opening.\n- \"I was recently released from federal prison.\" And so he was like, \"Oh yeah,\nI mean, who, who says that?\" So anyway, he said,\n\"Well, what's going on?\" I said, \"Well,\" and I\ntell him what's going on? I wanna start a podcast, blah, blah, blah. And you know, Danny, he\nlistens to me for 30 minutes to an hour and I've heard\nthis and this and that. He's like, \"Yeah, right.\" He's, \"You know, YouTube's\nnot really like that. And that's not really how we do it. And you know, I don't know that you're, you're gonna have to get\na production company,\" and blah, blah, blah. He goes, \"But you know what? What you really need to do is to see if people are even\ninterested in you or your story, or you're able to talk. You should come on my show.\" You know, shameless.\n- Yeah. - Trying to get some content. - Well, I mean, so as I\ntold you, offline, Danny and \"Concrete Podcast\" is really good. So people should definitely listen to it. - Yeah.\n- But yeah, I mean, it turns out people do\nlike listening to you. - Turns out.\n- I mean, you're good at, telling stories.\n- Well, anyway, by the time I got, I\ncouldn't do Danny's podcast. I was like, \"I can't do it,\nbro. I'm in the halfway house,\" so maybe I get outta the halfway house and a couple months go by. Just maybe two months, three months go by. And one day I get a phone call from Danny. He's like, \"Bro, you're outta\nthe halfway house, right?\" And I was like, 'cause I\ntold him I got out in July, it was like October, November. I'm like, \"Right.\" He's like, \"Listen, I\nhad a guest fall through. I got nobody. I need you to come on. I answered all your questions,\nyou know, I'd call them five, six times, you know, and you said.\" And I was like, \"Ah.\" I was like, \"I'll, fuck it, I'll do it.\" That video got like a 2 million views. Then I did Patrick Bet-David flew me out. Then I did Soft White\nUnderbelly, you know, then I did Vlad, then I did all, like, people started, and I'm sorry. And then, you know, it just blew up. And then people started asking me to come and, you know, talk for no\nreason for, which was crazy. But you were saying, I'm sorry."

Yeah, he came to see me\nlike two or three times. - When is the first time he found out that you were doing fraud? - The first time I got in trouble. - When you got the probation?\n- Yeah, because I had, you know, I had to kind of explain that, you know, like something's happening. I didn't want him to\nhear from anybody else. - So you talked to him directly about it. - Super disappointed.\n- Did he ever tell you he loves you after that? - So after I got the 26 years and the government\ndecided they weren't going to indict anybody, and I really\nwas like, wow, this is it. Like, you're done. He came to see me, but just by himself. And I remember he, I remember\nwhen he came to see me, I, you know, he was by, he was by himself. Like he never came by himself. So I remember thinking my mom,\nsomething happened to my mom and like, as soon as I walked\nin, you know, he walked in. I, what hap, I go, \"Where's mom?\" And he goes, \"Oh no,\nshe's fine, she's fine.\" And he sat down with me and he said. and he said, \"How are you doing?\" I was like, \"I'm good.\" And he was just like, you\nknow, he was getting sick, he was getting older. So, you know, we talked for a little bit just about the situation. And I was like, \"Yeah, I mean,\" he's like, \"Well, what are you gonna do?\" And I was like, you know,\n\"There's nothing I can do. Like everybody, I've\ncalled multiple attorneys. I've talked to people,\nthere's nothing I can do.\" And he was like, you know, \"We are gonna, you're\ngonna figure it out.\" You know, he goes, he said, \"You're clever and you're smart and you're gonna, you're not\ngonna do all of that time.\" And I was like, \"I'm done. It's over. I'm gonna get outta here when\nI'm 60 if I behave myself. And if I don't, I'll be 64.\" And he was like, \"That's\nnot gonna happen.\" And, so he said, I think that\nwas the first time he, you know, I knew he was proud of me when I was making\nmoney, but he never said it. You know, you got the look\nlike he was like impressed. But we were sitting there and\nhe said, I remember he said, 'cause it's the only time I can ever remember him saying\nhe was proud of me. And I remember he said,\n\"You're gonna figure this out.\" He said, \"I'm not proud\nof where you ended up, but you've done amazing things. You know, I wish you'd use your talents for something different,\nbut you've done things that I could have never done. And you've led an amazing, adventurous life and I'm proud of you.\" And that, you know.\n- I wish he could see you now. - My mom, I know my mom saw me. My mom's funny, 'cause\nmy mom came to see me. My mom's a gangster. My mom came to see me every\ntwo weeks for 13 years. She missed about a month and\na half when she had a stroke and ended up in a wheelchair. And then she came in the wheelchair and she would make my brother bring her. My brother and sister would be like, \"Mom, are you sure you want to go? Like, you know, it's so hard to, it's such a long drive\nand you get so tired.\" \"Well, I'll sleep in the car.\" \"I know, but you know, then you, we have to wait in that, the, you know, in that the waiting\narea, you know, forever. And it takes forever.\" \"Well, I'm in the\nwheelchair, so I'm fine.\" \"Well, I know, but it's such a pain to get in and out and then in and out.\" And she goes like, she goes, \"I'm going to see my son\nand you're taking me.\" - I love it.\n- She, yeah, so I. So she, yeah, she was,\nshe was something else. And I always say, you know, like if I had to say. You know, I don't think about all the things I did to get out. Like I know, you know, there's\nall these guys that are, you know, like, you know, \"Oh,\nI wouldn't have done that. I'd have been a standup guy and I'd have been,\" well,\ngood for fucking you, bro. I wanted to get out. I wanted out. And the icing on the\ncake of me getting out and I would've cut every\nmotherfucker's head in that prison off. I was able to get out just in time to spend the last year and a half of my mother's life with her. I saw her two or three times a week, took her to dinner once a week, was able to walk, go on walks\nwith her in her wheelchair. I was sitting right next to her when she had her final stroke. to her when she had her final stroke. I held her hand when she took her last breath. I don't give a fuck. I don't give a."

Yeah, I'd scrap all this to be, you know, you always hear these guys\nsay, \"I wouldn't change it because it made me the man I am today.\" The man I am today is a\nfucking 54-year-old scumbag, multiple felons, starting\nmy life over broke, you know, living off of scraps, you know, trying to make YouTube work. Like, you know, I've got, you know, two dead parents. I'm divorced, I have a son\nthat doesn't talk to me. I have a son that doesn't\ntalk to me for good reason, not because of a misunderstanding, because he understands. Like you can't even argue with him. He's got a powerful argument. Like, I don't wanna be a\npart of this guy's life. He's a scumbag. He stole money. He went on the run. He abandoned me when I was,\nyou know, three years old. I don't want anything to do with him. Like, I get it. Like I, you know, and I tried\nto do all the right things, you know, I wrote the\nletters, I drew him pictures. I've tried to call and it's not happening. Like, I would do anything to go back and just be that regular middle class guy with the two kids and the\nwife working a regular job. You know, like, that's a good life. You know, those are, that's a good person. And you know, I just made one arrogant\ndecision after another, after another until it snowballed and I couldn't take it back. And then I did everything I could. And if I wasn't the calculating, backstabbing scumbag\nmotherfucker that I can be, I'd be in prison right now. Sorry. You know? So, yeah. Yeah. I would much rather be a CPA right now. I would much rather, you\nknow, should have stuck with being an insurance\nadjuster or something. I mean, you know, I\nnever should have whited that 30 day late out. Never. It was a mistake. - That was your first mistake. - That was a huge mistake. - You think your son will forgive you? - No. Unfortunately, according to my ex-wife and my sister and everybody that he is a part of their lives. You know, and I've seen him, you know, my mother's funeral, I saw him, you know, I've seen him\nat several functions. You look across and he\nlooks right through me. I think that he's a, everybody\nsays, \"He's just like you. He's just like you.\" And everybody says, I'm just like my dad. I've never smoked a cigarette.\nI've never drank alcohol. Not a drop. Never done any drugs because my dad was an alcoholic and my dad smoked two packs a day and everything in our\nhouse reeked of nicotine. And I've never smoked. And\nmy dad was a pill head. He was always on some kind\nof prescription medication. He was draw, you know,\nand I didn't want to, I don't want to, I didn't\nwanna be that person. And like one day I drew a line in the sand and I wouldn't do it. And I think he's drawn a line in the sand and he's decided, you know, this is the hill I'm gonna die on. And I'm not gonna back off it. And the thing is, my ex-wife tells him, \"This, he's a good person. You should be in his life.\" His father, 'cause he was\nadopted when I was in prison. They adopted him. Nick is\nhis, you know, his dad. Nick has told him. Nick came to see me when I was in prison. You know, Nick has told him like, \"Hey, you, this is a mistake. You're making a mistake.\" Nick, everybody that knows me knows him. And he said, he has said no. So I fully believe it's no,\nI mean, I hope it's not. - Well, I hope he forgives you. I think there's a lot of good in you, despite you calling yourself a scumbag over and over in this podcast. - That keeps bothering you.\nYou mentioned that earlier. - What advice would you\ngive to young people given that you've lived quite\na non-standard life? What advice would you give them how to live a life they can be proud of? - I mean, I don't know if I'm in a position to, that anybody would listen\nto me, but I 'cause to me, and I don't have any advice that I don't think a\nfather would give you. And it's like, work hard, be appreciative. I mean, things are so good out here. I hear people complain all the time. And I think a huge part of just being happy is being appreciative. Like, I didn't appreciate anything. When I had, this is so cliche, but when I had all the money\nin the world, I was miserable. But when I got out with\nnothing, I was happier in prison with nothing than I was with two or $3 million prior to prison and driving, dating a chick I never\nshould have been dating, driving a sports car, vacationing all over the world, miserable. I'm crying, driving away from prison because I already miss my friends. Now you could have never told\nme that was gonna happen. - Turns out money, in fact\ndoes not buy happiness. - No, and I know, and it,\nit is such a cliche, right? But it's so true. - Crying, driving away from prison. Yeah. - You know what? I met my wife in the halfway house, so she had just gotten outta prison. She was in the halfway house with me. She just did five years\nfor like a meth conspiracy. I never would've met her\nif I didn't go to prison. You know?\n- And now your date night is hunting alligators together. - Yeah, that was like a month or so ago. - This is Florida, folks. This what, this is what, this is what badass people do in Florida. - My wife-\n- Hog hunting. - Is a former, she used to, so she was an MP in the military. She was, she did, she hunted, she ran a hog hunting tour guide service for six years.\n- Right. Yeah. - Went to prison for five years, got out, and then, you know, now\nshe's a marine mechanic. And yeah, our date night,\nthe other night was, we went in the middle of the night, went to Lake Okeechobee and went hog, went to alligator hunting. - Yeah, and if I may say\nso, she's quite beautiful. - Thank you. And I did, I did nice. She didn't wanna date me\nin the halfway house too. I kept saying, \"I feel\nlike you're sweet on me.\" She's like, \"I'm not, I'm not. I make fun of guys like\nyou. You're a city boy.\" I'm like, \"I don't know. I feel like- - Well, you wore her down. - That's what exactly what I did. - Yeah. It's that\ncharisma. It always works. Well, Matt, thank you for being so honest. Thank you for being who you are. I do think there's a lot of good in you.

And so we have this conversation and I tell her, \"Look,\npeople are looking for me.\" \"Who?\" \"Law enforcement.\" \"Which ones?\" \"All of them,\" you know? She's like, \"That doesn't even, for what?\" I go, \"Mostly bank fraud.\" And she's like, \"Well, how\nare they not finding you?

He has admitted guilt to all of it. He has written true crime stories of many of his fellow prisoners. And now he continues this work by interviewing criminals\nabout their crimes on his YouTube channel\nthat I recommend called, \"Inside True Crime.\" Exploring the mind of a criminal\nis exploring human nature at the extremes, often in its most raw and illuminating form. And that is something\nI definitely want to do with this podcast, to\nunderstand the human mind and everything it is capable of. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please\ncheck out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Matthew Cox. What was the first crime you committed? - The first mortgage I ever did. - [Lex] A mortgage is me\nborrowing money from a bank to buy a house.\n- Yeah. - How can you find a way\nto commit crime in this? How can you do fraud in this space? - It's very difficult for the average guy to commit fraud because there's\nso many safeguards set up. You know, if you were to go in and say, \"I make $300,000 a year.\" \"Okay, well, we want your\nW-2s, we want your pay stubs. We're gonna call your employer. We're gonna check to\nmake sure your employer, how long they've been incorporated. We're gonna check to make\nsure they're registered. We're gonna,\" it's like, ugh,\nyour whole plan fell apart. You know, because the\naverage guy can't do that. He can't even come up with\nthe, with the pay stub and W-2. So the average person, you know, or I'm gonna put down this much money, but you're gonna borrow that money from the seller, you know? Okay, well then they start\nasking for bank statements. Where did the money come from? How long has it been in your bank? Like, you can't even have it\nput in your bank for a day, get a letter, you know, it's gotta have been there\nfor 90 days or 60 days, depending on the bank. And so there's all these ways for the average person, it's\nvery difficult to commit fraud. The average guy that works at Walmart and makes $60,000 a year, and he is been there for five years and he saved his deposit. Like it's a very, that's really the guy that those transactions are set up for, to borrow a mortgage from Bank of America. That's the guy they're looking for. - So to commit fraud in this space, you have to misrepresent\nsome aspect of your identity of how much you're worth,\nhow much money you have, this kind of stuff. - Right, you have to be\nable to lie to the bank. Anytime you lie to the bank,\nyou've committed fraud. And it's funny, when I was, you\nknow, doing it, I would say, \"Ah, it's in the gray area.\" There's no gray area. You're either lying in some\ncapacity or you're not. So it's it, for instance,\nthe very first loan I did, I Wited-Out, my borrower had been 30\ndays late on her rent. So they're really looking\nat the last two years. So when you go into the bank, and they, most of what they're asking is a a two year window. They're saying, \"How long\nhave you been on their job?\" They care about two years. And how long have you\nbeen at your residency? They're looking for two years. Now, you could be at three\nplaces in two years. That's fine. As long as you consistently\npaid for two years. Well, she had been in\nan apartment complex, but she'd been 30 days late. Now she caught it up, but she was late. Bank, you know, the bank\ndoesn't want to lend you money if you've been 30 days late. So I was a broker and I\nWited-Out the 30 day late. I just got rid of it. And my manager is the person\nthat told me to do it. She said, \"It'll be fine.\" And she was right. It was. - What did it feel like? So that was the first\nfraudulent action you committed? - Yeah, I mean, you know, I was worried, you know, I always say, you\nknow, I sweated bullets for, you know, four or five days, you know, but I mean, I was concerned and I don't know that I was concerned that I had broken the law. I was concerned because I was\nbehind on my truck payment. I was behind on my mortgage. Like I had banked on\nbeing a mortgage broker. And I'd gone deep, deep behind\non all my bills to do this. So in the last minute, when\nthis loan isn't gonna close, and I have to commit\nfraud to make that happen. And the idea, my fear was\nthey were gonna figure it out and maybe I'd get fired. You know, I didn't think\nI was gonna go to jail because my manager assured\nme, you're not going to jail. Like, you'll get fired at best. So my concern was they\nwere gonna catch it, and I get fired and I wouldn't get paid. Like, I needed that money so bad. - So we'll maybe paint the picture here. Where were you working?\nWho was the manager? - The manager was, it's funny, 'cause I don't think I\never really mentioned this, her name was Gretchen Zayas. She eventually, I don't mind saying it, but she eventually got, ended\nup going to jail for fraud. Her name was Gretchen Zayas,\nand she was a manager. I was working for a company\ncalled Eagle Lending, and it was in Tampa. And this was like my first month. So it was my very first deal, three or four weeks into it,\ninto that first month. And I walk in, I put the\nfile in front of my manager. She looks through everything, you know. \"Oh, great, good, good.\" And put this one piece of\npaper over here and sat there. And then when she was done,\nI said, \"What's going on?\" She goes, \"Perfect, file's perfect.\" She goes, \"But your borrower\nwas 30 day late on her rent.\" And she says, \"That's, it's done.\" She's like, \"That's a deal killer.\" And I was like, \"Oh my gosh,\nyou know, what do I do?\" And I remember she pulled\nout a thing of Wite-Out, remember Wite-Out? Not\nthe sticks with the one. (Matt imitates scribbling) And she started going.\n(Matt imitates scribbling) And I was like, \"What?\" She goes, \"If I was you,\"\nand she handed, she said, \"I'd Wite it Out, make a copy,\nstick it back in the file.\" - Yeah.\n- She said, \"It'll be fine.\" And I went, \"I could,\" I\nwas like, that's fraud. I could go to jail.\" And she goes, and she was like, \"They're never gonna catch it.\" She said, \"Look, we do stuff,\nI do stuff all the time.\" She said, \"They're not gonna catch it, and nobody's calling the FBI.\" She goes, \"The worst case scenario, if underwriting catches\nit, then they'll fire you. That's it. Nobody's calling,\nyou're not gonna jail.\" And I was, you know, and I trusted her. I was like, \"Okay.\" And so, I did what she said.\nI stuck it in the file. And I mean, look, like I\nsaid, for four or five days, I was like, \"Oh my God,\nmy God, I'm so scared.\" - How old were you at this point? - Probably 29. I think it was 29. You know, like I had gone to college and so many things had not worked out. You know, I got a degree in fine arts. It's not a, there's not\na lot of people looking for anyone with a fine arts degree. And, you know, I tried to\nbe an insurance adjuster. Tried that for about a\nyear, year and a half. That didn't work out. Ended up working\nconstruction for a few years. And, you know, so finally\nthe girl I was dating said, \"You gotta be a mortgage broker.\" You know, she's just had just started as a mortgage in the mortgage industry. And she was like, \"You have to do this. Like, you were born to do\nthis. This is perfect for you.\" - What did she see in you? - She said, \"It just, you're a salesman.\" And I was like, 'cause\nI was like, you know, I barely balance my checkbook. Like, I don't know anything about numbers. And she's like, \"It has nothing\nto do with that. It's sales. It's putting together deals,\nyou know, you're good at that, you're good at negotiating. You're, you know, you're\na natural salesman.\" And I figured I'd, I\nneeded to try something. - So what aspect of mortgages\nis sales and deal making, what aspects require the\ncharisma that you clearly have? - Well, one, you've got, you have clients that have lots of options. They can go to Bank of America,\nthey can go to SunTrust, they can go to Chase. They have options if\nthey have perfect credit. I ended up working for a company\nthat was a subprime lender. And those people didn't\nhave a lot of options. By the time, honestly, by\nthe time they got to that, to Eagle Lending, their options were over. So what ends up happening is, you're negotiating with sellers. You know, you would think\nthat a lot of the stuff that in that industry that real\nestate agents should do, you know, the brokers end up doing because real estate agents are used to, you meet them at the house or they take you to several\nhouses, they, you know, they open the door, they walk around, they write up a contract\nthat's legit, a legit contract. And you're already pre-approved. Everything works out. But\nsubprime, that's not the case. You got borrowers with\nhorrific job history. They don't have enough\nof the down payment. They can't, maybe they\nhave the down payment, but they don't have the closing costs. So you have to go to the real estate agent and say, \"Listen, I need you\nto raise the purchase price,\" and have the seller pay the closing costs, which is legal, but\nthat's not, to a degree. But that's not how they\nwrote up the contract. So now you're having to get\nthem to rewrite the contract or you're have, you're, you know, there's little things you're trying to do. And the more, the more deals you get done, and the more you deal with\ncertain real estate agents, the more you start to\nrealize that they're, you know, you know which\nones are completely above board and which ones are\nwilling to twist the rules. - And a lot of it works\non personal relationships. - Right, right. For some reason, people tend\nto like me and trust me. - Yeah.\n- I don't know why, it hasn't worked out for so many people, but people naturally seem to trust me. And so if I say, \"Hey,\nI can close the loan, but you gotta do this, it'll be cool. Don't worry. We do it all the time. It's like my third loan. And you know, I've been\ndoing this for years.\" And they go, \"Oh, okay.\" And then they raise the purchase\nprice, they add some money, they have the seller of\nthe house give the borrower some money, they stick it in the bank, or they put it in escrow\nat the closing company. Like, now you're starting\nto massage deals. - What was the second time\nyou committed a crime? So what, how did it start\nto evolve from the Wite-Out? - Well, I mean, when that\nwent through, you know, I think a normal person\nprobably would've said, \"Wow, it was a one time\nthing, got away with it, whew, I'm good.\" But for me, it just emboldened me. Like, I just got a check for like, I don't know what it was, 25, $3,500. I was thrilled. And by that time I was already\nworking on another deal. But that guy, he made, I forget something\nlike he had made like, let's say $45,000 the\nyear before in his W-2, if you, based on his current track record or his year to date of his pay stub, he made just enough money. But if you factored in last\nyear's W-2, he was shy. So if I changed that 45,000 to 51,000, then he could, the loan closes, I get a check for 3,500 bucks. He gets into a house,\nI'm doing him a favor, you know, I'm doing God's work. So I fix it, I kick back. I'm terrified a little bit,\nyou know, worried about it. Sure enough, it closes. Four or five days later they\ncall me, he's ready to close. A week later, we close, I get a check. Next guy that comes in. I mean, I got very, very quickly, I was concerned, do you have a house? Do you have a deal? Is it ready? I can get you, I could get you done. Now if you were in\nbankruptcy or something, there's some things you\njust, you'd pull their credit and you just couldn't help them. If they were, if they\nhad a 550 credit score or something, and no job. I mean, you know, it\nhad to be within reason, but very quickly it was changing W-2s, changing pay subs, changing\nappraisals, you know, fixing, like I said,\nverifications of rent. So it evolved very quickly for me. - And you're essentially helping people. - That's what I told myself. - Giving them a chance. People that have been really\nstruggling financially in life. So you've been telling\nyourself that this is, you're doing a good thing for people. - I told myself that right up until that, those loans were solid and I was helping those people out right up until I went to prison. And I was in prison and I had to write,\nthe government asked me to write an ethics and fraud course to help teach the\nnation's mortgage brokers. You know, all loan officers and brokers have to take,\nI think it's nine hours of continuing education every single year. And I was approached to\nwrite the ethics course, and it was about that time and about the same period of\ntime I was writing a book, my book, and that kind\nof, I started reflecting on what I had done, you know? And the truth is like, and this\nis a horrible thing to say, 'cause the first time I ever\nheard somebody say this, I remember thinking, oh,\nthat's a horrible thing to say. Some people should not own a house. They shouldn't be allowed to borrow. They're not in a position\nfinancially, you know, and there were many occasions where I put someone in a house that they 100% swore they could afford. It was I was helping them. I told myself I was helping them. And a year and a half later,\nthey're going into foreclosure. Their stuff's on the corner,\nthey don't know where to go. And the truth is, is that I'm not smarter than the actuaries that came up with those underwriting guidelines. - So in this whole process,\nhow are you making money? Are you taking a percentage?\n- Broker fee. Yeah, I charge a broker fee.\nOr you charge yield spread. So yield spread is, let's say the interest\nrate is 8% interest. If I charge them 25\nbasis points over the 8%, so I charge them eight and a quarter, you know, 8.25, then I get\n1% of the loan back as a fee. So if I charge them\neight and a half percent, I get two points back. So if it's $100,000 piece of property and the bank says your\ninterest rate is gonna be 8%, and I tell you 8.5, and I'm charging you a $3,500 broker fee, now I'm making $5,500. So on even $100,000 loan, you could make a nice chunk of change. I mean, it's- - So how much gray area is here? You said that there really\nisn't when you're lying or not, but it feels like there is.\n- I mean, you're lying. But it, well, every\ntime I change something, it wasn't gray area, I just committed. - Right.\n- I just committed fraud. At this level, you're either,\nyou either meet the guidelines or someone has massaged it in such a way that they've committed\nfraud and that's it. And there's, now there's tons of ways where you can commit fraud and they just can't figure it out. Does that make sense? Like I mean, I've com\nyou've committed fraud and it's like they've\nlooked at the entire, they look at all the documents and they double check everything. And they know there's fraud in here, they just can't find it. - But just because they can't find it doesn't mean it's not fraud\n- Doesn't mean it wasn't, exactly, doesn't mean it wasn't fraud. - As part of this, you did\na lot of fascinating things. One of the things you did,\nyou talked about creating synthetic people, meaning\ncreating fake identities. What does it take to do\nthat, to do that well? - So your credit profile is\nmade up of your, you know, your name, date of birth, your address, and you know, your Social Security number. And, you know, those are\nthe kind of, you know, and then there's other things, where you work, that sort of thing. But what people don't realize is there's so many people out there that think that the credit bureaus already\nknow who you are, right? But the truth is, the first\ntime the credit bureau has ever heard about you\nwas when you told them. The first time you\napplied for a credit card, they created a credit\nprofile at that moment. Prior to that, they had no idea. So the first time you apply,\nyou give them your full name, date of birth, Social Security number and your address, and they\ncreate a credit profile and they say, \"Hey, no\nrecord found of this person. He has no credit,\" nothing\nprobably got denied. Well, what I realized\nthrough the course of, 'cause eventually I ended\nup leaving that one company and I opened my own mortgage company. When I opened that mortgage company, I was on the inside. Does that make sense? Like I wasn't just a\nbroker that was sitting out with everybody else and\nwould periodically come in and ask questions or would\ncall underwriting and, but really didn't understand\nwhat was happening and what exactly what the\nunderwriting guidelines were. Now, I was actually\ntalking to the underwriters and you're talking to the owners of the lending institutions and the banks, and you're talking to all\nof the account executives. And now it wasn't just Eagle\nLending I was talking to, there were 40 different\naccount executives coming in on a weekly basis trying\nto get us to sign up with their lender. And they're on the inside\ntelling you, coming in, showing you programs and saying, \"Look, if your\nborrower is, you know, self-employed, we don't\nask for this or this. We just ask for them to\nsay they're self-employed.\" Like liar loans, you've\nheard the term liar loans? - No.\n- Okay. No doc loans, where they don't\nask for any documentation. If he's got over like,\nlet's say a 700 credit score and he says he's been a plumber and he works for himself, then he's got over a 700 credit score. He just has to say he is worked for himself for over two years and- - They don't ask him any-\n- They don't ask for any documentation. He's got the money in the bank,\nhe's got a 700 credit score, says he is been on the job for two years, he's self-employed, we're gonna raise his interest rate by 1%. And he's got, you know, and that's it. He's got the loan. So, but you start to know how things work because I hired a bunch of\nbrokers to work underneath me, and when they would get caught,\nI would get the phone call. So I get the phone call\nfrom the owner of a banker or a lending institute,\nyou know, a lender. And that lender says, \"Hey\nMatt, we got a problem.\" I'm like, \"What's up?\" He is like, \"Listen, we\ncaught a, a fake W-2.\" I'm like, \"What do you mean?\" \"Yeah, your broker\nso-and-so sent us a file and this person had, there's two fake W-2s and we're assuming the\npay stubs are fake.\" And I'm like, \"Are you serious?\" How did you even catch that?\" And they go, \"Oh, well here's what we did. We checked with sunbiz.com,\nyou know, sunbiz.gov, which is the Secretary of State's website that registers corporations. And we checked and the tax\nID number didn't match.\" And now I know every W-2 has to have a matching tax ID number for whatever corporation issued it. - So, there's a sequence of\nchecks they do to detect fraud on different documents like W-2s. - Right.\n- And then you're slowly learning.\n- Slowly, yeah, exactly. - [Lex] What's the process for detecting? - I mean, I had a pretty\ngood understanding anyway. - Yeah.\n- But, so I'm starting to learn that-\n- It's common sense understanding, yeah.\n- So I'm putting these things together and I remember one time\nI had a woman come in and she came in and\nshe had perfect credit. She had like 750 credit\nscores. I mean, it was perfect. And she came in and one of\nthe brokers came in and said, \"Hey Matt,\" he was like,\n\"Can I show you something?\" I was like, \"Yeah, what's up?\" He goes, \"Look,\" he said, \"I've got this woman's W-2s here.\" I said, \"Okay.\" I looked at them and he goes, \"Here's your credit report.\" And he goes, \"Here's the,\nyou know, application. This is the Social Security number.\" I went, \"All right.\" And he said, \"This is the\nSocial Security number on the W-2.\" And I went, \"Okay.\" Keep in mind you go to get\na car loan or credit card. They never asked for these things. So, and he was like, and I'm really shocked he even noticed it. I probably might not have even caught it, but they were different. And I went, \"Really?\" And he goes, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"So I did, you know, she just brought them in,\nyou know, she's here.\" And I was like, \"Oh, bring her in here.\" So she came in, sat down, I said, \"Listen, here's what we just found.\" And she was like, \"Oh,\nokay. You know what? I don't want the loan, I just.\" I go, \"No, no, no, no,\" I said, \"Listen, you're getting the loan. You got a 750 credit score. Like, I don't care what we have to do. We're getting you the loan. I just wanna know what's going on. How did you get 750 credit scores under this Social Security number when clearly this is your\nreal Social Security number? You've been working for\nthis company for 10 years and your credit profile says it's only like three years old.\" And I was like, \"What happened?\" And what she told me she\ndid was she had been, she went through a divorce, she had been married for 10 years. Used her husband's, I mean\nhis surname for 10 years. So she has no credit\nunder her maiden name. But when they got divorced,\nshe switched to her maiden name because when she pulled,\ntried to get anything in her husband's surname, it was denied, bad credit. So he had bad credit,\ntheir credit went bad. So he switched to her,\nshe switched to her name and a friend told her if she\nneeded to get her electric or anything turned on,\nshe could use her name and use her daughter's or son's Social Security number, which was like a four-year-old kid. - Yep.\n- So she used that and it went through, she\nhad to put a deposit down, but it went through at\nleast, wasn't denied. So that went through. Then she went and she applied\nfor an apartment with that. Sure enough it went through. She had no credit, but they said, \"You don't have bad credit.\" So she said once she\nmoved into the apartment, she then started getting these\npre-approved credit cards. So she, she goes, but I\nknew I had applied there using my son's Social\nSecurity number, let's say. So she started filling those out and sure enough she got a\ncredit card and then she got two and then she got a pre-approval\nfrom Ford Motor Credit. She went and got herself,\na new car, got approved, she'd been making the payments ever since. She has 750 credit scores. She thought she'd try at\nbuying a house in his name, in his Social Security number. And we caught it and she\ngot a house in that name. We closed it. I just was like, wow. Like this is great. - Can I ask you a question about that? Because it seems like she's able to pay for everything.\n- Right. - So while this is highly illegal, is it unethical? Is it like, it's unethical\nin that it's messing with the system on which\na lot of people rely, but it feels like there's some aspect of the system that's broken in that it doesn't give people\nlike her a second chance. - She could have claimed bankruptcy and then two years later, listen, two years outta bankruptcy,\nyou can go into Bank of America and get a conventional mortgage, assuming you have perfect\ncredit outside the bankruptcy, you have the down payment,\nyou make enough money, there's a whole bunch of, you know, a bunch of underwriting\nguidelines you have to meet. But that's possible. But you're right. For instance, she wasn't\ngetting an apartment using, with her bad credit, she wasn't getting her\nutilities turned on. She wasn't getting any\nof those things done. - So getting your life back\non track is just harder. - It's extremely hard.\n- So there's a temptation to take the shortcut and the shortcut is often going to be illegal. - Right. And she stumbled into it. - Yeah.\n- But she basically explained it to me and I mean, I don't think she had walked\nout of my brokerage office before I went and I just started\nmaking up, you know, names and I think I went, I went\nand into our file cabinet and grabbed some people's\n1040s, which we had, you know, their tax returns and looked up children's\nSocial Security numbers and just grabbed some random\nkids' Social Security numbers and their name and went\nand pulled them and sure. And you know, but I\nchanged their date of birth to be an adult. Pulled it, and sure enough\nit came up, no file found, you know, didn't say fraud\nalert or fraud or anything. They didn't say, \"Mismatched this, mismatched that,\" didn't say anything. It just said, you know, \"No file found.\" Well then we went and we pulled, applied for a couple credit cards using a child's Social Security number. And then we went and pulled\nour own credit report and sure enough, it didn't\nsay \"No file found.\" It just said that there\nhad been two inquiries applying for credit cards. So I was like, wow, like\nthat's a credit profile. So that turns into me going to Social Security and calling\nor calling Social Security and trying to get them to issue\nme Social Security numbers to adults that had never had a Social Security number issued to them. I need to get Social Security number to give me a clean Social Security number. But I called up and of course, you know, I'm a novice, I don't\nreally know what I'm doing. So I call up and I say, \"Hey, yeah, I never had a Social\nSecurity number issued.\" And they were like, \"How old are you?\" And I was like, \"I'm 31\nyears old,\" you know? And they were, \"Yeah, that's not possible. Do you have a driver's license?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You have a bank account?\" \"Yeah.\" \"You have a Social Security number. Bring your driver's license in\nand we'll, we'll pull it up.\" Okay, well that's not gonna\nhappen. Hang up, call back. \"Hi, my son is seven years\nold or three years old and he never had a Social\nSecurity number issued.\" \"Oh, okay. Was he born in a hospital?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, he has one. He has one. Go ahead and get your son, come in here.\" No, I'm not doing that.\nHang up, call back. So I called back probably 10 times and eventually someone\nsaid, I kept altering it, kept altering what I was\nsaying till I got to the point where I was saying, \"My\nson was born with a midwife not in the hospital. And the pediatrician told\nus that we needed to go, we need to get Social Security to issue a Social Security number.\" And they would say, \"Well,\nhe should have issued it. But that does happen sometimes. So bring your son in and we'll, you know, you\ncan fill out the paperwork, we'll have one issued, you\nknow, first we'll check to see he never had one issued and if he hasn't we'll issue one.\" And so then it turned into, \"My son is out of the\ncountry and I need this.\" And then that turned into, \"Oh, I'm sorry. Well, how old is he?\" I was like, \"You know, he's three.\" And they go, \"Well, I'm sorry, if he's over the age of 12\nmonths old, he has to come in.\" Hang up the phone, call back. \"My son is 10 months old,\nhe's out of the country, born with a midwife, never\nhad a Social Security number.\" And then they go, \"Oh, okay, that's fine. Just get his birth certificate\nand his shot record and you can come in,\nfill out the paperwork, we'll issue you a Social Security number.\" And that's what I did. So I figured out how to\ncreate a birth certificate. You know, I ordered the\nsecurity paper, you know, when, where you make a copy, it says, you know, \"Void if copied.\" So I ordered, had to\norder a bunch of that, and I went online and figured out how to make a fake birth certificate. It was great too, 'cause\nlike the county actually, they give you a blank form and then they actually show you what it looks like filled out like a handwritten one filled out. So I knew if he was born\nthis day, he got these shots. Two months later he got these shots. Six months later he got these shots. So I just filled it out. I\neven had to order a seal. So you have to have a seal that says like, \"Hillsborough County Vital Statistics\" or \"Richland County Vital\nStatistics,\" or something. And I couldn't get anybody to make that. So I changed it to like\n\"Richland County Office of Virtual Records.\" And then I took like 220 grit\nsandpaper and hit it over and over and over again to wear it down. And then I, you know, I did the embossment on the corner and, you know, I printed it on the\nsecurity paper, embossed it. Nobody looks at those things. You could see Richland County, you know, you could kind of see that. And then really they just grab it and they go like this,\nthis is what you realize after you, when started getting\ndriver's licenses issued by the state DMV, right? The state, I figured out\neventually it was easier to just go into the DMV\nand have them give me a driver's license than actually make one. So, but you notice they\nwould just grab the thing, they'd feel the form and go, \"Okay.\" Like they don't even look at it. So, which is upsetting if you put as much work into these\ndocuments as I am for them to go, \"Okay, yeah, that's\ngood, sit over there.\" I felt like going like, \"Hey bro.\" - Yeah.\n- \"Like take a look at this. This is artwork.\"\n- Yeah, but they're looking for\nthe low hanging fruit of crappy fraud.\n- Right, yeah. This stuff was right through. So. - Okay, so birth certificate gets you a Social Security number. So it's interesting 'cause you've also, you've done a lot of different approaches to\ncreating synthetic people. There's homeless people involved. So sometimes it's grounded in real people or real names and then you're- - Right.\n- Like some part is fake, some part is real sometimes, and sometimes it's completely all fake. - Right, 'cause now I have the name, I have the Social Security number. And what's great is they mail you, what's even better is\nyou get, then you get to pick whatever name you want, you know, 'cause when you pick your child's name, he doesn't even have\nto have your last name, you pick any name. So I would pick a name and I'd just say, \"Oh, my\nwife's last name is this.\" If they questioned it,\nwhich they never did. But, you know, I've got\na Social Security number. And then I would go apply for credit cards and I'd get denied of course. But they would all offer\nme a secured credit card. So I'd then fill out\nthe secured credit card and I'd send them, send\nthe bank the money, and they would give me a\nsecured credit card for $500, $300, 1,000, whatever it was. And then once you start\nmaking the payments, I pulled the credit and a\ncredit profile shows up saying that this 31-year-old man with\nthe Social Security number that I know was issued, you know, a couple months ago\nhas three credit cards. They don't even say secure. They just say there's like,\nthis credit card is $500. It was issued by Bank of America. This one was issued by\nCapital One, this one. So I've got three of them,\nbut I had no credit scores. So at that point I kind\nof kicked back and waited and I just kept making payments. And I remember thinking to\nmyself, I'll bet you they don't, that the credit bureaus\ndon't generate credit scores for at least a year. And I was like, God, this is\ngonna be a year long process. And while that was\nhappening, I started other, I was starting other ones. 'Cause I figured at least\nin a year I'll have a bunch of these secure, you know, these, we call them like phantom borrowers, but now they call them\nsynthetic identities. So at least I would have\nthese synthetic identities and maybe I could do something with them. But what happened was,\nat six months I went and I randomly pulled the\nguy's credit, you know, the person's credit and\nthey had 705 credit scores, 705, 701, 695. I was like, \"Oh my God,\" you\nonly needed a 620 to borrow to get a 95% loan from the bank. So I was like, \"Oh my\nGod, this is amazing.\" Sure enough, a month later,\nthe other ones I had started all of them, bam, bam, bam. - So what do you do\nwith a phantom borrower? Like what, how do you make money on this? - So I think most people, if\nyou were just like a scammer, a fraudster, you would\nprobably just get credit cards and maybe build up that\nhistory or maybe try and borrow a personal loan,\nwhich is limited, you know, personal loans are used\nto be, you used to be, you could go to an FDIC insured\nbank, which borrows money. Those, you know, the\npersonal loans they lend out at the max $15,000, you\nknow, so you could do that. - So, you can go through\nthis whole process of creating a fake identity,\ngetting a card, paying it off, building up credit, and then you get $15,000 at the end or something>\n- Right, you get 15 maybe, you know, if you wanna\nkeep making the payments, you know, if you could wait a year, you could probably get 15,000. Maybe you could maybe get 20, 30,000 and a bunch of little smaller\nones, you know, you get 7,500. 'cause I did, I know did, there\nwas a $7,500 from Citibank, you know, $5,500 from American General. So you maybe get, what, 25,000, you know, maybe 30,000 in personal loans. Maybe you can, you could,\nyou could then apply for, you could maybe get another 20 or 30,000 in regular credit cards. You know, 10,000 here, 8,000, 5,000. And then you go to the\nlower department store cards and you go to Home Depot,\nyou get 1,000, you get 500. So it ends up being maybe\nyou can get 50, 60,000, maybe if you're really\ngood, you could get up to 80 or $100,000 in credit cards and personal loans if you really knew what you were doing. But.\n- Per person, per identity. - Per identity. But I had the ability to leverage that perfect, those\nperfect credit profiles against properties. And I mean, ultimately\nthat's what I end up doing. And so each one of those\nidentities was worth, you know, a few million. - Can you explain how that works? So to leverage them against property, so how does that work with a mortgage? - So what I did, yeah,\neventually, I mean, this was like, is down the road, but you know, I mean at this point when things are just, my whole life had kind\nof gone off the rails. I was on federal probation. And so what I did, decided what I was gonna do was\nstart running a scam, a much larger scam. And what I was going to do was, I was gonna start flipping\nproperties, right? Like buy houses cheap,\nfix them up and sell them. There's an area of Tampa called Ybor City. So I was gonna start\nflipping houses in Ybor City. And you know, I thought,\nokay, I can buy these houses for, you could buy a really\ncrappy house at that time for 50, $60,000, let's say 50. And then you could put $25,000\ninto it in renovations. You could renovate it for 25 and maybe you could get an\nappraisal for a hundred. So I thought what I could do is, I can buy these houses, renovate them and sell them to, you\nknow, regular people. But I also had been working\non the synthetic identities. And then I thought, well,\nor I could just sell them to synthetic identities and then I wouldn't have to\ndump 25,000 into it, right? And these guys are perfect.\nThey have perfect credit. I can provide W-2s and pay stubs because by this point I'm\nmanufacturing businesses. So I've got, I've incorporated businesses, I've got websites for the\nbusinesses, W-2s, pay stubs. So these guys have,\nthese guys look perfect. So I figure I'll buy these\nproperties for 50,000, sell it to these guys for a hundred. Maybe I'll pocket 40 or 50,000. I don't really have to do anything. But that seemed shortsighted. So I thought what'd be even better is that if I did a little bit of renovations and then I sold it for much higher, maybe I put 10,000, clean\nup the outside of it. 'cause these guys don't\ncare what the inside of the property looks like. You know, they don't exist. So, but I can't, how am\nI gonna get an appraisal for $100,000? Well, do you, you know\nhow appraisals work? Okay, so the bank sends\nit an appraisal out, or at that time you could\nprovide an appraisal and they can review it. So they'll do what's\ncalled a desktop review. They review it, they\nreview it on the computer, and they never go out to the property. Or they send someone out. They call that, you know,\nit's like a field review. They send someone out and\nthey just look at the house. They don't go in it though. So I have to clean out the, clean up the outside of the house. So what I did was, but the\nproblem is if your house is, you're trying to sell that\nhouse for let's say 200,000, the other houses, they have\nto pick three comparable sales in the area that are also going to support a $200,000 sales price. Well, there's no other houses selling for 200,000 near this house. So I thought if I wanna get\nthese things appraised for 200, 250,000, I have to have comparable sales. And that appraisal's going to be reviewed. So what I did was I started, I went out and I bought\nthis house for 50,000 and, I recorded the sale at 200,000. So when you buy a house for $100,000, you pay $700 in doc stamps. But if you pay the extra,\nan extra 700 bucks, the sale shows up for 200,000. I'm buying these things for 50. So I'm paying $350 and I'm just paying an extra $1,050. So it ends up being, you know, $1,400. But the sale shows up\nat 200,000 on a house that's a crack house I bought for $50,000. Now I go, I trim the\ntrees, we mow the yard, we clean up the porch, we\nput the porch rail on maybe, we paint it real nice. We black out all the windows,\nyou can't see inside. But from the curb, it looks great. And I get an appraisal. So\nI do that with that house. I do that within another\nhouse all within a mile. So I buy four houses\nknowing I could use the all, there's a subject and three\ncomparables for all of them. So the first thing I did is I\nbought four houses for 50,000, 60,000, 40,000. And I recorded the values\nat, you know, 210, 200, 190. So I get an appraiser to come\nout there, he appraises it, he says, of course, he\nsays, \"It's horrible, but there's comparables here.\" Now of course it is in bad shape. And he says it's in bad shape. But I go ahead and I correct\nall that, so I correct it. So now if you review the appraisal and you're in California, or even if you drive your car down, the appraiser comes to the house and looks at it from the\nstreet, it looks fine. But the truth is I've got\n$60,000 into this property and you're appraising it for 200,000. So the bank's ready to not,\nthey're not gonna lend 200, but they'll lend 190. So the bank is ready to lend this synthetic borrower $190,000 on a house that I have 60,000 in. So I walk, so I schedule a closing and we close on the house\nand I walk away with $60,000. You know, and the thing\nis, like, the problem was, is by the time I got to this point, I knew so many people in the industry. Nobody had to really\nat that point show up. Although I've had people show up for the synthetic identities and sign for them, almost all the closings,\nnobody ever showed up. I just showed up and said to\nthe title, to the title agency and said, \"Hey, my borrower,\nhe's at work right now. He can't make it, can I just take the file and I'll have him sign all the documents at his work and I'll bring them back. He's like an hour and\na half away from here, I'll be back in two or three hours.\" And they're like, \"Oh wow, that, man, Matt, thank you so much.\" And they would give it\nto me and I'd go sit in the parking lot and\nI'd sign all the documents and I'd wait an hour or\ntwo and I'd come back in and say, \"Here you go.\" - How were you able to\nkeep all this in your mind? 'Cause you have to not slip up in any of these conversations. - It's pretty easy for me to keep them everything in the correct category. Does that make sense? Like, I'm not great at a lot of things, but this I was very good at. - But well there's these\nphantom people that exist and they were becoming real\npeople in your mind as in like, you're able to tell good stories\nwith those people, right? Like, because if you're\ntalking to the appraiser, if you're talking to the\neverybody in involved, - Well, keep in mind the appraiser almost never meets the borrower. Never. Not even almost. Like 99.99, 99% of the\ntime they never meet them. - [Lex] But you have to talk about them. - Yeah. - So I guess what I'm\nasking is you're able to converse fluently about\nthese synthetic identities. - Yeah, they all had different jobs. They all had, all the jobs were basically, they were all on the job for five years. They were all, it was, a lot of it was-\n- Yeah, sure, there's a template.\n- Yeah, exactly. But.\n- Yeah, got it. - You know, listen, all matter of fact, almost every one of them\nhad the same birthdate, you know, so, because\nI, you know, who knows? There's, so yeah, it wasn't difficult. And keep in mind, a lot of the brokers barely ever meet the bar. They call in on the phone,\nbut it didn't matter anyway, 'cause I'm walking in saying, \"I got a slam dunk deal for you.\" And they're like, \"Oh wow,\nMatt, you got the W-2s, the pay stubs, you've got all the, you've got all their rental history, you have everything done. It's perfect. Thank you so much.\" They're happy to do it. \"Hey, I print up the docs and\nI'll have them go sign it.\" \"Great. Wow, thank you.\" You know, assuming they\ndidn't already know about it and almost everybody involved in this, by the time I was done, was\ninvolved, there was probably 15 or 20 people that all\nknew it was going on. - The full of it. They knew the full depth of it. - Yes. Yeah, maybe not 100% everything, but they definitely knew this is fraud. - And they were still going along with it. - Yeah. Yeah. Keep in mind that even when,\nI'll give you an example. One of my, you know, let's take, and this happened with almost all of them, was he would buy five houses. So the guy buy, what\nhappens, the basic design was I buy the houses, I\nrecord the values higher, and this person buys all five houses, refinances them, he ends up borrowing a little bit over $1\nmillion dollars in his name. Then of course, then I go and I get personal loans\nfrom several banks. I get credit cards, I run\nup all of his credit cards. By this point I've got 10, $20,000 worth of credit cards in the guy's name. So the guys are all worth like\na million, million in change. Well, once I stop paying, you start getting letters from the collection companies, right? From the banks, you know,\nand then they sell them off. So after about three months,\nyou're getting tons of letters. And what I would do is I\nwould take my borrower's name, I would go online and I would find, or I'd go in the newspaper I would find an article about, let's say like a 12 car pile up. You know, so there's, you know, this huge accident on I four. It's very dangerous. So there's a 12 car pile up and someone in the\naccident was life flighted to Tampa General Hospital. I would cut and paste that article and I would just insert my borrower's name into the article saying that, you know, Brandon Green was life flighted to Tampa General Hospital's\ncurrently in critical condition. I would then print that\narticle out on newsprint. I then make a copy of the,\ncut it up, make a copy of the newsprint, highlight his name, and I would write a letter\nfrom Brandon Green's fictional sister to the\ncollection companies saying, \"Several months ago, my brother was in a horrible car accident. He is currently,\" they've got the article, they have the highlighted name. He clearly was in this accident. He is currently in a coma. And the doctors say even if\nhe wakes up from the coma, he will never work again. That you know, so you might\nas well just foreclose on, stop writing us letters\nand take the houses back. And that's all they're\nlooking for is a reason. At this point, even if they\nlook into Brandon Green, they can't figure out if\nhe's a real person or not because he's got a Social Security number. He's got, and everything\nwent bad at the same time. He's got multiple rental properties or his primary residence. All of his credit cards went\nbad. Everything went bad. We have an excuse, we have\na letter, that happens. People get divorced, they lose their job, they get in accidents, it's reasonable. - When they look into it,\nit all looks legitimate. - Even if they ordered another appraisal, by this point it's not\nfour comparable sales or three or four comparable sales. By this point, it's like\n10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 'cause I kept making more\nand more of these guys. - What was your, just a,\nalmost like a tangent. What's your thinking process? There's a lot of cleverness going on here. So like the car pile up as a solution, the newspaper and you mail it. What, are you sitting there\nalone and thinking through this? Like how do you come up with that idea? It's a very interesting, a\nvery clever, innovative idea. - So at first, I thought about making like a fake death certificate\nand he died, you know? But I thought, \"Oh, I don't\nknow, like what if, you know, like some of these places\nhad like, you know, primary mortgage insurance, like what if the primary\nmortgage insurance, like what if they try and\nclaim 'cause he was dead or like, I don't know,\nI don't know that side. So I'm like, ugh, I don't wanna do that.\" I wanna do something\nthat's semi verifiable and third party, it's like a third party telling you this is what happened. I thought, well, like the\nnewspaper, you know, and you know, or do I claim bankruptcy? And I've done that, I've gone and got the bankruptcy forms, right? You can go to bankruptcy court and they'll give you forms to mail to all of your creditors\nand you mail them. They stop contacting and\nthey wait to be no located by or notified by the bankruptcy court. But my fear there is, you know, nobody's ever gonna notify them. Like, I'm not going through bankruptcy for one of these guys. So it was like, this is a better bet than just writing a letter saying, \"I'm going through a divorce. My wife's keeping those\nhouses. That's her problem.\" You know, you could do, there's\nlots of things you could do, but to me this was, they're not gonna try. And how do you shut it\ndown without him dying? How do you shut that down?\nThis is how you shut it down. He's in a coma. He'll never work again. He was in a car accident. Here's the proof, he can't even write you. I'm his sister. I wrote you the letter. - [Lex] It's a one time letter\nthat seems to tie up all - Tie, exactly.\n- Loose ends. - Exactly. You know, I don't know exactly how that, you know, what sparked\nthat as much as there were so many other avenues that I\ncould have gone that I was, I just didn't know I was-\n- But you were thinking through all those different avenues. - Yeah.\n- Are you mostly thinking alone?\n- I mean, you know, I had guys that I was bouncing- - Ideas from.\n- Ideas off of, there were other guys that were involved in the scam, you know, everybody. I think that scam ended up making like, I think the FBI said, it was like 11 and a half\nmillion or something. And you know, but there were so many other\npeople that were involved in that scam that were, you\nknow, this guy's getting 50, this guy's getting 20, you\nknow, 17,000, 20,000, 25,000. And you know, we're just\ndoing it constantly. And so the bank would\nforeclose on that property. They'd take it back, they'd\nput it back on the MLS, they put it back on the MLS for a hundred, for 200,000 it wouldn't sell. Then they'd drop it to, you\nknow, 150 wouldn't sell. Then they'd drop it to\n125, 130, wouldn't sell. They'd drop it to 90 and\nsomebody buy it for like 90. It wasn't worth 90. But by that point, that\nwhole area had, we'd done so many houses at that point,\nthe whole area shot up. And the FBI said we did 109 houses. I don't think that's true, but. - Wow.\n- When I end up leaving Tampa after that scam falls apart and the FBI shows up, \"Forbes\"\ncame out with an article, whatever six months later, and they said that the Ybor City zip code was one of the top 20 fastest\ngrowing appraising areas in the country. And, you know, everybody\nwas like, \"Oh, that's Matt, 'cause this place is a dump. Like this is a horrible\nplace, like this is.\" And I remember one time\nI had talked to a guy, you know, years later and he was like, \"Ah, all the comparable\nsales have dried up. Like when you left, there was just nothing\neven close to 200,000.\" - You mentioned right\nbefore telling the story of this elaborate scam that you were on federal probation. How did that happen? - So I mentioned that I\nowned the mortgage company. - Yes.\n- Right, so I had started a mortgage company, I had maybe\na dozen guys working for me. And there was fraud. You know, like I would\nsay it wasn't all fraud, but whatever, 60, 70% of it was fraud that was going in there. And from the outside of that business, it looked very legitimate. You know, we were an FHA approved lender. We were a VA approved lender. We did conventional,\nprobably signed up with 40 or 50 subprime lenders. But there was a considerable\namount of fraud. And, you know, it kept getting, you know, it became a game, right? You know, you start, I started getting just\nmore and more creative. Like I said, every time I\nwould get away with something, like, you become emboldened by it, it's like, nice, you know, like, hey, the underwriter's looking for this and looking for this. And you sit there and go,\n\"Man, so that she's, you know, that's what am I gonna do, what am I? You know what we could do? We could create our own bank.\" \"What?\" \"Yeah. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go on, like how do they know if this bank exists? These people are in California,\nthey're in New York. Like they don't know. So what we're gonna do is,\nwe're gonna go online,\" and keep in mind this is 2000,\nyou know, this is 2000, 2001. Like this is, the Internet's in its infancy still, right? So we figure out, I remember GoDaddy, I think had just come up with a site where you could build your own website. Like how cool is that? So I go online with a buddy of mine and we create something\ncalled the Bank of Ybor. You know, we cut and pasted things that we like from other banks and we got a one 800\nnumber you could call, or a 186 number, whatever it was. And you could call it, and\nit would go to a voicemail. And so we set up this bank and then I ended up\nmaking bank statements, which by this point I already had been making bank statements to prove someone has their down payment. 'Cause a lot of times people,\nthey have good enough credit to borrow 95% or 90%, but they don't have their down payment. So we'd raise the\npurchase price high enough to cover their five or 10% down payment, and we would bring their\ndown payment for them. Or we'd have the owner of the house bring the\ndown payment for them. And then we would have a check cut out of the closing statement to a construction company that I owned. And we get our money back. So they get into the house\nfor 100% financing, or 110%. Some of them turned into 130. We wanna pay off their car,\ngive them an incentive to sign. They don't have, still don't\nhave the money to buy it. So we are doing all\nkinds of insane things. Well, at some point, remember Gretchen Zayas, my old manager? - Yeah. The original, OG.\n- Yes. She came and worked for me\nfor a short period of time, and then she and her husband went and opened their own mortgage company, which you should have known\nit was gonna be fraudulent from the get-go because it\nwas called Creative Financing. It was, yeah, CFM, creative Finance. No, creative, it was-\n- Creative was in the name. - Yeah. Yeah. Creative was in the name. - [Lex] Oh boy. - So.\n- It's really on the nose. - So she's doing very well. And we became very close by the way, where we'd go on vacation,\nwent to Puerto Rico together. I got married at the time.\nI got, I was married. Our kids, you know, play together. We babysit, we go to each other's parties. We're close, we're good friends. And she's got her own mortgage company. She calls me up periodically and asks me, \"Hey, can you make a W-2? Or Hey, can you make me a pay stub?\" \"Sure, no problem.\" We're friends. That's what\nfraudulent friends do. So, you know, if I needed\nsomebody to verify rent or verify somebody's rental history or employment, she had cell\nphones she would answer, that sort of thing for me. Well, what ends up happening is, she gets in trouble. She starts doing fraudulent\nloans for some guys, you know, and these guys are doing\nwhat's called a cashback scam. So they're getting like a\nhalf a million dollar loan on a house that's worth $300,000. So they're getting,\nthey're buying the house for whatever, 600,000. It's really only worth 300, 350. But she happened to be in an\narea where she could get it, the appraisal jacked up. So they buy the house,\nthey get two, $300,000 back and it's a straw man scam, right? It's a cash back straw man scam. So this is a real person\nthat's buying the house. He's got perfect credit,\nbut he's willing to let, to ruin his credit to get a couple hundred\nthousand in his pocket. So he never has any intentions. So it's not a synthetic identity, it's not a stolen identity. It's a straw man, he's a fake kind of a, not a fake person, but\nhe is just a straw man. He's a stand-in, so he stands\nin, he signs the paperwork, he buys the house. They end up getting 2, 300,000. Well, this guy buys like five houses. So it is two, $3 million. They've lost 5, 600, 6, $700,000. And these guys never even\nmake the first payment. They just let them go into foreclosure. So the bank immediately investigates and realizes this is fraud. So the FBI comes in, they\ngrab Pete and Gretchen. She has to hire an attorney, of course. And she doesn't get thrown\nin jail or anything. They just come to their office and they tell them they're\ninvestigating them. They know what's going on\nand they wanna talk to, they're like, \"Well,\nlook, we wanna talk to you and you're going to be indicted.\" Okay, so she comes to me,\nwell actually Pete came to me and said, \"Look man, can\nyou refinance our house and get a 75,000 out to pay our attorney?\" I said, \"No problem.\" Gretchen gives me W-2s, pay stubs fake. The whole thing's fake. I get her, I refinance, I get a second mortgage\non her house, $75,000. They pay their attorney. Their attorney immediately says, \"you need to wear a wire on this guy. Like, he just got you $75,000. You know, I don't know\nhow you got $75,000.\" The, the attorney knows something's wrong, 'cause the attorney's like, they just, \"Your whole mortgage\ncompany was just shut down. There's no way you could borrow $75,000.\" So he is like, \"This guy's\ndoing fraudulent stuff.\" And she says, \"Yes, of course he is.\" And he says, \"You need to work with the FBI, wear a\nwire against this guy.\" So she calls me one day and says, \"Listen, I gotta talk to you. The FBI's asking questions about you.\" And I go, \"What?\" And she goes, \"Yeah.\" And I was like, \"Meet me at a\npizza place down the street.\" So, you know, don't come into my office, 'cause everybody knows\nshe's been indicted. Like everybody in her\noffice quit when the FBI, if the FBI shows up and\ngives you a business card and announces they're\nthe FBI, everybody quits. So I said, \"Don't come here.\" 'Cause they already know,\nthey're already concerned. So I go and I meet her and Pete and we sit down at a restaurant, you know, a little pizzeria. And I sit down and she starts telling me that the FBI's asking questions about me. And I'm like, \"Well, what\nare you talking about? Like, what are they asking?\" And she goes, \"Look, they came\nin, they took all our files.\" And like, I was like, \"I\ndidn't know any of this. I'm like, when did this happen?\" She's like, \"Yeah, they\nhave a couple weeks ago. And they have some of your files.\" 'Cause I had closed several loans for my wife at the time. We were buying rental properties.\nMy wife didn't have a job. So they're, it's all fraud. But I couldn't close, I\ncould not close those loans in at my mortgage company\nbecause I owned the property. So I'm selling those properties. I bought properties, renovated them and sold them to my wife to get around something called seasoning. Seasoning says you have to\nwait six months to a year to refinance at the market value. Otherwise you, if you wanna\nrefinance, that's fine, but you have to refinance at the price you\npurchased the property at. But I bought these properties for 80 or 100,000, renovated\nthem, sold them for 2, 300,000 to my, my wife who got a very, didn't even get a big mortgage. We were just trying to kind\nof get around a guideline. So, but my wife was not working and I provided W-2s and pay stubs. So when she says all\nthis, she says, \"Yeah, they're looking at the loans you gave me, at your wife's loans.\" And I went, \"Oh my God.\" I said, \"Well, you didn't tell them that the W-2s were fake, did you? You didn't tell them the pay\nstubs were fake, did you? You didn't tell them that\nthe down payments were, you didn't tell them that\nwe were married, did you?\" I mean, just absolutely buried myself. - Yeah.\n- And as I'm telling her this, I was like, okay, I was\nlike, I kind of caught myself and I'm, \"Okay, wait, wait, wait a minute. Look, okay, here's what\nyou're gonna tell them. You are going to tell\nthem you never met her. She called on the phone.\" Like, I start trying to devise a plan that will answer their questions without getting my wife in\ntrouble or them in trouble. And if nobody cooperates, the\nwhole thing should shut down. You know, they, it doesn't go anywhere. There's no way, there's\nnowhere for them to go if everybody just kind of stonewalls them. So, as I'm saying all this, Gretchen says, \"Matt, we can't lie to the FBI.\" And I go, \"What are you talking about? You're already lying to the\nFBI mean, you, you know, you've been lying to the FBI, I mean, I just refinanced your house.\" And before I can really say\nanything, Pete jumps up, her husband stands up, and he says, 'We've never lied to the FBI. We may not have told them\neverything, but we've never lied.\" And I thought, like,\nwho are you talking to? Like, I know that's not true. So you're not saying that for my benefit. So I was just, I kind of look\nat them and I'm like, \"What?\" And I just, I remember looking down and this may mean nothing, but both of their cell\nphones were right next to me. Right? And I remember they were\nprobably just wearing wires, but I just remember thinking those cell phones are microphones. - Yeah.\n- They probably weren't. But I remember thinking, oh, wow. And I just, I looked at\nit and I went, \"Wow.\" And I said, \"Well, I hope you're gonna get something for this.\" And she immediately starts crying and she says, \"Matt, I'm sorry. I have a kid. I can't go to jail.\" - Do you have kids at that point? - Yeah. I like, I have a\nkid. Like I have a kid. And I was like, \"Wow. I, wow.\" - What have you learned\nabout friendship from that? Like, loyalty? - Oh yeah, there's no, there's, that's a, that's, it's sweet. - That must have hurt.\n- It's cute. I mean, I love the idea of it. - You don't think that?\n- No. I'll tell you why. So I go back to my office. I remember I told her, I said, \"Tell the FBI agent to\ncall me on the phone. Do not come in my office.\" So I go back, I'm still trying to figure out how to weather this, right? I go back, I sit down, phone rings, my secretary comes in and says, \"Hey agent, I'll never\nforget the guy's name, agent Scott Gale with the FBI.\" And I was like, \"Okay, he's on the phone.\" And she's standing there. I was like, 'Close the door,\nlike get out and close it.\" She's like. So get on the phone. He asked me if I'll come down. I said, \"Yeah, absolutely. Let's schedule it for next Tuesday.\" You know, I put it off four or five days. I go to my brother-in-Law\nimmediately, who's a lawyer. And he says, \"Oh, yeah, yeah,\" I don't really tell him exactly what's going on, but I tell him this is what's happening, kind of. And I may be in trouble, I need\na federal defense attorney. I don't even know what a federal defense, I don't even know the difference. But he said, \"You need a\nfederal defense attorney. It's the FBI.\" So we go on a couple, we\nmeet a couple lawyers. I end up getting a lawyer.\nI give him like 75 grand. And he started to have me convinced, initially he had me convinced I was probably gonna go to jail for a few years. But really that's what they kind of do to justify you giving them $75,000. - Right.\n- And then, but the more I thought about\nit, you know, and read, he gave me the guidelines that supposedly I had, you know, the fraud that I had\ncommitted and what the guide and the guidelines that oversaw that. And I read it and I was like,\nI'm not really in trouble here because I'm looking at a felony, but I'm not gonna go to jail\nbecause there was no potential for the bank to lose money. So, because I bought the house with like a hard money loan, and then I renovated it with my own cash. And when I sold it, it\nappraised at 250,000. My ex-wife borrowed like 180. So there's plenty of equity. If the whole thing had\ngone into foreclosure, they still would've got their money back. And to be honest, by the\ntime all this happened, there was only like three\nof the three properties. It was like five. But\nwe'd already sold a few. And at this point, we'd\njust sold another two. There's like one or two properties left. So we're selling, at that\nmoment we were selling them. So I was like, no, I\nkind of argue with him. But then he wanted 75\ngrand. I gave him 75 grand. And then he comes back\nand he says, good news, there was no potential fraud. So I can get you three years. Now here's the thing, here's what I always kind of look back at. When I first went into\nhis office, he said, he said, \"Listen, you\nhaven't been indicted yet. I spoke with the FBI spoke\nwith the US Attorney, they believe, and they've been told,\" and he said, \"Look, they\ndidn't tell me exactly what they have, but they\nsaid with the evidence that they have on you based on\ntwo confidential informants, that it's, you cannot go to trial.\" And I was like, \"Right,\"\nof course I knew that. And I was like, okay. He said, \"But,\" he said, \"You\nhaven't been indicted yet. And they are fairly certain\nthat you're running a mill. Right? A fraud mill over there. And that you guys are\nchurning out fraudulent loans. Now they can't come and they\ncan't come and raid your office and do anything about it yet, 'cause so far they only have you. But here's what I'm\nsaying is that,\" he said, \"I can keep you from being indicted. It's called pretrial, is\na pretrial intervention where we go in and what we'll do is you go, you work, you go in, talk to the\nFBI, you go grab a bunch of your mortgage brokers'\nmost egregious files, grab them, bring those files to the FBI, go work with the FBI,\nthey will indict them and you will not be indicted.\" And I said, which I\nkick myself to this day. I said, \"Absolutely not. I'm\nnot gonna snitch on them. I'm not gonna cooperate,\nI'm not going to, you know, I'd seen the godfather, you're\nnot supposed to cooperate. You're supposed to be loyal and I'm not gonna do any of that.\" And it, you know, and so I say all of this where, you know, looking back like I would've, if I could go back in time, I would've gone into our\nweekly meeting with a dolly and I would've walked\nin front of everybody and scooped up two or\nthree of the file cabinets and put them in the back of a truck and said, \"Listen, you\nguys are gonna be talking to the FBI soon, I suggested\nyou get attorneys.\" And I would've driven,\ndriven off. But I didn't. I thought, no, be loyal.\nYou know, don't do that. And what happened was, when the other thing falls apart, right? When the next scam falls apart,\nevery one of these people go to the FBI, like, they're\nnot even coming to them. These guys are going to\nthe FBI with lawyers. \"I wanna cooperate. I wanna\ntell you what Cox did. I want to help, I want to,\" and I'm thinking like I\nnever had to get indicted to begin with. - So you think that most of these people from your\nexperience, are going to sacrifice all integrity. That's a funny word, sacrifice. - [Matt] Sure, that applies\nto this. But that's- - Right. - They're going to sacrifice friendships and loyalty for just to\nsave them their own ass. - Yeah, I only had one person that did not talk to the FBI. I had one person that every time the FBI or the Secret Service went to\nthat person's door, she said, \"Don't come to my house again. I don't have anything to say about Matt. I have nothing to do with any\nof this. Talk to my lawyer.\" And this happened over and over again. And that's my ex-wife. She's a gangster. - So are there people in\nthis world you trusted or you still trust? - I, you know, the problem is eventually I cooperate. And at the time I didn't wanna cooperate. I didn't believe in cooperation. But after seeing how many people cooperate and the way the system is set up, I think that my understanding of loyalty is vastly more realistic now. And I think that if you\nare committing crime, if you are absolutely\nlike the things I did, I did a bunch of scumbag\nthings, you know, I mean, I'm not killing people, but\nI'm doing scumbag things. I'm lying, cheating,\nstealing that, I'm a thief. You know, you boil down\nto it. That's what I am. So you can't go around\nbehaving like a scumbag, dealing with scumbags and then expect those same\nscumbags to suddenly abide by some kind of a street code\nand not roll over on you. You know? And it does happen. But it's like in the,\nit's in the 90 percentile of people that cooperate\n90 something percent. And people cooperate when they're not even\nlooking at any real time. So if you're looking at\n30 years and especially after going to prison, you go to prison and it's like, this guy's\na standup guy over here. He got 30 years. He could have cooperated against\nall of his co-defendants, but he didn't, nobody comes to see him. His wife divorced him. You know, his kids\nended up in foster care. His, you know, his friends are\nare cleaning out his house. Nobody puts money on his books. Nobody comes to see him. Nobody\nanswers his phone. Nothing. He took 30 years. Most of those guys turned around, they end up getting\nindicted for other things. Years later, they cooperate. And the best thing this\nguy's got going for him is that he can walk around and\nsay, well, he's a standup guy. That guy's going to the\nsame halfway house as me. He's probably, he's gonna do\n30 years where I'm gonna do 10. - A standup guy, meaning\nhe never snitched. - [Matt] Right. - And so everybody's seeing this example and saying, well, I'm\ngoing to snitch then. But it sounds like what people are doing\nis they're signaling, virtue signaling, like there\nare, they would never snitch and actually do secretly. - I mean, what is it? I remember I talked to one of the COs at the prison one time, and he said, I said, \"Shit,\" I said, \"50%\nof the guys here snitched.\" He goes, \"It's more than that.\" He said, \"But listen, he goes,\" 100% of them are lying about it.\" He said, \"So you'll,\" he\ngoes, \"There's nobody here that's gonna tell you\nthey snitched, nobody.\" So there's guys, tons\nof them that cooperate. If 80, 90% of defendants cooperate, you know, you start doing the math and you, if you ask 10 guys in prison, all of them say, \"I didn't cooperate. I didn't cooperate. I didn't cooperate.\" Like, okay, well you ask\n100, \"I didn't cooperate.\" Like, nobody's gonna say, \"I cooperated.\" - Does that break your heart a little bit that people back stab\neach other like this? - It does, it does. But you know, but I have such a low opinion of people, you know what I'm saying? Like, I don't expect it. It's not that I don't like people, it's that I just don't\nexpect anything of them. You know, I don't expect\nyou to look out for me. You know, there was a time when I did, I thought, I look out for you,\nyou should look out for me. But I just don't expect that anymore. - See, but I think humanity flourishes because there is a lot of people\nout there that do the thing that is difficult to do\nin terms of integrity. - That may be, but these\naren't people with integrity. These are criminals. If these were decent human beings, and all of them will tell\nyou, \"Well, why'd you do that? \"Oh, you know, I was a drug\naddict or I needed the money.\" Well, if you were, if you\nwere a decent human being, you would have gotten off the drugs. You would've gone and gotten three jobs. You can work 80 hours\na week, I've done it. You can work 84, 85, 80, you\ncan work 90 hours a week. You can do that. \"Oh,\nI did it for my kids.\" No, you're lazy. You could have worked\nthree jobs for your kids. Instead you decided to\nsell methamphetamine. \"Well, I was addicted.\" You\ncould've gotten off meth. It wasn't important. It\nwas the easy way out. You're not someone with integrity. So for you to sit there and say, \"Hey, I'm gonna act like a\nscumbag, but now I got caught or you got caught, and I\ndon't want you to tell on me.\" Well, you're a guy that robs banks. You stick guns in people's faces. You kidnap people, you torture\npeople, you sell drugs. You're not, you're not\na moral, ethical person. But you want, you want\neverybody else to hold up to some ethical code while\nyou're robbing grandma. That's not right. Like,\nyou know, so, you know, I get the whole Omerta code, you know, and there was a mo there was\na time when I was, you know, delusional enough to believe that. But you know, after you're going through it, no. And after going through\nit multiple times, no. - I have to really think about that. And I deeply appreciate\nyour honesty on this. - Because it's, I think, I mean, there's all kinds of\ncriminals in this world, and they all have all kinds of stories. And your story is one of, I don't know if it came from\ndesperation versus a love of this kind of game, right? Like, it wasn't part of it. And attraction to the\ncreative aspect of this, of breaking the rules\nwhen nobody else can, and you figure out a way to do it. - I think initially it was, I needed the money. Like that's the first thing, you know? You say, \"Oh, okay, well I\nneed,\" and if you ask most guys, \"Oh, well man, I needed the money.\" You needed the money. But, and then I definitely\nneeded the money. But then you get $50,000 in your bank and then you get 100, and then it's 200, and then it's half a million\nand then it's a million. And what the hell are you\nstill committing fraud for? You've got half a million or\na million dollars in the bank or worth of real estate, or you've, you're making five, $10,000 a month just in rental income. Why are you still committing fraud? So it turn, I think it\nmorphs into the creativity in part for me. And two, it was a chance\nfor me to prove to everybody how smart I was, you know? I mean, it was done outta\ndesperation initially, and then it just turned into\npure narcissistic arrogance. Look at me, look at how I can do things that nobody else can do. Look how smart I am. I just walked into Bank\nof America, handed them seven documents that were all fraudulent and they cut me a check for $250,000. Like, wow, I'm amazing.\nYou know? And guess what? They're never gonna get their check. And they won't know even\nknow where to start to try and find the person because\nthey're looking for a phantom. So, you know, and you\nfeel great. I felt great. I used to, I felt like James Bond. I felt like 007. It was amazing. And, you know, and it did, it feeded my need to feel important. You know, even if it was, it was even if that was a lie, 'cause all that success was just a lie. - Well, no, you were good at it. - I was good at it, but it was, it's not- - It was illegal.\n- It's not like I'm Elon Musk, you know what I'm saying? Like, there's, it's not like\nI'm an exceptional human. I'm an exceptional human\nbeing at a horrific thing at committing fraud. - Well, the question is, how\nmany people are getting hurt? Because-\n- Initially the thing is, initially nobody got hurt. That's the thing. Nobody ever lost any money directly. Like I didn't go and say, give me $50,000 and I\nran off with your money. Like I wasn't doing that and\nthat was a great justification. But at some point, and we\nwe'll get into that, you know, I take off on the run\nand people do lose money. I didn't take that money directly and for some reason in my, you know, sick mind or whatever the case may be, that seems like a distinction\nto me that makes me feel okay, is that I never said, \"Give\nme 300, give me $10,000.\" And I ran off with it. But I put people in a position\nwhere I damaged the credit or damaged the title to their house. And they had to go get a\nlawyer to fix that, you know? And so that they had to\ngo pay a lawyer $10,000. So I absolutely caused that\nperson that I stood, to me to, you're a victim and I owe you that money. And it was a shitty thing to do because even at the time I was like, \"Oh, they'll make a couple\nphone calls, it'll be fine.\" It wasn't fine. And if I had really put\nany thought into it all, I would've known it's gonna\nreally affect these people. And those people had done nothing wrong with the exception of trusting me. They rented me their house, or they owner financed their house. They made the mistake of bumping into me and now they owe 10,000, $20,000. You know? And I'm sure a a ton of anguish. - So what happened when you\nwere caught that first time? - So I was caught. I got\nthree years probation. You know, I took the probation. - What does that involve?\n- Initially it was, it was such a slap on the wrist. - Were you allowed to still practice being the-\n- No, well, okay, so I wasn't, I had to, I couldn't own the\nmortgage company anymore. That was a good question,\n'cause like I, you would think, you know, wouldn't it be great\nif I could keep on going? But what they said was, you know, \"You have to forfeit your brokers license and your brokerage business license.\" And what I did was, I transferred my brokerage\nbusiness license to a guy that essentially bought my business. They allowed me to work as a consultant in the mortgage industry. You know, 'cause they\nwent, you know, they go, my lawyer goes to the judge and\nsays, \"What else can he do?\" So, and so I have a friend, his name's Dave Walker, he was a CPA. He came in and he bought my business and he paid me like $9,000 a month. And that covered my bills. My wife and I got divorced. So she's my ex-wife. And, I don't know what to do, right? Like, I don't, I could, you know, and I always say, you know,\nI could have like, you know, you look back and it's like, I could have claimed bankruptcy. I could have moved into my\nparents' spare room, you know, something like that. But, you know, 'cause I had, I lost everything in my divorce. I had huge child support\npayment, you know, not that that has anything\nto do, like with my ex-wife. Like, I absolutely signed up for that. Like, I wanted to pay that. But it was a chunk of change, you know. So we're talking about a\ncouple thousand dollars a month for, you know, for child support. She got all of the apartments that we had. We had about a million, million and a half dollars\nworth of apartments, which isn't a lot now,\nbut that's probably five or $6 million now. So she got all the apartments,\nso she got everything. So now I'm sitting here like I got, I can't be a mortgage\nbroker, I can get my $9,000, but I have to help this\nguy run this company, train people, do that sort of thing. So what I decided to do was, I was gonna start flipping houses. - Legitimately or no? - Well, initially I thought about doing it legitimately, right? But at the same time, I\nwas also in the middle of figuring out how to make\nthese synthetic identities. So I'm making the payments\nevery month, remember? Two months in, three months?\nNo, no credit scores. No credit scores. No credit scores. And I'm also saying, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna start buying houses,\nrenovate them, sell them. So the truth is, we actually renovated probably one house completely. I remember it was on 26th Street. We renovated the house completely. - On the outside in and the inside? - Yeah, outside, inside.\nIt's done. It's good. - [Lex] Okay, great. - Me and this guy actually, Dave Walker, the guy that bought my business. So we renovate it and it just\nso happens at the same time, I go to pull the credit one day and wow. 700 plus credit scores. And I went, \"We don't have\nto sell this thing at all.\" Like we just, we can just, I can sell it and put it in this guy's name\nand let him refinance it. And so that's what we did. We ended up, I ended up selling it to this synthetic identity. - Do you remember the first\nsynthetic identity? The name? - The first one was a Joel Cologne. - Yeah.\n- And then I started getting creative because the ones after that, I started naming well, so\nI had like Joel Cologne and an Allen Duncan. But then I, do you remember\nthe movie, \"Reservoir Dogs?\" - [Lex] Hmm-mm. - So I started naming the characters after guys in the \"Reservoir Dogs.\" So I had a James Red, you know,\nI had like a Michael White, a Lee Black, I had a William Blue, David Silver, Brandon Green. So then I start developing these guys. Now I thought, oh, forget\nthose normal things. I'm going with these with\nthe \"Reservoir Dogs.\" And I thought I was so cute too. - You think in retrospect\nthat was a mistake? - It was so stupid. That was just, it's just,\nthere's so many things, so many mistakes I made. I mean, within the fraud,\nthere are mistakes I made. But, you know, other than just\nthe overall committing fraud. But it was just like, I\nthought it was so cute. And then, you know, you\nget in front of the judge and the judge is hearing\nabout the \"Reservoir Dogs,\" and Mr. Green and Mr. Black,\nMr. White, Mr. This, Mr. That. And he's looking at me\njust like, \"You jackass.\" Like, and you know, what am I saying? I'm like, \"Yeah, I thought that was cute,\" you know, but nothing's cute. So, you know, plus I'm making fake banks. - What's the purpose of the fake banks? - Well, sometimes you have\nto have your down payment in the bank, right? So you have to, they\nwant three months worth of bank statements to see that, hey, he's got his $50,000 in the bank. And then the more, the\nmore properties you buy, they start to want to see\nwhat's called reserves. They wanna make sure that you can pay all your mortgage payments. If this guy loses his job, can this guy maintain all\nthese mortgage payments for the next six months? And see they do that and\nthey think you're gonna go, you know, \"Oh no, he can't do it.\" They go, \"Well then we won't lend it.\" Well, when they do that to\nme, I go, \"Of course I do. Of course he's got it. Let me send you over the bank statements. Oh, you want to call the bank? Call them.\" - [Lex] So there's a phone\nnumber, there's a website. - Yes, you can call. We'll get on there. I'll do the whole, (Matt imitates typing) you know, and \"Hold on, okay, what's the name again? Do you have the account number? (Matt imitates typing) Hold on.\" You wait a little bit.\nYou know, you come out. \"Oh, okay, I got it here. I can't tell you the\nexact amount right now, but what was his balance last month?\" And you, you tell. \"Oh, yep. That that's it.\nExactly. Okay. Thank you.\" Click. - Would you do different voices\nor would you be the same? - No, I've done different voices or I'd just have somebody else do it. You know, Gretchen would've done it. Or one of the brokers,\nSusan would've done it. One of the brokers that worked\nfor me, or you know, Kelly or Johnny Moon, or, I\nmean, I have so many guys and you know, they just get\non the phone and they do it, 'cause they're all doing something fraud and we're all working together. So, hey, I need you to call this guy. I need to call this guy and verify this and say, \"Oh, I'm at the bank. Okay, I'm at the bank. Okay, cool.\" And they call back. And- - Does this feel like an organized system or was it more improv, just like dealing with the different situations? - The government would\ndefinitely say it was organized. I always say it was, you\nknow, you're a bunch of, it's just a bunch of guys,\nyou know, to, you know, it's, you're joking around with everybody and you're helping each other\nand it's not like everybody's, you know, kicking up to Tommy. - Yeah.\n- You know, so. - So, and then all these new puzzles come up and you figure out ways to sell these puzzles.\n- Right. You go in and you say,\n\"Hey, I've got this loan. I need to get this loan\nif this guy's trying to buy this house and I need a loan that looks like this, where can we go? And by the way, they cannot, they cannot order a copy\nof his tax returns.\" So you don't want to have to\nsign what's called a 4506. So they're like, \"Oh, okay, listen, so and so's got a program that,\" da-da-da, you know, and you go back and forth, \"But you have to have\nthis much in reserves. But you got the bank, right?\" \"Yeah, yeah, I got the\nbank, I could do that.\" You know, so you go in and you throw it out\nthere to five or six guys and you're gonna come up with an answer. - So you're on probation\nhere just to self-reflect, did you start doing\nthis while on probation because of the money or\nbecause it gave you meaning? - God, I, you know, I mean\npart, a big part of that. The reason is, I did not want to move back in with my parents and I didn't want my father\nto see me struggling. And I didn't want him to, it was my success. He had no idea. My success had been the\nfirst time he'd ever really been proud of me. Does that make sense?\n- Financial success? - Yes.\n- At which point, when was the first time\nyou told him you did something and he was like, you\ncould sense him being proud? - Oh, when I became a mortgage broker, when I became a mortgage broker and I went to work for the company and we're talking about within a week, I got a client, three days later, I got a client, a week later, got a client, two days\nlater, got a client. Like, I closed four loans my first month. And my dad was like, well, \"How much money are you gonna make?\" \"And I'm like, oh, I'm\ncharging this much, this, I got a point on the back. I got this, I got boom. I'm thinking I'm gonna\nwalk home after taxes like 10, 11,000.\" \"Jesus, God almighty,\" you\nknow, \"Are you serious?\" \"Well, we'll see, don't\nstart counting your chickens before the, you know,\" and then, you know, two\nwhatever, three weeks later, four weeks later, you\nknow, boom, I got a check. It's like $9,000 or something. Or, and then, you know,\nthe next month it's 12 and the next month it's 16. And you know, then they make me a manager. And you know, it just,\n- He didn't know any, if it was illegitimate.\n- No, he thinks, he thinks, \"My son, he's brilliant,\" you know, \"He's great, he's wonderful.\" I had, you know, was\ncertainly not proud of me prior to that. But, you know, my dad was athletic. He was extremely bright. I mean brilliant. And I was a kid who had to\nbe put into special schools who barely graduated high school, who ended up going to college and getting a degree in fine arts because I was never gonna be able to get a degree in business. It wasn't gonna happen. So when I graduated college, I remember with the degree\nin fine arts, he said, \"The best, you'll, the best\nthing you could do with that is, maybe you could draw\ncaricatures at Disney World.\" You know what I'm saying? Which wasn't a compliment,\nbut it wasn't like, \"Hey, you could draw.\" So yeah, he, you know,\nand then I turned around and I tried to go to work\nfor State Farm Insurance, which is who he worked for. He worked for them for\nlike 40 something years. And I failed the aptitude test. So then I went and worked\nfor another insurance company and I was an insurance adjuster, but I couldn't keep up with the workload. And then I ended up working construction. I'm still barely paying\nmy bills, you know, and that's basically where\nmy dad felt like that's, you know, he was polite to me. You know, we was, we\nwere, you know, cordial. But yeah, I wasn't, I think he felt he\ndeserved a better kid, so. - Well when you, when you\nstarted doing mortgages, that's when he was like-\n- Of course he was like- - Oh, this kid's got something. - I'm driving, I'm driving a new, I got, I just pulled in a new car and I got a, I just bought\na house that was, you know, four or five blocks away from his house, from where I grew up, from where he lives, you know,\nlived at that time, you know, six blocks away from\nwhere my sister's married to her lawyer husband,\nlike I'm doing pretty good. And then within three\nmonths we bought, you know, my new wife, we buy a, a quadplex and then we're buying a\ntriplex and another quadplex and a 10 unit and then a duplex, and another duplex and a quadplex. And it's like, what the hell's going on? This guy is blowing up. He's going on vacation\nhere and vacation here. And you know, so he, you know, and so when the FBI comes\nin and they indict me, and I take the three years\nprobation, like, I mean probably the worst thing\nin the world, you know, other than going to prison\nwould've been just having to just sell everything and\ngo move in and start over and sell used cars. Not that there's anything\nwrong with selling used cars, but I just felt like, you know, I just didn't want to\ndisappoint him any more than I already had. So I thought, I'm gonna flip houses and then I'll start maybe\na development company. So I'll buy some vacant\nlots and all this and that. The problem is these houses,\nI'm buying for 50,000. If I fix them up and sell\nthem, maybe I make 20, 25,000. And then you gotta find\na qualified borrower. It's very hard to find\na qualified borrower that wants to live in Ybor City. Back then, it's, I still think it's rough, but those same houses are\ngoing for three and 400,000. So, you know, I'm buying houses, I gotta get qualified borrowers,\nI do all the renovations. It's a nightmare, you know? And if I, you know, looking\nback, it's like, okay, well then you gotta bite the bullet. It's just what you have to\ndo. I didn't want to do that. I didn't want to do it\nwhether it was laziness or I don't know, you know, I\njust thought I'm good at this. I'm gonna run, I'm just\ngonna start running a scam. I'm gonna figure out how\nto drive the prices up, buy the houses for 50,\nrecord them at 200,000, and then have these\nsynthetic identities buy all the properties, refinance\nthem, pull out the cash, make six months worth of payments, let them all go into foreclosure. And that really, really\nstarted working well. Very well. I had one time where I had a guy, it was James Red, the synthetic\nidentity was James Red. And he had bought two or three houses and there was somebody at\nthe office who was friends of somebody who knew the title company where we were closing the loans. And he called her, her name was Mary, and said, \"Mary, this guy James Red, like Cox is doing something shady. James Red doesn't even exist.\" She goes and looks at the\nfile, her last couple files, and she realizes, of course, obviously like this guy never showed up. She remembers Cox picked up the files, like, and he's saying he doesn't exist. So she freaks out. She\ncalls the mortgage broker. Mortgage broker calls me,\nmortgage broker calls me up and says, \"Listen, Mary said\nshe's not closing the next loan unless James Red shows up.\" And I went, \"Wow, that's a tough one.\" And she's like, \"Okay,\nso what do you wanna do? Do you wanna go to another title company?\" Like, we're supposed to\nclose in like three days, two, three days. And I said, well, I mean, he's\ngonna have to show up then. I said, I'm gonna, I'll figure it out. Like, gimme a couple days, gimme, lemme figure this out. And she's like, \"Okay, well, I don't know how that's gonna happen. He doesn't exist.\" Keep in mind at this\npoint, I don't need IDs. I don't need a real ID. I mean, I can, I figured out how to kind of make a real ID, right? Like I could make one,\nI could take sandpaper and sand off the\ninformation on a regular ID and then I would print\nthe corrected information in reverse on a piece of transparency and I would glue it over there and you could still see\nthe holograms and stuff. It actually worked pretty good. I don't, a cop's not gonna,\nit's not gonna pass muster with a cop, but somebody at\nthe bank, like I was able to go in and I would open\na bank account with it. Well, so, one of the things I had done when I was closing these loans was, I would go online and I would pick, you have to pick a photo\nof somebody, right? To put on the driver's license, right? So I'm not making a fake\nID for all these guys 'cause I don't need a fake\nID for all these guys. Not with my picture on it. But I need a fake, I need a copy of an ID, but I need a picture. Where do I get the picture? So I go to Hillsborough\nCounty's arrest website and I would find people that\nI knew that had been arrested. And so I found a guy named Eric Tomargo who had been arrested. He had like, I don't\nknow what it was, the DUI or domestic violence,\nI forget what it was, but there was a picture of him. So I print out the picture,\nI cut it up, I paste it onto a driver's license\nand I make a copy of it, you know, for James Red. That's what I'd been\ngiving the title people, when I would close, I'd\nsign all the documents and I'd leave them that copy so that it looked like\nthey made a copy of it. And then they would\nnotarize all the documents even though they'd never seen this person. They have a copy of his driver's license. Everything's signed. Cox\nsaid he signed it, it's good, notarized, here's your check. So what I do is I think, let me see if I can get Eric to do this. He's been to, I knew he'd\nbeen to prison before, so I call up Eric and I remember\none of my buddies, like, \"He's never gonna do this.\" And I was like, \"I think\nhe will. I think he will.\" So, and that's how, and that's really that kind of like, \"You\nthink, what do you think?\" \"No, let me try, lemme call him.\" \"I don't know, bro.\" Like, that's the kind of\nconversations you're having. Like, but really looking back, I'm still curious.\n- I would love to hear the opener few sentences\nthat you have with him. - I got, I can tell you\nexactly what I said, 'cause it's burned in my mind. He comes in, so what Eric\nwas doing at that time, he was actually working for us. He worked for somebody else,\nbut periodically we would, you know, we'd buy a house\nand we'd call him up. We'd say, \"Hey, can\nyou, you and your boss, can you guys come over and\ntrim the trees of this house? Trim all the trees, take all the crap in the yard, clean it up.\" They go, \"Yeah, sure, no problem.\" 'Cause that's what he did, worked for like a handyman service. So they would come and they'd clean it up and they'd do that. So I say, \"Can you come over?\"\nAnd he goes like, \"Yeah.\" So he comes to the office,\nwhatever, a few hours later and he comes in the conference room. I said, \"Hey Eric, what's going on?\" And he says, \"Hey, you\nknow, how's it going?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" I said, \"Listen,\" I said, \"I'm gonna tell you something. I need a favor.\" He's like, \"Okay, cool.\" He's like, \"What is it?\" I said, \"You know all these houses we've been having you go and clean up?\" He's like, \"Yeah, we had that. You had, you painted that\none house, you did this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know.\" \"Right, so here's what we've been doing. I've been buying these houses for $50,000, recording them for 200, and then I have these\nfake people buy them.\" And I explain, I just lay it out for him. And he's like, \"Wow, that's,\" he's like, \"That's, fuck it bro,\nthat's ingenious, man. That's some, that's\nsmart. Like, wow, woo.\" And you know, I was like, \"Okay,\" I said, \"Yeah,\nI know, that's great. So here's the thing.\" I said, \"The title company\nwho's been closing some of these loans and we have\na closing in a couple days, she wants this guy, James Red, to show up and I need someone to\nshow up as James Red.\" And he goes, \"Wow.\" He goes, \"Who are you\ngonna get to do that?\" And I was just thinking, I was just like, you're not understanding,\nI'm not confiding in you, 'cause I need a friend, you know? So, and I looked at him, I said, \"Well, I was thinking you might do it.\" He was like, \"Whew,\" he\nsays, \"That's a big favor.\" I said, \"It is a big favor.\" \"I could be in a lot of trouble.\" And I said, \"I know.\" And he goes, \"Well, whoa, wait a minute.\" He goes, \"I can't go.\" He said, \"You have to give\nthese people a driver's license. You said the driver's licenses, you were using mugshots. You said she's closed a couple of these. She already, she's seen\nthis guy's picture.\" And I go, \"She has seen this picture.\" I said, \"The thing is for\nJames Red, I pulled the mugshot offline of you when you were\narrested a couple years ago.\" And he jumps up and he\ngoes, \"You motherfucker!\" And I go, \"Whoa, whoa,\nwhoa,\" I said, \"Eric,\" I said, \"Wait a minute.\" I said, \"Hold on, hold on.\" I said, \"Listen,\" I said, \"I\nonly did that because I knew if it came down to this moment, you were the only person that I knew that could pull this off, that'd have the balls\nto walk in and do it.\" And he sat there and he went, \"Yeah, you're right, you're right.\" And I mean, well, I\ncouldn't believe he fell. Listen, this guy would\nbeat the brakes off me. He was, he's like 510, 511. He's boxed. He's a big guy.\n- Yeah. - So, you know, it's like I've weathered\nthat part of the storm. And he sat there and he\ngoes, \"Right, right.\" And he goes, \"Well I'm\nnot doing it for free, I'm not doing it for nothing.\" I said, \"No, bro, of course not.\" I mean, you know, what he's like, \"You're making a lot of money.\" I said, \"Well, keep in mind\na lot of that money goes back in the property, it's not\nlike we're walking away with, you know,\" I think I\nsaid like tens of thousands, we're really walking away\nwith hundreds of thousands. \"It's not like we're walking\naway with a bunch of money or, you know, it's, you\nknow, we gotta put it, we gotta buy more properties,\nwe gotta keep it going. We gotta make the payments.\" \"Oh, I know, but still, I\ncould get in a lot of trouble.\" I said, \"I understand, bro.\" I go, \"Well, what do you want?\" And I remember thinking\nif he asked for more than like 10 or 15,000, like\nI'll just, I'll do it myself. We'll just change title\ncompanies and we'll go and I'll do it myself. And he sat there and he went, \"I want $500.\" And I went, \"$500?\" Listen,\nI almost started laughing. I mean, I was like, I put my hand over my, I was like, \"$500?\"\n- Yeah. - It's gonna take you 30 minutes. And he's like, \"I don't care, bro. I could get in a lot of trouble.\" I was like, \"Oh, well yeah,\nI'm not paying you now. You gotta sign first.\" And he's like, \"Oh, you\nknow, I'll sign, I'll sign. I know you're good for\nit, I know you're good.\" Bro, he did it for 500 bucks, I made a fake ID for him. He goes in to the place,\nhe signs \"James Red.\" Comes out. What was even, you know\nwhat was funny about that? Was when we walked into the title company, we're sitting in the lobby and Mary comes walking\nout, she looks at me and she goes, \"Mr. Cox, I\ndon't know why you're here.\" She goes, \"I told Kelly,\"\nthat was the broker. She goes, \"I told the broker\nthat I'm not closing the loan unless James Red shows up,\"\nand Eric stands up on cue, and he goes, \"I'm James Red.\" And she was like, and she\ngoes, \"Hold on a second.\" She runs in the back, comes\nback with a file, opens it up, looks at the picture, and\nshe's like, \"Oh, I'm so sorry. Give me five minutes.\nI've got the file, I.\" Prints up the docs, he goes\nin, signs and when we're there, she's passing out the checks. 5,000 here, 25,000 here, 35,000 here, 7,000 here, 6,000 here. So he sees all these checks and I'm like, \"Oh, I got that, I and the construction company. No, no, no, I have that. I'll take care of that.\nI'll take care of that. So I get all the checks and I leave. We go sit in my Audi and he sits down and he is like, \"Bro,\nit's a lot of money.\" \"A lot of that money goes back\ninto the properties, Eric.\" And he is like, \"Ah, still bro.\" And I said, and I counted out 500 bucks. But listen, a week later\nwe had another closing. So he comes in, I said, \"Hey bro,\" he said, \"Hey, what's going on?\" And I said, \"I need you to\ndo the James red thing.\" He goes, \"Yeah, I've\nbeen thinking about that. I did that way too cheap.\" I said, \"I get it man,\nwell how much do you want? What do you want?\" And I'm thinking, if\nit's more than 10 or 15, I'll do it myself. And he sits there and he\ngoes, \"I want $1,000.\" I go \"$1,000?\" Like, oh, like, oh my God. So I gave him $1,000 and he did another one. And, but by that point it was like five or six, we'd done five\nor six with that guy. And after five or six plus the\ncredit cards, plus, you know, all the other things, like their credit scores start dropping. And you know, if it was 700,\nnow it's down to like 600 and at 600 you couldn't really borrow enough to make it worth it. It's like, and I have other\npeople in the wings waiting. So, you know, we would just, I'd go out and I'd run up the credit cards and pull as much money, pull\nall the money outta the banks and close the accounts\nand then stop paying. - And you said a lot of people knew. - Yeah.\n- So he was one of the people and then-\n- He was one of the people. - Why do you think nobody said anything? - I, well, I mean, I think\neverybody was making money. The appraiser at that\ntime, I had an appraiser. Eventually I order the appraisal software and I just start doing\nthe appraisals myself. Like, why give this guy 500 bucks? So.\n- So you were doing the appraisal yourself, - Bro, I'm doing it.\n- How's that possible? How's that? Is there a check against the, is there- - There is. It's just funny, nobody\never questions that. You actually have to have a license to get the appraisal software. So I get an appraiser's\nthat we're working with, I get her license and I create an email address as her. - Ah, so it was a synthetic appraiser. - Right, it was a real person. But I end up ordering the\nappraisal software by emailing, it was called Alamo,\nAlamo Appraisal Software. So I end up emailing them as her and they go, \"Well, we can't give you, we can't sell you the software unless we, we need a\ncopy of your license.\" Boom, here's your license. So I send her the, I send them the license and then we pay for it with a credit card. You know, you could go\nget like a green dot card, you go put 500 bucks on it or 1,000. The software was like\n1500 bucks or something. So you pick them like back then, you know, it was a long time ago. So 1500 bucks, they mail it to us and now I've got the software. So now I can, you know, I\ncan do the appraisals myself. - What stops you from appraising it not for 200,000, but even more? - There's no comparable sales. So no matter what you sent to the bank, they're gonna look at it. Like they're gonna have a, their in-house appraiser is\ngoing to do a desktop review. He's gonna go online, he is gonna check to make sure all the appraise,\nall of the comparable sales are sold for what you said they sold for, are the same square footage, were built, what the pictures look like,\nwhere, how far they are, he's gonna double check everything, but you know, he's some\nguy who's on salary and he does, you know, whatever, 40 or 50 of these a day or something. It doesn't take him long.\nAnd so it's cheaper that way where we pay for the appraiser,\nappraisals, the whole thing. - Got it. So everybody's getting paid. - Right. And so at this\npoint, I'm doing that, right? You know, and I'm getting\ncaught periodically. - Can you give an example? What\ndo you mean getting caught? - I'm living in Tampa Heights, which is right next to\nYbor City in Tampa, right? So this is all, these are\nall like little suburbs of Tampa and they're all built\nback in the 1920s, right. 1890s, 1910, 1920. So I've bought this eight unit building. I renovated it into a triplex. I mean, I'm driving an\nAudi, I'm dating a woman that I should not have been dating. Like, I mean, I don't know\nwhat she was thinking. So I'm, you know, you're\ngoing on vacations, like everything, life's good. So, but every once in a\nwhile, you know, like where, you know where things\nhappen, you get a phone call, \"Hey, this is what just happened.\" And one time I got a phone\ncall from same broker, Kelly. Kelly called me up and said,\n\"Listen, we got a problem.\" This was, I wanna say this was Allen Duncan. This was one of the first\nones that I had done, right? But we used him, but, and so he, so she calls me up and says, \"Listen, Allen Duncan never made his\nfirst mortgage payment.\" And I had a friend of mine, or one of my co-defendants when we closed on that loan, we both got checks for\nwhatever, 40 or 50 grand. Keep in mind, we're also buying, some of this money's going\ninto a business account. We're buying property, we're buying, so it's not like I'm pocketing\nhundreds of thousands of dollars, or even, you know, even 20 or $30,000 on every closing. I'm more like, I'm getting 25, 10, 20, and this guy's getting 10\nand this guy's getting 15, and then we're taking 60 and we're putting it into\nthe business account. We're buying a bunch of vacant lots, or we're building some new houses. So we're trying to kind of take all this and turn it into a development company, but we still have to pay our bills. So, you know, my buddy's\ngotta go to, he's gotta go to Amsterdam at least\nfor two weeks, you know. - Right.\n- He's from Belgium. That's you, apparently you have to do that at least once a year. So so when I gave him\nhis check, the check, I said, \"Look, you're gonna make the pay, here's the like 20 grand or 15 grand, but you gotta make the\npayments on this thing for the next six months.\" He goes, \"No problem.\" I said, \"Okay.\" So she calls me up a\nmonth and a half later and says, \"Hey, Allen Duncan did not, did not make his first payment.\" And I went, \"Oh my God.\" And he was actually renting the apartment downstairs from me. So I run downstairs and I open the door and I go, \"Bro,\" I'm like, \"Did\nyou make Duncan's payment?\" And he turns around and\nhe is like, \"Is it due?\" And I was like, \"Oh my God.\" So I run back, you know,\nI grabbed the phone. I'm like, \"He didn't make\nit. He didn't make it.\" She's like, \"Okay, well\nhere's what's happening. The account executive is\ncalling. They've got the file.\" And it was called, it was South Star Bank. \"South Star Bank has it. They reviewed it. They've already been ordering documents. they're saying that this\nguy, there's a problem. They are, it's it's falling apart. Like the whole thing's falling. They know something's wrong.\" - But they don't know exactly what, it's just something suspicious or what? - That she didn't tell\nme that on the phone. - Okay.\n- Like she's saying there's something wrong,\nthey're freaking out. - Yeah.\n- Because the account executive didn't really know. She just got a phone call saying, \"Hey, have you ever met this broker?\" Did she meet the guy? Who\nis the guy, he hasn't paid. \"We're calling the cell.\nNobody's answering.\" And really most of this\nwas my buddy Rudy's fault. He's just not doing any of this stuff, any of the things he's\nsupposed to be doing. So we go to the office and I call South Star\nBank, I get the secretary and I said, \"Look, I need to talk to\" whatever the guy, the big guy was. It was one of them was like the president and one was like the somebody else. Anyway, vice president. So I said, \"I need to talk to\nso-and-so the vice president.\" And she says, \"I'm sorry,\nhe's in a business meeting.\" I said, well, \"Listen, tell\nhim this is Allen Duncan, like you need to go tell him it's, Allen Duncan's on the phone right now. I assure you he wants to talk to me.\" And she's like, \"All right, hold on.\" And I mean, like 20\nseconds later, you know, speakerphone, \"Hey, Mr.\nDuncan, this is so and so, and you know, I'm here with our lawyer and the president of the\nbank and our head of fraud. We were just discussing you.\" And I was like, okay, I\nunderstand that you guys are, I haven't made my first payment.\" I said, \"It actually\ncame back in the mail. I had the wrong address.\nThat was completely my fault. And I apologize.\" I said, \"But I can get you\na cashier's check today. I will overnight it. No problem.\nHope that's gonna be okay.\" I said, they said, \"Way,\nwe're way past that, way past that.\" I said, \"Okay, well\nwhat's, what's the issue?\" And they were like, \"I\nmean, look, to be honest, I don't think I'm talking to Allen Duncan. I don't think there is an Allen Duncan.\" He's like, \"I mean, your Social Security number\nwas issued a couple years ago. We called the bank and this was, we had gone with like South\nor SunTrust Bank, right? So it was a real bank, so\nit wasn't our normal bank. And they called, they don't, they don't have any record of you.\" And I was like, \"Well,\nI've never been happy with South Star Bank there if, you know, it sounds like a banking error.\" And they're, and they're like, \"Yeah, I don't think, this isn't cute.\" - He says, \"I don't think I'm talking to Allen Duncan right now.\" - Right.\n- And you were- - Terrified.\n- You're just. - Terrified, I'm not.\n- But you have to be playing it cool I guess. - I mean, I know, what am I gonna say? No, you're talking to Matt\nCox. Like, I can't say that. Like, I'm just gotta keep running with it. Just like, okay, well look, you know, and he's like, you know, \"We\ncalled the DMV, this, you know, they don't have a list\nof you in the, you know, in their website. We think that the, you know,\nwe don't think you exist. You know, we're still\nwaiting for a phone call back from who, so and so and so and so and so,\" and I'm just like, \"Oh my God.\" And I said, \"Have you called, have you called the authorities yet?\" And they were like, \"No, we haven't. But once we put our\nfile together, we will.\" And then the head of the\nfraud department, they said, \"Oh, by the way, Mr.\" I forget his name, \"But the head of the fraud department, the head worked for the\nFBI for like 10 years or something, or 12 years.\" And so I mean, I'm just like, and by the way, the broker is there, and my buddy Rudy is there. And I mean, there, he's pacing the room. She's in tears crying. Like they're, and I'm\nlike, \"Okay, well fellas,\" I say, \"Where's this headed? Where's this going? What are we doing?\" And so they're kind of\nchuckling and joking about it. And I remember being like,\nthinking, what's the deal? Like, it's weird. And I said, \"Look, well, why don't I just, lemme just pay you back.\" They said, \"Ah, we'll get the money. We're not worried about it,\" I\nsaid, \"You don't seem worried about the money, about\ngetting any of the money back. Like, don't, why don't you just let me, I'll cut you a check. I can get you the money back. Like what do I,\" I owed\nhim like 150 or something. I forget exactly. It was nothing. I'm like, \"I owe you 150,000, lemme cut your check for 150,000.\" And they were like, \"No,\nno, you know, that's, we'll get the money back when\nwe foreclose on the property.\" And that's when I was like, \"Oh, they think the property's worth\nlike $195,000 or something.\" And I went, \"Oh, I said, I understand. Okay, so do you have the\nappraisal in front of you?\" And they were like, \"Yeah.\" And I said, \"Open it up.\" I said, 'Take a look at comp number one. That's owned by a guy\nnamed, you know, Lee Black. Comp number two, you know, is\nowned by, you know, whatever, David Silver, whatever the names were.\" And I'm like, \"You know,\nlike Black, Silver, Red. I said, I am all those people.\" And I said, \"Lemme tell\nyou what I've done.\" And I tell them, just lay it out. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I said, \"So you can call the FBI, but you're not gonna\nget all your money back. Or you could let me\ngive you your money back and we can let this, we\ncan let sleeping dogs lie. The whole thing goes away, I apologize. You know, I had every intention\nof making all the payments. It's a glitch. You caught me. No, my bad.\" And so these guys are\njust like, \"Oh my God.\" Like now they're, they put me on hold, they're looking through the file. They come back and I remember\nat some point we go back, forth, back and forth and\nfinally they come back and they said, \"Listen,\nyou still have the money?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" Well first they come\nback, they threaten me. \"Oh well when we give this to the FBI, you're,\" and I said, \"That's not true.\" I said, 'The money was\ndeposited into a bank account. It has since been moved. The bank account has been closed,\nit's been removed in cash. That money is gone. You\nwill never see that money. I will be cutting you if\nI pay you back at all, it'll be from another account.\" And so the FBI agent ends\nup saying, \"He's right. Even if we caught him red\nhanded, the likelihood that any of these funds will be\never be recouped is zero. Like, there's almost no\nmoney's ever recouped.\" And so we end up, they\nput me on hold again. They come back and they go, \"How quickly can you get\nus a cashier's check?\" And I go, and like, that day I go get them a cashier's check overnight, the cashier's check. They never called the FBI,\nthey never did anything. Now, at that point, we\nactually ditched that whole, that James or Allen Duncan. I remember at that point\nwe went to the mall, ran up all the credit cards\nand just threw everything away and walked away because it was shot. You know, that whole, that guy was shot. I think we borrowed whatever, $800,000 or 900,000 in his name. - So with the banks, it's really, really all about the money. - That, listen, when I go on the run, I got one where I was caught\nso red-handed, it's insane how bad it was. And listen, that's nothing. I got caught by Washington\nMutual one time. I was caught by Washington\nMutual, where we had done six owner occupied duplexes. So if you say you're\ngonna live in a house, you can get about 95% financing. But if it's an investment\nproperty, you gotta put down 20%. You get about 80% financing. So a buddy of mine who\nwas a sheriff's deputy, we had his wife buy, I'm gonna say six owner occupied duplexes, saying she lived in\nevery single one of them. Well, you can't own or\noccupy six dwellings. Like, that's fraud. Now granted, her W-2s and\npay stubs were correct, but she didn't put the down payments down. Even the down payments we didn't put down, we actually got cash back. But months later, a lawyer from Washington Mutual ends up calling the mortgage broker and saying that they ended up with two of the owner occupied duplexes because Washington\nMutual had a credit line extended to one of the\nlenders who'd lent the money. So it actually was Washington Mutual. So it was a couple months\nlater when they went to sell it in a, you know, they package\nthem together and sell them. They realized we have the same\ncustomer with two duplexes, side by side, both owner occupied. This is fraud. So she comes in, she tells me, \"Oh my gosh, this lawyer's on the phone. This is what happened.\" I'm like, \"Oh wow, this is horrible.\" I end up getting on the phone with him. We have a huge, we have a conversation. And I'm like, you know, he's like, \"Look, you know, this is a big deal. We could call the FBI.\" I am like, \"Look, who knows\nwho was involved in this. Maybe somebody on your side was involved. Maybe somebody on my side. I don't know what my mortgage broker did. I'll deal with her on my own. Why don't you just let us\nrefinance the properties?\" Not only did we talk him into allowing us to refinance the properties,\nhe gave us a reduced, a reduced balance of what we owed him because we couldn't borrow\nenough to pay him off. So they took like a $20,000 hit just to refinance those properties. Never called the FBI, never did any, we was absolutely fraud. Yeah, I had a broker\none time we got caught with over a million dollars in loans that he had done that were fraudulent. Pinnacle Bancorp, which\nwas out of a Chicago. The owner called me and he was like, \"Look, your\nmortgage broker did this.\" Like, there was a bunch\nof canceled checks. They were fake canceled checks. So they looked like they\nhad run through the bank for somebody's rent, but they hadn't. Does that make sense? - Yeah.\n- Like you pay your rent, they deposit it, it goes to the bank and they've got all the\nnumbers and everything. Well, I had a bunch that were blank that all you had to do was sign, fill out your borrower's information, and then you cut and pasted\nhis name and his address at the upper left hand corner. You make a copy of it, it\nlooks like canceled checks. We had 24 of them. Well, one of my brokers was\nusing them for all of his files. Like even if the person\nreally had a rental history, he didn't wanna order it, he\njust did this, it was easier. - It's faster, yeah.\n- Yeah. Just an idiot. - Wow.\n- So they catch $1 million worth of loans. They call me up and then they\ncaught another $1 million but they had already sold\nthem to Household Bank. So while I'm on the phone with the owner, his name's Gary, and we're talking, he's like, \"Look, this is what we found. This is this, this is what happened.\" And I remember I said, \"Gary, at the end of this conversation, if you think I'm cutting\nyou a check for $1 million, I said, I just don't have it. I don't have it.\" And this was when I owned\nthe mortgage company. And he says, \"No, I, what\nI'm asking you for your word that if any of these come back\non us, they're in Florida, they're in your area,\nyou'll help us get rid of the properties, we'll foreclose. We're gonna have to resell them. I don't wanna be flying down there. Just help us get rid of them.\" I said, \"Absolutely,\nof course, no problem.\" I said, \"What about the,\" I said, \"Well, what are\nyou gonna do with them?\" He goes, \"Well, they're\ngonna be a part of a package, like a $3 million package we're\nselling to Household Bank. The other ones they had\ncaught had already been sold. The ethical thing to do is to contact Household Bank,\nsay, \"We'll buy those back. We are gonna take care of.\" It's not what happened. In fact, Gary flew down\na couple weeks later, took me and several of the\nbrokers, not that broker, but several of the brokers out\nto dinner, had a few drinks and he openly admitted, he's\nlike, \"Look, I don't care if all the loans have fraud in them, as long as they don't come back on me. That's what I'm concerned about.\" 'Cause there's a clawback\nclause for one year. He's like, \"So if they can perform for one year, I don't care.\" That was it. - How many people in the industry do you think are operating like this? And by like this, I mean, in\nthe aforementioned gray area. - I would say there's\nprobably after like the, like after the 2008 financial crisis, I would say it cleaned up considerably. But I would say at this point it's just as bad as it ever was. And keep in mind these, a lot of the loans that caused the problems\nwere like, you know, they called them liar loans or you know, no qualification like,\nno qual loans, right? No income. Well, those loans are, they exist again, like there are subprime companies\nthat are doing that again. They don't, I don't think they\ncall them subprime anymore. They call them, so they\ngot some other name. - Yeah. Rebranded.\n- Yeah, they've rebranded a little bit, but it's\nhappening all over again. - It just seems the whole, the whole real estate\nslash banking system is very prone to this kind of corruption. - I mean, but how can you fix it? Like, a lot of the things, they fixed, a lot of the manipulation they fixed. But if you tighten it too much, then the average person can't get a loan. You know, and the thing is, some of these loans\nsometimes changing a W-2, you know, should that person\nhave gotten into that house? No, he shouldn't have. He didn't qualify. But he makes all of his payments. So it's like, is it a fraudulent loan? Yeah, but it performs. So, you know, I think\nthat, I would say that, I forget what the FBI statistic was. It was like 20% or 30% prior to the two thou prior to the financial crisis,\nit was like 20 or 30% of like bank loans they were saying that contains some kind of fraud, even if it was just a lie. You know, if you want\nto cut 30% out of the, you know that's a ton, that's a ton. - So you're on probation and you're doing these,\nyou're almost getting caught. You are almost getting caught. And you're doing these\nreally large scale scams. How does it get to the point\nwhere you're on the run? - So I'm doing multiple scams, right? So it's not just that I'm doing the scams with the \"Reservoir Dog\" scams, right? I'm not just doing those guys. - Yeah.\n- I'm also creating other identities because\nI've got other people that are involved. They want to do a scam. So this chick I was dating. She wanted to run a scam. So I set up a scam. It's semi complicated,\nbut the bottom line is she ends up stealing a real person. We steal a real person's identity. I have a real person's identity. We get a driver's license in her name, open up some bank\naccounts, go rent a piece of property in her name,\nand I transfer the deed or the deed from the property\nout of the real owner's name. I transfer it into her stolen identity. We then refinance the house\nlike three or four times. And so she starts going to\nthese different closings and she's, her name is Alison. And she's pretending to\nbe a Puerto Rican woman named Rosie Duprez. Alison has brown hair and blue eyes. Rosie Duprez clearly doesn't.\n- Yeah. - So Alison, when we make the\nID, she dyes her hair black, curls it a little bit and gets the pictures taken of herself. But before she goes to the\nfirst closing to get a check for like $100,000, we've got like three of these scheduled. She changes her hair color. Like she dyes it back like a dirty blonde. And she goes to the first closing and she gets a check, a\ncheck for 100,000 let's say, I don't know what it was, like 95 or 105, whatever, roughly $100,000. She gets a check at the\nclosing, they give it to her. We then go to the next closing. Well, at the next closing, the title person has her\nsign all the documents. But she's looking at her\nlike, something's not right. Looks at her ID, makes a\ncopy of the ID, looks at it and says, \"This doesn't look like you.\" And she's like, you know,\n\"You don't look Hispanic.\" And she's like, \"I'm half Hispanic. What, what do you, what?\" And she's like, \"You don't, I mean,\" but keep in mind the photograph was her. So she's saying, \"This\ndoesn't look like you,\" but it's her, granted she\nhad, you know, the curly hair a little bit, but that's it. So Alison is like, \"It's me.\" And she's like, \"Look, I'm\nnot gonna give, cut you. I'm not gonna give you the check.\" I'm gonna, let's just sign the documents. You know, we can get,\nyou can get the check. I'll let you know.\" So she goes, gets in my car. She said, \"Yeah, listen,\nthere's a problem.\" So we're driving down the\nroad, she explains it to me, I realize, you know, okay, that's done. It's over. We're not going back. She's like, \"What about\nthe other closing?\" \"No, no, no more closings. We're done.\" And you know, and it was\nprobably more of a yell, screaming and yelling. Like, \"What the hell did you do? I told you not to change your hair. Why would you change your hair?\" Like that, when she came\nin like, the day before. And I was like, \"What did\nyou do? What did you do?\" And she's like, \"I changed my hair. What's the big deal? It's still me.\" Sure enough. You know, and that's\nlike, it's not that I knew that that was gonna\nhappen, but why tempt fate? - How'd you meet Alison? Like, what was-\n- She was a mortgage broker. - Oh, okay.\n- And I had done some fraudulent, she needed, she worked for another mortgage company. Sorry, she worked for\nanother mortgage company. She couldn't get a loan closed. The owner of that\nmortgage company called me and said, \"Look, we got a\nloan, we need it closed.\" And I said, \"Great.\" And I, when guys would call me, I'd say, \"Great, I'll come pick it up. I'll give you a $300 or\na $500 referral fee.\" \"No, no, it's a couple\nhundred thousand dollars. We want to close it.\" \"Well, if you, then close it.\" \"Well, I can't close it. We need a W-2 or we\nneed this, we need that. We can't figure out how to do it.\" So I go over there and typically I convince\nthem, just give it to me, or it's not gonna close. She was, you'd have to see this chick. She was gorgeous. She was gorgeous. Very flirtatious. Made me feel like I was thin and handsome. So like, she gets whatever she wants. - Yeah.\n- So I'm like, \"Okay, look, here's what you do.\" And I explained to her,\ndo this, do this, do this. Send it here, it'll close. And we closed it. Well, then she starts calling me, right? \"Hey, how's it going?\" We go to lunch, next thing you know, we start sleeping together. She realizes what's happening. She says, \"I want in on this.\"\" So now we do the closings. We're on our way. I say, \"Look, that check's dead.\" She goes, 'What about the\nother, the other one?\" I go, \"No, no, it's all\ndead. We're walking away.\" Now, it was easy for me to say, because for me, I had money. She's going through a\ndivorce, she's broke. You know, like, none of this\ndid I take into consideration at the time, by the way, to me it's like, nah,\nthat's dead, we're done. We'll start over again. Well, and she's, to her, in her\nmind, she was about to make, we were getting probably that\nwas a million dollar scam. She was about to end up getting,\nyou know, whatever it was, half or one third of half a million\ndollars in the next week. Now she's got nothing. So, she says, \"Look, let's\nat least cash this one.\" And I had a buddy named Travis Hayes who had been, you know, we actually were, we've been friends since high school. We were like best friends, right? Really close friends in high school. We were still close. Travis was running a scam. This one, hers was in\nClearwater, his was in Orlando. So I'm all, I'm getting all over the state at this point, right? So he's running an Orlando scam that's already yielded\nhalf a million, maybe more. He's still pulling, we're still refinancing properties, right? So he's about to close on another half a million\ndollars worth of properties. He's got a bank account that's open. She says, \"Let's give it to Travis, have him deposit it in his account.\" He's already pulled out like\n300,000 out of the account. And she's like, \"Shouldn't be a problem.\" I was like, \"No, no, no.\" And\nshe goes, \"Let me call him.\" She calls him, I think I called him. And, and I explained the situation. He said, \"You think it's okay?\" And I said, \"No, I don't think it's okay. I don't think it's okay at all.\" And he's like, \"No, it's not a big deal. Just gimme the check.\" So I give him the check, he\ngoes, he deposits the check. They say they're gonna\nhold it till it clears. You know, that was kind\nof a thing back then. It takes, I don't know, I don't know how long it took. Five days, six days, whatever\nit was, he was supposed to go back and it would've cleared. And he would've been able\nto start pulling money out. And so I call him one day,\n'cause Alison's bugging me. So I call him and I go,\n\"Hey, where are you at?\" He goes, \"I'm actually\non my way to Orlando.\" And I said, \"Oh, okay, so you,\" \"But let Alison know I'm\nnot getting any money.\" He said, \"The bank manager called and said that because the check was over $100,000, they have to witness me\nendorsing the back of the check.\" Or they had to see my something, right? And for me to come in,\nI'm like, \"Whoa, whoa.\" I said, \"Something's\nwrong. Something's wrong. Don't go to the bank.\" \"What do you think's wrong?\" I go, \"I think the cops\nare waiting for you. That's what I think's wrong.\" And he goes, \"No, the cops aren't.\" He goes, \"Man, I'm in the\nparking lot right now. I just pulled into the\nparking lot. There's no cops.\" I'm like, \"They're not\ngonna be in squad cars.\" Like, and he's like,\n\"No.\" He said, \"It's fine. You're overreacting, bro.\" And I'll never forget what he said. He said, \"You're shaking like\na little girl, bro. Calm down. I got this. I'm cool with the manager.\" Like the manager, like, because you've chopped\nit up with the manager, he's gonna let your\nfraudulent check go through. So he walks in, the cops are\nin there, they locked the door. He just told me later, you\nknow, they closed the door, locked it, the cops are\nin there, they grab him and they bring him downtown. He didn't say anything. You\nknow, he won't say anything. That's not true, by the way. But he's, so here's what he told me. He wouldn't say anything. \"I told him, I ain't\ntalking to you, coppers.\" - Oh, he told.\n- Yeah. - [Lex] He told you, but\nhe actually did tell them. - He actually did talk to them. So, what he ends up doing, what ends up happening is we\ncan't get in touch with him. So we're calling and calling, calling. And then finally I decide, you know what, I'm not gonna call his cell phone anymore. I'm gonna call the name\nof the person he was, the synthetic identity's number, right? So I go and I call the\nsynthetic identity's number. I call and I say, somebody answers. And I go, \"Hey, is so-and-So there?\" And he said, and it's a\ngruff, authoritarian voice. You know, this is law enforcement. And he's like, \"No, who's this?\" He goes, \"No,\" he goes, \"No,\nthis is officer so-and-so who's this?\" And I go, I was like, \"This\nis Lee Black,\" I said. He said, he goes, \"How\ndo you know so-and-so?\" I was like, \"Oh, no, no,\"\nclick. And I just hung up. And I called from like a payphone. So I turned around and I\nsaid, \"He got arrested.\" And then later on that night, he showed up on the county website, you\nknow, the arrest website showing he had been arrested. And the next day he calls me and he asks me to get him outta jail. Like, \"Hey, I, you gotta go.\" So I have to give his\nbrother-in-law money, you know, we get him outta jail. He actually got out.\n- For bail? - Yeah, he got out for like nothing. And here's what I should have known. Like he was cooperating. It went from like $300,000\nbond down to like $10,000. So it's 1,000 bucks. So right then, I didn't know it at\nthe time, but obviously that means we're gonna let him outta jail. He's cooperating. So\nthey let him outta jail. I go and I get him a lawyer, a state, this was state by the\nway, it wasn't federal. So I get him a lawyer for like $15,000. He come, you know, he comes, you know, of course he tells me, \"Look, they asked me a bunch of questions. I told him that, you know, he made up some story about he's working with another guy, but he\ndoesn't know the guy's name. He made up a name. Like there's a whole, he\nhas this whole kind of thing where he tells them about me, but not me. And he's like, and the,\nyou know, the numbers, none of the numbers led anywhere. So they all lead to cell phones that are only being used for those scams. So it's a dead alley or blind alley. And I'm like, \"Okay, okay.\" And I'm mean, I'm paying him\nlike he's coming in, \"Man, my truck's no good. I need another truck.\"\nI buy him another truck. \"Hey man, my electric's\ngonna get turned off. And I don't have. Oh, I need $1,000.\" \"Of course. Here's $1,000. I don't know what I was, I'm\nembarrassed you had to ask, here's 1,000,\" you know? And a week later, you know,\nhe needs 2,000 for this, 1,000 for this, 2,000 for this. He wants to start a tree trimming company. He needs to buy a tree\ntrimmer. \"How much are those?\" \"5,000,\" of course, that's fine, 10.\" So I give him another 25,000, starts like a tree trimming business, which he runs to this day, what I don't know is that,\nyou know, the whole time he's actually working with a task\nforce that's been put together. - Federal, or?\n- This is state at this point. It's a state task force, 'cause there's multiple\ncounties involved at this point. And it wasn't hard for him to\nexplain like this comes back to \"Reservoir Dogs.\" I got a much, all he had\nto say to the officers was, \"Listen, you gotta let me go. I can't do any prison time. I'm gonna tell you about\na much, much bigger scam.\" And they go, \"Okay, well how\ncan you prove that scam?\" \"Pull up Hillsborough County, Hillsborough County's\ntax appraiser website. Okay, look up the name James Red. Look, all of these were\nbought six months ago. Six months later, they're\nall in foreclosure. Pull up Lee Black. All of these were bought. Look, six months later, all\nof them are foreclosure. Hey, pull up James Red. You know pull up Brandon Green, pull up.\" So all of these are going in foreclosed. I mean, it's so, it's like, you know, that what I thought was so cute, not cute. It was just stupid. And so he very quickly, they\nput together a task force. He's working with them on the task force. And, we're still buying houses, flipping houses, doing everything, 'cause I believe him. I believe he's not, you know, he's saying, \"Look, if I have to go to jail\nfor, you know, a year or so, like, you know, and he\nis also paying, you know, he hasn't paid them back yet. But we're saying he can pay them back. Like it's like, \"Look, if we\nget to the point, you know, when we get to that point,\nlike we'll pay them back,\" but we haven't paid him back yet, 'cause we have no way to show\nwhere that money came from. We can always go to like\none of his relatives and give his dad 40 grand, give his mom 20 grand, you\nknow, that kind of stuff. And start putting money that way. And all that money was\ntaken out in cash too. So we could always show up with\na chunk in cash regardless, you know, it's still in the process. And I think that we're\nstill in the process and it could be six months or a year away, 'cause it's a slow\nthing, I've already been through the process my\nfirst time when I got in trouble and it was a year. But from the time that I was spoken to until I pled guilty and was sentenced. So I'm not concerned about it. Well that's happening. We're still flipping properties. And one day, I have a buddy named Steve Sutton, remember, the sheriff's deputy. And keep in mind, it's funny because like I've done bad\nloans for police officers, sheriffs, lawyers, doctors,\nlike, you know, across, everybody across these\naren't like all, you know. - Yeah. Everybody.\n- Guys that, you know, these aren't all like, you\nknow, construction workers or guys that work in, you know,\nor mechanics or something. These are like the legitimate,\nthese are legitimate people that have credit problems\nor whatever the case may be. So one day I'm sitting at work and I'd been getting phone calls for the prior week from people\nat title companies saying, \"Hey, Matt, wanted to let you know we just had some subpoenas\nserved on several of your files.\" And I'm concerned, like\nthat had me concerned. Then a guy named Jeff Testerman\nstarts making phone calls. Jeff Testerman is a reporter\nfor the \"St. Petersburg Times.\" He's calling people saying, \"Hey, I know, noticed that\nyou sold a piece of property to Lee Black, have you\never met Mr. Black?\" He assumes like, and they're\nlike just hanging up on him or saying, \"No, I don't know\nwhat you're talking about. I'm not sure what that guy's\nname was. Lemme call you back.\" And I'm getting phone calls from people. So I know something's up\nwith the newspaper now, now I know something's being looked at, but nobody's really talking. I know that there are\nsubpoenas being served and I'm nervous, you\nknow, I'm very concerned. And then one day I'm in my office and the sheriff's deputy\nwalks in Steve Sutton in his uniform too, which\neverybody always stiffened, you know, when he would walk in. So he walks in, I go, \"Steve,\"\nI said, \"What's going on?\" He said, and usually he's\njolly and laughs and stuff. And he goes, and he says, \"I\ngotta talk to you outside.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" I\nwalk outside, \"What's up?\" And he says, \"I used to\ndate this girl in the like the Tampa Police\nDepartment or something, right?\" And I was like, \"Okay.\" He said, \"She showed up\nat my house this morning at like six o'clock in the morning.\" And I went, \"Okay.\" He said, \"She said that she's\nbeen working on a task force. And he said, apparently one\nof your buddies got arrested in Orlando, they're investigating some other thing in Clearwater. They're investigating a ton of properties here in Ybor, Tampa Heights. And I mean there's like a\nhundred properties involved. And my name came up because you've sold some\nproperties to me,\" which I had. And, and he is like, \"So she came to me and said, 'Look, your\nbuddy Cox,'\" he said, and I go, I was like, \"Okay.\" He goes, he said, \"Well,\nthe task force is on you. And she said to stop talking to you because they're gonna come\narrest you in a couple days. They just handed over\nthe task force findings to the FBI and the FBI is\ngoing to come arrest you in a couple days. And she said not to talk to you because you're going to cooperate and because all white\ncollar guys cooperate. So she thinks you're gonna cooperate and not to talk to you, 'cause she's afraid you're\ngonna get me hemmed up. And she said, just to walk away.\" And he was like, \"So I\nthought you should know.\" And I was like, \"Okay.\" And he said, \"What are you gonna do? I said, \"Oh, I'm, you know, I don't,\" well first he said, \"What should I do?\" And I go, \"Tell them,\ntell them that I arranged all the loans for you. You came in, you signed the paperwork, I filled out all the documents,\nyou signed the paperwork, you know, I arranged everything.\" I'm like, \"You're not a mortgage broker. You don't know if this is legit. Like you sign, you have perfect credit. You signed the paperwork, you walked away with a check for 30,000. You don't know.\"\n- Yep. - And he was like, 'cause he\ndidn't, 'cause he had a job. He was a sheriff's deputy. Like, I'm not a, you know. I went in, I applied for a loan at a bank. They said, \"We can buy,\nyou can buy the house and we'll give you $30,000.\" So of course I'm gonna do that. You know, that's not gonna happen. But he doesn't know and\nI said, \"Just tell them, yeah, tell him you'll\ncooperate like, absolutely.\" He goes, \"What are you\ngonna do? I said, \"Me?\" I said, \"I'm leaving, bro. I'm leaving.\" I said, \"I can't stay\nhere. I can't go to prison. Like, I was just sentenced. I'm on federal probation right now. Like, the judge isn't gonna be cool with me getting popped again. Like, I mean, I can't do it. Can't do it.\" I said, \"I'm leaving. Can't go to prison. I'm adorable, bro. Like, you know, I can't, I\nsaw \"Shawshank Redemption.\" I know what's gonna happen. I can't.\"\n- You're too good looking. - Yeah, I can't do that.\nThat's not gonna happen. Like, I can't, you know, I can't, I'm not gonna defend myself against a guy who's six foot three and tatted up. No, so, and you know, and I can't, I'm no benefit to a gang. Like, I'm not, I'm a\nnonviolent, you know, soft, white collar criminal. So I was just like, I was like, \"Yeah, I'm leaving, bro, I'm leaving.\" So I actually went home. Well actually, I was able to, I started cutting checks to people, right? So I cut checks to Alison, to Johnny, to like, everybody I could think of. Here's 5,000, here's 7,000, here's 8,000, here's six, here's nine. And had them going to all\nthese different bank accounts, pulling out cash. But this is like a\nThursday at four o'clock. So the next day they show up with cash, write some more checks, they go again. I get about 80 grand in\ncash. That's all I can get. I go home that night, I start packing my bags and I was dating this\nchick named Rebecca Hauck. We've been dating about a month. And she shows up at my house. You know, I hadn't returned\nour phone calls all day, and apparently we're supposed to go out and I'd forgotten about\nit, I had bigger issues. And so I'm packing a couple of\nduffle bags and she walks in and she's like, 'What's going on?\" I'm like, \"I'm leaving.\" \"Where are you going? I thought we were supposed\nto go out and such and do something tonight.\" I'm like, \"I'm leaving. It's over.\" And she says, \"What happened?\" And I tell her what happened,\nthis is what happened. She's like, \"Oh my God.\"\nLike she had no idea. - Oh, she had no idea about\nanything you were doing? - No, I barely knew her. Like, I mean, she's coming over two, three times a week for a month. Like, I've, you know, this isn't\nlove, this isn't, you know, this is a booty call. That's all it is, like, we're hanging out, we're having sex and that's it. I don't even know you, so, she suddenly just begs to come with me. \"You gotta bring me with you. You have to this, you have to that.\" I'm like, \"What are you talking about? Like, you've got a son, you have your mom lives here, your,\" and she's just in tears and crying. And she suddenly said, and this is what's so funny about it is that she had just moved\nfrom Vegas to St. Petersburg to work at the dog track,\nto work for a company that owned the dog track, right? The, a casino interest or a, yeah, like a gambling company. And she said, \"You don't\neven know why I'm here.\" I was like, \"Okay, why are you here?\" She said, \"I'm here because\nI was working for a law firm that worked for the casino\ncompany that I worked for.\" She said, I got caught\nembezzling like nothing. It was like 10 or $15,000 from my boss,\" because she had a gambling habit. And she said, \"He didn't call the police because we were sleeping together and he was afraid his\nwife would find out.\" She said, \"So instead, he banished me here to St. Pete. My son just came to live with me.\" He's been caught sneaking out because the father had raised him. He'd only been living with\nher since she got to Florida. And she's like, \"I was about,\nI was gonna send him back. He's failing school. He's smoking pot. He's been caught sneaking\nout after curfew.\" I'm like, \"Oh, okay. I didn't,\nI don't know any of this.\" She's like, \"He was going\nback in December,\" you know, or no, he was going back\nafter the school year, which would've been like, May. Okay, and I'm like, so where before five minutes earlier, I thought she was this sweet secretary, sweet innocent secretary\nand she's like, you know, \"I've been married three times. I am a gambler. I've claimed bankruptcy. I'm sleeping with my old boss.\" I got like, you know, she\nwent from this, you know, thieving, adulteress, you know, and I thought, these are\nall really beneficial to my, you know, my future plans. - Yeah.\n- You know, and I shouldn't have at that moment, you know, I was so just\nflipped out and concerned and up and leaving your life and everything you know, behind. That's terrifying. And you know, and so now you're alone in a strange place in a place you've- - Is that the first time you've\ndone something like that? Like leave to go on the road? - Yes, so I'd never just up and moved and keep in mind now, I can't call home. I can't, like, I'm leaving. There are things that I\nfeel like get you caught. And every, you know, I've\nwatched tons of these TV shows and, you know, there are certain\nthings that get you caught. And you know, one of them\nis keeping in contact with anybody in your old life. So I'm thinking that's not gonna happen. Like, I'm not contacting anybody. I'm leaving and that's it.\nThat didn't really happen. I kept in touch, I called my\nmom every once in a while, but I was like, \"Okay, that's cool.\" - Did the loneliness of\nthat hit you early on or no? Like the, as you were packing?\n- I never, I never did. Well- - You're leaving your life. I mean, there's a, it feels like a fundamental transition. - Oh, listen. You think? I mean, listen, not just that. Like, I'm leaving my son, I have a son and I am, you know, I\nwas leaving everything. I was just terrified of going to prison. And, you know, I mean, I don't know, it was just, it was just so stupid. It was just arrogance. And, you know, I should have stayed, like, I made things so much worse. But I also thought I'm smart. I can figure this out. Like\nI can change my identity. Blend in. I'll be fine. - Aren't you already, like, people know what your face looks like? - They do. They do. But I, one of the first things I did was I got plastic surgery. - [Lex] What kind of plastic surgery? - I've got a nose job. I got what they call a mini facelift. They go in through your back of your ears and they suck out all\nthe fat in your neck. - [Lex] Does that change appearance much? - A little bit. I got, I was balding. I got a two hair transplants,\nyou know, two hair grafts. So the hair in my head,\nthis isn't my hair, it's my hair, but it's from back here. So there's, they cut it from here and they.\n- It looks great. - I appreciate it. So they reimplanted it there,\nyou know, got liposuction, just some, you know, other stuff and, you know, got my teeth\ndone, that sort of thing, you know, so, you know, and\nthat was kind of like my plan. I'll go, I'll take off, I got 80 grand, I'll steal some more money, you know, but I let her come with me and we ran up all my credit\ncards over the next few days, packed up the car, traded in my Audi and got like an Audi, I\ndon't know, was it like an A6 or like a four door like the\nbig four door, whatever it was. Got that and drove straight to Atlanta. And, so I wrote a letter to my parents before I left, just explaining,\nthis is what's happening. I'm leaving, I'm done. I'm\nnot going to prison. Love you. Sorry.\n- Sorry. - Sorry, sorry, I know I'm a\ndisappointment. Sorry. Bam. So I take off, go to Atlanta. When we went to Atlanta,\nI already had the name of a guy named Scott Cugno that I'd done a loan for. So I had his, you know, his\nvital information, right? Like I have his name, date of\nbirth, Social Security number, mother's maiden name,\nand where he was born. One day we were having a conversation and I just slowly pried\nall that out of him, right? Like, I already, we'd done a loan for him. So already had his name, date of birth, Social Security number. But I need to steal his identity. I need to know where he was born and his mother's maiden name. So through the course of a\nconversation, I just pried, you know, hey, \"You know, Cugno is that, you know, what is that? Is that like Irish? Is it?\" \"No, it's such and such.\" \"Oh, what's your mom's name?\" \"Oh, such and such.\" \"Oh, okay.\" - Yeah.\n- You know? \"Oh, were you born here? Or you born in, weren't you from?\" \"No, man, I was born\nhere, I was born in such,\" \"Oh,\" Hillsborough County. You know, like, I, so it was no big deal. We get to Atlanta, I make\na fake ID for both of us, but keep in mind, I don't have, like, I don't have a driver's license. I do, but they're fake. Like, I can't give this to a cop. Can't give a driver's license\nthat says David Freeman. - What's David's residence?\nFlorida or is this Georgia? - No, this is Florida. Okay.\nBut it was just a made up name. - Okay.\n- I'd gone to like high school with a kid named David Freeman. So I had an ID, but I\ncan't give that to a cop. Like, that's enough to\nget like rent a place or do something or.\n- Yeah. - So we go, go to Atlanta, make an ID, set it up,\nmake some business cards, set up a couple websites,\nset up some, get a HQ, which is that like a,\nit's a company that will, you can do virtual, you can rent virtual, you can rent offices. And they'll answer your phone for like a hundred bucks a\nmonth and they'll forward them. So it seems like you have\nan office and they'll, you know, they give you a\nphone number that you call up and they say, you know,\n\"Hi, United Southern Bank,\" you know, and they'll answer\nthe phone and forward messages. So we get one of those, make\na business card for Becky, she rents a house from a\nguy named Michael Shanahan. So we rent Michael Shanahan's\nhouse, it's like $200,000, $200,000 house in Alpharetta. And I then go to Alabama, wait, I then order Scott\nCugno's birth certificate, Social Security card. I think I registered to vote in his name. And I made a lease agreement in his name and I think that's all I needed. And then I went to Alabama and got a driver's license in his name. So I went into the DMV, give\nthem all these documents and which are, almost all of them are real except for the lease. They said, \"Sit over there,\"\nI sit over there, I sit down, boom, 20 minutes later I\nhave a driver's license. It's, you know, it's 20 something\ndollars. It was nothing. So I get the driver's license. Now I'm driving this, I'm still\ndriving a car that, an Audi that is in the name of Matt Cox. So I parked that. I then go get Social Security to issue me a Social Security number in the name's Scott Cugno. And I then turn around\nand I go and I get a loan. You put down 20, 30%,\nthere's all these first time or first time buyers, 30% down, rent, get like a Honda or something. So now we're living in a house,\nwe've got some furniture, bedroom furniture and I go downtown, I pull the title to this guy,\nMichael Shanahan's house, and I go downtown and I\nsatisfy the loan on his house. So he had two loans with Bank of America. And so I create two satisfaction of loans from Bank of America. So Michael Shanahan owns a house in the name Michael Shanahan. He has one mortgage with Bank\nof America and a second one. When you pay your mortgage off the way public records knows\nit's paid off is they mail public records, a\nSatisfaction of Mortgage. It's a one page document\nand it's notarized. - [Lex] So you've got two of those. - I filled out two, I created two of them. I just ordered, you know,\nyou can do research. So when I went downtown, I researched Bank of America\nSatisfaction of Mortgages and you know, thousands show up. So I just grab a couple of them and now I know what the basic template is. They're all, and they're\nall different by the way. So it's, you know, it's not\nlike you even have to be that close, but whatever. I mimicked, some of them,\norder, I had a notary stamp. Not hard to get, you\nknow, you just, you go in and you go into three different, you know, office Depots and you say, \"Hey, I need a notary stamp.\" And you give them the information\nand you come back four day or whatever, a week later\nand they give it to you. So I've got these notary stamps. So I notarize the Satisfactions,\nI go downtown, I file them, boom, the mortgages are gone. Keep in mind, Bank of America, he's still paying the mortgages. They don't know that\nthey've been satisfied in public records. They're not notified. So those are gone, but it takes about a month\nor two for it to show up. Atlanta was that far behind. I think it was Fulton County,\nthey were just way behind. So we just kind of have to\ndick around for a while, right? So we're going on little\nvacations, we're going to New Orleans, we're\ngoing to different places as Scott Cugno, driving\na car as Scott Cugno. We open up several bank accounts, we have multiple bank accounts, and then we end up going to Vegas. And we don't get, we do go to Vegas. But what happened was\nwe were driving around and I remember thinking, telling her, I was like, you know, \"This is a problem. Like, we have to get real IDs, real driver's licenses. I mean, this is real, but\nthis is a real person too. And he may stumble across it.\" And so what I did was\nI started running ads in magazines saying, \"Home loans available, good\ncredit, bad credit, no problem. Call now, government loans,\"\nyou know, \"Government, you know, VA, FHA finance,\"\nyou know, whatever. \"Call this number.\" So people start calling and\nI'm getting their information. One of the guys I got was Michael Eckert. Yeah, I remember Michael\nEckert, poor Michael Eckert. I actually legally changed his name to Michael Johnson at one point, but at this point it\nwas just Michael Eckert. So I don't, I wanted to see, you know, I'm bored. I want to see what the process is. How much does it cost? Is this possible? Lemme see if I can change this guy's name. It was, it was 1500 bucks, I changed it. - Without him ever showing up anywhere. So you can fake-\n- Well, I have a driver's license in his name. - Right.\n- I am him. So he did show up. He showed up at the lawyer's office. He, so, you know.\n- Right. - So I'm, so I do that. I'm living in the house and\nwe're driving along one day and I'm saying, \"Man, we gotta\nget real, like these people that are calling, like that one guy, I get his information,\nbut during the course of taking the application,\nand I'm asking like these, these government survey\nquestions, at the very end, there's like 20 questions\nand I'm rambling them off. And at some point he was\nlike, he said he volunteered. Like I didn't, I never even asked anybody about criminal history. And he just, he ended up saying something, \"Well, I do have a\nfelony, does that matter?\" I mean, he's like, he was, \"I mean, it was a DUI, I've had a couple DUIs, but I got my license back.\" And that was part of the\nreason he had bad credit. And it was like, okay, no,\nnope, it doesn't matter. Don't worry. I'm thinking\nyou're not getting a loan. So this is, I'm just taking your, I'm just stealing from you,\nsharing your information. So I get all this\ninformation, I'm gathering it. And so one of the things I said to Becky while we are sitting\nat this stoplight is I'm like, \"We gotta get real\npeople's real information.\" And I said, \"Like for instance,\" I said, \"What if I steal somebody's identity? I get a driver's license in his name, four states from where he lives and he gets a DUI? I could get pulled over two years later and get arrested for a DUI\nthat he got in Florida.\" And she's like, \"Well, what\ndo you, what are you thinking? Are you thinking like criminals or are you thinking like, like prisoners, like mental patients?\" Like, and I went, \"I mean,\nI don't,\" and I looked over and there was a homeless\nguy holding a sign. And I went, \"Like that guy.\" And I'll never forget, she\ngoes, she says, \"The hobo?\" like, I don't know who calls them hobos. And she's like, \"The hobo?\"\nI said, \"Yes, that guy.\" I said, \"Hold on.\" Pulled over to a Subway, got out, she went inside to get Subway. I walk across the street,\npulled out like 20 bucks and I said, \"Hey bro, can I ask you some quick\nquestions real quick?\" He's like, \"Yeah, what's up?\" And I go, \"Here's 20\nbucks.\" I said, \"Listen.\" I said, \"When was the last time you were gainfully employed?\" He's like, \"Ah, whatever. 10 years.\" I'm like, \"Oh, okay, do you\nhave a criminal record?\" He's like, \"Ah, I've been arrested and misdemeanors like,\nyou know, vagrancy,\" and he names off some things, you know, drunk in public, whatever. And I was like, \"Are you on probation?\" He goes, \"I can't do probation. They don't give us probation.\nThey keep us for 90 days. They release us. Like they,\nthe judge knows I can't do, I'm not gonna show up for a probation.\" I'm like, \"Okay, do you\nhave a driver's license?\" He's like, \"Maybe, I don't think so. I think it's just,\" I go,\n\"Is it, did you get DUI?\" He's like, \"No, I think\nit's just expired.\" \"Do you have a driver's license with you?\" He's like, \"No, I got nothing.\" I'm like, \"Okay, well, you know,\" he told me he lived in\nlike a tent in the woods. And so I gave him like another 20 bucks, asked him a few more\nquestions and then, oh, and I remember in the middle\nof it, he said, he goes, \"What, are you taking\na survey or something?\" And I went, I remember thinking, I go and I think, I go, I kind of chuckle. I go, \"You get a lot of\nsurveyors out here?\" like that. And he goes, \"Yeah, and sometimes.\" And I was like, \"Really?\" He goes, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"Like, the,\" he\nsaid, \"People from like, you know, halfway houses\"\nand what did he say? \"Social workers and stuff. They'll come out and they'll, you know, they'll pass out stuff and they'll ask us questions and stuff.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, okay.\" And I was like, I thought\nthat's good to know. So I go back, I get, grab\nBecky and she's like, \"Oh,\" she's like, \"Did\nyou give him money?\" I said, \"I gave him like 40\nor 60 bucks or something.\" Forget what and she was like, \"That's, what a waste of\nmoney,\" I thought that was good. That was money well spent. I said, \"That guy's perfect.\" I said, \"That guy is, he's got everything. He has no way to be contacted. He has no documentation on him.\" I said, \"He's not gonna drive a car. He's not gonna get a DUI,\nhe has an expired license. I just have to get his license\nreinstated and I can be him.\" So I went home. I typed up a, what I called a federal statistical survey form. And I made a little thing.\nI mean, I went online. I mean, I'm always filling out federal documents as a mortgage broker. So it looked identical. I mean, I had like this little,\nlike the recycle symbol. And it was like, you know,\n\"Federal Form 17017,\" you know. And so I print out these forms. I get a clip, go buy a clipboard. I make a little a Salvation\nArmy ID, I pin it on me. And I go out and I start-\n- Doing surveys. - I start surveying homeless people. Don't judge me, bro. I was in a bad spot. I was in a bad spot. I see the\njudgment. I see the judgment. Let's maintain civility here. Like stay neutral. Stay neutral. - So these homeless\nguys, I mean, they have, they have a Social Security number. They have a birth certificate, I guess. I mean, they're a real person. - Right.\n- They're a real person with- - They're just not\nusing their real person. - Yeah, they're not\nactively, yeah, engaging with the economic system,\nthe financial system. They're not employed. They don't have housing, all that kind of. - They don't file taxes. They don't. So I, one of the questions\nI even asked the guy at the, one of the last questions,\nI said, \"Do you believe that you will be gainfully employed within the next two years?\" Every one of them said, no, no, no. So, you know, it was like, okay, they're not even, they're not even trying. And they all had alcohol problems or honestly, the few of them I talked to like was pretty clear. I mean, it takes literally five minutes, less than five minutes\nto fill out the form. And I filled it out for him, of course. But even filling it out in that brief, just asking questions back\nand forth, half of them, you could tell you've\ngot some mental illness, like something's not right with you. Like, these aren't guys\nthat are gonna go out and get, are going to get jobs. They're not cleaning up. So they were perfect for my purposes, as horrible\nas I know that sounds, so. - Do you feel bad about\nthis little small tangent? - No. Do I feel bad about it? - The homeless people in society are really, it's a difficult life. Like dealing with mental illness, dealing with drug addiction,\nall that kind of stuff. - I mean, listen, being in prison and then the kind, the people\nthat are in prison that, you know, are going to be homeless or have been homeless,\nor the mental illness that I've dealt with in halfway houses and even doing this, I don't know what you\ndo with these people. I don't even know that you house them. You can't necessarily\neven house them together. You know, they, they cause such problems. Like, I don't know what the solution is other than just kind of\nkeeping them fed maybe and keep them away from\nnormal people, you know, so they don't cause crime or whatever. I don't know about\nhousing them in one area. That seems like a mistake. Like there is absolutely no\ngood solution to that problem. None, because it's not like, \"Hey, if, if we gave you a house or we gave you job training and we gave you this,\"\nokay, you might get 5%. - Yeah.\n- 10. But most of them are on the street because they've just messed up\nover and over and over again. And they just kind of gave up. - But, you know, I guess\nwe still have to remember that they're human beings. I mean, we mentioned off\nMike \"Soft White Underbelly,\" and he highlights the humanity of people who've had\na real difficult life. He does it well. - He's, Mark Laita is\namazing. He's amazing. And one of the things he had\nsaid was like, these are, he was like, \"These are real people.\" And he's like, \"Their stories.\" He's like, \"They have stories\nand they need,\" you know, but if you also talk to\nMark, he'll tell you, you can't just, you can't give them money. You can't, like, you can't. Like, he's tried every\ntime he's reached out and tried to help these\nguys, put them in apartments, fed them, got them back on their feet, within six months they're back on, they're back on the\nstreet, I mean, it just, it just happens over\nand over and over again. I mean, I think the amount\nof money that would have to be dumped into correcting\nthat problem, I don't know. I mean, you can say, \"Well, yeah, but just, you know, you should do it because it's the right thing to do.\" I don't know who's paying for it. - It's complicated. But for your purpose, they\nhave a Social Security number. - [Matt] They got 20 bucks. They seemed very happy.\n- There you are with a clipboard, taking a survey. - Right, took a survey, went home, ordered their, and they, you know, of course they give me everything. Name, date of birth,\nSocial Security number, mother's maiden name,\nwhere they were born. Have they ever been in the armed services? Have they ever had a passport issued? What states have they\nhad identification in? Have they ever been arrested?\nThey ever been on probation? Have they ever claimed\nSocial Security Disability, SSI mean I had like 17 questions and it absolutely answered everything. What high school did you go to? 'Cause high school transcripts\nare great for documentation. A lot of times they'll ask\nyou for high school, you know, can you get us a copy of\nyour high school transcripts? Like, that's good to know. And I'm a big believer in overkill. So I mean, I ordered a ton of stuff. If I needed three things to get a driver's license\nin your name, right? You know, I'd come in with like six, 'cause what you do is you get\nin front of the guy at the DMV and you kind of fumble through like, \"Oh, I got this, what else do you need?\" You know, I know exactly what you need. But you know, they'll be like, \"Oh, was that high school transcript? Yeah, I'll take that, and what, oh, voter's registration card, gimme that. Yeah, that's, you're perfect. You're good. Sit down right over. There's it.\" You know.\n- Who is by the way, lurking in the shadows\ntrying to catch you? You've mentioned FBI, secret Service. - Oh yeah.\n- You mentioned, I think I've heard you\nmentioned US Marshals, which is interesting, cops\nin general, the police, CIA, I guess CIA is international only.\n- Yeah. - FBI is internal.\n- Yes. - Okay, well, so who is,\nwhen you're doing this, who are you afraid of? - So by the time I've gotten to Atlanta, within four or five days,\nthe FBI raided my office. I guess I kind of missed that. - Back in Florida.\n- Back in Florida, when I left and drove to Atlanta and left, remember the FBI was gonna\nshow up a few days later, they were gonna arrest me.\n- And they did. - They did. They showed up like I left on\na Sunday night or something. Because for some reason in\nmy stupid thought, I thought, well, they won't arrest me on the weekend. Like, they don't work on the weekends. So they came on like a,\nwhatever, it was like a Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday,\nlike within a few days, they come in the office,\nthey raid it, they're looking for me, but I'm gone. Nobody knows where I am. And so now I'm surveying the homeless guys and I turn around and I'm\nordering their documents. And as their documents\nare showing up, you know, I'm going to different\nstates and getting IDs, so I'm going to Florida. So over the course of\nthis whole thing, I've had 27 driver's licenses in\nlike seven different states. I've had two dozen passports. Because if you're gonna\nget the driver's license in the guy's name, you might as well get, or an ID even, you might\nas well get a passport. 'Cause a passport's not difficult to get, they don't fingerprint you,\nyou know, all they look, all they're doing is\nsaying, \"This is your ID and were you born here?\" And then they run a check\nand if it comes back or it doesn't, and back then\nyou could do it expedited. And I'd have it in like two weeks. Like now it takes like 90 days or 60 to 90 days to get one, but- - And if you have multiple\nideas for a single identity, that's more proof, like, right.\n- Right. - So wait, what number\ndid you say? How many? How many IDs, how many identities? - So I had, well I've\nhad over 50 identities. But I've had 27 driver's licenses issued from state DMVs, department\nof Motor Vehicles. - So, like, legitimately,\n- Legitimately, I walked into the DMV, said,\n\"Hi, my name's Michael Eckert, and I just moved here about\nthree weeks ago, four weeks ago. Here's my lease. And here, I lost my driver's license, bro. Like, I don't know what I\ndid with it. I don't know. I don't know what happened.\nI don't, I don't know.\" And they're like, \"It's all\nright. What do you have? Do you have, I need a proof of residency.\" \"Well, I have my lease.\"\n\"Oh, okay. I need a primary.\" \"Okay, here's my birth certificate.\" \"Okay, and I need a secondary.\" \"Here's my Social Security card. But I also registered, you\nknow, I registered to vote. My girlfriend made me vote immediately. And she said I would need\nit,\" \"Oh yeah, that's perfect. You're, you're good. I\ndon't even need that.\" \"Okay, great.\" \"Stand over\nthere. Pay that person.\" They call your number, \"275,\" you know, 45 minutes later you go,\nyou pay your 25 bucks, you stand in front of the\nscreen, they take a picture, you got a driver's license, you walk out, it's still warm, it's beautiful. It smells like pop plastic. It's amazing. And so I'm opening up\ndifferent bank accounts in these guys' names and just about- - [Lex] What do you, yeah, sorry. Well, what are you mostly\ndoing with the identities? You opening up different bank accounts? - Right now?\n- Are you doing a credit starting to establish credit or no? - Some of them, like I\nmight order, I might order secured credit cards,\nso I can't get credit. You know, I'm building their credit. Like it's not helping me in any way. I'm just sending out $500\nto get a Capital One card or a American, I'm sorry, a Bank of America secured\ncredit card, whatever. So I'm building their\ncredits, but not all of them. Only a few because I'm collect, although I'm collecting them,\nI'm also gonna be moving soon. I'm only here to get a few hundred thousand dollars and move. I need some kind of a base. So I don't wanna start\ngetting credit cards and building up a history in\nAtlanta in anybody's name. But I am getting driver's\nlicenses in other states. So I've made a, like North\nCarolina, South Carolina. - What's the primary\nmethod of income here? When you move to a place? South Carolina? How do you make 100,000\nat this at this time? - Oh, well, I'm in, right now, I'm living in this guy's house\nand I satisfied his loans. The house is worth 200,000.\n- Got it. So what happens is, one day we go and we check public records. Remember I told you it takes months for it to show up and it shows up. He's got no mortgages on the house. So now I'm, I turn around and I make a fake ID in\nthe name Michael Shanahan, and I'm living in his\nhouse, but I have no credit. Right, there's no credit. So I've got a, the ID, I've\ngot a Social Security number and I order some secure\ncredit cards in his name. So if you pull that\ncredit profile, it does, it shows up saying he's\ngot some credit cards, but it's, they've only, they're\nonly a month or two old. So I can't go to like Bank of America. I mean, I could, but I needed to get the money as quick as possible. Like I wanna get out of Atlanta. So, and at this point, by the way, there's multiple articles\nshowing up in Tampa. So the \"St. Petersburg Times\" is writing multiple articles about me. - With your face.\n- With my picture. Yeah, but it's, honestly, it's pre, I mean not pre-internet,\nbut, it's post-internet, but it's in its infancy. Like no, nobody's, it's not huge. And honestly, it's a local newspaper in Tampa. It's not that big of a deal. Like I'm not concerned about\nthat so much at this point. What I'm concerned about\nis getting a chunk of money and just moving on and kind\nof re-establishing ourselves in a better way where we're\nnot living in a building that we're going to be committing\nfraud in with our house. So, but I'm living in this place. I make a fake ID in the\nname Michael Shanahan. And I call up three secured, or sorry, three hard money lenders. A hard money lender is a\nguy that lends his own money or other investors' money on\nproperty, kinda like a bank. But he's lending his own\nmoney so he doesn't have to really meet the banking requirements and he can charge a much\nhigher interest rate. These guys are charging 12,\n13% interest, simple interest. And they're only lending\nyou a much lower percentage of the value of your home. So they're not lending\nyou 90% of the value, they're lending you 65%, 60%. So I call three of these guys. They all come out to the\nhouse at different times. And each one of them says,\n\"I'll lend you 100,000. Or it's like 150,000, 150. Like they all lend roughly 150,000. So we schedule three separate closings. None of them know about the other person. So what I do is I close one loan on, let's say Monday and then one on Tuesday, and then went on whatever\nWednesday or Thursday, or that may have all been the same day, to be honest, but I don't remember. The point is, I go to three\nseparate title companies or real estate attorneys, and we close and I get checks for, you know,\nafter cost and everything. The total ends up being roughly 400,000. So I've got 400,000, Becky\nand I run another scam in Tallahassee, Florida. And we get like 50 grand. And plus we, the 80s dwindled\ndown to close to nothing 'cause we, we had gone\non several vacations. We went to like Bermuda and\nI think we went to Jamaica. We actually stayed at the Ritz in Jamaica. So it was very nice.\n- You and Becky. So Becky turned out to be pretty good in terms of scams on the road. - No, she was useless. She was horrible. And she just spent money all the time. And by the, what I realized too, very quickly is she's bipolar. So she's bipolar and she's absolutely, you know, insane. She smokes pot all the time. - Did that matter for you personally or did it actually affect\nthe, how good you were able to do these particular scams? - It was that she was the type of person that would start an argument\nat one o'clock in the morning. And scream at the top of her\nlungs and get the cops called. - Okay.\n- So I can't have the police called, I can't get taken downtown\nand fingerprinted. I can't have the police showing up. I don't know who's really, who's looking. We haven't had plastic\nsurgery at this point. We're still pulling money together, so- - [Lex] Oh, Becky. - Yeah, Becky's a problem. And at some point I\nactually, we send her to a, like a psychiatrist and they give her, they put her on Zoloft and\nshe takes it for like a month or two and then she stops taking it. She thought she was all better. Like, you're not all better. - So, can you gimme a timeline here? How long are you able to be\non the road here successfully? - Three years.\n- Three years? - This is me. This is the first few months.\n- Three years. - Well, so, yeah.\n- Three years. - What happens is we get\nthat little chunk of money, we put it deposited\ninto these bank accounts and we start pulling out cash and, which works out fine\n'cause we've got a bunch of accounts and we're pulling\nout little amounts, 7,000, 5,000, 8,000. And, you know, I would cash\nchecks against her accounts and they would call her to verify, \"Oh, is there's someone here trying\nto cash a check for $9,000?\" You know, \"Can you verify the payee?\" And they'd go, \"Oh yeah,\nthat's Scott Cugno.\" \"Oh, okay, thank you.\"\nAnd they'd cash the check. You know, these are new\naccounts, so it looks odd. But, you know, we are\nalways, I open the account. So what ends up happening is, we're cashing them and I remember getting really frustrated 'cause\nit was just taking forever. And I had gone into a bank one time, and you know, they have\nbanks where that they cash, they actually cash, like large checks. Like if you go into Bank\nof America and you try and cash a check for $15,000 or 25,000, they probably won't do it. They'll tell you, \"We don't\nhave that much cash on hand. We don't this, we don't that.\" They have certain banks that do that. So they told me where one\nof those was, I went there, I had a check for like 29,000 that had been cut on a\nclosing for Michael Shanahan. Remember I refinanced Michael Shanahan's. And then I've got a check\nfor 29,000 that was issued to Scott Cugno. So I'm sitting in the bank, I go in there and I say,\nI need to cash this. And she says, \"You're gonna\nhave talk to the manager.\" I go, \"Okay.\" She says,\n\"Go sit down over there.\" I go sit down in the little glass cubicle. He comes over and he says, \"I see you're trying to cash this check.\" And I was like, \"Right,\" he goes, \"Why don't you just\ndeposit in your own bank?\" And I went, \"My bank account,\nmy bank is a credit union or something, and it's in like Florida. Like, they'll hold this\nthing for like two weeks. Like, I need the money now I\nhave people I need to pay.\" He is like, \"Well, I'm not sure.\" And I was like, \"Well, it's fine. It's a cashier's check. Like it's good.\" \"And he goes, \"No, it's good. It's good.\" I said, \"You have the money.\" And he is like, \"Yeah, we have the money.\" He said, \"It's just odd. Hold on.\" He goes back in the back and he comes back and he says, \"Where'd you get the check?\" Cashier's check. I said,\n\"It was a cashier's check. It was drawn off of a closing\nfor somebody's property that I, we're doing\nthe company I work for, we are putting on an addition on,.\" \"Okay, that makes sense.\" Comes back, goes, \"Well,\nwhy do you need cash?\" And I was like, \"I'm cashing guys' checks that work for the company. Like there's a lot of these\nguys that are like Mexican guys. They give them a check, they\ngo to a check cashing company or they get charged five, 10%. So I cashed him, I'm like,\nI don't under like, what, the check's good, right?\" Like my, and he's like, \"Yeah, we're just trying to verify some stuff.\" And he went, \"Yeah, hold\non.\" And he leaves again. And I remember my cell phone rang and I pick up the phone, it's Becky, said, \"What are you doing?\nWhat's taking so long?\" I go, \"Ah, the guy's being a jerk. He doesn't wanna gimme the money.\" Oh, she's like, \"Oh my\nGod, get outta the bank. Get outta the bank.\" And I went, \"I can't get outta the bank. The guy's got my ID, he's\ngot my credit card, my ID and the check for 29,000. Like, he's gonna call the police\nif I just jump up and run.\" And I go, \"Don't call me again. I'll let you know. It'll be fine.\" Hang out the phone. She calls back, same conversation. \"I'm bouncing off the walls. I'm like, I'm going crazy.\"\n(Matt imitates yelling) Like, \"It'll be fine.\" Hang up the phone. He comes back out and he\ngoes, he said, I said, \"Hey,\" I said, \"What's taking so long?\" And he goes, \"We're trying to get in touch with Michael Shanahan\nto verify the check.\" That was not good for me. Like I'm thinking,\nright, right, okay, okay. And he walks away, the\nphone rings, it's Becky, \"What's going on?\" I go, \"They're trying to get\nahold of Michael Shanahan.\" She goes, \"Oh my God! Oh my God!\" And I'm like, \"Oh my God. And I would remember thinking, I shouldn't have left her the keys. There's a good chance I run\noutta this place and she does, she's not there.\n- But by the way, when you're sitting there, you're who? Scott? You're Scott.\n- I'm Scott Cugno. - And then he's calling Michael Shanahan. - Right, they're saying\nthey're trying to get in touch with Michael Shanahan. So then the phone rings,\nmy cell rings again, and I look, and it's not Becky's. - Yeah.\n- Not Becky. So I pick up the phone, I go, \"Hello?\" And she says, \"Hi, this\nis Kim from SunTrust Bank, is this Michael Shanahan?\" So I'm like, \"Yes, it\nis Michael Shanahan.\" And she says, \"There's a guy here, he's trying to cash a check. It's very large. Could\nyou verify the payee?\" And I go, \"Sure, it's Scott Cugno. He's trying,\" I said, \"I\nbelieve the amount's $29,000.\" And she goes, \"That's\nright. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\" I said, \"Okay,\" I said, \"Hey, by the way, how'd you get my number?\nThis is my cell number.\" And she's like, \"Oh, I'm sorry. We called the title company and the title company gave\nus your phone number.\" Well, I closed those\nloans. That's my cell. That's why if they looked in\nany other way, I would've, they could've gotten in touch\nwith a real Michael Shanahan. So I was like, \"Oh,\nokay.\" Hang up the phone. - You're sitting, you answered\nthe phone from the bank while sitting in the bank. - As Scott.\n- As Michael Shan- - As Scott Cugno.\n- As Scott pretending to be Michael-\n- So I just, right. So I just verified the check myself. - As Matthew pretending to be Scott that's pretending to be Michael. - Right.\n- Yeah. - So I wait there, terrified still. They come out about two minutes later, the manager comes out, plus a woman, I'm assuming maybe that was Kim. She never said anything. And she walks out and she says, and he counts out the money twice. 29,000. 29,000. And I stand up and I mean just like, I'm remember like shoving\nthe money in my pockets. Like I'm trying to get outta\nthere so quick, I'm like, \"Hey,\" I'm like, \"Okay, cool.\" Like, I'm thinking this\nwhole thing's is, you know, feels bad and I'm getting\nup and I'm, so, I'm starting to walk outta the bank. And he goes, he said,\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Cugno?\" And I said, \"Yes, sir.\" I turned around and he goes, \"I'd like you to know,\nI'd like you to know that I feel very apprehensive\nabout this transaction.\" And I go, \"Really? What is it exactly?\" And he goes, \"I can't\nput my finger on it.\" And I go, \"It'll come to you.\" And I turn around and I just\nbolt right out of there. And so keep in mind, a week or so later, the Secret Service shows up. \"Did you cash a check for $29,000?\" So what's so funny is like, that was one of the last checks we cashed. So we ended up with like 400,000. - Was there a connection between the Secret Service and this guy? - No, the-\n- The apprehension? - So the FBI's looking for\nme kind of in, in Tampa. And they've put out a\nfugitive warrant for me, which is how the US Marshals got involved. - So this US Marshals\ntrack down fugitives. - Yes. Federal fugitives, they track down. - But everybody's after\nyou, you're on every list. - Right, I'm on the FBI's Most Wanted list.\n- Most wanted. - At that point the Secret\nService got involved once I leave Atlanta. So when Becky and I pack up our bags and we leave Atlanta, the\nSecret Service got involved because of identity theft, you know, banking, identity theft. The Secret Service doesn't\njust do counterfeiting and protect the president. They also protect the\nfinancial infrastructure of the United States. And they especially have jurisdiction when identity theft is involved. - So I identity theft\nplus bank fraud there. That's when they arrest.\n- They move, yeah. That's it. That's their territory. So they don't.\n- And the US Marshals are just fugitives.\n- US Marshals, just fugitives. They don't do any investigation. - They're all kind of work. Okay. But they're all kind of working together. - Yeah, they, yeah. The, you know, like the\nUS Marshals are like, let's say an arm of all of the various law enforcement agencies, federal agencies, not the states. The states have their own\nfugitive task forces or fugitive. - So when you leave Atlanta, basically everybody's after you. - Everybody's after me. - Did you know this at that\ntime or did you sense it or? - No, I mean, now, you know, every day you're looking up, you're just looking\nyour name up every day. Like, I'm not, because I'm\njust trying to get a bunch of money and just blend in, right? Things were not as interconnected at that time as they are now. But they're starting\nto get interconnected. But of course, I have no idea how much. I barely go on the internet\nfor anything, you know, dating, that's the only thing that\nthe internet, you know, I'd never been on Facebook. At this point Facebook isn't\neven up, isn't even out yet. This is 2006. - Still, were you trying to stay low? - Yeah, I am because\nI'm not a flashy person. Like I'm not driving, you\nknow, like I didn't go out and buy a red Lamborghini,\nyou know, I'm driving, I'm driving 40, $50,000 cars. You know, I've had some\nsports cars, 70, 80, you know, maybe that's 150,000 sports car now. But it's still not flashy. It's not like it's bright red or yellow. I mean, these are, it's always something, you know, nondescript. And I'm living in areas that\nthese cars are everywhere, you know, I go to, so I end up going to\nCharlotte, North Carolina. We rent an apartment,\nwe decide to run a scam in South Carolina. So I go to Columbia, South Carolina. And in between this period\nof time we go to Las Vegas and I, when we go to\nLas, we go to Las Vegas to drop off a bunch of money\nto Becky's son's father who's taking care of her son. We drop off some money there. We go and we start and while we're there, it's like, hey, there's homeless people here. So we-\n(Matt laughs) - So you're always, you.\n- Usually I don't feel bad telling these stories. You make me feel bad.\n- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My judgment is showing. No, but you have to be\ncollecting identities, I guess, to be constantly creating new identities. - So I got my survey forms. So I go and I, you know, we go out and we're taking, I'm taking surveys and I end up going up to\nthis guy who's like two or three guys that are\nstanding on like a bench or sitting on next to\na bench or something. And I see him and I walk up\nand the guy, one guy gets up and he comes over and he is like, \"Hey, what do you need?\" And I went, \"I'm taking\nsurveys for the Salvation Army to determine where we place\nour next homeless facility.\" And the guy goes, \"Oh,\nI'm not interested.\" And they always said that. And I said, \"It pays 20\nbucks cash right now. It'll take you five minutes.\" And they're like, \"What?\nYou $20 cash right now? I was like, \"Yeah,\" I show them the cash. And they go, \"Okay, yeah,\nyeah. What do you need?\" Name, date of birth,\nSocial Security number. So when I get to criminal record, the guy, he says, \"Criminal record?\" He's like, \"Yeah, I've been arrested.\" He goes, \"I've been arrested like three, four times for,\" he\nsaid, \"For prostitution.\" He said, \"But they're like misdemeanors.\" And I went, \"Okay.\" And it was like, okay, prostitution, to me, women get charged\nwith prostitution, you know? Men get charged with solicitation. I went, \"Prostitution?\" And he goes and he went,\nhe said, \"Yeah, yeah.\" He said, \"I offered to blow an\nundercover cop for 20 bucks.\" He said, \"That's what I\nthought you were coming out here for.\" And I was like, and I\nwas like, \"No, no, bro.\" I said, \"Okay.\" And he's like, \"Yeah.\" He said, you know, he goes, I mean, he said, \"I\nmean, a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do, you know?\" And he made some comment or something. I was like, \"Okay.\"\n- Yeah. - So I jot down the\nrest of it, we're good. I give him 20 bucks, I\nget in my car, I leave. We get back to North Carolina. I order all of his documents.\nHis name was Gary Sullivan. I then go to South Carolina. When I go to South Carolina, I get a real estate agent. We drive around for a day. We look at like five or six houses. I put five owner financing contracts\non five different houses. So I get him, he writes up\nfive contracts, all of them. I'm asking for owner\nfinancing, I'll put down 10%. I want owner financing. Two of them end up coming back and saying, \"Yes, we'll do it.\" I have two closings. One of them is a house\nthat's worth like 225,000. I put down 25 grand.\nAnother one's 110,000. I put down 11,000. So\nI buy these two houses. I then satisfy the loans\non both the houses. Everything seems like it's going okay. Although Becky's a lunatic at this point. She's had so many, she\nwon't take her medication. She's had so many outbursts that, and we've had, by this time\nwe've had plastic surgery. Like she's gotten plastic\nsurgery, she's gotten a boob job, she's gotten liposuction,\nI mean, all kinds of stuff. So-\n- Look way different? Like appearance changes or? - Thinner, better looking, you know, just tightened everything up, I guess. You know, she was in her, she'd had a kid, and she was 30, 33, 34. I don't know how old she was. 20, 32, 33. I don't know, roughly my age. So yeah, I thought she looked, you know, she lost like 15 pounds. Like she was not 'cause of the surgery, but just in general, we're\nnot, we're just working out. We're going mountain climbing. We're, you know, riding\nbikes, we're doing, you know, there's fraud's not a full-time job. So, you know, we have plenty of time. So we're goofing off. And, but she's also a lunatic. You know, she's getting the cops called, she's able to go out and\nshe's able to stay stoned 24 hours a day. She's going out with friends, drinking. I never leave the house. You know, even to this day, I really barely ever leave the house. I'm very much a homebody kind of person. So like the idea that I'm able to make my living doing YouTube and I'd never have to leave my house. I love that. I don't ever go anywhere except\nfor the gym and back home. That's it. So what happens is, I've actually moved her\nout of my apartment. Like I had an apartment\ndowntown, 30 story building. I actually moved her\ninto another apartment. She's that much of a lunatic. We can't even be in the same place. Multiple times I've tried to leave her, she's called me up and\nbegged me to come back. It's horrible. So I end\nup buying a couple houses in Columbia, South Carolina. I satisfy the loans on the houses. I've got an ID, not a driver's license, but an ID in the name\nof Gary Lee Sullivan. And I refinanced, or I\nrefinanced those houses. 'cause keep in mind there\nwas owner financing, but they also had mortgages. So there's something called\na wraparound mortgage. So these guys did wraparound mortgages. So let's say you buy a\nhouse for 200, $250,000 and the bank lends you 200,000. And then you own or\nfinance the house to me. So we do a, I give you 50 grand down, but I'm not able to get\na loan from the bank to pay off your mortgage. So what we do is you do\na wraparound mortgage. So I'll pay you your mortgage\nand you pay the bank. So there is a second\nmortgage on the property, but it's called a wrap, it's wrapped around your first. - That's legal? - Yeah. So I wouldn't lie to you. So it's, so there's, these\nhave wraparound mortgages. So-\n- You're always selling and you're good at it. - So I go, I satisfy the\nloans, the owner finance loans, the wraparound mortgages, and I satisfy the loans\ntheir, the original loans that these people took out\non their own mortgages. One of them, by the way, I\nsat, you know, you have to sign as the president of the bank, right? - Yeah.\n- So I sign it as C. Montgomery Burns, which is the aging tycoon, the\nguy that owns a power plant in \"The Simpsons,\" TV show. - Yeah.\n- So I sign that and I notarize it, which\nI thought was cute. I actually wanted to sign all\nof them cartoon characters. And Becky was screaming her head off and wouldn't let me do it, right? Like I wanted to do all\n\"The Simpsons,\" right? But she wouldn't let me do it. She's screaming and hollering. So I ended up, you know,\nseeing, nobody knows who C. Montgomery Burns is. So I sign it, notarize it,\nall of those are satisfied. I then go to the multiple banks and I refinance, start refinancing all these properties multiple times. So I'm applying for these loans and I'm getting the loans and I'm closing. So I've got like five or\nsix loans on this one house. So house is like 225,000, I think it was like 230, whatever. I borrow like four or\nfive loans on that house. So I borrow like\n$190,000, like five times. So I've got like $800,000. And then I borrow another three or 400,000 on the other house. The one, the smaller one, right? So it ends up being like $1.3 million. It's actually like 1.5 million. It was more, but what\nhappened with that was, so keep in mind, you can only open up so many bank accounts in your name. You can go to Bank of\nAmerica, they'll open one. Then you go to SunTrust, they'll open one. They're gonna ask, they\nmight even ask you, \"Did you open another bank account today?\" 'Cause every time you do\nit, there's an inquiry into something called\nCheck Systems or AccuCheck. And so then they go, so\nthen by the time you go to the third bank, they'll say, \"Listen, something's not right. You've got multiple inquiries.\" You know, if you go to\nwhatever Mercantile Bank, there might be, they might go,\n\"Okay, we're gonna open one,\" they're gonna need an explanation. But you're not, you're not\nopening more than three. By the third one, they're gonna be like, \"Absolutely not, something's wrong.\" So, you know, I've got\nmultiple identities, but I can only open up so many banks. The other problem is that these checks, they'll only give you\nso much money on a refi. Usually after 100,000, they\nonly wanna let you walk away with let's say $100,000. So one of the things I did\nwas I would typically record another mortgage and have\nthem pay that mortgage off. So I had to open, I opened\na corporation to do that so I could then turn around and go open corporate bank accounts, 'cause now it's not\ngoing off my information, it's going off the corporation so I can open up multiple\ncorporate bank accounts. - [Lex] Well, these\ncorporations are fake or real? - No, no, I went to a real\ncorporate bank attorney to corporate attorney\nand had him open them. I gave him whatever. I gave\nhim like $1,500, $2,000. And he opened up a corporation\nfor me, Gary Sullivan. And I then turned around and I went and opened up multiple bank accounts in that corporation's name. - How are you keeping track of all this? 'Cause it.\n- This is, I don't need this. - So I-\n- It's in your head or do you have good organization? - No, no, oh no, no, I have, every single identity has its own file with, you know, plastic inlays,\nsleeves for their passports. - [Lex] Oh, it's nice in order. - Yeah, it's super organized.\n- You open this. I'm Gary now.\n- Right. That's exactly what it is. Like, you kind of go over,\nboom, boom, boom, boom. You sit in your car for a minute, you put it down, you walk in. Well, what happens is it\nwent up to like 1.5 million and I'm pulling money outta the bank. And then one day I got a phone call on Gary Sullivan's cell phone. The guy, it's a lawyer. They call up, he says, \"Hey, I'm lawyer with Washington Mutual. We have an issue.\" I said, \"What's that?\" He says, \"We got a phone\ncall from the title company,\" one of the title companies that I was attempting to refinance one of the pieces of\nproperty with noticed that I, they had been sent, they'd been\nsent a document that showed that I had purchased the property. And I said, I purchased it cash and the documents that\nI purchased it cash. And they got that and there was actually a\nmortgage on the property. And so somehow or\nanother, they connected it and they called Washington Mutual and they said, \"Look, there's\nan issue, there's a fraud. We have a fraudulent document here.\" And he was like, he said,\n\"So we went and we looked and it turns out that\nwe pulled public records and that there is a\nmortgage in front of us, several mortgages in front of us. So there's like three or four\nmortgages in front of me, Washington Mutual, you owe us.\" And it wasn't that much,\nit was like a hundred, it was like a hundred grand, right? Like 95 or a hundred. And I said, \"Okay.\" And he said, \"So there's an issue here. You've got a few mortgages in front of us and we're supposed to be a first mortgage and we're not supposed to be\ntwo mortgages behind or three.\" And I was like, \"Okay, sounds\nlike a, sounds like an error. Not a big deal. Have you\ncontacted law enforcement?\" He said, \"No, I haven't. I was hoping we could\nrectify this some other way.\" I said, \"You know what? I think we can. I'm gonna have my lawyer call you back. I'm gonna go to his place right now. Give me about two hours.\" No problem, I immediately\nrun, jump in my car, head towards South Carolina,\ncall my corporate lawyer, tell him, \"Look, I need to talk to you. Here's what's going on.\" I explain it to him. He doesn't really understand. He says, \"This sounds pretty complicated. I have a, my law partner is\na criminal defense attorney. I'm gonna have, I'm gonna set up a meeting right now with all of us.\" Okay, I get there 45 minutes\nlater, I walk in the door, I sit down, he says, \"What happened?\" I said, \"Oh,\" they said, you know, \"Gary, this doesn't sound right. What's, what do you, what happened?\" I said, \"Okay, so listen,\nbought this house. I bought it cash. I then refinanced it.\" I didn't buy it cash, but I\ntold them, \"I bought it cash. I refinanced it like four or five times within a day or two of each other.\" And they were like, \"How\nis that even possible?\" I was like, \"Well, I went to\ndifferent title companies\" and I explained how I do it. I said, \"Washington Mutual just found out that they're in like second\nposition or third position,\" or I said, \"But they're probably, they may be in fourth position. You know, they mail these\nthings in so you never know.\" And he was like, \"Oh my God. He's like, that's what do you want to do?\" I said, \"I want you to contact them and agree for them to not\ncontact the authorities provided I pay them off.\" He goes, \"Do you have the money?\" I said, \"I do have the money. I can go get the money right now.\" He calls the lawyer, this\nis back when faxes, right? So they fax some documents back and forth. They make, they do a couple\nemails back and forth and they have a conversation. I remember the lawyer started arguing 'cause he wanted to charge\nme like yield spread and fees and stuff. And I was like, \"What\nare you talking about? Like, I'll pay it.\" Like, so it ends up being\na little over 100,000. And I'm like, \"That's it.\"\nSo he is like, \"Okay.\" And so he says, \"Okay, that sounds good.\" And so he said, \"Okay, all you have to\ndo is go get the check.\" And he said, \"Bring it to\na Washington Mutual branch. Tell them to call,\" I said, \"I'm not going in a\nWashington Mutual branch, bro. I'll bring you the check.\" So he calls him back, \"He's not\ndoing that, man, he's done.\" \"Okay, I'm not, I'll bring it here. You guys take care, \"he said, no problem.\" Okay, hang up the phone. And he turns to me and he says, \"Okay, well we have a problem.\" He said, \"We still have the problem of these other mortgages.\" And I went, \"Right.\" And he goes, \"Okay, well.\" I said, \"They don't know anything.\" He said, \"I know, but Gary.\" He said, \"What if they find out?\" I said, 'They find out that they're like in second and third and fourth by place?' He's like, \"Right.\" I\nsaid, \"I leave town.\" And he went, so they both laugh. They go, \"Gary, you can't just leave town. They have a copy of your driver's license. They have your Social Security number, they have your birth certificate.\" He said, he goes, \"They'll\nfind you. It's the FBI.\" And I go, \"You're assuming\nI'm Gary Sullivan.\" - Wow. You tell them.\n- And he, they, listen, they looked at me and they went, and I remember he said, he goes, \"We'll cross that bridge\nwhen we get to it.\" And I said, \"Right, my\nimmediate problem is getting rid of these people.\" And he goes, \"Right, right.\" So I go get the check, bring\nit back, give it to them. Never called the FBI. - I can't believe you got away\nwith the Washington Mutual. - Oh no, this is-\n- I mean, these are all really close calls it seems like. - You No, this is the close call. I have two more close calls that my hands sweat thinking about it. I walk in, I walk into Wachovia. I just opened this account two months ago, so it's a new account. So whenever I would go\nin there and I'd say, \"Hey, I need a $7,000,\n$6,000,\" anything over $3,000, they had to call to get permission, right? Like authorization. So she's like, \"Okay, I gotta go call.\" I said, \"No problem.\" So the girl walks in the back,\nI'm sitting there waiting. All of a sudden a massive person reaches over my hand and grabs my wrist and somebody grabs it from the other one and they pull my hands behind my back. These are two of possibly the largest law enforcement officers I've\never seen in my entire life. I mean, they're massive. And they handcuff me and they say, \"You are Mr. Sullivan, you're being detained. We're taking you into custody and, you know, putting, you, we're holding you until\na detective gets here.\" - Who are these guys? Is this US Marshalls or\nis this cops or what? - [Matt] These are sheriff's deputies. - Sheriff's deputies. - And as they walk me in-\n- Sullivan, Gary Sullivan. - Right, as they walk me in the back, they're calling me Mr. Sullivan. - Right.\n- They sit me down and by now I am, you know, the Secret service are looking for me. They're calling me. Well, they were calling\nus John and Jane Doe. But now they figured out who we were. And so now I'm on the secret\nservice's Most Wanted list. I'm not like number one at that, right? Like I probably was, but\nwe just found out I was on, like, on that list. So it's getting bad. So they sent me down and I'm waiting and I remember thinking that\nthe FBI was coming, you know, I don't really know at that point, I couldn't tell you the\ndifference between everybody. And then five minutes go by and, you know, I'm sitting\nthere going, \"What is going on? Do you guys have any idea what's going?\" \"They're like, we don't\nknow. We're just grunts. We just do what we're told.\" So suddenly this guy walks in, he's probably in his early 30s maybe, he walks in, gray suit. I think he looks like he's FBI. He says, \"Hey, I'm a detective with the,\" I wanna say Richland\nCounty, you know, whatever, sheriff's department or\npolice department, whatever. And I was like, \"Oh, okay.\" And he says, \"Yeah, listen,\nwe've got an issue.\" Wachovia wants this. They\nwant us to arrest you.\" He said that, \"They're saying that you've got three\nmortgages on your house.\" And I go, \"Is that illegal?\" And he looked at me and he went, \"You know, to be honest, I don't know.\" And I distinctly remember\nthinking, I'm walking outta here. All I have to do is convince this guy, I haven't done anything wrong. He's already said he doesn't know. So he gets on the phone with the head of Wachovia's\nfraud department, and he's telling, saying, \"This guy is running what's\ncalled a shotgunning scam,\" which is absolutely right. And so-\n- What is a shotgun? - It's where you're you\nclose on so many loans simultaneously, they can't catch it. Anyway, they start going back and forth and he's on the phone and he's like, \"Why did you close three loans?\" And I said, \"I,\" you know, \"Why are you pulling,\" I\nsaid, \"It's not illegal. I have a first mortgage,\na second mortgage, and a home equity line of\ncredit, that's perfectly legal.\" And he goes, and you can hear the guy. \"Yeah, it's not, they're\nall first mortgages.\" And I said, \"I read every\none of those documents. Not one of them said they\nwere first mortgages.\" And they don't, first mortgages don't say\nthey're first mortgages. It's the placement of the mortgage, placement of the lien that\ndetermines is their first, second or third. So it's possible that I wouldn't\nhave known it certainly, that I could have read those\ndocuments and not known. And he's like, \"That's not true.\" And he's screaming. And so I go, \"Yeah, listen,\" and he said, \"Well, you're taking out all cash. Why are you taking all cash?\" I said, \"Well, I mean, I don't know if this, this sounds,\" I said, \"I don't know if\nthis might be illegal. I said, I don't know.\" I said, \"I mean, I work\nfor a labor company, Labor on Demand.\" I pull out my business\ncard, \"You can call.\" So I'm like, \"I work for Labor on Demand. And I said, \"We hire a lot of guys that, like, they don't have bank accounts. So the company pays them. And then I'll usually, I'll pull out money and I'll cash their checks because they get charged like 10% of these check cashing companies. And I feel bad. I know\nthe checks are good. So I just deposit them. I mean, I don't think that, but I don't know if that's illegal. I don't think that's illegal. Like if,\" and he is like,\n\"No, no, that's fine. That's a decent thing to\ndo, it's not, that's fine.\" I'm like, \"Oh, okay.\" So he's talking to the guy and you know, Wachovia is screaming out, hollering, he says, \"He's doing that,\" you know, he's going back\nand forth, back and forth. So we're going back and forth, back, and I'm just derailing\neverything this guy says. And at one point he says, he's screaming, \"He's committing fraud, we want him arrested.\" And he's like, \"I don't know\nwhat to charge him with.\" And he's like, you know, he's saying, these aren't, you know,\n\"How did you, you know, how did you?\" He's like, \"Hey, look, how\ndid you even do this? What?\" I go, \"Look, I didn't do this.\" I said, \"I came to Wachovia,\nI met with a loan officer. I said, 'I need a first mortgage, I need to pull out like $100,000. I wanna start buying houses.'\" He goes, \"That's right, you own another house\nhere too, don't you?\" I said, \"I do.\" I said, \"We're putting a new roof on it. We're gonna build an addition.\nWe're putting in a pool. I'm buying one right down\nthe street from that one.\" I said, \"So I'm obviously,\nI'm pulling out money.\" I said, \"So I told them I need $100,000.\" They said, \"That's fine, we can,\" they said they could\nonly get me $100,000 out for something about Fannie\nMae guidelines, which is true. And I said, so then she\nsaid, \"I had, I can get you, I can send you to a friend\nof mine who's a loan officer. She can get you a second\nmortgage,\" which she did. I said, then I told her she\ncould only get me 100,000 or so, 190,000 and the other. And she said, \"You\nshould get an equity line of credit if you're gonna\nbe doing like, you know, renovating properties.\" So she sent me to somebody and they got me an equity line of credit. I said, \"You know, I\nhaven't committed fraud.\" I said, \"I wouldn't\nknow how to commit fraud if you told me.\" I said, \"What sounds more reasonable? A guy that works for a labor company ripped off a bunch of banks for over half a million dollars,\" I said, \"Or some loan\nofficers got together and did something illegal?\" I said, \"There's a problem at the bank.\" And he says, \"I think you've\ngot a problem at the bank.\" And this guy goes nuts. And while he's screaming, \"He needs to be arrested, this is fraud. My loan officers have not\ndone anything illegal. They wouldn't do that.\" He says, \"Look at his ID, his ID is fake. His ID starts with 000.\" South Carolina IDs start with 000. This guy's in California. He has no idea. So when he says that, the detective looks at my ID and he goes, \"Listen,\" he said, \"This is a real ID. I ran this guy through NCIC.\" He said, \"This is Gary Sullivan.\" And I looked at him, I go,\n\"Now I'm not Gary Sullivan? I go, \"Come on bro.\nWhat are we doing here?\" And he goes, \"I know Gary, I know.\" And he says, \"I'm gonna take him downtown. I'm going to talk to\nmy whatever lieutenant, whoever captain, and I'm\ngonna fill out a police report and I'll let you know.\" And he hangs up. - Yeah.\n- I get up, they've taken the\nhandcuffs off, I stand up. As we're walking out with the detectives, as we're all kind of walking out, he goes, \"Hey, you have an ID, do you\nhave a driver's license?\" And I went, \"I do, but\nit's in like Nevada.\" And he goes, \"Oh, that's right.\" He goes, \"You're from Vegas.\" And he looks at the two deputies\nand they all kind of grin. And I think he ran me through NCIC, which means he ran a\nstatewide criminal database, which means he thinks I've\nbeen arrested three times for prostitution in Vegas. \"Ah, right.\" Listen, I'm humiliated. I was just like, and the grin told me, and I was just like, oh man. And so one of the cops goes, \"Here, gimme the ID,\"\ntakes the ID, he goes, \"I'll check and see,\" 'cause I have to follow\nhim back in my car. So he goes, and by the way, my car is in the name Michael Eckert. So Michael Eckert, he\ndoesn't have a photograph of Michael Eckert.\n- Right. - Because you can't pull up\nphotographs from other states. So he doesn't have a photograph, but he knows that's not my car. And he asked me, whose\ncar are you driving? I said, oh, \"That's my\nboss, Michael Eckert.\" And I said that, \"That's my boss.\" And he goes, \"Oh, Michael Eckert?\" I said, \"Yeah, exactly.\" And he's like, and I'm like, oh my God. So I'm thinking he knows Michael Eckert, knows it's registered in North\nCarolina, knows the address, which is where I was currently living. That's a problem. So the police officer, or the, sorry, deputy grabs\nthe ID, walks outside, comes back, I have no idea if this homeless guy has a\ndriver's license in Nevada. I don't know. He had nothing on him. He comes back and he goes,\n\"Does he have a valid license?\" He goes, \"Yeah, it's valid.\" And he hands it to him,\nor he hands me the ID. And he says, he said,\nhe goes, \"It's valid.\" And he looked at me, he\ngoes, \"Yeah, well,\" he said,, \"It says he's like, he\nsays he's five foot 11.\" Like it was like 510, 511. And I'm clearly not 510 or 511. And they all look at me and I go, \"Fellas, with a good pair\nof shoes,\" like that. And they all go,\n(Matt imitates laughing) \"Follow us, Gary.\"\n- Yeah. - I follow them back\nto the police station. Becky is calling me on the\nphone, screaming her head off. Now, I'd always told Becky,\nif I ever get arrested, immediately go get me a lawyer. The lawyer will be able\nto get me out on bond, 'cause I'll be arrested\nfor something stupid. I said, \"It'll be something\nlike trying to cash a check,\" you know, a fake check or a, you know, use of somebody,\nsaid, \"It won't be the, all my IDs are real, so\nit won't be for a fake ID. So my ID won't be in question.\" And most, most police departments and sheriffs at that time did not run your\nfingerprints through AFIS. So they didn't, 'cause\nthey charged them for that. So they don't, they don't typically do it unless your identity is in question. Mine wouldn't be, I have\na valid driver's license or a valid ID in that state. So I go back, she's screaming, she's like, \"Oh my God, you don't understand. I just checked the internet, the website. You are number one on the Secret Services Most Wanted list.\" And I was like, \"I got\nbigger problems right now. They just held me in the bank. I'm following them right now.\"\n- Like right now. - And she was like, \"Get on the interstate. Go, go.\" \"I cannot go, the\ndetective's in front of me. The cops are behind me. They're escorting me\nto the police, listen.\" She's like, Oh my God. Run, run.\" I go, \"Look, I'm not a NASCAR\ndriver, like I'm driving. It's a sports car, but it's\nnot gonna outrun a radio or a helicopter.\" Like, I'm not, that's not gonna happen. I know it looks, it seems nice. I'm not that guy.\" So I was like, I can't, I said,\n\"Look, you don't understand. I was in handcuffs 30 minutes ago. I just talked my way out of\nthem. I'm gonna get outta this.\" And I said, \"The worst that happens is I'll be arrested as Gary Sullivan. You can get me a plea. You\ncan get me an attorney. He can get me out.\" And she goes, \"I'm not\ngetting you an attorney. I'm not getting you out on bond.\" - Oh no, Becky.\n- \"I'm not risking everything I've got for you.\" Because she has all the money. We've got seven, $800,000 at this point. So, oh, and by the way, she's not even in North\nCarolina at this point. She's relocated to Houston, Texas. Because when this scam broke, fell apart, we were gonna move to Texas. So, wait, we were\nalready moving there. So. - But by the way, just a small tangent, where do you store money\nin situations like this that, like, when you talk about 800,000, do you have to keep moving accounts to make sure it's not accessible by FBI?\n- There's about, well, there's about six\nor 700,000 in accounts. But keep in mind, I'm\ngetting that out in cash. Like there's no Bitcoin, there's no, none of that stuff exists. So my, you know, I probably\nshould have bought diamonds or bought gold or bought like,\nI don't know any of that. All I could think of is\ngo in slowly, be patient, don't drain the accounts,\nyou know, fluctuate them. Like I was writing,\ngetting cashier's checks from one account to another. So the balances were doing this, you know, they weren't just going, (Matt imitates deflating) they were doing this, and then one day, boom, they're gone.\n- Okay, got it. - So.\n- Got it. - So we got out, like whatever, we've gotten out like six or 700,000. There's still like six\nor 700,000 in the bank. But I'm not going back. I'm done. I actually, to be honest\nwith you, so well, look, I go in, so I go into the police station and well, first she says, \"If you go in the police\nstation, I'm done. If you get arrested, you're done.\" I said, \"Well, then I\nbetter not get arrested.\" I hang up the phone, the\ncop's standing behind my car. I get out, I go in the\npolice station, I walk in, I fill out the police report. He tells me ,\"I gotta talk\nto my captain real quick. Can you wait?\" He couldn't\nleave me in his cubicle. He goes, \"Can you wait in the hallway? I can't leave you in the cubicle.\" I said, \"No, no problem.\" So I go and I wait in the hallway. In the hallway are a whole wall full of on the corkboard wanted posters. Black and white. Black and white. Like, you know, car thief,\nyou know, rapist, murderer, secret Services most wanted. And I'm on the, on on\nmy faces right there. I'm like, holy Jesus. And you know, everything\nin me told me, \"Run bro. Just fucking haul ass\nright now, right now. Just go, your luck's run out.\" Not that I even thought he\nwas, there were so many, I didn't think he was gonna see it. But it just, everything\nin me just said run. The problem is if you've ever\nbeen a into a police station, you're not getting out of it. Do you understand that?\n- There's a lot of cops around.\n- No, well, not just that, but they buzz you in. - Yeah.\n- You get in the elevator, you have to punch in a code.\n- Right? - You have to punch in a code to get back out of the elevator. You have to punch in a code\nto get into the next door. There's like a, I mean, it's impossible. Like I'm never, I'm not\ngonna get in the elevator. So guy comes back up to the,\ncop comes back up, he said, \"Hey, Gary, appreciate it. No problem. My captain said, we're good. We're gonna wait for a phone\ncall from the,\" no wait. \"The district attorney called already. They're looking into it. I'm\ngonna go ahead and let you go.\" I go downstairs, he\nwalks me out to my car. He said, \"Look, do me a favor.\" He is like, \"We do have\nsome serious questions at this point, like the\ndistrict attorney says, there's some, something's up,\" he said. And I said, \"Not with me.\" And he said, \"Well, just do me a favor.\" He goes, \"Don't leave town.\" I said, \"Bro, I own two houses here. I'm not going anywhere.\" I said, \"I'm telling you right now. I said, \"Wachovia, they fucked up.\" And he is like, \"I believe\nyou. I believe you.\" He said, well, he said, whatever. He is like, \"I hope that you're right. I'm sure you're right.\" Okay, so I get in my car, I leave, I go to two more banks,\npull out more money. But at one point I go into a bank and like two of the\ncashiers practically slam into each other, trying\nto get to the phone. And I could tell something's up. Like, oh, no, no, no, no. Something's up. So I back, I get in my car, back out. One of them even kind of runs out and looks at the tag number, you know. So I drive, I get on the interstate. I go, I, you know, Becky,\nof course, she's, you know. \"I'm sorry, I love you. I would've never done\nthat. I was just scared.\" I understand. I go-\n- Becky sounds like a handful. - Oh my God, bro. So I go all\nthe way back to Charlotte. I pack up my apartment. I drive all the way to Houston with my entire apartment packed\nup, by the way, in a U-Haul. Like the next day, the\nnext morning we pack. She's got people there\npacking it up, movers. We pack it up. I drive the\nU-Haul all the way to Houston. Takes a couple days. I unload it into, we\nhave some guys unload it into a storage unit. 'cause I'm gonna stay with Becky until I find my own apartment. As we're driving around the\nneighborhood, super nice. She's living in like, whatever,\nlike on like that 20th floor or something of some huge\nhigh rise, great apartment. We drive by and I go, \"Oh, stop the car,\" and I go, \"I want to get out.\" It is one of those cone\nthings where there's flyers for the house, for a house. I jump out and I get the flyer, and she's like, \"What are you doing?\" I go, oh, \"I just want, you know, I just look at looking at the flyer and she says, \"I don't\nwanna do a scam here. I wanna live here. This place\nis nice. I love it here.\" And I went, \"Right, I understand.\" I said, \"I'm not gonna,\" I said, \"No, but I have to find an apartment.\" And she goes, \"Oh, you just,\nI'm just so disgusting. You can't stand to spend\neven a couple weeks with me. You just,\" and she goes just ballistic. She's screaming at the top of her lungs. And I know she's gonna get me caught. She's never gonna get me out, right? She's already told me that. So we go back to the\napartment, we go upstairs. I was so scared of this chick, bro. I was so scared, I remember I\nwas going up in the elevator and this girl gets on\nthis clearly a stripper. I mean, drop dead, just but\nwearing stripper clothes. - Yeah.\n- And I'm staring like, and as soon she got on, Becky\ngave me that, with the face. And I'm like, this, I'm\nlike staring in the corner and never look at the girl. And I remember we get off the elevator. (Matt imitates elevator bell dinging) It opens, I bolt off\nit, Becky bolts office, off the elevator. And I remember she squeals. \"I bet you'd just love\nto fuck that tramp.\" And the girl, as the elevator\ndoors are closing, she goes, \"Hey!\"\n(Matt laughs) I thought that was funny. So I go to the apartment. We have a screaming match, kind of, tell her I wanna split up the money. She tells me she's not gonna\ngimme, split the money. - Why?\n- Because she said, \"You can go somewhere\nelse and do this again. You'll have a million\ndollars in six months. You know, I have to live off this money. - [Lex] Did she threaten you? - Oh, she threatened\nthe, it was funny too, 'cause the conversation back and forth, I remember saying, \"No, I want half.\" And she goes, and she said,\n\"I'll give you $10,000.\" I said, \"You're outta your mind.\" I said, \"I'm telling\nright now, you come up with something reasonable,\nI'll take all of it.\" And she said, what did she say? I said, \"I'll take all of it.\" She goes, \"In what? Escape in that U-Haul they're gonna,\" she goes, the cops are\ngonna be looking for in five minutes?\" And I went, and I just\nremember thinking, oh, wow. And keep in mind all of my IDs, everything are in the storage\nunit that she has a key to. Like, I'm not getting those. It's over. - Yeah.\n- I got an ID right now that says, my name is Michael Eckert. - Yeah.\n- I'm driving a, I'm driving a U-Haul van. - Yeah. Sounds like she has a\nlot of negotiation leverage. - Right, so we start\narguing back and forth and she says, \"$100,000.\" - Yeah,\n- \"I'll give you 100,000.\" I said, \"I'll take it.\" She counts it out. She counts out the 100,000. Later, when I recount it,\nit wasn't even a hundred. It was like 98,000.\nThat's fine. It's fine. So, but you know, we've\ngot them all marked, you know, 2000, 5,000, 6,000. She's like, \"2000, 5,000, 12. That's it.\" She ends up stiffing me. That's fine. It's not my money. So I take it, I end up, you\nknow, I take it, I leave. And as I'm leaving, she'd always called me before on the phone and\nbegged and pleaded and cried. \"I messed up. Please\ngimme a chance. I'm sorry. I'll take my medication. I'm sorry. I thought it was better.\nI thought it was okay.\" And I remember walking\nout, I put my cell phone on the counter and just\nwalked out, went downstairs, got in the truck, and drove, and drove. When I got to Louisiana, I stopped at Baton Rouge and got a, I mean, at some point I stopped and I got like, I think I got a room or something at one point. I know I stopped. - [Lex] So you drove\nwithout a plan essentially? - I drove back to Charlotte to get my car. - Got it.\n- So I can't be driving. I can't drive this car.\n- Yeah, right. - So I stopped at Baton Rouge at one point and got a cell phone, you\nknow, like a burner phone, like a Verizon Virgin Mobile or something. One of those little\nphones. So I bought one. I call a few people at home,\nback home, call my mom. She's in tears crying. My dad's\nyelling in the background. I call,\n- What's your mom? Just a small tangent, what\ndid your mom and dad say? You remember, anything\nstand out to you as? - No, my dad, you know, you know. \"Well, I hope you're happy. You know, your mother, every time someone mentions\nyour name, your mother cries.\" Which is funny to me, 'cause like, growing up,\nlike he was never concerned about her crying, you know? So it was like, since when\ndid you care? You know? And I just, so I mean, my dad, like, he's an alcoholic, you know, he's been sober for\ntwo years, a month and a half. Drunk, drunken, binge or\ndrinking, sorry, drinking binge, and then sober for six months and then did it again, then sober. You know, it just went back and forth. And in and out of alcohol,\nyou know, drug programs. But like I said, worked for\nState Farm and State Farm, he was a top selling manager. And so what they would do is, they'd put him into a 30 day program. And I mean like a, like,\nhe has to stay there. And they had, they were\nthe only ones that had that kind of control, 'cause they're like, \"You're gonna do this and you're gonna pass\nit, or we're firing you.\" You know? He made a lot of money and he made a lot of money for State Farm. And he hired and trained a ton of agents, and he had one of the\ntop performing agencies. So he was worth a lot to them. And, but, so I end up, what ends up happening\nis I'm driving through, I get that phone that I\nwas telling you about, and I call, so I call, talk to my mom. She's, you know, she's crying. She's like, \"I love you so much. You know, I just wanna\nmake sure you're safe.\" I end up calling Susan\nBarkowitz which was one of the brokers that\nworked for me at the time. Call her and I say, \"Hey,\nwhat's going on? How's it?\" She's like, \"Oh, Matt, man,\nyou know, what's going on? FBI's everywhere, like they've\nbeen talking everybody.\" They, you know, and this\nhas been, it's like a year and a half at this point. And she's like, \"It's\nnot, you know, they're, they come around every once in a while. Everybody's gone in. Everybody's cooperating,\neverybody's talking, everybody's blaming you,\" including her. And so as we're talking,\nshe said, \"Look, I've, the main FBI agent on the case. She told me if I ever spoke\nwith you to have you call her.\" And I was like, \"Yeah, I'm good.\" So she goes, \"Her name is Candace. And she wants you to call her.\" She goes, \"At least call\nher for God's sakes. Maybe you could just turn yourself in. Maybe you can negotiate\njust like a couple years. Like a 'cause they're, if\nthey're not gonna catch you, then maybe turning yourself in. Maybe it'll help, at least hear her out.\" And I was like, \"Okay,\nall right. You're right.\" Hang up the phone. I call\nCandace, she picks up the phone. I go, \"Hey.\" She goes, \"Who's this?\" And I go, this is \"Matt Cox.\" And she goes, \"Hey, hello\nMr. Cox, how are you?\" And I go, \"I'm doing okay. How's it going? I understand you wanna talk to me.\" She goes, \"I do.\" I said,\n\"What can I do for you?\" She says, \"You can turn yourself in.\" I go, \"Well, that's not gonna happen.\" I said, \"What else do you need?\" And she said, \"I think\nthat you should think about turning yourself in.\" I said, \"Why? Well, what am I looking at?\" She goes, \"Well, that's not how it works. Way it works is you turn yourself in and you know, we take\nthat into consideration.\" I said, \"Mo, no, no, no. I\nsaid, that's not good enough.\" I said, \"I'm not stupid enough to turn myself in and hope for the best.\" So she says, \"Well,\nlet's talk about this.\" And I said, \"Well, what am I looking at?\" And she goes, \"I don't really know. I can't, you know, really, I can't tell you that.\" And I said, \"Well, then\nwe don't really have anything to talk about.\" She goes, \"Well, wait a second.\" She said, \"Let me, hold on,\nlet me call the US Attorney. Maybe we can work something out.\" So she calls the USD. So I said, \"Okay, I'll call you back.\" And she said, \"Well give you your phone\nnumber, I'll call you.\" And I went, \"No, no.\" I\nsaid, \"I'll call you.\" I said, \"I'm gonna hang up the phone. I'm gonna turn the phone off.\" I said, \"For all I know,\nyou're triangulating this phone call right now\nor something, you know.\" And she goes, \"Oh, give me a break.\" She goes, \"You're not that important.\" And I remember thinking,\nwho do you think you are? Like, she, like, right. Like you're just some little\nfraudster guy running around, you know, like, you're not a terrorist. You know, like, and I almost, I almost was like, \"Oh,\nokay, here's my number,\" which she probably already had. But I almost like, was like, \"Oh, okay, I'll wait for your\ncall,\" and left my phone. I said, \"No, you know what?\" I said, \"I'm gonna hang up the phone. I'm gonna turn off anyway,\nand I'll call you back.\" She's, \"All right. Whatever.\" I hang up, I turn off the phone. It turns out I found out later when I ordered the Freedom\nof Information Act. She actually immediately\ncalled the US Marshals. And they immediately called,\ntook the phone number and tracked back the phone and immediately had two\nmarshals from Baton Rouge, go immediately to the\nplace where I had been. - Damn.\n- Oh, listen. Yeah. I mean-\n- They work fast. - Yeah, she's, oh.\n- And she's good too. - Not just that. I made the initial calls\nsitting there in that, where I went and bought the phone. It was like a gas station. There was also like a Subway station. I had ordered like a Subway,\nI was eating a Subway, playing on my computer, programmed the phone\nand making phone calls. So by the time I talk to her, and they're driving,\nby that point, I walked and gotten into the vehicle,\nmy vehicle, and I leave. But, you know, who knows? I don't know if they\nshowed up 30 minutes late. I don't know. Like, I could have hung out, like, oh, I'm just gonna finish my food. Could have shown up. So I go, I call her back\nan hour or two later. She says, \"Listen,\" you know, the first time he wasn't,\nhadn't got back with her. Then he did, then he came\nback, he said, seven years, he's gotta turn himself in here. So, okay, seven years.\nThat seems like a lot. And I was like, seven years. And that's seven years for, I go, and I kept saying, \"Is that\nseven years for everything?\" And she goes, \"Yeah,\nthat's for everything.\" I was like, \"That's everything. Like, everything in that\nhappened, like in Atlanta, like and some stuff that\nyou don't know about.\" She said, \"Look, what's important is you turn yourself in, in Tampa.\" And I was like, \"Okay,\nwell, I'm closer to Atlanta, why wouldn't I turn myself in in Atlanta?\" And she's like, \"Look, you\nknow, you don't wanna do that. You don't wanna do that.\" Well, 'cause that would've been, the Secret Service would've gotten credit if I'd walked in there, right? So, you know, and I don't\nknow anything about rivalries and how they work at that time, I do now. But, so we go back and\nforth, back and forth, and I continually ask her, \"Does that include\nAtlanta and everything?\" And at some point I realized like, oh, she's just not answering. And so finally I said, \"Listen, you keep dodging this question.\" And she said, \"All I\ncan speak for is Tampa. So if you come back to Tampa and you cooperate against\neveryone seven years.\" And she's telling me she wants me to cooperate against my ex-wife. And I'm like, I'm not gonna do that. I said, \"My ex-wife didn't do anything. She doesn't know anything.\nShe didn't do anything. She's never,\" you know, \"Well,\nthat's not what I heard.\" And she's going on and on. And I was like, \"No, no.\" I was like, \"Oh, wow.\" I was like, \"So that's just for,\" and she's like, \"That's right.\" I said, \"All right, we're done. She goes, \"Mo, wait, I can\ncall the Atlanta US Attorney.\" I said, \"Nah, lady, I wouldn't believe you if you told me water was\nwet, I don't trust you.\" And I hung up the phone,\nthrew it out the window, and I end up going to Charlotte, drop off the U-Haul van, go to my, I never, I would've\nactually brought it back to the dealer. It's not like I abandoned,\nI brought it back. So I bring it back. I go to my old apartment\nin downtown Charlotte, and I remember thinking I would be okay. And I know by this point that they knew Michael Eckert's name. They had the address in Charlotte. So I know they, by this point,\nit's been five, six days. So I know they've tracked him back there. So I figured if I could\nget my car, I'm fine. So I go into the apartment complex and it, you know, it's\none of those four or five, six story apartment. You know, those are parking\nthings that stack up. So I go into this, you know, underground, it's not underground, but whatever, this parking garage thing. So I go in, I'm on like the\nthird floor or something. I look at my car, you\nknow, and I get in my car and I remember as soon as I walk, drove out of the parking garage, I\nwas like, \"Whew, I'm good.\" So I can go ahead and\npull across the street and stop at Starbucks. So I stop at Starbucks,\nI walk into Starbucks. I order Starbucks. I'm standing there\nwaiting for the barista. I look over and it's two people from the apartment complex staring at me. Like, that's, I'm like,\nand they're whispering and pointing and none. And I remember thinking, this is like the fifth of the month. I hadn't paid my rent.\nI hadn't been there. So I thought that.\n- All right, makes sense. - Yeah, this, maybe they, like, I'm picturing an eviction notice or a three day notice\non my door or something. And I'm like, okay. And then one of them bolts\nout the back, the woman, there's a guy and a girl. The woman runs out the back. He's standing there staring at me. I get my venti vanilla latte, right? I get my little, I get my fru fru drink. So I got my fru fru drink. I walk out, I get into\nthe car, he follows me, get in the car, I set everything up. I put my seatbelt on. I'm okay. He's standing there staring at me. You know, I'm thinking something's\nwrong, like, what's up? And all of, and I check\nto see there's no traffic. I'm good. I'm about to, about to leave. And he starts screaming, \"He's\nright here. He's right here.\" I look in the rear view mirror. There's two guys running\ntowards the back of my car. I punch it and I take\noff. Sounds dramatic. Wasn't that dramatic. I'd\nalready, there was no cars. I knew there was no cars\nalready pulling out, you know, it wasn't like a TJ Hooker where I jumped over the, slid across the hood and you know, they didn't catch the car and hang onto the back. But, you know, so they're\nrunning and I boom, hit it. (Matt imitates tires screeching) - Did you spill the coffee or? - No, 'cause it was one\nof those little things. It was actually nice.\nBut, but it just sounded- - You're making it sound\nlike you were pretty calm. Weren't you panicking here? - I was terrified. - Yeah.\n- Terrified. - So what, you're under fear,\nyou're still operating like- - Yeah, I operate, like I-\n- Calmly. - It's funny you say that, because the Secret Service, when they talk to these guys, they, all\nthe people that they spoke with said the same thing\nover and over again. \"The guy was a professional.\nHe never seemed upset. He never seemed agitated. He always, he was never in a hurry.\" - Yeah.\n- He, you know, like, but most of the time, I wasn't because I, you know, it wasn't until the police got involved, or, so the law en federal\nlaw enforcement got involved that I started really,\nyou know, getting anxious. So at that point, I drive, I take off, I drive about a mile down the road. - Who were the two guys, by the way? Was it-\n- I thought it was FBI. I ordered the Freedom of Information Act when I got to prison at some point, you know, in the future. And it was US Marshals, right? So-\n- Sounds pretty dramatic to me, US Marshals\nrunning towards your car, you pull, I mean- - I mean,\n- Yeah, but it's all right. - It's hard not to tell\nit like it's dramatic. - I understand It was, there was not much traffic, goes. Okay.\n- Yeah, it's not like their, you know, their fingers were at the back of the car, they're holding on, you\nknow, but it was, yeah. If I had waited an extra 20 seconds, yeah, they would've been on my car. They would've been\nright there at the door. - Did you consider giving up there, or no? - No. All I could think of was haul. Listen, my instinct is get out is go, go, go, go, go, go. - You're already on the run.\n- I'm already in trouble. It's not like they're\ngonna be, they're gonna, it's, they're gonna add anything. Although, to be honest,\nyou know, it only got worse because at that point,\nactually at that point, I drive down the road, I\nstop at a homeless facility. I survey three guys. I'm a mile down the road, like looking back on, I\nthink, what were you thinking? But there were three, three homeless guys that were in their early 30s. And they were, they were all\nCaucasian. That's hard to find. So trust me, I've looked, spent hours before track and finding these guys. - So that's like the golden\nthing you're looking for is, white guys in their 30s.\n- Right. Because that's, I was in my thirties, I wasn't an old man like I am now. So I survey them, I drive\nstraight to Nashville. Get to Nashville. Drive through\nan area called Green Hills. Well, at first, when I got to\nNashville, I stayed the night. And the next day I went into,\nI'm gonna say a UPS store. It was actually a Kinko's. There used to be some, they\nused to be called Kinko's. - But I go-\n- I remember Kinko's. - Oh yeah.\n- They got bought by FedEx, I feel like.\n- Oh, is it FedEx? FedEx, okay. Then it was a FedEx store. - So I go in there.\n- Oh, Kinko's. - And you give them like\n50 bucks or something, or 20 bucks or something. They'd give you like a\nhundred business cards. So I go get a burn, a phone\nnumber, a burner phone. I go in there, I make up, oh, I call and get a phone number\nfrom HQ, the local HQ. I come up with a name\nmanufactured funding group. I've got two phone numbers. I get business cards made with a name. One of the guys named that I surveyed was, his actual name was\nJoseph Marion Carter Jr. I went by Carter. So I get business cards\nmade of Joseph Carter. I then drive through Green Hills, took them like an hour to get the card. So I'm driving through Green Hills. I'm planning on going to an apartment, but I'm still, I don't have\nan ID, I don't have anything. Like I'm wondering how,\nwhat am I gonna do? How am I gonna get a place to stay? I'm gonna stay in a hotel.\nLike, what am I doing? I'm using an a, an ID that\nthe cops are looking for. So as I'm driving, trying to find this big apartment complex, there's a guy putting a\nsign in the front yard of like a townhouse. 'Cause several townhouses, and I probably in his 60s, I pull in, jump outta the car, and I\nsaid, \"Hey, is this for rent?\" He said, \"Yes it is.\"\nAnd I said, \"Oh, okay. Yeah. Can I see it?\" \"Sure,\" I go in, check it out, come back downstairs, it's perfect. I said, listen, you know, I\nwork for a company, you know, manufactured funding\ngroup, boom hand him thing. I said, \"I've been in, in Europe for the last,\" I forget what I said. I said, \"England,\" I\nsaid, \"Little town outside of London in, you know,\nwhatever, Dexter, you know, London for the past five years. I don't really have any credit. But I said, I can put down\ndouble the security deposit or, you know, whatever you need. Here's my business card.\" He looked at me and he looked at my car and he goes, \"You look\nlike an honest young man.\" He said, \"I'll, take\nthe first month's rent and a deposit.\" And he said, \"Now go\nget a lease right now.\" And I said, \"Okay.\" And I said, \"Oh, okay.\" Filled out a lease right\nthen, gave me the keys. Like nice, like very\ntrusting in that town. - Well that went, oh yeah. But there must have been\nalso something about you where you're just. - I mean, I don't-\n- Got a nice car. - Look, I know what you're,\nyou're gonna get a lot of comments that say white privilege. But that's what, that's what you're- - I think the charisma has\nsomething to do with it, yeah. - Well, so he gave, I appreciate that. So he gave me the keys. Listen, I ordered all of Joseph Carter's vital information, right? Like all of his birth\ncertificate, Social Security card, everything that night from like a Kinko's or some of the, I forget where, but from some one of these\nplaces I went online. You could go online back then, right? Like, there wasn't wifi everywhere. So I ordered the stuff, it\nshows up a couple days later. I take that information, I go and I get a driver's license. We're talking about within like seven or eight days, I've got a\ndriver's license in his name. I get in that car, Michael Eckert's car. I drive it all the way back to Nashville. I leave it in long-term\nparking, get on a plane, fly back to Nashville, go in\nand buy myself a brand new car. It wasn't brand new, it\nwas a couple years old. But from like CarMax,\nwent in, within two weeks, I'm completely 100% set up. I start dating for three, four months. That gets really boring. - Where again? In Nashville you said? - Nashville.\n- Okay, got it. - So I started dating a bunch of chicks, and then I end up meeting this one girl. - By the way, are you lonely here? 'Cause you're on the run, is that? - Man, listen, being, I'm\ntelling you right now, being on the run was the\nbest part of my life. - Really?\n- Everybody, you know how all these guys say, \"It was horrible. And I was always so concerned\nand looking over my shoulder,\" and it wasn't, I wasn't,\nkeep in mind, I've gotten, I've gotten five or six traffic\ntickets while on the run. I went to traffic school as someone else. I got so many traffic tickets in his name. I went to traffic school as him. Like, if I got pulled over,\nlike, I'm not concerned. - So your confidence just was over the top.\n- And I'm driving a vehicle in the name of the driver's\nlicense that I have that was issued by that state. Yeah. Full coverage\ninsurance. I'm not an idiot. I'm not driving around a stolen car with a broken taillight\nand a body in the trunk. Like I'm covered. Like, I'm not concerned\nabout the local cops. - Plus you're gonna\nStarbucks sipping your coffee and driving away from US Marshall. - Right, right. That was-\n- You could start believing that it's impossible to catch you. That is exactly what it is. It's every time I just kept getting more and more emboldened, more\nand more cocky, arrogant. Like, they're not gonna\ncatch. I'm too good. You know, which is great\nuntil they catch you. And so I meet a girl named Amanda Gardner. Well, what I end up\ndoing is, keep in mind, I've only got 100,000 or so. So I go and I start buying houses in the area in this area called JC Napier next to, it's just close to downtown. And I buy these houses and I start record. I buy them for like 60, 70,000. And I record the sales at 210, 190, 205, that sort of thing. Same thing. And I refinance the houses. I start pulling out money. I meet this girl, Amanda Gardner. We hit it off within a few months. She's moved in to, we move\ninto a house in that area. I renovate a house. We move in there. I borrow three and a half million dollars. And I'm buying houses now. I'm buying houses, recording the value. I started all over, you know,\nI borrow like, whatever, three and a half million dollars. I meet Amanda, we move in together. We're buying-\n- Do you tell her? Do you tell her about what you- - She kind of, you know,\nwhat she knew was that, you know, it's odd, right? I have no photographs.\nEverything I own is brand new. She's like, \"You don't,\nthere's nothing in this house that's more than four months old. So six months old, you\nhave no photographs, you have no internet presence,\nyou have no, you know, it's, every stick of clothing is brand new. You don't have old pairs of jeans.\" - Do do you tell their\nstories about the past of any, like is there a fabricated - Initially there was a fabricated version that I owned a, I owned\na mortgage company. My typical story was like\nI owned a mortgage company and I got bought out by Household Bank, started doing very well. I got bought out by Household Bank. I have a no non-compete clause. I got, you know, I ended up\nwith like half a million dollars after paying off all my bills and just decided to kind\nof travel around the US And now I'm here, I'm gonna\nstart renovating houses. But that, you know, you don't call home, nobody calls you, your\nfamily doesn't call you. You tell stories about your\nmom, your dad, your brother, your sister, friends. I don't know any of these friends. Never seen any of these friends. They never call you. They never, you know, it's\njust like, it's like, ah shit. So at some point, I\nbasically just said to her, \"Look, I am,\" listen, at one point I had to have a check cut. I refinanced the house, right? And I had like, I wanna say,\nI'm gonna say something like, it might have been 30,000,\nbut let's say 20,000. I had a $20,000 check\ncut to Amanda Gardner. 'Cause you have to have these checks. You can't have them cut to me. So I would say, \"Hey, there's\na second mortgage on there.\" And I'd provide a second mortgage or I'd provide, you know,\nI'd provide different things. And I knew if I need names of people to cut these things to. So I had a check cut for whatever. So I remember we're at dinner one night. This is before she really knows who I am. And I said, \"Hey.\" I said, \"Oh.\" And she goes, \"Oh, did\nyou had a refinance?\" She said, \"How'd that\nthing go? You refinance?\" I go, \"Oh, thank God you said that.\" Boom. I said, \"I need you to deposit this.\" Give a check for 20,000. She's like, \"I can, I can go tomorrow. And I can deposit it and I,\" and I'm like, \"No, no.\" I'm like, \"Look it,\nit's fine, just deposit it.\" She says, \"I can get,\nas soon as it clears, I'll get you a cashier's check.\" I was like, \"No, just deposit\nit and keep it in your bank. It's fine.\" So she's like, \"What is going on?\" You know, and so we have this conversation and I tell her, \"Look,\npeople are looking for me.\" \"Who?\" \"Law enforcement.\" \"Which ones?\" \"All of\nthem,\" you know, she's like, \"Tat doesn't even, for what?\" I go, \"Mostly bank fraud.\" And she's like, \"Well, how\nare they not finding you? I mean, everybody, you know,\npeople know you like, you know, your general contractor, which\nI met four months before. This guy six months\nbefore, two months before.\" You know, she's like, \"So and so, so and so, so,\" and I'm\nlike, \"Right, right. Well,\" I said, \"Well,\" she's like, \"I mean, they've got your name, they've got your,\" I go,\n\"Well, that's identity theft.\" And she was like, \"What do you mean?\" I said, \"Well, my name's\nnot, you know, my name's not, it's not Joseph Carter.\" \"And what is your name?\nWhat is your name?\" I go, \"Look, you know, you don't need, don't even worry about it. This is what's happening.\nThis is where I'm at.\" And this has been months\ninto the relationship. I mean, this is, or I'd say\nmaybe a month or two in. But you know, she was\njust too inquisitive. And, oh, I know what it was. She found like $40,000 in cash in my freezer one night. That was another thing that happened. She went to get a Popsicle and she opened up the\nflip to get a Popsicle. And she opened the wrong\none and there was all cash. And she was like, like,\nyou know, \"The other day,\" you know, in this\nconversation, \"The other day, I opened up the Popsicle\nbox and there's cash.\" And I'm like, so I kind of explain it, but I had a feeling she's not gonna, she's gonna be okay with this, you know? - So she was okay.\n- She was okay with this. - I mean, to me, that's just a fascinating conversation to have. Like. - It was a great conversation. - 'Cause oftentimes in relationships, you learn about each other\nand you find out new things. And here you find out-\n- That's a doozy. - Yeah, it's a good one to find out. (Lex laughs) The name you're using\nis not your real name. And the secret service, the FBI and everybody else are looking for you. - Yeah.\n- And you're like, to be honest, you're\nnot a violent criminal. So it's like,\n- And I, you know. - You know.\n- But she didn't know my name. Like, she was like, she, and I told her, I said,\n\"Look, if you start digging, if you find out my name, like I'll leave.\" Like, there's certain\nthings that catch you staying in contact with\npeople that, you know, that's how you get caught. You know, going back to see people, that's how you get caught, you know, telling people who you are, that's how you get caught. And I was like, \"So, I'm Joseph\nCarter, everything's fine.\" And she was like, \"Okay,\" you know, and keep in mind too, this girl, do you, \"Oh, your car's broken, or\nyour car's not doing well? Take it and trade it in. We'll go get you another car. We'll go get you, you know,\nan Infinity, you know, FX or whatever, you know, a\n55,000, $60,000 vehicle.\" She's driving the equivalent\nof a beat up old Nova. You know, I mean, it's, you wanna go on vacation,\nwe'll go on vacation. You wanna do this, you wanna do that?\" So, you know, we're buying\nhouses, we're renovating houses. We're building brand new\nhouses. We're buying lots. Like, she's like in the middle\nof this, like holy Jesus, there's hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank,\nin our bank account. Her bank account. I open up\na corporation in her name. She's opening up bank accounts, she's got web, there's websites. It's a lot. And while this is happening, we start seeing a friend of hers. So this other girl comes in\nthe picture, her name's Trina. And Trina is semi lesbian. So-\n- Is this like a sexual thing? - Yeah.\n- Or actual relationship? - No, it's, no, it's more like a, she's coming over a couple times a week. - Okay.\n- So we've got a ton of tons going on. And, how do you put this? So while this is happening,\nI end up coming out in like several magazines. So I'm thinking this\nwhole thing's dying down, but it's not dying down because now I just got caught\nand handcuffed in a bank, walked outta the police\nstation, outran Marshalls. Although that part, the Marshall thing never was never in the papers. But the getting caught and handcuffed in the bank, when that hit the papers,\nthat's everywhere, bro. That's huge, you know. Suddenly \"Chicago\nTribune's\" running a series, \"The Fugitives,\" I'm in\n\"Bloomberg Business Week,\" they run an article called, you know, \"Sharks In The Housing Pool.\" Then you've got a \"Fortune\nMagazine\" comes out with a thing, because by now, guess what? Becky's been caught. - Oh, Becky.\n- Becky. Oh, Becky. - [Lex] Is she in Houston or whatever? - In Houston, got caught.\n- And did she? - But gangster, bro. Like the way she, here's the thing. - [lex[ Hey. Hey. There you go. - No. Oh no. She told on me immediately. - Oh, she did? Oh no.\n- Yeah. It's fine, she did the right thing. So here's what's funny about that though. - I don't know about that. - [Matt] She, here's what she says. - Loyalty is everything\nin this world, my friend that you and I disagree on. - I just took off. I just took off - Still.\n- On her and left her with, listen, with like six or like five or $600,000\nis what I left her with. - It's not all about money, Matthew. It's also about just like,\nyou know, ride or die. There's a meaning to that. - My God.\n- I'm sorry. Go ahead. - So-\n- She told, she said everything. - Well, here's what, when I say gangster, when she gets caught, - [Lex] Yeah. - They come in, she's in\nthe middle of beauty school. She's paid for beauty school, she's going through beauty school. She's gonna open like\na salon or something. So she's in there cutting hair in a class, you know, on a mannequin. And all of a sudden, like five or six Secret Service agents\ncome in, guns drawn, screaming, \"Get on the ground, get on the ground.\" She said, \"Everybody\ndropped to the ground.\" She said, \"I'm sitting there\nwith scissors going,\" you know, they grab her, they handcuff\nher, they bring her in. And the whole time. Now, at\nthat point, she was Rebecca, well she was, yeah, her\nname was Rebecca Hickey. She went by Becca. So she's\nRebecca Hickey, which is a, you know, she's got a\nTexas driver's license, the whole thing. And they're screaming at her and they put her in the car and they're driving the whole way. She goes, \"Listen,\" the guy, the Secret service agent\ntold me 45 minutes, she's telling us, \"You're\nlosing your job, bro. You're losing.\" I mean, he goes, he's like,\n\"I couldn't believe it. Like we've got pictures of her. We're like, 'This is you.'\nShe's like, 'That's not me. Are you insane? Look at\nthat chubby little thing.'\" I mean, like she's just. Would not budge till they\nactually put her hand on the scanner. And she goes, \"okay, I'm Rebecca\nHauck. What do you need?\" They're like, \"Where's Matt Cox?\" She's like, \"I have no idea. That fucker left me like a year ago.\" So.\n(Lex laughs) so.\n- But she contributed to the story, to the legend\nthat's already growing. - Oh, because she was\ninterviewed by \"Fortune Magazine\" and it was horrendous. The article is horrendous. \"He was abusive, he's a Don Juan that forced me to fall in love with him, commit mortgage fraud, and\nthen took all the money and left,\" by the way, they\nfound like 40 or 50 grand on her and maybe another 30 or 40 in her bank account\nand no other money. - Yeah.\n- Where's the other money? So anyway, and she was, by\nthe way, she got caught. She was in communication with her family. So she's talking to her mom. - [Lex] That's when she\ngot caught, ultimately. - And her mother, through\nmultiple conversations, one conversation being,\n\"Mom, I'm doing fine. I can't tell you where\nI am, you know, exactly. But I'm in Houston, Texas, I'm fine.\" Next one, \"Six months later,\nI enrolled in beauty school,\" Houston, Texas Beauty School. How many are there?\n- Yep. - And her mom, bipolar. \"I just wanna see my daughter. I'm gonna call the Secret Service.\" - Yep.\n- \"I'm doing the right thing.\" And honestly, she is\ndoing the right thing. So-\n- So you're getting more and more famous. - It's bad.\n- Nationally. - [Matt] Right. So I've\ngot all these houses. - You're having a threesome\nwith Amanda and Trina. - And what ends up happening\nis we end up going on, you know, and listen,\nAmanda and I, we've gone on, we've gone to Greece, Italy, Croatia, we've gone,\nwe're going on multiple, just multiple trips. And when we had just gotten\nback from like a 10 day cruise of the Greek Isles, and, there's, we get home\nand Amanda goes online and there's a blog about\n\"Dateline,\" about their, one of their new specials\ncalled \"The Thief Of Hearts.\" And that's me. Apparently\nI'm the thief of hearts. And I'm apparently going around and I'm, and it's based on, you\nknow, Rebecca's, you know, Becky's story that I'm\nwooing women to commit fraud, stealing all the money, and then leaving them to hold the bag. Well, they interviewed her. They're interviewing multiple people, multiple in my case,\nthey put together this, they're putting together an\nepisode, gonna be released in a few, in a month or so. So I'm terrified, I've, at this point, I've been on the run three years, and I'm like, I mean, there's\nlots of things I could care less about \"Fortune,\" I don't know anybody that reads \"Fortune,\"\n\"Bloomberg,\" come on. I hang out with, I'm\nhanging out with contractors and laborers and you know, I'm not hanging out with these guys. So, you know, local news, who cares? You know, even, even local news channels, you know, I don't care. But \"Dateline,\" there weren't\n400 channels back then, you know, so \"Dateline\" comes out, even if you don't see it the first time, they're gonna rerun it in\nthree months or six months, or five year, 10 years from\nnow, they might rerun it again. My face is gonna be on it.\nSo I could be perfectly fine. Five years from now and one\nday, the barista that I go to every other day looks at \"Dateline\" and goes, \"Oh my God, that's Mr. Johnson,\" or \"That's Mr. Thomas,\" or whatever. So the point is, is that I\nwas like, \"Yeah, I gotta go. I can't stay here. I gotta\nget outta the country.\" So I was gonna go to, well, we\nreally started doing research and Amanda ended up saying, Australia. Australia, at the time, I\ndon't know how it is now, but at the time, if you went to Australia with like $100,000 and a business plan, you could become a permanent resident alien. You can't vote. But you can buy property, you can open a business,\nbut you can't get a job. And they didn't require our fingerprints. So there's no criminal background check. Now, if you wanted to be a citizen, you have to get an FBI\ncriminal background check. Like I got, no, I'm good. So I was like, wow, I can go\nthere and start a business, and I'm gonna start show\nup with a couple million. So what we do is we\nstart refinancing houses, we start pulling out\nmoney as quick as we can. I'm asking guys, laborers,\nguys that I work with, my general contractor, my\nreal estate agent, \"Hey man, can you cash this check for six grand?\" You check, nobody says no, everybody. \"Yeah, no problem, no problem. No.\" A few guys like, \"Yeah,\nman, if you give you 10%.\" \"Yeah, I'll give you 10%.\" So that's happening.\nWe're pulling out cash. One day Amanda gives Trina a bunch of checks and asks her to cash them. That sparks a conversation that\nlike what it was happening. She confides in. By this point, by the way,\nAmanda knows who I am. So by this point, she's\nactually came across the letter that I wrote to my\nparents when I left Tampa. So she's figured out who I am. She tells Trina, \"His name's Matt Cox, 'Dateline's' coming out,\nwe're gonna, we're leaving. We gotta get a bunch of cash.\" And Trina goes, \"Okay,\nI'll cash the checks.\" And what she does instead is\nshe calls the Secret Service, they watch my house for three days, I come home one day, they pull the cars up (Matt imitates brakes screeching) and they arrest me. So, you know, it's a little bit longer than that, but that's shorter. That's a short version\nof me getting arrested. And you know, I've probably\nskipped over a whole- - So simple, because you've gotten away with much more complex situations. - It's women man. It's women. Just joking. (Matt laughs) - They also are the thing\nthat make life worthwhile. - Listen, God bless Trina,\nshe did the right thing. It, honestly, based on-\n- There you go back to the right thing. - But I mean, based on what she saw, based on what the Secret Service told her and what then the articles\nthat she's reading, I'm a bad guy. I mean, I'm a bad guy in general, right? So I don't deserve\nloyalty, I don't think so. I'm ripping people off and she's thinking that her\nfriend is in danger, you know, the FBI is saying, I have a weapon. \"He's dangerous. He's got a weapon.\" You know, \"We believe\nhe's armed and dangerous.\" When I was in Florida, I had\na concealed weapons permit, but I had gotten rid of both my guns when I was placed on probation. I've never had one since. I've\nnever touched a gun since. But they used that to\nsay, you know, they said, \"Oh, he had a concealed weapons permit. Okay, well then he's armed and dangerous\" Like, there's these little things and things they're telling\nher, \"Read this article. Look, he forces girls to\nfall in love with them. That's what he's gonna do to your friend.\" So she negotiated a also,\nI think she got 10,000, I think, which is embarrassing. I'm ashamed that she got $10,000. - And said everything. - Yeah, and told them,\n\"This is where he is. His name is Joseph Carter.\" You know, \"This is where he is.\" They watch it, they\ngrab me, they arrest me. They bring me downtown. You know.\n- What did you feel like when you got.\n- I didn't feel good, bro. It was bad. It was a bad\nday. It was a bad day. First of all, \"Casino Royale\"\nwas coming out on Friday. It was the first Daniel\nCraig as James Bond. And the whole week I'd\nbeen telling Amanda, \"I'm gonna go see 'Casino Royale.'\" She go, \"Okay, well on Saturday we're gonna go to the festival.\" I go, \"That's fine, but\non Friday 'Casino.'\" And she's like, \"Right, 'Casino Royale.'\" And then she's like, \"Okay, by the way, on Thursday, I thought\nwe could go to dinner.\" \"That's fine. But on\nFriday, 'Casino Royale.'\" And when they put the handcuffs on me, one of the first thing I thought of, I'm not gonna fucking see \"Casino Royale.\" I'm not gonna get to see\nit. Not gonna see it. And I saw it about five, six years later and when on the\ninstitution's movie channel, you know, it was nice. It's not the same. But yeah, so they bring me to Nashville, then they transport me\nto all over the place. I go on, you know, Con Air,\nthey fly me to Oklahoma, they fly me to Atlanta. Then I go to Atlanta, I'm placed in the US Marshal's, holdover. I get assigned an attorney,\ngo in front of the judge, plead not guilty, meet with my attorney. You always plead not guilty. You know, whenever you ask people say, \"Can you believe that he pled not guilty?\" That's the first thing you, nobody walks in and pleads guilty. You plead not guilty while\nyou kind of figure out what you're gonna do. So I plead not guilty.\nThere's no bond, obviously. I've got, they caught\nme, when they caught me, I had four or five passports. So that's no good. They charged me with,\nyou know, bank fraud, conspiracy, commit bank\nfraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, passport fraud, conspiracy, or what was the other,\naggravated identity theft, money laundering, use of\na fraudulent passport. You know, and there's like, you know, 30 counts of this, 20 counts of this, 20. None of that matters, like\neven if you just took the, dropped all the counts to\none count stacked them, it's like 150 something years. Not that they're-\n- Yeah so everything, everything they put.\n- Yeah. And that's what they always say. \"You're looking at 150,000,\" you know, and your\nlawyers, they're like this. \"You're not looking at that.\nYou're looking at 54 years.\" What? That's no matter.\nThat's no matter. So yeah. So my lawyer comes in and sees me one day, you\nknow, like our first meeting. And I, she says, you\nknow, \"I'm Millie Dunn,\" and she says, \"Listen,\nI've looked at everything, for first they say you're responsible for, it's like 25 or 20 or 30,\n25 or $26 million in loss.\" And I'm like, \"That's, I've\nnever, that's not true. That's not true.\" And I was like, \"You\nknow, not even, I said, maybe not even potential law. There's just no way, I\nmean, there's just no way.\" And then they come back, she comes back and she says, \"Well,\nthey're saying 19 million.\" And like, \"It's not possible. Tell you anything. I don't, I didn't, no.\" So when the FBI's saying like 40 million, they're saying 11.5 in Tampa, plus 40 million for the mortgage company. So that, it ends up being like, plus what I stole on the run, it ends up being like 55 million. But she gets them to drop like the 40. Like that's just brokers. That's this, that's that. Drop it. And they're like, \"He's so\ndone. It doesn't matter.\" They drop that, so it ends\nup being like 15 million. And then it's down to what does he owe? They said, \"9.5,\" and I got\nit down to like 6 million. So, you know, which,\nyou know, I'm good for. So what ends up happening\nis they've charged me with all these things and she's like, \"Okay, you know, you're like, you can plead guilty and you can go with the\nsentencing guidelines, which is gonna be like,\" she's\nlike, \"I mean, it depends.\" She said, \"It might be whatever, 54 years\" She goes, \"But if they run\nthem, you know, concurrent or consecutive, depending\non which one they do,\" she said, \"It most likely it\nends up being like 30 years.\" You know, it's like, that's\nnot good. That's not good. So we kind of go back\nand forth, back and forth and figure out, try and figure out what I'm looking at. Now as we go through the\nwhole thing, we end up, she ends up with, she\nends up saying, you know, she knocks off a bunch of stuff\nthat they're saying I did, you know, at enhancements, because you'll have a base\nlevel enhance, a base level of let's say a level eight. You know, that should be, that\nshould be maybe a few years. But then they start adding\non enhancements, you know. \"Did he, did what he do,\nwas it sophisticated?\" Yes, okay, three levels\nfor sophisticated means. \"Were there more than, how\nmany victims were there? More than 50 victims?\" Yes. Okay. That's six more levels. Okay. \"Did he change the\njurisdiction to evade detection?\" Yes. That's four more levels. Okay. \"Did he,\" they start adding boom, boom. And when you start adding\nup all those levels, plus your criminal history, and I have a big criminal history because I was already on federal probation and I committed a new\ncrime on federal probation. So that was another enhancement. And this, you know, this case.\nSo I'm in like a category. I'm like category two or three. So they come back and they're saying, I forget, it's like 20, well, they don't come back right away, but she ends up saying, \"You're probably looking at 14 years.\" Okay. That's reasonable.\nThat's reasonable. And so she's saying, so\nwhen we get the PSI back, we eventually get what's\ncalled a pre-sentence report. They're saying 26 years. Well,\nthey really said 32 years. And I argued, and we got it down to 26 years and four months. That's what it is. It's 316 months. That's how they do it in months doesn't sting that much,\nI guess if she say months. - Yeah. - So she says to me,\nMillie sits down with me and she says, \"Listen,\nyou gotta cooperate.\" And I was like, \"Okay.\" And she said, \"Because you're guilty. You're extremely guilty.\" She's like, \"You can't go to trial.\" And she said, \"So you need to cooperate.\" I was like, \"Well, what\ndo I get if I cooperate?\" And she said, \"The way\nit works is you cooperate and you hope for the best.\" And I was like, \"Are you serious?\" \"You tell them everything you know, and you hope for the best.\" And she's like, \"What part\nof the problem is,\" she said, \"Everybody in Tampa's cooperated. Rebecca has cooperated. Everyone across the board has cooperated.\" She goes, \"There's nobody\nthat hasn't cooperated.\" - By the way, when you say cooperate you mean they're an informed, they told, they said, they AKA snitched.\n- Yeah. Right, they came in, they\nsat down with their lawyer and they said, \"This is what he did. He did this, he did that.\" They showed him documents. \"Yes, yes, yes, that's my signature. I didn't know what that was.\" You know, everything was my fault. They didn't do anything. It was all me. So they've all cooperated and\nthey haven't been charged. They've been indicted, they're all named as unnamed co-conspirators\non my indictment. So I've got like 12 people. And there's like probably\n20 people there involved, but there's like 12 of them that are, so I've got all these names,\nyou know, KB, DL, CY, you know, it's like, I know who that is. Like I know who DW, that's Dave Walker. I know who you know, I\nknow who these people are. And so there's just a list\nof, there's like 12 of them, you know, plus me. So, and some of them walked\nin and said, \"I'm guilty. I just wanna be plead guilty.\" The girl, Alison, she walked in, said, \"I'm too, I'm tired of waiting for you to come get me.\" Walked in with her lawyer and said, \"I just wanna plead guilty.\" And they sentenced her\nand she went to jail. She got like 36 months or 30 months. She called the prison. She went to the low security,\nit was a female prison at the time, female camp. Called the camp and asked\nfor if she could come by for a tour before she went. And they went, \"Excuse me?\" She said, \"Well, I'm going to be there for about two years,\nso I'd like to come in. Is there like a tour I can take? 'Cause I like to know where I'm going and what it's gonna be\nlike, how I should prepare.\" And they just started laughing. They said, \"There's no tour, sweetie. We'll give you the tour\nwhen you get here.\" (Matt laughs) You gotta love that. Like, she- - [Lex] Yeah, I mean.\n- I thought I was, I didn't think, I thought\nI was not prepared. I mean, there's no tour.\n(Lex laughs) - So Becky, Becky got 70 months, but when I got caught\nand when I was sentenced, they reduced it to like 30 or no, 40 to 40 months they reduced. - 'Cause she cooperated.\n- Cooperated. - That term. Right. - Do you want to say snitched or ratted?\n- Well, there must be, I mean, snitch is too harsh of a word, but yeah, the ratted, I mean, you're saying, I don't know. - Well, we can get there. We'll get there. - All right. All right. So where did the sentencing end up? - So I should say first on the cooperation. - Yeah.\n- Subject. My lawyer wanted me to cooperate. And by this point I realized like, you don't have a choice, you know? No, that's not true. I\ncould have been a gangster. - Yeah.\n- What does it mean to be a gangster in this case? - Like a standup guy. I could have said, I'll just take it, give me 54 years, go fuck yourself. I'm not gonna snitch on nobody. And I know you look at me\nand you think, tough guy. I'm not a tough guy at all. I'm not doing 50 some odd years. Like, I'm not doing it. I don't wanna do 30 years,\nyou know, I was hoping for, you know, I knew it wasn't possible, but I would've satisfied\nfirst another slap on the hand like I got the first time. I really thought I deserved, honestly, when you,\nwhen my lawyer asked me, \"What do you really think you deserve?\" And I thought, I deserve 10 years, you know, I deserve 10 years. But, so she said, \"Look,\nthey wanna talk to you.\" So the FBI, well, first,\nthe Secret Service flies in. They come in and they interview me. - Who's more terrifying?\nFBI, Secret Service? - You know, the Secret Service was so overwhelmingly professional. the FBI, and really only,\none of the FBI agents that interviewed me, I don't\nknow how he's an agent. I don't know. He was just\nineffective, incompetent. - [Lex] Oh, so it's a competence issue. - The other one was Candace. - Oh, you met her eventually.\n- Of course I did. Of course, she's-\n- But what was her open line? - 511 wearing three inch heels. - Yeah.\n- She's a giant and in impeccable shape, attractive. One of the angriest human\nbeings I've ever met. And every FBI agent that I've\nmet since then that knows her, and I've mentioned, they all say, \"Oh, what you think of her?\" And I'm like, \"What? Why?\" They go, and I was like,\n\"Kind of aggressive.\" They go, \"Yeah, yeah, she's a bulldog.\" I mean, all of them are like, \"Yeah, yeah. She's something else.\" Like-\n- Secret Service is a little bit more like professional. - Very personally, very,\nyou know, it's their job. It's like, \"Hey, this is just my job.\" They're polite, professional,\nyou know, that's it. So it's just, this is just\na, this is my nine to five. So, but they come and they fly in and they meet with me\nfor three, four days. One of the funny things is that when I first first sat down with them, the one guy's name was Dan,\nlike Broskowski or something. So, he sits down and he says,\n\"Look, before we get started, we need to talk about something.\" And I said, \"What?\" He said, \"We know you've hidden money and we,\" you know, and I was like, \"What?\" And he goes, \"You know, we\nknow you've got money hidden.\" I said, \"I don't have any money hidden. What are you talking about?\" And my lawyer's like,\n\"Do we need to talk?\" I'm like, \"No, no, no,\nno. I don't have nothing. I gave you everything. I gave you all the accounts,\nyou got everything.\" And he's like, \"You're looking at an obstruction charge at this point.\" I was like, \"I don't have anything.\" And he says, \"We know you have money. We know you have money in different IDs, different identities names.\" And I go, \"What are you talking about?\" And he pulls out a bank statement and he slaps it on the counter. And he goes, \"You've got money in Southern Exchange Bank. You've got $190,000 in\nSouthern Exchange Bank.\" And I look at it, and I went, and it was in the name Walter Hulk. And I went, \"Did you call the bank?\" He says, \"Yeah, we called the bank.\" I went, \"Okay, did anybody call you back?\" And they go, he said, \"Well, no, we've left several messages.\" I said, \"Did you go to the bank website? He goes, \"Yeah, I went to the website.\" I said, \"What'd you think?\" And he went, \"What do you\nmean, it was a bank website?\" I said, \"Yeah, but it\nwas professional, right? It was like a professional website.\" And he goes, \"It's a bank website.\" And I go, \"Yeah, but\nit's, it was well done.\" And he goes, \"Oh God.\" And I go, \"Yeah, convincing.\" And I went, I go, \"It's all an illusion.\" And I said, \"The bank doesn't\nexist. It's a fake bank. I made the bank, made it when\nI was in, not even in Tampa. I think I got into\nNashville when I made it.\" And I was like, yeah, it's an illusion, the bank statements.\" He's like, \"They're\ncolor bank statements.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, well, no shit.\" So, you know, there's no,\nI said, \"A matter of fact,\" I said, \"Who did you leave a, I haven't paid for the service in months.\" And he turned around and he called it and it went, you know. (Matt imitates dead phone ringtone) you know, it was disconnected. And I was like, \"How do you\nnot know that's a bank?\" Well, it turns out there was\na Southern Exchange Bank, and I'd used their bank routing number. And so, I mean, I always thought\nthat was funny that they, it was like, well, I remember really for a split second there, I was kind of like really embarrassed\nthat they called me. I was like, I can't believe\nthis, you're the Secret Service. Anyway, I talked to them. I, you know, there's, there's really, as far as the Secret Service is concerned, there's just not much I can tell them. There's just, you know, like it was me. Becky's already told them everything. Amanda's already told them everything. It's not hard to track. Now when they raided my house, they've got boxes and boxes. So it's laid out. We\nstill, it took forever. Like I still went through everything. I explained how I got\nthe driver's licenses, how I made the bank statements, how I made the birth certificates, how I, the whole social\nengineering of figuring out how to, what these little loopholes are. It's like seven days\ntotal with these guys. So. - You mean like in like question? - Yeah, it was like, they\nquestioned me for all day, and then they take me back\nto the Marshalls holdover, and then the next morning I wake up and they chain me up\nagain and bring me back. - What's that like? What's that process of questioning? Like, are they, I mean, you're somebody who is exceptionally good at\nconversation, charismatic, it was part of the games you played. Are they good at conversation? - I mean, you know, the problem is, they're not there to shoot the shit. You see what I'm saying? Like, they have an agenda. - But they have to use their words to get information outta you. Aren't they trying to manipulate you? - I'm not holding anything back. - Okay.\n- I'm not, it's not like I'm sparing Jim, you know, it's trust me, Jim's gotta go. I mean, you're looking at,\nyou're there 20 some odd years, but Jim can do five. Bill can do some, Tom can do six. I don't even like, I\ndon't even like Jerry, Jerry can do 20, you\nknow, so I'm ready to, I'm ready to cut everybody's throat. - But you're not guaranteed\nthat, that you're not, you're getting anything for that. - Right, and all my\ntime, I've seen one time where an inmate got a guarantee\nto have his sentence reduced and it was signed by the head of the FBI, was Robert Mueller, gave it to him to have a conversation with him. That's the only time I've\never seen that document. - Okay, so a lot of days with both the Secret Service and the FBI. - So FBI was, Candace was\nirritated, didn't like me. And I remember when I, she took the cuffs off, I\nwas like rubbing my wrist. She goes, \"Your wrists hurt.\" And I go, \"Yeah.\" And she goes, \"Get used to it.\" I mean, she was just an asshole. - Yeah.\n- Just all around. Not that she didn't have a right to be, but everybody else was professional. - Yeah.\n- So. (Matt laughs)\n- Oh, Candace. - So we, you know, we talked\nfor three or four days with the FBI. And you know, they asked\na ton of questions. They brought a ton of, they\nbrought documents, you know, so it's like, \"Hey, who signed this?\" You know, it's like, \"Oh,\nthat's not my signature. That's so-and-so's signature.\" Or \"I signed that. I\nsigned that. I signed that. That's so-and-so.\" \"Where'd this check go? Who is this?\" \"Oh, that's so-and-so,\" you know, you're looking over everything. One of the things they\nwanted to know about was, which I never talked\nabout, 'cause it seems, seems so minor, is I\nbribed the politician. I got him elected because we got him elected\nto the city council so he could vote to get the lots, we bought like a hundred\nvacant lots in Ybor City. And I wanted them all, they\nwere all single family. We wanted them zoned multifamily. And so we bribed him and got him elected. - That doesn't seem minor. - It's not as sexy as the rest of stuff. - That's pretty, I mean,\n- That's a whole nother thing. Like I mean, you know.\n- All right. - So what happened is when they got all of the bank accounts, they see all these checks\ngoing to Kevin White. And so they're like, \"Why did James Red donate $500 to Kevin White? Why did Brandon Green donate?\nWhy did Allen Duncan donate? Why did,\" and you know, so I\nhad explained to him, \"Oh yeah, well, he was, we wanted\nhim to be city councilman. So we paid, you know,\ngave him a bunch of money so he could run the ads\nso he could get elected so he could then get all of our stuff.\" But because he never did, you\nknow, I took off on the run before he was able to do that. And then he ended up getting,\nnot long, too, too long after that, he ended up\nabout five, six years later, he ended up getting indicted for bribery, but not mine on somebody else's case. - Can I take a small tangent here? - Yeah.\n- And ask how many politicians do you think commit\ncrimes, are a little bit, or a lot criminals? - I mean, I think there's\nsome ways that are, you know, they're seemingly legal. - The aforementioned gray area. - Well, that's not gray. Like this guy was, like, at one point, I couldn't find anybody to\nwrite $500 checks anymore. So I just gave him cash. Like, I'm just handing him\nseven, $8,000, $10,000 in cash. So, but you know, I think most of them have legal ways\nto make ungodly amounts of money for, you know, influence. You know. But is it legal?\nNo, they're politicians. They've made it so that it's not illegal. If you really sat down and explained it to someone, you know, the average person would\nsay that's not right. That, \"Oh, no, no, that's legal.\" - So, okay, so at the\nend of these few days, what was the sentencing like? - Yeah, I end up, I go to sentencing. I get my PSI back and\nit's 32 years to life. - Yeah.\n- And so we argue about it with the prosecutor\njust before sentencing, and they get it down to\n26 years, four months. And then Millie says,\n\"Listen, don't worry, 'cause I'm trying to\nbackpedal at this point. I'm like, I might as well go to trial. If I lost at trial. I\ncouldn't get more than 30.\" You can't, well, more than 32 years. 'Cause you can't get life. 32 was the max. It's just like a mistake. He said 32 years to\nlife, you can't get life. So it was like, the most\nI can get is 32 years. So I was like, I'll go to\ntrial. Might as well go to trial and see if I can get them to reduce some of these enhancements. She insists that she can get\nthe enhancements knocked down. And if you read, they actually\nread the enhancements. Some of the enhancements,\nthey didn't apply to me. So she goes, and you know, I believed her. And I think she, she\nmade a valid argument. We get to, we go to sentencing. My mom's there, she's\ncrying. My dad's there. He's looking at me like he's disgusted and crowd, there's a\nwhole bunch of reporters, like the whole place is packed. And I'm, I plead guilty. Millie gets up, my lawyer gets up and she argues these enhancements. And every single time, you know, the judge is like, \"Eh, I disagree. You know, overruled.\" And it's like, boom, \"Five\nmore years,\" you know, bam. \"Six more years.\" Bam. 'Cause if she had won the enhancement, she argued I would've got 14 years. Now, keep in mind too, prior to this, a month or two prior to this, the US Attorney had\ncalled Millie and said, \"Look, 'Dateline,'\" \"Dateline\" had already\ncome out by the way. Remember I was worried\nabout \"Dateline\" coming out. Well, it had come out, but\nthey wanted to do a follow up because it came out like a month or two after I got arrested. And they were saying,\n\"Hey, we wanna recut it with interviews with him.\" Well, Gail McKenzie wants,\nthat's the US Attorney. She wants me to do that. And she says, \"I'll consider\nthat substantial assistance.\" Now, when you cooperate\nwith the government, they consider it substantial assistance. That's what they call it. So I cooperate with you,\nit's substantial assistance. She says, \"If he's\ninterviewed by 'Dateline,' we'll consider it substantial assistance.\" And Millie says, \"You have to do it.\" - By the way, what's the idea behind that? That like, you serve as a warning for others or something like that? - Yeah, exactly, she's like, \"You know, you become a cautionary tale. Like, don't let this happen to you.\" So I go and I'm interviewed by \"Dateline,\" Keith Morris, or whatever his name is, you know that guy.\n- Yeah. - Mr. Cox was, you know, that guy? So he comes and he interviews me, Becky's interviewed, I'm interviewed. Amanda's interviewed, like\nAlison is interviewed, like everybody, the Secret service agent, I think has interviewed like everybody, prosecutor's interviewed. You know, it's funny, at\nthe time I would've, I was, when I watched it, I was like, \"That's not true, and that's not true. And that, and,\" and\nhonestly, it's like 99% true. It's like looking back on it.\n- Yeah. - You know, I'm like, you know, like, \"My Audi TT wasn't\nblue, it was silver.\" You know, it's just stupid. But anyway, so I'm interviewed by them and they recut it and they air the video. So, you said this was\nsubstantial assistance. And then the other thing\nis, I was interviewed by the FBI and the Secret Service. Now my lawyer calls the\nprosecutor the night before sentencing and says, \"Look, he was interviewed by \"Dateline\" and he was interviewed by the\nSecret Service and the FBI. And if you do that, you said\nyou'd reduce his sentence, you'd consider it substantial assistance, and you would reduce his sentence. What are you going to ask for his sentence to be tomorrow at sentencing?\" And she said, \"We did consider\nit substantial assistance and it's just not enough.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Nobody was arrested.\" \"Yes, but what about \"Dateline?\" \"Millie, I don't know what to tell you. It just wasn't enough.\" - We considered it.\n- We considered it. We will consider it. And\nthey did consider it. So.\n- Oh man. - Yeah, that's like the,\nthat's, you have to really, you know, the meaning of\nwords is so important. - I'm gonna use that at some point. I will consider it.\n- I'll consider it. - I'll consider it. I considered it.\n- It's not. (both laughing) So-\n- And still feel the same. - So she calls me, I'm crushed. And she's like, \"But look, you know, they're still investigating. They're gonna make these arrests.\" And so when you get a sentence\nreduction at sentencing, it's called a 5K one. When you get a sentence reduction after sentencing, it's called a Rule 35. So she said, \"We'll file a rule 35 as soon as the arrests are made. \"Okay.\" So I go to sentencing and Millie says, \"You're\ngonna get 14 years. I'm gonna argue these enhancements.\" She argues the enhancements,\nshe loses the enhancements. Not that she's not an amazing attorney. She's an amazing attorney.\nThe judge wanted to hammer me. He hammered me. You know,\nMillie was a great attorney. She was always polite to me. And by the way, to this day,\nwill answer my phone call. Like most public defenders,\nyou call them now, you call them after your sentence. They don't don't answer\nyour call. Great person. - Thank you, Millie.\n- I didn't give her anything to work with. You know, it's like I'm a\nlittle overwhelmingly guilty. It's like there's no defense. So I end up getting sentenced 26 years. - That's a lot of years. - I would like to tell you that they, when they gave me the time, you know, that I was stoic and I stood there and I took it in, you know, but the truth is, I cried like\na baby, like a small child. Like you've never seen anyone\ncry like this in your life. I was just, how did I get 26? How, what did I do to get 26\nyears? Like murderers, rapists. I've met guys that\nkidnapped guys that got 15. - 26.\n- So yeah. - Were you scared?\n- I mean, you know, does a pope wear a funny hat? Like of course I was\nscared, I was terrified. - Yeah.\n- I mean, you know, but I kept telling myself, \"Ah, they're gonna reduce the sentence. They'll reduce it, they'll\nreduce it, they'll reduce it. Like, okay, okay, okay.\nIt's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.\" You know, but it wasn't okay. I got sent, I got moved to Coleman, the Coleman Complex in Coleman, Florida, the Federal Correctional Coleman Complex in Coleman, Florida, which is the largest\ncomplex in the nation, federal complex in the nation. There's a, at that time, there was a camp, which was a female camp. There was a medium security,\nsorry, a low security prison for men, a medium security\nprison, and two penitentiaries. And so I get moved to the medium. Now I'm moved to the\nmedium, not because like, that's where like real\ncriminals go, right? Like I'm a soft white boy. Like, I'm no danger to anybody. Like I hurt someone's feelings once, but other than that, I'm\nnot gonna be a problem. But if you have more\nthan 20 years to serve, you have to go to a medium. So even though my security\nlevel said this guy should be in a camp, I had 20 years. So if you have, you can't go to a camp till you have less than 10. So as soon as I am given\n26 years and, you know, 26 years, they knock off three, but you still have three\nyears to get below 20. So they go to the medium. So I go to the medium and\nthere are guys getting stabbed. The very first day\npeople are being stabbed. I get locked into, you go\nto my cell, meet my cellie, they scream lockdown. Somebody got stabbed in the rec yard. I remember I asked my cellie, which I met 20 minutes earlier. I was like, \"What's, you know,\" he's like, \"Hey, we\ngotta get in the cell.\" I was like, \"What's going on?\" He goes, \"Somebody got\nstabbed in the yard.\" And I go, \"Somebody just got killed?\" And he goes, \"Nah, they just\nstabbed him up a little bit.\" And I thought, oh my\nGod, you're in a place where they say stabbed\nhim up a little bit. Like, you're not prepared for this, bro. You gotta get outta here.\n- Yeah. - So anyway, I go to the medium. I'm there. - Like, what was the first day and night? - Remember, I already had been locked up. - Yeah.\n- In the county. And they're county jails\nwhere they call them US. They're US marshal, they're holdovers, but they're really county jails. They just keep you with the federal guys. So I'm not mixed in with like, hobos and, you know, people like that. Like, I'm mixed in with\nthe federal people. - So already felt like a prison? - Yeah, I mean, it's a prison. I mean, it's jail, but it's a prison and unless you've been locked up, you don't really know the difference. So it's a jail. Jails\nsuck. Jails are much worse. The whole time I was locked up in these, in the jails waiting to be sentenced, guys were like, \"I just\nwanna get sentenced and go to prison, bro, I just.\" And I was like, \"Why does\neverybody keep saying that?\" Like, prison's worse than this, bro. Like, I saw :Shawshank,\"\nlike, it's horrible. And they're like, \"Bro,\nprison, listen, prison, I can walk the rec yard. I could go to the movie\nroom, watch movies. I'll, listen within, right after count,\" for this four o'clock count, they count everybody at four. So they are like, \"Right after count, I'm gonna go to commissary. Somebody's gonna buy me an ice cream, I'm gonna be eating an ice\ncream, walking on the rec yard the first day,\" like, and I'm,\nyou know, it's been months and months and months,\nand I've been locked up in this county jail and I'm\nthinking, I wanna go to prison. Like that sounds nice. I'd\nlove, I'd like an ice cream. - Yeah, but there was a stabbing\non the first day, sort of. - Yeah, well, you know,\neverybody kept telling me I was gonna go to a camp,\nyou're gonna go to a camp, you're gonna go to a low. - I see.\n- You know, and honestly, I was very quickly, I was\nwalking on the rec yard. I was, you know, so I was\nat the medium, I got there, you know, it's a real\nprison with the doors, bam. And they can open the little tray thing and feed you outta the tray and there's a stainless\nsteel toilet and sink. And you know, they have\nthat in the county too. But, you know, it's exactly what you think of prison as being. - But it feels like a\nfundamentally different experience when it's 26 years and the door locks and- - Yeah. So I, yeah, I have a, a cellie and, but I'm also, as they sent me\nto a prison where guys have, tons of guys have 30, 40, 50 years, you know, life sentences. There's gangsters there,\nthere's murderers, there's serial killers, there's,\nyou know, really bad guys. There's, you know, there's\nguys that are, you know, trying to take advantage of guys, right? - Yeah like sexually or?\n- Yeah. But by the time I got there,\nI'd heard all the, you know how you can get yourself in trouble. You know how you can, like, don't go in somebody else's cell. You don't know the guy,\nyou're not 100% sure, do not go in his cell,\ndon't even go near his cell. Don't go into places where\npeople can close a door behind you or they can\ntrap you in an area. Don't, you know, there's all these things that I've been told not to do. - Again, for sexual reasons?\n- Right? Because I'm a small guy in prison. - Yeah.\n- You know. - Trapped a white dude. - Yeah, it's a problem. It's a problem. This. - Yeah.\n- It's bad, it's all bad. - Well, it's good in the outside world, but bad in-\n- You know. Yeah, my fear was there, make\nme shave my head to make sure that the mop wig fits correctly. - Yeah.\n- But there's certain things that, I always hate to say this,\nbut I mean, and it doesn't, this is the simplest\nway to say it, is that if you get stabbed in\nprison, you had it coming, you did something. Like they're not running\naround just stabbing people. You did something. You, and the things that\nget you hurt is you argue over the TV, what channel you wanna watch. You got 50, 80 guys watching one TV. Don't argue about it. Like it's none of just not worth it. Borrowing things that\nand not returning them, that's a problem. Running up debts, that's a big problem. You know, gambling, gossiping, you know, those are the problems. Those things get you hurt. Not\nbeing polite, be respectful. I'm super respectful. So I was respectful, very quickly when I got to Coleman, there are continuing education courses. One of the courses is\nresidential real estate. The guy that was running\nthe residential real estate didn't wanna do it anymore\nbecause he was doing legal work and it just was taking too much time. So he came to me and said,\n\"Listen, you just got here. You got a real estate background\nlike nobody else does. Can you take over this class?\" And I was like, \"Sure.\" So I looked at his curriculum, I kind of rewrote it a little bit and I started teaching them\nresidential real estate class. And at one point I was\nteaching two classes, like a semester or a quarter. And these guys loved it, bro. Like everybody, they all\nthink they're gonna get out and flip houses. So I started, you know,\nfrom the fundamentals, I talk about credit, how to\nborrow, how hard money lenders, different types of bar, like, everything. And, you know, guys are walking, it's the first time in\nmy life, this was funny. Not that I think I was really in a, ever in a position for this to happen. This was really odd though. Probably the second or third\nclass when guys are leaving and I'm having to check them off the roll, multiple guys are stopping\nand saying, \"Yo bro.\" Putting their hand out and shaking my hand and going, \"Good class,\nit was a good class, bro.\" Then I have guys coming to me telling me, \"Hey, what are you teaching these guys?\" I go, \"What do you mean?\" he goes, \"My cellie's telling me he's gonna get out and make millions. I'm taking Cox's real estate class. I'm telling you I can do this.\nI'm gonna be a millionaire.\" And it's like this flipping houses. Like this is not.\n- Yeah. - But the truth is, if you know it is the, flipping houses was, what I\nbasically told these guys, especially the drug dealers, right? You're a drug dealer and you\nwere raised in the projects, and you're going back to\nthe projects like this is, this is the one industry or you know, that you will thrive at because you're a hustler. You're not afraid, a 45-year-old divorced white woman is not going into\nthe hood knocking on doors to try and flip houses. But you will. And you know, everybody\nin the neighborhood and you'll knock on those\ndoors and you'll hustle and you'll, you've been told no before and you don't care and you're not scared. You're not this. And there's tons of money to\nbe made in lower income areas. And so, and then when I\ngo through the whole thing and how you can leverage, you\nknow, leverage your credit to borrow money to get into the property and rent, do the renovations\nwith very little money down. And I do the whole thing. These guys, like, they loved it. So I was, and what that\ndid for me was two things. One, if you got to the class,\n40 guys show up for the class. And I say, \"Look, if you don't want to go, you don't wanna be here, you just want it 'cause your counselor's\nmaking you get a certificate. You don't wanna be here, that's fine. Bring me two coffees and like\ntwo creamers from commissary and I'll fill out all your\npaperwork and you'll pass. You'll get a certificate. I\ndon't have to see you again.\" I have full of coffee and creamer, 'cause at least 10 or 15\ndidn't wanna be there. The other guys seriously\nwanted to be there. And I don't want those\nguys to be there anyway. They're gonna be a problem. So the other guys are serious about it. And some of these guys sat\nthrough the class 2, 3, 4 times. Some of these guys got\nout and sent me money. So, you know, which is like\na huge sign of respect. You know, by the way, 'cause\nthey don't owe me anything. But I did that and I taught GED because, you know, I, you have\nto do something for money. And, you know, I met some,\nI met a bunch of cool guys and I was hanging out\nand I was doing well. And after about three\nyears, they transferred me to the low security prison. At this point, like the\nFBI starts showing up, asking me questions. They asked me questions about\nthe politician I bribed, you know, asked me questions about him. Statute of limitations was up and they were trying to tie\nhim into the bank fraud, 'cause his name was Kevin White and one of my guys' name\nwas Michael, Kevin White. And so they were trying\nto tie him in, you know? \"Did you, did he know about it? 'Cause if he knew about it, statute of limitations is 10 years. We could,\" \"No, he didn't know.\" Should've thrown him in there. But anyway, 'cause like a couple years later he gets indicted, he\nends up going to jail anyway. - And it could've decreased your sentence. - Yeah. Listen, listen. Stop, stop. - Listen.\n- Oh my God, - I got all my judgment out after the homeless conversation. - [Matt] Listen, it's\nonly gonna get worse. - I mean, I really appreciate your honesty and your insight about, like,\nabout snitching, honestly, that I have a sense that there's at least a desire for\nloyalty in the world. - I, wouldn't that be nice? - Did you ever feel in\ndanger in medium or low? - It's funny. I had more problems at the, probably at the low than I did the medium. But at the medium, the only\nthing that happened was, an article came out in the newspaper when I was at the meeting,\nit came out and said, 'cause they're, you know, they're still investigating things. So this article comes out and I'm on the front page of\nthe \"St. Petersburg Times.\" It was about the politician, big article. And in the article it says, they interviewed Millie, my lawyer. And she says, \"Well, when\nMr. Cox was being interviewed by the FBI, one of the\nfirst things they wanted to know about was this politician.\" So she just said, \"Mr.\nCox was being interviewed by the FBI.\" So I immediately get taken into custody and they put me in the\nSHU, in the hole, right? For my own protection. And\nI'm there for like 45 days. And then after 45 days, they're like, \"Cox, what do you want us to do? You want us to ship you?\" I was like, \"No, put me\nback on the compound.\" I'm like, \"Half the guys here cooperated.\" And he goes, \"Yeah, it's more than half.\" He said, \"But this is the guy from SIS,\" which is like their internal security. - So that's when he told you, that it's actually much higher percentage. - Right, but he goes, but 90 per, he said, \"But 100% of them are lying about it.\" He said, \"You just came\nout in the newspaper.\" I go, \"Man, I'm not concerned.\" If he's, \"You are concerned, you gotta come immediately\nto the lieutenant's office and tell us, we'll ship you.\" I said, \"Okay.\" I get out there, people\nare giving me like the, looking at me and, \"What's up,\" you know, but I don't have a lot of friends anyway. And I didn't come there to make friends. And so at one point,\nthis one guy comes to me, I'm walking the yard\nprobably two days later after I get on back on\nthe compound, I'm walking. The guy comes to me, he has a goatee and he's got a, it comes down here and he is got a skull,\nlike a little skull thing he had made whittled\noutta wood or something. And, you know, definitely looked scary. But, so I'm walking and he stopped and he goes, \"Hey Cox,\" I've never talked to these guys. I had been there for a year or so and never talked to any of these guys. They're all like bikers and\nyou know, Arian brotherhood. And so, you know, I'm\nlike, \"Yeah, what's up?\" He said, \"Bubba,\" Bubba's their leader. He goes, he goes, \"Bubba told me to tell you not to walk the yard. He don't wanna see you out in the yard.\" And I went, \"Okay.\" I said, \"Well, I'm gonna\nwalk the yard tonight.\" I said, \"And if I get\nthe shit kicked outta me, then I get the shit kicked outta me.\" - But did you talk back to a guy with a wooden skull hanging off his beard? - I did, but you know what, it was right in front of the guard shack. And so there's guards in\nthe guard shack, you know, like, they're 20 feet away.\n- Really? You weren't scared? - I mean, I think I just got numb. Like I'm not stupid, but\nI'm all, I'm walking around. I'm, you know, I was scared\nfrom the moment I got there on, if that makes sense. So you get to a point\nwhere you're just numb and you're waiting for it. Especially when I got outta\nthe SHU, got outta the SHU, I went straight to my cell, laid down. Couple minutes later it was locked down. They closed the doors, I\nwake up the next morning, I go to chow, I go to my job,\nlike it starts all over again. So I was, I had a very packed routine, so I didn't spend, although\nthere's guys everywhere and I'm thinking at some point I might just be walking around. A guy might walk up and\njust smash me in the head. But it didn't happen. And it's not, the guys\naren't getting stabbed, but they've got it coming. I didn't tell on anybody\nhere. I didn't do anything. It's not that on other yards I might not have gotten smashed,\nbut I didn't get smashed. And I'd been there a while and I taught the real estate class, and everybody wanted to take real estate. So I think that insulated me to a degree. I also had made a few friends there, and I think they were probably also kind of putting out the words like,\n\"Bro, cut this guy a break.\" So I'm walking across and I tell the guy, I said, \"Look man,\" I said, you know, and\nI wasn't rude to him. He wasn't even rude to me, really. He said, \"Don't walk the yard anymore, Bubba doesn't want you\nto walk in the yard.\" I said, \"Well, listen, I'm gonna go to chow and then\nI'm gonna go out there tonight and walk the yard, and if I\nget smashed, I get smashed.\" I go, \"Because I got 26 years and I cannot walk around\nfor the next 26 years, not going on the yard.\" I said, \"So I'm gonna be there and if that happens, then that happens.\" And he looked at me and he goes, \"Man, I don't give a fuck what you do.\" He's, \"That's what Bubba\ntold me to tell you.\" He said, \"I told you.\" And he goes, \"I don't\ngive a shit what you do.\" And he walked off. I went out there that night with a buddy of mine named Zach, a\nguy named John Gordon, with my cousin and a\ncouple of his buddies. We walked the track for about an hour. Bubba and a group of his guys\nstood there and looked at us. And as we walked, probably\nclosest we got to them was 30 or 40 feet, that\nwent on for 30 minutes. And then they kind of broke up\nand went their separate ways. And you know, there was a\ncouple of times where I would go to the chow hall and I would go and I'd be sitting at a\ntable and Bubba would walk up and tell the other guys at the table, \"I wanna let you guys know you're,\" he didn't even call me a snitch. He said, \"You're sitting\nwith a cooperating witness.\" He said, \"That's how you wanna roll.\" He said, \"You ain't gonna be rolling with us if there's any trouble.\" And then they all kind of looked at me and they got their plate\nand they moved off. He didn't tell me to move. And he could've walked up and said, \"This is a snitch, motherfucker.\" He didn't do that. Bubba\nwas very respectful. So as respectful as you could be in that situation.\n- Whatever you wanna say about Bubba, he was a respectful man. You ever talked to him directly? - Never had a conversation with him. So that went on. But I mean, not, when I say\nthat went on, I mean like, literally, like that's a couple of times. He said the same thing to\na guy in line one time. Guy came up to me later and said, \"Look, man, but I'm sorry, Matt. He was standing next to me in line. Bubba said something to him. He went like 10 or 15 people back and stood in line. Later on he came up to me, \"Matt, I'm sorry bro,\nbut you know, Bubba.\" But I said, \"Bro,\" I\nsaid, \"Look, I get it. We're not friends, don't worry about it.\" And here's the thing, at\nsome point there, I got, I ended up getting, well, the FBI started showing\nup there at the prison questioning me about my files in Tampa, the one of the 12 guys that were indicted, they show up and they\nstart asking me about it. And so they're still kinda working it. Well, at the same time,\nI end up getting moved to the low security prison. I get the low security prison. They show up over and over again. But at some point they come to me and they say, \"Look, we\nwent to the US Attorney, we presented everything we have. I have enough for an investor. I have enough for to\nindict all of these guys.\" I think it was whittled down\nto maybe eight instead of 12. And they said, \"Look, the entire economy's melting down.\" At this point, these are, some of these are four or five years old. We don't, we've got banks that\nare melting down right now. We got a hundred, 200, 300 million, 500, half a billion dollar banks\nthat we're investigating. We don't have time to deal with this. We're not gonna in, we're not\ngoing to indict those people. So they get away. The agent I was working with, her name was Leslie\nNelson, very nice person. She came, actually didn't have to do this, came to the prison to tell\nme this is what happened. And when she'd first come\nto see me, I told her, \"Listen, I wanna do all this, but no matter what happens, I need you to write me a letter. If they don't, and if they\ndon't indict these people, I need you to write me a\nletter that I can present to the US Attorney on my behalf that I did everything I could.\" And she goes, \"I'll do that,\nbut that's not gonna happen. We're gonna get the indictments,\neverything,\" I was, \"Okay.\" So of course a year later she\nshows up after nothing happens and they dropped the case, she shows up and she tells me what happened\nand he's not gonna do it. And I was, I go, \"Do you\nremember that you,\" she goes, I got the letter right\nnow,\" gave me the letter. She goes like, \"That's it.\" Great letter. You know, it says, you know, \"Mr. Cox has worked,\" you\nknow, blah, blah, blah. \"He's done this,\" this is great. And even said, you know, \"He deserves a reduction in\nmy opinion,\" blah, blah, blah. So, but there's no, there's\nnobody, nobody was arrested. So I call my public defender, I called Millie, I explain it to her. And you know, she starts, you know, she starts crying and she's sorry. And, \"Well, what are we gonna do?\" Well, there's nothing you can do. You're time barred. Like you have one year to file a 2255, which is to say that your\nlawyer is ineffective, or that the court has made\na mistake in some way. And it had been over a year, and it had been years,\nit'd been like four years. And she's like, \"Yeah,\nI mean, you're just, there's nothing you can do.\" And she's in tears. And I kind of feel like I'm done. At that point I'm done. And what I do is I start\nwriting a book, right? I write a memoir, my memoir. And this is not a shameless\nplug for my memoir, by the way, which is amazing, just saying. But so what happens is, I actually write it, you know, I write it and then I have to rewrite it, right? 'Cause I don't really know\nwhat I'm doing, you know, and I've been reading true\ncrime and that sort of thing, and I've always liked true crime. I get a literary agent, comes to see me, tells me I have to rewrite some stuff. We rewrite it. As I'm finishing up my\nmemoir, there's a guy that comes on the compound, and\nhis name is Efraim Diveroli. Efraim Diveroli and his business partner, a guy named Packouz, were selling munitions, AK-47 rounds. Really tons of munitions. But they got in trouble with this, and they were selling\nthem to the US government for the Afghani Security Forces. And there had been an article in \"Rolling Stone Magazine\" about him. And I'd read it and\nsomebody points him out and says, \"Hey, that's that guy that's,\" and I went up to him, I said,\n\"Hey, bro, you just got here?\" He is like, \"Yeah.\" And I said, \"Look, if\nyou wanna write a memoir or anything, I'm finishing my memoir. I can always help you. I can help you write an outline. You can get a professional writer, whatever is you need help,\"\nhe's like, \"Yeah, all right.\" Efraim Diveroli was played by Jonah Hill in the movie, \"War Dogs.\" So a few months later, he comes to me and says, you know, \"Hey,\nthey sold the movie rights.\" I was like, \"Oh wow, that's great.\" And I'm like, \"And you\ndon't wanna write a memoir?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, man, it was sold to the guys from the \"Hangover\" movie. And I was like, \"So the guys from the \"Hangover\" movie are going to make a movie about you.\" I said, \"You understand,\nthey're gonna call it like, 'Dude, Where's My Hand Grenade?' And you're gonna be Spicoli from \"Fast Times At Ridgemont High. Like, you're gonna be a joke, all because you don't wanna write a memoir and get your version out there.\" And he was like, \"Holy shit.\" So I end up writing an outline for him. We worked together, and then he asked that,\n\"Can I read your book?\" And I was like, \"Sure,\" and I\ngive it to him and he reads it and he comes back and\nhe said, \"Bro,\" he says, \"This is the best thing\nI've ever read in my life.\" And to be honest, I\nlater found out he'd read about three books in his entire life. But still, it was very, it was very nice. - Still to bring out the other two. - So he asked me if I'll write\nhis book, I write his book. We work out a deal. And we do that 'cause, and I'm saying all this because I basically settle in. I'm done, I'm gonna do 26 years. - By the way, just in a\nsmall tangent, how did you, how did you know you'd be good at writing? - I'd kind of written a manuscript prior to even taking off on the run. I used to listen to John\nGrisham books, you know, I'd listen to him in the car. Like I like John Grisham books. And I'd actually written a manuscript about a mortgage broker. You know, he writes about\nlawyers and it's like, lawyer, being a lawyer is not exciting. If you can make that sound exciting I can make being a mortgage broker. And I wrote a book, you\nknow, put it at my desk and you know, the FBI found it. And they had, you know,\nsaid, \"Oh, it's a blueprint to the fraud that he's going to commit.\" It wasn't, stop, it's as much, that character was as much me as John Grisham's characters are him. - But it's still kind of interesting that- - It is\n- Because John Grisham didn't. - Right, I mean, you know,\nif John Grisham did something similar to what one of the, you know.\n- Yeah, I saw a quote somewhere that the\ncriminal is a true artist and the detective is merely a critic. Something like that. Does that resonate with you or not? - I'll have to look that up.\n- Okay. So you already knew you could write? - Well, I knew I liked it,\nbut yeah, I think I got better and better at it. I mean, you know, as you're writing and they had creative\nwriting classes, you know, in prison at the low, you know, the low was a much\ndifferent breed of animal, you know, like it, you know, it was, you could very easily get hurt. You could get hurt either place. But there were guys\nthat have life sentences that had been working out for 20 years and were just super angry,\nyou know, at the medium. And if you got hurt at the medium, it was probably really go bad, as opposed to you get hurt at the low, it's more like a fist\nfight in high school. So with knives. So anyway, so I'm there,\nI'm writing, I'm doing that. And there was a guy on the compound that came on the compound\nabout that same time. His name was Frank Amodeo. Frank Amodeo is a rapid cycling bipolar with features of schizophrenia - Rapid cycling, bipolar with\nfeatures of schizophrenia. - Schizophrenia,\n- Rapid cycling. - So it's just constant, right? And so there are moments\nin his manic state where his reoccurring psychosis, I guess is that he believes, and since he was in his\nearly teens, has believed that he is preordained by God\nto be emperor of the world. He's a lawyer. Disbarred, stole close to $200 million from the federal government. They gave him 22 years and\nthey sent him to Coleman. But it doesn't, this is the part I love. The delusions don't affect his legal work. It doesn't say a ton for legal community. But-\n- How do you know he's delusional? I'm just asking questions. - Yeah, he's, trust me,\nI mean, it's not me. It's like the transcripts, the lawyers, the doctors, you know. Yeah, there's a ton of, a ton.\n- All right. - And then if you saw him in action, you'd be like, \"Oh, wow.\" You know, he would be completely normal. He would be having a\ncompletely normal conversation, and somebody would say something and he would, he'd go,\n\"That makes me so angry. I can't, I'm not gonna let them do that. When my legions march on Washington, we are going to burn the constitution, and the president will kneel at my feet\" And he goes, \"I'm gonna need your transcripts. I'm gonna need a 2255 form. We're gonna file a,\" you\nknow, and it would just like, and everybody would sit there\nand be like, \"Okay, Frank, I'll get to this and\nI'll get,\" it was insane. It was the most insane. He was basically running\na medium-sized law firm from inside of the prison. He was training people. He taught the legal research class and was training people on\nhow to do legal research in prison, how to put together motions, how to fight, fight their\ncases, how to do the research, how to type them up, everything. He's teaching a law. It is just like a law school, right? Like he's teaching these guys, he, listen, they made such a mistake\nlocking this guy up. - So he is a great lawyer. - Listen, it's gonna get worse. It's gonna get worse. Because here's what\nhappens is at this point, I don't talk to him for\nprobably a year or so because everybody's saying\nhe's crazy, you know? And he's, and then for\nlike a year he gets there, he's drooling out of\nthe side of his mouth. They got him on a ton of medication. It takes him about a year to get them, to take him off the medication. So he gets them to take\nthem off the medication and then he starts kind\nof stabilizing his mood by drinking Pepsi. I know, bro, it's crazy,\nI know it's crazy. I know how, I see you looking at me like this guy's delusion. I know, but.\n- It works, whatever works. - So at some point, one\nof my buddies comes to me and says, \"Look, you\ngotta go talk to Frank.\" Well, here's the other thing. Over the course of a year or two that he starts doing legal work for guys, he starts just taking on guys' cases. \"I'll do the motion, I'll do\nyour legal work, I'll do this.\" Keeps him busy, but suddenly you start\nhearing people get released. You know, Jimmy just got 10\nyears knocked off his sentence. He's going to halfway house next month. You know, Tom got an immediate release. Frank's walking people up to\nR and D, shaking their hands. Guys are walking up to\nhim in tears, crying. And so, you know, crazy or not, what choice do I have? I called three different\nlawyers on the street and said, \"This is what\nhappened, what can I do? What can I do? They had me, they told me to\ndo this and this and this, and I worked with them, and then they decided not to proceed. And what can I do?\" And they said, \"You're hit, bro. There's nothing you can do. You cannot, in the middle,\nin the 11th circuit, you cannot force them to file\na reduction on your behalf. You cannot do it. It's impossible. You're hit, you're done. It's over. I'd love to take your money, Mr. Cox, but it's not gonna happen. I don't, I can't, I'm not\njust gonna take your money. You're gonna lose.\" Three different lawyers. I talked to, I or T.I.'s lawyer. Told me, \"Well, it's not\ngonna happen, it's over.\" So my buddy says, \"Go talk to Frank.\" I said, \"Well, why wouldn't I? I got nothing else to lose.\" So I go talk to Frank. He actually has a little manic moment, that little thing that I just showed you. That's exactly what he said\nthe first time I talked to him. - Based on your case.\n- Yes. \"I won't let this happen.\" He's like, \"I'm gonna\nneed your transcripts. I'm gonna need you to get this. I need to see your indictment. I'm gonna need your pre-sentence report. I'm gonna need.\" It's like, \"Okay.\" And\nI turned to my buddy. He's like, \"Bro, I know, I\nknow what you're thinking. It's fine.\" \"Fucking crazy.\" And he's like, he's like, \"I understand. Let just, what choice do you have?\" I was like, \"Fuck.\" So Frank files a 2255 motion on my behalf, stating that I'm not time barred that Millie was, we file it against Millie stating that she was ineffective, right? That she didn't understand the law. She had me plead to something, 'cause she thought I could get a reduction simply for doing \"Dateline.\" Oh, by the way, when I was in the medium, the government came to me and asked me to be interviewed by \"American Greed.\" I do that, I'm interviewed, you know, they get me on the phone. They talk to me, everything. The prosecutor wants me to\ndo it. She's re-interviewed. Everybody's re-interviewed. It airs, Millie goes to them, to the government, says,\n\"Look, reduce the sentence.\" They go, \"No, Millie, it's not enough.\" Then they come to me and they ask me to write an ethics and fraud course. I write an ethics and fraud course. The guy I write the\ncourse with, he flies up to Atlanta, he talks\nwith, I think he drove up, but he goes up to Atlanta, he talks with a US\nAttorney, talks to Millie. She insists, \"If he does this,\nI will reduce his sentence. I will definitely consider this.\" Definitely consider.\n- Yeah, definitely consider. - And then we do it. It's being used all over the nation. Not enough.\n- Considered, yeah. - So that's where, at\nthis point, I go to Frank. I tell Frank what's happening. Frank says, \"Yeah, this is,\" he goes, \"Every time they asked\nyou to do something, it reset the time bar. You have a year from that\ntime to file a 2255.\" Now, he insists that that\nwas a viable argument. Nobody else does. But he said, \"I'm not\ngonna let them do this. I'm gonna take care of this. I'm gonna get your sentence reduced.\" Okay, emperor. Okay, emperor.\n(Lex laughs) So he was a character. Anyway, so he files a 2255. The government comes back,\nthey say, \"He's time barred.\" Frank comes back, he you\nknow, they answer his motion. He files a retort. They file, you know, it\njust goes back and forth. This goes on for six months to a year. And at some point I go to mail call, and, you know, they call my name and they hand me this\nthing and I open it up and it says, \"The government's\nfiled a motion for a stay\" so that they can, they want the court to appoint me a lawyer and to discuss filing a rule 35, reducing my sentence. And, you know, I'm like, I read it, but I couldn't even understand. Like, well, I don't understand. So, I mean, I rushed to go find Frank. I show it to Frank and he says, \"Yeah, they're staying it,\nthey're gonna send you a lawyer and you're gonna negotiate for how much they're gonna\nreduce your sentence.\" He said, \"It's perfect.\" So they fly this woman down,\nher name was Esther Panitch. She flies down, comes\nto the visitation room, they bring me there, the lawyer's room, whatever they call it, and\nso we're sitting there, and I remember we're talking and she says, \"Listen, your, your motion, you're 2255, it's written well, but honestly, you don't\nhave much of a prayer. And they're offering you\na one level reduction, which is 30 months.\" And I went, \"Oh, that's,\nthat's not enough.\" And she said, \"Well, I don't\nknow what to tell you.\" She said, \"They're willing\nto bring you back.\" And I was like, \"Well, you know, I mean, I don't know,\nI gotta talk to Frank. Frank said I deserve this many levels.\" And, you know, we're going back and forth. She says, \"Who's Frank?\" And I go, \"Frank's the guy\nthat's doing all my legal work.\" She goes, \"He didn't write all this? And I was like, \"No.\"\nShe goes, \"Who wrote?\" And I explained it to her and she's like, \"He's an inmate?\" And I was like, \"Yeah.\" And she's, \"Why is he here?\" And I tell her, \"Well, 'cause\nshe stole a bunch of money from the federal government, 'cause he's trying to\ntake over the world.\" So I tell her that whole thing. And she's like, \"You're\nletting a mentally incompetent, you know, person, do your legal work.\" And I was like, \"Yeah, because all the competent attorneys wouldn't do it.\" They said I didn't have a prayer. Your people said, I didn't have a prayer. And I said, \"Frank said he was gonna, he could get this done.\" And she's like, \"Well, I mean,\nyou know, you don't like, I don't even know why they're\noffering you one level.\" I was like, \"Well, Frank said,\" you know, and I'm like, \"Frank this, Frank that.\" And so she and I end\nup saying, she's like, \"You're taking advice from a\nlegally incompetent person.\" I said, \"Yeah.\" And she said, \"You know, you\nreally don't have a prayer.\" I said, \"Then why are you here?\" I said, \"If they could crush me so easily, why are you here?\" I said, \"They're giving me one level. Lemme talk to Frank, I'll let\nyou know what we're gonna do.\" So I leave, I call her\na couple days later. I tell her, Frank and I talked to Frank. Frank said, \"Go back, go\nback and argue for more.\" He said, \"I think the judge\nis gonna give you more. He's gonna give you at least, you know, between whatever he said,\" like six or seven levels or something. So I get moved all the\nway back to Atlanta. The FBI agent comes to talk on my behalf. The guy that, like multiple people show up to talk on my behalf. They say, you know, Millie, who I filed the 2255 against. So I'm basically saying,\n\"You're ineffective, you're incompetent,\" you\nknow, but she knows the game. She's like, \"I get it.\" She gets on the stand\nand testifies for me. So the judge goes, \"Eh, you know, listen,\" I think we were asking\nfor like nine levels or something outrageous. Prosecutor starts arguing for one level. And he said, \"Listen, one\nlevel is not nearly enough for what Mr. Cox has done.\" He said, \"Mr. Cox, I know you're arguing for nine levels off your sentence.\" He goes, \"That was never gonna happen.\" I was like, it felt like I got slapped. And he said, \"So I'm\ngonna go with six levels.\" No, no, I'm sorry. He said, three levels. \"I'm gonna go with three levels.\" He goes, \"Which is seven years.\" Which he said, \"For somebody\nwho has no arrest associated with his case, he said,\nI think it's pretty good. And that's my,\" that's his judgment and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he hammered, put the, puts\nthe gavel down and walks off. And that's it. It's over,\nI guess seven years. And I was hoping for more. So\nI get moved back to Coleman. I get moved back to Coleman\nand I go to up to Frank, and I said, Frank, I got seven years off. And he is like, \"I know, I know.\" I said, \"And I don't mean\nto sound unappreciative. I said, I just,\" I said,\n\"I was hoping for more.\" He goes, \"I was too.\" He said, \"It looks like we're gonna have to eat this elephant\none spoonful at a time.\" And he goes, \"Something will come out, something's gonna happen.\" He said, \"Keep your ears\nopen. Something will happen.\" And I said, \"Okay.\" And you know, I honestly, by that point, I'd done, you know, I'd done eight years and I remember like if I got a\nyear off for the drug program and good time and this,\nand I had about eight or eight years left to go or\nsomething, nine years left. And I was like, you know, I can do that. I'll write, you know, I'd been writing. By that point, I'd\nactually written a story. Like I got a book deal\nfor Diveroli, you know, and I ended up writing a synopsis of a guy's story. And I got him in \"Rolling Stone Magazine.\" And I got a book deal for that. Like, I got an advance,\nit was like 3,500 bucks for being in prison, a prisoner\nto get a 3,500 advance. Like I'm a millionaire.\nIt's a lot of money. So, and then we optioned the film rights. Basically the synopsis that\nI wrote for this reporter, journalist for \"Rolling Stone.\" He goes to \"Rolling\nStone\" with what I wrote and gives it to them and they okay it, they say, \"Yeah, this is great. We want you to write an\narticle based on this.\" Okay, he writes the article, he tells me that the article will be from him. His name, Guy Lawson. Douglas Dodd, which is the name of the kid I wrote the memoir about, and Matthew Cox. A couple of weeks before it's going, the article is going to be published, he tells me \"Rolling\nStone\" doesn't want my name on the article because\nI'm in federal prison and doesn't look good, but don't worry, he's gonna\nput my name in the article. And that's just as good. And\nI argue it's not just as good. It's not, I'm like, \"I would be a writer for 'Rolling Stone Magazine.' Like you understand, I'm trying\nto, I'm trying to come up with something here that\nI can rebuild my life as a true crime writer. That's no good.\" What the, and that wasn't so bad. That wasn't the worst of,\nthe worst of it was 90% of the article that he published was taken directly from what I sent him. Like, I mean, sick to my\nstomach, bro, just sick over it. So, but they option, they\noption the life rights for that. And I got a piece of that.\nSo there's like $7,000. I get a check for that. So I'm thrilled, I can keep writing. 'Cause you have to understand\nwriting on the computer there, they charge you. So I start write, oh, they\ncharge you for phone calls, writing, comma, every\nsingle thing costs money. So I start writing all\nthese guy's stories. I start writing books. I just come back from,\nwent back to Atlanta, got seven years knocked\noff my sentence, come back and I'm walking around the compound. Now, there was a guy that\nwas there named Ron Wilson. Ron Wilson ran in the, if\nyou look in the newspaper, it says it's like a hundred\nmillion dollar Ponzi scheme, but really it was $57 million. So he had lost 57 million. So it says a hundred, you know, they, you know, they always exaggerate. 'Cause 57's not enough. Ron ended up getting 19 and a half years. Ron was an old con man, early 60s, 62, 61, I don't know. And Ron, and I liked Ron. So we're walking around the compound and he's like, \"So what are you gonna do? I mean you got like eight\nor nine more years to go.\" And I was like, \"Eh, you\nknow, I'm gonna keep writing and when I get outta here,\nmaybe I'll have a huge body of work and maybe I'll be able to sell it. Or maybe I'll be able to\noption some more stuff. And if I could get together\nwith 'Rolling Stone' or get with some of these\nmagazines, I could start writing for them and I could option those. Maybe I could walk outta\nhere with something.\" So, \"Right, right, right.\" So Ron was, who'd only\nbeen locked up like a year or so, he was cooperating with the Secret Service in his case, against some of his co-defendants. So he's already been debriefed and he's cooperating, he's\nactually thinking he might get brought back to have\nto testify at a trial. We're talking and we're walking and he keeps saying, you know,\n\"Even if I, even if they, they charge those guys,\nand even if this happens, they're not gonna reduce my sentence. They're not gonna cut my sentence.\" And you know, first of all, well probably because you stole a bunch\nof money from pension funds and churches, that didn't help your case. But I don't say that. So I say, oh, they have to, bro, they'll have to, they've, you know, if you cooperate, they're gonna have to, and if they don't, we'll\nhave Frank file a 2255.\" And he's like, \"Ah, that crazy mother.\" So he says, \"Okay.\" He's like, \"Yeah, yeah,\nyou don't understand. You don't understand.\" So this goes on for months. And I'm like, \"What is the problem?\" And he says, \"You know, they think I hid Ponzi scheme money,\" you know, and he'd actually dug up like five or $6 million in Ponzi\nscheme proceeds that he dug. He'd buried in these-\n- Oh, literally. - Literally buried in\naluminum ammunition canisters. Super interesting guy. So he actually went and dug\nthem up and gave them to him. And I'm like, \"Well, you\ngave them all the money. It's, you didn't hide anything. Relax, it's not a big deal. They're not gonna find anything,\nso don't worry about it.\" And so he mentions it\na couple weeks later, a couple weeks later,\nand then one day I go, \"Bro, why do you keep bringing this up? Like, what are you concerned about? They're, it's not gonna happen.\" And he said, \"Can I trust you?\" And I went, \"Probably not.\" And he goes,\n(Matt laughs) \"I did hide some money.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" I said, \"You know, you\nbury it in a can somewhere? And he's like, \"No.\" He said, \"I gave my wife\nlike 150,000 in cash.\" I said, \"Okay, well she's\nnot gonna say anything she's using it.\" He said, \"No, you don't understand. Since then she found out\nI was having an affair and we're gonna get a\ndivorce and she hates me. And I think she'll turn that money in just to make sure that I\ndon't get a reduction.\" 'Cause if you lie to the\nFBI, they're not gonna, it doesn't matter what\nyou've done for them, they won't give you anything. And so he's, I'm sorry,\nit's Secret Service or anybody, he has clearly\nlied to the Secret Service at this point. If she goes and says,\n\"This is what he gave me.\" So he's like, I was like, \"Oh, wow.\" And he's like, \"And I gave\nmy, my brother's holding maybe 30,000 for me.\" And at that moment I was like,\nwow, like this poor guy. No, that's not what I thought at all. What I thought was, is that enough to get me a sentence reduction? - You son of a bitch.\n(Matt laughs) - And I went and I sat there and you know what I\nthought, I thought, I did, I thought, no, I thought,\nthat's not enough. That's not enough. It's nothing.\nThat's not even $200,000. Like, and they didn't want\nto give me a reduction. My prosecutor was pissed\nthat I got seven years off. She wanted me to get 30 months. She's not gonna give me\nanything. It's up to her. She's not gonna do it. So I go, I lay down, I go to bed. Like a month later I'm on\nthe phone with my lawyer, 'cause I had written,\nremember I wrote a man, I had a manuscript from my book, and I wanted to put some of\nthe stuff that was said at my, in my sentencing in the book. So I was trying to get my lawyer to mail me my transcripts\nand she hadn't done it. So I called her and I said,\n\"Listen, you said you're gonna,\" she's like, \"Oh God man, I'm so sorry. I'm so busy. I'll do it, I'll do it.\" And then she went, this is Esther. She goes, \"So what else\nis going on in there?\" And this, she never wanted to talk to me. Like she didn't, you know, when they were paying her,\nshe didn't want to talk to me. And I was like, \"What\ndo you mean? Nothing. I just need my transcripts and she's like, \"Nothing's happening? There's nothing you wanna talk about?\" And I was like, and I went,\n\"You know what? You know what? There's something weird\nhappened. Listen to this.\" And I told her about Ron Wilson. And she goes, \"Hold on. (Matt imitates typing) And she looks him up on the computer. She goes, \"Oh wow. This is a\nbad guy. This is a bad guy. And he told you, and you know where to?\" I said, \"Absolutely, and\nI can tell you exactly.\" And she goes, \"Okay, okay, okay.\" She goes, \"Let me look\ninto this.\" I go, \"Okay.\" So, a week later, a CO comes\nto me and goes, \"Hey Cox.\" And I go, \"What's up?\" He goes, \"Listen, at the next move,\" 'cause you know, they\nhave controlled moves. All the doors are locked and they open them up for 10 minutes. So you can run to the chow hall or you can run to the,\nyou can't run though. No running on the compound. But you can walk fast.\n- Move quickly, yeah. - Yes, to the rec yard\nor the library, whatever. He says, \"At the next move go to SIS.\" You know, so I go to SIS on the next move. But I was used to going there, by the way, because I was constantly ordering Freedom of Information Acts. And they would, so I'd\norder your, you're an inmate and I'd order, I'm\nwriting a story for you. And I'd order it and they'd send it to me. And then they would catch\nit and they'd be like, \"Why are you getting Lex's information?\" So they'd call me down there\nand I go, \"No, I ordered it for him and I'm writing a story. And I'd already been in\n\"Rolling Stone\" and everything. They're like, \"What's the story?\" And I tell them the story, they go, \"It's a pretty good story, here.\" And so I go down there,\nbut this is different. This, the guy answers the door and his guy, they call him Bulldog and he was a real asshole. He was a lieutenant at SIS and he's like, \"Come in here,\nget in here, Cox, sit down.\" And he dials the phone and he goes, \"Here, you\ngotta talk to this guy.\" And I'm like, \"What?\" And I pick up the phone,\nI'm like, \"Hello?\" And the guy goes, \"Hey,\nthis is Agent Griffin with the Secret Service. I understand, you know,\nwhere Ron Wilson is, has hidden Ponzi scheme money.\" I went, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I want something in writing. I want, you know, so I start\ndoing that and they go, \"Okay.\" Then I get his email address and we start emailing\neach other back and forth. And he ends up getting a\nletter from the US Attorney in South Carolina that says they will consider it\nsubstantial assistance if they make arrests or recover a substantial amount of money. That's the best I'm gonna get is consider. So I start talking to this guy and he starts asking me\nquestions about Ron Wilson. Like, \"Hey, ask him this, ask him this.\" So I'm like, \"Bro, I\ngotta kind of work that into a conversation, that's\nan odd thing to ask.\" So this goes on for six months. So I'm asking questions and\nI'm typing up little reports and I'm a prison snitch now. So I'm not just like cooperating, I'm now, I'm a prison snitch. So I've moved down, I've moved down actually from being just a cooperating witness or- - Because you're in prison? Is that what makes you a prison snitch? - Prison snitch. You can't even really say, no, you could say prison rat. You could say prison rat. I think prison snitch. I think that's probably\nthe closer to the term that most guys would use. - What's the difference between a snitch and a rat in prison? - I'm not sure. It rolls\noff the tongue better. Prison rat doesn't sound\nas good as prison snitch. I don't know, I don't spend a lot of\ntime thinking about this. So what happens is, I'm asking Wilson questions periodically, and at some point they contact me and they say, \"Listen, Wilson's\nabout to get some bad news.\" And I go, \"Okay.\" And they go, \"He's, you know, like, I wouldn't wanna tell you what it is. Let us know what happens.\" It's like two days go by and one day Wilson comes up to me one day and says, \"Cox, Cox.\" And I'm like, \"Oh shit.\" I'm like, \"Hey, what's up?\" You know? And he is like, \"Oh, you're\nnot gonna believe this. I got indicted.\" I was like, \"What? What happened?\" No!\" \"Yeah, my wife, they questioned my wife and my brother and my\nbrother, my wife walked in. First she said, 'I don't have nothing. I don't know what you're talking about.'\" The next day the brother\nwalks in and gives them $150,000 in cash. And so the next day the wife comes back and gives him $250,000 in cash and a bunch of silver, like gold bullion and silver, you know? 'Cause his Ponzi scheme\nwas based off of silver. You know, he was gonna\ninvest in silver for you. So half a million dollars,\nthey turn over half a million. I'm like, \"Half a million dollars? I thought you said it was\nlike 100,000 or something.\" And he's like, \"I know, I\ndidn't know I could trust you.\" I'm like, \"Ron, what are you doing? I thought we were.\" So, I'll tell you something just for the icing on\nthe cake, by the way. The icing on the cake. Lemme\nexplain one more thing. - Yep.\n- There's, so if you're gonna, if somebody cooperates with\nthe federal government, let's say I get arrested and they go, \"You want to help yourself?\" And you go, \"Yeah, okay, look, Jimmy is a, he lives next to me and\nhe's running a meth house,\" you know, a meth lab, whatever. And they go and they raid\nJimmy and he gets arrested. You're gonna get something off of that. Not a lot, but you're gonna get something. Now, and they could just say, \"We were gonna bust him anyway. We were already onto him,\" right? Now, the next level\nwould be you wear a wire. So I wore a wire and I was in danger. Now keep in mind, I'm\nasking this guy questions inside federal prison, I'm in danger. So whatever, that's like the next level. You're active, you're taking\nan active participation in the investigation. And the third level would be\nyou actually get on the stand and you cooperate and you testify. There's no better cooperation than that. So when Wilson says to me, \"They're gonna move me\nback to South Carolina, they've indicted me, they charged me, what do you think I should do?\" And I go, \"I think you\nshould go to trial,\" because I know they'll have\nto call me as a witness. Just to let you know, 'cause I don't, I don't want you to, I don't wanna walk outta here and have you feeling, feeling\nlike, hey, there's some, there's some good to this guy. - No.\n- So I'm ready, I'm ready to cut Wilson like a fish. - So.\n- Yeah. But you are putting yourself in danger if you get on the stand, right? - I'm already in danger. If people there heard what I was doing, I probably would've been in danger. - Does that increase the\nchance of them hearing or no? if you go to court.\n- It does, but it also increases my ability to get more off my sentence. So what happens is, a couple days later, he's on what's called the Packout, right? They're gonna move him maybe a week later. So they come and get him, they\nmove him, he gets back there to South Carolina and he pleads guilty. They sentence him, he\ngets six months added on. So he is now on from 19\nand a half to 20 years. And by the way, when COVID\nhit, he was released. So he only ended up doing like six years on a 20 year sentence\nbecause he was older. He's, by that point,\nhe's 66, 67 years old. You know, he's an old, anybody older than 55 was endangered, especially in the prison. So they had a COVID thing where they were releasing these guys and sending them home on ankle monitors. Like he's an old man, he's not,\nhe you, he's not gonna hurt. He's not a danger. So they sent him home. So he ended up doing, so he didn't even serve the six months. He didn't even serve the\noriginal sentence, whatever. Not that I care. So I'm just saying it makes\nyou feel like poor Ron, it's okay, so his wife got\nlike a hundred year a hundred. She got like a hundred\nhours of community service or something, or 60 hours. And I think his brother\ngot six months papers. So they got charged with\nobstruction of justice, you know, and they didn't,\nneither one of them, you know, just like six months probation and community service, nothing. So when we, I turn around,\nI'm waiting for my reduction, waiting, waiting. After about 90 days after this guy gets\nsentenced, maybe six months, I send a letter, \"Hey, what's going on?\" to the prosecutor, to my prosecutor, their the prosecutor, both\ndistricts, no response. Then I go to Frank, I explain to Frank and Frank has known what's\ngoing on the whole time. And Frank goes, \"Okay,\nI'm gonna file a 2255.\" So we file a 2255, government comes back and they, first thing\nthey say is, \"Your Honor, we don't know about any cooperation. We've never heard about any cooperation.\" So of course then we submit\nthe letter that we have. The judge comes back and the the judge ends up saying, \"It's a little complicated,\" but he ends up saying, \"Look,\nI don't have jurisdiction to hear this because\nyou may be time barred, but I'm gonna let the\nappeals court hear it.\" Now, typically you have\nto get what's called a, like a right of cert, a\ncertification to appeal. You have to make sure that\nyou actually have a case. He says, \"I'm waiving the cert and I'm waiving the $500\nfee to file with them.\" He said, he basically expedites it for me. Which is a subtle way of\ntelling the prosecutor, \"I think he's got something\nand I'm sending it up there.\" And the way he writes his motion, it's basically saying, \"I\ndon't have the jurisdiction to hear it, to do anything, but they do. They need to do it. And I'm paving the way. You don't have to pay any money and you don't need that cert.\" So the prosecution immediately comes back, they file a one level reduction. And we immediately, Frank\nfiles something saying, \"Hey, stop. We don't want the reduction. We don't want the one level.\nWe wanna come back to court. Please don't, don't rule on it.\" So the judge says, \"Okay,\nI'm freezing everything. I'm putting a stay on everything. I'm gonna give this guy a lawyer to try and figure out\nwhat you're gonna do.\" They fly down a lawyer, Leanne Weber. So she comes and she comes and sees me, and she says, \"Listen, I\nsee that you want to go back and fight this and this but honestly, I don't think you're gonna get\nanything more than one level. I talked to the prosecution. They said, they'll give\nyou,\" Well, she said, \"I can work on trying\nto get you two levels, but you don't have much of a prayer, you're gonna get crushed.\" And I said, \"Well then why are you here? If they can crush me so\neasy, why don't they do it? Why would they pay you?\" Like they pay them like 12 grand or something just to fly down and all your expenses to negotiate for me. Why not crush me? And she's like, \"I don't know.\" I said, \"Well, Frank said four levels.\" And she's like, \"Who's Frank?\" I go, \"Frank's the guy\nthat wrote all this.\" And she's like, \"Oh, is he an attorney?\" And I go, \"Is he in here?\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, he's in here.\" She's like, \"Why is he in here?\" And I tell her, he was\ntaking over the world. And she says, \"That's\nthe strangest thing I've ever heard my entire life.\" And I said, \"I understand. But Frank said,\" and she's\nlike, \"You're listening to an incompetent, you know?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, absolutely. And Frank said, four\nlevel, we want four levels. He said, for me to tell\nyou we want four levels.\" She goes, \"Okay.\" She leaves, she goes to the US Attorney, we argue two levels. They come back and say, two levels. No, we go back and forth. We start filing motions saying we want to go back, we want a hearing. We wanna bring back all the FBI agents, the Secret Service agents. And she's like, \"What? Do you wanna turn this into a circus?\" \"Exactly what do I wanna do, I'm gonna turn it into the biggest circus, 'cause I've already got one level.\" They come back one day, she says, \"Listen, three levels is the\nbest you're gonna get.\" She said, \"So I guess you'll be moved back here, we'll go to the hearing.\" I said, \"No, no, no,\nI'll take three levels.\" And she goes, \"What are you talking?\" She said, \"You said four levels. You said Frank wouldn't take, let you take anything less than four.\" I said, \"No, Frank said to tell you four. I was happy with three. I\nwanted you to argue for four. I'm good with three. I'm\noutta here in like a year.\" So, and I don't wanna be moved back. I don't wanna have to get on that bus, you know what it's like to be moved? It's horrible. So I said, \"I just want the three levels.\" So then we argue about\nthe wording for about two, three months, and then they file it. And then I get five years\nknocked off my sentence because three levels at this, at the level I was at\nnow isn't seven years. Every level you get a little less time. So I get five years off. So now I've got 12 years\nknocked off my sentence. At this point, I maybe have a year and a half to go. And, you know, that's doable. So I was super, super happy. And I'm gonna tell you something and I'm sorry, bro. But every time I think about it, and I just feel like I have to say it. Like Frank, I'm gonna go insane. But I can, like, I didn't have a fucking\nprayer without that guy. And as crazy as he is, and much of a pain in the ass as he was like, I could never repay him, bro. Like, I'm not, I shouldn't be here. I'm supposed to be in prison right now. My out date was 30, was 2030 without that guy. - Where is he now?\n- He got himself out. He didn't do all that\ntime. He got himself out. I don't even know how he did it. They've even threw him back\nin prison again for six months and he got himself out again. He's insane. He's incredible. He's insane, but he's incredible. - Is he really that insane? - He's in Orlando. - Is he, I mean, he seems like he seems like a good\nlawyer and a good man. - He, look, he's, he's,\nhe's great. He's great. I mean, there's no doubt in\nmy mind I would be in prison right now if it wasn't for him. - And he is done this for others? - Walk people right out, 10\nyears off, five years off, nine years off, 10 years. I mean, it's, I didn't pay and\nI didn't pay for one thing. I didn't pay for my stamps.\nHe paid for everything. - Sounds like the other lawyers don't really believe it's possible and he does. It's interesting. - Well, I think he's willing to, he's willing to badger\nthem into doing, you know, what they should have done to begin with. I actually wrote a book\nabout it, which he loved - About him.\n- About him and his story. His, it's so over the top\nwhat happened with him. I mean, literally tried\nto take over the Congo. I mean, there's a documentary about it. There's, it's called\n\"Nine Days In The Congo.\" It's an insane story. That's one of those\nstories that's just like, how is this not a movie? - It's not a movie yet?\n- No, I don't, I've pitched it several times and it'd be, it would be great. But, so I wrote a synopsis\nand I turned that into a book. - What's the name of the book? - Oh, \"It's Insanity.\" - \"It's Insanity.\"\n- Yeah. But about it, like a\nyear and a half later, like, I ended up getting out of prison and I went to the halfway house. - What'd that feel like? Freedom. - I was, oh, this is bad, bro, this is bad. I remember when I was leaving the prison. So, you know, I met some\ngreat guys in prison, which is a weird thing to say, but I've met better, I met\nbetter people in prison than I'd ever met outside\nprison at that low. I mean, because it was the first time I actually had friends, you\nknow, like I really had someone that wanted to hang out\nwith me just to like, I didn't, I didn't have\nanything to offer them. I can't make you any money.\nI can't do anything for you. We're just hanging out\nbecause we like to laugh or we have things in common, or we are fascinated by each other, or we just have good time and fun. So when I was leaving, I\nremember my mom showed up and my brother showed\nup and they picked me up and we were driving off. And I remember looking back at the prison and my brother said, Paul, \"I'm glad, I'll bet you're\nglad to see that,\" you know, \"To leave that behind you.\" And I started crying. It's like nobody talked. I was so uncomfortable. It was, I started crying and it wasn't because I\nwas like, oh, it's over. It was because it was like\nsurvivor's guilt, you know? Like I was leaving all of my friends and I felt so bad that I was leaving them. But I went to the halfway\nhouse and I had four. So when I was getting\nout, I remember joking that I had exhausted my Trulincs account, my inmate account. I'd exhausted it. I had nothing. I had like 18 cents. I couldn't even figure\nout how to spend it. And they give you a debit\ncard when you leave. And I said, like, and they charge you every time you swipe, you use the card. Like, I don't even have\nenough to spend the 18 cents. You know, it's 'cause\nthe charge is like $3. So I was like, I was like, \"Yeah, yeah.\" I was like, \"I wonder if they're still giving me my debit card.\" And I'm laughing. Everybody's like, \"What\nare you going to eat? What are you this, what are that?\" And my one buddy looked\nat me, he was like, \"You can't go to the halfway\nhouse with nothing, bro.\" And I was like, \"No, it's cool.\" I said, \"No, it's cool, you\nknow?\" I said, \"No, it's cool.\" I said, \"I want to start at the bottom. I've got that coming. I got working at McDonald's, coming, so I'm gonna work at McDonald's. I don't give a fuck.\" And he was like, \"Well, I think I,\" he goes, \"I think you're\ngonna need to buy clothes. I think that's,\" said, \"Oh, it's so.\" I said, \"It's at the Goodwill.\" They'll give you a bunch of, they give you a bunch of crap\nif you don't have anything, if you're indigent. And I said, \"I'm indigent.\" And a couple days before I'm leaving, $400 ends up on my account. And I was like, what the fuck? And it was from a buddy of mine, and I go to him, my buddy Tommy, and I was like, \"Tommy,\" I go, \"Did you put $400 on my account?\" And he said, \"I can't let\nyou go with nothing, bro.\" So I get to the halfway\nhouse and I go to Walmart and I buy $300 worth\nof clothes at Walmart. I've never been in a Walmart. I go to a super Walmart, it's huge. And I go there and I\nbuy a bunch of clothes and I buy about 300\nbucks worth of clothes. And I still have some of the blue jeans, to this day I still wear\nsome of the blue jeans. And I stayed in the halfway house. And I called the buddy of mine named Treon, Treon Calta. And he owns a gym. And you know, I grew up\nwith him, his whole family. Like, they owned a bunch of gyms. And I called him and I said, \"Hey man,\nI'm in a halfway house.\" And he was like, \"Hey, what's going on?\" He said, \"Can I do anything for you?\" And I was like, \"I mean, I need a job.\" I didn't think he was gonna gimme a job. He goes, \"Bro, you're\nhired. I'll give you a job.\" He said, \"I can, minimum wage.\" I said, \"That's fine, if\nI can stay outta here,\" you can work like 80 hours a week. And I was like, \"If I can\njust stay outta here 80 hours and you pay me minimum wage,\" he goes, \"Oh, hell yeah, perfect.\" So I'm at the gym and I got free reign. So I'm playing on my\ncomputer goofing off all day. And my buddy, Pete, who's still locked up, he's texting me and calling me. And he is like, not texting me. Like he's emailing me\nthrough the CorrLinks system. And he calls me periodically. He's like, \"Have you started a website?\" 'Cause one of the things I was gonna do when I got out was I was\ngonna start a website with all these stories that I'd written. And I was like, \"No,\nPete, I don't, I can't, like, I don't have a computer.\" He's like, \"Well, how much is a computer?\" I was like, \"I don't know,\nthey're like 300 bucks.\" I was like, I don't, I said, \"I could probably get a\nused Apple like MacBook, like a five-year-old MacBook or something, I don't know, for like 3, 4, 300 $50, whatever.\" And I said, but he was like, \"Okay, so that's all you need, 300 bucks.\" I go, \"No, no, no, no.\" I\nsaid, \"It's not 300 bucks, bro. It's 300 bucks plus it's\ngetting a WordPress website,\" which I said costs money. Plus it's hiring somebody\nto help me figure it out because I don't, I'm inept. I don't know how anything works. So he, okay. And I said, \"Plus I need\nthis, plus I need this. I need a bunch of stuff.\nI need $600 for this. I need 300 for this. I need 500 for this. I need $1,000 for this.\" And he goes, \"Okay.\" He said, \"I'm gonna, I'll\nget you. Okay, I got it.\" So he reads off a list, he goes, \"I got you,\" but Pete\ndoesn't have any money. And I go, \"How are you\ngonna gimme any money?\" He goes, \"Every day I walk\nacross the compound some,\" he goes, \"People stop me\nand say, 'how's Cox doing?'\" And I say, \"Oh, he's okay.\" And they say, \"Does he need anything?\" And I say, \"No, no, he's good.\" He said, \"I'm gonna start\ntelling these fuckers yeah. Yeah, he needs something. You wanna do something for\nhim. Here's what he needs.\" I ended up getting two laptops sent to me. I got the computer program Final Cut Pro. I had guys in prison cutting me checks so that I could build a website and put all these stories on the website. So I start putting the website and I don't know what I'm doing, man. I mean, I put them on the website slowly. It takes forever. I'm putting pictures up. I'm trying to figure out how, you know, Photoshop works, how\nall this stuff, right? The whole time I was, I wanted to start, 'cause everybody, the last one, I was just getting outta prison. Everybody kept telling me like, \"Bro, you gotta start a podcast. You gotta start a true crime podcast.\" And I don't know what a podcast is. The term podcast came\ninto existence in 2009 when I'd been locked up three years. I'd never been on YouTube.\n- Yeah. - So by the time I get out the last year or two guys are coming up\nto me giving me magazines. \"Like, this is what a\npod you need to read, Look true crime's huge. And you got the thing, guys\nare asking me every couple of days, \"Cox, you got any stories?\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, yeah.\nDid you read 'Cash And Coke?'\" And they're like, \"Is that the one where the guys are\nrobbing the drug dealer?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Oh no, no. I read that one.\" \"Did you read this one?\" \"No, no, no, I haven't read that. That's the one with\nthe guy,\" and I'm like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\" So I mean, so I'm giving\nthese little stories and then they'd come\nback and give them to me. You know, it's, you don't have, you don't have anything in there, right? So this is guys that would never read in\ntheir life are reading. And I'm writing about the guy in B2, the guy in C1. So I put up the whole thing and they're, well anyway, they're all telling me\ndo a true crime podcast. true crime podcast, I don't\nreally know what that is, but by now I'm starting to\nlisten to them on YouTube, you know, serial and cold case files, you know, that kind of stuff. And I think that's what I want to do. Well, my buddy Treon says,\n\"There's a guy named Danny Jones that runs a podcast called 'Concrete,' and it's in St. Petersburg and he lives a couple miles from me. I see him all the time.\" And I went, \"Okay.\" And he said, \"You should email him. He's got a guy on there all\nthe time that does real estate. And I go, I just got outta prison for bank fraud related to real estate. He doesn't wanna interview me.\" He goes, \"Well, you could, maybe he does, maybe you could ask him\nabout starting a podcast.\" Okay. So I sent him an email. I remember Danny called me and he said, \"Hey, is this Matt Cox?\" I was like, \"Yeah, this is Matt.\" He's like, \"I got your email. This is Danny Jones.\" And I was like, okay. And he says, \"Yeah, I\ngot your email, bro.\" He goes, \"This is a good fucking email.\" I was like, \"What?\" He goes, \"I get a lot of emails, bro.\" He said, \"That is a-\"\n- It's a good one. - \"That's a good one.\" He said, \"That was really good. Like, I mean, that was well written.\" He's like, \"Like I immediately\nknew I had to talk to you.\" And I said, \"Oh, okay.\" I said, 'cause you know, I start off with, I think I started off with,\n\"Hey, my name's Matt Cox and I'm a conman.\" - Good opening.\n- \"I was recently released from federal prison.\" And so he was like, \"Oh yeah,\nI mean, who, who says that?\" So anyway, he said,\n\"Well, what's going on?\" I said, \"Well,\" and I\ntell him what's going on? I wanna start a podcast, blah, blah, blah. And you know, Danny, he\nlistens to me for 30 minutes to an hour and I've heard\nthis and this and that. He's like, \"Yeah, right.\" He's, \"You know, YouTube's\nnot really like that. And that's not really how we do it. And you know, I don't know that you're, you're gonna have to get\na production company,\" and blah, blah, blah. He goes, \"But you know what? What you really need to do is to see if people are even\ninterested in you or your story, or you're able to talk. You should come on my show.\" You know, shameless.\n- Yeah. - Trying to get some content. - Well, I mean, so as I\ntold you, offline, Danny and \"Concrete Podcast\" is really good. So people should definitely listen to it. - Yeah.\n- But yeah, I mean, it turns out people do\nlike listening to you. - Turns out.\n- I mean, you're good at, telling stories.\n- Well, anyway, by the time I got, I\ncouldn't do Danny's podcast. I was like, \"I can't do it,\nbro. I'm in the halfway house,\" so maybe I get outta the halfway house and a couple months go by. Just maybe two months, three months go by. And one day I get a phone call from Danny. He's like, \"Bro, you're outta\nthe halfway house, right?\" And I was like, 'cause I\ntold him I got out in July, it was like October, November. I'm like, \"Right.\" He's like, \"Listen, I\nhad a guest fall through. I got nobody. I need you to come on. I answered all your questions,\nyou know, I'd call them five, six times, you know, and you said.\" And I was like, \"Ah.\" I was like, \"I'll, fuck it, I'll do it.\" That video got like a 2 million views. Then I did Patrick Bet-David flew me out. Then I did Soft White\nUnderbelly, you know, then I did Vlad, then I did all, like, people started, and I'm sorry. And then, you know, it just blew up. And then people started asking me to come and, you know, talk for no\nreason for, which was crazy. But you were saying, I'm sorry. - Is your dad still with us? - No, he died when I was in prison. He came to see me. Yeah, he came to see me\nlike two or three times. - When is the first time he found out that you were doing fraud? - The first time I got in trouble. - When you got the probation?\n- Yeah, because I had, you know, I had to kind of explain that, you know, like something's happening. I didn't want him to\nhear from anybody else. - So you talked to him directly about it. - Super disappointed.\n- Did he ever tell you he loves you after that? - So after I got the 26 years and the government\ndecided they weren't going to indict anybody, and I really\nwas like, wow, this is it. Like, you're done. He came to see me, but just by himself. And I remember he, I remember\nwhen he came to see me, I, you know, he was by, he was by himself. Like he never came by himself. So I remember thinking my mom,\nsomething happened to my mom and like, as soon as I walked\nin, you know, he walked in. I, what hap, I go, \"Where's mom?\" And he goes, \"Oh no,\nshe's fine, she's fine.\" And he sat down with me and he said. and he said, \"How are you doing?\" I was like, \"I'm good.\" And he was just like, you\nknow, he was getting sick, he was getting older. So, you know, we talked for a little bit just about the situation. And I was like, \"Yeah, I mean,\" he's like, \"Well, what are you gonna do?\" And I was like, you know,\n\"There's nothing I can do. Like everybody, I've\ncalled multiple attorneys. I've talked to people,\nthere's nothing I can do.\" And he was like, you know, \"We are gonna, you're\ngonna figure it out.\" You know, he goes, he said, \"You're clever and you're smart and you're gonna, you're not\ngonna do all of that time.\" And I was like, \"I'm done. It's over. I'm gonna get outta here when\nI'm 60 if I behave myself. And if I don't, I'll be 64.\" And he was like, \"That's\nnot gonna happen.\" And, so he said, I think that\nwas the first time he, you know, I knew he was proud of me when I was making\nmoney, but he never said it. You know, you got the look\nlike he was like impressed. But we were sitting there and\nhe said, I remember he said, 'cause it's the only time I can ever remember him saying\nhe was proud of me. And I remember he said,\n\"You're gonna figure this out.\" He said, \"I'm not proud\nof where you ended up, but you've done amazing things. You know, I wish you'd use your talents for something different,\nbut you've done things that I could have never done. And you've led an amazing, adventurous life and I'm proud of you.\" And that, you know.\n- I wish he could see you now. - My mom, I know my mom saw me. My mom's funny, 'cause\nmy mom came to see me. My mom's a gangster. My mom came to see me every\ntwo weeks for 13 years. She missed about a month and\na half when she had a stroke and ended up in a wheelchair. And then she came in the wheelchair and she would make my brother bring her. My brother and sister would be like, \"Mom, are you sure you want to go? Like, you know, it's so hard to, it's such a long drive\nand you get so tired.\" \"Well, I'll sleep in the car.\" \"I know, but you know, then you, we have to wait in that, the, you know, in that the waiting\narea, you know, forever. And it takes forever.\" \"Well, I'm in the\nwheelchair, so I'm fine.\" \"Well, I know, but it's such a pain to get in and out and then in and out.\" And she goes like, she goes, \"I'm going to see my son\nand you're taking me.\" - I love it.\n- She, yeah, so I. So she, yeah, she was,\nshe was something else. And I always say, you know, like if I had to say. You know, I don't think about all the things I did to get out. Like I know, you know, there's\nall these guys that are, you know, like, you know, \"Oh,\nI wouldn't have done that. I'd have been a standup guy and I'd have been,\" well,\ngood for fucking you, bro. I wanted to get out. I wanted out. And the icing on the\ncake of me getting out and I would've cut every\nmotherfucker's head in that prison off. I was able to get out just in time to spend the last year and a half of my mother's life with her. I saw her two or three times a week, took her to dinner once a week, was able to walk, go on walks\nwith her in her wheelchair. I was sitting right next to her when she had her final stroke. to her when she had her final stroke. I held her hand when she took her last breath. I don't give a fuck. I don't give a. - Do you regret? 'Cause you just looked back? Would you do it? Would you do any part\nof your life different? - Oh, I'd scrap all this. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'd scrap all this to be, you know, you always hear these guys\nsay, \"I wouldn't change it because it made me the man I am today.\" The man I am today is a\nfucking 54-year-old scumbag, multiple felons, starting\nmy life over broke, you know, living off of scraps, you know, trying to make YouTube work. Like, you know, I've got, you know, two dead parents. I'm divorced, I have a son\nthat doesn't talk to me. I have a son that doesn't\ntalk to me for good reason, not because of a misunderstanding, because he understands. Like you can't even argue with him. He's got a powerful argument. Like, I don't wanna be a\npart of this guy's life. He's a scumbag. He stole money. He went on the run. He abandoned me when I was,\nyou know, three years old. I don't want anything to do with him. Like, I get it. Like I, you know, and I tried\nto do all the right things, you know, I wrote the\nletters, I drew him pictures. I've tried to call and it's not happening. Like, I would do anything to go back and just be that regular middle class guy with the two kids and the\nwife working a regular job. You know, like, that's a good life. You know, those are, that's a good person. And you know, I just made one arrogant\ndecision after another, after another until it snowballed and I couldn't take it back. And then I did everything I could. And if I wasn't the calculating, backstabbing scumbag\nmotherfucker that I can be, I'd be in prison right now. Sorry. You know? So, yeah. Yeah. I would much rather be a CPA right now. I would much rather, you\nknow, should have stuck with being an insurance\nadjuster or something. I mean, you know, I\nnever should have whited that 30 day late out. Never. It was a mistake. - That was your first mistake. - That was a huge mistake. - You think your son will forgive you? - No. Unfortunately, according to my ex-wife and my sister and everybody that he is a part of their lives. You know, and I've seen him, you know, my mother's funeral, I saw him, you know, I've seen him\nat several functions. You look across and he\nlooks right through me. I think that he's a, everybody\nsays, \"He's just like you. He's just like you.\" And everybody says, I'm just like my dad. I've never smoked a cigarette.\nI've never drank alcohol. Not a drop. Never done any drugs because my dad was an alcoholic and my dad smoked two packs a day and everything in our\nhouse reeked of nicotine. And I've never smoked. And\nmy dad was a pill head. He was always on some kind\nof prescription medication. He was draw, you know,\nand I didn't want to, I don't want to, I didn't\nwanna be that person. And like one day I drew a line in the sand and I wouldn't do it. And I think he's drawn a line in the sand and he's decided, you know, this is the hill I'm gonna die on. And I'm not gonna back off it. And the thing is, my ex-wife tells him, \"This, he's a good person. You should be in his life.\" His father, 'cause he was\nadopted when I was in prison. They adopted him. Nick is\nhis, you know, his dad. Nick has told him. Nick came to see me when I was in prison. You know, Nick has told him like, \"Hey, you, this is a mistake. You're making a mistake.\" Nick, everybody that knows me knows him. And he said, he has said no. So I fully believe it's no,\nI mean, I hope it's not. - Well, I hope he forgives you. I think there's a lot of good in you, despite you calling yourself a scumbag over and over in this podcast. - That keeps bothering you.\nYou mentioned that earlier. - What advice would you\ngive to young people given that you've lived quite\na non-standard life? What advice would you give them how to live a life they can be proud of? - I mean, I don't know if I'm in a position to, that anybody would listen\nto me, but I 'cause to me, and I don't have any advice that I don't think a\nfather would give you. And it's like, work hard, be appreciative. I mean, things are so good out here. I hear people complain all the time. And I think a huge part of just being happy is being appreciative. Like, I didn't appreciate anything. When I had, this is so cliche, but when I had all the money\nin the world, I was miserable. But when I got out with\nnothing, I was happier in prison with nothing than I was with two or $3 million prior to prison and driving, dating a chick I never\nshould have been dating, driving a sports car, vacationing all over the world, miserable. I'm crying, driving away from prison because I already miss my friends. Now you could have never told\nme that was gonna happen. - Turns out money, in fact\ndoes not buy happiness. - No, and I know, and it,\nit is such a cliche, right? But it's so true. - Crying, driving away from prison. Yeah. - You know what? I met my wife in the halfway house, so she had just gotten outta prison. She was in the halfway house with me. She just did five years\nfor like a meth conspiracy. I never would've met her\nif I didn't go to prison. You know?\n- And now your date night is hunting alligators together. - Yeah, that was like a month or so ago. - This is Florida, folks. This what, this is what, this is what badass people do in Florida. - My wife-\n- Hog hunting. - Is a former, she used to, so she was an MP in the military. She was, she did, she hunted, she ran a hog hunting tour guide service for six years.\n- Right. Yeah. - Went to prison for five years, got out, and then, you know, now\nshe's a marine mechanic. And yeah, our date night,\nthe other night was, we went in the middle of the night, went to Lake Okeechobee and went hog, went to alligator hunting. - Yeah, and if I may say\nso, she's quite beautiful. - Thank you. And I did, I did nice. She didn't wanna date me\nin the halfway house too. I kept saying, \"I feel\nlike you're sweet on me.\" She's like, \"I'm not, I'm not. I make fun of guys like\nyou. You're a city boy.\" I'm like, \"I don't know. I feel like- - Well, you wore her down. - That's what exactly what I did. - Yeah. It's that\ncharisma. It always works. Well, Matt, thank you for being so honest. Thank you for being who you are. I do think there's a lot of good in you. And thank you for telling your story and the story of others who have, who've made mistakes in their life. Thank you for talking today. - I appreciate you having me on. - That was a really short conversation. Thanks for listening to this\nconversation with Matthew Cox.
