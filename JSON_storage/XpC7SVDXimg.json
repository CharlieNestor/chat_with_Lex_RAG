      "text": "- We should never, and I\nnever sit aside and say, oh, they're just threatening to destroy us. They won't do it. If somebody threatens to eliminate you as Iran is doing today, and as Hitler did then\nand people discounted it, well, if somebody\nthreatens to annihilate us, take them seriously and\nact to prevent it early on. Don't let them have the means to do so because that may be too late. - The following is a conversation\nwith Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, currently serving his\nsixth term in office. He's one of the most\ninfluential, powerful, and controversial men in the world, leading a right-wing coalition government at the center of one of the most intense and long-lasting conflicts\nin crises in human history. As we spoke, and as I speak now, large scale protests are\nbreaking out all over Israel over this government's\nproposed judicial reform that seeks to weaken the Supreme Court in a bold accumulation of power. Given the current intense\npolitical battles in Israel, our previous intention\nto speak for three hours was adjusted to one\nhour for the time being, but we agreed to speak again\nfor much longer in the future, I will also interview\npeople who harshly disagree with word spoken in this conversation, I will speak with other world leaders, with religious leaders, with\nhistorians and activists, and with people who have\nlived and have suffered through the pain of war, destruction and loss that stoke the fires of anger and hate in their heart. For this, I will travel anywhere\nno matter how dangerous. If there's any chance it may help add to understanding\nand love in the world. I believe in the power of\nconversation to do just this, to remind us of our common humanity. I know I'm underqualified\nand under-skilled for these conversations, so I will often fall short and I will certainly get\nattacked, derided and slandered, but I will always turn the other\ncheek and use these attacks to learn to improve, and no matter what, never give into cynicism. This life, this world\nof ours is too beautiful not to keep trying, trying to do some good in\nwhatever way each of us know how. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman\npodcast, to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear, dear friends,\nhere's Benjamin Netanyahu."

      "section": "Hate",
      "text": "You're loved by many people\nhere in Israel and in the world, but you're also hated by many. In fact, I think you may be one of the most hated men in the world. So if there's a young man\nor a young woman listening to this right now who have\nsuch hate in their heart, what can you say to them to one day turn that hate into love? - I disagree with the\npremise of your question. I think I've enjoyed a very broad support around the world. There are certain corners in\nwhich we have this animosity that you describe and it sort of permeates in some of the newspapers\nand the news organs and so on in the United States. But it certainly doesn't reflect the broad support that I have. I just gave an interview\non an Iranian channel, 16 million viewers. I gave another one, just a\nlittle video a few years ago. 25 million viewers from Iran. Certainly no hate there. I have to tell you, not\nfrom the regime, okay? And when I go around the\nworld and I've been around the world, people want to\nhear what we have to say, what I have to say, as a leader of Israel whom they respect increasingly as a rising power in the world. So I disagree with that. And the most important thing\nthat goes against what you said is the respect that we\nreceived from the Arab world, and the fact that we've made\nfour historic peace agreements with Arab countries, they made it with me. They didn't make it with anyone else. And I respect them and they respect me, and probably more to come. So I think the premise\nis wrong, that's all. - Well, there's a lot of love. Yes, a lot of leaders\nare collaborating are. - Respect, I said not, not love. - Okay, all right. Well, it's a spectrum, but there is people who\ndon't have good things to say about Israel, who do have hate in\ntheir heart for Israel. - [Benjamin] Yeah. - And what can you say to those people? - Well, I think they don't know very much. I think they're guided\nby a lot of ignorance. They don't know about Israel. They don't know that Israel\nis a stellar democracy, that it happens to be one of the most advanced\nsocieties on the planet. That what Israel develops helps humanity in every field in medicine and agriculture and in the environment and telecoms, and talk about AI in a minute, but changing the world for the better and spreading this among six continents. We've sent rescue teams\nmore than any other country in the world, and we're one 10th of 1% of the world's population. But when there's an earth\nearthquake or a devastation in Haiti or in the\nPhilippines, Israel is there. When there's an earthquake, devastating earthquake in\nTurkey, Israel was there. When there's something in\nNepal, Israel is there, and it's the second country. It's the second country\nafter in one case, India or after another case, the\nUnited States, Israel is there. Tiny Israel is a benefactor\nto all of humanity. - So you're a student of history. If I can just linger on that\nphilosophical notion of hate, that part of human nature,\nif you look at World War II, what do you learn from human nature, from the rise of the Third\nReich and the rise of somebody like Hitler and the hate\nthat permeates that? - Well, what I've learned is that you have to nip\nbad things in the bud. You have to, there's a\nLatin term that says. stop bad things when they're small. And the deliberate hatred, the incitement of hatred\nagainst one community, its demonization,\ndelegitimization that goes with it is a very dangerous thing. And that happened in the case of the Jews, what started with the Jews\nsoon spread to all of humanity. So what we've learned is\nthat's what we should never, and I never sit aside and say, oh, they're just threatening to\ndestroy us, they won't do it. If somebody threatens to eliminate you as Iran is doing today,\nand as Hitler did then and people discounted it, well, if somebody\nthreatens to annihilate us, take them seriously and\nact to prevent it early on. Don't let them have the means to do so, because that may be too late. - So in those threats\nunderlying that hatred, how much of it is anti-Zionism and how much of it is anti-Semitism? - I don't distinguish between the two. You can't say, well, I'm okay with Jews, but I just don't think there\nshould be a Jewish state. It's like saying, I'm not anti-American. I just don't think there\nshould be an America. That's basically what people are saying vis-a-vis anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. When you're say anti-Zionism, you're saying the Jewish\npeople don't have a right to have a state of their own. And that is a denial of a basic principle that I think completely\nunmasks what is involved here. Today, anti-Semitism is anti-Zionism. Those who oppose the Jewish\npeople oppose the Jewish state."

      "section": "Judicial reform and protests",
      "text": "- If we jump from human history to the current particular moment, there's protests in Israel now about the proposed judicial\nreform that gives power to your government to\noverride the Supreme Court. So the critics say that this\ngives too much power to you, virtually making you a dictator. - Yeah, well, that's ridiculous. The mere fact that you\nhave so many demonstrations and protests, some dictatorship, huh? (person laughing) There's a lot of democracy here. More rambunctious and more robust than just anywhere on the planet. - Can you steel man the case that this may give too much power to the coalition government,\nto the prime minister, not just to you, but to those who follow. - No, I think that's complete hogwash, because I think there's very few people are demonstrating against this. Quite a few, quite many don't have an idea what\nis being discussed, basically being sloganized. You can sloganize, you know something about\nnot mass media right now, but the social network, you can basically feed deliberately with big data and big money. You can just feed slogans\nand get into people's minds. I'm sure you don't think I exaggerate, because you can tell me more about that. And you can create mass mobilization based on these absurd slogans. So here's where we I come\nfrom and what we're doing, what we're trying to do, and what we've changed in\nwhat we're trying to do. I'm a 19th century\ndemocrat in my small D yes, in my views. That is, I asked the\nquestion, what is democracy? Okay, so democracy is\nthe will of the majority and the protection of the rights, they call it the rights of the minority. But I say the rights of\nthe individual, okay. So how do you balance the two? Okay, how do you avoid mobocracy? Okay, and how do you avoid dictatorship? The opposite side, the way you avoid it is something\nthat was built essentially by British philosophers\nand French philosophers, but was encapsulated\nby the founding fathers of the United States. You create a balance\nbetween the three branches of government, okay? The legislative, the\nexecutive and the judiciary. And this balance is\nwhat assures the balance between majority rights\nand individual rights. And you have to balance all of them, okay? That balance was maintained in\nIsrael in its first 50 years, and was gradually overtaken\nand basically broken by the most activist\njudicial court on the planet. That's what happened here. And gradually over the\nlast two, three decades, the court aggregated for itself the powers of the parliament\nand the executive. So we're trying to\nbring it back into line, bringing it back into line, into what is common in all\nparliamentary democracies. And in the United States\ndoesn't mean taking the pendulum from one side and bringing\nit to the other side. We want checks and balances,\nnot unrivaled power, just as we said, we want\nan independent judiciary but not in all powerful judiciary. That balance does not mean\nbringing it back into line. Doesn't mean that you can have the Parliament override any decision that\nthe Supreme Court does. So I pretty much early on said, after the judicial reform was introduced, get rid of the idea of a\nsweeping override clause that would have, with 61\nvotes, that's majority of one. You can just nullify any\nSupreme Court decision. So let's move it back into the center. So that's gone. And most of the criticism\non the judicial reform was based on a an\nunlimited override clause, which I've said is\nsimply not gonna happen. People are discussing some something that already for six\nmonths does not exist. The second point that\nwe received criticism on was the structure of how do you\nchoose Supreme Court judges? Okay, how do you choose them? And the critics of the reform\nare saying that the idea that elected officials should\nchoose Supreme Court judges is the end of democracy. If that's the case, the United\nStates is not a democracy. Neither is France, and neither\nare just, I don't know, just about every, every\ndemocracy on the planet. So there is a view here that\nyou can't have the sorted hands of elected officials involved\nin the choosing of judges. And in the Israeli system, the judicial activism went\nso far that effectively, the sitting judges have an effective veto on choosing judges, which means that this is\na self-selecting court that just perpetrates itself. And we want to correct that, again, want to correct it in a balanced way. And that's basically\nwhat we're trying to do. So I think there's a lot of\nmisinformation about that. We're trying to bring Israeli democracy to where it was in its first 50 years and it was a stellar democracy. It still is, Israel is a\ndemocracy, will remain a democracy, a vibrant democracy. And believe me, the fact that people are arguing and\ndemonstrating in the streets and protesting is the best proof of that. And that's how it'll remain. - We spoke about tech companies offline, there's a lot of tech companies nervous about this judicial reform. Can you speak to why\nlarge and small companies have a future in Israel? - Because Israel is a free market economy. I had something to do with that. I introduced dozens and\ndozens of free market reforms that made Israel move from $17,000 per capita income to within\nvery short time to $54,000. That's nominal GDP per capita, according to the IMF. And we've overtaken in that\nJapan, France, Britain, Germany. And how did that happen? Because we unleashed the genius that we have and the initiative and the entrepreneurship that\nis late in our population. And to do that, we had\nto create free markets. So we created that. So Israel has one of the most\nvibrant free market economies in the world, and the second thing we have is a permanent investment\nin conceptual products, because we have a permanent\ninvestment in the military, in our security services, creating basically knowledge workers who then become knowledge entrepreneurs. And so we create this structure, and that's not gonna go away. There's been a decline in investments in the high tech globally. I think that's driven by many factors. But the most important\none is the interest rate, which I think will, it'll\nfluctuate up and down, but Israel will remain a\nvery attractive country because it produces so many, so many knowledge workers in\na knowledge-based economy. And it's changing so rapidly,\nthe world is changing. You're looking for the\nplaces that have innovation. The future belongs to those who innovate. Israel is the preeminent\ninnovation nation. It has few competitors and\nif we would say, all right, where do you have this close cross-disciplinary fermentation of various skills in areas, I would say it's in Israel\nand I'll tell you why. We used to be just telecoms\nbecause people went out of the military intelligence RNSA. But that's been now broad based. So you find it in medicine, you find it in biology,\nyou find it in agritech, you find it everywhere. Everything is becoming technologized. And in Israel, everybody\nis dealing in everything. And that's a potent reservoir of talent that the world is not gonna pass up. In fact, it's coming to us. We just had Nvidia coming here, and they decided to build\na supercomputer in Israel, wonder why, we've had intel\ncoming here and deciding not to invest $25 billion just\nnow in a new plant in Israel. I wonder why. I don't wonder why, they know why, because the talent is here\nand the freedom is here, then it'll remain so."

      "section": "AI",
      "text": "- So you had a conversation\nabout AI with Sam Altman of OpenAI and with Elon Musk. - Yeah. - What was the content\nof that conversation? What's your vision for sort\nof this very highest of tech, which is artificial intelligence? - Well, first of all, I have a high regard for the people I talk to, okay? I understand that they understand\nthings I don't understand, and I don't pretend to\nunderstand everything. But I do understand one thing. I understand that AI is\ndeveloping at a geometric rate, and mostly in political life. And in life in general, people don't have an intuitive\ngrasp of geometric growth. You understand things\nbasically in linear increments. And the idea that you're\ncoming up a ski slope is very foreign to people,\nso they don't understand it. And they're naturally also\nsort of taken aback by it, because what do you do? Okay, so I think there's\nseveral conclusions from my conversations with them, and from my other observations\nthat I've been talking about for many years, I'm talking\nabout the need to do this. Well, the first thing is this, there is no possibility of not\nentering AI with full force. Secondly, there is a need for regulation. Third, it's not clear\nthere'll be global regulation. Fourth, it's not clear where it ends up. I certainly cannot say that. Now, you might say, does\nit come to control us? Okay, that's a question. Does it come to control us? I don't know the answer to that. I think that as one observation that I had from these conversations is, if it does come to control, is that's probably the only chance of having universal regulation because I don't see anyone deciding to avoid the race and cooperate unless you have that threat, doesn't mean you can't\nregulate AI within countries, even without that understanding. But it does mean that there's\na limit to regulation, because every country will\nwanna make sure that it's not, doesn't give up competitive advantage if there is no universal regulation. I think that right now, 10 years ago I read a novel. I don't read novels, but I was forced to read\none by a scientific advisor. I read history, I read about economics, I read about technology,\nI just don't read novels. Okay, and this time\nfollow Churchill, he said, fact is better than fiction. Well, this fiction would become fact. And it was a book, it was a novel about a Chinese American future cyber war. And I read the book, one sitting called in a team of experts. And I said, all right, let's turn Israel into one of\nthe world's five cyber powers, and let's do it very quickly. And we did actually, we did exactly that. I think AI is bigger than\nthat and related to that, because it'll affect, well,\ncyber affects everything, but AI will affect it\neven more fundamentally. And the joining of the two\ncould be very powerful. So I think in Israel, we have to do it anyway\nfor security reasons, and we're doing it. But I think, what about our databases that are already very robust\non the medical records of 98% of our population? Why don't we stick a\ngenetic database on that? Why don't we do other things\nthat could bring magical what are seemingly magical cures and drugs and medical instruments for that? That's one possibility. We have it as I said,\nin every single field. The conclusion is this,\nwe have to move on AI, we are moving on ai just\nas we moved on cyber. And I think Israel will be one of the leading AI powers in the world. The questions I don't have an\nanswer to is where does it go? How much does it chew up on jobs? There's an assumption\nthat I'm not sure is true, that all previous, the two big previous revolutions\nin the human condition, namely the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution, definitely produced more\njobs than they consumed. Okay, that is not obvious to me at all. I mean, I could see new\njobs creating, and yes, I have that comforting statement, but it's not quite true\nbecause I think on balance, they'll probably consume more jobs, many more jobs than they'll create. - At least in the short term. And we don't know about the long term. - No, I don't know about the long term, but I used to have the comfort\nbeing a free market guy, I always said, we're\ngonna produce more jobs by limiting certain government jobs. We're actually putting out in the market. We'll create more jobs,\nwhich obviously happened. We had one telecom company,\na government company. When I said, we're going to\ncreate competition, they said, you're gonna run us out, we're\nnot gonna have more workers. Yeah, they had 13,000 workers. They went down to seven, but we created another 40,000\nin the other companies. So that was a comforting thought. I always knew that was true, okay? Not only that, I also knew that wealth\nwould spread by opening up the markets completely\nopposite to the socialist and semi-socialist Cree\nthat they had here. They said, you're gonna\nmake the rich richer and the poor poorer, no,\nI made everyone richer. And actually, the people\nwho entered the job market, because of the reforms we did,\nactually became a lot richer. On the lower ladders of\nthe socioeconomic measure. But here's the point, I don't know. I don't know, that we will\nnot have what Elon Musk calls the end of scarcity. So you'll have the end of scarcity, you'll have enormous productivity. Very few people are producing\nenormous added value. You're gonna have to tax that\nto pass it to the others. Okay, you're gonna have to do that. That's a political question. I'm not sure how we answer that. What if you tax and\nsomebody else doesn't tax? You're gonna get everybody to go there. That's an issue, an international issue that we\nconstantly have to deal with. And the second question you have is, suppose you solve that problem\nand you deliver money, okay, to those who are not\ninvolved in the AI economy, what do they do? The first question you ask somebody whom you just met after the polite, the polite exchanges is what do you do? Right, well, people define\nthemselves by their profession. And it's gonna be difficult if\nyou don't have a profession. And people will spend\nmore time self searching, they'll more time in the\narts, more time and leisure. I understand that if I have\nto bet it will annihilate many more jobs, than it will create, and it'll force a structural\nchange in our economics, in our economic models,\nand in our politics. And I'm not sure where it's gonna go. - And that's something\nwe have to respond to at the nation level and just\nas a human civilization, both the threat of AI to\njust us as a human species, and then the effect on the\njobs, and like you said, cybersecurity. - And what do you think, you\nthink we're gonna lose control? - No, I, first of all, I do believe maybe naively\nthat it will create more jobs than it takes. - Write that down and we'll check it. - It's on record. And, we don't say we'll\ncheck it after our lifetime. No, we'll see it in a few years. - We'll see it in a few years. I'm really concerned about\ncybersecurity and the nature of how that changes with the power of AI. And in terms of existential threats, I think there will be so much threats that aren't existential along the way that that's the thing I'm\nmostly concerned about, versus AI taking complete control and becoming sort of\nsuperseding the human species. Although that is something\nyou should consider seriously because of the exponential\ngrowth of its capability. - Yeah, it's exactly\nthe exponential growth which we understand is before\nus, but we don't really, it's very hard to project forward. - [Lex] To really understand. - That's, right, exactly right. So, you know, I deal with what I can and where I can affect something, I tend not to worry about\nthings I don't control. Because at a certain point,\nyou know, there's no point. I mean, you have to decide what you're spending your time on. So I think in practical terms, we'll make Israel a formidable AI power. We understand the limitation\nof scale, computing power and other things. But I think within the, those limits, I think we can make here\nthis miracle that we, we did in many other things,\nwe do more with less. I don't care if it's water, the production of water or\nthe production of energy, energy or the production of\nknowledge or the production of cyber capabilities, defense and other, we just do more with\nless, and I think in AI, we're gonna do a lot more with\nrelatively small but highly gifted population, very gifted. - So taking a small tangent,\nas we talked about offline,"

      "text": "you have a background in Taekwondo? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll mention Elon Musk. I've trained with both. Just as a quick question, who are you betting on in a fight? - Well, I refuse to answer that. I will say this. - A politician you are. - Yeah, of course, here, I'm a politician. I'm openly telling you that\nI'm dodging the question. Okay, but I'll say this,\nyou know, I actually, I spent five years in our special forces in the military, and we barely spent a\nminute on martial arts. I actually learned Taekwondo\nlater when I came to, it wasn't even atm, MIT,\nat MIT think I did karate. But when I came to the UN,\nI had a martial arts expert, and he taught me Taekwondo,\nwhich was kind of interesting. Now, the question you\nreally have to ask is, why did we learn martial arts\nin this special elite unit? And the answer is, there's no point. If you saw Indiana Jones,\nyou know, there's no point. You just pull the trigger, that simple. Now, I don't expect\nanyone to pull the trigger on this combat, and I'm sure you'll make\nsure that doesn't happen. - Yeah, I mean, martial\narts is this kind of, it's bigger than just combat. It's this kind of journey\nof humility and it has, it's an art form, it truly is an art. But it's fascinating\nthat these two figures in tech are facing each other. And I won't ask a question\nof who you would face and how you would do, but. - Well, I'm facing opponents all the time. - [Lex] All the time? - Yeah, that's part of life, part of life. - [Lex] Not yet. - Part of life is competition. The only time competition ends is death. But, political life, economic life, cultural life is engaged\ncontinuously in creativity and competition. And the problem I have with\nthat is as I mentioned earlier, just before we began the podcast, is that at a certain point, you want to put barriers to monopoly. And if you are in a\nreally able competitor, you're gonna create a monopoly. That's what Peter Thiel says\nis a natural course of things. It's what I learned basically in the Boston Consulting Group, if you are a very able competitor, you'll create scale advantages\nthat gives you the ability to lock out your competition,\nand as a prime minister, I want to assure that there\nis competition in the market. So you have to limit this competitive power at a certain point. And that becomes increasingly hard in the world where\neverything is intermiss. Where do you define market segments? Where do you define monopoly? How do you do that? That is very, that actually conceptually I find very challenging because of all the dozens of political, of economic reforms that I've made, the most difficult part\nis the conceptual part. Once you have, you've\nironed it out and you say, here's what I want to do,\nhere's the right thing to do, then you have a practical problem of overcoming union resistance,\npolitical resistance, press, opponents from this or that corner. That's a practical matter. But if you have it conceptually defined, you can move ahead to reformed economies or reform education or\nreform transportation, fine, in the question of the growing power of large companies, big tech companies to monopolize the markets\nbecause they're better at it, they provide a service, they provide it lower cost\nat rapidly declining cost. Where do you stop? Where do you stop Monopoly power is a crucial question\nbecause it also becomes now a political question. If you amass enormous\namount of economic power, which is information power, that also monopolizes\nthe political process, which creates, these are real questions that are not obvious. I don't have an obvious\nanswer because as I said, as a 19th century Democrat, these are questions of the 21st century, which people should begin to think. Do you have a solution to that? - The solution of monopolies\ngrowing arbitrarily. - [Benjamin] Yeah. - Unstoppably in power. - In economic power, and\ntherefore in political power. - I mean, some of that is regulation, some of that is competition. - You know where to draw the line? It's not breaking up AT&T,\nit's not that simple. - Well, I believe in\nthe power of competition that there will always be somebody that challenges the big guys, especially in the space of AI. The more open source\nmovements are taking hold, the more the little guy\ncan become the big guy. - So you're saying basically the regulatory instrument is the market. - In large part, in most\npart, that's the hope. Maybe I'm the dreamer. - That's been in many ways\nmy policy up to now, okay. That the best regulator is the market. The best regulator in economic\nactivity is the market. And the best regulator\nin political matters is the political market,\nthat's called elections. That's what regulates, you have a lousy government and\npeople make lousy decisions. Well, you don't need the wise men raised above the masses to decide what is good and what is bad. Let the masses decide, let them vote every\nfour years or whatever, they throw you up, by the\nway, it happened to me, there's life after political death. There's actually political life. I was reelected five or six times, and this is my sixth term. So I believe in that. I'm not sure, I'm not sure\nthat in economic matters, in the geometric growth of tech companies, that you'll always have the\nlittle guy, the nimble mammal, that will come out and slay the dinosaurs or overcome the dinosaurs, which is essentially what you said. - Yeah, I wouldn't count\nout the little guy. - You wouldn't count out the little, well, I hope you're right. - Well, let me ask you about\nthis market of politics."

      "text": "So you have served six\nterms as prime minister over 15 years in power. Let me ask you again, human nature, do you worry about the corrupting nature of power on you as a\nleader, on you as a man? - Not at all. Because I think that again, the thing that drives me is nothing but the mission\nthat I took to assure the survival and thriving of\nthe state, the Jewish state. That is its economic prosperity, but its security and its\nability to achieve peace with our neighbors and\nI'm committed to it. I think there's still, there are many things that have been done. There are a few big things\nthat I can still do, but it doesn't only depend\non my sense of mission. It depends on the market, as we say. It depends really on the\nwill of the Israeli voters and the Israeli voters\nhave decided to vote for me again and again,\neven though I wield no power in the press, no power in many quarters here and so on, nothing. I mean, I am probably, I'm going to be very soon the\nlongest serving prime minister in the last half century\nin the Western democracies. But that's not because I\namassed great political power in any of the institutions. I remember I had a conversation\nwith Silvio Berlusconi, who recently died, and he said\nto me about, I don't know, 15 years ago, something like that. He said, so Bibi, how many of Israel's television\nstations do you have? And I said, none. He said, do you have none? - Do you have? - Do you have I said, none. I have two. He said, no, no, but what you mean you don't have any that you control? I said, not only do I have\nany, none that I control, they're all against me. So he says, so how do you win elections? And with both hands tied behind your back. And I said, the hard way, that's why I have the largest party, but I don't have many more\nseats that I would have if I had sympathetic voice in the media. And Israel until recently was dominated completely by one side\nof the political spectrum that often vilified me, not me, because they viewed me\nas representing basically the conservative voices in\nIsrael that are majority in. So the idea that I'm an omnipotent, authoritarian dictator is ridiculous. I am, I would say I'm\na not merely a champion of democracy and democratization. I believe ultimately the\ndecision is with the voters. And the voters, even though they've had, they have constant,\nconstant press attacks. They've chosen to put me back in. So I don't believe in this\nthing of amassing the corrupting power of, if you don't have\nelections, if you don't have, if you control the means\nof influencing the voters. I understand what you're\nsaying, but in my case, it's exact opposite. I have to constantly go in elections, constantly with a disadvantage that the major media outlets are very violently sometimes against me. But it's fine. And I keep on winning. I don't know what you're talking, I would say the concentration of power lies elsewhere, not here. - Well, you have been involved\nin several corruption cases. How much corruption is there in Israel and how do you fight it in\nyour own party and in Israel? - Well, you should ask\na different question. What's happened to these cases? These cases basically are\ncollapsing, before our eyes, there was recently an\nevent in which the judges, the three judges in my case, called in the prosecution\nand said, your flagship, the bribery charts\nso-called bribery charts, it's gone, doesn't exist before a single defense\nwitness was called. And it sort of tells you that\nthis thing is evaporating. It's quite astounding,\neven that, I have to say, was covered even by the\nmainstream press in Israel, because it's such an earthquake. So, a lot of these charges are not a lot, these charges will prove to be nothing. I always said, listen, I stand\nbefore the legal process. I don't claim that I'm\nexempt from it in any way. On the contrary, I think the truth will come\nout and it's coming out. And we see that not only\nthat, but with other things. So I think it's kind of instructive that no politician has been more vilified. None has been put to such, what is it? About a quarter of a\nbillion shekels were used to scrutinize me, scour my bank account, sending people to the Philippines,\ninto Mexico, into Europe, into America, and looking\nat everybody using spyware, the most advanced spyware on the planet against my associates,\nblackmailing witnesses, telling them, think about your family, think about your wife, you better tell us what you want. All that is coming out in the trial. So I would say that most\npeople now are not asking are no longer asking,\nincluding my opponents. It's sort of trickling in\nas the stuff comes out. People are not saying,\nwhat did Netanyahu do? Because he apparently did nothing. What was done to him is\nsomething that people ask, what was done to, what\nwas done to our democracy, what was done in the\nattempt to put down somebody who keeps winning elections, despite the handicaps that I described. Maybe we can nail him by framing him. And the one thing I can\nsay about this court trial is that things are coming\nout and that's very good. Just objective things are coming out, changing the picture. So I would say the attempt\nto brand me as corrupt is falling on its face. But the thing that is being\nuncovered in the trial, such as the use of spyware on a politician, a\npolitician's surroundings, to try to shake them\ndown in investigations, put them in flea ridden cells for 21 days, invite their 84 year old\nmother to investigations without cause, bringing in their\nmistresses in the corridor, shaking them down. That's what people are asking. That corruption is what\nthey want corrected."

      "text": "- What is the top obstacle to peaceful coexistence of\nIsraelis and Palestinians? Let's talk about the big question of peace in this part of the world. - Well, I think the reason\nyou have the persistence of the Palestinian Israeli conflict, which goes back about a century, is the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize a Jewish\nstate, a nation state for the Jewish people in any boundary. That's why they opposed the establishment of the state of Israel\nbefore we had a state. And that's why they've opposed\nit after we had a state. They opposed it when we were, we didn't have Judea and Samaria, the West Bank in our heads and Gaza. And they opposed it after we have, it doesn't make a difference. It's basically their persistent refusal to recognize a Jewish\nstate in any boundaries. And I think that their\ntragedy is that they've been commandeered for a century\nby leadership that refused to compromise with the idea of Zionism, namely that the Jews\ndeserve a state in this part of the world, the territorial\ndispute is something else. You have a territorial\ndispute if you say, okay, you are living on this side,\nwe're living on that side, let's decide where the\nborder is and so on. That's not what the argument is. The Palestinian society,\nwhich is itself fragmented, but all the factions agree, there shouldn't be a Jewish\nstate anywhere, okay? They just disagree between\nHamas that says, oh, well you should have it, we should get rid of it with terror. And the others who say, we know we should also use\npolitical means to dissolve it. So that is the problem. - So even as part of a two-state solution, they're still against the idea. - Well, they don't want\na state next to Israel. They want a state instead of Israel. And they say, if we get a state, we'll use it as a springboard to destroy the smaller Israeli state, which is what happened when Israel unilaterally\nwalked out of Gaza and effectively established\na Hamas state there. They didn't say, oh, good, now we have our own territory, our own state. Israel is no longer\nthere, let's build peace. Let's build economic projects. Let's enfranchise our people. No, they turned basically\ninto a terror bastion for which they fired\n10,000 rockets into Israel. When Israel left Lebanon, because we had terrorist\nattacks from there. Then we had Lebanon\ntaken over by Hezbollah, a terrorist organization\nthat seeks to destroy Israel. And therefore, every\ntime we just walked out, what we got was not peace. We didn't give territory for peace. We got territory for terror. That's what we had, and that's what would happen as long as the reigning ideology says, we don't want Israel in any border. So the the idea of two states\nassumes that you'd have on the other side a\nstate that wants to live in peace and not one that\nwill be overtaken by Iran and its proxies in two seconds and become a base to destroy Israel. And therefore, I think\nthat most Israelis today, if you ask them, they'd\nsay it's not gonna work in that concept, so what do you do? What do you do with the Palestinians? Okay, they're still there. Unlike them, I don't\nwant to throw them out. They're gonna be living here\nand we're gonna be living here in an area, which is, by\nthe way, just to understand, the area, the entire area\nof so-called West Bank and Israel is the width\nof the Washington Beltway more or less, just a\nlittle more, not much more. You can't really divide it up. You can't say, well,\nyou're gonna gonna fly in. Who controls the airspace? Well, it takes you about\ntwo and a half minutes to cross it with a regular 747, okay? With a fighter plane, it takes you a minute and a half, okay? How are you gonna divide the airspace? Well, you're not gonna divide it. Israel's gonna control that airspace and the electromagnetic space and so on. So security has to be\nin the hands of Israel. My view of how you solve this problem is that is a simple principle. The Palestinians should\nhave all the powers to govern themselves and none of the powers to threaten Israel, which basically means\nthat the responsibility for overall security remains with Israel. And from a practical point of view, we've seen that every time\nthat Israel leaves a territory and takes its security\nforces out of an area, it immediately is overtaken\nby Hamas or Hezbollah or, who basically are committed\nto the destruction of Israel and also bring misery to the Palestinians or Arab subjects. So I think that principle is\nless than perfect sovereignty, because you're taking a\ncertain amount of powers, sovereign powers,\nespecially security away. But I think it's the\nonly practical solution. So people say, ah, but\nit's not a perfect state. I say, okay, call it\nwhat you will call it, I don't know, limited sovereignty, call it autonomy plus, call it\nwhatever you want to call it. But that's the reality, and right now, if you ask Israelis across\nthe political spectrum, except the very hard left,\nmost Israelis agree with that. They don't really debate it. - So two state solution\nwhere Israel controls the security of the entire region. - We don't call it quite that. I mean, there are different names, but the idea is yes,\nIsrael controls security, and is the entire area. It's this tiny area between\nthe Jordan River and the sea. I mean, you can walk it in not one afternoon,\nif you're really fit, you can do it in a day,\nless than a day, I did. - So the expansion of\nsettlements in the West Bank has been a top priority\nfor this new government. So people may harshly\ncriticize this as contributing to escalating the Israel\nPalestine tensions. Can you understand that perspective that this expansion of\nsettlements is not good for this two state solutions? - Yeah, I can understand, I can understand what they're saying, and they don't understand\nwhy they're wrong. First, most Israelis who live in Judea, Samaria live in, in the urban blocks. And that accounts for about\n90% of the population, okay? And everybody recognizes\nthat those urban blocks are gonna be part of Israel\nin any future arrangement. So they're really arguing about something that has already been decided\nand agreed upon really, by Americans, even by Arabs, many Arabs, they don't think that Israel is going to dismantle these blocks. You look outside the window here, and within about a\nkilometer a mile from here is you have Jerusalem, half of Jerusalem grew naturally\nbeyond the old 1967 border. So you're not gonna\ndismantle half of Jerusalem. That's not gonna happen. And most people don't expect that. Then you have the other 10% scattered in tiny, small communities. And people say, well, you're\ngonna have to take them out. Why, why? Remember that in pre 1967, Israel, we have over a million\nand a half Arabs here. We don't say, oh, Israel has\nto be ethnically cleansed from Arabs in order to have, from its Arab citizens\nin order to have peace. Of course not, Jews can live among Arabs, and Arabs can live among Jews. And what is being advanced by those people who say that we can't live in our ancestral homeland\nin these disputed areas. Nobody says that this\nis Palestinian areas, and nobody says that these\nIsraeli areas, we claim them, they claim them. We've only been attached to\nthis land for oh, 3,500 years. But it's a dispute, I agree, but I don't agree that we\nshould throw out the Arabs. And I don't think that they\nshould throw out the Jews. And if somebody said to you, the only way we're gonna\nhave peace with Israel is to have an ethnically\ncleansed Palestinian entity, that's outrageous, if\nyou said the only way, you shouldn't have Jews\nliving in, I don't know, in suburbs of London\nor New York and so on. I don't think that will play too well. The world is actually\nadvancing a solution that says that Jews cannot live among Arabs, and Arabs cannot live among Jews. I don't think that's\nthe right way to do it. And I think there's a solution out there, but I don't think we're gonna get to it, which is less than perfect sovereignty, which involves Israeli security\nmaintained for the entire territory by Israel, which\ninvolves not rooting out anybody. Not kicking out uprooting\nArabs or Palestinians. They're gonna live in\nenclaves in Sovereign Israel. And we're going to live\nprobably in enclaves there, probably through transportation continuity as opposed to territorial continuity. That is, for example, you can have tunnels and overpasses and so on that connect the various communities. We're doing that right now. We're doing that right\nnow, and it actually works. I think there is a solution to this. It's not the perfect world\nthat people think of, because that model I\nthink doesn't apply here if it applies elsewhere, it's a question. I don't think so. But I think there's one other thing, and that's the main thing\nthat I've been involved in. People said, if you don't\nsolve the Palestinian problem, you're not gonna get to\nthe Arab world world. You're not gonna have\npeace with the Arab world. Remember, the Palestinians\nare about 2% of the Arab world and the other 98%, you're not gonna make peace\nwith them and that's our goal. And for a long time, people accepted that after\nthe initial peace treaties with Egypt, with the Prime Minister begging of and President Sudan of Egypt, and then with Jordan\nbetween Prime Minister and King Hussein, for\na quarter of a century, we didn't have any more peace\ntreaties because people said, you gotta go through the\nPalestinians and the Palestinians, they don't want a solution\nof the kind that I described or any kind except the one that involved the dissolution of the state of Israel. So we could wait another half century. And I said, no, I mean, I don't think that we should accept the premise that we have to\nwait for the Palestinians because we'll have to wait forever. So I decided to do it differently. I decided to go directly\nto the Arab Capitals and to make the historic Abraham Accords and essentially reversing the equation, not a peace process that goes inside out, but outside in. And we went directly to\nthese countries and forged these breakthrough peace accords with the United Arab Emirates, with Bahrain, with Morocco and with Sudan. And we're now trying to\nexpand that in a quantum leap with Saudi Arabia. - What does it take to do\nthat with Saudi Arabia, with the Saudi Crown\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman? - I'm a student of history\nand I read a lot of history and I read that in the\nVersailles discussions after World War I, president\nWoodrow Wilson said, I believe in open covenants\nopenly arrived at, I have my correction, I believed in open covenants\nsecretly arrived at, so we're not going to\nadvance a Saudi Israeli peace by having it publicly discussed. And in any case, it's a\ndecision of the Saudis if they want to do it. But there's obviously a mutual interest. So here's my view, if we try to wait for the 2%\nin order to get to the 98%, we're gonna fail and we have failed. If we go to the 98%, we have a much greater\nchance of persuading the 2%. You know why? Because the 2%, the\nPalestinian hope to vanquish the state of Israel and\nnot make peace with it is based among other things on the assumption that eventually the 98%, the rest of the Arab world will kick in and destroy the Jewish state, help them dissolve or\ndestroy the Jewish state. When that hope is taken away, then you begin to have a turn\nto the realistic solutions of coexistence, by the way, they require compromise\non the Israeli side too. I'm perfectly cognizant of\nthat and willing to do that, but I think a realistic\ncompromise will be struck much more readily when the conflict between Israel and the Arab states, the Arab world, is effectively solved. And I think we're on that path,\nit was a conceptual change, I've been involved in a few, I told you the conceptual battle is always the most difficult one. I had to fight this battle to\nconvert a semi-socialist state into a free market capitalist state. And I have to say that\nmost people today recognize the power of competition and\nthe benefits of free markets. So we also had to fight\nthis battle that said, you have to go through the Palestinian strait, STRAIT, to get to the other places. There's no way to avoid this. You have to go through\nthis impassable pass. And I think that now\npeople are recognizing that we'll go around it\nand probably circle back. And that I think actually gives hope not only to have an Arab-Israeli peace, but circling back an\nIsraeli Palestinian piece. And obviously this is not\nsomething that you find in the soundbites and so on, in the popular discussion of the press. But that idea is permeating, and I think it's the right idea. 'Cause I think it's the\nonly one that will work. - So expanding the circle peace, just to linger on that requires what? Secretly talking man\nto man, human to human, to leaders of other nations. - Theoretically, you're right. - Theoretically, okay. Well, let me ask you another\ntheoretical question, on this circle of peace,\nas a student of history, looking at the ideas of war and peace,"

      "text": "what do you think can achieve\npeace in the war in Ukraine looking at another part of the world? If you consider the fight for peace in this part of the world, how can you apply that to\nthat other part of the world between Russia and Ukraine now? - I think it's one of the\nsavage horrors of history and one of the great\ntragedies that is occurring. And let me say in advance that if I have any\nopportunity to use my contacts to help bring about and into\nthis tragedy, I'll do so. I know both leaders,\nbut I don't just jump in and assume, if there's be a desire at a certain point because the conditions have created the possibility\nof helping stop this carnage, then I'll do it. And that's why I choose\nmy words carefully, because I think that may be the best thing that I could do. Look, I think what you see in Ukraine is what happens if you\nhave territorial designs on a territory by a country\nthat has nuclear weapons. And that to me, you see\nthe change in the equation. Now, I think that people are\nloathed to use nuclear weapons, and I'm not sure that I would think that the Russian side would\nuse them with happy abandon. I don't think that's the question, but you see how the whole\nconfiguration changes when that happens. So you have to be very careful on how you resolve this conflict. So it doesn't, well, it\ndoesn't go off the rails, so to speak. That's by the way, the corollary is here. We don't want Iran, which is an aggressive force with a just aggressive\nideology of dominating first the Muslim world and\nthen eliminating Israel and then becoming a global\nforce, having nuclear weapons. It's totally different\nwhen they don't have it than when they do have it. And that's why one of my main\ngoals has been to prevent Iran from having the means of mass destruction, which will be used atomic bombs, which they openly say\nwill be used against us. And you can understand that, how to bring about an end to Ukraine. I have my ideas. I don't think it's worthwhile\ndiscussing them now, because they might be required later on. - Do you believe in the\npower of conversation since you have contacts\nwith Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin, just leaders sitting in\na room and discussing how the end of war can be brought about? - I think it's a combination of that, but I think it's the question of interest and whether you have to get both sides to a point where they think\nthat that conversation would lead to something useful. I don't think they're there right now. - What part of this is just\nbasic human ego stubbornness, all of this between leaders, which is why I bring up\nthe power of conversation, of sitting in a room\nrealizing we're human beings. And then there's a history that\nconnects Ukraine and Russia. - Yeah, I don't think\nthey're in a position to enter a room right now, realistically. I mean, you can posit\nthat it would be good if that could happen,\nbut entering the room is sometimes more complicated\nthan what happens in the room. And there's a lot of\npre-negotiations on the negotiation, then you negotiate endlessly\non the negotiation. They're not even there. - It took a lot of work for you to get a handshake in the past."

      "text": "- It's an interesting question. How did the peace, the Abraham\nAccords, how did that begin? We had decades, 70 years or\n65 years where these people would not meet openly or even secretly with an Israeli leader. Yeah, we had the Mossad making contacts with them all the time and so on. But how do we break the ice to\nthe top level of leadership? Well, we broke the ice because I took a very\nstrong stance against Iran, and the Gulf states understood that Iran is a formidable danger to them. So we had a common interest. And the second thing is that\nbecause of the economic reforms that we had produced in Israel, Israel became a technological powerhouse. And that could help their nations, not only in terms of anything, of just bettering the\nlife of their peoples. And the combination of the desire to have some kind of\nprotection against Iran or some kind of cooperation against Iran and civilian economic\ncooperation came to a head. When I gave a speech in\nthe American Congress, which I didn't do lightheartedly, I had to decide to challenge\na sitting American president on the so-called Iranian deal, which I thought would\npave Iran's path with gold to be an effective nuclear power. That's what would happen. So I went there, and in the\ncourse of giving that speech before the joint session of Congress, our delegation received calls\nfrom Gulf States who said, we can't believe what your\nprime minister is doing. He's challenging the president\nof the United States. Well, I had no choice. I mean, because I thought my country's own existence was imperiled. And remember, we always understand through changing administrations that America under no\nmatter what leadership, is always the irreplaceable and indispensable ally of Israel. And we'll always remain\nthat we can have arguments as we have, but in the family, as we say in the, it's the family. But nevertheless, I was\nforced to take a stand, that produced calls from Gulf States that ultimately led to\nclandestine meetings that ultimately flowered into\nthe Abraham Accords then. And I think we're at a point\nwhere the idea of ending the Arab-Israeli conflict, not the Palestinian Israeli conflict, the Arab-Israeli conflict can happen. I'm not sure it will, it\ndepends on quite a few things, but it could happen. And if it happens, it might open up the ending of\nthe Israeli Islamic conflict. Remember, the Arab world is a small part. It's an important part,\nbut there are large Islamic populations and\ncould bring about an end to an historic enmity\nbetween Islam and Judaism. It could be a great thing. So I'm looking at this larger thing now, you can be hobbled by saying, oh, well, you've had this hiccup in Gaza, or this or that thing happening in the Palestinians. it's important for us\nbecause we want security, but I think the larger question is, can we break out into a much wider peace and ultimately come\nback and make the peace between Israel and the Palestinians, rather than waiting to solve that and never getting to paint\non the larger canvas. I want to paint on the larger canvas and come back to the\nPalestinian Israeli conflict."

      "text": "- As you write about in your book, what have you learned about\nlife from your father? - My father was a great historian, he taught me several things. He said that the first\ncondition for a living organism is to identify danger in time, because if you don't,\nyou could be devoured. You could be destroyed very quickly. And that's the nature of human conflict. In fact, for the Jewish people, we lost the capacity to\nidentify danger in time, and we were almost devoured and destroyed by the Nazi threat. So when I see somebody\nparroting the Nazi goal of destroying the Jewish state, I try to mobilize the\ncountry and the world in time because I think Iran is a global threat, not only a threat to Israel,\nthat's the first thing. The second thing is I once asked him, before I got elected, I said, well, what do you think is the\nmost important quality for a prime minister of Israel? And he came back with a\nquestion, what do you think? And I said, well, you have to have vision and you have to have the\nflexibility of navigating and working towards that vision. Be flexible, but understand\nwhere you're heading. And he said, well, you\nneed that for anything. You need it for, if you're\na university president or if you're a leader of\na corporation or anything, anybody would've to have that. I said, all right, so what do you need to the leader of Israel? He said, he came back to me\nwith a word that stunned me. He said, education, you need\na broad and deep education, or you'll be at the mercy of your clerks or the press or whatever. You have to be able to do that. As I spend time in\ngovernment being reelected by the people of Israel, I recognize more and\nmore how right he was, you need to constantly ask yourself, where's the direction we\nwant to take the country? How do we achieve that goal? But also understand that new\ndisciplines are being added. You have to learn all the time. You have to learn all the time. You have to add to your\nintellectual capital all the time. Kissinger said that, he wrote that once you enter public life, you begin to draw on your\nintellectual capital. And it'll be depleted very\nquickly if you stay a long time. I disagree with that, I\nthink you have to constantly, constantly increase your\nunderstanding of things as they change. Because my father was right, you need to broaden and\ndeepen your education as you go along, you can't just sit back and say, well, I studied some things in\nuniversity or in college, or in Boston or at MIT and that's enough, I've done it, no, learn,\nlearn, learn, learn, learn, never stop. - And if I may suggest,\nas part of the education, I would add in a little literature, maybe Dostoevsky in the plentiful of time you have as a prime minister to read. - Well I read him, but I'll tell you what I think is bigger than Dostoevsky. - Oh, no, who's that? - Not who's that, but what's that? Dan came to see me with his\ngrandson a few years ago, and he asked me, the grandson asked me, he was a student in an Ivy\nLeague college, and he said, he's 18 years old, he wants to study to enter politics. And he said, what's the\nmost important thing that I have to study to\nenter a political life? And I said, you have three\nthings you have to study. Okay? History, history and history. That's the fundamental\ndiscipline for political life. But then you have to study\nother things, study economics, study politics and so on\nand study the military. I had an advantage because\nI spent some years there. So I learned a lot of that, but I had to acquire\nthe other disciplines. And you never acquire enough. So read, read, read. And by the way, if I have to choose, I read history, history and history. Good works of history, not lousy books."

As we spoke, and as I speak now, large scale protests are\nbreaking out all over Israel over this government's\nproposed judicial reform that seeks to weaken the Supreme Court in a bold accumulation of power. Given the current intense\npolitical battles in Israel, our previous intention\nto speak for three hours was adjusted to one\nhour for the time being, but we agreed to speak again\nfor much longer in the future, I will also interview\npeople who harshly disagree with word spoken in this conversation, I will speak with other world leaders, with religious leaders, with\nhistorians and activists, and with people who have\nlived and have suffered through the pain of war, destruction and loss that stoke the fires of anger and hate in their heart. For this, I will travel anywhere\nno matter how dangerous. If there's any chance it may help add to understanding\nand love in the world. I believe in the power of\nconversation to do just this, to remind us of our common humanity. I know I'm underqualified\nand under-skilled for these conversations, so I will often fall short and I will certainly get\nattacked, derided and slandered, but I will always turn the other\ncheek and use these attacks to learn to improve, and no matter what, never give into cynicism. This life, this world\nof ours is too beautiful not to keep trying, trying to do some good in\nwhatever way each of us know how. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman\npodcast, to support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear, dear friends,\nhere's Benjamin Netanyahu. You're loved by many people\nhere in Israel and in the world, but you're also hated by many. In fact, I think you may be one of the most hated men in the world. So if there's a young man\nor a young woman listening to this right now who have\nsuch hate in their heart, what can you say to them to one day turn that hate into love? - I disagree with the\npremise of your question. I think I've enjoyed a very broad support around the world. There are certain corners in\nwhich we have this animosity that you describe and it sort of permeates in some of the newspapers\nand the news organs and so on in the United States. But it certainly doesn't reflect the broad support that I have. I just gave an interview\non an Iranian channel, 16 million viewers. I gave another one, just a\nlittle video a few years ago. 25 million viewers from Iran. Certainly no hate there. I have to tell you, not\nfrom the regime, okay? And when I go around the\nworld and I've been around the world, people want to\nhear what we have to say, what I have to say, as a leader of Israel whom they respect increasingly as a rising power in the world. So I disagree with that. And the most important thing\nthat goes against what you said is the respect that we\nreceived from the Arab world, and the fact that we've made\nfour historic peace agreements with Arab countries, they made it with me. They didn't make it with anyone else. And I respect them and they respect me, and probably more to come. So I think the premise\nis wrong, that's all. - Well, there's a lot of love. Yes, a lot of leaders\nare collaborating are. - Respect, I said not, not love. - Okay, all right. Well, it's a spectrum, but there is people who\ndon't have good things to say about Israel, who do have hate in\ntheir heart for Israel. - [Benjamin] Yeah. - And what can you say to those people? - Well, I think they don't know very much. I think they're guided\nby a lot of ignorance. They don't know about Israel. They don't know that Israel\nis a stellar democracy, that it happens to be one of the most advanced\nsocieties on the planet. That what Israel develops helps humanity in every field in medicine and agriculture and in the environment and telecoms, and talk about AI in a minute, but changing the world for the better and spreading this among six continents. We've sent rescue teams\nmore than any other country in the world, and we're one 10th of 1% of the world's population. But when there's an earth\nearthquake or a devastation in Haiti or in the\nPhilippines, Israel is there. When there's an earthquake, devastating earthquake in\nTurkey, Israel was there. When there's something in\nNepal, Israel is there, and it's the second country. It's the second country\nafter in one case, India or after another case, the\nUnited States, Israel is there. Tiny Israel is a benefactor\nto all of humanity. - So you're a student of history. If I can just linger on that\nphilosophical notion of hate, that part of human nature,\nif you look at World War II, what do you learn from human nature, from the rise of the Third\nReich and the rise of somebody like Hitler and the hate\nthat permeates that? - Well, what I've learned is that you have to nip\nbad things in the bud. You have to, there's a\nLatin term that says. stop bad things when they're small. And the deliberate hatred, the incitement of hatred\nagainst one community, its demonization,\ndelegitimization that goes with it is a very dangerous thing. And that happened in the case of the Jews, what started with the Jews\nsoon spread to all of humanity. So what we've learned is\nthat's what we should never, and I never sit aside and say, oh, they're just threatening to\ndestroy us, they won't do it. If somebody threatens to eliminate you as Iran is doing today,\nand as Hitler did then and people discounted it, well, if somebody\nthreatens to annihilate us, take them seriously and\nact to prevent it early on. Don't let them have the means to do so, because that may be too late. - So in those threats\nunderlying that hatred, how much of it is anti-Zionism and how much of it is anti-Semitism? - I don't distinguish between the two. You can't say, well, I'm okay with Jews, but I just don't think there\nshould be a Jewish state. It's like saying, I'm not anti-American. I just don't think there\nshould be an America. That's basically what people are saying vis-a-vis anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. When you're say anti-Zionism, you're saying the Jewish\npeople don't have a right to have a state of their own. And that is a denial of a basic principle that I think completely\nunmasks what is involved here. Today, anti-Semitism is anti-Zionism. Those who oppose the Jewish\npeople oppose the Jewish state. - If we jump from human history to the current particular moment, there's protests in Israel now about the proposed judicial\nreform that gives power to your government to\noverride the Supreme Court. So the critics say that this\ngives too much power to you, virtually making you a dictator. - Yeah, well, that's ridiculous. The mere fact that you\nhave so many demonstrations and protests, some dictatorship, huh? (person laughing) There's a lot of democracy here. More rambunctious and more robust than just anywhere on the planet. - Can you steel man the case that this may give too much power to the coalition government,\nto the prime minister, not just to you, but to those who follow. - No, I think that's complete hogwash, because I think there's very few people are demonstrating against this. Quite a few, quite many don't have an idea what\nis being discussed, basically being sloganized. You can sloganize, you know something about\nnot mass media right now, but the social network, you can basically feed deliberately with big data and big money. You can just feed slogans\nand get into people's minds. I'm sure you don't think I exaggerate, because you can tell me more about that. And you can create mass mobilization based on these absurd slogans. So here's where we I come\nfrom and what we're doing, what we're trying to do, and what we've changed in\nwhat we're trying to do. I'm a 19th century\ndemocrat in my small D yes, in my views. That is, I asked the\nquestion, what is democracy? Okay, so democracy is\nthe will of the majority and the protection of the rights, they call it the rights of the minority. But I say the rights of\nthe individual, okay. So how do you balance the two? Okay, how do you avoid mobocracy? Okay, and how do you avoid dictatorship? The opposite side, the way you avoid it is something\nthat was built essentially by British philosophers\nand French philosophers, but was encapsulated\nby the founding fathers of the United States. You create a balance\nbetween the three branches of government, okay? The legislative, the\nexecutive and the judiciary. And this balance is\nwhat assures the balance between majority rights\nand individual rights. And you have to balance all of them, okay? That balance was maintained in\nIsrael in its first 50 years, and was gradually overtaken\nand basically broken by the most activist\njudicial court on the planet. That's what happened here. And gradually over the\nlast two, three decades, the court aggregated for itself the powers of the parliament\nand the executive. So we're trying to\nbring it back into line, bringing it back into line, into what is common in all\nparliamentary democracies. And in the United States\ndoesn't mean taking the pendulum from one side and bringing\nit to the other side. We want checks and balances,\nnot unrivaled power, just as we said, we want\nan independent judiciary but not in all powerful judiciary. That balance does not mean\nbringing it back into line. Doesn't mean that you can have the Parliament override any decision that\nthe Supreme Court does. So I pretty much early on said, after the judicial reform was introduced, get rid of the idea of a\nsweeping override clause that would have, with 61\nvotes, that's majority of one. You can just nullify any\nSupreme Court decision. So let's move it back into the center. So that's gone. And most of the criticism\non the judicial reform was based on a an\nunlimited override clause, which I've said is\nsimply not gonna happen. People are discussing some something that already for six\nmonths does not exist. The second point that\nwe received criticism on was the structure of how do you\nchoose Supreme Court judges? Okay, how do you choose them? And the critics of the reform\nare saying that the idea that elected officials should\nchoose Supreme Court judges is the end of democracy. If that's the case, the United\nStates is not a democracy. Neither is France, and neither\nare just, I don't know, just about every, every\ndemocracy on the planet. So there is a view here that\nyou can't have the sorted hands of elected officials involved\nin the choosing of judges. And in the Israeli system, the judicial activism went\nso far that effectively, the sitting judges have an effective veto on choosing judges, which means that this is\na self-selecting court that just perpetrates itself. And we want to correct that, again, want to correct it in a balanced way. And that's basically\nwhat we're trying to do. So I think there's a lot of\nmisinformation about that. We're trying to bring Israeli democracy to where it was in its first 50 years and it was a stellar democracy. It still is, Israel is a\ndemocracy, will remain a democracy, a vibrant democracy. And believe me, the fact that people are arguing and\ndemonstrating in the streets and protesting is the best proof of that. And that's how it'll remain. - We spoke about tech companies offline, there's a lot of tech companies nervous about this judicial reform. Can you speak to why\nlarge and small companies have a future in Israel? - Because Israel is a free market economy. I had something to do with that. I introduced dozens and\ndozens of free market reforms that made Israel move from $17,000 per capita income to within\nvery short time to $54,000. That's nominal GDP per capita, according to the IMF. And we've overtaken in that\nJapan, France, Britain, Germany. And how did that happen? Because we unleashed the genius that we have and the initiative and the entrepreneurship that\nis late in our population. And to do that, we had\nto create free markets. So we created that. So Israel has one of the most\nvibrant free market economies in the world, and the second thing we have is a permanent investment\nin conceptual products, because we have a permanent\ninvestment in the military, in our security services, creating basically knowledge workers who then become knowledge entrepreneurs. And so we create this structure, and that's not gonna go away. There's been a decline in investments in the high tech globally. I think that's driven by many factors. But the most important\none is the interest rate, which I think will, it'll\nfluctuate up and down, but Israel will remain a\nvery attractive country because it produces so many, so many knowledge workers in\na knowledge-based economy. And it's changing so rapidly,\nthe world is changing. You're looking for the\nplaces that have innovation. The future belongs to those who innovate. Israel is the preeminent\ninnovation nation. It has few competitors and\nif we would say, all right, where do you have this close cross-disciplinary fermentation of various skills in areas, I would say it's in Israel\nand I'll tell you why. We used to be just telecoms\nbecause people went out of the military intelligence RNSA. But that's been now broad based. So you find it in medicine, you find it in biology,\nyou find it in agritech, you find it everywhere. Everything is becoming technologized. And in Israel, everybody\nis dealing in everything. And that's a potent reservoir of talent that the world is not gonna pass up. In fact, it's coming to us. We just had Nvidia coming here, and they decided to build\na supercomputer in Israel, wonder why, we've had intel\ncoming here and deciding not to invest $25 billion just\nnow in a new plant in Israel. I wonder why. I don't wonder why, they know why, because the talent is here\nand the freedom is here, then it'll remain so. - So you had a conversation\nabout AI with Sam Altman of OpenAI and with Elon Musk. - Yeah. - What was the content\nof that conversation? What's your vision for sort\nof this very highest of tech, which is artificial intelligence? - Well, first of all, I have a high regard for the people I talk to, okay? I understand that they understand\nthings I don't understand, and I don't pretend to\nunderstand everything. But I do understand one thing. I understand that AI is\ndeveloping at a geometric rate, and mostly in political life. And in life in general, people don't have an intuitive\ngrasp of geometric growth. You understand things\nbasically in linear increments. And the idea that you're\ncoming up a ski slope is very foreign to people,\nso they don't understand it. And they're naturally also\nsort of taken aback by it, because what do you do? Okay, so I think there's\nseveral conclusions from my conversations with them, and from my other observations\nthat I've been talking about for many years, I'm talking\nabout the need to do this. Well, the first thing is this, there is no possibility of not\nentering AI with full force. Secondly, there is a need for regulation. Third, it's not clear\nthere'll be global regulation. Fourth, it's not clear where it ends up. I certainly cannot say that. Now, you might say, does\nit come to control us? Okay, that's a question. Does it come to control us? I don't know the answer to that. I think that as one observation that I had from these conversations is, if it does come to control, is that's probably the only chance of having universal regulation because I don't see anyone deciding to avoid the race and cooperate unless you have that threat, doesn't mean you can't\nregulate AI within countries, even without that understanding. But it does mean that there's\na limit to regulation, because every country will\nwanna make sure that it's not, doesn't give up competitive advantage if there is no universal regulation. I think that right now, 10 years ago I read a novel. I don't read novels, but I was forced to read\none by a scientific advisor. I read history, I read about economics, I read about technology,\nI just don't read novels. Okay, and this time\nfollow Churchill, he said, fact is better than fiction. Well, this fiction would become fact. And it was a book, it was a novel about a Chinese American future cyber war. And I read the book, one sitting called in a team of experts. And I said, all right, let's turn Israel into one of\nthe world's five cyber powers, and let's do it very quickly. And we did actually, we did exactly that. I think AI is bigger than\nthat and related to that, because it'll affect, well,\ncyber affects everything, but AI will affect it\neven more fundamentally. And the joining of the two\ncould be very powerful. So I think in Israel, we have to do it anyway\nfor security reasons, and we're doing it. But I think, what about our databases that are already very robust\non the medical records of 98% of our population? Why don't we stick a\ngenetic database on that? Why don't we do other things\nthat could bring magical what are seemingly magical cures and drugs and medical instruments for that? That's one possibility. We have it as I said,\nin every single field. The conclusion is this,\nwe have to move on AI, we are moving on ai just\nas we moved on cyber. And I think Israel will be one of the leading AI powers in the world. The questions I don't have an\nanswer to is where does it go? How much does it chew up on jobs? There's an assumption\nthat I'm not sure is true, that all previous, the two big previous revolutions\nin the human condition, namely the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution, definitely produced more\njobs than they consumed. Okay, that is not obvious to me at all. I mean, I could see new\njobs creating, and yes, I have that comforting statement, but it's not quite true\nbecause I think on balance, they'll probably consume more jobs, many more jobs than they'll create. - At least in the short term. And we don't know about the long term. - No, I don't know about the long term, but I used to have the comfort\nbeing a free market guy, I always said, we're\ngonna produce more jobs by limiting certain government jobs. We're actually putting out in the market. We'll create more jobs,\nwhich obviously happened. We had one telecom company,\na government company. When I said, we're going to\ncreate competition, they said, you're gonna run us out, we're\nnot gonna have more workers. Yeah, they had 13,000 workers. They went down to seven, but we created another 40,000\nin the other companies. So that was a comforting thought. I always knew that was true, okay? Not only that, I also knew that wealth\nwould spread by opening up the markets completely\nopposite to the socialist and semi-socialist Cree\nthat they had here. They said, you're gonna\nmake the rich richer and the poor poorer, no,\nI made everyone richer. And actually, the people\nwho entered the job market, because of the reforms we did,\nactually became a lot richer. On the lower ladders of\nthe socioeconomic measure. But here's the point, I don't know. I don't know, that we will\nnot have what Elon Musk calls the end of scarcity. So you'll have the end of scarcity, you'll have enormous productivity. Very few people are producing\nenormous added value. You're gonna have to tax that\nto pass it to the others. Okay, you're gonna have to do that. That's a political question. I'm not sure how we answer that. What if you tax and\nsomebody else doesn't tax? You're gonna get everybody to go there. That's an issue, an international issue that we\nconstantly have to deal with. And the second question you have is, suppose you solve that problem\nand you deliver money, okay, to those who are not\ninvolved in the AI economy, what do they do? The first question you ask somebody whom you just met after the polite, the polite exchanges is what do you do? Right, well, people define\nthemselves by their profession. And it's gonna be difficult if\nyou don't have a profession. And people will spend\nmore time self searching, they'll more time in the\narts, more time and leisure. I understand that if I have\nto bet it will annihilate many more jobs, than it will create, and it'll force a structural\nchange in our economics, in our economic models,\nand in our politics. And I'm not sure where it's gonna go. - And that's something\nwe have to respond to at the nation level and just\nas a human civilization, both the threat of AI to\njust us as a human species, and then the effect on the\njobs, and like you said, cybersecurity. - And what do you think, you\nthink we're gonna lose control? - No, I, first of all, I do believe maybe naively\nthat it will create more jobs than it takes. - Write that down and we'll check it. - It's on record. And, we don't say we'll\ncheck it after our lifetime. No, we'll see it in a few years. - We'll see it in a few years. I'm really concerned about\ncybersecurity and the nature of how that changes with the power of AI. And in terms of existential threats, I think there will be so much threats that aren't existential along the way that that's the thing I'm\nmostly concerned about, versus AI taking complete control and becoming sort of\nsuperseding the human species. Although that is something\nyou should consider seriously because of the exponential\ngrowth of its capability. - Yeah, it's exactly\nthe exponential growth which we understand is before\nus, but we don't really, it's very hard to project forward. - [Lex] To really understand. - That's, right, exactly right. So, you know, I deal with what I can and where I can affect something, I tend not to worry about\nthings I don't control. Because at a certain point,\nyou know, there's no point. I mean, you have to decide what you're spending your time on. So I think in practical terms, we'll make Israel a formidable AI power. We understand the limitation\nof scale, computing power and other things. But I think within the, those limits, I think we can make here\nthis miracle that we, we did in many other things,\nwe do more with less. I don't care if it's water, the production of water or\nthe production of energy, energy or the production of\nknowledge or the production of cyber capabilities, defense and other, we just do more with\nless, and I think in AI, we're gonna do a lot more with\nrelatively small but highly gifted population, very gifted. - So taking a small tangent,\nas we talked about offline, you have a background in Taekwondo? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll mention Elon Musk. I've trained with both. Just as a quick question, who are you betting on in a fight? - Well, I refuse to answer that. I will say this. - A politician you are. - Yeah, of course, here, I'm a politician. I'm openly telling you that\nI'm dodging the question. Okay, but I'll say this,\nyou know, I actually, I spent five years in our special forces in the military, and we barely spent a\nminute on martial arts. I actually learned Taekwondo\nlater when I came to, it wasn't even atm, MIT,\nat MIT think I did karate. But when I came to the UN,\nI had a martial arts expert, and he taught me Taekwondo,\nwhich was kind of interesting. Now, the question you\nreally have to ask is, why did we learn martial arts\nin this special elite unit? And the answer is, there's no point. If you saw Indiana Jones,\nyou know, there's no point. You just pull the trigger, that simple. Now, I don't expect\nanyone to pull the trigger on this combat, and I'm sure you'll make\nsure that doesn't happen. - Yeah, I mean, martial\narts is this kind of, it's bigger than just combat. It's this kind of journey\nof humility and it has, it's an art form, it truly is an art. But it's fascinating\nthat these two figures in tech are facing each other. And I won't ask a question\nof who you would face and how you would do, but. - Well, I'm facing opponents all the time. - [Lex] All the time? - Yeah, that's part of life, part of life. - [Lex] Not yet. - Part of life is competition. The only time competition ends is death. But, political life, economic life, cultural life is engaged\ncontinuously in creativity and competition. And the problem I have with\nthat is as I mentioned earlier, just before we began the podcast, is that at a certain point, you want to put barriers to monopoly. And if you are in a\nreally able competitor, you're gonna create a monopoly. That's what Peter Thiel says\nis a natural course of things. It's what I learned basically in the Boston Consulting Group, if you are a very able competitor, you'll create scale advantages\nthat gives you the ability to lock out your competition,\nand as a prime minister, I want to assure that there\nis competition in the market. So you have to limit this competitive power at a certain point. And that becomes increasingly hard in the world where\neverything is intermiss. Where do you define market segments? Where do you define monopoly? How do you do that? That is very, that actually conceptually I find very challenging because of all the dozens of political, of economic reforms that I've made, the most difficult part\nis the conceptual part. Once you have, you've\nironed it out and you say, here's what I want to do,\nhere's the right thing to do, then you have a practical problem of overcoming union resistance,\npolitical resistance, press, opponents from this or that corner. That's a practical matter. But if you have it conceptually defined, you can move ahead to reformed economies or reform education or\nreform transportation, fine, in the question of the growing power of large companies, big tech companies to monopolize the markets\nbecause they're better at it, they provide a service, they provide it lower cost\nat rapidly declining cost. Where do you stop? Where do you stop Monopoly power is a crucial question\nbecause it also becomes now a political question. If you amass enormous\namount of economic power, which is information power, that also monopolizes\nthe political process, which creates, these are real questions that are not obvious. I don't have an obvious\nanswer because as I said, as a 19th century Democrat, these are questions of the 21st century, which people should begin to think. Do you have a solution to that? - The solution of monopolies\ngrowing arbitrarily. - [Benjamin] Yeah. - Unstoppably in power. - In economic power, and\ntherefore in political power. - I mean, some of that is regulation, some of that is competition. - You know where to draw the line? It's not breaking up AT&T,\nit's not that simple. - Well, I believe in\nthe power of competition that there will always be somebody that challenges the big guys, especially in the space of AI. The more open source\nmovements are taking hold, the more the little guy\ncan become the big guy. - So you're saying basically the regulatory instrument is the market. - In large part, in most\npart, that's the hope. Maybe I'm the dreamer. - That's been in many ways\nmy policy up to now, okay. That the best regulator is the market. The best regulator in economic\nactivity is the market. And the best regulator\nin political matters is the political market,\nthat's called elections. That's what regulates, you have a lousy government and\npeople make lousy decisions. Well, you don't need the wise men raised above the masses to decide what is good and what is bad. Let the masses decide, let them vote every\nfour years or whatever, they throw you up, by the\nway, it happened to me, there's life after political death. There's actually political life. I was reelected five or six times, and this is my sixth term. So I believe in that. I'm not sure, I'm not sure\nthat in economic matters, in the geometric growth of tech companies, that you'll always have the\nlittle guy, the nimble mammal, that will come out and slay the dinosaurs or overcome the dinosaurs, which is essentially what you said. - Yeah, I wouldn't count\nout the little guy. - You wouldn't count out the little, well, I hope you're right. - Well, let me ask you about\nthis market of politics. So you have served six\nterms as prime minister over 15 years in power. Let me ask you again, human nature, do you worry about the corrupting nature of power on you as a\nleader, on you as a man? - Not at all. Because I think that again, the thing that drives me is nothing but the mission\nthat I took to assure the survival and thriving of\nthe state, the Jewish state. That is its economic prosperity, but its security and its\nability to achieve peace with our neighbors and\nI'm committed to it. I think there's still, there are many things that have been done. There are a few big things\nthat I can still do, but it doesn't only depend\non my sense of mission. It depends on the market, as we say. It depends really on the\nwill of the Israeli voters and the Israeli voters\nhave decided to vote for me again and again,\neven though I wield no power in the press, no power in many quarters here and so on, nothing. I mean, I am probably, I'm going to be very soon the\nlongest serving prime minister in the last half century\nin the Western democracies. But that's not because I\namassed great political power in any of the institutions. I remember I had a conversation\nwith Silvio Berlusconi, who recently died, and he said\nto me about, I don't know, 15 years ago, something like that. He said, so Bibi, how many of Israel's television\nstations do you have? And I said, none. He said, do you have none? - Do you have? - Do you have I said, none. I have two. He said, no, no, but what you mean you don't have any that you control? I said, not only do I have\nany, none that I control, they're all against me. So he says, so how do you win elections? And with both hands tied behind your back. And I said, the hard way, that's why I have the largest party, but I don't have many more\nseats that I would have if I had sympathetic voice in the media. And Israel until recently was dominated completely by one side\nof the political spectrum that often vilified me, not me, because they viewed me\nas representing basically the conservative voices in\nIsrael that are majority in. So the idea that I'm an omnipotent, authoritarian dictator is ridiculous. I am, I would say I'm\na not merely a champion of democracy and democratization. I believe ultimately the\ndecision is with the voters. And the voters, even though they've had, they have constant,\nconstant press attacks. They've chosen to put me back in. So I don't believe in this\nthing of amassing the corrupting power of, if you don't have\nelections, if you don't have, if you control the means\nof influencing the voters. I understand what you're\nsaying, but in my case, it's exact opposite. I have to constantly go in elections, constantly with a disadvantage that the major media outlets are very violently sometimes against me. But it's fine. And I keep on winning. I don't know what you're talking, I would say the concentration of power lies elsewhere, not here. - Well, you have been involved\nin several corruption cases. How much corruption is there in Israel and how do you fight it in\nyour own party and in Israel? - Well, you should ask\na different question. What's happened to these cases? These cases basically are\ncollapsing, before our eyes, there was recently an\nevent in which the judges, the three judges in my case, called in the prosecution\nand said, your flagship, the bribery charts\nso-called bribery charts, it's gone, doesn't exist before a single defense\nwitness was called. And it sort of tells you that\nthis thing is evaporating. It's quite astounding,\neven that, I have to say, was covered even by the\nmainstream press in Israel, because it's such an earthquake. So, a lot of these charges are not a lot, these charges will prove to be nothing. I always said, listen, I stand\nbefore the legal process. I don't claim that I'm\nexempt from it in any way. On the contrary, I think the truth will come\nout and it's coming out. And we see that not only\nthat, but with other things. So I think it's kind of instructive that no politician has been more vilified. None has been put to such, what is it? About a quarter of a\nbillion shekels were used to scrutinize me, scour my bank account, sending people to the Philippines,\ninto Mexico, into Europe, into America, and looking\nat everybody using spyware, the most advanced spyware on the planet against my associates,\nblackmailing witnesses, telling them, think about your family, think about your wife, you better tell us what you want. All that is coming out in the trial. So I would say that most\npeople now are not asking are no longer asking,\nincluding my opponents. It's sort of trickling in\nas the stuff comes out. People are not saying,\nwhat did Netanyahu do? Because he apparently did nothing. What was done to him is\nsomething that people ask, what was done to, what\nwas done to our democracy, what was done in the\nattempt to put down somebody who keeps winning elections, despite the handicaps that I described. Maybe we can nail him by framing him. And the one thing I can\nsay about this court trial is that things are coming\nout and that's very good. Just objective things are coming out, changing the picture. So I would say the attempt\nto brand me as corrupt is falling on its face. But the thing that is being\nuncovered in the trial, such as the use of spyware on a politician, a\npolitician's surroundings, to try to shake them\ndown in investigations, put them in flea ridden cells for 21 days, invite their 84 year old\nmother to investigations without cause, bringing in their\nmistresses in the corridor, shaking them down. That's what people are asking. That corruption is what\nthey want corrected. - What is the top obstacle to peaceful coexistence of\nIsraelis and Palestinians? Let's talk about the big question of peace in this part of the world. - Well, I think the reason\nyou have the persistence of the Palestinian Israeli conflict, which goes back about a century, is the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize a Jewish\nstate, a nation state for the Jewish people in any boundary. That's why they opposed the establishment of the state of Israel\nbefore we had a state. And that's why they've opposed\nit after we had a state. They opposed it when we were, we didn't have Judea and Samaria, the West Bank in our heads and Gaza. And they opposed it after we have, it doesn't make a difference. It's basically their persistent refusal to recognize a Jewish\nstate in any boundaries. And I think that their\ntragedy is that they've been commandeered for a century\nby leadership that refused to compromise with the idea of Zionism, namely that the Jews\ndeserve a state in this part of the world, the territorial\ndispute is something else. You have a territorial\ndispute if you say, okay, you are living on this side,\nwe're living on that side, let's decide where the\nborder is and so on. That's not what the argument is. The Palestinian society,\nwhich is itself fragmented, but all the factions agree, there shouldn't be a Jewish\nstate anywhere, okay? They just disagree between\nHamas that says, oh, well you should have it, we should get rid of it with terror. And the others who say, we know we should also use\npolitical means to dissolve it. So that is the problem. - So even as part of a two-state solution, they're still against the idea. - Well, they don't want\na state next to Israel. They want a state instead of Israel. And they say, if we get a state, we'll use it as a springboard to destroy the smaller Israeli state, which is what happened when Israel unilaterally\nwalked out of Gaza and effectively established\na Hamas state there. They didn't say, oh, good, now we have our own territory, our own state. Israel is no longer\nthere, let's build peace. Let's build economic projects. Let's enfranchise our people. No, they turned basically\ninto a terror bastion for which they fired\n10,000 rockets into Israel. When Israel left Lebanon, because we had terrorist\nattacks from there. Then we had Lebanon\ntaken over by Hezbollah, a terrorist organization\nthat seeks to destroy Israel. And therefore, every\ntime we just walked out, what we got was not peace. We didn't give territory for peace. We got territory for terror. That's what we had, and that's what would happen as long as the reigning ideology says, we don't want Israel in any border. So the the idea of two states\nassumes that you'd have on the other side a\nstate that wants to live in peace and not one that\nwill be overtaken by Iran and its proxies in two seconds and become a base to destroy Israel. And therefore, I think\nthat most Israelis today, if you ask them, they'd\nsay it's not gonna work in that concept, so what do you do? What do you do with the Palestinians? Okay, they're still there. Unlike them, I don't\nwant to throw them out. They're gonna be living here\nand we're gonna be living here in an area, which is, by\nthe way, just to understand, the area, the entire area\nof so-called West Bank and Israel is the width\nof the Washington Beltway more or less, just a\nlittle more, not much more. You can't really divide it up. You can't say, well,\nyou're gonna gonna fly in. Who controls the airspace? Well, it takes you about\ntwo and a half minutes to cross it with a regular 747, okay? With a fighter plane, it takes you a minute and a half, okay? How are you gonna divide the airspace? Well, you're not gonna divide it. Israel's gonna control that airspace and the electromagnetic space and so on. So security has to be\nin the hands of Israel. My view of how you solve this problem is that is a simple principle. The Palestinians should\nhave all the powers to govern themselves and none of the powers to threaten Israel, which basically means\nthat the responsibility for overall security remains with Israel. And from a practical point of view, we've seen that every time\nthat Israel leaves a territory and takes its security\nforces out of an area, it immediately is overtaken\nby Hamas or Hezbollah or, who basically are committed\nto the destruction of Israel and also bring misery to the Palestinians or Arab subjects. So I think that principle is\nless than perfect sovereignty, because you're taking a\ncertain amount of powers, sovereign powers,\nespecially security away. But I think it's the\nonly practical solution. So people say, ah, but\nit's not a perfect state. I say, okay, call it\nwhat you will call it, I don't know, limited sovereignty, call it autonomy plus, call it\nwhatever you want to call it. But that's the reality, and right now, if you ask Israelis across\nthe political spectrum, except the very hard left,\nmost Israelis agree with that. They don't really debate it. - So two state solution\nwhere Israel controls the security of the entire region. - We don't call it quite that. I mean, there are different names, but the idea is yes,\nIsrael controls security, and is the entire area. It's this tiny area between\nthe Jordan River and the sea. I mean, you can walk it in not one afternoon,\nif you're really fit, you can do it in a day,\nless than a day, I did. - So the expansion of\nsettlements in the West Bank has been a top priority\nfor this new government. So people may harshly\ncriticize this as contributing to escalating the Israel\nPalestine tensions. Can you understand that perspective that this expansion of\nsettlements is not good for this two state solutions? - Yeah, I can understand, I can understand what they're saying, and they don't understand\nwhy they're wrong. First, most Israelis who live in Judea, Samaria live in, in the urban blocks. And that accounts for about\n90% of the population, okay? And everybody recognizes\nthat those urban blocks are gonna be part of Israel\nin any future arrangement. So they're really arguing about something that has already been decided\nand agreed upon really, by Americans, even by Arabs, many Arabs, they don't think that Israel is going to dismantle these blocks. You look outside the window here, and within about a\nkilometer a mile from here is you have Jerusalem, half of Jerusalem grew naturally\nbeyond the old 1967 border. So you're not gonna\ndismantle half of Jerusalem. That's not gonna happen. And most people don't expect that. Then you have the other 10% scattered in tiny, small communities. And people say, well, you're\ngonna have to take them out. Why, why? Remember that in pre 1967, Israel, we have over a million\nand a half Arabs here. We don't say, oh, Israel has\nto be ethnically cleansed from Arabs in order to have, from its Arab citizens\nin order to have peace. Of course not, Jews can live among Arabs, and Arabs can live among Jews. And what is being advanced by those people who say that we can't live in our ancestral homeland\nin these disputed areas. Nobody says that this\nis Palestinian areas, and nobody says that these\nIsraeli areas, we claim them, they claim them. We've only been attached to\nthis land for oh, 3,500 years. But it's a dispute, I agree, but I don't agree that we\nshould throw out the Arabs. And I don't think that they\nshould throw out the Jews. And if somebody said to you, the only way we're gonna\nhave peace with Israel is to have an ethnically\ncleansed Palestinian entity, that's outrageous, if\nyou said the only way, you shouldn't have Jews\nliving in, I don't know, in suburbs of London\nor New York and so on. I don't think that will play too well. The world is actually\nadvancing a solution that says that Jews cannot live among Arabs, and Arabs cannot live among Jews. I don't think that's\nthe right way to do it. And I think there's a solution out there, but I don't think we're gonna get to it, which is less than perfect sovereignty, which involves Israeli security\nmaintained for the entire territory by Israel, which\ninvolves not rooting out anybody. Not kicking out uprooting\nArabs or Palestinians. They're gonna live in\nenclaves in Sovereign Israel. And we're going to live\nprobably in enclaves there, probably through transportation continuity as opposed to territorial continuity. That is, for example, you can have tunnels and overpasses and so on that connect the various communities. We're doing that right now. We're doing that right\nnow, and it actually works. I think there is a solution to this. It's not the perfect world\nthat people think of, because that model I\nthink doesn't apply here if it applies elsewhere, it's a question. I don't think so. But I think there's one other thing, and that's the main thing\nthat I've been involved in. People said, if you don't\nsolve the Palestinian problem, you're not gonna get to\nthe Arab world world. You're not gonna have\npeace with the Arab world. Remember, the Palestinians\nare about 2% of the Arab world and the other 98%, you're not gonna make peace\nwith them and that's our goal. And for a long time, people accepted that after\nthe initial peace treaties with Egypt, with the Prime Minister begging of and President Sudan of Egypt, and then with Jordan\nbetween Prime Minister and King Hussein, for\na quarter of a century, we didn't have any more peace\ntreaties because people said, you gotta go through the\nPalestinians and the Palestinians, they don't want a solution\nof the kind that I described or any kind except the one that involved the dissolution of the state of Israel. So we could wait another half century. And I said, no, I mean, I don't think that we should accept the premise that we have to\nwait for the Palestinians because we'll have to wait forever. So I decided to do it differently. I decided to go directly\nto the Arab Capitals and to make the historic Abraham Accords and essentially reversing the equation, not a peace process that goes inside out, but outside in. And we went directly to\nthese countries and forged these breakthrough peace accords with the United Arab Emirates, with Bahrain, with Morocco and with Sudan. And we're now trying to\nexpand that in a quantum leap with Saudi Arabia. - What does it take to do\nthat with Saudi Arabia, with the Saudi Crown\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman? - I'm a student of history\nand I read a lot of history and I read that in the\nVersailles discussions after World War I, president\nWoodrow Wilson said, I believe in open covenants\nopenly arrived at, I have my correction, I believed in open covenants\nsecretly arrived at, so we're not going to\nadvance a Saudi Israeli peace by having it publicly discussed. And in any case, it's a\ndecision of the Saudis if they want to do it. But there's obviously a mutual interest. So here's my view, if we try to wait for the 2%\nin order to get to the 98%, we're gonna fail and we have failed. If we go to the 98%, we have a much greater\nchance of persuading the 2%. You know why? Because the 2%, the\nPalestinian hope to vanquish the state of Israel and\nnot make peace with it is based among other things on the assumption that eventually the 98%, the rest of the Arab world will kick in and destroy the Jewish state, help them dissolve or\ndestroy the Jewish state. When that hope is taken away, then you begin to have a turn\nto the realistic solutions of coexistence, by the way, they require compromise\non the Israeli side too. I'm perfectly cognizant of\nthat and willing to do that, but I think a realistic\ncompromise will be struck much more readily when the conflict between Israel and the Arab states, the Arab world, is effectively solved. And I think we're on that path,\nit was a conceptual change, I've been involved in a few, I told you the conceptual battle is always the most difficult one. I had to fight this battle to\nconvert a semi-socialist state into a free market capitalist state. And I have to say that\nmost people today recognize the power of competition and\nthe benefits of free markets. So we also had to fight\nthis battle that said, you have to go through the Palestinian strait, STRAIT, to get to the other places. There's no way to avoid this. You have to go through\nthis impassable pass. And I think that now\npeople are recognizing that we'll go around it\nand probably circle back. And that I think actually gives hope not only to have an Arab-Israeli peace, but circling back an\nIsraeli Palestinian piece. And obviously this is not\nsomething that you find in the soundbites and so on, in the popular discussion of the press. But that idea is permeating, and I think it's the right idea. 'Cause I think it's the\nonly one that will work. - So expanding the circle peace, just to linger on that requires what? Secretly talking man\nto man, human to human, to leaders of other nations. - Theoretically, you're right. - Theoretically, okay. Well, let me ask you another\ntheoretical question, on this circle of peace,\nas a student of history, looking at the ideas of war and peace, what do you think can achieve\npeace in the war in Ukraine looking at another part of the world? If you consider the fight for peace in this part of the world, how can you apply that to\nthat other part of the world between Russia and Ukraine now? - I think it's one of the\nsavage horrors of history and one of the great\ntragedies that is occurring. And let me say in advance that if I have any\nopportunity to use my contacts to help bring about and into\nthis tragedy, I'll do so. I know both leaders,\nbut I don't just jump in and assume, if there's be a desire at a certain point because the conditions have created the possibility\nof helping stop this carnage, then I'll do it. And that's why I choose\nmy words carefully, because I think that may be the best thing that I could do. Look, I think what you see in Ukraine is what happens if you\nhave territorial designs on a territory by a country\nthat has nuclear weapons. And that to me, you see\nthe change in the equation. Now, I think that people are\nloathed to use nuclear weapons, and I'm not sure that I would think that the Russian side would\nuse them with happy abandon. I don't think that's the question, but you see how the whole\nconfiguration changes when that happens. So you have to be very careful on how you resolve this conflict. So it doesn't, well, it\ndoesn't go off the rails, so to speak. That's by the way, the corollary is here. We don't want Iran, which is an aggressive force with a just aggressive\nideology of dominating first the Muslim world and\nthen eliminating Israel and then becoming a global\nforce, having nuclear weapons. It's totally different\nwhen they don't have it than when they do have it. And that's why one of my main\ngoals has been to prevent Iran from having the means of mass destruction, which will be used atomic bombs, which they openly say\nwill be used against us. And you can understand that, how to bring about an end to Ukraine. I have my ideas. I don't think it's worthwhile\ndiscussing them now, because they might be required later on. - Do you believe in the\npower of conversation since you have contacts\nwith Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin, just leaders sitting in\na room and discussing how the end of war can be brought about? - I think it's a combination of that, but I think it's the question of interest and whether you have to get both sides to a point where they think\nthat that conversation would lead to something useful. I don't think they're there right now. - What part of this is just\nbasic human ego stubbornness, all of this between leaders, which is why I bring up\nthe power of conversation, of sitting in a room\nrealizing we're human beings. And then there's a history that\nconnects Ukraine and Russia. - Yeah, I don't think\nthey're in a position to enter a room right now, realistically. I mean, you can posit\nthat it would be good if that could happen,\nbut entering the room is sometimes more complicated\nthan what happens in the room. And there's a lot of\npre-negotiations on the negotiation, then you negotiate endlessly\non the negotiation. They're not even there. - It took a lot of work for you to get a handshake in the past. - It's an interesting question. How did the peace, the Abraham\nAccords, how did that begin? We had decades, 70 years or\n65 years where these people would not meet openly or even secretly with an Israeli leader. Yeah, we had the Mossad making contacts with them all the time and so on. But how do we break the ice to\nthe top level of leadership? Well, we broke the ice because I took a very\nstrong stance against Iran, and the Gulf states understood that Iran is a formidable danger to them. So we had a common interest. And the second thing is that\nbecause of the economic reforms that we had produced in Israel, Israel became a technological powerhouse. And that could help their nations, not only in terms of anything, of just bettering the\nlife of their peoples. And the combination of the desire to have some kind of\nprotection against Iran or some kind of cooperation against Iran and civilian economic\ncooperation came to a head. When I gave a speech in\nthe American Congress, which I didn't do lightheartedly, I had to decide to challenge\na sitting American president on the so-called Iranian deal, which I thought would\npave Iran's path with gold to be an effective nuclear power. That's what would happen. So I went there, and in the\ncourse of giving that speech before the joint session of Congress, our delegation received calls\nfrom Gulf States who said, we can't believe what your\nprime minister is doing. He's challenging the president\nof the United States. Well, I had no choice. I mean, because I thought my country's own existence was imperiled. And remember, we always understand through changing administrations that America under no\nmatter what leadership, is always the irreplaceable and indispensable ally of Israel. And we'll always remain\nthat we can have arguments as we have, but in the family, as we say in the, it's the family. But nevertheless, I was\nforced to take a stand, that produced calls from Gulf States that ultimately led to\nclandestine meetings that ultimately flowered into\nthe Abraham Accords then. And I think we're at a point\nwhere the idea of ending the Arab-Israeli conflict, not the Palestinian Israeli conflict, the Arab-Israeli conflict can happen. I'm not sure it will, it\ndepends on quite a few things, but it could happen. And if it happens, it might open up the ending of\nthe Israeli Islamic conflict. Remember, the Arab world is a small part. It's an important part,\nbut there are large Islamic populations and\ncould bring about an end to an historic enmity\nbetween Islam and Judaism. It could be a great thing. So I'm looking at this larger thing now, you can be hobbled by saying, oh, well, you've had this hiccup in Gaza, or this or that thing happening in the Palestinians. it's important for us\nbecause we want security, but I think the larger question is, can we break out into a much wider peace and ultimately come\nback and make the peace between Israel and the Palestinians, rather than waiting to solve that and never getting to paint\non the larger canvas. I want to paint on the larger canvas and come back to the\nPalestinian Israeli conflict. - As you write about in your book, what have you learned about\nlife from your father? - My father was a great historian, he taught me several things. He said that the first\ncondition for a living organism is to identify danger in time, because if you don't,\nyou could be devoured. You could be destroyed very quickly. And that's the nature of human conflict. In fact, for the Jewish people, we lost the capacity to\nidentify danger in time, and we were almost devoured and destroyed by the Nazi threat. So when I see somebody\nparroting the Nazi goal of destroying the Jewish state, I try to mobilize the\ncountry and the world in time because I think Iran is a global threat, not only a threat to Israel,\nthat's the first thing. The second thing is I once asked him, before I got elected, I said, well, what do you think is the\nmost important quality for a prime minister of Israel? And he came back with a\nquestion, what do you think? And I said, well, you have to have vision and you have to have the\nflexibility of navigating and working towards that vision. Be flexible, but understand\nwhere you're heading. And he said, well, you\nneed that for anything. You need it for, if you're\na university president or if you're a leader of\na corporation or anything, anybody would've to have that. I said, all right, so what do you need to the leader of Israel? He said, he came back to me\nwith a word that stunned me. He said, education, you need\na broad and deep education, or you'll be at the mercy of your clerks or the press or whatever. You have to be able to do that. As I spend time in\ngovernment being reelected by the people of Israel, I recognize more and\nmore how right he was, you need to constantly ask yourself, where's the direction we\nwant to take the country? How do we achieve that goal? But also understand that new\ndisciplines are being added. You have to learn all the time. You have to learn all the time. You have to add to your\nintellectual capital all the time. Kissinger said that, he wrote that once you enter public life, you begin to draw on your\nintellectual capital. And it'll be depleted very\nquickly if you stay a long time. I disagree with that, I\nthink you have to constantly, constantly increase your\nunderstanding of things as they change. Because my father was right, you need to broaden and\ndeepen your education as you go along, you can't just sit back and say, well, I studied some things in\nuniversity or in college, or in Boston or at MIT and that's enough, I've done it, no, learn,\nlearn, learn, learn, learn, never stop. - And if I may suggest,\nas part of the education, I would add in a little literature, maybe Dostoevsky in the plentiful of time you have as a prime minister to read. - Well I read him, but I'll tell you what I think is bigger than Dostoevsky. - Oh, no, who's that? - Not who's that, but what's that? Dan came to see me with his\ngrandson a few years ago, and he asked me, the grandson asked me, he was a student in an Ivy\nLeague college, and he said, he's 18 years old, he wants to study to enter politics. And he said, what's the\nmost important thing that I have to study to\nenter a political life? And I said, you have three\nthings you have to study. Okay? History, history and history. That's the fundamental\ndiscipline for political life. But then you have to study\nother things, study economics, study politics and so on\nand study the military. I had an advantage because\nI spent some years there. So I learned a lot of that, but I had to acquire\nthe other disciplines. And you never acquire enough. So read, read, read. And by the way, if I have to choose, I read history, history and history. Good works of history, not lousy books. - Last question. You've talked about a\nsurvival of a nation. You yourself are a mortal being. Do you contemplate your mortality? Do you contemplate your death,\nare you afraid of death? - Aren't you? - [Lex] Yes. - Who is not? I mean, if you're conscience, if you're being with conscience, I mean, one of the unhappy things\nabout the human brain is that it can contemplate its own demise. And so we have to, we all make\nour compromises with this. But I think the question is what lives on, what lives on beyond us? And I think that you have to define how much of posterity do\nyou want to influence? I cannot influence the course of humanity. We are specks, little specks. So that's not the issue, but in my case, I've devoted my life to\na very defined purpose. And that is to assure\nthe future and security, I would say permanence. But that is obviously a limited thing of the Jewish state and the Jewish people. I don't think one can\nexist without the other. So I've devoted my life\nto that, and I hope that in my time on this earth\nand in my years in office, I'd have contributed to that. - Well, you had one heck of a life starting from MIT to six\nterms as Prime Minister. Thank you for this stroll\nthrough human history and for this conversation,\nit was an honor. - Thank you, and I hope you\ncome back to Israel many times. Remember, it's the innovation nation. It's a robust democracy. Don't believe all the stuff\nthat you are being told. It'll remain that it\ncannot be any other way. And I'll tell you the other thing. It's the best ally of the United States, and its importance is growing by the day. Because our capacities\nin the information world are growing by the day. We need a coalition of\nthe like-minded smarts. This is a smart nation. And we share the basic values of freedom and liberty with the United States. So coalition of the smarts means Israel is the sixth eye and\nAmerica has no better ally. - All right, now off mic, I'm gonna force you to finally\ntell me who was gonna win. Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg. But t's a good time to end, we ran out of time here. - I'll tell you outside. - Thanks for listening\nto this conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu.

And now let me leave you with some words from Mahatma Gandhi. \"An eye for an eye will only\nmake the whole world blind.\" Thank you for listening and\nhope to see you next time."
